Exchange regime. Since February 2, 2009 Zimbabwe has adopted hard currencies
for transactions. On March 19, 2009, the South African rand was announced as the
reference currency. Zimbabwe dollar-denominated currency is not functional, and
there is no functioning foreign exchange market for Zimbabwe dollars. The de facto
exchange arrangement is classified as other managed exchange arrangement.
Exchange restrictions. Based on available information, Zimbabwe has eliminated
the multiple currency practices identified in the last Article IV staff report. It has
also lifted many of the controls on current account transactions under newly issued
exchange control regulations. The staff is still reviewing the new foreign exchange
regulations and their implementations to determine whether there remain any
restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction.
Data. Data have serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance due to
capacity constraints.
The previous Article IV consultation discussions were concluded on
February 23, 2007. The related documents have not been published.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background. The economic and humanitarian situation worsened dramatically in 2008.
Hyperinflation, fueled by the RBZ’s quasi-fiscal activities, and a further significant
deterioration in the business climate contributed to an estimated 14 percent fall in real GDP
in 2008, on top of a 40 percent cumulative decline during the period of 2000–07.
Unemployment, poverty, malnutrition, and incidence of infectious diseases have risen
sharply.
The official adoption of hard currencies for transactions in early 2009 recognized the de facto
virtually complete dollarization of Zimbabwe’s economy. The government also recently
announced that the rand would be the reference currency. Dollarization has helped stabilize
prices, improve revenue performance, and impose fiscal discipline, including on the RBZ.
Outlook. Reversing output decline and improving social conditions would require
determined efforts to maintain sound macroeconomic policies, and to attract domestic and
foreign investors and significant donor support. In the absence of cash budget support, higher
humanitarian assistance, and wage restraint, the economic and social situation could
deteriorate significantly in 2009. Zimbabwe’s external debt burden is unsustainable even if
policies are improved and medium-term financing gaps are filled by concessional financing.
Policy discussions. The staff welcomed the authorities’ commitment to refrain from quasifiscal activities and implement cash budgeting (i.e., matching monthly expenditure to
monthly revenue) in 2009. Given a sizable unfilled budget financing gap projected by the
staff and the necessity to cover critical humanitarian expenses that are not provided for in the
budget, the government would need to improve revenue performance, contain the wage bill,
enhance public financial management, and seek donor financial and humanitarian assistance.
There was broad agreement that the official adoption of hard currencies for transactions had
provided a strong nominal anchor. To improve the functioning of the new monetary
framework, in line with staff recommendations, the authorities intend to enable the payments
system to process transaction in foreign exchange and attune banking supervision to new
risks. The merits of reviving the national currency and appropriate preconditions (e.g.,
macroeconomic stability and a credible legal framework) will be considered in late 2009.
Further progress in structural reforms is essential for reviving economic growth and reducing
poverty. The authorities are committed to maintain recently adopted critical measures,
including price and exchange regime liberalization, and imposition of hard budget constraints
on parastatals. The staff encouraged the authorities to forge a political consensus over
reforms aimed at ensuring protection of property rights and the rule of law. It also cautioned
against trade protectionism and wage increases beyond levels justified by productivity.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Zimbabwe’s economic and social situation deteriorated significantly over the last
ten years, culminating in a severe humanitarian crisis in 2008. During the period 1999–
2008, real GDP shrank by more than 40 percent. Decade-long high inflation spiraled out of
control and reached unprecedented levels in 2008 (Table 1). Over the last ten years, there has
been no significant progress in achieving Millennium Development Goals (MDG), and in
some areas––child and maternal mortality—MDG indicators have deteriorated (Table 2). At
present, almost 70 percent of the population are in need of food assistance and a cholera
epidemic is ravaging the country. These disastrous outcomes have resulted from poor policies
and weak governance.
2.
The formation of the government of national unity in February 2009 opens the
door for tackling the difficult economic and humanitarian crisis facing the country. The
new government has started to address the most pressing short-term economic recovery needs
and has initiated work on medium-term reforms. In this context, the consultation
discussions focused on
•

the post-hyperinflation transition to sound fiscal management and the need to ensure
the delivery of essential public services;

•

the appropriate nominal anchor and banking system issues; and

•

key growth- and competitiveness-oriented structural reforms.
II. SPONTANEOUS STABILIZATION

complete dollarization1 in late 2008. Twelve-month consumer price index (CPI) inflation is

The collapse in economic activity and public services contributed to a significant
deterioration in the humanitarian situation in 2008. Economic disruptions caused by
hyperinflation and a further significant deterioration in the business climate led to an
estimated 14 percent decline in real GDP in 2008 (Table 2). Poverty and unemployment have
risen to catastrophic levels, with 70 percent of the population in need of food assistance and
the cholera epidemic claiming more than 4,000 lives.

The external position remained precarious in 2008. The current account deficit
increased to 28 percent of GDP in 2008, from 11 percent in 2007 (Table 3). In 2008, exports
declined on account of the disruptive domestic economic environment and a fall in
international commodity prices. Higher food and fuel prices, as well as increased volumes
of donor-financed humanitarian aid (US$490 million) and capital grants (US$80 million),
led to a significant increase in imports. The current account deficit was mainly financed by
a further accumulation of external payments arrears, a decline in net international reserves,
large RBZ external borrowing, a sizable decline in banks’ foreign assets, and modest
private capital inflows (foreign direct investment and short-term suppliers credits). At end2008, gross international reserves amounted to US$6 million, while external debt is estimated
at US$6.0 billion (189 percent of GDP), of which arrears accounted for US$3.8 billion
(120 percent of GDP).2 Overdue financial obligations to the IMF amounted to
SDR 89 million (US$133 million) at end-March 2009.

External debt arrears include initial principle and interest obligations in arrears, and estimated penalties on
interest and principle arrears.

6.
In 2008, unprecedented money growth fueled hyperinflation (Figure 1). The
monetization of the RBZ’s massive quasi-fiscal activities led to a rapid increase in banks’
deposits with the RBZ and ultimately in local currency M3.3 However, the printing press was
not able keep pace with the expansion of local currency M3, which led to cash shortages and
a significant divergence between the parallel cash and electronic transaction exchange rates.
As inflation accelerated in the third quarter of 2008, real money demand and the parallel
market exchange rates collapsed. As a result, at the UN exchange rate of Z$35 quadrillion
(1015) per US$1,4 reserve money declined to an equivalent of about US$7 million and local
currency-denominated M3, to US$6 million by end-2008. Foreign currency deposits are
estimated at about US$300 million at end-2008 (Table 4).
7.
The RBZ’s quasi-fiscal activities increased in 2008. Estimated at US$1.1 billion
(36 percent of GDP) in 2008 (US$0.8 billion, 23 percent of GDP in 2007), they included
election-related expenses, transfers to parastatals, subsidized directed lending, below-cost
provision of equipment and fertilizers to farmers, and allocation of foreign exchange at
subsidized exchange rates. These expenses were mainly financed by surrender requirements
on export proceeds, the retention of foreign exchange earnings of the gold and agricultural
sectors in excess of mandatory surrender requirements, the confiscation of most foreign
currency deposits, external borrowing, purchases of foreign exchange at the parallel market
exchange rates, and monetization.

The expansion of the quasi-fiscal activities took place in the context of weak RBZ
governance and accountability. Specifically, the composition of the RBZ Board is not fully
consistent with the RBZ Act, which hampers effective oversight of RBZ operations. The
RBZ financial reporting practices do not adhere to international standards in many areas,
including inadequate disclosure of operations of its subsidiaries. The RBZ 2008 financial
statements expressed in Zimbabwe dollars may not represent a true and fair view because of
hyperinflation and the multiplicity of exchange rates.

The central government’s revenue and expenditure effectively collapsed in 2008.
With economic decline and a rapid erosion of the real value of accrued tax liabilities (Tanzi
effect), budget revenue fell from almost US$1 billion (25 percent of GDP) in 2005 to
US$133 million (4 percent of GDP) in 2008. Expenditure shrank from about US$1.4 billion
(37 percent of GDP) in 2005 to US$258 million (8 percent of GDP) in 2008 causing an
almost complete collapse in the provision of public services (Table 5). With public sector

A further deterioration in the business climate exacerbated the economic decline
in 2008. A tightening of price controls and exchange restrictions, a pickup in land invasions,
the confiscation of foreign currency deposits, and frequent changes in business regulations
made it more difficult to conduct business in Zimbabwe. The country continues to rank low
in terms of ease of doing business among regional comparators.

In early 2009, the authorities announced a transition to a multi-currency system.
Under this system, transactions in foreign currency are authorized, payments of most taxes
are mandatory in foreign exchange, trading at the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange is conducted in
foreign exchange, and many foreign exchange restrictions on current account transactions are
liberalized. The Zimbabwe dollar remains legal tender, but this provision is not enforced, and

III. DISCUSSIONS OF THE AUTHORITIES’ EMERGENCY RECOVERY PROGRAM
13.
Against the backdrop of the acute economic and humanitarian crisis, the
recently formed government of national unity prepared a Short-Term Emergency
Recovery Program (STERP) for 2009.5 This program focuses on macroeconomic policy
and supply-side measures aimed at achieving low inflation, arresting economic decline, and
improving social conditions.
14.
The authorities emphasized that low inflation would be maintained based on
strict fiscal discipline and a strong nominal anchor. Specifically, the RBZ has been
mandated to stop quasi-fiscal activities, and cash budgeting (i.e., matching monthly
expenditure to monthly revenue) will be implemented in 2009. To this end, the government
revised down the initial 2009 budget’s unrealistic revenue and expenditure estimates by
nearly 50 percent. The authorities underscored that credibility of their fiscal efforts is
underpinned by their inability to rely on inflationary sources of financing under the dollarized
system and their commitment to price liberalization and imposition of hard budget constraints
on parastatals.
A. Implementing Cash Budgeting While Addressing Critical Social Needs
15.
The revised 2009 budget6 targets a balanced fiscal position on a month-by-month
basis. The authorities expect that hard currency budget revenue, which rose from
US$6 million in January 2009 to US$31 million in February 2009, would steadily increase in
the course of 2009 and would reach US$1 billion (29 percent of GDP), as economic activity
picks up. Customs duties, excises, and the value-added tax (VAT) are expected to account for
60 percent of budget revenue. Expenditure, including those quasi-fiscal operations that were
transferred to the treasury, is budgeted at US$1 billion. This would represent an expenditure
cut of 15 percent of GDP compared with the 2008 outturn for budgetary expenditure and the
RBZ’s quasi-fiscal operations (Table 5).
16.
The authorities acknowledged that budget revenue estimates of the 2009 revised
budget may not fully materialize. They noted the staff’s estimate that revenue would be
US$100–US$150 million lower (Table 5) and indicated that they would consider revenue
measures in the context of a planned July 2009 budget revision to address downside risks to
revenue. These measures may include increasing royalties on mineral resources and
broadening the VAT and customs tax bases. In addition, the government intends to enhance
the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority’s capacity to assess taxes in foreign exchange and
automate recording of tax payments in multiple currencies.

17.
The authorities and staff agreed that the revised 2009 budget expenditure was
understated and higher humanitarian assistance was needed to ensure the provision of
critical public services. The authorities noted the staff’s estimate that overhead expenses of
public institutions and essential transfers to key parastatals were understated by at least
US$80 million (Table 5). In addition, they saw a need for an increase of US$200–
US$300 million dollars in humanitarian assistance compared with the 2008 outturn, which
would be required to provide sufficient food relief, contain the cholera epidemic, and address
critical needs in health and education sectors.
18.
There is significant political pressure to increase public sector wages. The staff
underscored the importance of maintaining the wage bill within the budget allocation on
affordability and competitiveness grounds. The authorities indicated that maintaining the
current flat civil service allowance of US$100 per month would be detrimental to morale.
While the authorities shared the staff’s concern that a civil service pay rise may lead to an
unaffordable increase in the wage bill (which is already higher than those in low-income
neighboring countries) and may undermine competitiveness, they felt that some
decompression of the wage scale would be justified in 2009 to improve motivation and
retention of skilled civil servants. In this regard, the authorities indicated that they would
conduct a government payroll audit with a view to removing ghost workers. After reassessing
the revenue forecast and prospective financial assistance flows in July 2009, the authorities
would consider decompressing the wage scale while maintaining the wage bill within a fully
financed budgetary envelope.

be particularly large during the first half of 2009, when budget revenue can only cover the
wage bill, public sector pensions, and a fraction of overhead costs of public institutions. The
staff and the authorities shared a view that domestic financing would only be possible in very
limited amounts. Therefore, in the absence of donor financial support, the government would

13
be bound to reduce expenditures on social programs, postpone public investment projects,
and incur payments arrears, which could contribute to a deterioration in the social and
economic situation.
Large unfilled budget financing gaps are expected in the first half of 2009

20.
The government intends to address significant weaknesses in public financial
management. To this end, it is working on resolving technical and legal issues related to the
transition to a multi-currency treasury account in the banking system and improving
procedures for budgetary cash management and expenditure control with the advice of the
World Bank. The authorities concurred that sound public financial management was essential
for unlocking donor support.
B. Maintaining Official Dollarization as the Nominal Anchor
21.
The authorities saw the multi-currency system with the rand as the reference
currency as the essential element of their stabilization strategy. With widespread
dollarization and lack of a strong institutional framework ensuring credibility and
accountability of the central bank, the multi-currency system was the only realistically
feasible and credible monetary framework. The authorities justified their choice of the rand as
the reference currency by optimal currency area considerations and potential significant
benefits of closer regional integration. Given the adoption of the rand as the reference
currency, the authorities concurred with the staff’s recommendations to present the next
budget in rands, and mandate tax assessments in rands and adopt the rand as the sole unit of
account for the public and private sectors in the near future.
22.
The authorities intend to address outstanding banking sector issues to facilitate
payment services and improve credit availability in the near term. They agreed with the
staff recommendation that there was an urgent need to enable the domestic payments system
to process payments in foreign exchange and attune banking system supervision to the needs

14
of the multi-currency system. In addition, the RBZ plans to conduct a thorough review of the
financial conditions of individual banks based on their end-March 2009 balance sheets
translated into foreign currency and address identified vulnerabilities, which may include
capital erosion due to hyperinflation and increased risks of currency mismatches and
illiquidity under the multi-currency system. The authorities and the staff also discussed ways
to improve liquidity management in a dollarized environment, including through the
introduction of limited lender of last resort operations provided funding for such operations
can be mobilized. The authorities are seeking technical assistance in these areas.
23.
The authorities agreed that RBZ governance needed to be strengthened. As a
first step in this direction, the staff underscored the importance of ensuring compliance with
the RBZ Act’s accountability requirements. In line with staff recommendations, the minister
of finance intends to recommend five non-Executive Board members who should be
appointed by the President by end-April 2009. The government also noted that the Board
would seek to ensure effective oversight of RBZ operations, including through a thorough
review of the 2008 audited financial statements of the RBZ and its subsidiaries, the
submission to the minister of finance of the 2009 budget consistent with the RBZ’s refocused
functional responsibilities, and close monitoring of the RBZ’s international reserves
management, and borrowing, guaranteeing, and pledging activities.
24.
Merits of a revival of the national currency will be considered at the end of 2009.
The authorities concurred with the staff that the multi-currency system should be maintained
until prerequisites for a revival of the national currency are met, which may take some time.
There was convergence of views on key prerequisites, including the establishment of a track
record of sound fiscal policy implementation, the achievement of a sustainable external
position, the resumption of economic growth, and adoption of new central bank legislation
focusing on price stability and ensuring central bank credibility and accountability. In the
meantime, the government is considering repurchasing local currency-denominated reserve
money, which the staff supported.
C. Pressing Ahead with Structural Reforms to Enhance Growth Potential and
Competitiveness
25.
The government is committed to maintaining critical policies that have already
been implemented. These include price liberalization, the removal of surrender requirements
and most exchange restrictions, the imposition of hard budget constraints on parastatal
enterprises, and the elimination of the Grain Marketing Board monopoly.
26.
The authorities intend to boost the real economy through a number of
supporting policies. While they are considering merits of tax incentives, subsidies,
preferential treatment of specific sectors, and trade protection measures, they highlighted that
these measures would be implemented on a limited basis. The staff cautioned against
protectionism and unaffordable tax incentives, while highlighting the need to make

15
Zimbabwe’s producers competitive in foreign markets through improvements in the business
climate.
27.
There is consensus among domestic and foreign investors, as well as donors and
representatives of civil society, that respect of property rights and the rule of law are
essential for reviving investment and economic growth. The STERP recognizes the
urgency of addressing these issues and formulates general principles of land reform and
measures pertaining to the enforcement of property rights in other areas. The staff called for
drafting, adopting, and implementing the necessary legislative acts ensuring protection of
property rights in close cooperation with all the stakeholders. Government officials
underscored that adoption and implementation of the necessary legislation would require
strong political will among coalition partners to find a workable solution to these issues.
28.
The government is initiating a comprehensive review of parastatal enterprises.
The authorities re-iterated their commitment to impose hard budget constraints on parastatal
enterprises by eliminating quasi-fiscal subsidies previously extended to them by the RBZ.
They stated that price liberalization would help some parastatals regain financial viability.
The staff encouraged the authorities to follow through with the STERP’s commitments to
restructure, privatize, or liquidate nonviable parastatals in the medium term to ensure that
they do not burden the budget. The authorities are seeking technical advice in this area from
the World Bank and the African Development Bank.
IV. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
29.
Based on discussions with the authorities, the mission prepared an illustrative
macroeconomic scenario (Tables 1 and 6). It assumes that staff recommendations and the
authorities’ policy intentions, as discussed above, are fully implemented. The authorities
concurred with the main conclusions of the baseline scenario and the assessment of risks.
30.
In staff’s view, an economic turnaround would not be possible without foreign
assistance and private capital inflows, even assuming sound policy implementation. The
fiscal discipline imposed by the multi-currency system would underpin a reduction in CPI
inflation (in U.S. dollar terms) below 10 percent in 2009. Low inflation, the on-going
liberalization of economic activities, and a gradual pickup in financial intermediation would
help arrest the decade-long economic decline in 2009. The significant improvement in
Zimbabwe’s terms of trade projected by the IMF’s World Economic Outlook, and an
expected increase in foreign credit lines and private capital inflows would also support
economic growth. However, for real GDP growth to turn positive in 2009, in addition to
sound policies, as described above, official budget support of at least US$200 million
(6 percent of GDP)7 would need to be mobilized. Furthermore, humanitarian assistance in the
7

South Africa is in discussions with Zimbabwe’s authorities on a possible provision of R 300 million
(US$33 million) to fill part of this gap.

16
areas of food relief, health, and education may need to increase by US$200–US$300 million
in 2009. Despite a brighter short-term macroeconomic outlook, Zimbabwe will not be able to
discharge its external debt service obligations in 2009.
31.

There are significant downside risks to the short-term outlook:

•

Political disagreements among coalition partners may emerge, potentially resulting in
policy reversals.

•

Budget revenue and foreign financing shortfalls could lead to a large compression in
expenditure, which, in turn, may trigger social unrest.

•

If wages exceeded levels justified by the economy’s productivity, competitiveness
could suffer, resulting in output contraction and higher unemployment.

•

The banking system, which has become more fragile because of hyperinflation, is
subject to new risks under the multi-currency system. If these risks were not
addressed in a timely manner, the intermediation capacity of the banking system
would not improve and growth would suffer.

•

If projected external private and official inflows, including financing to close the
external gap, did not materialize, under the virtually complete dollarization, the
resulting liquidity squeeze could lead to deflation.

•

Significant capacity constraints pose a high risk to the implementation of the
authorities’ emergency recovery program.

32.
Large financing gaps would persist over the medium term. Based on illustrative
estimates, for real GDP growth to reach 5–6 percent per year over the medium term, there
would need to be a significant improvement in policies, including sound macroeconomic
management, a substantial strengthening in the investment climate (in particular, ensuring
protection of property rights and the rule of law), competitive wage levels, a further progress
in deepening financial intermediation, as well as sizable donor support and debt relief.
33.
Zimbabwe is in debt distress. Under the baseline Debt Sustainability Analysis
(Appendix I) scenario assuming relatively optimistic assumptions on policies and the external
environment, the present value of external debt-to-exports ratio is expected to persist above
250 percent for almost a decade, reflecting the initial external debt overhang and sizable
gross financing requirements.

17
V. OTHER ISSUES
34.
The authorities intend to improve timeliness of data reporting and transparency
of government and RBZ operations. The government intends to ensure timely compilation,
reporting, and publication of standard monthly monetary and fiscal statistics in foreign
currency terms.
35.
The government attaches significant importance to the normalization of
relations with external creditors. It acknowledged that sound policy implementation and
bilateral donors’ support are key preconditions for a resolution of overdue financial
obligations to official creditors. The authorities also intend to start reconciling external debt
numbers with creditors as an important step toward a comprehensive assessment of the
country’s repayment capacity.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
Zimbabwe is at a critical juncture. Following years of high inflation, economic
decline, and rising poverty, the recently formed government of national unity has a historic
opportunity to improve prospects for economic growth and poverty reduction. Strong
policies, better governance, and donor support are critical for a successful reconstruction of
the Zimbabwe economy.
37.
The short-term macroeconomic outlook has improved but it is subject to
significant downside risks. The government’s STERP and the revised 2009 budget contain a
number of important macroeconomic policy and structural measures that would support a
private sector-led economic turnaround in a low-inflation environment in 2009. However,
downside risks to the economic recovery are significant. Potential political instability and
implementation capacity constraints may undermine reform efforts. In addition, the 2009
revised budget has a large unfilled financing gap which can grow larger if civil service wages
are raised. Also, private capital inflows and donor support may not pick up as expected by the
authorities.
38.
The government’s STERP put forward sound principles of macroeconomic
management. The government’s commitment to eliminate quasi-fiscal activities and
implement cash budgeting (i.e., matching monthly expenditure to monthly revenue) is
welcome. The credibility of this approach to fiscal management is reinforced by the decision
to maintain the multi-currency system because under such a system it is not possible to
monetize the budget deficit.
39.
Maintaining fiscal discipline and mobilizing donor budget support is key to
preserving macroeconomic and social stability. The authorities need to follow through
with their plans to improve tax administration and review the tax regime to increase budget
revenues. With regard to expenditure, it would be important to maintain the wage bill within
the budgeted amount, improve public financial management systems, allocate sufficient
resources to critical social and infrastructure needs, and resist pressures from parastatals to
finance nonessential activities. Given the sizable unfilled budget financing gap and the

18
necessity to cover critical humanitarian expenses that are not provided for in the budget, the
government needs to intensify its efforts in mobilizing donor budget support and increased
humanitarian assistance.
40.
The government’s decision to anchor expectations by maintaining the multicurrency system with the rand as the reference currency is appropriate under current
circumstances. Repurchasing the remaining amount of local currency-denominated reserve
money and strengthening accountability and transparency of the RBZ’s operations in
conformity with the RBZ Act would strengthen the credibility of the current monetary
framework. An eventual reintroduction of the national currency can only succeed if a sound
track record of policy implementation is established and a credible institutional framework
underpinning central bank operations with a focus on price stability is adopted and
implemented.
41.
Banking system issues need to be addressed without delay. Enabling the payments
system to process transactions in foreign exchange, identifying and addressing vulnerabilities
in the banking system, and implementing a sound liquidity management framework would be
essential for catalyzing financial reintermediation.
42.
The revival of the economy depends critically on quickly attracting private
domestic and foreign investors and improving competitiveness. Specifically, the
government needs to ensure protection of property rights, maintain the rule of law, guard
against trade protectionism, and pursue prudent wage and income policies. Also,
commendable efforts in reestablishing market signals through price liberalization and the
elimination of many exchange restrictions need to be sustained.
43.
Even if policies were improved and private sector inflows increased, large
external financing gaps would persist and external debt would remain unsustainable
over the medium term. In this regard, establishing a track record of sound policy
implementation is a critical first step to resolving overdue financial obligations to official
creditors, including the IMF, and ultimately securing donor financial support for the
reconstruction of Zimbabwe’s economy. The authorities are urged to resume payments to the
Fund as soon as Zimbabwe’s payment capacity improves.
44.
Significant improvement is needed in all areas of economic statistics, and
transparency of government and RBZ operations. Priority should be given to timely
compilation, reporting, and dissemination of standard monthly monetary and fiscal statistics,
financial soundness indicators for the banking system, as well as the reconciliation of debt
data with external creditors. It would also be important to publish the 2008 audited financial
statements of the RBZ and all its subsidiaries.
45.
It is proposed that Zimbabwe remain on the standard 12-month consultation
cycle.

Appendix I. Debt Sustainability Analysis8
46.
Zimbabwe’s debt sustainability analysis (DSA) exercise is subject to major
caveats. While the authorities have begun to shore up their debt management capacity,
external debt and debt service data are not reconciled with the creditors’ data and remain
incomplete. Data deficiencies are compounded by the difficulty in making medium- and longterm projections because of the country’s poor policy record. Against this background, the
DSA projections and simulations can only be considered as highly indicative.
47.
Zimbabwe is in debt distress. Even under relatively optimistic assumptions on
policies and the external environment, most debt ratios are projected to remain at
unsustainable levels over the medium and long term. Under the historic sensitivity analysis,
debt ratios are projected to increase over the long term from the current unsustainable levels.
Public and publicly guaranteed external debt sustainability
48.
The starting external debt level is high. At end-2008, the staff estimates that
Zimbabwe’s nominal medium- and long-term public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external
debt stood at US$5.1 billion (166 percent of GDP).9 Scheduled service of PPG external debt
in 2009 is equivalent to 14 percent of projected exports and 28 percent of projected
government revenue (Table 7).
49.
The baseline scenario assumes improvements in policies and a reversal of
Zimbabwe’s decade-long economic contraction. In particular, the scenario is built on
implementation of sound macroeconomic policies and essential structural reforms as
discussed in Section IV of the staff report. Annual real GDP growth is projected at 6 percent
during the period of 2010–15 and 5.5 percent thereafter. The noninterest external current
account deficit would initially fall––from 25 percent of GDP in 2010 to 14 percent of GDP
in 2015—but would then decline more gradually. It is assumed that private capital inflows
can only cover a fraction of gross external financing requirements. Because there are no
commitments of concessional financing or debt relief, for illustrative purposes, external
financing gaps are identified and assumed to be financed on highly concessional terms. The
scenario also assumes some real effective exchange rate appreciation reflecting positive
productivity differentials with trading partners.
8

The DSA was undertaken by the Fund staff, in collaboration with the World Bank staff. It uses the standard
Bank/Fund templates and sensitivity analyses for low-income countries (LICs) to assess Zimbabwe’s debt
dynamics.

9

Staff estimates of the stock of external PPG medium- and long-term debt include (i) external PPG mediumand long-term debt based on original maturities; (ii) domestic foreign currency-denominated debt; (iii) arrears
on intial principal and interest obligations; and (iv) estimated accrued penalties on arrears.

28
50.
Under the baseline scenario, PPG external debt indicators are projected to
remain far in excess of the corresponding thresholds for a LIC that is a poor
performer.10 These debt ratios begin at levels some three to five times above the thresholds.
They would decline only gradually and approach the threshold levels after 20 to 30 years,
assuming that external gaps are filled with concenssional financing (as mentioned above).
51.
The sensitivity analysis demonstrates an extreme fragility of Zimbabwe’s
external debt position. Reflecting the poor past macroeconomic performance, under the
historical scenario, all external debt indicators are projected to increase continuously over the
long term.
Public debt sustainability
52.
The baseline scenario assumes improvements in fiscal policy implementation.
Budget revenue is projected to increase from 25 percent of GDP in 2009 to 30 percent
in 2014 and beyond on account of better tax policy and administration. While the wage bill is
assumed to be contained, large humanitarian and infrastructure rehabilitation needs would
justify a significant increase in expenditure over the medium term. As a result, projected
budget gross financing requirements are large over the medium term, but they are expected to
decline over the longer term. For illustrative purposes, unidentified financing is reflected in
budget financing gaps.
53.
The starting level of domestic government debt is moderate, and prudent
domestic debt management policy is assumed going forward. Local currencydenominated domestic debt was fully repaid in late January 2009. The RBZ’s foreign
currency-denominated domestic debt (which is added to total domestic public debt for the
purpose of this DSA) is estimated at US$457 million (13 percent of GDP) at endDecember 2008. The baseline scenario assumes modest government domestic borrowing
in 2009 and over the medium term. As a result, domestic government debt-to-GDP ratios are
projected to decline gradually over the medium and long term.
54.
However, under the baseline scenario, Zimbabwe’s overall public debt11 is
unsustainable. The initial external public debt overhang and large budget financing
requirements would prevent public external debt ratios from reaching sustainable levels in the
medium and even long term. Public debt is projected to gradually decline from a peak of
over 200 percent of GDP in 2010 to about 150 percent a decade later. The PV of the public
10

Zimbabwe is treated as a weak policy performer for the specific purposes of this LIC DSA. The policy-based
thresholds for the present value (PV) of PPG external debt are therefore low: 200 percent of revenue;
100 percent of exports; and 30 percent of GDP.
11

Including the domestic and external debt of both central government and parastatals.

29
debt-to-revenue ratio remains above 400 percent through 2018; and the debt service-torevenue ratio only falls below 20 percent in 2014.

IX. Application of Remedial Measures under the Arrears Strategy
Zimbabwe has been in continuous arrears to the Fund since February 2001. On September 24,
2001, the Executive Board declared Zimbabwe ineligible to use the general resources of the Fund
and removed it from the list of PRGF-ESF-eligible countries. On June 13, 2002, the Board issued a
declaration of non-cooperation with respect to Zimbabwe and suspended all technical assistance to
the country. On June 6, 2003, the Board suspended Zimbabwe’s voting and related rights in the
Fund. A complaint with respect to compulsory withdrawal was issued on February 6, 2004. The
Executive Board considered the complaint on July 7, 2004, on February 15, 2005, and again on
September 9, 2005 and decided to postpone the recommendation on Zimbabwe’s compulsory
withdrawal from the Fund to the Board of Governors so as to give more time for Zimbabwe to
improve cooperation with the Fund. On February 15, 2006, Zimbabwe fully settled its arrears to
the General Resources Account. As a consequence, the Managing Director withdrew his complaint
for compulsory withdrawal. However, the Executive Board decided not to restore Zimbabwe’s
voting and related rights, nor did it terminate Zimbabwe’s ineligibility to use the general resources
of the Fund. The Executive Board kept in place the decisions taken to address Zimbabwe’s arrears
to the PRGF-ESF Trust—the declaration of noncooperation, the suspension of technical assistance,
and the removal of Zimbabwe from the list of PRGF-ESF-eligible countries. Zimbabwe’s arrears to
the PRGF-ESF Trust remain, amounting to SDR 89 million (US$133 million) as of March 31,
2009. The last review of Zimbabwe’s overdue financial obligations to the PRGF-ESF Trust was
completed in January 2009, and the Executive Board decided that the measures to address
Zimbabwe’s arrear to the PRGF-ESF Trust shouldl remain in place.
B. Nonfinancial Relations
X. Exchange Arrangement
Since February 2, 2009 Zimbabwe has adopted hard currencies for transactions. On March
19, 2009, the South African rand was announced as the reference currency. Zimbabwe dollardenominated currency is not functional. Following the abolition of the surrender
requirements on foreign exchange proceeds on March 19, 2009, there has not been
functioning foreign exchange market for Zimbabwe dollars. Many controls on international
payments and transfers have also been lifted under newly issued exchange control directives.
Based on available information, Zimbabwe has eliminated the multiple currency practices.
The staff is still reviewing the newly adopted foreign exchange regulations and their
implementation to determine whether there remain any restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction.
XI. Article IV Consultation
Zimbabwe is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The Executive Board discussed
the staff report for the 2006 consultation on February 23, 2007.

APPENDIX III. ZIMBABWE—STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of April 13, 2009
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data have serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance. There are
serious shortcomings in all major datasets. Given the deterioration in technical capacity and
quality of institutions, Zimbabwe will need substantial technical assistance across a broad
front to improve data quality and timeliness. The Central Statistics Office (CSO) needs to
rebuild its capacity and acquire new equipment. Zimbabwe participates in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) project for Anglophone African countries. All technical
assistance from the Fund has been suspended since June 13, 2002, when the Executive Board
issued a declaration of noncooperation regarding Zimbabwe.
National Accounts: The most recent publication of national accounts data includes
developments until 2005 and uses 1990 as the base year for constant prices. The production
of national accounts is constrained by both insufficient input data and processing capacity.
Benchmark data for industrial production is based on a survey made in 1999 and services are
based on a survey made in 1981. The last income, consumption, and expenditure survey of
any reasonable quality was made in 2001 (a survey made in 2007/08 collected data that is
distorted due to hyperinflation). At the same time, some input data, for example a recent
agriculture and livestock survey, remains unprocessed due to insufficient capacity. Following
the abandonment of the Zimbabwe dollar, the CSO needs to change the accounting of
economic activity into Rand (the chosen reference currency).
Price statistics: The CSO published a new consumer price index (CPI) based on prices in
U.S. dollars, with December 2008 as the base, for the first time on March 24, 2009. Data on
employment and wages are no longer published, and a new labor force and child labor survey
will be needed to revive the publication of comprehensive labor statistics.
Government finance statistics: The Ministry of Finance (MoF) does not report on fiscal
developments at the general government level, including local governments and the Reserve
Bank of Zimbabwe’s (RBZ) quasi-fiscal activities. Hyperinflation and staff absences have
rendered the collection and reporting of public finance statistics for the central government
very challenging during the past 18 months. The MoF has continued to collect data on
revenue, expenditure, and debt through this period, but the last reliable consolidated quarterly
bulletin on fiscal developments was published in the first quarter of 2007.

6

Monetary statistics: The RBZ produces monthly monetary and financial statistics with a lag
of three to six months. The quality of the data has deteriorated substantially over the years
because of hyperinflation, weak accounting practices, multiple exchange rates, growing
quasi-fiscal activities, and a series of re-denominations of the Zimbabwe dollar. As a result, it
is difficult to reconcile the RBZ’s data with the government’s reports on bank financing.
Discrepancies often reflect numerous changes in the classification of various quasi-fiscal
activities and different exchange rates used for various operations. In addition, financial
institutions currently use historical cost accounting for their financial statements, which in
combination with hyperinflation makes it difficult to detect true vulnerabilities in the
financial system. The 2009 Article IV mission advised the authorities on the compilation of
net international reserves data, including identification of encumbered assets and the need to
ensure completeness of foreign currency liabilities.
External sector statistics: Balance of payments and external debt statistics are subject to a
number of data issues. Labor income and workers’ remittances do not include estimates of
cash and in-kind transfers from Zimbabweans working abroad. Interest payments are not
reconciled with creditors’ records and do not contain accrued interest on overdue financial
obligations. Current and capital transfers to nongovernmental organizations and to the
government are not fully reconciled with donors’ data. The financial account is incomplete,
as it does not record substantial transactions in assets that are reported by central banks that
are members of the Bank for International Settlements. The RBZ’s initial submission of
flows and stocks of gross international reserves and its net foreign assets position often
require substantial adjustments. Exceptional financing does not fully capture the flow of
overdue financial obligations. External sector data are reported to the staff irregularly with
significant delays.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Not a General Data Dissemination System
participant.

No data ROSC is available.

III. Reporting to STA
Zimbabwe does not report balance of payments statistics to STA for redissemination in the
International Financial Statistics or the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook. No
monetary or fiscal data are currently reported to STA for publication in the International
Financial Statistics.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 6, 2009

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with Zimbabwe
On May 4, 2009 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Zimbabwe.1
Background
Economic and social indicators in Zimbabwe worsened significantly in 2008. Real Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) is estimated to have fallen by about 14 percent in 2008 (on top of a
40 percent cumulative decline during the period of 2000–07) due to economic disruptions
caused by hyperinflation and a further significant deterioration in the business climate. Poverty
and unemployment have risen to catastrophic levels, with 70 percent of the population in need
of food assistance and a cholera epidemic claiming more than 4,000 lives.
In 2008, quasi-fiscal activities undertaken by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) increased
in the context of weak RBZ governance. They are estimated at US$1.1 billion (36 percent of
GDP) in 2008, and included election-related expenses, transfers to parastatals, subsidized
directed lending, subsidized provision of equipment and fertilizers to farmers, and allocation of
foreign exchange at subsidized exchange rates. Besides monetization, these activities were
financed by surrender requirements on export proceeds, the retention of foreign exchange
earnings of the gold and agricultural sectors in excess of mandatory surrender requirements, a
freeze of most foreign currency deposits, external borrowing, and purchases of foreign
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Chairman of the Board summarizes the
views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

exchange at the parallel market exchange rates. These large operations unrelated to central
banking core activities were conducted in the context of weak oversight of RBZ operations.
Key governance weaknesses include lack of enforcement of the RBZ Act’s accountability
requirements and noncompliance with the International Financial Reporting Standards.
The central government’s revenue and expenditure effectively collapsed in 2008. With
economic decline and hyperinflation eroding the real value of accrued tax liabilities, budget
revenue fell from almost US$1 billion (25 percent of GDP) in 2005 to US$133 million (4
percent of GDP) in 2008. Expenditure shrank from about US$1.4 billion (37 percent of GDP) in
2005 to US$258 million (8 percent of GDP) in 2008 causing an almost complete collapse in the
provision of public services, including a significant reduction in electricity generation capacity,
collapse of water supply, and major disruptions in railway services.
Unprecedented hyperinflation led to the disappearance of the local currency and a contraction
of the financial system in 2008. Fueled by the monetization of the RBZ’s quasi-fiscal
operations, twelve-month CPI inflation is estimated to have peaked in September 2008 at
almost 500 billion (109) percent. Since October–November 2008, the local currency has
virtually disappeared from circulation and dollarization has gained momentum. The banking
system shrank, as reflected in deposits that declined from almost US$1 billion at end-2005 to
about US$300 million (of which local currency-denominated deposits amounted to an
equivalent of US$6 million) at end-2008.
With the demise of the Zimbabwe dollar hyperinflation has stopped. De facto dollarization was
recognized by the official transition to use of hard currencies for transactions and adoption of
the rand as the reference currency in early 2009. Under this monetary system, transactions in
hard currencies are authorized, payments of most taxes are mandatory in foreign exchange,
trading at the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange is conducted in foreign exchange, and many foreign
exchange restrictions on current account transactions are liberalized. During January–
February 2009, the CPI in U.S. dollar terms experienced a decline.
The short-term macroeconomic outlook is uncertain. The government’s short-term emergency
recovery program and the revised 2009 budget contain a number of important macroeconomic
and structural policy commitments which, if fully implemented and supported by donor
assistance, could lay the foundation for a private sector-led economic recovery in a lowinflation environment. However, there are significant downside risks to the economic recovery
due to potential policy reversals.
Executive Board Assessment
A decade of high inflation, severe economic decline, and rising poverty has culminated in an
acute, ongoing humanitarian crisis. Directors considered that Zimbabwe is now at a critical
juncture. They welcomed the efforts by the recently formed government of national unity to
seize the historic opportunity to improve prospects for economic growth and poverty reduction
by forging the necessary political consensus among all stakeholders for ambitious reforms.

3
Directors welcomed the authorities’ Short-Term Emergency Recovery Program (STERP) that
is based on sound principles of macroeconomic management. They underscored that following
through with the STERP’s commitment to establish fiscal discipline, eliminate quasi-fiscal
activities, maintain a multi-currency monetary framework, and accelerate structural reforms
would be essential for an economic turnaround in a low-inflation environment. However,
Directors cautioned that downside risks were significant. Potential political instability and
limited implementation capacity may undermine reform and stabilization efforts, weakening the
prospects for mobilizing donor financial support and attracting private capital inflows.
Directors underscored the importance of establishing fiscal discipline while ensuring the
delivery of essential public services. They were encouraged by the authorities’ intentions to
improve tax administration and review the tax regime to increase budget revenues. Directors
emphasized that the budgeted wage bill needs to be maintained and spending pressures from
parastatals to finance nonessential activities should be resisted to leave sufficient resources
for critical social needs and infrastructure. They also called for rapid progress in strengthening
the public financial management system. Given the sizable unfilled financing gap and the
necessity to cover critical humanitarian expenses, Directors encouraged the authorities to
intensify their efforts to establish workable budget aid delivery mechanisms in close
cooperation with the donor community. Directors noted that Zimbabwe is in debt distress and
large financing gaps would persist over the medium term even if policies were improved.
Given the circumstances, Directors supported the authorities’ decision to anchor inflation
expectations by introducing a multi-currency system with the rand as the reference currency.
They also emphasized that a significant strengthening of governance and transparency,
including through an independent audit, at the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe is urgently needed
to enhance the credibility and durability of recent macroeconomic policies. Directors concurred
that reintroduction of the national currency should await the establishment of a credible
institutional framework that would underpin central bank operations with a focus on price
stability.
Directors noted that banking system issues need to be addressed to improve payment
services and access to credit. They underscored that the payments system, banking
supervision, and liquidity management would need to be attuned to the requirements of the
multi-currency monetary framework.
Directors underscored that the revival of the economy depends critically on quickly attracting
private domestic and foreign investors and improving competitiveness. It is essential that the
government ensures the protection of property rights, maintains the rule of law, guards against
protectionism, and pursues prudent wage and income policies. Directors emphasized that
recent commendable efforts to liberalize prices and exchange restrictions for current account
transactions needed to be sustained. They also stressed the importance of improving the
quality and timeliness of data.
Directors observed that a track record of sound policy implementation, supported by targeted
technical assistance, including related statistics, from the Fund and other international financial

4
institutions, is a critical first step to securing donor financial support for the reconstruction of
Zimbabwe’s economy and regularizing its arrears to official creditors.

Statement by Samuel Itam, Executive Director for Zimbabwe
May 4, 2009
Introduction
1.
The Zimbabwean authorities appreciate the encouragement and support of the Fund.
They thank staff for their constructive dialogue during the 2009 Article IV consultation and
for the lucid set of reports, and broadly agree with the analyses and recommendations.
Background
2.
In the ten years prior to the emergence of a government of national unity in February
2009, economic and social conditions in Zimbabwe deteriorated significantly and reached
crisis proportions. In that period, GDP growth declined by about 40 percent; unprecedented
hyperinflation, fueled largely by excessive money growth, resulted in macroeconomic
instability and the demise of the national currency; and the debt position became very
precarious, with external debt estimated at US$6 billion (189 percent of GDP) at end-2008.
The central government’s spending capacity collapsed in 2008 as economic decline and rapid
erosion of the real value of accrued tax liabilities contributed to a drastic drop in revenues. At
the same time, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe’s (RBZ’s) quasi-fiscal activities increased.
Furthermore, the tightening of price controls and exchange restrictions exacerbated the
deterioration in business climate, exacerbating the economic decline. These factors, coupled
with the collapse in the public sector capacity to provide basic services, accentuated
unemployment, poverty, and the incidence of infectious diseases.
Economic developments and policy responses by the new government
3.
Against the background of the economic and humanitarian crisis, the new
administration has rapidly taken several macroeconomic and supply-side policy actions in the
fiscal, monetary, financial, and structural areas aimed at maintaining low inflation, halting
and reversing the economic decline, and improving social conditions. These actions are
articulated in the Short-Term Emergency Recovery Program (STERP) of the new
administration. Specifically, macroeconomic stability is to be restored and inflation contained
through strict fiscal discipline and appropriate monetary policy.

2
Fiscal policy
4.
The authorities have made considerable progress in implementing prudent fiscal
policy. They introduced a cash budgeting system in 2009. In order to implement the cash
budgeting system realistically while addressing critical social needs, the authorities have
revised the 2009 budget and have targeted a balanced fiscal position. They project hard
currency revenue to increase to US$ 1 billion in 2009 (29 percent of GDP). In this regard,
they are stepping up the collection of customs and excise duties as well as value-added tax
(VAT), which are expected to account for 60 percent of budget revenue. Expenditure is also
budgeted at US$ 1 billion, representing a cut of 15 percentage points of GDP relative to the
2008 outturn. As a contingency plan in case of a shortfall in revenue, the authorities will
consider measures to raise additional revenue in July 2009--including increasing royalties on
mineral resources and broadening the VAT and customs tax bases--to ensure the provision of
critical public services (including food relief, education and health).
5.
The authorities are under intense political pressure to increase public sector wages,
cognizant that maintaining the current flat civil service allowance of US$ 100 per month
would weaken morale. However, any reasonable pay raise may lead to an unaffordable
increase in the wage bill. Thus, the authorities and staff, agree that some decompression of
the wage scale would be justified in 2009 to improve motivation and retention of skilled civil
servants. This should be preceded by a payroll audit to remove “ghost workers”. Regarding
any unfilled financing gap in 2009, the government is vigorously seeking donor financing
support to help forestall the prospect of drastically reducing expenditures on social programs
and incurring payments arrears that could worsen economic and social conditions.
Monetary policy
6.
The new administration’s timely adoption of the use of hard currencies (especially the
US dollar and the South African Rand), with the Rand as the reference currency, has assisted
Zimbabwe in addressing the acute problem of hyperinflation. In addition, the abolition of
exchange controls and liberalization of trade and payments (for all transactions in foreign
currency) is helping to restore confidence. Furthermore, the RBZ has been directed to stop
quasi-fiscal activities, which hitherto included subsidized direct lending and allocation of
foreign exchange, below-cost provision of equipment and fertilizers to farmers, and transfers
to parastatals. The expenses arising from the quasi-fiscal activities were mainly financed by
surrender requirements on export proceeds, the retention of foreign exchange earnings of the
gold and agricultural sectors in excess of mandatory surrender requirements, the confiscation
of most foreign exchange deposits, external borrowing, and purchases of foreign exchange at
the parallel market exchange rate. These unconventional practices have also been abolished.
7.
The authorities have agreed with the staff recommendation to urgently enable the
domestic payments system to process payments in foreign exchange and attune banking
system supervision to the needs of the multi-currency system. In addition, ways to improve
liquidity management in the new multi-currency system, including through limited
lender-of-last-resort operations, are being examined. Also, the authorities are considering
measures for strengthening the RBZ’s governance and accountability framework, including

3
the appointment of five non-Executive Board members. The authorities plan to explore the
merits of possible re-introduction of a national currency at end-2009, taking into account all
requisite conditions.
Structural reforms to enhance growth and competitiveness
8.
The authorities have been pressing ahead with structural reforms since the inception
of the new government. Reforms in this area include price liberalization, discontinuation of
the foreign exchange surrender requirements and restrictions, abolition of the Grain
Marketing Board, and imposition of hard budget constraints on parastatal enterprises. The
government is seeking technical advice from the World Bank on other aspects of the reform
agenda, including privatization.
The STERP recognizes the urgency of dealing with the general concern regarding property
rights and the rule of law. However, staff call for drafting, adopting and implementing
necessary legislative acts to deal with these governance issues needs to bear in mind that
enacting such legislations requires strong political consensus among the coalition partners.
The government intends to continue working hard on confidence boosting measures to elicit
the necessary political consensus in the period ahead.
Challenges and risks ahead
9.
Notwithstanding the laudable policy and reform measures already taken by the
authorities to improve economic and social conditions, there remain many challenges and
risks. The authorities are, however, unwavering in their commitment to devote all efforts and
available resources to address the challenges and mitigate the risks-- which include possible
strain in political cohesion; shortfalls in budget revenue and foreign financing; issues related
to wage, productivity, employment and competitiveness; capacity constraint; data limitations;
debt burden; and, importantly, normalization of relations with the Fund.
10.
However, these challenges and risks are not insurmountable. Indeed, the authorities
have addressed several of them through a series of policy actions and reforms, while
remaining strongly committed to finding appropriate solutions to the others. But for complete
success, the authorities are counting on firm support from the Fund, other IFIs and
development partners to complement their efforts. As staff indicated, “economic turnaround
would not be possible without foreign assistance and private capital flows, even assuming
sound policy implementation”. The authorities are, therefore, looking forward to the Fund
being favorably disposed to their request for targeted provision of TA in the critical areas
highlighted in the “Proposed Decision”. It stands to reason that no meaningful economic
analysis and decision-making can take place, especially in the fiscal and monetary-financial
areas, without properly collated, reliable and timely data. Going forward, therefore, the
provision of Fund TA to strengthen statistics should be an integral component of the TA
package which should not require a formal listing or ‘Decision’.
11.
The authorities acknowledge, with appreciation, policy advice by the World Bank.
They thank the governments and peoples of Botswana, the Republic of South Africa and

4
other members of SADC for commitments of financial support, which demonstrate the
region’s aspiration to see Zimbabwe’s economy recover quickly. At the same time, the
authorities call on other IFIs and donors to come to the aid of Zimbabwe at this critical
juncture when the emergence of a new administration has created an opening for consultation
and cooperation. Zimbabwe stands ready to strengthen its cooperation with the Fund and
other relevant partners by continuing to build and establish a credible record of strong policy
implementation to ensure macroeconomic stability, entrench reforms, collaborate on debt
sustainability work, and meet financial obligations to the Fund and other creditors under
mutually agreed terms. The authorities look forward to Zimbabwe’s full integration into the
Fund, with all rights restored in the not too distant future.
Conclusion
12.
The authorities have established an encouraging record of economic policy
implementation and reform during the short period of the new government’s existence. They
are committed to continued implementation of necessary policies and structural reforms to
maintain macroeconomic stability essential for reversing the deterioration in economic
conditions and tackling poverty. They value the Fund’s policy advice and engagement, and
look forward to continued strong support for the country by the international community,
including the Fund. This new approach reflects the desire of Zimbabwe to cooperate fully.
