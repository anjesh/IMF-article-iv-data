REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA
Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2009 Consultation with
The Republic of Lithuania
Approved by Anne-Marie Gulde and Tessa van der Willigen
July 23, 2009
Discussions: Vilnius, June 11–23, 2009. The mission (C. Purfield (Head), J. Vacher, J. Miniane,
A. Kangur (all EUR), E. Cerutti (SPR), L. Cortavarria-Checkley, D. Parker (MCM), and
N. Budina (FAD)) met Prime Minister Kubilius; Finance Minister Šemeta; Bank of Lithuania
Governor Šarkinas; Minister of Economy Kreivys; other high level officials, parliamentarians, and
representatives of the private sector. Mr. Abazorius (OED) also joined the discussions. The mission
concluded with a press conference.
Previous consultations: The risks associated with large external imbalances and reliance on capital
inflows under the Currency Board Arrangement (CBA) were highlighted by earlier Article IV
Consultations. The expansionary stance of fiscal policy in 2008 was in contrast to the tightening
planned and additional consolidation recommended by Directors to build a fiscal cushion. Now that
the hard-landing has materialized, this expansionary stance largely precludes the scope for the
counter-cyclical fiscal policy advocated in the previous Consultation. More recent steps to remove
VAT exemptions and cut current spending were in line with Fund recommendations. Consistent with
the 2008 FSAP Update, the Bank of Lithuania (BOL) updated its lender of last resort procedures and
strengthened its contingency planning framework. It also required banks’ to retain 2008 profits to
bolster capital.
2009 policy advice: The discussions focused on the immediate impact of the global crisis on
Lithuania and policies needed to ensure financial, fiscal, and external sustainability, address risks,
pave the way for a healthy recovery and secure speedy euro adoption. Staff advocated a sizeable
fiscal consolidation to ensure that public debt is sustainable, augmentation of banks’ capital buffers to
address prospective losses with complementary efforts to enhance crisis prevention and contingency
frameworks, and further wage adjustment and structural reforms to support the currency board and
raise growth potential.
The authorities’ position: Keenly aware of the challenges ahead and adjustment required to support
the currency board, the new government in place since late-2008 emphasized its ongoing efforts
aimed at a substantial fiscal adjustment—which carries the support of Parliament and social partners
at large—a strengthening of the financial system, and an overhaul of business and labor regulations to
improve the investment climate, as key elements of its strategy to ensure the euro is adopted from a
position of strength.

I. STAFF APPRAISAL AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.
The economy grew rapidly over the past decade but the surge in capital inflows
post-EU accession generated significant risks that have now materialized. Between 1998
and 2008, real per capita incomes rose from about 40 percent to two-thirds of the EU average
reflecting the rebound from the 1998 crisis and rapidly rising productivity (Figure 1).
However, the capital inflows that followed EU accession were mostly channeled to the
non-tradable sector, stoking an asset and consumption boom that had its counterpart in
growing external indebtedness (Figure 2). Rapid wage growth began to erode
competitiveness while loose fiscal policy added to demand pressures (Figure 3).
2.
The Lithuanian economy is now undergoing a painful adjustment. The reversal in
capital flows in the wake of the global financial crisis has triggered a hard landing starting in
late 2008. The downturn in domestic activity–by far the most severe since Independence—is
also being compounded by the global economic contraction.
3.
The sizable adjustment in policies since the onset of the downturn will have to
continue. The original and May supplementary budgets implemented substantial fiscal
adjustment, and timely measures have been taken to stabilize the financial system. However,
the fiscal adjustment roughly offsets the impact of past expansionary policies and more is
needed to underpin the credibility of the CBA and the strategy of rapid euro adoption going
forward. A clearly articulated plan that outlines the multi-year reform strategy will be key to
galvanize public support for the still substantial adjustment ahead.
4.

Fiscal consolidation should be guided by the need to:


sustainably bring spending to more affordable levels, primarily through savings in
social benefits and public sector wage bill which have grown at an unsustainable pace in
recent years;

broaden the tax base, improve compliance, and raise some tax rates, including
personal income tax and VAT rates;

strengthen fiscal institutions including frameworks for monitoring fiscal
developments and setting rules to enhance fiscal discipline;

protect the most vulnerable including through rationalization of generous benefit
programs.
5.
Efforts to enhance soundness of the banking system and crisis preparedness
must continue including through:
Accelerating loan loss provisioning and raising banks’ capital, seeking more explicit
commitments from parent banks to pledge the necessary liquidity and capital support to their


4
subsidiaries, and increasing surveillance particularly of banks with shorter-term and high cost
funding profiles;
Augmenting contingency planning frameworks through enhanced communication and
drill exercises; and



Expanding the tool kit to deal with potential bank difficulties by allowing alternatives
to its full acquisition by the government, such as a bridge bank, to help protect the taxpayer
from potential hidden losses or contingencies.



6.
The crisis only underscores the imperative for structural reforms to improve
longer-term growth prospects where risks to the outlook are on the downside. Private
sector wages have shown flexibility but steps to improve the business environment including
reducing administrative burdens in business planning, land regulation, and public
procurement could help attract FDI.
7.
Despite the ongoing adjustment and the fact that the currency board has acted
as a useful anchor, there are risks. The CBA places the burden of adjustment squarely on
domestic policies. Further substantial fiscal consolidation is needed to secure euro adoption,
which may prove challenging. Moreover, the large fiscal contraction could exacerbate the
downturn and in turn increase the size of the needed adjustment, all compounded in a context
of price deflation and deleveraging of the economy. Adverse shocks could, given the limited
excess international reserves, add to risks. Finally, while wages in the private sector are
adjusting, production costs will need to come down further for a switch to a more
tradeables-based economy to be achieved and to improve growth prospects.
8.
The authorities broadly shared staff’s diagnosis of the challenges ahead but
emphasized the strong adjustment being implemented to safeguard macroeconomic
stability. They underscored the importance of maintaining the currency board as the key
anchor for external and domestic stability, particularly in the current difficult economic
environment, and pointed to the strong adjustment in private and public sectors underway
that support it. They see fiscal consolidation as necessary to complement the adjustment in
the private sector and underpin the CBA and euro adoption strategy. They stressed the size
and quality of fiscal measures already taken in 2009 and emphasized that their medium-term
consolidation is to be driven by structural reforms. While acknowledging the usefulness of
building preemptive capital buffers in the banking system, they noted the steps already taken
to intensify oversight of banks, the relatively high capital adequacy ratio, the sizable role of
foreign banks in the system, and the results of recent stress tests as also providing assurances
that the deterioration in asset quality over the downturn is manageable. The also pointed to
other measures taken to strengthen contingency planning frameworks including the increase
in deposit insurance as well as a new law that strengthens the bank resolution framework.

5
II. OUTLOOK AND KEY CHALLENGES
9.
A long and painful recession is underway (Tables 1–3, Figures 4–6). The reversal
in capital inflows has come at the cost of a domestic downturn that ranks amongst the most
severe in the region. Quarterly GDP was 12 percent lower in 2009 Q1 than in 2008 Q2
(peak), and although lead indicators show tentative signs of bottoming out they remain very
weak. Real GDP is forecast to decline by 16 percent in 2009 and 3¾ percent in 2010 driven
by the contraction in domestic demand. Associated with this, unemployment is likely to
average 16½ percent in 2010, up from 6 percent in 2008. The end-2009 closure of the
Ignalina nuclear power plant contributes to the continued contraction in 2010.1

10.
In this context, staff expect strong deflation. Core consumer prices—which account
for just over half of total CPI—are expected to fall by a cumulative 20 percentage points
over 2009–10. This is consistent with ongoing sharp

Ignalina’s closure is expected to reduce the GDP level by about 0.8 percent, and increase imports by about
0.5–1 percent of GDP.
2

For instance, between August 1998 and February 2004, the deflation process in Hong Kong saw core prices
fall by a cumulative 20 percent. The long period of decline reflected the impact of three “successive” shocks—
the Asian crisis, the global IT bust, and SARS—but it also points to the risk that deflation in Lithuania could be
longer lasting than expected in the baseline.

6
11.
In the medium term, staff see a slow return to a more sustainable pace of
growth. A recovery is expected to take

sector— the destruction of potentially
viable firms in the downturn, and the negative impact of Ignalina’s closure. As such,
potential growth could decline by at least 1½–2 percentage points relative to its peak of
6 percent in 2004–06. All in all, potential output is expected to be around 15 percent lower
by 2014 than it would have been absent the crisis, a larger loss in potential than experienced
during the Asian crisis, including in Indonesia.
12.
Uncertainty around these medium-term forecasts is unusually large, but risks
are on the downside. Forecasting medium-term headline and potential growth in a context
of double digit contraction is fraught with difficulties. The outlook could also prove worse
than staff’s baseline: (i) the global recovery could be delayed, (ii) factor costs still have a
ways to adjust to fully regain competitiveness, and (iii) resolving the debt overhang in a
deflationary context may take longer than expected, with the banking system impaired by
rising non-performing loans (NPLs) acting as a drag on growth. If downside risks to
medium-term growth were to materialize, other elements of the baseline such as the fiscal
path would naturally be affected.
13.
Against the backdrop of a sizeable economic contraction, the current account is
expected to be in a temporary surplus (Table 4). The current account is forecast to be in
surplus in 2009 (0.6 percent of GDP) as the reduction in imports (about 36 percent) outpaces
that of exports (about 26 percent). Over the medium-term, the current account is expected to
revert to a deficit as the economy recovers and electricity-related imports to replace
Ignalina’s output rise. However, the forecast 9 percent improvement in the real effective
exchange rate over the projection period, together with the economic recovery in trade
partners, contributes to gradually increasing export volumes. Inflows are likely to remain at

7
lower levels than the recent past which would help stabilize external debt after 2011
(Annex 1).
14.
However, the economy is left with significant debt and subject to a funding
contraction (Box 1). External liabilities are not being fully rolled over. Net private capital
outflows are forecast to reach 12 percent of GDP in 2009 reflecting declines in trade credit
and rollover rates of 80 percent in banks (85 percent in foreign banks) and 75 percent in the
corporate sector. 3 These outflows are partly mitigated by capital inflows to the public sector
reflecting the front-loading of EU structural funds, and the increase in EIB and eurobond
funding. Capital injections by foreign banks into

The capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of
13.9 percent is above the 8 percent regulatory

8.2 percent, with the overdue but not impaired
component increasing at a much faster rate.4 Loan

The economy is consequently in the midst
of a credit contraction reflecting deteriorating
asset quality, as well as lower funding and credit
demand.

The stock of funding from parent banks has declined by 6 percent in 2009 H1.

Although real estate prices have fallen by an estimated 20 percent since 2008 (Vilnius), NPLs constitute about
3.2 percent of household mortgages. Corporates loans represent about 70 percent of the total NPL stock.

8
Capital buffers are likely to thin as the recession proceeds, already evidenced by negative
profitability in 2009 Q1.5

Liquidity risk requires close monitoring. In October 2008, a deposit run drained
6½ percent of total deposits. While liquidity has since stabilized, deposits have shifted
increasingly into foreign currencies (FX deposits account for about 31 of deposits compared
to about 25 percent at end-2008). Funding and access to contingent sources in case of deposit
stress remains a challenge. Parent bank funding of subsidiaries has declined, while domestic
banks face pressure from the interbank market— where maturities have shortened, funding
has decreased, and rates have increased sharply— as well as increased competition for
deposits. Moreover, nonresident deposits, which represent a modest 7 percent of deposits of
the system have contracted sharply by 41 percent since end 2007 as the economic situation
deteriorated in neighboring countries.
16.
The BoL has reacted swiftly to these challenges. Since October 2008 it reduced
reserve requirements from 6 to 4 percent to help ease liquidity pressures, and has
implemented 2008 FSAP Update recommendations to improve internal guidelines for lender
of last resort operations (LoLR) and collateral valuation procedures, while monitoring daily
bank-by-bank deposits and liquidity positions. The deposit insurance limit was raised to
€100,000 and bank resolution tools are also being enhanced through the draft Financial
Stability Law in Parliament. The new framework provides for government guarantees of
interbank lending (Litas 3 billion, 3.4 percent of GDP), and public support for bank
recapitalization and asset purchases. The government has also established a financial crisis
preparedness committee to enhance coordination and contingency planning.
17.
Government finances are also under considerable strain reflecting the legacy of
the sizable structural deficit amassed in the boom (Tables 6–7):

The cyclically adjusted deficit had risen to 6½ percent of GDP by end-2008, a near
threefold increase from 2006.6 This reflected generous wage and social benefit increases,
which grew in real terms by nearly 13 and 50 percent, respectively, between 2006–08.

The headline central government fiscal deficit widened to 4.6 percent of staff’s
full-year GDP estimate by end-May 2009 as tax revenues contracted by 28 percent (y/y).
Indirect taxes have come under particular pressure from cross-border shopping—notably for
food products and diesel—as neighboring countries’ currencies have depreciated. Budget
financing, particularly domestic financing in the t-bill market, has become more short-term
5

In 1995, NPLs peaked at 32 percent, albeit in the context of a systemic bank crisis and with different measures
of asset quality and growth outlook.

Table 7 presents a range of cyclically-adjusted estimates given the uncertainty surrounding output gap
estimates in the current context and the likely structural break in tax compliance in a recession.

and private placements have become more common, with borrowing costs rising to an
average 7–9 percent, as sovereign debt ratings, although still investment grade, have been
gradually downgraded. The general government debt burden has risen from very low levels
to 23 percent of GDP.
18.
The authorities have responded proactively to contain the deterioration in the
fiscal deficit. The original and May 2009 supplementary budgets implemented a sizeable
adjustment of 7.3 percent of GDP. The consolidation being realized is largely
expenditure-based—in line with international experience from successful fiscal adjustments
(Occasional Paper No. 246) and reflecting the surge in the expenditure-to-GDP ratio in the
recent past. Current spending allocations were adjusted downward given the backdrop of
deflation, investment was protected by utilizing front-loaded EU funds to replace
domestically funded-capital projects that would otherwise been shelved, and wage cuts were
targeted at higher-paid civil servants. The adjustment has also permanently raised various tax
rates and broadened the VAT base to protect the revenue base. The package also included a
temporary and less desirable reduction in transfers to the second pension pillar and the cut in
the personal income tax rates added to revenue pressures although it helped garner support
for the adjustment. European Investment Bank (EIB) financing and the successful
June €500 million eurobond issue helped alleviate immediate fiscal financing needs, lessened
reliance on domestic financing sources, and reopened access to international capital markets.7

The eurobond was issued at a coupon of 9.375 percent and 5-year maturity.

Risks to the outlook going forward are to the downside. The ongoing contraction
and related deflation, risks in the financial system, and public finances could negatively
reinforce each other more than envisioned. Global deleveraging could accelerate the decline
in parent bank funding and exacerbate the credit crunch. External shocks could also trigger
confidence problems in the banking system and pressures on the CBA through contagion

11
effects.8 Looking beyond the crisis, a slower than expected recovery in key trading partners
such as Russia, Latvia, and Ukraine could also delay exit from the recession.
20.
Excess external reserves buffers to address tail risks are relatively low. By
end-May 2009, international reserves were down about 8 percent from end-2008 causing
reserve money to shrink by roughly the same amount and domestic interest rates to rise
considerably. They cover only 3 months of imports and about 46 percent of short-term debt
(remaining maturity). Excess reserves (foreign reserves above the monetary base) that are
available for lending to commercial banks are sufficient to cover about 4 percent of total
deposits or 16 percent of domestic banks’ deposits.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
21.
The authorities see maintaining the CBA as critical to external and
macroeconomic stability, as well as to Lithuania’s aspirations to adopt the euro. Not
only has the currency board been a confidence anchor—including in the episode of stress that
followed the 1998 ruble crisis—the authorities view it as an indispensable element in their
strategy of securing a rapid and orderly exit from the peg via euro adoption. Given the
objective of complying with the Maastricht convergence criterion by 2011 to qualify for euro
adoption by 2013 and the challenges the crisis has presented, discussions focused on short
and medium-term policies needed to safeguard external and domestic stability under the
CBA, as well as the associated risks to the strategy.
22.
The magnitude of the external shock has underlined the need to restore
competitiveness, with the CBA placing the burden of adjustment firmly on domestic
policies. Removing the real exchange rate overvaluation will require reducing production
factors’ costs relative to those of trading partners (Box 2), many of which have recently
gained competitiveness through nominal depreciation. Staff’s average estimate suggests the
real effective exchange rate is moderately overvalued. However, engineering this factor price
reduction will be challenging. The CBA precludes the use of monetary and interest rate
policy to mitigate the downturn and places the burden of adjustment on fiscal policy—which
risks aggravating the downturn—and on domestic demand in general.
23.
The authorities are fully cognizant of these trade offs and are strongly
committed to the peg as a nominal anchor and the policies needed to sustain it. The
maintenance of the currency board is seen as the key anchor for external and domestic
stability, particularly in the current difficult economic environment. They noted that the large
declines seen in private sector wages should help improve competitiveness. They also
stressed that recent fiscal consolidation testifies to their will and ability to implement the

boards.

12
necessary policies, while reductions in public sector wages will complement the private
sector-led adjustment. This, combined with ongoing structural reforms to improve the
business environment, could enhance Lithuania’s potential growth prospects as a full
member of the eurozone.
24.
Conversely, the authorities believe that a devaluation would exacerbate the
contraction while delivering limited gains. Imported intermediate goods account for over
60 percent of total costs in several of Lithuania's key exports (e.g. refined oil products or
fertilizers) while labor and other non-tradeables account for around a third or less. Moreover,
at this juncture of the economic downturn—with Lithuania’s main export partners in
recession—a devaluation would unlikely promote rapid export growth. In the authorities’
view, a devaluation would risk severe disruption in the banking system and the loss of
credibility from abandoning the currency board would be followed by downgrades of credit
ratings, the freezing of access to international financial markets, and would jettison
Lithuania’s ambition to adopt the euro. Corporate and household debt burdens would rise
quickly with a devaluation, overwhelming existing debt restructuring mechanisms and
risking defaults among exporters and non-exporters, with negative feedback loops on asset
prices and banks’ balance sheets. Staff agreed that the net impact of a devaluation is unclear.
Staff also underscored that the decision to maintain the CBA imposed constraints and
challenges.
25.
The authorities agreed that addressing the challenges within the CBA going
forward will require sustaining the remarkable adjustment of recent months including
through:

A further sizeable consolidation in the fiscal sector to ensure debt sustainability and
timely qualification for euro adoption;

The building of additional buffers in the financial system to address liquidity and
credit risk; and

Further wage adjustment and structural reforms to re-orientate output towards
tradable sectors helping to improve medium-term growth prospects.
A. Securing Fiscal Sustainability
26.
The authorities see reducing the large structural deficit and securing fiscal
sustainability as a key imperative. The general government deficit would have risen to
17 percent of GDP in 2009, if the impact of 2008 policies had not been unwound through the
adjustment undertaken through May 2009. This adjustment places the estimated 2009
headline deficit at about 9.7 percent of GDP (½ percentage point higher if net of pillar II
transfer cuts) and has helped contain the deterioration in the cyclically-adjusted deficit.
However, under unchanged policies, the 2010 deficit would rise to 13 percent of GDP. To
help reduce the 2009 and 2010 deficit further, a second supplementary budget was submitted

13
to Parliament in June targeting further reductions in spending and increase in tax rates
effective from August 2009. Parliamentary debate on this package is ongoing.
27.
The authorities’ objective of targeting ambitious upfront fiscal adjustment is
appropriate.

ability to finance wider deficits

14
If approved, these measures would yield ¾ percent of GDP in 2009 (1¾ percent of GDP
annualized), helping contain the 2009 budget deficit to about 9 percent of GDP (9½ percent
net of pillar II transfer cuts), a level that should be financeable, and would reduce the
structural deficit to 6½–7½ percent of GDP (Table 7).
29.
Staff agreed that additional sizeable fiscal consolidation would still be needed in
2010–11 to safeguard debt sustainability and underpin the euro-adoption. In 2010, even
including the impact of the June 2009 supplementary budget measures, the fiscal deficit
could rise to 11.2 percent of GDP (½ percent greater net of pillar II transfer cuts) due to the
continued fall in GDP, with the Ministry of Finance’s working estimates of the fiscal deficit
broadly in the same range. This implies additional fiscal consolidation of about 7 percent of
GDP in 2010/11 is needed to achieve the authorities’ deficit target of 3 percent of GDP
in 2011, the target date set recently under the EU excessive deficit procedure. This would
stabilize the debt burden at a more sustainable 40 percent of GDP (Annex 1), and secure
compliance with the Maastricht debt criterion. However even with the adjustment, the
anticipated 2010 deficit may still require significant financing.
30.
Staff shared the authorities’ view that the adjustment should be anchored in
structural reforms to reduce expenditures that are unsustainably high. The authorities’
plans—drawing on the recent World Bank Public Expenditure Review—for a comprehensive
reform to be implemented with the 2010 budget are welcome. The scope for savings appear
to be greatest in social benefits (Box 4) and civil service pay which combined account for
two-thirds of spending. To bring benefits in line with contributions and restore full funding
of the second pension pillar, reforms should seek to gradually raise the retirement age,
remove the scope for discretionary increases for the formulae for basic and contributory
pensions, tighten eligibility for child, disability and sickness benefits, and decrease the term
of maternity benefits to international levels. Reform of civil service pay structures could
yield substantial savings: the public-private pay differential, inclusive of bonuses, was
40 percent in 2008. There is also scope for savings in the education sector where an aging
population has left Lithuania with a very low student-teacher ratio.
31.
Given the magnitude of the adjustment it would also be prudent to raise the
tax-to-GDP ratio, including by broadening the base, strengthening administration, and
raising tax rates. Steps to broaden the tax base, including via real estate and motor vehicle
taxation, are under consideration, and the authorities are receiving IMF technical assistance
to bolster tax administration. Staff suggested a comprehensive review of the tax system to
improve its efficiency and to streamline tax incentives. It may also be necessary to raise tax
rates, and in addition to the VAT rate increases already in-train, consideration should also be
given to reversing the recent PIT rate reduction. However, the authorities prefer to increase
the social contribution rate as this would directly improve SoDra’s finances.
32.
There is also scope to strengthen fiscal institutions and promote fiscal discipline.
Fiscal risks stemming from government guarantees associated with the business stimulus

15
package, PPPs, or the Financial Stability Law should be closely monitored, managed, and
integrated into fiscal policy analysis. The fiscal framework needs to be revamped to avoid
pro-cyclicality, promote discipline and savings in good times, and ultimately create a greater
cushion for future downturns. The authorities are formulating reforms to ground the annual
budgets in a multi-year framework and targets in cyclically-adjusted terms.
33.
In the context of such a large scale economic adjustment, it will be important but
challenging to provide space for social safety nets. The World Bank recommendations to
extend the term of unemployment benefits and broaden the coverage of the existing
well-targeted social assistance programs could be accommodated through the rationalization
of overly generous contributory benefit schemes.
B. Safeguarding Banking System Soundness
34.
The authorities acknowledge the risks in the financial sector but see them as
manageable. The large presence of foreign owned banks is viewed as a stabilizing factor,
with parent banks and home countries expected to provide continuous support to their
Lithuanian operations. In that context, the decrease in parent bank funding is largely viewed
as a response to the lack of lending opportunities and credit demand. Recent stress tests
indicated that under a baseline scenario banks may need to raise between ¼ and 2.4 percent
of GDP by the end of 2010 to cover expected to unexpected losses.9 Stress tests conducted at
the Sveriges Riksbank suggest that Swedish banks, which constitute 60 percent of banks’
assets in Lithuania, could withstand large shocks to their capital from 10 percent per year
loan losses related to their exposure in the Baltic States.10 The authorities saw the results of
these tests as indications that risks to the financial sector are manageable.
35.
The BoL has taken steps to increase capital buffers in the banking system. For
example, it requested banks to capitalize their full 2008 profits. Additionally, it conducts
well-targeted on site examinations to ensure the timely build-up of loan loss provisioning.
Precautionary measures are also being adopted to ensure the safety and soundness of the
banking system: temporary protection of depositors up to €100,000 is being made permanent,
in line with EU guidelines.
36.
However, additional action is needed to ensure that financial institutions remain
solvent and well-capitalized to cope with the contraction in economic activity. Staff see
the ongoing downturn as potentially having more serious effects on banks’ capital needs than
9

BoL stress tests were conducted on the five largest banks representing 76 percent of the loan portfolio and
84 percent of deposits. Shocks included a further large fall in real estate prices, an increase in interest rates and
unemployment. Liquidity stress tests were carried out on 9 banks and 6 foreign bank branches and differed
depending on parent bank reactions (See http://www.lb.lt/eng/publications/index.html).

Sveriges Riksbank, Financial Stability Report 2009.

16
quantified by recent stress tests given the risk of further rises in unemployment, the difficulty
in estimating the impact of rising interest rates on asset quality, and challenges in estimating
bank specific probabilities of default. Therefore to ensure that banks remain solvent and
problem banks are quickly resolved, staff encouraged:

Accelerated loan loss provisioning, full semi-annual audits, and preemptive increases
in bank capital based on enhanced stress tests exercises.

Securing explicit commitments from parent banks to pledge the necessary liquidity
and capital support to their subsidiaries. The authorities have already received general
commitments from parent banks and are coordinating with other supervisors in the region,
but it may be useful to coordinate commitments of parent banks and that of their respective
supervisors across the Baltics to ensure the equitable sharing of the deleveraging burden
going forward.

The running of liquidity stress tests on a consolidated basis to ensure that the risk of
contamination arising from problems in subsidiaries of Lithuanian banks abroad is properly
factored in, and that more pessimistic scenarios are devised to test tail risks.

Further enhancement of the crisis preparedness regime, including drill crisis exercises
to strengthen potential weak areas with respect to triggers and coordinating procedures.

Incorporating in the draft Financial Stability Law additional measures to protect the
State from contingent or hidden losses in case it needs to take over a bank. Since the draft
law only permits bank recapitalization through the acquisition of bank shares, there is a risk
that shareholders may benefit from public assistance. Putting a bank into receivership and
performing a “bridge” bank purchase and assumption option would help to mitigate such
risks and provide flexibility to cover depositors and perhaps other creditors.

Ensuring implementing regulations of the draft Financial Stability Law are ready for
immediate passage. The regulations should seek to clarify the procedures for: (i) valuing
bank shares; (ii) acquiring assets from banks in a transparent manner creating a proper
vehicle for their management; and (iii) specifying the agency responsible for securing and
inventorying a problem-bank’s assets and preparing final financial statements in the event of
closure.

Enhanced supervision of banks with shorter and significantly costlier funding profiles
to safeguard the deposit insurance scheme.

Proposals to overhaul the supervisory framework and merge financial supervisory
agencies are premature given the already demanding agenda.
37.
The authorities welcomed these recommendations but saw challenges in
implementing some of them. They noted that banks are being asked to raise capital, hold the

17
distribution of retained earnings, and to determine loan provisioning based on International
Financial Reporting Standards. They also noted that their existing stress tests encompass
pessimistic scenarios of liquidity and credit risk and that their participation in the
IMF-coordinated stress test of banking systems in Central and South East Europe should help
lend confidence to their findings. The authorities expressed particular interest in exploring
the feasibility of allowing for a bridge bank option under the bank resolution framework,
although legal opinion was divided if such an option is consistent with the Constitution.
38.
Speedy corporate and household debt restructuring will also be key to the
recovery. While the legal framework for debt restructuring is generally in line with
international standards, it will be tested by the downturn. Voluntary agreements between
banks and their customers should remain the preferred route to ensure effective debt work
outs. Following the experience in resolving bankruptcies over the coming months, a general
review of the bankruptcy framework could then be undertaken to examine the need and scope
to enhance the legal framework by including inter alia the approval of pre-packaged
restructuring plans by a qualified majority of creditors, the assignment of priority repayment
status to creditors providing new financing during the restructuring, the introduction of
mechanisms to protect the interests of secured creditors, and the swift conversion of
bankruptcy into restructuring proceedings to the extent that firms are still viable. To deal
with the increased workload, expedited training programs in commercial issues could better
equip the judiciary. The authorities concurred with the need to closely monitor how current
corporate and household debt restructuring processes fare in the months ahead to determine
the need for changes in the legal framework.
C. Enhancing Longer-Term Growth Potential
39.
Adjusting costs will be important to regain competitiveness. Lithuania has a high
degree of wage flexibility: it has one of the highest shares of intra-firm wage bargaining—
and less collective bargaining—and one of the highest frequencies of changes in base wages
in the EU.11 Real private sector gross earnings are falling quickly: wage costs in the
construction sector are down by 20 percent (3-month percent change, annualized) as
of May 2009.

11

ECB Monetary bulletin, February 2009.

18
Beyond labor costs, improvements to the business environment are needed.
Notwithstanding the need to interpret Doing Business Indicators with caution, those suggest
Lithuania’s business environment ranks reasonably high—28th out of 181 countries—but it
lags in some key areas. Land regulations are strict and unpredictable and securing
construction permits can be an arduous process. Such bottlenecks may help explain why
Lithuania has been less successful than others in the region in attracting FDI, particularly to
tradable sectors.

The authorities are undertaking a wide range of structural reforms. Lithuania
has sought and received a substantial front loading of EU funds for infrastructure investment
and the promotion of small-and medium-sized enterprises and exporters. Full and effective
utilization of these funds, while challenging, is essential to offset the impact of the ongoing
reversal in private capital flows. Steps to reduce administrative burdens and bottlenecks in
business planning, land regulation, and public procurement recommended by the
government-sponsored “Sunrise Commission” on structural reform should facilitate
investment. Amendments to the Labor Code in Parliament, if approved, would enhance
flexibility in the areas of working hours or dismissal arrangements. The recent higher
education reform that seeks to increase competition between colleges and universities for
public funds is expected to spur research and development. Investments in energy efficiency,
supported by the EIB and EBRD, should reduce the impact of rising energy prices after
Ignalina’s closure.
41.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Box 1: Balance Sheet Exposures
The gross external debt burden in Lithuania rose sharply post EU-accession to 71.4 percent of GDP at
end-2008. External debt net of reserves represented about 57 percent of GDP. Lithuania’s external and
domestic debt remains below many Eastern European counterparts but is higher than that seen prior to
previous crisis elsewhere.

Driving the rise in indebtedness was the
ease of credit availability and perceived
absence of exchange rate risk. The stock
of credit rose rapidly to nearly 60 percent
of GDP by end-2008, from 26 percent in
2004, with foreign parent banks financing
around three-quarters of net new bank
lending in 2007–08. Most lending was
directed to non-tradable investment in real
estate and construction. Over 70 percent of
lending is FX denominated reflecting
widening interest differentials and
increased preference for euro borrowing.

1/ Gross external debt minus gross international reserves.

Gross non-financial private sector indebtedness rose sharply. Household debt reached almost 40 percent
of GDP by end-2008 up from about 8 percent in 2004. However, households held sizeable assets worth
almost 70 percent of GDP at end-2008. About half of household loans are mortgages, with foreign banks
instrumental in expanding the mortgage market, benefiting in particular from their availability of medium
term funding at low cost. Mortgage loans were granted–on aggregate–at reasonable loan-to-value ratios
(54 percent for new loans in Q1 2009, with the existing stock being estimated at 45 percent loan-to-value).
Moreover, only 11 percent of households, mainly in upper income brackets, hold mortgages. The stock of
loans held by the nonfinancial corporates also rose, albeit less rapidly, to 53 percent of GDP. Corporate and
household gross FX denominated debt is estimated at about 54 percent of GDP, while FX assets are
estimated at 9½ percent of GDP. Loans are predominantly in euro at variable interest rates, based on 3 to
6 months interbank rates, with households and corporates bearing most of the interest risk.

Box 2. Exchange Rate Assessment
The standard CGER procedures point towards a moderate overvaluation of the real exchange
rate, but estimations need to be interpreted with caution given the wide range of results and
uncertainty regarding key variables used in the calculations. Both the macroeconomic balance
approach (MB) and the external sustainability approach (ES), which measure the overvaluation of the
exchange rate as a function of the gap between the underlying current account—the current account
stripped of temporary factors—and the equilibrium current account—a balance that is consistent with
medium term fundamentals—are at the lower end of the overvaluation estimates, averaging from 2 to
7¼ percent as of December 2008.1 Nevertheless, in the current context of a severe recession, the
estimations used in both methods to calculate the underlying current account are very sensitive to the
estimated output gaps (of Lithuania and its trade partners) and/or to the medium term current account
projections. The equilibrium exchange rate (ERER) method avoids these problems by estimating
directly the equilibrium real exchange rate as a function of economic fundamentals.2 It estimates an
overvaluation of 26 percent, but the method is not free of significant problems (e.g. the proxy used for
accounting for differences in relative productivity is not accurate enough and lags) and likely
overestimates the disequilibrium in an economy undergoing rapid structural changes. An additional
approach that uses the average CPI-based and manufacturing ULC-based REER deviation from their
five year averages shows a 9 percent overvaluation.

to 11 percent.

Wage productivity differentials also suggest moderate overvaluation but the impact on export
market share and firms’ profitability has been limited. The real exchange rate using the unit wage
cost in the manufacturing sector as the deflator shows a rising trend increasing by 4 percent and
12 percent from 2007 and 2005 until July 2008. Unlike some other Eastern European countries,
Lithuania has experienced gains in export market shares at a worldwide level as well as among
European Union and CIS countries groups, even after discounting the recent increase in oil production
and exports. The profitability of firms in tradable sectors, such as manufacturing, only decreased in
2008 QIV as the global economy contracted.

The REER appreciation accelerated in 2009 due to the sharp nominal exchange rate
depreciation of non-pegged partner countries, but it has stabilized and started to reverse in
recent months. The speed of REER adjustment through prices and wages in Lithuania was overtaken
by the sharp nominal exchange rate adjustment of most floaters in 2009 and highlights the potential
vulnerability to large nominal exchange rate adjustments in a large group of trade partners.

The underlying current account is calculated by stripping out cyclical influences on the actual
current account in both approaches, plus adding the lagged impact of the past appreciation of the real
exchange rate appreciation in the elasticity-based approach, and an adjustment for expected fiscal
consolidation in the projection-based approach. Given the balancing of the current account, the ES
results do not change substantially if the December 2008 NFA or the projected 2014 NFA level is
used to determine the NFA-stabilizing balance. See Selected Issues, IMF Country Report No. 08/140

Box 3: Revenue Performance Post Boom
The abrupt end to the boom has major implications for tax revenue collections. High imports
boosted indirect tax receipts, and rising wages buoyed PIT and social security tax collections. Early
evidence from the adjustments in other Baltic countries, where the economic downturn preceded
Lithuania’s, suggest tax receipts will fall significantly in Lithuania because of:
Lower effective tax rates and a declining tax base: Effective VAT collections have fallen
substantially from their peak in Estonia and Latvia with about 1-2½ percent of GDP reflecting the
unwinding of windfall receipts from the boom. In Lithuania, because the increase in consumption
during the boom was not as pronounced as in the rest of the Baltics, regression analyses suggest an
underlying fall of about 1 percent of GDP could be expected, absent the increase in rates. Effective
corporate income tax (CIT) rates which previously exhibited steady increases reflecting earlier
build up of profit margins are also likely to fall. In the boom, revenue buoyancy facilitated cuts in
PIT rates. Now, as wages correct, Lithuania could lose between 0.6–0.8 percent of GDP in PIT
receipts.
Worsening tax compliance: Independent assessments indicate that the share of unpaid taxes to
total tax collection increased from about 1 percent in 2007 to just above 2 percent in the first
quarter of 2009, with about half attributable to VAT. There was some evidence of pre-existing
problems in administration. VAT arrears have been on a upward trend since 2007 and the C-ratio
(ratio of net VAT proceeds over the maximum collectible at the headline rate) of 70 percent in the
boom was well in excess of the EU average of 63 percent, boosted by unpaid VAT refunds (about
1 percent of GDP).

base pensions while the mandatory
retirement ages for men (62.5) and women
(60) remained below the OECD
average (65). Spending on sickness and maternity benefits rose from 1.0 percent of GDP in 2006 to
an estimated 2.2 percent in 2009. Spending on sickness benefits grew in real terms by 61 percent
between 2006–08, underpinned by strong wage growth and an increase in claimants due to lax
certification. Spending on maternity benefits more than doubled in real terms reflecting the extension
in leave to 2 years and an effective replacement rate in excess of 100 percent, making it one of the
most generous benefits in the EU.

corporates; 5 percent deposit outflows for nonresidents; and FDI (excluding bank recapitalizations) declining 75 percent. The 2010
projections assume rollover rates of 95 percent for foreign banks, 75 percent for domestic banks, and 85 percent for corporates; 5
percent deposit outflows for nonresidents; and FDI (excluding bank recapitalizations) declining 75 percent with respect to 2008.

Source: Bank of Lithuania.
1/ Without foreign bank branches.
2/ Capital is the item in banks balance sheet under Shareholders' Equity and Foreign Bank Branches Funds Received from the Head Office (the latter untill end-2007).
3/ From end-2005 FSI is Nonperforming loans to capital.
4/ Net income before taxes.
5/ Large exposure - means loans granted to the borrower the net value of which equals to, or exceeds, 10 per cent of bank capital that is
calculated having regard to the national Rules for Calculating Capital Adequacy. In this particular case Loan - means all bank’s monetary
claims to the borrower, acquired shares (contributions or other portions of equity), reflected in the bank balance-sheet and off-balance sheet
items, also monetary obligations of the bank recognised in the bank’s off-balance.
6/ From June 2008, the data on loan portfolio quality is collected through FINREP tables (EU common reporting templates).
By this, overdue non-impaired loans and the impaired loans are separated.
The sum of these loans could be considered as non-performing loans, however the new series of non-performing loans are not comparable to the previous ones.
7/ Composition of liquid assets is defined in the Liquidity Ratio Calculation Rules approved by Resolution No. 1 of the Board of the Bank of Lithuania of 29 January 2004.
8/ Composition of current liabilities is defined in the Liquidity Ratio Calculation Rules approved by Resolution No. 1 of the Board of the Bank of Lithuania of 29 January 2004.
9/ Information is based on interbank deals of all maturities (mostly overnight) made between resident banks in national currency Litas within the last quarter of the period.
10/ From 2005, the major part of foreign currency loans and foreign currency liabilities are in euros.
11/ From end-2005 to Q1-2008, NPLs are loans with payments on which are overdue more than 60 days. Untill 2004 NPLs are loans in Substandard, Doubtful and Loss loans categories.
12/ Credit registry data from 2005, therefore, it is considered as estimate of actual sectoral distribution.
13/ As defined in Rules for Calculation of Capital Adequacy approved by Bank of Lithuania Board Resolution No. 138 of 9 November 2006.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in euro terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
 = nominal appreciation (increase in euro value of domestic currency), and  = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-(1+g(1+r1+g++g) times previous period debt stock. increases with an appreciating domestic currency (> 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; euro deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, euro deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

Current Status of Safeguards Assessments:

Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Bank of Lithuania (BOL) was subject to
and completed a safeguards assessment with respect to the Stand-By Arrangement, (the SBA
was approved on August 30, 2001 and expired on March 29, 2003) on December 10, 2001.
The assessment identified certain weaknesses and proposed appropriate recommendations as
reported in EBS/01/211. The BOL has implemented these recommendations.
X.

Exchange Arrangements:

The currency of Lithuania is the litas. From April 1, 1994 to February 1, 2002, the litas was
pegged to the U.S. dollar at LTL 4 per U.S. dollar under a currency board arrangement. Since
February 2, 2002 the litas has been pegged to the euro at LTL 3.4528 per euro. Lithuania
joined the European Union (EU) on May 1, 2004, and ERM II on June 28, 2004. Lithuania
has accepted the obligations of Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement and
maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payment and transfers for
current international transactions except for those maintained solely for the preservation of

3
national or international security and which have been notified to the Fund pursuant to
Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51).
XI.

Article IV Consultation:

Lithuania is on the 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation was
concluded on April 16, 2008. The Executive Board assessment is available at

the Fund to Lithuania since 1998.
XIII. Resident Representative: Mark Allen (stationed in Warsaw, Poland).
XIV. Anti-money laundering and combating financing of terrorism:
The money laundering prevention framework is based on the amended Law on the
Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing, Resolutions of the
Government, and Prevention Guidelines for credit institutions confirmed by a Resolution of
the Board of the Bank of Lithuania. In 2006, MONEYVAL evaluated
Lithuania’s AML/CFT framework and concluded that the system was quite sound while
suggesting improvements in the implementation of AML/CFT measures. An amended Law
on Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing was adopted in January 2008.
It transposes the Third Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Directive
2005/60/EC and Commission Directive 2006/70/EC laying down implementing measures for
Directive 2005/60/EC and Regulation (EC) No 1781/2006 relating to information on the
payer accompanying transfers of funds. It also incorporates the previous law's provisions that
transpose Regulation (EC) No 1889/2005 on controls of cash entering or leaving the
European Community as well as 40+9 FATF recommendations.

APPENDIX II: LITHUANIA: WORLD BANK RELATIONS

Lithuania graduated from World Bank financing in Fall 2006, and became an IDA donor
during the IDA 15 replenishment. The last Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) was launched
at the time of Lithuania's accession to the EU in May 2004. The CPS supported capacitybuilding for the public sector, sustaining growth through an improved business environment
as well as rural development, and reducing social vulnerability. All Bank-financed projects
under the last CPS have closed. The last two closed in December 2008—the Klaipeda Port
Project which enhanced the efficiency and safety of the Klaipeda port operations, and the
Vilnius Heat Demand Management Project (GEF-financed) which contributed to reducing
greenhouse gas emissions from the Vilnius District Heating system.
Following graduation, Lithuania maintained an active dialogue with the Bank and made use
of the Bank’s post-graduation TA which expired in fiscal 2009. The Bank provided technical
assistance to the Government of Lithuania on strengthening support to rural regions to assist
the implementation of the EU's rural development programs. More recently, the Lithuanian
authorities requested use of Bank-financed technical assistance to assist the Ministry of
Education and Science in producing and absorbing innovation, research and development to
compete more effectively in the European market. Bank engagement has also included the
development of a public private partnership framework as well as the development of the
consumer protection and pension annuities being undertaken region-wide.
The Bank has recently launched two pieces of crisis-related analytical work with the
Lithuanian authorities, which would underpin any future engagement. These are a public
expenditure review and a financial sector vulnerability assessment.
Public Expenditure Review
A rapid-response public expenditure review focusing on social sectors and public
administration was delivered in May 2009 to help the government in their preparation for the
June 2009 budget amendment and beyond. The Public Expenditure Review (PER) looks at
both short run fiscal consolidation measures as well as efficiency-enhancing reforms that
could eventually generate fiscal savings and reduce the fiscal deficit over the medium term.
In particular, in the context of increased social needs arising from the crisis, the report also
tries to identify the changes needed in social assistance benefits to better protect the poor and
vulnerable during the crisis and beyond in a cost-efficient way. The PER also analyses the
public administration, the public wage bill and the civil service.

6
Financial Sector Vulnerability Assessment
The work was launched in June 2009 as a piece of sector work. This banking assessment
sector work focuses on the overall credit portfolio and liquidity condition of banks as well as
the regulatory framework and institutional measures and the role of bank supervisors
including availability of discretionary (Pillar 2, Basel II) powers to mandate system-wide
regulations to prevent sector deterioration. The study also examines corporate debt issues and
reviews both the judicial and extra-judicial procedures for corporate debt restructuring and
corporate bankruptcy processes, and assesses the viability of implementing efficient
out-of-court procedures to facilitate sound debt restructuring frameworks.

APPENDIX III. LITHUANIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Over the past several years, Lithuania has made good progress in establishing a
macroeconomic database. Official data for all sectors are adequate for surveillance purposes.
Lithuania subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) in May 1996, and
its metadata have been posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(DSBB) since April 1997. Lithuania meets the SDDS specifications for coverage, periodicity
and timeliness of the data, and for the dissemination of the advance release calendars. A
significant amount of economic and financial information is now available on various
websites through the Internet (see section on Dissemination of Statistics, below). A ROSC
data module was published in November 2002.
National Accounts
The national accounts are compiled by Statistics Lithuania (SL) (the former Department of
Statistics) in accordance with the guidelines of the European System of Accounts 1995
(ESA 95). Quarterly GDP estimates at current and at constant prices are compiled using both
the production and expenditure approaches. GDP estimates by production are considered to
be more reliable than the corresponding estimates by expenditure, but no statistical
discrepancies between these two estimates are shown in the published figures as the
discrepancies are included in the estimates of changes in inventories. The annual and the
quarterly national accounts are compiled at previous year prices and chain-linked to 2000. In
general, good data sources and sound methods are used for the compilation of the national
accounts, but measuring activity in the current volatile environment is proving very
challenging, resulting in large published inventory changes. Moreover, difficulties remain in
measuring the economic activity of the informal sector. These estimates are compiled at
detailed levels of economic activity using fixed coefficients derived from a benchmark
surveys conducted in 1996 and 2003, and updated in 2006. A further update of the size of the
informal sector as of 2008 is expected to be released in late 2010-early 2011.
Price Data
Since December 1998, CPI weights have been updated annually. The monthly CPI is
available in the second week following the reference month. The producer price index is
calculated according to the chain-linked Laspeyres formula with weights updated every year.

8
Public Finance
Data on the central government budget execution are available at a monthly and quarterly
frequency, although these data are subject to frequent revisions. The ongoing treasury project
is expected to improve fiscal data quality substantially. However, further work is needed to
clarify the treatment of public health care providers and of EU transactions, and the
consolidation procedure for government operations. A new classification, incorporating the
GFSM2001 was approved in mid-2003. Since then, the MoF has been reporting to STA
general government’s annual data on an accrual and cash basis (except for local
governments, which are still on a cash basis) for publication in the Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook (GFSY). In addition, the MoF has been reporting quarterly and monthly
data in the GFSM 2001 format for publication in the IFS.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
The Bank of Lithuania (BoL) reports monetary and financial statistics (MFS) to STA on a
timely and regular basis. The scope, concepts and definitions of the MFS are broadly in line
with the guidelines of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). Following
Lithuania’s accession to the European Union, the BoL implemented the ECB framework for
compiling and reporting monetary data reflecting the ECB regulations and ESA 95 on
sectorization, valuation and classification of financial instruments.
External Sector
The BoL is responsible for compiling balance of payments, international investment position
(IIP), external debt and international reserves statistics. The BoL reports quarterly data on
balance of payments, IIP and monthly international reserves to STA on a timely and regular
basis. Balance of payments data (on a monthly and quarterly basis) are compiled using the
format recommended in the Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5). The monthly
data correspond to several key balance of payments components, compiled on the basis of a
sample survey covering the public sector, commercial banks, and some nonfinancial private
sector institutions. The Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency
Liquidity is disseminated monthly according to the operational guidelines and is hyperlinked
to the Fund’s DSBB. Since late 2004, the BoL disseminates quarterly external debt data in
the World Bank’s Quarterly External Debt Statistics (QEDS) database.
Dissemination of Statistics
The authorities publish a range of economic statistics through a number of publications,
including the SL's monthly publication, Economic and Social Developments, and the BoL's
monthly Bulletin. A significant amount of data are available on the Internet:

9


metadata for data categories defined by the Special Data Dissemination Standard are
posted on the IMF’s DSBB (http://dsbb.imf.org);

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation
with the Republic of Lithuania
On August 7, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Lithuania.1
Background
The Lithuanian economy is undergoing a severe adjustment, after years of rapid economic
growth and financial integration. With the global financial crisis, the unwinding of the imbalances
accumulated during the boom has led to a sharp economic contraction. Capital inflows came to
a halt in late 2008 and reversed in 2009, and the current account deficit turned into a surplus.
GDP growth for the first half of the year has been provisionally assessed at -18.1 percent (y/y).
Price and wage pressures have quickly abated with inflation going down to 4.2 percent as of June,
and wages in the private sector are adjusting rapidly.
Government finances have come under considerable strain with the legacy of a sizable
structural deficit built up during the boom and the sharp correction in economic activity. By
end-2008, the cyclically adjusted balance had risen to 6½ percent of GDP, notably reflecting
generous wage and social benefit increases.
As tax revenues contracted by 28 percent (y/y), the headline central government fiscal deficit
widened to 4.6 percent of full-year GDP by end-May 2009. The general government debt

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
burden has risen from very low levels to 23 percent of GDP. The expansion of budget financing
needs has been associated with shortening maturities and rising borrowing costs. Faced with a
deterioration of the fiscal deficit and debt sustainability, the authorities have responded with a
sizeable adjustment. The original budget together with the May and July 2009 supplementary
budgets implemented a fiscal adjustment exceeding 7½ percent of GDP through a combination
of spending cuts and tax increases but also a temporary reduction in transfers to the second
pension pillar. Financial assistance from the European Investment Bank and a successful €500
million eurobond issue in June helped ease immediate fiscal financing needs, and the latter
reopened access to international capital markets. The eurobond also helped to boost
international reserves: by end-June international reserves stood at €4.45 billion, up from €4.2
billion end-May but still down from end-2008 levels. Although international reserves cover 145
percent of the central bank’s total liabilities in domestic currency, they only cover 3 months of
imports and about 46 percent of short-term debt (remaining maturity.
The banking system is in the midst of a pronounced credit contraction reflecting deteriorating
asset quality, lower funding, and lack of credit demand. The stock of credit to the private sector
has already declined by 4.1 percent in the first six months of 2009. The banking system remains
well capitalized overall—with a capital adequacy ratio (CAR) at 13.9 percent as of Q1 2009—
but the stock of non performing loans increased rapidly to 8.2 percent while loan loss
provisioning increased, albeit, at a lower pace. In October 2008, a deposit run drained
6½ percent of total deposits and while liquidity has since stabilized, deposits have shifted
increasingly into foreign currencies. The Bank of Lithuania (BoL) has reacted swiftly to these
challenges. Since October 2008 it reduced reserve requirements from 6 to 4 percent to help
ease liquidity pressures, and improved internal guidelines for lender of last resort operations
(LoLR), while monitoring daily bank-by-bank deposits and liquidity positions. The deposit
insurance limit was raised to €100,000 and bank resolution tools are also being enhanced
through the Financial Stability Law, which provides for government guarantees of interbank
lending, as well as public support for bank recapitalization and asset purchases. The
government has also established a financial crisis preparedness committee to enhance
coordination.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that the Lithuanian economy is undergoing a painful adjustment from
overheating fueled by large capital inflows and expansionary fiscal policy. The reversal in capital
flows following the global crisis has led to an unprecedented economic contraction with recovery
expected to take hold only in 2011. Directors considered that uncertainty around the outlook
remains but with downside risks.
Directors recognized the authorities’ strong commitment to maintain the currency board
arrangement, which has served as a useful macroeconomic anchor. They noted the staff’s
assessment that the real effective exchange rate is moderately overvalued, while
acknowledging the uncertainties surrounding these estimates. Moreover, under the currency
board arrangement, the adjustment burden falls directly on domestic policies, in particular

3
sizable fiscal consolidation, and structural reforms to improve the functioning of labor and
product markets. Policies to safeguard financial stability are also crucial.
Directors praised the sizable fiscal consolidation implemented since late-2008, including the
recent supplementary budgets, and the medium-term fiscal consolidation plans.
Notwithstanding the ongoing economic contraction and risks of exacerbating the downturn, they
recognized that fiscal adjustment is necessary to offset past expansionary policies and underpin
the credibility of the currency board arrangement and the authorities’ Euro adoption strategy.
Directors concurred that fiscal adjustment be achieved by front-loaded structural reform.
Spending needs to be reduced to more affordable levels, primarily through wage and social
benefit reform, and additional revenue measures need to be introduced, including broadening
the tax base and improving compliance. Directors encouraged the targeting of social assistance
programs to protect the most vulnerable, and considered that institutional reforms, such as
multi-year budgeting, could also aid adjustment.
Directors observed that the banking system is well capitalized, but that liquidity and capital
buffers could suffer in the recession. They commended steps taken by the authorities to
respond to the crisis, including passage of the Financial Stability Law and the increase in the
deposit guarantee. Noting the rise in non-performing loans, Directors advocated greater buffers
in the financial system, including through accelerated loan-loss provisioning and preemptive
increases in bank capital based on stress tests, as well as contingency planning. They
encouraged the authorities to seek further explicit commitments from parent banks to provide
necessary capital and liquidity support to their subsidiaries. Directors saw scope for closer
supervision of banks with costlier funding profiles and the introduction of a purchase and
assumption option to enhance bank resolution tools. They also encouraged the speedy
restructuring of corporate and household debt to facilitate the recovery.
Directors saw the strength of the recovery and medium-term growth as hinging on improved
competitiveness and reorientation of production towards tradables. Private sector wage
adjustment, complemented by public wage reductions, is necessary to reduce costs economywide. Directors commended recent reforms to enhance labor market flexibility and reduce
regulations. They called for further efforts to improve the business environment, including by
reducing administrative burdens in business planning and land regulation, and through
efficiency gains in the energy sector.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
August 7, 2009
1.
This statement reports on key data releases and measures undertaken by the
authorities since the staff report was issued. The new information does not alter the thrust of
the staff appraisal.
Policy developments
2.
Parliament adopted a second revision to the 2009 budget on July 23. The package
comprises (i) on the tax side, an increase in the standard VAT rate from 19 to 21 percent
effective September 1, an increase in the VAT rate for heating from 5 percent to 9 percent
(albeit less than previously planned), and a decrease in diesel excise taxes; and, (ii) on the
expenditure side, a cut of 5 percent cut in the basic wage of civil servants combined with
progressive cuts in wage scale coefficients and bonuses, as well as a 8 percent reduction in
teachers, police, and health workers’ wages reflecting similar changes to that implemented
for civil servants, with changes for both categories of worker effective through end-2010. A
10 percent cut in maternity and paternity benefits was also approved but subsequently vetoed
by the President of the Republic given concerns about its implications on existing benefit
recipients, although the reduction in the maternity allowance replacement rate for new
recipients to 90 percent for the first year, and 75 percent for the second year from July 2010
onwards was cleared. As measures are being implemented later than previously expected and
the yield from some is smaller than anticipated, the authorities’ have reduced their estimate
of the net savings from the package from the 0.7 percent of GDP noted in the staff report to
0.4 percent of GDP in 2009 (and from 1.7 to 1.2 percent of GDP annualized). On the basis of
the GDP forecasts presented in the staff report, these savings would place the fiscal deficit in
the range of about 9½ percent of GDP in 2009.
3.
Parliament also adopted the Financial Stability Law and an amended Deposit
Insurance Law. The former further strengthens the capacity of the government to speedily
address potential problem banks, should the need arise, by providing the government the
power to intervene a bank. However, due to constraints in Lithuania’s legal framework, the
new Financial Stability Law does not provide for more flexible alternatives such as the
purchase and assumption of problem banks. A working group comprising government and
Bank of Lithuania representatives has been created to facilitate the rapid formulation of the
implementing regulations for this law. In addition, the law on deposit insurance was amended
to render permanent the increase in deposit insurance up to €100 000—consistent with EU
directives— and to shorten the compensation period for payments to depositors to a
maximum of 20 business days from the day of the insured event.

Recent macroeconomic indicators
4.
Provisional flash GDP estimates for the second quarter revealed a
deeper-than-expected contraction in economic activity. For the second quarter, the flash
estimate of headline GDP growth was assessed by Statistics Lithuania at -22.4 percent (y/y),
a substantially higher contraction than anticipated by consensus and staff forecasts (the latter
at -15.5 percent), while revisions to the first quarter GDP data were relatively minor.
5.
The flash GDP estimate underscores the downside risks to the forecasts in the
staff report. The depth of the decline in GDP was sharper than suggested by certain
higher-frequency indicators which had which signaled a tentative stabilization of activity,
albeit at a very weak level. Seasonally adjusted, industrial production had begun to move
upwards on a month-on-month basis during the second quarter, and the same for retail sales
on a year-on-year basis. Given the uncertainty surrounding the flash estimates—including the
large role played by statistical discrepancies in driving the first quarter GDP outturn—and
the fact that the components of GDP will only be available end-August, the growth
projection presented in the staff report remains staff’s most recent estimate. However, should
the GDP flash estimates be confirmed, staff would reappraise its GDP growth forecast to be
in the range of -20 percent for 2009, with a preliminary assessment suggesting a worsening in
the general government deficit of at least of 1.0 percent of GDP for 2009 to around
10½ percent of GDP (9.1 percent of GDP in the staff report) and an increase in the 2010
financing need of about 1¾ percent of GDP.
6.
Recent monetary data point to continued tightening in monetary conditions
while the recent eurobond issue helped boost international reserves. End-June data show
reserve money contracted by 14¾ percent (y/y) and broad money by 7.6 percent (y/y). By
end-June 2009, international reserves stood at €4.45 billion, showing an improvement
relative to end-May (€4.2 billion) and reflecting the impact of the €500 million eurobond
issue.
7.
Reflecting the ongoing credit contraction, private sector credit growth
decelerated to 1.5 percent year-on-year in June, from 17.8 percent as of end-2008. Over
the six months since December, credit to the private sector has decreased by 4.1 percent. The
adjustment has been particularly sharp in household credit, with new loans extended falling
by 55 percent (y/y). The share of foreign currency denominated loans and deposits has risen
to 68 and 31.9 percent, respectively.
8.
Preliminary data show the half year central government deficit measured on a
cash basis widened to 5.3 percent of staff’s full-year GDP estimate, as the decline in
revenue outpaced spending. Tax revenues were down about 29 percent (y/y). Although
spending in the first half was up by about 10 percent (y/y) in nominal terms relative to the
same period in 2008, this in part reflects higher interest outlays, and base effects. Relative to
the second half of 2008, spending excluding interest was down over 3 percent in nominal
terms.
