EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Growth performance has improved in recent years. The economy grew by over
5 percent per year in real terms in 2003 and 2004. Over the medium-term, staff
forecasts real GDP growth to average 6 percent, which falls between the high and low
growth scenarios of the authorities’ Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP).
Sustaining high levels of growth should help reduce income poverty, a key objective
of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

•

Inflation subsided in 2003, but rose sharply throughout 2004. This increase
reflected the depreciation of the exchange rate, increases in the world prices of rice
and oil, the impact of two cyclones, and inconsistent implementation of monetary
policy in early 2004. Inflation peaked at 30 percent in February 2005, before
declining as the domestic price of rice started to fall.

•

Significant tax reform measures were implemented, particularly at customs, but
revenue performance continues to be weak. In spite of these efforts, the ad hoc
exemptions granted in 2003 further eroded the revenue base. The authorities agreed
on the need to gradually raise Madagascar’s relatively low tax-to-GDP ratio.

•

Persistent weaknesses in public expenditure management have complicated
budget execution. Lack of expenditure control and extensive recourse to emergency
spending procedures led to fiscal overruns in recent years. Efforts are underway to
strengthen the budget process as well as public expenditure management, in order to
improve the effectiveness of the budget as a poverty-reducing instrument.

•

Considerable uncertainty surrounds the medium-term outlook for the balance of
payments. Exports on the whole have performed well, but have become increasingly
concentrated on clothing to the United States. The expiration of the Agreement on
Textiles and Clothing (ATC) in early 2005 and the expected end of certain provisions
of the African Growth Opportunity Act (AGOA III) in 2007 underscore the need to
preserve and build on the competitiveness gains achieved in the wake of the exchange
rate depreciation in 2004.

•

Some progress has been achieved in strengthening competition and improving
governance. Key public enterprises were either privatized or put under private
management, although often with significant delays; prices in the petroleum sector
were liberalized in 2004; and the fight against corruption has been accelerated.

•

Institutional capacity constraints continue to hinder the authorities’ ability to
formulate and implement macroeconomic policy. The authorities should make
capacity building a priority and ensure that their efforts in this area benefit from
coordinated donor support.

•

The authorities expressed strong interest in pursuing relations with the Fund in the
form of a PRGF successor arrangement, a strategy also favored in the Ex Post
Assessment Report.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The Article IV consultations took place against the backdrop of renewed
political stability and rising inflation concerns. While the country’s economic performance
improved in recent years, the economy remains vulnerable to shocks, including cyclones, and
policy slippages. Political stability has been broadly restored, following the disputed 2001
presidential elections and the ensuing political crisis. However, the legacy of the crisis
remains vivid, with some opposition leaders still in jail (without trial) or in exile. The second
3-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement expired in March 2005
and an ex post assessment was carried out to assess the Fund’s long-term engagement in the
country.
2.
The authorities’ response to past Fund policy advice has been mixed. In the
context of the PRSP, they have prepared a medium-term development plan, which includes
specific poverty reduction programs, and have taken measures to improve tax and customs
administration. However, progress in revenue mobilization and in strengthening the budget
process has been limited. This reflects persistent weaknesses in public expenditure
management, as well as limited institutional capacity. The Ex Post Assessment Report,
www.imf.org, discusses these issues in more detail.

II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Real GDP growth was strong during 2003-04, but real per capita GDP remained
below its pre-2002 level. Following the civil-strife related economic slump of 2002, the
recovery in 2003 was broad based (Figure 1); the tertiary sector, in particular, rebounded
strongly. In 2004, despite the impact of two

growth is estimated to have reached 5.3 percent,
buoyed by strong performance in the
agricultural, construction, tourism, transport,
and the Export Processing Zones (EPZ) sectors.
Real GDP growth
This performance notwithstanding, real per
capita GDP at end-2004 is estimated at about
92 percent of its 2001 level.

Macroeconomic developments were dominated by a sharp depreciation of the
Malagasy franc. The exchange rate depreciated by about 50 percent against the euro in the
first half of 2004 (Figure 2), owing mainly to

Inflation subsided in 2003 but has picked up sharply since the beginning of 2004.
Year-on-year consumer price inflation, after falling by about 1 percent in 2003, accelerated
in 2004 and early 2005 (Figure 3). The sharp

6.
Monetary policy has been tightened in the course of 2004 to help contain
inflationary pressures. In 2003, the Central Bank of Madagascar (BCM) pursued an
expansionary monetary policy, following the economic slump in 2002, with a view to
accelerating the recovery of economic growth. The BCM responded slowly and
inconsistently to the sharp exchange rate depreciation and intensifying inflationary pressures
in early 2004.1 Nonetheless, the successive tightening measures taken since April 20042 led

Inconsistent implementation of monetary policy and inadequate coordination between the Ministry
of Finance and the BCM sometimes led to erratic liquidity management (see Staff Report for the fifth
review, IMF Country Report No. 04/404, December 10, 2004.

-7-

to a significant increase in interest rates (Figure 4, attached, and Figure 5), thus keeping
interest rates substantially higher than inflation (excluding rice and oil prices). In spite of
these measures, broad money growth (as measured by M3, including foreign currency
deposits), which had started to decelerate (on a year-on-year basis) since August, increased
sharply in December (Figure 6). This reflected inter alia the accumulation of net foreign
assets by the BCM and a strong increase in credit to the private sector. The increase in credit
to the private sector has been driven mainly by credit to privately owned oil companies,
following the liberalization of the sector in 2004.

7.
Financial soundness indicators have improved since the 2002 economic slump.
Profitability and prudential indicators for the banking sector have improved in recent years
and banks appeared to be adequately capitalized and liquid (Text Table 1). The ratio of
nonperforming loans (NPLs) to total gross loans fell from 19.6 percent in 2002 to
11.4 percent in 2004. This reflects not only a decline in NPLs, but also the rapid rise in
credit. Furthermore, the exposure of foreign banks to a few “niche” borrowers and use of
guarantees provided by their headquarters have increased in recent months. A Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) mission scheduled for first half of 2005, with a first
mission fielded in April, will examine these issues.

2

The BCM raised its base rate in April, June, and September 2004, increased the reserve requirement
rate in three steps, including by broadening the reserve base in April 2004 and again in March 2005,
and has held reverse auctions since mid-2004.

Implementation of the main recommendations of the Stage One Report of the
Safeguards Assessments continued in 2004 with help from the Monetary and Financial
Systems Department (MFD). In line with the recommendations of the safeguards
assessment, the central bank (i) published its complete audited financial statements for 2003
in December 2004; (ii) adopted a new accounting framework effective January 1, 2005; and
(iii) is in the process of completing the documentation of its internal control system for
reserve management and foreign exchange related activities. In addition, an anti-money
laundering legislation adopted in 2004 became operational in 2005.

Despite the implementation of significant reforms at customs, revenue
performance continued to be weak. The tax base remains narrow, reflecting the lack of

Persistent weaknesses in public expenditure management have complicated
budget execution. Current primary expenditure overruns reached 0.8 and 0.5 percent of
GDP in 2003 and 2004, respectively, reflecting extensive recourse to emergency spending
procedures in both years. Insufficient control over expenditure undertaken by decentralized
government bodies and public entities also contributed to the 2004 outturn.5 Nonetheless,
total government expenditure has been contained, as the overruns in some areas were
partially offset by lower investment outlays in 2003, and by the reining in of other
expenditures, particularly wages, in 2004. As a result, the domestic balance improved by
1 percent of GDP in 2004,6 and the government was able to reduce its domestic indebtedness
in an amount equivalent to 2.8 percent of GDP.
3

In August 2003, tax and tariff exemptions were granted by law on a large array of capital and
selected other commodities. Originally envisaged to last two years, they were partially rescinded in
August 2004, and will be fully eliminated in September 2005.

Comparator countries were chosen based on the share of agriculture in GDP, and their development

These operations are recorded as treasury operations in the fiscal tables.

At the same time, the overall deficit widened by 0.9 percent of GDP, following higher-thanexpected foreign financed investment.

- 10 -

11.
In spite of the sharp depreciation of the exchange rate, the current account
deficit widened considerably in 2004. Even though EPZs and tourism related activities
performed strongly following the depreciation of the exchange rate, the current account
deficit (excluding grants) widened from 8 percent of GDP in 2003 to 14 percent of GDP in
2004, reflecting a sharp decline in the volume of vanilla exports which were affected by the
cyclones in early 2004. In addition, imports of equipment increased by about 60 percent,
following the tax and tariff exemptions granted in August 2003. The current account deficit
was financed mainly by external loans and capital grants. In spite of an accumulation of
SDR 49 million, gross international reserves remain low, amounting to about 2.8 months of
imports.

Exports on the whole have performed well, but have become increasingly
concentrated on clothing exports to the United States. Madagascar has traditionally had a
diverse export base. Over the last few years, traditional exports, including agricultural
exports, have shown weak growth. However, exports of clothing, especially to the United
States have performed well, benefiting from the third party provision of the African Growth
Opportunity Act (AGOA III) (Text Table 3). As a consequence, the U.S. market share of the
total value of exports has increased by half since 1990, and reached 30 percent in 2003.
13.
Progress, albeit slow, has been achieved in implementing key structural reforms.
Significant progress has been achieved in structural reforms aimed at lowering the cost of
doing business. Madagascar has streamlined its legal requirements for setting up private
sector business, and introduced a one-stop center for all prospective investors. In addition,
the authorities have revised the land law to allow foreigners limited access to land ownership
in Madagascar and the mining code to attract corporate investors into the sector. Some
progress has also been achieved in the fight against corruption, and a new anti-corruption
bureau was established in October 2004. However, progress on public enterprise reform was
slow. After considerable delay, the telecommunications company (TELMA), the cotton
company (HASYMA), and the sugar company (SIRAMA), have been either privatized or put
under private management in 2004. A private company has been selected to manage the

- 11 -

utility company (JIRAMA) starting in the first half of 2005, although the medium-term
strategy for the sector is yet to be defined.
III. EX POST ASSESSMENT (EPA) DISCUSSIONS
14.
The report on the Ex Post Assessment of the Fund’s long-term engagement with
Madagascar was discussed with the authorities in the context of the 2005 Article IV
consultation. The authorities were in broad agreement with the analysis and
recommendations of the report. They hoped that the Fund would engage in discussions on a
successor arrangement in view of the country’s continuing balance of payments and
development needs. They agreed that the main challenge facing Madagascar is to achieve
higher economic growth rates necessary to reduce poverty significantly, and recognized the
importance of improving domestic revenue mobilization, although there was some discussion
on the best strategy to reach this goal (see paragraph 26 below). The authorities also hoped
that, with a possible new program, a closer partnership would develop between Madagascar
and the Fund. They indicated that ownership of Fund-supported programs had increased
significantly in recent years, and felt the Fund did not always adequately explain the rationale
for policy measures proposed under the program in the past. They also emphasized the need
for continued technical assistance to support their capacity building efforts. The international
donor community and representatives of NGOs, on their part, expressed their desire for
continued Fund involvement in Madagascar, noting its anchor role in instilling
macroeconomic discipline.
IV. ECONOMIC PROSPECTS AND RISKS
15.
Madagascar’s poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) presents two growth
scenarios for the period 2004-06. The PRSP presents a high growth scenario of 7.5 percent
and a low growth scenario of 4.5 percent. The high growth scenario assumes that the private
sector savings rate and the absorptive capacity of the economy will increase sharply, which
would allow for a higher level of domestic investment and result in a large budget deficit
(including grants). The low growth scenario assumes that the rate of project implementation,
investment productivity, and the flow of foreign resources will be the same as the 1999-2003
average (excluding 2002). The PRSP envisages inter alia promotion of good governance and
significant increases of public expenditure on priority sectors, such as education, health, and
road infrastructure.
16.
There was broad agreement on economic prospects for 2005. The authorities
concurred with staff’s projection of 6.3 percent real GDP growth in 2005. This reflects strong
growth in agriculture, tourism, and construction sectors. Fiscal consolidation is expected to
continue, in line with the 2005 finance law projections, with the revenue performance
reaching 11.4 percent of GDP and expenditures being contained, thus allowing for a

- 12 -

1.7 percent of GDP improvement in the domestic balance.7 This fiscal stance and continued
tight monetary policy are expected to contribute to a fall in inflation to 7 percent at end-2005
(on a year-on-year basis). Exports of goods and services (tourism in particular) are projected
to pick up and the volume of imports to slow down temporarily, following its sharp increase
in 2004. The current account deficit (excluding grants) would decline to 11.5 percent of GDP
in 2005. However, due to lower foreign financing relative to 2004, gross international
reserves are expected to fall marginally to 2.7 months of imports in 2005.
17.
Over the medium-term, real GDP growth is projected by staff to average
6 percent, which falls between the high and low growth scenarios of the PRSP. These
projections assume that both private and public investment would decline slightly relative to
GDP following the sharp increase in 2004 investment. It is also assumed that Madagascar
will remain politically stable, maintain sound macroeconomic policies, improve governance,
continue reforms of the business environment, and attract relatively high levels of foreign
direct investment and donor assistance (including from the Millennium Challenge
Corporation (MCC), see Box 1). Growth would be spurred by strong performance in the
agricultural, agro-based industry, construction, mining, and tourism sectors. The PRSP,
which is being updated in the context of a second annual progress report, is expected to be in
line with these assumptions.
18.
The budgetary framework for the medium term envisages further fiscal
consolidation. Revenue projections assume the successful implementation of a
comprehensive reform of the tax system (which would result inter alia in a significant
widening of the tax base), as well as a buoyant macroeconomic environment. At the same
time, expenditures are expected to be contained, while allowing for a gradual increase in
domestically financed investment outlays and higher poverty spending, resulting in the
buildup of a small domestic surplus in the outer years.
19.
The external outlook is expected to improve in the medium term. The projections
reflect a sharp deceleration in the growth of textile exports in 2005, in large part due to the
impact of the expiry of the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC), and a further
deceleration in 2006 due to the expected termination of AGOA III provisions in 2007. Thus,
significant balance of payments needs are expected to continue. However, some
improvement in the current account is envisaged in the medium term, due to a pick-up in
export activities, especially in the tourism and EPZ sectors, in response to the recent gains in
competitiveness. External financing requirements will remain relatively high due to the
country’s large infrastructure needs, but the authorities are committed to borrowing only on
concessional terms. These developments, together with growth in private transfers, would
allow Madagascar to accumulate international reserves equivalent to about 4 months of
imports by 2009.
7

At the same time, priority spending is foreseen to increase substantially. For example, health
expenditures are projected to increase by 40 percent compared to the 2004 outturn.

- 13 -

Box 1. The Millennium Challenge Corporation and Madagascar
The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) was established by the U.S. Government
in 2004 to provide development assistance in the form of grants to low-income countries
that rule justly, invest in their people, and encourage economic freedom. Madagascar is
the first country to sign an agreement with the MCC. This agreement, signed in April
2005, includes projects in the amount of US$110 million over a period of four years,
covering the following three areas that are considered important for growth and poverty
reduction in Madagascar:
Land tenure: The current backlog of requests for land titles cannot be processed due to
lack of resources and cumbersome registration procedures. This, in turn, impedes rural
investment, land development, expansion of collateral-based lending, and agricultural
productivity growth. The project should increase land titling and security and improve the
efficiency of land service administration.
Financial sector development: The project is designed to: (i) promote legal and
regulatory reforms, with particular focus on capital markets and competition in
commercial banking; (ii) strengthen sovereign debt management and issuance, including
extending the yield curve and broadening access to the Treasury bill market;
(iii) strengthen the national savings bank, by reducing transaction costs; (iv) promote new
financial instruments for financing agriculture, including working capital for farmers;
(v) improve the payments system; and (vi) improve the quality of demand for credit,
including the establishment of a credit information bureau, and training for microfinance
institutions.
Agricultural business investment: A key element of Madagascar’s agricultural
development strategy is to assist farmers in transitioning from subsistence farming to
market agriculture. The MCC will help enhance research, provide access to improved
technologies, farm management and business planning, infrastructure development, and
policies to enhance productivity and returns to investment.
20.
The external debt position remains fragile. The updated debt indicators remain
broadly in line with projections presented in the completion point document www.imf.org
albeit at slightly lower levels (Table 1).8 The ratio of debt to exports falls below the level of
the HIPC thresholds only after the delivery of additional bilateral debt relief beyond the
HIPC Initiative. The authorities are making strong efforts to obtain full HIPC Initiative
8

A fully updated debt sustainability analysis (DSA), prepared jointly with the Bank, is expected to be
carried out later in 2005, as Madagascar falls in the transition period under the guidelines for the
presentation of jointly agreed Fund/Bank DSAs.

- 14 -

assistance. They have contacted all the non-Paris Club creditors and are well advanced in
their negotiations with Paris Club creditors, including on additional debt relief. They also
intend to strengthen debt management capacity, particularly through enhanced coordination
between the Treasury and the central bank.
21.
There are several risks to the medium-term outlook. First, as illustrated by past
slippages, reforms envisaged in the PRSP may not materialize due to political pressure from
vested interests. Second, the external outlook is subject to considerable uncertainties as
(i) prices of vanilla—Madagascar’s main traditional export commodity—may fall by more
than projected;9 (ii) the impact of the expiry of the ATC could be larger than expected in
2005; and (iii) the termination of the third party apparel provision of AGOA, scheduled for
September 2007, may be more damaging than projected to the textile market. The
concentration of exports over the past few years in clothing renders the balance of payments
particularly vulnerable. On the other hand, larger amounts of external assistance and foreign
direct investment, together with appropriate measures to increase absorptive capacity, could
lead to higher GDP growth rates over the long run.
V. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
22.
Considerable progress has been made in stabilizing the economy and laying the
foundation for higher growth, but daunting challenges remain if income poverty is to be
significantly reduced in coming years. Achievement of this goal requires a more efficient
expenditure management to ensure that public resources contribute effectively to realizing
the other MDGs. Policy discussions focused on: (i) policies to maintain macroeconomic
stability and improve the economy’s resilience to shocks; (ii) measures to improve
competitiveness; (iii) public expenditure management; and (iv) data issues and capacity
building.

A. Maintaining Macroeconomic Stability and Improving Resilience to Shocks.
23.
The authorities concurred that inflation remains a key concern for
macroeconomic stability. While the price of rice has begun to fall in March 2005 and is
expected to decline further in the coming months, the deflationary impact of this decrease
could be partly offset by the effects of oil price increases. The authorities revised the inflation
target for end-2005 upward from 5.5 percent to 7 percent to reflect the impact of higher oil
prices. In the staff’s view, this revised target is achievable, provided that the envisaged tight
monetary and fiscal policies are fully implemented, and that oil prices moderate and rice

9

While a sharp decline is factored into the medium term projections of vanilla prices as a result of
global excess supply, early 2005 transactions took place at even lower prices.

- 15 -

prices decline in the coming months.10 In this context, the authorities continue to monitor
monetary developments closely and stand ready to raise interest rates further, should
inflationary pressures not abate. They are also determined to make every effort to ensure that
the improvement of the domestic fiscal balance by 1.7 percent of GDP foreseen in the 2005
finance law materializes. In particular, they are of the view that the strict implementation of
the revenue enhancing measures discussed with staff (Box 2) will allow them to meet their
revenue target for 2005, in spite of the disappointing first quarter outturn. The authorities are
confident in their ability to keep expenditures in line with available resources, and have
already started implementing measures to this effect (see Section C below). Staff stressed
that the authorities’ 2005 fiscal targets were ambitious and required full implementation of
the revenue measures and strengthened expenditure control. The decision to limit statutory
advances from the BCM to 10 percent of the previous year’s tax revenue, down from
15 percent under the previous agreement, was welcome.
Box 2. Revenue Measures in 2005
At customs, measures include:
•
Collapse of the two remaining trade taxes—customs duties and import taxes—into
one;
•
Elimination of the customs duties advance scheme as of January 2005;
•
Strengthened use of the risk management system, in order to increase the selectivity of
controls and accelerate the customs clearing process;
•
Effective use of the new ASYCUDA ++ software in the main port starting
April 1, 2005 and progressive deployment to the 5 largest customs bureaus by
August 2005; and
•
Mandatory payment of customs duties through the banking system, effective in
April 2005.
At the tax directorate, measures include:
•
Intensification of tax inspections through the systematic use of data generated by other
financial administrations, in particular customs, the treasury, and the public
procurement office;
•
Effective use of the new tax management software by end-June 2005;
•
Intensification of inspection and strengthened collection procedures for excise taxes;
and
•
Launching of an inspection campaign in the tourism sector.

24.
The authorities recognized the need to improve the effectiveness of monetary
policy. Developments in 2004 have shown that the instruments currently available to the
BCM could be used more effectively to achieve monetary policy targets. Against this
10

See Chapter I of the Selected Issues Paper for an empirical study undertaken by staff on
determinants of inflation in Madagascar.

- 16 -

background, the authorities intend to implement the recommendations of a recent MFD
technical assistance mission, regarding (i) the development of indirect monetary policy
instruments. In particular, they have agreed to gradually convert the securitized government
debt held by the BCM into marketable securities; (ii) the operational framework for liquidity
forecasting and management; (iii) further enhancement of the coordination with the Treasury;
and (iv) the development of the money market.
25.
The authorities are committed to strengthening banking supervision and the
contribution of the financial sector to economic growth. The recent appointment of the
members of the Banking Supervision Commission (CSBF) should help ensure that the
prudential regulations are strictly adhered to by all banks, but the CSBF continues to have
staffing problems and it has not yet been able to carry out on-site inspections owing to a lack
of qualified staff. In this regard, the authorities indicated that they have established an action
plan for 2005. The CSBF has also begun to establish closer cooperation with the supervisory
agencies in foreign banks’ home countries. Moreover, the development of the financial
infrastructure is a priority to be supported by donors, including the Fund, the World Bank,
and the MCC. A law establishing the legal framework for microfinance operations is to be
approved by Parliament later in 2005.
26.
The authorities agreed that improving revenue mobilization remains key to
enhancing macroeconomic stability, but acknowledged that conflicting views about the
goals of fiscal reform hinder progress. The lack of consensus on a reform strategy for the
tax system, and particularly for domestic taxes, still prevents the revenue-to-GDP ratio from
reaching levels attained by similar African countries. In turn, the difficulties in adhering to
reform objectives reflect the persistence of conflicting opinions about the role of the tax
system. At the center of the debate is the perceived contradiction between the need to raise
fiscal revenue and the desired increase of private investment flows to stimulate private sector
growth. In this context, the authorities were of the view that the expected effects on
economic activity of granting special fiscal incentives often outweigh the implied losses in
tax revenue, as evidenced by the August 2003 exemptions. Staff stressed that the uneven
success of the EPZ strategy in certain sectors pointed to the limitations of the special tax
incentives strategy to attract investors. The opportunity cost of the tax expenditure associated
with the various exemptions also had to be weighed against that of other public expenditures,
particularly those addressing important public investment needs. Moreover, the existence of
multiple exemptions created economic distortions and encouraged rent seeking behavior.
Staff stressed the importance of having a coherent, simple, and predictable tax system in
place, and urged the authorities to reach a consensus on clear reform goals which would
support the revenue objectives envisaged in the medium term.
B. Competitiveness
27.
Madagascar’s competitiveness improved significantly in 2004, but there has been
some reversal in recent months. A study undertaken by staff indicates that while the current
level of the real effective exchange rate is below its long-run fundamentals, deviations from
the long-run trend can be explained for the most part by terms of trade, productivity, and

- 17 -

monetary policy shocks.11 Under these circumstances, at its current level, the real effective
exchange rate seems broadly appropriate—a view broadly shared by the authorities.
28.
While Madagascar’s competitive position benefits from low labor costs, other
cost factors and low productivity tend to weaken prospects for the tradable sector. An
important competitiveness advantage for Madagascar comes from the low nominal wages;
but some detailed sector specific indicators show that this advantage is partly eroded when
adjusted for productivity. Non-wage costs such as those related to electricity, transportation,
and communication also appear to be relatively high.12 The government is cognizant of these
problems and has taken measures to improve competitiveness, including the implementation
of an infrastructure program (with donor support). The authorities also intend to promote
diversification of the export base, and stressed that the expansion of the agro-business sector
was a key element of their development strategy.
29.
Staff supported the authorities’ view that the flexible, market-determined
exchange rate should be maintained. The introduction of a new continuous interbank
foreign exchange market in July 2004 has contributed to the stabilization of the exchange rate
in recent months. Staff encouraged the authorities to intervene only in the foreign market to
dampen sharp swings in the exchange rate and to meet the central bank’s objective of net
foreign asset accumulation, consistent with the BCM’s operational guidelines for its
interventions in the foreign exchange market.
30.
Expanding external trade is an integral part of the authorities’ development
agenda. In the past couple of years, the four trade taxes were collapsed into one, the number
of tariff rates was reduced from 7 to 4, and the highest rate was lowered from 33 to
25 percent.13 The authorities have also started to reduce some of the royalties imposed on
selected imported goods (mainly tobacco, alcohol, sugar, and dairy products). Moreover,
Madagascar is currently a member of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA) and it is to become a member of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) by the end of 2005. Despite the differing and potentially conflicting trade regimes,
the authorities expect membership in SADC to open new markets and bring new investment
into Madagascar. Staff argued that efforts to deepen regional integration should be firmly set
within a framework of multilateral liberalization. The authorities are aware of the complexity
of dealing with two different regimes at customs, but on balance held that implementation
would be fairly straightforward.
11

See Chapter II of the Selected Issues Paper for a study on the real effective exchange rate.

12

See Chapter III of the Selected Issues Paper for a study on competitiveness and export
performance.

13

As a result of these changes as well as the effect of the tariff exemptions granted in
September 2003 for a period of two years, the average weighted tariff is estimated to have declined
from 22 percent in 2001 to 13.4 percent in 2004.

- 18 -

31.
Improving governance is a key element of the authorities’ development strategy.
The authorities underlined that the measures recently taken to fight against corruption and
reform public enterprises have contributed to improving the business climate. Increased
transparency and accountability in the conduct of public affairs are also expected to
contribute to raise Madagascar’s attractiveness to investors.
C. Public Expenditure Management
32.
The authorities concurred that strengthening public expenditure management is
needed to enhance the efficacy of the budget to achieve stated policy goals. Measures
implemented with the 2005 finance law include the transfer of the budgetary oversight for the
military wage bill to the Ministry of Finance and the elimination of the emergency spending
procedure. The authorities were of the view that the audit report on the expenditures incurred
through this procedure in 2004, which is being finalized, should also provide useful
recommendations on further ways to avoid future slippages. Furthermore, a committee has
recently been set up within the Ministry of Finance to ensure a better alignment of
expenditure commitments to available resources, while preserving poverty reduction
expenditures. At the same time, the Treasury is looking into ways to strengthen fiscal
reporting by public entities and decentralized government bodies in order to avoid the
recurrence of the expenditure overruns that took place in 2004. The authorities are also in the
process of compiling a single, comprehensive action plan to strengthen the budgetary process
based on the results of the various diagnostic studies on public expenditure management
undertaken in recent years. The plan, which is prepared in consultation with donors, would
cover the entire budget cycle (see Box 3), and aims, inter alia, at improving the alignment of
the budget with PRSP priorities.
33.
The switch to performance budgeting has revealed several weaknesses, which
the authorities are beginning to address. In particular, weak monitoring procedures for
foreign financed investment and the very high number of output indicators (close to 1,500 in
total) complicate the implementation of the different programs. The medium term
expenditure framework (MTEF) should also be strengthened, and integrated in a fully
consistent macroeconomic framework. The authorities concurred with staff on the need to
address these issues in order to ensure that the transition to performance budgeting proceeds
smoothly. In the meantime, they indicated that they would maintain safeguard procedures
and continue to monitor budget execution on a line-item basis.
D. Capacity Building and Data Issues
34.
The authorities agreed with the mission that strengthened administrative
capacity is key to ensure successful implementation of their reform agenda. They
recognized the need to develop a time-bound action plan to enhance administrative capacity
in the areas of public debt management, expenditure execution and control, tax and customs
administration, revenue mobilization, monetary management, and interventions in the foreign
exchange market. Even though Madagascar received Technical Assistance in the past in most
of these areas, including from the Fund (see Appendix I), a lot more remains to be

- 19 -

accomplished. The mission encouraged them to approach their main development partners as
soon as the action plan is finalized, to ensure its implementation is adequately coordinated.
35.
Economic data shortcomings in several areas hamper surveillance. As indicated
in Appendix III, Madagascar’s database remains weak, particularly for the real sector,
government finances, the balance of payments, and social indicators. Madagascar is a
participant in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS), and its metadata are posted
on the Data Standards Bulletin Board. Staff urged the authorities to include all identified
needs in the statistical area in the above mentioned capacity building action plan.
Box 3. Measures to Strengthen Public Expenditure Management
•

•

•
•

Budget preparation: its calendar has been revised starting in 2005 to involve at an
early stage the line ministries in the budgetary discussions and improve the alignment
of the budget with PRSP priorities. The medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF)
will be strengthened to ensure that the medium-term sectoral strategies are set within a
consistent macroeconomic framework.
Budget execution: the quality and fluidity of budget execution is expected to be
improved by the elimination in 2005 of emergency spending procedures, and the
merger of the sub-authorizing officer and appropriations manager activities should
simplify and accelerate the expenditure system. The program budgets will be
rationalized, and their consistency with the PRSP indicators enhanced. Procedures for
monitoring foreign financed investment and reporting requirement for public entities
and decentralized government bodies will be strengthened. Further improvement is
also needed in the areas of cash management, accounting procedures, and treasury
operations, for which technical assistance has been requested.
Internal and external controls: the decree on supporting documentation for
expenditure authorization is being implemented, and the General Finance Inspectorate
is expected to become operational by end-June.
Procurement issues: the implementation decrees for the new procurement code are
expected to be finalized by July 2005.

VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
Madagascar’s recent growth performance is commendable, but major
uncertainties surround the medium-term prospects. Following the 2002 political crisis,
economic activity has rebounded in 2003-04. However, sustaining growth rates consistent
with achieving the Millennium Development Goals will require the implementation of
macroeconomic and structural policies that preserve competitiveness, strengthen governance,
and attract private investment.
37.
Inflation increased throughout 2004 and remains a key concern for 2005. The
7 percent year-on-year inflation target for end-2005 is achievable, but this will depend on the
evolution of the world prices of oil and rice, as well as the steadfast and timely
implementation of the envisaged tight monetary and fiscal policies. Recent measures to

- 20 -

improve the coordination within the Ministry of Finance and between the Ministry of
Finance and the BCM are welcome.
38.
A coherent and predictable tax policy would help achieve the revenue target. Ad
hoc revisions to the tax and tariff system need to be avoided in the future especially when
such revisions lead to a further erosion of revenue collection, which is low by international
comparison. The uneven success of the EPZ strategy in certain sectors indicates that the
success in attracting investors does not necessarily imply major tax incentives. A more
comprehensive approach, which ensures that reductions in the tax rates are matched by a
broadening of the tax base, seems more appropriate. Achieving the revenue-to-GDP target of
11.4 percent in 2005 appears ambitious and will require the strict and timely implementation
of the envisaged measures.
39.
Public expenditure management needs to be strengthened with donor support.
The fiscal slippages that took place in 2003 and again in 2004 reflect a lack of expenditure
control, especially in the decentralized government entities. Strengthening the budgetary
process is crucial to maintain donor confidence and ensure the effectiveness of the budget as
a poverty-reducing tool, and the authorities’ determination to avoid the recurrence of such
slippages and accelerate the ongoing public expenditure reforms is welcome. The measures
already taken to address the weaknesses identified during the 2004 budget execution,
including a better control of military wages, constitute clear evidence of this determination.
40.
Further steps are needed to strengthen monetary policy implementation and
banking supervision. In particular, there is a strong case for the central bank to use its
monetary policy instruments more effectively and be more proactive in managing liquidity,
especially at a time when inflation needs to be brought under control. In addition, the
authorities could draw on the recommendations of the ongoing FSAP to further strengthen
banking supervision.
41.
The expiration of the ATC in 2005 and the expected end of AGOA III in 2007
reinforce the need to preserve and build on export competitiveness. While the current
level of the real exchange rate is broadly appropriate, structural reforms need to be pursued
aggressively to strengthen competitiveness. Important progress has been made in lowering
external trade barriers, and the authorities are encouraged to deepen regional integration
within a multilateral framework. Moreover, the implementation of the public enterprise
reform agenda needs to be accelerated. While progress has been achieved recently with the
privatization of the state-owned telecommunications and cotton companies, a comprehensive
strategy for the utilities sector is urgently needed, in consultation with the World Bank, as the
weaknesses in the distribution of electricity are among the most frequently mentioned
impediment to the business climate.
42.
Limited capacity continues to hinder the authorities’ ability to implement their
development program. The authorities should finalize their action plan for capacity
building, especially at the Ministry of Finance, the central bank, and the statistical institute in
2005. Moreover, shortcomings in economic and social data hamper policy formulation and

- 21 -

monitoring. A strengthening of the country’s statistical capacity is urgently needed. Fully
coordinated donor support will be key for success in capacity building.
43.
The staff concurs with the conclusion of the EPA report that a successor PRGF
arrangement could assist the country in achieving its poverty reduction goals. A new
program would also help promote private sector led growth, at a time when the economy
remains vulnerable and the level of reserves low. In particular, the experience from past
arrangements points to the need to strengthen the revenue base, improve public expenditure
management, accelerate capacity building efforts, and implement policies that maintain the
country’s competitiveness. The challenges ahead are considerable, but the authorities’
ownership is encouraging, as evidenced by the successful implementation of the PRGF
arrangement that expired in March 2005, the first under which all disbursements scheduled
there under took place.
44.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Madagascar will take place
on the standard 12-month cycle.

VIII. Safeguards Assessments:
Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Central Bank of Madagascar (BCM) is
subject to a safeguards assessment with respect to the PRGF arrangement, which was
approved on March 1, 2001. An off-site safeguards assessment of the BCM, which was
completed on November 21, 2001, identified weaknesses and made appropriate
recommendations, as reported in www.imf.org. These weaknesses are being addressed with
the assistance of MFD; in particular, the BCM complete financial statements for 2003 were
published for the first time in December 2004.

14

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms
at the completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in
NPV terms at the decision point.
15

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point
corresponding to interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not
disbursed during the interim period.

APPENDIX I

Exchange System and Exchange Rate Arrangements:

After April 1982, when the peg to the French franc was discontinued, the exchange rate was
managed with reference to a basket of ten currencies. However, by end-1991, the authorities
ceased the practice of adjusting the exchange rate to offset inflation differentials with key trading
partners. The exchange rate regime is classified as independently floating. Since July, 2004, the
Malagasy franc has been determined through a continuous interbank foreign exchange market
system and on January 1, 2005, the Ariary (AR) replace the Malagasy franc as the country’s
official unit of account, at the rate of AR 1= FMG 5. The exchange rate in terms of the SDR at
end-March 2005 was AR 2,928 = SDR 1.
Madagascar accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4 on September 18,
1996 and maintains no restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions.

X.

Last Article IV Consultation:

Madagascar’s consultation cycle is governed by the decision approved by the Executive
Board on July 15, 2002. This decision stipulates that, subject to certain exceptions, an
Article IV consultation with a member receiving financial assistance under a Fund
arrangement is expected to be completed within 24 months of the conclusion of the previous
Article IV consultation. The 2002 Article IV consultation staff report was discussed by the
Executive Board on December 23, 2002.

APPENDIX II

Madagascar: Relations with the World Bank
(As of April 2005)
Partnership in Madagascar’s Development Strategy
45.
The Government’s poverty reduction strategy (PRSP) was endorsed by the World
Bank and IMF Boards in November 2003. The Strategy outlines a framework for the
Government to redouble its efforts to implement a new generation of economic and social
reforms. The Strategy was developed over three years, starting under the previous
administration and continued by the new Government. The overarching goal of the PRSP is
to cut the poverty rate by half in ten years, from 70 percent in 2003 to 35 percent in 2013. To
reach this objective the Strategy, based on the principle of public private partnership, has
three main axes (i) restoring rule of law and a well governed society; (ii) promoting
economic growth with a large social base, and (iii) promoting systems for establishing human
security and enlarging social protection. Fifteen policy areas and corresponding measures,
proposed outputs and expected outcomes underpin these strategic axes. The main areas are to
improve governance, create a business friendly environment for investment and accelerate
private sector led growth and improve social service delivery to the benefit of its citizens.
The Government prepared its First Annual PRSP Progress Report in July 2004.
46.
In November 2004, the Government articulated a vision up to 2015 Madagascar
Naturellement. While recognizing the enormous potential of Madagascar, this vision puts a
renewed focus on rural development, through the roads program, education and health and
establishing better linkages between the urban and rural areas, and increasing the value added
in agriculture. The vision sees a transformation of Madagascar from a subsistence economy
to a market economy, increased exports, and enhanced linkages between rural economy and
the industrial economy through agro-industries, pharmaceuticals, textiles and the
transformation of mineral products, and through economic services such as tourism and
agricultural credit. The key priorities identified include the reinforcement of the effectiveness
of Government, good governance, infrastructure, education for all, rural development and
environment, drinking water for all, health and AIDS prevention, private sector development,
and tourism. These priorities are formulated as national programs, and there is a strong focus
on integrating donor interventions into the national programs.
47.
A summary of IMF-World Bank collaboration in Madagascar is provided in Table 1.
The IMF leads in supporting Madagascar’s medium-term program for maintaining
macroeconomic stability. In March 2001, the IMF approved a Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF) which expired on March 1, 2005. The goal of the PRGF-supported program
is to support Madagascar's efforts to foster macroeconomic stability, promote accelerated
growth, improve social services, and reduce poverty. It focuses on strong fiscal consolidation
to lower public debt and structural reforms including: (i) monetary policy and financial sector

- 47 -

APPENDIX II

reform; (ii) improvement in tax administration; (iii) restructuring/privatization of public
enterprises; and (iv) trade reforms.
48.
The World Bank leads the policy dialogue in structural and institutional reforms
aimed at: (i) strengthening governance in the public sector; (ii) accelerating pro-poor
economic growth and supporting foreign investment and private sector development; and
(iii) ensuring human development and security, such as in health, education, nutrition and
social protection.
Bank Group Strategy and lending operations
49.
The World Bank’s FY04-06 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Madagascar is
fully aligned to the Government’s program, and refocuses the existing portfolio to better
align itself to the PRSP objectives and to address the key constraints to broad based growth.
In FY04, the Bank approved new projects in transport, environment and governance. The
CAS also reflects a gradual transition from investment to programmatic lending with annual
Poverty Reduction Credits (PRSC) starting in FY05. The first Poverty Reduction Support
Credit (PRSC) addressing governance, education and nutrition was approved in July 2004. A
second PRSC is under preparation and is expected to be presented to the Board in early
FY06, along with an Integrated Growth Poles Project addressing infrastructure and private
sector development. In addition, a repeater project for HIV/AIDS and a health supplemental
credit will also go to the Board at the same time. A watershed management project is under
preparation for later in FY06. Recently completed analytical work such as a Public
Expenditure Review and a Development Policy Review (FY05), financial management and
public procurement reviews, a Rural and Environment Sector Review, a Tourism Study, a
Poverty Assessment Integrated Framework provide the foundation for programmatic lending
and policy dialogue.
50.
As of March 27, 2005, the Bank’s current portfolio consisted of 18 projects with total
commitments of US$ 956.2 million. Of that, a total of US$ 562.1 million had been disbursed
(or approximately 59 percent) and US$ 169.6 million had been disbursed in FY05. Of these
total current commitments, around 47 percent are in infrastructure and transport about
23 percent in rural development and environment, 10 percent in the social sector, 7 percent in
energy and minerals, 6 percent in governance, 5 percent in finance and private sector
development, and 2 percent in multisector HIV AIDS.
IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
Areas where the Bank takes the lead
51.
Areas in which the World Bank takes the lead are related to specific sector advice in
the areas in which the Bank has active lending operations (especially in the social sectors,
infrastructure, agriculture and environment) as well as through a number of analytical studies
as described above. Together with the Government and other donors, the Bank is also

- 48 -

APPENDIX II

involved in supporting aid coordination. This has included mobilizing US$2.3 billion over a
period of four years for Madagascar’s reconstruction and development program financing
following the 2002 crisis, and mobilizing donor support for implementing the Government’s
PRSP and to the Education for All initiative.
Areas in which the IMF takes the lead
8.
Areas where the Fund takes the lead role relate to policy advice and reforms with
respect to (i) overall macroeconomic policies and targets; (ii) tax policy and administration;
(iii) budgetary accounting; (iv) treasury procedures; (v) public sector wage policy; and
(vi) monetary management and exchange rate policy (including the changeover from the
Malagasy franc to the new currency, the Ariary). The Bank team actively participates in
discussions between the Fund and the government in all these areas, however, especially with
respect to the setting of overall macroeconomic targets as well as tax policy.
Areas of Joint Responsibility
9.
IMF and World Bank staff maintain a close working relationship, especially with
respect to (i) monitoring the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper; (ii) reforms set out at the
decision point of the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, which culminated in
Madagascar reaching completion point in October 2004; (iii) analyses and reforms in public
financial management; (iv) other governance reforms, including customs; (v) support of the
privatization program; and (vi) participation in the integrated framework trade initiative.
Joint policy advice between the Bank and the Fund is given on (i) budgetary procedures,
including expenditure execution; (ii) the functioning of internal and external budget control
institutions; and (iii) monitoring and continuation of the privatization program. Table 1
includes a short description of each of the areas and specific support from the two institutions
with respect to policy advice.

APPENDIX III

Madagascar: Statistical Issues
52.
Madagascar’s database remains weak, particularly by the real sector, government
finances, the balance of payments, and social indicators. The authorities are aware of these
deficiencies and are working, with technical assistance from the international community,
including the Fund, to strengthen their statistical system. Madagascar is a participant in the
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS), and its metadata have been posted on the
DSBB as of May 20, 2004. STA balance of payments and monetary and financial statistics
technical assistance missions visited Antananarivo in June and July 2001, respectively.
Following a request by the authorities, a multisector statistics mission was fielded during
February 12-25, 2004.
Real sector
53.
Production of a complete set of national accounts (benchmark data) is infrequent and
depends largely on the availability of source data, whose collection is irregular. The last set
of accounts was produced for 1995 and 1984. For the intermediate years, only estimates of
GDP at current and constant (1984) prices broadly following the 1968 SNA are produced.
These estimates are revised frequently and are considered unreliable, due to the scarcity of
source data, or their inadequate use, and to methodological shortcomings. In particular, the
estimates of the agricultural activities are weak because of the unavailability of suitable
information about the size and the evolution of this sector. Moreover, service activities are
not properly covered and little information is available on the magnitude of the informal
sector. The INSTAT envisages passage to the 1993 SNA by implementing the ERE/TES
software designed for compilation of national accounts and by changing the base year from
1984 to 2001. Significantly, in January 2002, the publication of a quarterly index of
industrial production by export processing zone (EPZ) enterprises was introduced, with
external technical and financial assistance. There are plans to begin developing a quarterly
industrial production index (covering non-EPZ enterprises), should discussions concerning
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) financial assistance be completed early.
54.
A revamped consumer price index (CPI), with weights based on the 1993 household
survey and covering four principal cities, was introduced in July 2000. The CPI is generally
reported to Fund staff on a timely basis. Data on producer prices and nationwide employment
are not available. Various considerations drive the ongoing work on the wholesale price
index (WPI) renewal—the key issue being the relative importance of the commercial
activities in the Malagasy economy. However, the utility of such an indicator is reduced due
to the limited coverage of manufacturing products.
Government finance
55.
The 2004 multisector mission found that data on central government operations are
only disseminated annually, and that data on public debt are not disseminated. It
recommended monthly dissemination of data on central government operations, and

- 51 -

APPENDIX III

quarterly dissemination of data on public debt; as well as monthly reporting of data to STA
for publication in IFS. The mission also found significant gaps in the data coverage of GFS,
and recommended that it be broadened to include public agencies that are part of central
government. Finally, the mission made recommendations concerning classification and
recording of transactions, as well as the calculation of domestic arrears.
56.
The latest government finance statistics (GFS) data reported to STA for publication in
the GFS Yearbook are for 2002 and cover the consolidated central government. However,
many classification problems remain (requiring extensive use of adjustment entries to current
expenditure), and detailed information is missing in the time series since 1996 for budgetary
and nonbudgetary breakdowns and for central government debt. Madagascar does not report
subannual data for publication in International Finance Statistics.
Balance of payments
57.
Since 1984, the Central Bank of Madagascar (BCM) has been in charge of compiling
and disseminating balance of payments statistics, and in 1997 it implemented the fifth edition
of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). However, the current compilation system is
flawed in many respects: the external trade data are derived from customs data, which suffer
from inadequate coverage and deficient recording procedures. Moreover, significant
smuggling activities, particularly related to the mining sector, further reduce the reliability of
recorded trade data. Because the customs processing system has experienced numerous
technical disruptions since 1998, the external trade data have limited serviceability and
require many manual corrections. The current implementation of the ASYCUDA (automated
system for customs data, Version 2.7) was largely completed by mid-2002, with the system
installed in most customs offices. There are plans to further upgrade the customs processing
system to ASYCUDA ++.
58.
The multisector technical assistance mission reviewed the progress made in the
transition to BPM5 and found that the authorities had implemented the surveys to direct
investment enterprises, using an upgraded international transactions reporting system (ITRS),
although the results have yet to be incorporated in the balance of payments. The mission
noted that the compilation system is still hampered by several recurring issues: excessive
processing lags due to partial automation of customs reports; inadequate coverage, for
example, of transactions and debt for the private sector, NGOs, foreign embassies in
Madagascar; and transaction misclassification, e.g., debt relief obtained from multilateral
financial institutions is recorded in current transfers instead of in capital transfers.
59.
In addition, the export processing zones (EPZ) that process goods and reexport to a
third economy are not properly identified within other business services (merchanting and
other trade related services).
60.
The present compilation system offers wide leeway to use available data. This is
exemplified by the c.i.f./f.o.b. correction indicator of 15 percent, which is entirely attributed

- 52 -

APPENDIX III

to freight, while ASYCUDA and port authorities can provide separate data for freight,
insurance and other categories. Data for the service and income accounts rely excessively on
the ITRS reports, whose accuracy is not routinely assessed against other data sources.
61.
As noted by the technical assistance mission in June 2001, the INSTAT and the BCM
adjust differently customs data using different techniques and publish two distinct series of
trade statistics hampering the reliability of Madagascar’s external transactions.
62.
The compilation of external debt statistics is generally satisfactory, and the authorities
are benefiting from technical assistance by the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) in installing the latest version of the Debt Management and
Financial Analysis System (DMFAS). This system is not yet fully operational; some data
entry remains to be completed, and certain DMFAS modules have yet to be installed by
UNCTAD technicians.
Monetary statistics
63.
A STA monetary and financial statistics mission visited Antananarivo in July 2001.
The 2001 mission found that the BCM implemented most of the recommendations of the
1995 monetary and financial statistics mission and further recommended (i) the widening of
statistical coverage to microfinance institutions; (ii) the inclusion of the Savings Bank and
Postal Administration in the “Other Depository Corporations” subsector; and (iii) the
improvement in the timeliness of the BCM’s balance sheet.
64.
Since August 2001, the BCM is reporting monetary data monetary data to STA by email for publication in International Financial Statistics (IFS). After a brief interruption in
data reporting due to the political crisis in 2002, regular data reporting resumed in July 2002.
Data for the monetary authorities and deposit money banks through December 2004 have
been published in the IFS.
65.
The 2004 multisector mission assessed the status of the 2001 mission’s
recommendations and made additional recommendations to improve Madagascar’s monetary
statistics. Assessing the status of the previous recommendations, it found that several
recommendations are pending, such as (i) improvement of the staff and computer resources
of the unit in charge of the monetary statistics compilation; (ii) electronic transmission of
monthly call report forms by the commercial banks to the BCM; and (iii) expansion of broad
money survey to include the microfinance institutions that issue liabilities meeting the
national definition of broad money for Madagascar. Furthermore, the 2004 mission
recommended improvements to the source data and the compilation of statistical
methodology to compile Madagascar’s monetary statistics in accordance with the Fund’s
methodology as described in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manuel (MFSM).

Statement by Damian Ondo Mañe, Executive Director for Republic of Madagascar
June 1, 2005
On behalf of my Malagasy authorities, I would like to express their deep appreciation
to Management and staff for their continued support and policy advice. This close
relationship over the years, sometimes during very difficult times, has been very helpful in
guiding the authorities in their policy decisions, and have contributed much to the progress
made. My Malagasy authorities wish to maintain this close relationship.
Since March 2004, Directors have had 3 occasions to examine economic and
financial developments in Madagascar, in the context of reviews under PRGF arrangements.
In my earlier statements, in particular, that of February 16, 2005, I described developments in
2004. The more recent data do not diverge much from those of February. They indicate
considerable progress, under successive PRGF arrangements, in stabilizing the economy and
laying the foundation for higher growth, but they also show that the economy remains
vulnerable to shocks, and that the economic adjustment programs should be pursued
steadfastly and strengthened in certain areas.
My Malagasy authorities remain fully committed to the reform efforts which have
received strong support from the international community, and for which they are thankful.
In 2004, Madagascar reached the completion point under the HIPC Initiative and is
benefiting from debt relief. The last PRGF arrangement came to a successful conclusion in
March 2005, and my authorities would like to continue the close relationship with the Fund
in the context of a successor PRGF that will focus on raising the growth rate. The continued
vulnerability of the economy to both domestic and external shocks would justify this new
program.
Recent Economic Developments
As I noted above, developments have not diverged much from the February
assessment. They confirm that real GDP growth remains relatively strong at 5.3 percent,
despite a number of exogenous shocks. Most sectors, in particular those of agriculture,
construction, tourism, transport and textiles and garments made strong contribution to
growth, which was also helped by the donor-financed capital expenditure.
Two unfavorable developments were in regard to inflation and the exchange rate.
The Malagasy franc depreciated significantly in 2004 due to larger than expected demand for
foreign currency by private importers in response to the tax and tariff exemptions granted in
September 2003, which have since been partially removed, increased government capital
expenditure and lower vanilla exports due to the cyclones. Higher world price of oil and rice
contributed both to the depreciation and the higher inflation. Weakness in the foreign
exchange market and at the central bank were also factors in the depreciation of the currency.
A number of strong measures, under the advice of Fund staff, were put in place in the second
half of 2004, both in regard to the implementation of monetary and exchange rate policy as
well as in regard to structural and administrative measures. The authorities also maintained a

-2tight fiscal policy. In particular, it should be noted that, despite the large increase in prices
and strong pressures to increase wages, the government kept its commitment to the Budget.
It also improved its coordination with the central bank. These have been successful in
containing inflationary pressures and stabilizing the exchange rate. Recent data show that
inflation peaked in February and has since fallen sharply. The authorities are fully
determined to maintain strong policies so as to restore macroeconomic stability.
Monetary policy has remained tight. Net reimbursement by the Treasury to the central
bank enabled an increase in credit to the private sector. The financial sector continued to
strengthen in 2004, with improved profitability and prudential indicators for the banking
sector. The ratio of nonperforming loans to total gross loans fell from 19.6 percent in 2002,
the year of the major political crisis, to 11.4 percent in 2004. While the expansion of credit
has contributed to the fall in the NPL ratio, it should be noted that there has also been major
improvements in maintaining the quality of the loan portfolio. A Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) is underway and the authorities look forward to its conclusion
and recommendations, with a view of strengthening the sector further. The central bank has
also started to implement the recommendations of the Stage One Report of the Safeguards
Assessment with the help of the Monetary and Financial Systems Department of the Fund.
The anti-money laundering legislation adopted in 2004 became operational this year.
In the fiscal sector, revenue performance improved in 2004, on the basis of strong
reform implemented at customs, and reached 10.9 percent of GDP, compared to 10 percent in
2003. Capital outlays were higher than projected due to higher-than-expected foreign
financed investment. Although the current outlays of the central government were within
Budget, insufficient control over expenditure of decentralized governments bodies and public
entities caused some expenditure overruns, which were compensated for by cuts in other
central government outlays. Overall, the fiscal deficit, including grants, was 4.9 percent of
GDP, compared to 4.2 percent in 2003, and the government reduced its domestic debt by
about 2.8 percent of GDP.
In the external sector, exports of clothing, especially to the U.S., under the AGOA,
increased, but export of vanilla fell significantly. Imports saw a major increase, especially of
capital goods, so that the external current account deficit widened to 14 percent of GDP in
2004. The external debt position remains difficult, despite the debt relief obtained under the
HIPC Initiative. At end-2004, the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio was estimated at 202.1, and
will be 169.8 at end-2005. The ratio will fall below the thresholds only with additional
bilateral aid beyond the HIPC Initiative. My authorities continue to make strong efforts to
obtain full HIPC Initiative assistance, and have contacted all non-Paris Club creditors. They
have already signed agreements with some Paris Club members, and are in discussion with
others to obtain additional debt relief.
The program of structural reforms was pursued steadily in 2004, with good progress
in the area of privatization, and in the improvement of the business and legal environment.
Measures to improve governance have also been taken. These should contribute to lower
domestic costs of doing business in Madagascar and also help to attract foreign investors.

-3Medium Term Policies
The objective of the authorities for the medium term is to build on the progress
achieved and put in place policies, consistent with the PRSP, and that will enable
Madagascar to raise its annual growth rate to a higher level, 6 percent or above, which would
help the country to make progress towards the achievement of the MDGs. While structural
policies and investment on infrastructure should help to improve competitiveness and create
more investment opportunities for the private sector, the authorities will also pursue strong
macroeconomic policies aimed at raising government revenue and keeping inflation low. The
authorities expect much from foreign direct investment and donor assistance. In this regard,
the authorities are pleased that Madagascar was the first country selected by the U.S.
Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC). Assistance under the MCC will focus on land
reforms, financial sector development and agricultural.
Efforts to raise government revenue will be pursued, and measures will include a
comprehensive reform of the tax system. The authorities will maintain a tight control over
expenditure, and a number of steps are being taken to strengthen public expenditure
management. Strengthening of governance at customs will remain a priority. Monetary
policy will continue to aim at reducing inflation, while ensuring the financial needs of the
developing private sector are met. To encourage the development of small enterprises, a law
establishing the legal framework for microfinance operations is expected to be approved by
parliament this year. The strengthening of banking supervision and improving the
effectiveness of monetary policy will remain a priority for the monetary authorities.
However, in spite of the extensive reforms being made, the authorities have concerns
about the medium term, in particular, as regards the textile and garments industry, which up
to now have contributed significantly to growth and the creation of employment, and which
will face increase competition with the expiration of the Agreement on textiles and Clothing
and also with the expected termination of the AGOA by 2007. The authorities expect that the
ongoing program of structural reforms will help to diversify the productive base, but this may
take some time to bear results. The development of the tourism industry and agriculture,
among others, are being encouraged, as well as that of other industries, including mining.
The authorities expect substantial increase in regional trade through their adhesion to
COMESA and SADC.
Ex Post Assessment
My Malagasy authorities agree broadly with the ex post assessment paper. Despite
the fact that the political situation, over the past decade, had been unstable, important
progress was made in the area of macroeconomic stabilization, although my authorities
would have preferred that it had not relied so much on expenditure compression. It is true
that revenue mobilization had been less successful than had been anticipated, but it should be
recognized that a large segment of the population lives on less than a dollar a day, and
contribute little to government revenue. Moreover, during the last few years, Madagascar
has been implementing a large reduction in custom tariffs, including in the context of
regional agreement. The country has also suffered from natural shocks such as cyclones,

-4locusts infestation, etc, which have had a severe adverse impact on agricultural production
and export, a main source of revenue. The government has thus experienced a loss of income,
which has not been fully made up through the VAT. Nevertheless, a number of important
reforms have been put in place in tax and custom administration, the issue of corruption is
being addressed forcefully, and additional revenue-increasing measures are being taken. The
revenue-to-GDP ratio is increasing gradually, and my authorities are confident that as
economic activity increases, especially, in view of the reforms undertaken, there will be an
increase in the tax ratio. It is therefore doubtful if a tougher approach, as suggested in the
EPA paper, would have worked.
My Malagasy authorities agree that the structural reform agenda did take some time
to produce results. In the early nineties, program ownership was weak, as reforms were more
or less imposed. The difficulty to build a consensus caused progress to be uneven. However,
as the paper rightly recognizes, structural reforms have been more successful in the past few
years, as there have been a better and broader consultation on the reform measures, with
more flexible conditionality. The linkage with the PRSP, a document that has broad popular
acceptance has also helped. The authorities intend to build on the recent progress to
accelerate the reform process, and create the conditions for the development of a strong
private sector which will be the engine of growth.
However, and more importantly, the difficulty encountered showed that lack of
capacity played an important role in the failure to implement many policy measures. The
inability of the civil service to attract sufficient numbers of skilled staff, due to low very low
salaries, have hindered progress in many sectors, including the judicial system. Madagascar
has made use of technical assistance from the Fund and other multilateral institutions and
donors, but this has not been enough, and often the newly trained personnel left the service.
My authorities are giving full attention to the issue of capacity-building. In this regard, they
are finalizing a time-bound technical assistance plan which will prioritize their needs. The
plan will then be presented to donors and a coordinated deliver process will be put in place.
Finally, as noted in the EPA paper, Madagascar is making good progress in its reform
process, but the economy remains weak and vulnerable. It will continue to require balanceof-payments assistance over the medium term. Without external assistance, it is unlikely that
the MDGs will be achieved. For their part, my Malagasy authorities are fully committed to
continue the adjustment process. They are of the view that Madagascar is at a crossroad, and
that it will be important to build on the progress achieved. They therefore would like to
request continued Fund support in the form of a successor-PRGF arrangement. They also
hope that donors will continue to give the country their full support, and that Madagascar will
benefit from further debt relief assistance.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation
with the Republic of Madagascar
On June 1, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Republic of Madagascar.1
Background
Since the mid-1990s, Madagascar has made significant progress in terms of macroeconomic
stabilization and structural reform. Political stability has been broadly restored following the
disputed 2001 presidential elections and the ensuing political crisis. Since that time, the
authorities have taken measures to reestablish investor confidence and private sector growth
was reinvigorated. Key structural reforms were implemented, albeit with significant delays, in
particular in the area of public enterprise reform and the fight against corruption. However, the
economy remains vulnerable to shocks, including cyclones, and policy slippages. Progress in
domestic revenue mobilization and in strengthening the budget process also remained modest,
reflecting in part the country’s limited institutional capacity. Madagascar reached the completion
point under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative in October 2004.
Macroeconomic developments in 2003 and 2004 were dominated by the sharp depreciation of
the national currency, and rising inflationary pressures, with year-on-year consumer price
inflation reaching 30 percent at end-February 2005. At the same time, the current account
deficit widened considerably in 2004, reflecting the significant decline in the volume of vanilla
exports and the surge in imports following, among other factors, the tax and tariff exemptions
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2granted in 2003. In spite of a disappointing revenue performance and some expenditure
overruns toward the end of the year, the public finances position strengthened in 2004, as the
authorities were able to contain overall expenditures, and particularly wages, in the difficult
context of mounting inflationary pressures.
In the medium term, real GDP growth is expected to average 6 percent per annum and fiscal
consolidation is projected to continue, driven by an improvement of the revenue performance
and modest expenditure increases. The current account position should also improve over the
medium term. While remaining fragile, the external debt position should remain sustainable,
provided the authorities continue to limit new external financing to grants and to highly
concessional loans. There are several risks to this outlook however, especially in the external
sector, where the impact of the expiry of preferential agreements on textiles exports could turn
out to be larger than currently expected.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Malagasy authorities’ greater ownership of economic
policies and consequent improved track record of policy implementation in recent years. They
welcomed Madagascar’s improved growth performance, the authorities’ success in stabilizing
the exchange rate in the second half of 2004, and the strengthening of the external reserve and
debt positions. However, Directors noted that poverty remains prevalent and the external debt
vulnerable, and that major uncertainties surround Madagascar’s medium-term outlook. They
therefore welcomed the authorities’ commitment to contain inflation, preserve Madagascar’s
competitiveness, and gradually build-up official reserves. This commitment, together with
accelerated progress on structural reforms and the assistance of the donor community, will be
crucial for Madagascar to attain macroeconomic stabilization and the Millennium Development
Goals.
Directors stressed that containing inflation, a key macroeconomic objective for 2005, hinges on
the steadfast and timely implementation of the envisaged tight monetary and fiscal policies as
well as on the evolution of the world prices of oil and rice. Directors welcomed the recent
measures taken to improve coordination within the Ministry of Finance and between the Ministry
of Finance and the central bank.
Directors expressed disappointment that Madagascar’s revenue performance remains weak—
reflected in a relatively low revenue-to-GDP ratio—despite prolonged Fund engagement with
the country, substantial technical assistance, and the significant customs reforms implemented.
They attached high priority to a coherent and predictable tax policy that eschews ad hoc tax
exemptions, and to continued strengthening of tax and customs administration. They welcomed
the authorities’ commitment to pursue medium-term, revenue-enhancing policies in the context
of a comprehensive reform of the tax system, and urged the authorities to forge a consensus on
the tax reform’s goals and strategy.
Directors welcomed the measures taken to avoid the recurrence of the spending slippages that
took place in 2003 and 2004, including better control of military wages and the elimination of
emergency spending procedures. They emphasized that further strengthening of public
expenditure management, including better alignment of the budget with the priorities of the

-3PRSP and proper monitoring of how resources freed by the HIPC Initiative are spent, will be
critical for improving the quality and efficiency of public spending. They also encouraged
implementation of a comprehensive civil service reform.
Directors encouraged the central bank to take further steps to improve the effectiveness of
monetary policy, and to be more proactive in managing liquidity. In this regard, they welcomed
the authorities’ intention to implement the recommendations of a recent Fund technical
assistance mission. They also endorsed the authorities’ flexible exchange rate policy, which
limits exchange market intervention to smoothing operations, and agreed that the current
exchange rate appears to be broadly appropriate. Directors commended the recent efforts to
improve the financial system and the progress made in implementing the recommendations of
the safeguards assessment report. They encouraged the authorities to strengthen banking
supervision further, and looked forward to the findings and recommendations of the ongoing
Financial Sector Assessment Program.
Directors stressed that structural reforms are necessary to diversify the export base and
maintain external competitiveness in the period ahead. The expiration of the Agreement on
Textiles and Clothing in 2005 and the expected end of the third-party apparel provision of the
United States’ African Growth and Opportunity Act in 2007 reinforce the importance of
strengthening competitiveness. Directors were therefore encouraged by the recent pick-up in
the pace of structural reform, and urged the authorities to maintain the momentum.
They welcomed the lowering of external trade barriers, and emphasized the need for
complementary measures to promote a competitive business environment, including the
development of a comprehensive strategy for the utilities sector. Land ownership rights and
registration remain critical issues that should be resolved as soon as possible. Directors
welcomed the creation of the anti-corruption bureau, and more generally the government’s
efforts to become more transparent, and urged the authorities to continue to implement
vigorously the anti-corruption reform program.
Directors welcomed Madagascar’s attainment of the completion point under the enhanced HIPC
Initiative in October 2004. They supported the authorities’ efforts to obtain full HIPC assistance
from all creditors, and recommended a prudent borrowing policy and strengthened debt
management to preserve external debt sustainability.
Directors observed that Madagascar’s limited absorptive and institutional capacity has
adversely affected the implementation of structural reforms, and urged the authorities to
address this issue promptly with the help of the international community, including the IMF.
They underscored that shortcomings in economic and social data hamper policy formulation,
implementation, and monitoring. Directors stressed the need to finalize the action plan for
capacity building, especially at the Ministry of Finance, the central bank, and the statistical
institute, in 2005. Directors emphasized that coordinated and steady donor support will be
crucial for the success of the authorities’ capacity-building efforts.
Directors generally agreed with the main findings and recommendations of the ex-post
assessment report. In particular, they concurred that a successor PRGF arrangement could
help Madagascar achieve its poverty reduction goals and make significant progress toward the
attainment of the Millennium Development Goals, at a time when the economy remains

-4vulnerable and foreign reserves fairly low. Among the lessons to be learnt for future program
design, Directors highlighted the importance of structuring conditionality so as to reinforce the
fiscal revenue base, improve public expenditure management, accelerate capacity building
efforts, and implement policies that maintain Madagascar’s competitiveness. It will also be
important to continue to build national ownership of policies through a close dialogue with civil
society. Furthermore, better alignment of technical assistance with policy priorities will be crucial
to improve the effectiveness of such assistance.
