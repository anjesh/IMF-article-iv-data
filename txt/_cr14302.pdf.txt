STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
September 8, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context: Kenya has embarked on major reforms in line with the 2010 constitution. The new
government has started the process of devolution at a fast pace, introducing a reporting
framework that allows for monitoring progress and challenges. Macroeconomic stability in a
market-friendly environment continues attracting the interest of foreign investors. Kenya
placed its first US$2 billion Eurobond at favorable terms, with proceeds to be used to
upgrade power generation and transportation. Promising commercial prospects of oil
discoveries have the potential of providing significant foreign exchange and fiscal resources.
Kenya is actively participating in the integration of East Africa, showing progress in reducing
delays from the port of Mombasa to Kampala and Kigali. Kenyan banks export their
successful business models through East Africa and other countries in the region, while
complying with upgraded prudential regulations. The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK)
maintains proactive financial inclusion policies that have been effective in facilitating access
to credit by small and medium enterprises. Thanks to legal reforms, the Financial Action
Task Force has removed Kenya from its watch list. Recent terrorist attacks and threats have
raised security concerns, especially in coastal areas bordering Somalia.
Outlook and policies: Growth is projected to accelerate to 5.8 percent in 2014/15 on the
back of higher public and private investment and measures to improve the business
environment. The 2014/15 budget aims at rebalancing recurrent and development spending.
Medium-term fiscal policies intend to bring down the debt burden consistent with the East
African Community Monetary Union (EAMU) Protocol convergence criteria. Inflation remains
broadly in check, but rising food prices and rapid credit growth require careful monitoring by
the CBK.
Focus: Discussions centered on the implementation of devolution, in particular on the
enforcement of accountability provisions. Some checks and balances are proving effective,
such as the required Treasury approval of guarantees for county borrowing. However, a
more systematic framework is needed. Staff and the authorities agreed that the scale of
transfers to counties magnified government’s cash management problems that need to be
addressed with the help of the recently introduced Treasury Single Account (TSA). This
would also contribute to more effective monetary operations. Discussions also focused on
the design of the legal framework for natural resource management aimed at ensuring
consistency with public finance management provisions.

BACKGROUND
1.
Kenya is poised to reap the rewards of extensive institutional reforms and prudent
macroeconomic policy in a market-friendly environment. A surge in public investment in
infrastructure; renewed interest of foreign investors in domestic and regional opportunities using
Nairobi as a hub; and lower transaction costs helped by improvements in information technology,
are expected to lift economic activity. Convergence of interbank rates toward the central bank policy
rate, and stability of the market-determined exchange rate reflect a positive impact of
macroeconomic policies on credibility and expectations.
2.
The successful debut Eurobond issuance suggests a promising outlook for Kenya to
further integrate to global financial markets and reach over time emerging market status.
Long-term financing opportunities to the private sector are opening up in the form of project
financing and private equity investment, including for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Kenya
is already taking steps to adapt its policies to rising middle-income-country type challenges.
3.
Kenya’s external buffers and the fiscal plans outlined in the Budget Policy Statement
are consistent with meeting the EAMU convergence criteria by 2021. Kenya’s foreign reserves,
which have continued to increase despite the large current account deficit, appear broadly
adequate. In the immediate horizon, fiscal space should be used to improve security conditions, still
complicated by terrorist threats. In addition, devolution needs to be managed carefully to overcome
transitional problems. In the medium term, decisive action in containing the wage bill and widening
the tax base would further increase the room for much needed priority social and infrastructure
spending.

GROWTH PICKING UP, WITH VULNERABILITIES
4.
Non-agriculture growth has remained robust, but agriculture has stayed subdued
because of poor rains. Manufacturing, transport, and communications supported non-agriculture
growth of 5.1 percent in January-March 2014, compared with 2.0 percent for agriculture in the same
period (Figure 1). However, security concerns following terrorist attacks and threats have hit
tourism. Weather-related food price hikes and higher electricity rates pushed headline inflation
above the upper bound of the inflation target range in recent months (7.7 percent in July; 8.4
percent in August 2014). However, current inflation rates still reflects the one-off impact of higher
VAT rates introduced in September 2013.
5.

Monetary policy has remained focused on the inflation target (5 ± 2.5 percent). The

central bank has kept the policy rate (CBR) unchanged at 8.5 percent since May 2013 consistent with
broadly stable inflation expectations. However, the potential impact of the recent spike in food and
energy prices and rapid credit growth on inflation expectations remains a concern. Money market
interest rates have remained close to the CBR despite the impact on interest rate volatility of the
government’s cash management problems.

The relatively high external current account deficit (7.7 percent in 2013/14) reflects
strong capital-goods imports and a decline in agricultural exports (Figure 2). Sizable imports of
equipment for oil exploration, largely self-financed, respond to an improved outlook for commercial
exploitation of hydrocarbons, with a mute impact on the exchange rate. Service exports to the rest
of the East African Community (EAC) region, in particular transportation services, have continued
accelerating.

7.
Kenya successfully tapped international capital markets with a debut US$2.0 billion
Eurobond. Investors’ confidence translated into favorable terms (see Box 1). Of the proceeds,
US$600 million were used to repay a syndicated loan contracted in 2012 and the remaining will
substitute for domestic financing of energy and infrastructure projects. In addition, the government
signed a loan with China in May 2014 for the construction of the Mombasa-Nairobi standard gauge
railway (US$3.6bn), expected to start in October 2014 and to be implemented in around 5 years.1

Box 1. Kenya’s Debut Eurobond Sale
Kenya successfully issued its debut sovereign bond at the end of June. The US$2.0bn issuance was more
than four times oversubscribed, with a strong response by foreign investors reflecting Kenya’s good debt
1
management practices. Demand from US investors was dominant with a share of 68 percent of total
placement, followed by British investors with 25 percent (see charts below for more details). To spread out
rollover risk, the Eurobond was issued in two tranches: a five-year $500 million bond at a yield of 5.875
percent, and a 10-year $1.5 billion bond at 6.875 percent.

The contract comprises two loans: a 15-year US$2 billion loan from Eximbank China at Libor plus 3.6 percent, and a
20-year US$1.6 billion loan from the Chinese government at 2 percent. The government will repay these obligations
with resources from Kenya Railways dividends and proceeds from the 1.5 percent railway levy on imports already in
place.

Box 1. Kenya’s Debut Eurobond Sale (concluded)
The favorable terms of Kenya’s first-ever Eurobond, the largest so far in Sub-Saharan Africa, reflects
the unique position of Kenya relative to other frontier markets: (a) Nairobi is a recognized hub in an
expanding EAC regional market; (b) the issuance was justified on the basis of new infrastructure projects in
energy, transport, and agriculture that aim at supporting growth in the medium term; (c) sound policies, a
strong tax base and an active market for government securities reflect a fiscal policy framework largely
independent of grants; (d) a conscientious preparation included making difficult decisions such as adapting
legislation and assuming minor liabilities previously in litigation. Following issuance, the bond yield in the
secondary market has declined below comparable securities such as Zambia’s and Ghana’s (see chart below).

8.
The fiscal deficit in 2013/14 remained unchanged from the previous year. This reflects
higher revenue offset by sizeable transfers to counties and a larger-than-envisaged wage bill. On the
other hand, capacity constraints faced by counties during the first year of devolution resulted in low
execution rates of their development budget. Consequently, the general government fiscal balance
is more favorable than that of the central government in 2013/14.2

Devolution was rolled out during FY2013/14 at a fast-track pace (Box 2; Annex I). The
government established the new counties in line with the 2010 Constitution, and introduced a
reporting framework on budget execution by counties through detailed quarterly reports published
by the Office of the Controller of the Budget. However, this fast-track approach has introduced
strains in government’s cash management, inducing interest rate volatility. Moreover, it complicated
teething problems (common to devolution episodes), and the enforcement of the public financial
management (PFM) framework. Other challenges have also emerged and —if left unaddressed—
could negatively affect fiscal sustainability in the medium term, including wage and payroll issues,
debt inherited from previous local authorities, and unfavorable spending composition. The
authorities recognize these challenges, and agree with staff’s concerns. In particular, they are of the
view that revamping the cash management framework and staffing the Intergovernmental Fiscal
Relations Department (which would support capacity building at the county level), are crucial steps
to mitigate the risks involved.

Staff estimates of the general government fiscal balance are based on county fiscal outturns for the first three
quarters.

Box 2. Devolution And Poverty in Kenya
The ongoing roll out of devolution in line with the 2010 constitution provides an important vehicle
to reduce poverty across the counties while fostering improvements in the delivery of key services.
The redistributive impact of fiscal policies at the local level will hinge on fiscal policies that will be
put in place by the 47 newly formed counties and on the efficiency and accountability in the use of
devolved resources.
While the share of Kenya’s population living in poverty decreased in recent years,
considerable differences among counties
remain. Kenya’s 2014 Economic Survey
shows a decline in poverty rate from 46.6
percent in 2005/06 to 45.2 percent in 2009,
with a larger decline in urban areas.1 The
urban poverty ratio in 2009 is estimated to be
33.5 percent (about 3.9 million individuals),
while rural poverty ratio is 50.5 percent, with
about 13.1 million individuals living below the
poverty line.

Box 2. Devolution and Poverty in Kenya (concluded)

Over time, devolution is expected to help
reduce inequality across counties. Reducing
poverty will depend on the efficient use of large
central government transfers at the county level,
with appropriate accountability for spending
allocations and outcomes. Efforts to raise own
revenues at the local level will further increase
room for higher social and infrastructure
spending.

Kenyan banks are expanding by raising domestic credit, providing access to new
borrowers, and increasing operations beyond Kenyan borders. Banks remain sound and
profitable despite a moderate increase in the non-performing loans (NPL)-to-total loans ratio to
5.6 percent in May 2014 (from 4.6 percent a year before). A pick up in credit growth has been
increasingly funded externally, mainly because of a more intensive use of medium-term mostly
concessional foreign currency lines for SME project financing, and increased credit limits by
international banks to their subsidiaries. Financial inclusion continues progressing (Figure 3) with
mobile-banking loans and deposits driven by M-Shwari (7 million customers in its first year of
operations) and higher SME access to credit (Box 3).

Box 3. Impact of Mobile Banking and Financial Inclusion on Welfare
M-Pesa was introduced in 2007 as a means to transfer money via mobile phones. M-Pesa users
deposit money into a “cell phone account”, and use SMS technology for transfers and “on demand”
payments. Thanks to its use of low-cost technology, overall transaction costs have declined as bills
can be paid remotely. Even more importantly, the poor have benefitted the most: M-Pesa reaches
84 percent of population earning less than US$2 a day. Financial access has increased substantially
thanks to M-Pesa: The number of micro accounts in formal financial institutions (deposit accounts
below US$1,200) has increased more than 10 times over the past 10 years.

Human development index improvement
2000-2012

Lower transaction costs, higher financial access, and continuous innovation, with many products
using the mobile payment platform already in place, have an impact on welfare: M-Shwari, a
deposit-lending facility tailored to the poor, has 7 million active customers in over a year of
operations. Kenyan farmers benefit from

FAVORABLE OUTLOOK, BUT WITH RISKS
11.
The outlook is favorable. Rising domestic and foreign investment are expected to boost
economic activity in the short term. The government has embarked on large-scale projects with
large impact on domestic value added, including the construction of the Mombasa-Nairobi railway,
geothermal plants, irrigation projects, and new oil pipelines. A pickup in private investment explains
high credit growth, especially to manufacturing and SMEs. GDP growth is projected to reach 5.8
percent in FY2014/15 from 5.0 percent in the previous year. Over the medium term, public and
private investments are expected to rise further providing an additional boost to economic growth.
Drivers of growth underlying baseline projections include: (a) improved business conditions owing
to the removal of bottlenecks by rising infrastructure investment in energy and transportation; (b)
the expansion of the EAC market thanks to decisive steps towards regional integration; (c) reduced
social strife as a result of devolution; (d) a more dynamic SME sector thanks to financial inclusion; (e)
higher agricultural productivity and reduced medium-term vulnerability of agricultural production to
weather shocks reflecting the implementation of large size irrigation projects. A boost in investor
confidence following the successful Eurobond issuance could further improve the outlook. An
acceleration of regional integration beyond baseline assumptions, marked improvements in security
conditions, and possible new discoveries raising oil, gas and mining potential, could have a large
impact on investors’ sentiment.
12.
Nevertheless, the Kenyan economy remains vulnerable to risks affecting the external
and fiscal positions (see Risk Assessment Matrix). Near-term risks include the potential further
deterioration of security conditions, new weather-related shocks following poor rains, and/or
additional difficulties in implementing devolution that could complicate PFM. Vulnerability to
weather-related shocks would remain high if infrastructure investments in geothermal energy and
irrigation do not progress as planned. Rising private medium-term foreign currency liabilities could
also increase corporate sector vulnerability to sharp movements in the exchange rate. Protracted
slow growth in advanced and emerging economies may also constrain remittances and foreign
demand for Kenyan exports. On the other hand, vulnerability to capital flow reversals appears
limited; excluding the Eurobond, portfolio inflows have been mostly equity-based.

FOSTERING ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION BY
ADDRESSING VULNERABILITIES
13.
Policy discussions focused on the government’s strategy for “Economic
Transformation for Shared Prosperity” in its Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement for 201417. The government’s plan contains measures to entrench devolution, improve the business
environment, and raise investment in key sectors. In order to make this plan sustainable, the
authorities intend to curb fiscal deficits in line with their medium-term debt strategy, complete the
devolution process addressing transition challenges promptly, consolidate macroeconomic stability
by further modernizing their monetary policy framework, and take steps to continue upgrading
capital markets.

A. Fiscal Policy: Making Devolution Work
The central objective of fiscal policy is to maintain gross public debt below Kenya’s strategic ceiling
(40 percent of GDP in present value (PV) terms), consistent with the EAMU convergence criterion (50
percent of GDP in PV terms). After the initial boost in project spending in FY2014/15, the pace of
deficit reduction is consistent with meeting the EAMU convergence criteria by 2021 (ceiling on fiscal
deficit including grants of 3 percent of GDP). In the near term, fiscal policy focuses on rebalancing
current and development expenditure and increasing fiscal space for social programs, while facing
challenges emerging from the ongoing devolution.
14.
The government’s FY2014/15 budget aims at containing recurrent expenditure and at
allocating additional resources to development spending, social programs and security
upgrades. The authorities are of the view, shared by staff, that fiscal discipline will provide an
orderly framework for a successful and sustainable devolution. In the medium term, fiscal
consolidation would help contain external imbalances, while bringing down the net present value of
public debt closer to the government’s medium-term target. Debt is expected to rise in percent of
GDP in the near term mainly because of the Eurobond placement and the large loan from China to
finance the Standard Gauge Railway. However, debt remains sustainable and resilient to standard
shocks (See Debt Sustainability Analysis Annex). The government plans to set up a sinking fund to
build up resources for the eventual repayment of the Eurobond.
15.
The 2014/15 budget incorporates important revenue measures. These measures include
(a) a revision of the Excise and Income Tax Acts (with LEG technical assistance), (b) higher duties on
iron and steel products, (c) improved tax administration, especially in the case of VAT (by
implementing LEG and FAD recommendations), and (d) amendments to the Income Tax Act to
address tax avoidance by multinationals. Expected higher revenue will also reflect the full-year
effects of VAT reforms introduced in September 2013, as well as the impact of adopted measures to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 15

KENYA

incorporate landlords into the tax base.3 The authorities expect the measures to yield about
1.3 percent of GDP in 2014/15. Staff supports these efforts to widen the tax base and considers the
expected yields reasonable.
16.
A hiring freeze for this fiscal year and the start of a rationalization process aim at
containing the wage bill. The general government wage bill has been rising in recent years, on
account of higher-than-projected wage spending by counties and increases in the central
government wage bill.4 Staff noted that the rising wage bill is crowding out priority infrastructure
spending (See Figure 4). The authorities agreed and emphasized that the planned payroll audits
would help identify potential sources of savings, and that streamlining allowances would reduce the
observed disparities in gross pay between the private and public sector. The authorities also noted
that, based on the findings of the Salaries and Remuneration Commission, the government had
launched a process of staff rationalization that will also encompass county governments, to be
based on a wage grid that allows comparability with private sector wages. These reforms will be
implemented gradually over time, but with a clear timetable of implementation, and in the context
of a social dialogue to ensure that they are not reversed.

3

Some specific tax reduction measures with a rather limited impact on revenue were also introduced, such as
exempting imports of inputs for the processing and preservation of seeds, and for the generation of wind and solar
energy.
4

The 2013/14 initial Budget envisaged a lower central government wage bill on account of cost savings related to
the staff that were devolved to counties. However, this was more than offset by salary increases and additional
recruitment at the central government level in the course of the year.

The authorities consider poverty reduction a key priority. Despite Kenya’s generally
better social indicators relative to Sub-Saharan Africa’s averages (see Text Table), and
notwithstanding the progress made in recent years towards reducing poverty, significant challenges
remain. To this end, the 2014/15 budget accomodates additional resources for social programs that

The authorities give high priority
to accelerating development expenditure. The initiation of large projects is to be complemented
by improved absorption capacity, especially in geo-thermal power generation, and by a
recomposition of counties’ spending to increase the share of development spending. The new
Public Private Partnership framework will be fully in place this fiscal year after the forthcoming
introduction of regulations and the implementation of the framework to assess contigent liabilities,
under preparation with support from the World Bank.
19.
The introduction of the TSA will contribute to more efficient cash and debt
management. This was significantly complicated in 2013/14 by the fast rollout of devolution and by
delays in the issuance of the Eurobond relative to original plans. Staff highlighted the importance of
putting in place an effective TSA ensuring a cash management system with clear accountability,
closely coordinated with debt management functions. The authorities recognize the cash
management challenges and are keen on addressing them.Other budget measures aiming at
improving efficiency include the introduction of the procurement module of the Integrated Financial
Management and Information System (IFMIS) to help reduce the risk of inflated prices in public
contracts, and the creation of the Digital Government Payment Gateway to link spending with
service delivery online.
20.
The government has identified emerging challenges in the devolution process. The
Controller of the Budget has recommended counties to: (a) make efforts to boost their own revenue
collection; (b) put in place all budget execution systems; (c) have annual financial statements
audited; (d) empower county assemblies; (e) settle payroll management problems between counties
and central government, and (f) fully use IFMIS. Staff recommended, and the authorities agreed, to
introduce other measures including (a) adequately staffing the Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations
Department to make it fully operational; (b) enhancing accountability using the PFM framework; (c)
revising the revenue allocation formula to give more weight to fiscal performance and
accountability; and, (d) properly identifying and verifying county assets and liabilities that were
inherited from former local authorities. Additionally, the authorities reiterated their commitment to
18 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KENYA

enforce the procedures for controlling borrowing by counties. These include the requirement for
counties to obtain government-approved guarantees channelled through the Debt Management
Department of the National Treasury and the Intergovernmental Budget and Economic Council, for
which clear procedures will be established.
21.
The medium-term budget policy statement includes an assessment of specific fiscal
risks. It analyzes fiscal sensitivity to changes in macroeconomic assumptions and identifies risks and
mitigating policies related to public-private partnerships, financial sector stability and, possible
droughts. In this regard, staff stressed the importance of capturing institutional risks, especially
related to devolution (see Box 4). The authorities agreed and noted that they also aim at addressing
contingent liabilities risk emanating from government-owned entities by implementing a
comprehensive reform that reduces the number of entities (from close to 300 to 187) and introduces
a new structure for their operations. To this end, two institutions are to be created: the Government
Investment Corporation in charge of commercial entities and the National and County Agencies
Oversight Office in charge of other agencies. To avoid new fiscal risks, staff noted these institutions’
financial operations should be fully incorporated into the budget.

Liabilities of sub-national governments. The nature and magnitude of existing debt of previous local
authorities has yet to be verified, and is being disputed by some counties, which entails a risk for the central
government. Some counties, such as Nairobi, have inherited some relatively large pending bills that−if not
resolved−may pose risks to fiscal sustainability going forward. New borrowing by counties can only take
place with a guarantee by the central government. The National Treasury is in the process of developing
guidelines on county borrowing, and establishing a database of county financial information to assess the
fiscal capacity of counties and their debt sustainability.
Public Private Partnerships (PPPs). Although the PPP Act was approved only in 2013, some PPPs were
introduced before its approval, mostly in the energy sector. In addition, a list of 47 national-priority PPP
projects have already been identified in various sectors including health, transport, electricity and ports. All
contingent liabilities arising from existing and new PPPs need to be assessed by the Department of Debt
Management of the National Treasury. An assessment framework will be established with technical
assistance from the World Bank.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 19

KENYA

Box 4. Monitoring and Managing Fiscal Risks in Kenya (concluded)
Contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities in Kenya beyond those from PPPs represent an additional fiscal
risk. They include guaranteed loans to various public entities that have reached KSh43.5bn (1 percent of
GDP), of which 15 percent have been called to date.
State corporations. Transfers to SOEs reached KSh354.3bn (8 percent of GDP) in 2013/14, of which 66
percent for development spending. The national government is in the process of reforming parastatals and
other government-owned agencies, including by changing its organizational structure and privatizing some
public enterprises. New laws should not create dual budgets during this process.

Wage bill challenges. Public wages are high and have been rising in recent years, crowding out
social and infrastructure spending. Wage setting by counties could magnify this problem. The
government has embarked on a comprehensive rationalization of the payroll.

22.
The government has initiated institutional and legal reforms for extractive industries.
The Extractive Industry Tax Regime and a new Mining Bill, incorporating inputs from FAD and LEG
technical assistance, are already on the Parliament’s agenda. Recent oil and gas discoveries have
improved prospects for their commercial exploitation (see Box 5). Staff noted that some initiatives
require careful design before being introduced: (a) the planned Sovereign Wealth Fund proposed by
the Task Force on Parastatal Reform appears premature as long as the fiscal position is projected to
remain in deficit, and its eventual introduction would require that provisions are fully consistent with
transparent management rules and resources fully integrated into the budget; and (b) the terms of
sharing of revenues from natural resource exploitation between the central government and
counties should be decided once the volume and expected timespan for the exploitation of
available resources are known. The authorities recognize the validity of these concerns. They
underscored the importance of safeguarding most natural resource revenues for development
purposes, while balancing the need for infrastructure and social spending at the local level to ensure
equitable sharing of natural wealth.

20 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KENYA

Box 5. Managing Natural Resources Wealth
Recent discoveries have showcased Kenya’s oil, gas and mining potential. Tullow, one of the main
investors in oil fields in Kenya, estimates reserves to be well above the 600 millions of barrels of oil equivalent
(mboe), comparable to Equatorial Guinea and the Republic of Congo. If this is confirmed, it could bring Kenya’s
external current account to surplus soon after exploitation starts. Morgan Stanley estimates that the country
could become self-sufficient in oil production within 3-5 years.
Overall, 23 international oil companies are conducting exploration activities in all 44 blocks currently
licensed. Companies have been drilling 15 exploration wells between March 2012 and June 2014, an average
drilling rate of about 7 wells per year (compared to one every two years in the past). Crude oil has been found
in 7 wells (Tullow Oil with Africa Oil as Joint Venture Partner), and natural gas and oil were found in onshore
and offshore blocks (Apache and British Gas Group).
The government plans to undertake reforms of the legal and regulatory framework for natural
resources exploitation to enable Kenya to manage its oil and gas resources in a prudent manner. It is in
the process of redesigning the framework for oil exploration, the model for production sharing contracts, and
the model for terms for natural gas contracts, with FAD and LEG technical assistance. In particular, the
petroleum regulatory and fiscal regime dates from 1986 and is in need of modernization. Also, the productionsharing scheme for oil does not reflect properly costs, prices, and production volumes, and needs to be
revised. New production-sharing terms for gas need to be specified. For the medium term, a full gas-specific
regulatory framework is needed.
The government has also rolled out the Kenya Petroleum Technical Assistance Program (KEPTAP) with World
Bank support, to build capacity across the public sector in a number of areas such as geotechnical data
acquisition, and implementation of environmental, social and health and safety standards.

B. Enhancing Monetary Policy Effectiveness
Monetary policy has been effective in keeping inflation expectations in check, despite food and energy
price shocks in recent months. Monetary operations have kept money markets liquid despite
complications stemming from government’s cash management problems partly related to devolution.
23.
Monetary policy has been consistent with broadly stable inflation expectations. Recent

CBK surveys and a stable yield curve suggest that
inflation expectations remain contained despite recent

inflation expectations. The CBK regards the pick up in
credit growth as a healthy sign of strengthening of the real economy, especially in the
manufacturing sector. Even so, staff recommends that the CBK stands ready to tighten monetary
policy to keep inflation expectations anchored around the mid-point of the target band.

has improved significantly as Kenya’s forecasting model has evolved quickly into a practical guide
for monetary policy Further improvements prior to the eventual adoption of inflation targeting
would include entrenching the forecasting and policy analysis framework into the processes and
structure of the CBK, including establishing a forecasting unit at the Research Department, and
committing to maintain CBK financing of government operations at a minimum, including by using
the existing overdraft strictly to address temporary shortfalls.
26.
Capital inflows, especially to the stock market, have continued, attracted by a stable
macroeconomic environment and a promising regional outlook. These inflows have contributed
to stability in the market-determined exchange rate, with the CBK largely staying out of the foreign
exchange market other than to build reserves gradually in line with its reserve cover target. The
authorities estimate that these inflows are consistent with a minor real exchange rate overvaluation
of about 5 percent. Standard Fund approaches show moderate, albeit a bit larger, deviations from
fundamentals. However, the flexibility of the exchange rate and uncertainties surrounding the
balance of payments data raise doubts about the possibility of a large departure from fundamentals
(see External Stability assessment). The share of foreign investors in the stock exchange’s annual
US$2 billion turnover has remained slightly above 50 percent, while foreign inflows to the bond
market have increased but remain modest partly because of macro-prudential regulations limiting
the term for currency swaps by non-residents to one year or more.

27.
The authorities’ recent introduction of a reference rate for floating interest rate bank
facilities aims at increasing transparency in credit markets. Following the recommendation of a
task force on measures to reduce the cost of borrowing, the government introduced the Kenya Bank
Reference Rate (KBRR) to allow customers to better compare lending rates across banks. The KBRR is
defined as the 60-day average of the CBK policy rate and the 90-day T-bill rate, and is set for 6
months unless market conditions change significantly. Staff noted, however, that its design may lead
to undesirable side effects. In particular, the use of the policy rate in the computation of the KBRR
would put an additional burden on monetary policy decisions as the public could perceive that
lending rates are set by the CBK. Moreover, fixing the reference rate for floating rate loans for six
months would paradoxically act against transparency, as banks would be required to adjust the risk
premium for the same borrowers as market conditions change during the six-month period.

C. Financial Policy: Supporting Banks’ and Capital Markets’ Expansion
Financial policies have facilitated financial inclusion and supported the development of capital
markets. Prudential supervision needs to adapt to challenges arising from this expansion, as reflected
in high credit growth, the incorporation of new users of financial services, and the growing operations
of Kenyan banks abroad.
28.
Kenya’s impressive record on financial sector development may entail new risks in an
environment of high credit growth. Staff noted that rapid financial deepening, while welcome,
may raise risks for financial stability. The authorities concurred that credit growth had accelerated
sharply in lending to manufacturing, real estate, telecommunications, business services and
individuals. They noted, however, that to a large extent, this acceleration on credit growth is
explained by an upward shift in credit demand consistent with the initiation of new projects. On the
other hand, NPLs have increased only moderately, especially in sectors affected by external shocks:
agriculture (bad weather), tourism (lower arrivals), and construction (delays in payments to
contractors). The Banking Supervision Department closely monitors these risks, and regards the
impact of rising NPLs on banks’ financial statements as largely manageable.

Capital requirements have increased as market and operational risks are incorporated
into the prudential framework. Systemic banks have been moving ahead of new regulations,
increasing capital through capital injections or bond issuance. They also have been adopting internal
capital adequacy assessment processes in line with CBK regulations introduced in 2013. Despite
higher capitalization, Kenyan banks have shown higher profitability than their peers in other SSA
countries.
30.
Proactive inclusion policies have been effective. The CBK recently introduced upgraded
credit bureau regulations to facilitate the use of borrowers’ information following a review of recent
experience. Also, a new Microfinance Act allows microfinance institutions to expand their scope of
operations and extends CBK’s prompt corrective action capabilities to the supervision of
microfinance institutions. The CBK also introduced payments system regulations for the provision of
electronic retail transfers, with reference to relevant Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements to
guide the operations of mobile payment service providers.
31.
The authorities concur with the view that cross-border expansion of Kenyan banks has
been largely driven by a follow-your-customer strategy in the region. In addition, opportunities
have opened in markets showing higher potential (South Sudan), while high penetration in Kenya
limits the scope for further expansion. In order to address challenges in this area, the CBK has
established three supervisory colleges to conduct joint assessments of the most important Kenyan
financial groups. Initial discussions on crisis management and banking resolution coordination are
already taking place with other regional supervisors. However, the authorities recognize that
differences in capacity between home and host supervisors, especially those from high risk
jurisdictions, which may translate into information quality problems and delays that would place a

Box 6. Cross-Border Activities of Kenyan Banks
Kenyan banks have expanded throughout East
Africa, becoming dominant players in some markets.
Kenya Commercial Bank, Kenya’s leading financial
institutions, was the first Kenyan bank expanding to
Tanzania in 1997. Today, eleven Kenyan banks with 288
branches operate in the East Africa, including South
Sudan. Kenyan banks have entered East African markets
mainly through subsidiaries. Kenyan banks are currently
exploring opportunities in countries out of East Africa
including DR Congo, Ethiopia, Malawi, Somalia, and
Zambia.

Cross-border expansion of Kenyan banks has been
driven by market considerations. Following customers
is a strong motive for Kenyan banks serving the regional
3,000
corporate sector, in sectors such as agricultural
commodities, manufactured products, and retail trade.
2,500
Risk diversification and greater profit opportunities in
2,000
unexplored markets (South Sudan) also provide
1,500
opportunities to banks serving the retail sector.
Transnational Kenyan bank assets have increased by 35
1,000
percent annually on average since 2011. Cross-border
500
activities of Kenyan banks account for 10-12 percent of
0
their banking operations in terms of assets, loans, and
deposits. Eight subsidiaries in four countries registered
losses, mainly banks at the initial stages of expansion in
markets showing intermediate penetration, such as Uganda.

Kenyan banks are becoming systemically important in the region. East African banking systems other than
Kenya’s are less developed and capitalized, which gives a competitive advantage to Kenyan banks. Kenyan

Supported by reforms, capital markets activity is picking up driven by both foreign
and domestic investors. Stock market capitalization increased by 25 percent in the year up to
March 2014 because of higher valuation, to an equivalent of 40 percent of GDP, with trading driven
by foreign investors. The much larger secondary market for government securities continues being
driven by domestic investors, with institutional investors largely buying to hold. Recent reforms
would continue to support the expansion of capital markets: The recently released capital market
master plan will encourage infrastructure financing and the use of derivatives; the recently
concluded process of demutualization of the stock exchange will facilitate the entry of new players
to the stock exchange; the planned unification of financial regulators under the Financial Service
Authority intends to facilitate coordination to assess cross-over risks; and the automation of
over-the-counter trading of treasury bills would attract new investors to the government securities
market (Figure 6).
33.
Kenya was removed from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) watch list in June
2014. The FATF considered that recent legal and regulatory reforms and the establishment of an
operational Financial Reporting Center merited the removal of Kenya from the list of countries
subject to a monitoring process aimed at addressing AML/CFT deficiencies. The authorities are
encouraged to continue their efforts in effectively implementing the AML/CFT framework to
facilitate the government’s plans to establish Nairobi as a robust international financial center.

D. Transition to Frontier/Emerging Market Status
A successful transition to emerging market status will require continued macroeconomic stability,
improved security, and better quality of data. With Kenya more active in international financial
markets, regulatory bodies need to strengthen monitoring of market, currency and liquidity risks in the
financial and non-financial sectors.
34.
The authorities intend to take measures to upgrade the business environment and
improve security conditions. Their plans include simplifying regulations, rationalizing procedures,
removing barriers to entry, and improving the delivery of government services to business. The
government has announced the establishment of: (a) an investors relations office, (b) a one-stop
investment shop, and (c) the expansion of one-stop public-service centers (Huduma centers) to
lighten the bureaucratic burden on firms. The security modernization program that started last year
includes the expansion of the police force and the upgrade of its equipment.
35.
Compilation and dissemination of economic information is high, but data quality in
some key sectors is low. The authorities are taking steps to address these limitations. One
important step in this regard was the national accounts revision, that lifts nominal GDP by 20-25
percent (Box 7). However, data availability is more limited in other areas, chiefly: (a) key social
indicators are only available for 2005/06 (the year of the last household survey); and, (b) balance of
payments data fail to differentiate short-term from long-term inflows properly (see annex in Staff
Report for the Sixth Review under the ECF). Further areas for improvement include the availability
and timeliness of production indices, labor market information, and the international investment
position, especially private debt information.

Box 7. National Accounts Revision
The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) is revising Kenya’s national accounts for the period
2006-2013. The revision was supported by STA technical assistance under the Enhanced Data Dissemination
Initiative. Release of a full time series consistent with this revision is scheduled for September 2014. Based on
details provided in the KNBS 2014 Economic Survey released in May 2014, estimates used in this report take
into account that:
 The revised 2013 GDP will be higher by about 25 percent than the 2001-based GDP, reaching about
$55bn.;
The revised 2013 per capita GDP would reach about $1,325, closer to middle-income status.



50

The KNBS revision, initiated in
2010, will change the base year
from 2001 to 2009. Because of
improved coverage and upgraded
sources of information, the value
added of agriculture, financial
activities and the informal sector
are being revised upwards, while
more appropriate measurement
result in a reduction in the
contribution of wholesale and
retail trade.

Kenya has also taken important steps to support East African integration. Customs
revenue collection for some EAC members (Rwanda, Uganda) already takes place in Mombasa, with
preliminary indicators showing improved revenue for Uganda and Rwanda. Delays in border posts
are sharply reduced. The government has committed to streamline port services in Mombasa, with
commitment to specific targets by all entities involved.

STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
Kenya’s economy has continued to grow in a broadly stable macroeconomic
environment. Credit to the manufacturing sector has picked up and foreign investor interest is
growing, notably in the extractive industries. However, headline inflation has risen above the upper
band of the inflation range in recent months, and further food price shocks in the context of rapid
credit growth may fuel inflation expectations. The CBK should stand ready to tighten monetary
policy to keep inflation expectations anchored around the mid-point of the target band. The market
determined exchange rate has remained stable. A successful sovereign bond issue and its recent
exit from the FATF’s monitoring process attest to the authorities’ progress in establishing Kenya as a
robust financial center.
38.
Kenya faces a positive outlook, but remains vulnerable to important risks. Domestic
risks related to devolution and security concerns are important, and, if not addressed decisively,
could turn into long-term drags to sustained growth. Kenya remains vulnerable to weather-related
shocks in the short term and to the possibility of a renewed downturn in advanced and emerging
economies.
39.
Maintaining a strong foreign exchange reserves position with exchange rate flexibility
will help cushion the impact of potential shocks. A comfortable foreign reserve buffer will
continue playing a key role in minimizing uncertainty. Likewise, improving liquidity forecasting will
support continued prudent monetary policy, which should stand ready to anticipate changes in
inflation expectations when taking monetary policy decisions.
40.
Kenya’s debt remains sustainable, but rising contingent liabilities are a fiscal risk. It is
important to maintain a prudent fiscal stance consistent with Kenya’s medium-term debt target
while pursuing a shift in the composition of expenditure towards development priorities. Controlling
the wage bill at both national and county level should be a priority. Together with improving the
quality and efficiency of public spending, these policies will be essential to create sufficient fiscal
space for well-targeted social programs and increasing infrastructure investment. Continued efforts
to mobilize domestic revenue are also required to fund these priorities. Reform of
government-owned agencies to reduce contingent liabilities is welcome. Its implementation should
maintain consistency with the overall PFM framework.
41.
Devolution holds great promise for promoting inclusive growth and improving social
conditions for the Kenyan population. Considerable progress has been made during the first year
of the process. However, accountability, compliance with the legal framework and implementation
capacity need to be further strengthened to effectively maximize the benefits of devolved resources,
improve the provision of public services and mitigate fiscal risks. Strengthening capacity-building in

30 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KENYA

public financial management is key to ensure that the high expectations raised by devolution are
met, and underscores the importance of making the Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations Department
fully operational. Priority areas are the adoption of the PFM Act regulations, a formal agreement
between the central government and counties on outstanding liabilities, and stronger oversight on
the use of public resources.
42.
The launching of the Treasury Single Account provides an opportunity to overhaul the
government’s cash management systems. Strengthening cash management will help to avoid
undue pressure on payment flows and interest rates, and reduce borrowing costs for the
government and the private sector. Also, it allows the central bank to focus on their monetary
operations when participating in money markets through monetary operations.
43.
Putting in place an effective natural resource management of recent oil and gas
discoveries will pay high dividends in terms of available foreign exchange and fiscal
resources. Once confirmed to be commercially viable, these findings have the potential to further
accelerate economic growth and reduce drought-related and geopolitical risks. A sound fiscal
framework consistent with the PFM Act, including transparent management rules and the full
integration of these resources into the budget, is required for Kenya to fully realize this potential.
44.
Banks are expanding beyond borders and at the same time facilitating financial
inclusion. Continued efforts in consolidated supervision of systemic groups are needed,
accompanied by cross-border cooperation with regional supervisors in information sharing, joint
prudential oversight and resolution procedures. Domestically, the rapid increase in financial
inclusion has opened up the possibility of extending credit at more affordable rates to small and
medium-sized enterprises. The policy of maintaining an enabling environment, while improving the
prudential framework, has served Kenya well and its experience striking this difficult balance is an
example to LICs and even emerging market countries.
45.
Accelerating the regional integration process will contribute to positive investor
sentiment and the diversification of Kenya’s export base. Commitment to the East African
Monetary Union Protocol’s convergence criteria supports the integration process. Kenya’s role in
reducing shipment delays to neighbor countries enhances the benefits of integration. It is essential
that non-tariff barriers are removed to bring down significantly the cost of doing business in the
region.
46.
Data quality improvement should be given higher priority. Transitioning to emerging
market status will make Kenya subject to more intensive monitoring by private investors, rating
agencies, international banks, and multinational companies. Improved availability of data should be
complemented by upgrading in particular the quality and scope of information on the balance of
payments, social indicators, and the labor market.
47.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation for Kenya takes place within 12
months, subject to the decision on consultation cycles.

Annex I. Devolution: Recent Developments, Transitional
Challenges, and the Medium-Term Outlook
The first year of devolved government has been successful in implementing the basic institutional
framework, in a context of improved transparency. Common teething problems have their roots in
capacity constraints of the counties, transitional issues in establishing adequate coordination between
the two layers of government, and weak accountability at the county level. However, other challenges
that are specific to devolution in Kenya have also emerged and could—if left unaddressed —negatively
affect fiscal sustainability in the medium-term, including (i) devolution related wage bill issues, (ii)
resolution of debt inherited from previous local authorities, (iii) unfavorable composition of spending
and (iii) unclear guidelines on potential county borrowing and contingent liabilities. The staffing of the
Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations Department is crucial in helping to address the observed
challenges, especially through assisting in capacity building at the county level.

A. BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Large transfers to counties show a political will to introduce devolution quickly. County
budgets for FY 2013/14 amount to KSh261bn, or 5.2 percent of Kenya’s GDP (Figure 1).1 Budgets are
financed by equitable share transfers from the national government (74 percent of total county
budgets), conditional grants (1 percent of total), and own-source revenue collections (25 percent of
total). In aggregate, counties have allocated around 63 percent of their budgets to current spending,
and the remaining to development spending.

Counties are entitled to receive a minimum of 15 percent of nationally raised revenues. The current allocation
significantly exceeds this number due to a fast-track approach to devolution. In the medium term, improvement of
own source revenue collection by counties should, in principle, reduce dependency on intergovernmental transfers.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 41

KENYA

2.
Own-source revenue collection was initially low but improved slightly during the third
quarter of FY 2013/14, relative to annual budgeted amounts (Figures 2 and 3). In aggregate,
counties projected that local revenue collections will reach KSh68bn during the current fiscal year.
However, some counties may have initially inflated their local revenue projections to achieve
balanced budgets.2Actual revenue collections amounted to only around KSh19.1bn during the first
three quarters of the fiscal year. However, there has been a noticeable improvement in revenue
collections during the third quarter, owing to greater revenues from single business permits. It is
expected that revenues will reach around KSh24bn at the end of the current fiscal year, registering
an increase from the KSh19.7bn that was collected by the defunct local authorities in 2012/13.

During the first nine months of FY 2013/14, counties experienced an improvement in
their absorption capacity (Figure 4). However, absorption remains low: counties received

Devolution and Planning.

KSh133.3bn during the first three quarters of the fiscal year (KSh110.1bn in national transfers and
the remaining in local revenue collections), but spent only KSh106.6bn, which include wage
spending on devolved staff, initially paid on their behalf by the central government .3 Total spending
is expected to rise to around KSh169bn by the end of the fiscal year, on account of higher current
and development spending (Figure 4). Based on projected transfers and local revenue collections for
the full fiscal year, counties would still accumulate around KSh50bn in bank deposits because of
under-spending (about 1 percent of GDP).

4.
Development spending is far below the envisaged goal of 30 percent of total
expenditure. Lagging development spending is explained by still inadequate procurement systems
and some initial delays in disbursements by the central government. By contrast, during the first
three quarters of FY 2013/14, current spending amounted to 86.1 percent of total county spending
(Figure 5). However, development spending absorption rate has been gradually improving and is
expected to continue improving over time, with the exception of a few large counties facing
structural high costs inherited from the previous local authorities.4
5.
The high current spending by counties consists largely of wages and salaries. Counties
spent more than half of their resources during the first three quarters of 2013/14 on wages,
including wages paid to devolved staff on their behalf by the central government. The high wage bill
reflects a large number of staff inherited from previous local governments, new recruitment by
counties, wage increases, and high salaries of county assembly support staff.

3

An initial delay in the enactment of the County Allocation of Revenue Act (2013) resulted in a delay in the
disbursement of transfers to the counties. Counties are now receiving regular monthly cash disbursements.

Some counties may have spent funds from own-sources revenue without following
legal provisions. In particular, some counties recorded expenditures that were higher than actual
funds released to their accounts, most notably to finance current activities (Figure 6). This implies
that these counties may have spent resources from local revenues without seeking the required
authorization from the Office of the Controller of the Budget.5

7.
Some counties dispute the assumption of existing liabilities from former local
authorities. However, the attorney-general has issued a legal opinion that county governments are
the successors of former local authorities and bear the obligations of the defunct local authorities.
County debt repayments of inherited debt from previous local authorities during the first three
quarters of 2013/14 amounted to around KSh3bn (3 percent of total expenditure). The Transition
Authority is expected to verify assets and quantify all liabilities by end-December 2014.

5

The fact that some counties spent outside of funds released to their operational accounts does not imply an
accumulation of arrears since budgets are on a cash basis.

44 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KENYA

8.
Some devolution-related wage bill issues could have negative fiscal implications on
general government finances. First, counties have embarked on an ambitious hiring process,
potentially duplicating positions of national staff in counties and adding to already large
redundancies. Second, the FAD TA report states that around 4,200 new staff (legislative officials and
county executives) may be added to the 2,600 staff already in place. Third, former local authority
staff and members of county assemblies have awarded themselves substantial wage increases
during 2013/14. All this could create significant pressures on general government finances in the
medium term unless the national government adopts clear wage and remuneration polices and
guidelines ideally in the context of a rationalization program.
9.
Distortions created by the formula for the allocation of resources among counties
need to be addressed. During the first year of implementation, county budgets had already been
adopted before specific functions were transferred to the counties. Moreover, some functions
remained within the national government even though the funds had been transferred to counties.
These distortions result in further pressures on central government finances.
10.
County borrowing should be consistent with the medium-term fiscal framework. At
the moment, borrowing by counties requires government guarantees according to the constitution
and should only be used to finance development projects. The National Treasury is determined to
provide guarantees to counties only after they develop an adequate capacity to monitor their fiscal
risks, with resources being made available in line with the counties’ capacity to repay and debt
sustainability. This approach should be formalized to avoid potential impact on fiscal sustainability if
these guarantees are de-facto called.
11.
Accountability for public resources at counties remains weak. Counties are independent
according to the Constitution, but their policies should be consistent with national government
policies. Current spending includes non-negligible allocations to domestic and foreign travel,
purchase of motor vehicles and MCA allowances to members of the county assemblies with unclear
justification. Accountability in this regard should be strengthened by county assemblies, the Kenya
Audit Office and the Parliament.
12.
The Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations Department could help address transitional
challenges. A first step would be to fully staff the Department as early as possible. Once the
Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations Department is staffed, it will provide fiscal oversight over country
budgets, fiscal reporting and fiscal policy, develop a repository of fiscal data for counties, and help
to improve accountability of counties for public resources. 6 Complementary policy actions would
also cover areas such as wage bill sustainability, composition of spending, legacy debt and potential
borrowing by counties. 7 The National Treasury has proposed a structure to provide financial
oversight of counties.

6

The Public Service Commission has approved recruitment of the top three officials for this department.

7

This role will be especially significant when counties start applying for loan guarantees.

Safeguards Assessments:
An update safeguards assessment of the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) was completed in March 2012
with respect to the augmentation of access under the ECF Arrangement approved on December 9,
2011. The assessment found that the temporary governance gaps of the Board and Audit Committee
identified in the 2011 assessment have been rectified. These oversight bodies have now been fully
restored to support effective discipline and responsibility. The Audit Committee concluded
satisfactorily on its ex-post assessment of the gaps, and the external auditor issued an unqualified
audit opinion for 2011. The assessment recommended adopting an action plan to resolve the large
stock of pending audit recommendations. Aside from amending the CBK Act, almost all
recommendations of the earlier assessment have been implemented on schedule. The authorities
have committed to submit revisions to the CBK Act to the National Assembly. Internal audit has
resumed certifying reconciliations supporting the monetary data reporting to the Fund.
Exchange Rate Arrangement:
Kenya's currency is the Kenyan Shilling. Kenya’s de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating
and its de fact exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The official exchange rate, which is
set at the previous day’s average market rate, applies only to government and governmentguaranteed external debt-service payments and to government imports for which there is a specific
budget allocation. On August 28, 2014, the exchange rate was KSh88.3786=US$1.00.
Kenya accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF Articles of Agreement
with effect from June 30, 1994, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments
and transfers for current international transactions, other than restrictions notified to the Fund under
Decision No. 144 (52/51).
Article IV Consultation:
The last Article IV consultation with Kenya concluded on November 23, 2011. The next Article IV
consultation with Kenya is expected to take place on a 12-month cycle,

STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
(as of July 31, 2014)

I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision has some shortcomings because of capacity constraints, but is broadly
adequate for surveillance and program monitoring. Although the overall quality, timeliness and
coverage of macroeconomic statistics have improved over the past few years, further improvements
in the methodology of compiling real, fiscal, and external sector statistics would be desirable in order
to facilitate enhanced design and monitoring of economic policies.
National Accounts: The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) has made significant efforts to
enhance national statistics compilation. Limited funding for data collection activities, a long-term
funding strategy, and a lack of trained staff remain major constraints. The East AFRITAC statistics
advisor is assisting with improving and rebasing the annual and quarterly national accounts
estimates at current and constant (from 2001 to 2009) prices, and developing 2009 supply and use
tables (SUTs) to better anchor the annual GDP estimates, along with other methodological changes.
Improved source data and the balancing of economic flows via the SUTs will result in improved
coverage, more robust estimates, and an expected increase in estimated levels of measured GDP.
The KNBS is participating in the Quarterly National Accounts (QNA) Statistics Module of the IMF-U.K.
Department for International Development (DFID).
Price Statistics: KNBS still faces significant challenges in its compilation of price indices. In
particular, the compilation and dissemination of CPI series at a detailed level with a historical
dimension.
Three East AFRITAC TA missions in 2010— 2013 advised on improvements to all KNBS price
statistics. The KNBS released rebased export and import price indexes (XMPIs) using Customs unit
value trade data in May 2012 (previously compiled on a base year of 1982). Recommendations have
been made for improving the methodology along with proposals for a major rebase, of the
construction price index (currently 1972). The KNBS commenced dissemination of a new quarterly
producer price index for mining and quarrying, manufacturing and utilities from October 2012.
Government Finance Statistics: A GFS TA mission under the GFS Module of the Enhanced Data
Dissemination Initiative (EDDI) project funded by DFID visited Nairobi in October 2011. It identified a
number of shortcomings and made recommendations to address them: set-up a tripartite technical
working group ( MOF, CBK, and KNBS) to determine the institutional coverage of the general
government sector (public sector) and subsectors; disseminate the monthly budget outturn on the
MOF’s website, and report regularly these data to STA for publication in International Financial
Statistics (IFS); reconcile on a regular basis the monthly, quarterly, and annual fiscal statistics;
investigate the causes of the large discrepancy between net lending and financing; compile and
disseminate fiscal statistics for budgetary central government following GFSM 2001 classifications

KENYA

and tables, and gradually expand the coverage to include the major extra-budgetary units and social
security funds; and prepare a migration plan with a detailed timetable for gradual migration to the
GFSM 2001 methodology. An October 2012 follow-up GFS TA mission under the EDDI project found
that some progress had been made implementing the recommendations of the earlier mission and
assisted the authorities to further implement those recommendations.
East AFRITAC (AFE) has begun collaborating closely with the EAC Secretariat to support efforts to
improve compilation and dissemination of GFS based on the Government Finance Statistics Manual
2014 (GFSM 2014) to achieve the fiscal data requirements associated with the East African Monetary
Union (EAMU) Protocol. A series of AFE TA missions are expected to take place to further support
efforts to improve GFS.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Progress has been shown in the compilation of monetary data.
Kenya benefited from participation in the monetary statistics module in Phase II of the DFID Project.
The main objectives of the Project were the adoption of internationally accepted methodologies and
best practices as recommended by the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM) in monetary
data compilation, and establishment of an Integrated Monetary Database (IMD) that meets the
needs of all users on monetary data. However, Kenya’s monetary and financial statistics (MFS) do not
include data on other financial corporations, a growing sector in the country.
Financial sector surveillance: Kenya does not participate in the IMF’s Coordinated Direct
Investment Survey (CDIS) and the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS). Kenya reports 11
core FSIs and 10 encouraged FSIs for deposit takers. Data on the household debt to gross domestic
product ratio is also reported. However, FSIs on other financial corporations and nonfinancial
corporations are not available.
External sector statistics: The KNBS compiles annual balance of payments statistics in Kenya
shillings that are regularly reported to STA. In addition, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) compiles a
complete set of annual balance of payments statistics in U.S. dollars, which are reported to AFR and
used for programming and surveillance purposes. The two datasets are not entirely consistent, and
Fund staff has strongly encouraged the authorities to reconcile them.
Although the overall quality of trade data may be reasonably good, data for other current account
and many financial account transactions are rather weak. The financial account is largely drawn from
the International Transactions Reporting System (ITRS) which suffers from a large and growing
element of unclassified inflows and outflows that might well include settlements of current account
transactions.
Kenya participates in phase II of the external sector module of the DFID Project. Four TA missions
have been conducted under the auspices of this project to undertake a comprehensive enterprise
survey of cross-border financial flows and stocks on an annual basis with a view to significantly
improving the quality of balance of payments and to compile international investment position
statistics.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KENYA

During 2013, the KNBS completed its second Foreign Investment Survey (FIS). It is expected that this
survey could be undertaken on an annual basis.
The KNBS and the CBK analyze the large differences between the results of this survey and the
financial account data disseminated in its balance of payments statistics, obtained from the ITRS, in
order to explain the revisions that are expected to be taken in the balance of payments statistics. The
results could also be used to develop an IIP statement consistent with the revised balance of
payments.

regularly reported for inclusion in the International Financial Statistics (IFS). Monetary data for the
central bank and ODCs are regularly reported for inclusion in the IFS. Annual balance of payments
data, following BPM5 classifications, are regularly reported to STA.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

September 8, 2014

Approved By
Roger Nord and Chris
Lane (IMF) and
John Panzer (IDA)

Prepared by staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association

Kenya’s debt outlook is favorable. Improvements in PV terms since the previous Debt
Sustainability Analysis (DSA), published in 2013, reflect a higher discount rate. Kenya’s risk of
external debt distress remains low, while overall public sector debt dynamics continue to be
sustainable.1 Under the baseline scenario and all the stress tests, Kenya’s external debt burden
indicators do not breach any of the relevant policy-dependent thresholds.

1

The World Bank in 2013 upgraded its classification of Kenya to “strong performer” in terms of the quality of
its policies and institutions as measured by a three-year average of the World Bank’s Country Policy and
Institutional Assessment (CPIA) Index. The relevant indicative thresholds for this category are: 50 percent for
the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio, 200 percent for the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio, 300 percent for the NPV of
debt-to-revenue ratio, 25 percent for the debt service-to-exports ratio, and 22 percent for the debt service-torevenue ratio. These thresholds are applicable to public and publicly guaranteed external debt.

KENYA

BACKGROUND
1.
Kenya’s overall public debt has been stable in recent years. At end-2013, gross public debt
totaled 41 percent of GDP, and has remained stable at around 41–42 percent of GDP since 2010. A little
under half of Kenya’s public debt is owed to external creditors. The DSA consists of two parts: external and
public. The external DSA covers external debt of the central government and the central bank, as well as of
the private sector; stress tests apply to public and publicly guaranteed by the government. The public DSA
covers total debt—external and domestic—incurred or guaranteed by the central government. Public
domestic debt comprises central government debt; government finance statistics are to be expanded to
cover the newly created county governments. In this analysis, total public debt refers to the sum of public
domestic and public external debt, but does not cover the entire public sector (e.g., parastatal borrowing
without a government guarantee is not covered).
2.
Most of Kenya’s external public
debt remains on concessional terms,
but its commercial component is
increasing in 2014 with Kenya’s first
sovereign bond issuance. Nominal public
external debt as at end-2013 was USD 10
billion (text table), equivalent to 18 percent
of GDP—broadly in line with comparable
SSA countries (text chart). Multilateral
creditors continued to account at end2013 for more than 60 percent of external
credit to Kenya. The share of debt from
private creditors is set to increase in 2014,
reflecting Kenya’s successful inaugural

500 million a 10-year bond totaling USD 1.5 billion. Kenya previously obtained commercial debt in 2012
through a two-year syndicated loan of about USD 600 million. In addition, in May 2014 Kenya signed an
agreement with China featuring USD 3.8 billion in semi-concessional loans to finance construction of a
regional railway. The authorities expect these loans to be disbursed over the next four years. Kenya did not
seek debt relief under either the HIPC or MDRI initiatives.

of its maturities over the past two years, rollover
risks remain moderate: the average maturity of Kenya’s domestic debt was 5 years at end-2013, albeit
down from 5.8 years in June 2011.

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
4.

This DSA is based on macroeconomic assumptions that are consistent with the framework

outlined in the Staff Report for the 2014 Article IV consultation. Notable revisions compared with the
April 2013 DSA include (text table):


Real GDP growth is weaker in short term but higher in the long term (Table 2), reflecting
both the short-term impact of lower terms of trade but also sustained higher growth rates in
the services sector.
The primary fiscal deficit is projected to be around 2 percent of GDP wider in the short term
owing largely to significant spending needs associated with devolution. In the medium term,

1

Net domestic debt—gross domestic debt less government deposits at the central bank and at commercial banks,
and government advances to parastatals—was slightly lower, at 21 percent of GDP at end-2013.

the authorities’ commitment to regional integration implies a policy of deficit reduction.1 In
the long term, the primary deficit would be kept close to its previously projected level.


The GDP deflator is projected to be higher in the medium term, reflecting pass-through
from past falls in the terms of trade, though the terms of trade is projected to recover in
subsequent years.



Abstracting from the upward revision of GDP, the projected current account deficit is
substantially wider reflecting larger historical deficits, current imports associated with oil
exploration-related investment, and higher longer-term investment needs. The baseline
does not include recent oil discoveries, pending confirmation that these will be commercially
viable.



The discount rate used to calculate the present value (PV) of external debt, now uses the
unified rate of 5 percent, compared with 3 percent in the previous DSA. As flagged at the
Sixth Review under the ECF (November 2013), the use of the revised (higher) discount rate
results in a more favorable debt profile in PV terms.



Indicative thresholds for debt are higher, owing to Kenya’s improved CPIA rating.

1

The EAC Monetary Union Protocol provides for fiscal convergence criteria including a ceiling on the fiscal deficit
including grants of 3 percent of GDP; and a ceiling on the gross public debt of 50 percent of GDP in net present
value terms. The other macroeconomic convergence criteria include a ceiling on headline inflation (8 percent) and a
floor on reserve cover (4.5 months of imports). The fiscal plans outlined in the authorities’ budget policy statement
are consistent with Kenya meeting the EAC convergence criteria by 2021.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
5.

All external debt indicators remain well below the policy-dependent debt burden thresholds

under the baseline scenario, and no thresholds are breached under any of the standard stress tests.
The main results of the external DSA are the following:


Under the baseline scenario, the debt burden remains sustainable over the 20-year
projection period (Table 1a). As a result of the issuance of the sovereign bond and railwayrelated loan package, the NPV of external debt would rise to 16 percent of GDP at end-2014
and stabilize at 16–17 percent (well below the 50 percent indicative threshold). The NPV of
the debt-to-exports ratio would plateau at 90–95 percent in the medium term, remaining
well under an indicative threshold of 200 percent.



Standard stress tests do not reveal significant vulnerabilities (Table 1b and Figure 1) as
even the shocks with the highest impact would maintain debt levels below the
relevant indicative thresholds. The shock that would have the largest impact on external
debt dynamics results from a one-time 30 percent nominal depreciation of the exchange
rate (similar to the previous DSA) in 2014 and from a permanent shock to the terms of new
public sector loans, increasing the PV of debt to GDP ratio from 17 to 26 percent in 2033,
but still well below the relevant threshold.



The current account balance could improve significantly if recent resource discoveries
are confirmed as profitable. Kenya is currently a net oil importer. However, an oil company
has reported estimated discovered resources of at least 600 million barrels of oil equivalent,
and oil and gas exploration activities are continuing. If recent discoveries are confirmed as
commercially viable, Kenya could become self-sufficient in 3–5 years and a net exporter in
5–10 years. This represents significant upside potential for the medium to long term.

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANAYLISIS
6.
Public debt peaks in 2015 and subsequently remains on a downward trend in the baseline
scenario. In 2014, overall public debt is projected to rise to 45 percent of GDP. The sovereign bond
issuance and railway loan disbursements lift public debt to around 46 percent of GDP in 2015 (Table 2a). In
subsequent years, on the basis of a primary deficit kept to 3 percent of GDP in 2016 and gradually brought
down thereafter, public debt eases below 46 percent of GDP by 2018. In PV terms, the public debt-to-GDP
ratio would remain stable around 41–42 percent through end-2018 (Table 2b), falling thereafter. The PV of
public debt-to-revenue ratio gradually would decline from around 200 percent in 2014–15 to 191 percent
in 2018.
7.
The alternative scenarios and bound tests indicate that the projected paths for all debt
indicators remain under the relevant thresholds (Table 2b and Figure 2). The shock with the highest
negative impact on debt dynamics is real GDP growth one standard deviation below the historical average.

This shock pushes the ratio of PV of debt-to-GDP to 49 percent in 2018 compared with the baseline
41 percent; the PV of debt-to-revenue ratio to 229 percent from 191 percent, and the PV of debt serviceto-revenue ratio to 30 percent from 26 percent by 2018. An unchanged primary balance from 2013 would
have similar results. However, the authorities plan to reduce the primary balance in the medium term,
consistent with the fiscal convergence deficit and debt criteria of the East African Community (EAC)
monetary union.
8.
The devolution process has made concrete progress, but is also presenting challenges that—
if left unaddressed—could have important medium-term fiscal implications. Significant central
government powers were devolved to 47 newly created county governments during the current fiscal year.
Transitional challenges have emerged, as evidenced by capacity constraints at county level and problems in
establishing adequate coordination between the two levels of government. From a general government
perspective, underspending by counties could result in a lower budget deficit in the near term. However,
staff cautions, and the authorities agree, the transitional challenges, together with devolution-related wage
bill issues, the issue of the debt inherited from previous local authorities, and potentially imminent county
borrowing, could—if left unaddressed—hamper efforts to reduce the primary balance in the medium term
(even at the general government level).
9.
Contingent liabilities represent an additional fiscal risk. Contingent liabilities in Kenya include
publicly guaranteed debt of public entities, which reached KSh 43.5 billion (1 percent of GDP) at the end of
2012/13. About 15 percent of this guaranteed debt has been called. Public Private Partnerships (PPPs),
mostly in the energy sector, represent an additional source of contingent liabilities that are yet to be fully
assessed.

MAIN FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
10.
This DSA finds that Kenya continues to face low risk of external debt distress. Institutional
improvements in recent years have increased the safety margin between Kenya’s projected debt and the
related indicative thresholds, though the use of a higher discount rate also contributes significantly to the
more favorable dynamics. Upward revisions to GDP time series are also lowering the ratios of debt to GDP.
11.
Standard stress tests suggest scenarios in which debt would increase, but remain within
sustainable bounds. Exchange rate shocks and less favorable terms on new public sector loans represent
the largest upside risks to external debt. Overall public debt would increase most in the event of
significantly lower than anticipated economic growth. A scenario of this type could be triggered by the
following adverse developments:


a return to drought would reduce agricultural production and hydro-power generation, and
would in turn reduce economic growth, increase food and oil-related imports and lead to a
widening of the current account deficit.



a deterioration in security conditions would weaken earnings from tourism, and dampen FDI
inflows.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KENYA



a protracted slowdown in trading partner growth, in particular, in the euro area, coupled
with declining commodity prices that would lower tourism and main export earnings (e.g.
tea, horticulture and coffee), and reduce remittance and FDI inflows, with a significant
impact on economic growth. However, in the external balances, these effects would be
mitigated by an associated decline in oil prices.



higher global food and fuel prices would raise the import bill and put pressure on the
current account and the exchange rate.

At the same time, Kenya has strong market foundations and long-standing sound macroeconomic
policies—absence of price controls, flexible exchange rate and interest rates, limited budget
subsidies—which give it scope to respond to shocks.
12.
The arrangements for the devolved institutions are only now being tested in practice. The
transitional problems of devolution could translate into fiscal risks for the central government if left
unresolved, potentially affecting this year’s budget outturns and creating pressures for the design of next
year’s budget. This makes it important for the authorities to maintain their efforts to reduce the primary
deficit in the medium term, consistent with meeting the fiscal convergence criteria for the EAC monetary
union.
13.
But natural resource discoveries represent upside potential for the medium to long term. If
confirmed, resource exports could significantly improve Kenya’s external prospects. This puts a premium on
appropriate design for policies to manage Kenya’s natural resources.
14.
The authorities agree with the conclusions of this DSA. They concur that Kenya is at low risk of
external debt distress. They see Kenya’s successful debut sovereign bond issuance in June 2014 as helping
to diversify the country’s funding sources and more broadly as a stepping stone in the path towards
emerging market status. The authorities recognize specific fiscal risks in their medium-term budget policy
statement, and have identified and are seeking to address the emerging challenges in the devolution
process. The government has also initiated institutional and legal reforms for extractive industries.

Includes both public and private sector external debt. For private sector debt, actual for 2010-11 and estimates for 2012-13.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the
baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after
the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV
September 8, 2014

CONSULTATION—EXTERNAL STABILITY ASSESSMENT

Approved By
Roger Nord and
Chris Lane (IMF)

Prepared by the African Department
(In consultation with other departments)

Kenya’s external position is broadly stable: it has built up international reserve buffers, and
external debt appears within sustainable bounds. The current account deficit is large at
around 8 percent of GDP: while this appears to be broadly in line with medium-term
fundamentals after accounting for capital imports, it also suggests continuing vulnerability
to external shocks. The nominal exchange rate is largely market-determined. However, the
real effective exchange rate has appreciated steadily in recent years. Several metrics now
suggest modest real overvaluation, though results should be treated with caution owing to
measurement gaps in external sector and productivity statistics. Measures of nonprice
competitiveness indicate relatively well developed financial markets and flexible prices and
labor markets, but also gaps in infrastructure, health and education, and governance.

RESERVE ADEQUACY
1.
Kenya has been rebuilding its international reserves buffer despite a challenging external
environment. Kenya’s gross international reserves increased from USD 4.3 billion (2.9 months of next
year’s imports) at end-2011 to USD 6.4 billion (3.9 months of next year’s imports) at end-2013 (text chart),
and further to USD 7.5 billion (4.5 months of imports) at end-June 2014 following the successful inaugural
sovereign bond issuance. Despite a challenging external environment—the current account deficit has
been around 9 percent of GDP or more for the past three years, while the terms of trade has declined
steadily—financial inflows to Kenya have been stable at around 10–11 percent of GDP annually. This has
enabled the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) to purchase enough official reserves in the interbank market to
reach its desired minimum reserve coverage of 4 months of imports, even allowing for some sales of FX in
May 2014.
2.
According to traditional rules of thumb, current levels of international reserves appear
adequate:


Reserves of 4–4½ months of next year’s imports are above the standard adequacy threshold
of 3 months.



End-2013 reserves were equivalent to 28 percent of broad money, well above the standard
adequacy threshold of 20 percent.



Although short-term external debt data are not available, the authorities report a lengthy
average time to maturity on external debt, exceeding 11 years, and a high grant element.

3.
The current level of reserves appears broadly appropriate if the cost of holding reserves is
moderate. In a low-income country context, the probability of a drop in absorption—against which a
country should hold reserves—can be estimated using a panel probit regression that includes the
exchange rate regime, fiscal balance, institutional quality, and IMF program status.1 This yields a range of
“optimal” reserves that depends on the cost of holding reserves. In the case of Kenya, current reserve levels
would be close to optimal if the annual cost of holding reserves is around 4 percent per year, and
somewhat more than optimal if the cost of holding reserves is higher (text chart).2 The model suggests that
reserve needs will be higher in the absence of an IMF-supported program. In the short to medium term,
Kenya’s reserve needs are mitigated by its flexible exchange rate regime (below) and its gradual transition
to an inflation targeting framework for monetary policy, subject to risks to balance sheets from a potential

The methodology is outlined in Assessing Reserve Adequacy, IMF Policy Paper, February 2011. Institutional quality is
proxied by the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA).

Follow-up analysis suggests that LICs face a marginal cost of holding reserves of around 4 to 6 percent, but at the
lower end of the range for LICs that have accessed sovereign bond markets. See Assessing Reserve Adequacy—
Further Consideration, IMF Policy Paper, November 2013.

exchange rate adjustment remaining contained.3 In the medium to longer term, Kenya will need to
maintain reserve cover of at least 4.5 months of imports in order to meet the macroeconomic convergence
criteria agreed in the East African Community Monetary Union protocol.

But in the event of a large-scale reversal in portfolio inflows, reserves could fall below
standard adequacy levels. Based on fragmented data sources—including the authorities’ Foreign
Investment Survey for 2011, indirect data from creditors through 2012, and more recent net cash flow data
from the Nairobi Securities Exchange—staff estimates the stock of portfolio liabilities at around USD 2–2.5
billion at end-2013, mainly in equity and investment fund shares. Experience in other sub-Saharan African
countries suggests that episodes of portfolio reversals, when they occur, are nearly equally likely to be small
or large. In a worst-case scenario, loss of the full stock of portfolio liabilities could bring reserves down
below USD 5 billion, or below the standard threshold of 3 months of next year’s imports. An additional
uncertainty is the lack of timely information on private sector external debt.

EXCHANGE RATE ASSESSMENT
5.
Kenya maintains a de facto floating nominal exchange rate regime. The nominal exchange
rate is largely market-determined, although the CBK has been intervening moderately to build up its
reserves buffer. The Kenyan shilling has remained broadly stable against major currencies since 2012,
notwithstanding some largely seasonal fluctuations.

3

Available data for the banking system suggest that dollarization in Kenya is modest, at around 16 percent of
deposits and 24 percent of loans in June 2014. However, limited information is available on other sources of
potentially significant foreign currency exposure; nonbank private external debt data is available only to 2011.

However, Kenya’s real exchange rate has appreciated steadily in recent years. The
CPIbased real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciated by 17½ percent from December 2010 to July 2014
(text chart). Even abstracting from crisis-related volatility in the REER in 2011, this represents a somewhat
faster pace of real appreciation than the trend real appreciation of about 2½ percent annually since 2000.

The recent real appreciation is difficult to explain in terms of improved fundamentals. The
2011 Article IV found that Kenya’s real exchange rate was broadly in line with fundamentals. However, the
subsequent real appreciation has occurred at the same time as a sharp decline in the terms of trade, which
declined by some 18 percent from end-2010 to end-June 2014 (text chart). National accounts data do not
provide evidence of productivity growth above that of trading partners, with the caveat that these data are
now being revised (currently available data may underreport recent growth in the services sector).
Agricultural productivity through 2012 was flat compared with growth in key export competitor countries
(Colombia for coffee, Sri Lanka for tea; text chart). And, with the exception until recently of Zambia, Kenya’s
REER remains relatively appreciated compared with other countries in the region (text chart).

Results from several methodologies differ, though on average they suggest a modest real
overvaluation. The underlying estimates—which range from -1 to 17 percent—need to be treated with
caution (Table 1). The estimates are based on external sector ratios scaled to take into account forthcoming
revisions to the GDP time series.4 Annex I provides further details on the individual approaches.



The macroeconomic balance (MB) approach indicates negligible undervaluation
(1 percent), consistent with the current account deficit—currently wide, but projected to
narrow to 6½ percent of GDP in the medium term—being in line with fundamentals. This
“underlying” current account deficit compares with current account “norms” estimated at
around 6½–7½ percent, which appear plausible given Kenya’s investment needs.



The external sustainability (ES) approach indicates overvaluation of some 9 percent, but is
subject to high uncertainty because of major gaps in data on private external debt and the
international investment position. Pending new data from the authorities—which could
change the results significantly—the available time series estimates for net foreign assets
(NFA) imply lower current account “norms” of around 4¾–5½ percent of GDP consistent
with stabilizing NFA. A norm of 5½ percent would imply a current account gap of around
1½ percentage points of GDP, in contrast to the macroeconomic balance approach. This
result should also be seen in the context of the accompanying Debt Sustainability Analysis
(DSA), which finds that Kenya has a sustainable external debt position and is at low risk of
external debt distress.



The equilibrium REER approach indicates overvaluation of around 10 percent. However,
results from this methodology need to be treated with particular caution, and are excluded
from the overall average. The equilibrium REER result depends heavily on the estimated
productivity differential between Kenya and its trading partners. This differential can be
difficult to measure reliably, but uncertainties are exacerbated pending the release of full
details of the rebased national accounts data. In addition, the estimated equilibrium is
sensitive to changes in government consumption, which could be mismeasured in the
current phase of devolution.

The statistical bureau has flagged an upward revision of 20 percent, with details to be released in September 2014.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND



The purchasing power parity (PPP) approach, in contrast, suggests overvaluation of
17 percent, calculated as the deviation of the current level of the REER from its long-term
historical average.

These results do not imply a need to adjust the nominal exchange rate adjustment—which
has been market-determined—but are suggestive of structural bottlenecks that policymakers
should address. Survey evidence (Section III, below) points to bottlenecks that could be adding to
domestic prices and eroding competitiveness.
10.
Another caveat to these results is the upside potential from resource discoveries. As
discussed in the DSA (¶5), if recent oil and gas discoveries are confirmed as commercially viable, Kenya’s
medium and long-term current account balance could narrow substantially more than the current baseline
indicates. This could reduce the current account gaps and implied exchange rate misalignments under the
MB and ES methodologies, even allowing for an improved current account “norm” under the MB
methodology.

Annex I: Technical Comments on the Exchange Rate
Assessment
Macroeconomic Balance (MB)

The MB methodology estimates the exchange rate misalignment as the current account (CA) “gap”
divided by the CA elasticity, where:
CA gap = “underlying” CA balance minus “norm” CA balance;
Elasticity = percentage point change in the CA balance resulting from a one percentage
point change in the real exchange rate
Results from the MB methodology (Table 2) are only as good as the underlying current account time
series (historical data and projections); the econometric estimates of the CA norm (source: AFR); and
the econometric estimates for export and import elasticity (using from two sources: CGER, and
Tokarick Working Paper WP/10/180).

External Sustainability (ES)
The ES methodology is similar to the MB, except that the CA norm is not estimated econometrically,
but instead is calculated as the CA balance that stabilizes a country’s net foreign assets (NFA) at a
desired benchmark level (set as 2018 projected NFA).
The estimates for Kenya need to be treated with particular caution because the
methodology depends on incomplete data to derive estimates (historical and projected) of
NFA. The Kenyan authorities recently released a Foreign Investment Survey (FIS) for 2011.
However, a FIS has not yet been conducted for 2012 or 2013.



In the absence of more timely official statistics—which could change the results
significantly—time series estimates to 2011 are extended using flow projections for foreign
assets and liabilities, i.e. adding the change in NFA of commercial banks, less public external
debt and net FDI inflows.


Without further adjustment, this methodology implies a CA deficit norm of 4¾ percent of
GDP (Table 3), which is arguably low for a country with Kenya’s investment needs, and well
below the medium-term projected CA deficits of around 6½ percent of GDP.



The FIS data to 2011 strongly confirm the finding of the ECF Sixth Review Staff Report that
the BOP statistics substantially underreport FDI. To adjust for underreporting, the NFA series
beyond 2011 is calculated assuming doubled net FDI inflows compared with official
statistics. The resulting lower benchmark for NFA implies a CA deficit norm of 5½ percent,
which is used to derive the CA gap and resulting estimate of overvaluation.

This method compares the current value of the REER to its long-term average, assuming the REER is
stationary in the long term.
The REER at July 2014 was 17 percent above its average for the previous 10 years (text chart). The
result did not materially change if excluding the 2011 depreciation and its subsequent sharp
unwinding.
The historical deviation is much less—3 percent—if compared to a long-term average around a
secular trend increase (estimated at 3 percent annually). However, such a trend increase could not
be explained by improvements in fundamentals (terms of trade and/or productivity).

Equilibrium REER
The equilibrium REER is estimated using a panel regression using country-specific fixed effects to
obtain coefficients (source: AFR).
The two most important components of the estimate are the country-specific constant, and relative
productivity. The negative productivity differential between Kenya and its partners implies a lower
equilibrium REER.
Overvaluation is calculated as the gap between the current REER and its estimated equilibrium value.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
October 2, 2014

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Kenya
On September, 22, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the 2014 Article IV consultation1 with Kenya.
Kenya’s economy has continued to expand in a stable economic environment. Credit to the
manufacturing sector has picked up and foreign investor interest is growing, notably in the
extractive industries. The economy’s growth rate rose to 5 percent in 2013/14 and is expected to
gain further momentum in 2014/15, driven by higher domestic and external investment. Inflation
remains moderate, but rising food prices and rapid credit growth may fuel inflation expectations.
The relatively high external current account deficit (around 8 percent of Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) in 2013/14) reflects strong capital imports and a decline in agricultural exports. Following
a successful first-time Eurobond issue (US$2 billion) in June 2014, international reserves
reached some four and a half months of prospective import coverage. Kenya’s financial sector
remains robust, the process of financial inclusion is ongoing, and efforts to develop Nairobi into
a regional hub have advanced with Kenya’s recent removal from the Financial Action Task
Force’s watch list.
The 2013/14 central government deficit remained broadly unchanged compared to the previous
year at about 5¾ percent of GDP. A stronger revenue performance was accompanied by a higher
wage bill, rising security spending and the implementation of devolution, which was rolled out at
a fast pace. A new quarterly reporting framework for budget execution by counties will help to
address transitional challenges for public financial management posed by devolution. Kenya’s
debt remains broadly stable and sustainable. The authorities plan a gradual fiscal consolidation
with a view to meeting the medium-term convergence criteria specified in the East African
Community Monetary Union Protocol.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A
staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic
developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board.

DMSDR1S-#5487749-v1-Kenya - 2014 - Article IV Consultation - PRESS RELEASE September 2, 2014 (12:10 PM)

2

Kenya’s medium-term growth prospects are favorable, supported by rising infrastructure
investment in energy and transportation; the expansion of the East African Community market;
deepening financial inclusion, which fosters a more dynamic small and medium-sized enterprise
sector; and the positive impact of large-size irrigation projects on agricultural productivity.
Nonetheless, Kenya remains vulnerable to weather-related shocks, a further deterioration of
security conditions, protracted slow growth in advanced and emerging economies, and
difficulties in implementing devolution that could complicate public financial management.
Executive Board Assessment2
Directors commended the authorities for maintaining macroeconomic stability, introducing
important market-friendly reforms, and for Kenya’s successful debut Eurobond issuance.
Kenya’s economic outlook is favorable, although the country remains vulnerable to exogenous
shocks. To mitigate downside risks, Directors encouraged stronger policy buffers and further
structural reforms, including to strengthen the business climate and improve security conditions.
They noted that this would help to consolidate the gains to date, contribute to poverty reduction,
and promote more inclusive growth.
Directors called for continued commitment to fiscal discipline in the wake of challenges
emerging from the ongoing process of devolution of government responsibilities. This process
should lead to better delivery of services to help alleviate poverty and inequality across counties.
Directors agreed that a prudent fiscal stance, consistent with Kenya’s medium-term debt target,
will create space for much needed infrastructure investment and priority social spending.
Accordingly, Directors supported further revenue mobilization, enhancement of the quality and
efficiency of public spending, and better control over the public wage. They also recommended
full implementation of public financial management reforms, especially with regard to fiscal
devolution and the recent introduction of the Treasury Single Account aimed at strengthening
cash management. They supported the authorities’ efforts to reduce fiscal risks by reforming
government-owned agencies, and closely monitoring contingent liabilities from state-owned
enterprises.
In view of the rise in headline inflation in recent months, Directors encouraged the authorities to
monitor the accelerated pace of credit growth, and to stand ready to tighten monetary conditions
to anchor inflationary expectations. They also recommended strengthening prudential oversight
to prevent a deterioration in the quality of banks’ loan portfolios. Continued efforts to modernize
the monetary framework should also help lay the foundation for inflation targeting.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summing ups can
be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors welcomed the rapid increase in financial inclusion, and the authorities’ strong
commitment to strengthening prudential and regulatory oversight. In light of the rapid expansion
of Kenyan banks in East Africa and other SSA countries, they underscored the need for enhanced
consolidated supervision of transnational banks and other systemic groups. Cross-border
cooperation with regional supervisors in joint prudential oversight would also be important.
Directors commended Kenya’s removal from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)’s
monitoring process and encouraged sustained improvements in the country’s Anti-Money
Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework.
Directors encouraged the authorities to maintain the momentum of structural reforms and to
continue their efforts to remove remaining infrastructure bottlenecks, in order to mitigate
vulnerabilities to weather-related shocks and improve competitiveness. Looking ahead, they also
underscored the need to put in place an effective framework for natural resource management, in
light of recent oil and gas discoveries. While welcoming the ongoing revision of the national
accounts statistics, Directors encouraged the authorities to further improve the quality and the
scope of information on the balance of payments, social conditions, and the labor market.

Statement by M r. Saho, Executive Director for Kenya
September 22, 2014
Macroeconomic stability and growth has gained traction as structural adjustment and
political reforms continue to be deepened in Kenya. This notwithstanding, the authorities
continue to foster economic transformation to address the high poverty levels and youth
unemployment. On behalf of my Kenyan authorities I thank staff for their constructive
engagement with Kenya.
Economic performance and prospects
Although growth is resilient, the economy remains vulnerable to external and internal
risks. Kenya’s economy is projected to grow at a much slower pace than initially
expected due to poor performance in the tourism sector as a result of the security
problems that have threatened tourism with multiple issuances of travel advisories from
major tourist destinations. This is despite various measures announced by the government
to promote domestic tourism earlier in the year. As a result, the authorities have revised
their growth estimates for 2014 to between 5.0-5.5 percent which is lower than the
estimate of 5.8 percent in FY2014/15 budget.
Inflation has remained generally stable in the last two years averaging 6.0 percent.
However, it increased from 7.7 percent in July 2014 to 8.4 percent in August 2014
reflecting base effect and increases in prices of some food and energy items. The Kenyan
shilling is relatively stable against the major foreign currencies supported by foreign
exchange inflows through remittances, increased foreign investor participation in the
Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) and the successful issuance of the debut sovereign
bond. Currently, the foreign reserves are about 4.2 months of import cover.
In FY2013/14 total government revenue surpassed its target with tax income making a
70 percent contribution. There was a noticeable increase in foreign debt mainly because of
borrowing to finance development activities. In the current fiscal year, the authorities
target to increase revenue collection by 15.5 percent, and increase development
expenditure consistent with the objective of rebalancing expenditures towards
development outlays. The authorities have also set a performance benchmark for
absorption of the development budget of at least 80 percent.
The FY2014/15 budget continues implementing the Second Medium Term Plan of the
Vision 2030 whose main theme is “Transforming Kenya: Pathway to Devolution,
Socio-Economic Development, Equity and National Unity”. To push this agenda forward, the
authorities have as their key objectives to enhance the business environment for job
creation; improve productivity and competitiveness in domestic and international
markets; reduce the cost of living; protect the poor and vulnerable; reduce unemployment
among the youth and women; and strengthen devolution.
Fiscal policy and reforms
The authorities are committed to fiscal prudence and debt sustainability. To strengthen
revenue mobilization, efforts are ongoing to deepen tax reforms with a focus on the

2
excise and income taxes to widen the tax base. In addition, to enhance efficiency in tax
administration, as part of the reform initiative under the Revenue Administration Reform
and Modernization Program, the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) has introduced a new
online tax system that allows taxpayers access to various tax administration services such
as updating registration details, filing tax returns, making payments, and monitoring the
status of their tax ledgers. Further, to enhance the capacity of tax administration, the
authorities are in the process of submitting to parliament, the Draft Inland Revenue
Agency Bill and Customs and Border Services Bill to facilitate the reorganization of
KRA. In addition, to rationalize expenditure and assure efficiency and value for money,
the authorities are planning to roll out e-Procurement by making operational Procure-toPay module of the Integrated Financial Management System (IFMIS).
To address the growing wage bill, the authorities have launched the Capacity Assessment
and Rationalization of Public Service (CARPS) initiative. The program aims to have a
leaner, efficient and responsive public service covering both the national and county
levels of government. On September 1, 2014, the biometric registration of civil servants
was launched to verify staff on government payroll and their qualifications, and weed out
ghost workers.
With the enormous development demands, the authorities are diversifying their financing
of development. Recently, they successfully issued a debut sovereign bond to reduce the
crowding out of the private sector in the domestic money market. In addition, the
government has launched the Annuity Financing Mechanism for road development to
provide sustainable means of funding road projects while ensuring faster turnaround in
executions. This model is being pursued for roads that may not be viable for conventional
tolling through public private partnership. It involves engaging a private entity to finance,
design, construct and maintain a road based on an agreed payment modality by the
government. This should take funding pressure away from the government to the private
sector, and also incentivize contractors to improve the quality and efficiency of their
service.
At the same time, the authorities are gearing to implement the parastatal reforms. The
Presidential Task Force on Parastatal Reform has proposed mergers and dissolution of
various parastatals that would reduce the number of parastatals from 262 to 187.
However, to kick start the process two bills have to be passed by parliament; the
Government Owned Entities Bill 2014 which is meant to ensure parastatals adopt a leaner
and more efficient structure; and the National Sovereign Wealth Fund Bill 2014 that
would revamp the government management of its shareholdings in listed companies, and
address issues of managing the new found mineral wealth while also seeking to establish
a wealth fund. These two bills have been published and are awaiting parliamentary
debate.
The devolution process
Despite facing various challenges at the initial stages of implementing a devolved
government system, my authorities are committed to making devolution work. For the
challenges related to the PFM system, the authorities are committed to facilitate the
county governments strengthen their PFM systems so that they can achieve value for

3
money in the use of public resources. In addition, while the Constitution stipulates an
allocation to county governments of not less than 15 percent, in the current financial year
the national government is allocating 43 percent of the most recently audited revenues
approved by parliament to ensure adequate financing of devolved responsibilities.
Furthermore, the Division of Revenue Bill and County Allocation Bill have been
assented to, allowing for timely disbursement of funds to the counties in this fiscal year.
Monetary and financial policies
The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) continues to pursue prudent monetary policy to
compliment fiscal policy in order to maintain price stability. Although overall inflation
has remained above the 7.5 percent upper bound of the prescribed range for the second
consecutive month, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting on September
3, 2014 retained the CBR at 8.5 percent on the basis of the absence of any fundamental
structural pressures on inflation. However, the CBK has undertaken to pursue a
tightening bias in the money market through monetary policy operations to continue
anchoring inflation expectations. It will also keep vigilant on any domestic or external
developments that may impact on price stability and take timely action should shocks
materialize.
To maintain monetary policy credibility, the authorities are committed to modernizing the
monetary policy framework. It is important to note that Kenya is serving as a pilot project
in the IMF project on ‘‘Monetary and Exchange rate policies for LICs” where the IMF is
collaborating closely with the central bank to modernize the practice of monetary policy.
The project has led to the training of CBK staff on Forecasting and Policy Analysis
System (FPAS) which captures the authorities’ views of the monetary transmission
mechanism and shocks impacting on the economy in line with best practices in emerging
markets. CBK is in the process of institutionalizing this framework.
As financial inclusion continues to deepen, efforts are being made to mitigate credit risks
emanating from micro-loans. A mass education campaign has been launched, targeting
the new users of mobile banking micro-loan facility (M-shwari). In addition, micro-loans
issued under the M-Shwari facility are subject to Credit Reference Bureau Regulations,
2013. Section 50 of the Credit Reference Bureau Regulations (issued as Subsidiary
Legislation in January 2014) provides the timeframe during which all non-performing
loans must be reported to the credit bureau for listing.
Starting January 2015, all banks are required to maintain a minimum capital requirement
(Tier II) of 14.5 percent from the current 12 percent. This follows the issuance of revised
guidelines on prudential capital adequacy ratios by CBK in January 2013 to strengthen
the regulatory framework for commercial banks. According to the guidelines, banks are
required to hold a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent over and above the prevailing
minimum ratios. This increases the minimum core capital to risk weighted assets and
total capital to risk weighted assets requirements to 10.5 and 14.5 percent respectively.
The main aim is to enable the institutions withstand future periods of stress. Further, in
the recent Financial Stability Report, CBK has indicated its intentions to raise the
minimum ratios further to make the banking industry move to the level of other markets
in the region such as South Africa and Nigeria.

4
The Kenya Banks’ Reference Rate (KBRR) became effective July 8, 2014. The CBK and
Kenya Bankers Association are monitoring the implementation of the KBRR and the
Annual Percentage Rate (APR) frameworks by commercial banks. So far there are
indications that new and existing loans are benefiting from the KBRR framework. The
average premium that commercial banks charge above the KBRR on commercial
mortgages averaged 3.05 percent while that on corporate loans (1---5 years) was 4.09 percent
by end August. These frameworks are designed to improve transparency in credit
pricing and promote full disclosure of bank charges on new loans thereby supporting an
increase in the supply of affordable credit to support investment.
NSE is now operating as a demutualized entity. This demonstrates commitment to
transparency and good corporate governance.
Enhancing the business environment and regional integration
The authorities are focusing on enhancing the business environment to strengthen
economic activity and create jobs. They have prioritized addressing security challenges.
In this regard, they are building on the security modernization program initiated in the
last financial year to strengthen the security system. They have in the FY2014/15 budget
focused interventions to recruitment and training of police officers, security infrastructure
development, and housing and medical scheme for security personnel. In addition, the
authorities are working to improve productivity and enhance overall competiveness by
investing in transport and logistics networks including, modernizing Jomo Kenyatta
International Airport, improving efficiency of Port of Mombasa, increasing energy
production, and widening the coverage of road networks.
Further, in the context of regional integration various joint infrastructure projects have
been initiated to ease doing business in the East African region. Already Kenya, Uganda
and Rwanda have put in place the singe tourist visa and a single customs territory. A
standard gauge railway from Mombasa to Kigali and Juba through Kampala is being
designed to facilitate regional trade and the financing of the first segment has been
secured. In addition, to improve the efficiency of the Port of Mombasa, the Kenya
National Electronic Single Window System has been launched. Further, the LAPPSET
project that covers Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, South Sudan and Ethiopia is expected to
foster transport links and give the region a competitive edge in global maritime trade.
Conclusion
My authorities value the Fund’s policy advice and technical assistance. Therefore, they
will continue to engage with the Fund and also seek the support of development partners
as they implement their ambitious economic transformation agenda. My authorities are
committed to maintaining macroeconomic stability and deepening structural reforms to
create a favorable business environment that will support strong and inclusive growth
