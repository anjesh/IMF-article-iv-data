EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In response to public discontent about the inability of policies to reduce unemployment, the
authorities have given priority to job creation. While the new labor market initiatives will
facilitate hiring in the near term, important additional reforms are necessary to deliver
appreciably higher employment growth. Nonetheless, the signal to rely less on budgetary
resources to solve labor market problems is helpful, though more decisive and persistent fiscal
adjustment is needed to reduce the high structural budget deficit. With the present outlook of
below-potential near-term growth, it will be difficult to reduce the deficit to less than 3 percent of
GDP. The authorities’ gradual consensus-building approach to structural reform has paid off,
but benefits of coordination between labor and product market reforms, within both France and
the euro area, should be taken advantage of. The financial system appears resilient, and the
supervisory authorities are vigilant about banks’ heightened exposure to the housing sector.
Weakness in the second quarter of 2005 surprised, as hitherto robust domestic demand
faltered, but a moderately-paced recovery is expected. The staff sees GDP growth rising from
1.5 percent in 2005 to about 1.8 percent in 2006. With economic policies emphasizing job
creation and investment, domestic demand should regain poise. Export growth may remain
sluggish though, underscoring the need to preserve competitiveness through structural reforms,
especially given important downside risks from oil prices and trade partner weakness.
Following good progress in 2004, fiscal consolidation stalled in 2005, but it should be resumed
in 2006. Health care reform is helping, but the pace of other social security and local spending
needs to be curtailed. The staff recommends a structural adjustment for 2006 of ½ of
one percentage point of GDP, while the authorities’ plans remain to be clarified. Achieving a
nominal deficit of less than 3 percent of GDP will remain beyond reach, unless growth surprises
on the upside. Over the medium term, through further fiscal adjustment and growth-enhancing
reforms, a small structural surplus should be achieved in preparation for the rise in the fiscal costs
of aging. The authorities viewed their fiscal framework sufficiently robust to deliver
consolidation and saw no need for an independent fiscal council.
While structural reforms are proceeding, faster and broader progress is needed to deal
decisively with the challenges posed by aging and changes in the global economy. Pension and
health care reforms have made inroads toward fiscal sustainability. The new labor contract
represents an innovation, but to achieve appreciable results, it will need to be supported by a
fundamental revamp of labor market institutions and entitlements. Although intent on making
progress, the authorities noted that they would tread carefully to nurture confidence and reform
momentum. Administrative deregulation is proceeding, and it was agreed that further product and
services market deregulation, also in the EU context, would facilitate labor market reform and
enhance its benefits.
The financial system was found to be resilient, with supervisory authorities vigilant about banks’
risk exposure, especially to the housing market. Phasing out of administered savings and
mortgage loan schemes was deemed necessary, though no specific plans were set. The staff urged
France to promote a successful conclusion of the Doha round and welcomed the relatively high
level of official development assistance.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Achieving fiscal sustainability, full employment, and higher trend-growth
remain the key challenges facing the French economy. Economic policies to meet these
challenges have followed the direction of Fund advice, but the pace of implementation and
scope of reform, particularly in the labor market, have been insufficient to achieve decisive
results (Box 1). Nonetheless, pension and health care reforms have made inroads toward
fiscal sustainability, and the recent adoption of a new labor contract signals a novel direction
in reform. Reflecting the authorities’ preference for a gradual approach to preserve social
cohesion, the new initiative is too limited to significantly boost long-term employment
growth, though it is likely to have positive short-run effects in lowering unemployment.
Moreover, its implementation at a time of slowing growth and public discontent with
policies, which culminated in the rejection of the EU constitution treaty, signals the
authorities’ intent to proceed with needed structural reforms.

Box 1. France: Past Fund Policy Recommendations and Implementation
Successive governments have concurred broadly with the direction of the Fund’s economic policy
advice but have underscored the importance of social cohesion, expressed in generous welfare
arrangements and a narrow income distribution. The dialogue with staff on these issues has been
traditionally open and frank.
Fiscal policy: Budgetary execution in 2004 concurred fully with the staff recommendation to use
growth-induced revenue windfalls for fiscal adjustment. However, the Fund’s long-standing advice to
consolidate at an annual pace of 0.5 percent of GDP until structural balance or surplus is achieved
was not followed during 2000–04 on average. The pension reform has appreciably diminished the
projected cost of aging, and health care reform is making inroads, but civil service reform is yet to
start in earnest. The authorities do not see room for sizable expenditure cuts that would permit a
much-needed early reduction in the tax burden.
Labor and product markets: In line with Fund advice, additional flexibility was introduced in labor
markets, especially in the context of the reduction of the workweek to 35 hours. The new employment
contract (contrat nouvelle embauche, CNE) represents a first step to reforming labor market
institutions, but entitlements (other than pensions) remain to be tackled. In product markets,
divestiture has been accelerated and deregulation is ongoing, albeit at a slower pace than advised by
the Fund, and liberalization of trade in services needs new impetus.
Financial sector: In line with Fund advice, the financial sector has been subject to strong
supervision. The authorities have been reluctant to phase out widespread administrative interventions
in financial markets, but some saving schemes have become more market-oriented.
Trade policy: The Fund has called on France to help advance trade liberalization, partly through an
early implementation of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform, now planned for 2007.

II. BACKGROUND
2.
Following a strong year, the economic recovery stalled in early 2005. In 2004,
growth was faster and more consumption-driven than in other large euro-area countries,
though the recovery remained weaker than in the previous cycle (Figures 1 and 2 and

Table 1). Private consumption benefited from a rebound in employment growth (in hours),
increases in the minimum wage, and some fiscal measures, though the overall fiscal stance
was contractionary (Figure 3). A key difference with other euro area countries lay in the
willingness of the French consumer to dip into savings, reflecting more dynamic
demographics, rising financial wealth, and a confidence-preserving execution of pension and
health care reforms. A sound financial sector permitted a rapid expansion of mortgage credit
in support of residential construction. Direct effects on consumption were limited though, as
refinancing is costly and home equity lending nonexistent (Table 2).1 Household
indebtedness, while rising, remains comparatively low (at about 60 percent of GDP). Against
this background, the fall in household consumption in the second quarter of 2005 surprised. It
is most likely related to stagnating employment and the turmoil surrounding the rejection of
the EU constitution treaty.

The authorities and staff find no econometric evidence of a direct impact of house prices on consumption.

3.
Fixed capital formation revived during the upturn but stumbled in the second
quarter of 2005. Strong productivity growth, low interest rates, and subdued wage pressures
strengthened enterprise margins and increased internally-generated funds. Fixed investment
moved up in line with its usual determinants, as elsewhere in the EU (Figure 4), while the
suspension of the taxe professionnelle (an implicitly high marginal tax rate on the profits of
capital-intensive industries) on new investment seems to have contributed only marginally.
Stocks have been behaving somewhat erratically, in part owing to the weight of
developments in specific industries (e.g., aeronautics) but also because of measurement
issues. Their contribution to growth should therefore best be read in conjunction with that of
the external sector.
4.
In contrast with previous cycles and some other euro area countries, the external
sector exerted a drag on growth, raising questions about competitiveness. Cyclical
differences in private domestic demand between France and its key trading partners
(Germany and Italy) explain most of the sudden evaporation of the trade surplus, while fiscal
stimulus in 2002–03 and exchange rate appreciation also played a role (Box 2). Reflecting
these developments, the current account turned into deficit in 2004 for the first time in more
than a decade. Competitiveness does not seem to be an issue at this stage as its recent
deterioration is partly cyclical and has so far only slightly dented the trend improvement that
took place between the late 1980s and 2000. Still, part of the weakness in trade appears
structural and part is unexplained.
5.
The recovery created fewer jobs than usual, and unemployment continued to
rise until recently as enterprises favored increasing hours worked per employee
(Figure 5). To some extent, this mirrors the resilience of employment during the downswing,
reflecting past trend-wage moderation and uncertainty about the strength of the outlook,
factors affecting other countries similarly. However, firms have been reluctant to hire as
minimum wage increases continue to outstrip the growth of low-skilled workers’
productivity, while proposals to raise the flexibility of hiring and firing took time to
materialize. In addition, the reversal of some of the workweek restrictions, while beneficial in
the long run, favors increasing hours over adding workers in the short run. Unemployment
appears to have crested in May 2005 at slightly more than 10 percent of the labor force, one
of the highest levels in the EU but well below historical peaks. Its increase affected
disproportionally the young and the low-skilled. It is too early to draw firm conclusions from
the moderate fall in the unemployment rate in June–July 2005, as salaried employment
stagnated in the second quarter.

Box 2. France: External Competitiveness
After a decade of significant surpluses, France’s trade
balance moved into deficit in 2004 as net trade
contributed negatively to growth for the third year in a
row. Conversely, Germany, for example, posted a
record export performance. While much of this
divergence can be attributed to differences in domestic
and foreign demand, the recent real appreciation of the
exchange rate has adversely affected French exports.
• The evolution of the euro has contributed to an
appreciation of the real effective exchange rate,
but not more than elsewhere. Developments have
been in line with those in Germany and less
worrisome than for Italy.
• Weaker export performance is linked to lower
foreign demand and geographical orientation.
Since 2001, France has faced consistently lower
foreign demand than its large euro area neighbors
and the United Kingdom. Furthermore, its
elasticity of exports to foreign demand, while near
unity, is much smaller than Germany’s, partly
reflecting Germany’s relative specialization in
capital goods, which are more cyclical. The
geographical orientation of French exports is also
structurally less geared toward fast-growing areas,
with a share of exports to the United States and
Asia (excluding Japan) of 11.6 percent in 2004,
compared to 13.7 percent in Italy, 15.9 percent in
Germany, and 22.4 percent in the United
Kingdom.
• Strong domestic demand in France in 2004 led
to buoyant imports. Since 2001, France has had
the most dynamic domestic demand among the
three main euro area countries, exceeding that of
Germany by 2½ percent per year on average
over 2001–04.

Box 2. France: External Competitiveness (Concluded)
Econometric analysis for four European countries points to a significant impact of the euro’s
appreciation on exports, and to a lesser extent on imports.1 During 2001–04, real exchange rate
appreciation in France is estimated to have reduced export growth on a cumulative basis by about
4 percentage points. This is more than in Germany, but less than in Italy, where the cumulative impact
reaches 9 and 16 percentage points, for goods and services exports, respectively. At the same time, in
France, a reduction in export margins mitigated the loss of market share. On the import side, the econometric
analysis confirms the dominant role of domestic demand on import growth in France and in the United
Kingdom; the importance of exports in explaining German imports; and a small boosting effect from the
currency appreciation in all three euro area countries.
Econometric analysis allows to compute by how much, over 2001–04,
the growth of their determinants contributed to the growth of ...

The methodology used in this study does not fully explain recent export developments. For France,
substantial residual weakness in exports (about 6¾ percentage points over 2001–04) remains unexplained,
but it is too early to interpret this as a structural loss in competitiveness. Italy suffers from an even larger
negative residual while Germany seems to be enjoying some unexplained gains, at least for goods. The
United Kingdom appears to have shifted its export specialization from goods toward services.

Slack in the labor market has not resulted in declining inflation, due to mostly
temporary factors. Core and headline inflation have exceeded the euro area average
since 2003, owing to increases in indirect taxation and administered prices, including health
care (Figure 6).2 Energy prices played a key role in pushing up headline inflation but did not
trigger second-round effects. Rents edged up, as they are legally tied to the construction price
index, in turn pulled by a strong housing market. Services provided by unskilled labor
imparted some, albeit marginal cost-push pressures, reflecting higher labor costs in the
context of the workweek reduction. Overall unit labor costs appear well behaved, in part
because of exceptionally strong productivity gains, which may, however, be hard to sustain
(Figure 7).

Policy conditions have been supportive. In 2004, against a background of buoyant
domestic demand, they tightened as the euro appreciated (Figure 8) and the structural fiscal
balance improved considerably (by about 0.8 percentage point of GDP). With growth
weakening, but still projected to exceed the euro area average in 2005, and the euro having
lost some strength, monetary conditions have remained supportive from the perspective of
the French economy. In addition, a key administered interest rate declined by 25 basis points
on August 1, 2005, in accordance with its automatic adjustment formula.3 Initial fiscal plans
for 2005 were for a modest consolidation (0.2 percentage point of GDP), with the automatic
stabilizers being allowed to operate fully on the revenue side.
8.
Potential growth has been subject to opposing forces, which on balance
constitute a drag. The secular decline in labor utilization, mainly due to a fall in hours
worked per person, seems to have ended. Capital utilization has risen, reflecting the lower
relative price of capital and more shift work. Still, these phenomena have been accompanied
by an unexplained trend decline in total factor productivity growth. While aging will reduce
the labor force, recently-observed higher-than-expected fertility and lower mortality indicate
that the impact on potential growth may be less than anticipated. Consequently, without
reforms, annual potential growth is projected to decline moderately from 2.1 percent at
present to 1.9 percent in the medium term and 1.8 percent by 2040.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
9.
Discussions focused on the outlook and the pace of fiscal consolidation and of
structural reform in the context of the authorities’ priority to tackle unemployment.
The authorities saw the lack of confidence expressed in the rejection of the EU constitution
treaty as stemming from fears of unemployment and the failure of past reforms to provide job
security in an era of global change. Hence, they focused on promoting job creation in the

runup to the 2007 elections. They agreed with the staff’s call for broader reform efforts, lest
results remain limited or temporary, but underscored that they would tread carefully to
nurture confidence and reform momentum and thus proceed at a slower pace than advocated
by the staff. Similarly, the authorities emphasized that their approach to fiscal consolidation
would be measured as growth remained fragile. With high deficits and rising public debt, the
staff saw a need for somewhat stronger and more sustained fiscal adjustment.
A. Near-Term Economic Outlook
10.
At the time of the mission, it was agreed that the near-term outlook held
promise, though data released subsequently point to a weaker second quarter than
expected. Industrial output was rising in May, and forward-looking indicators were pointing
to a mild expansion, but first estimates showed GDP growth in the second quarter slowing
unexpectedly to 0.1 percent, quarter-on-quarter. Consequently, the staff lowered its growth
outlook by ¼ of one percentage point in both 2005 and 2006, to 1.5 percent and 2 percent,
respectively, reflecting less robust domestic demand. This projection, which implied
quarterly growth rising to somewhat less than potential, seemed plausible as consumer and
business confidence appeared to be recovering (Figure 9). For households, the July increase
in the SMIC,4 the acceleration of assisted employment programs, and the continuing rise in
wealth should allow private consumption to regain composure. For businesses, the signal of
continuing structural reform should support investment, a point underscored by the
authorities, though the July decline in industrial production does not bode well.
11.
Subsequently, downside risks from oil prices materialized, prompting the staff to
reduce growth projections further, especially in 2006. Oil price assumptions were revised
considerably, in particular for 2006.5 Adverse effects are marginal in 2005, leaving average
GDP growth at 1.5 percent, but are projected to constrain growth to 1.8 percent in 2006.
These estimates take into account indirect effects from lower growth abroad (including the
recent reduction in the U.S. growth outlook) and characteristics of the domestic pass-through
of oil prices, including the dampening effect from the specific nature of part of oil taxation.6
4

The SMIC increased by 3.7 percent in real terms on July 1, 2005. This was the final installment needed to
align the hourly minimum wage with multiple minimum monthly income guarantees. The latter arose from the
staggered adoption of the 35-hour workweek as monthly income was preserved when the workweek was
reduced, thus raising the hourly minimum wage for those who adopted a reduced workweek. Henceforth, there
will be only one minimum wage, indexed to a weighted average of inflation and the average wage, possibly
topped up by a discretionary amount (coup de pouce).
5

They are now $54.23/bbl and $61.75/bbl in 2005 and 2006, respectively, compared to an actual price of
$50.78/bbl in the second quarter of 2005, representing an increase by 7 percent in 2005 and 16.5 percent
in 2006.
6

The staff’s estimated output elasticity of oil prices is such that a 20 percent permanent increase in prices
reduces GDP growth in the current year by 0.1 percentage point and in the following year by 0.2 percentage
point.

12.
In the staff’s view, risks around this lowered baseline are broadly balanced.
Aside from oil prices, there are other external sources of downside risk. The projection relies
on a declining negative contribution of the external sector as demand from trading partners
strengthens. Though this assumption remains to be verified, recent data from Germany and
Italy are encouraging. The authorities felt that the weakness in export performance reflected
mainly the different cyclical positions of demand between France and its key trading
partners, as well as some structural factors such as the regional pattern of trade and product
specialization and that France’s competitiveness position remained sound. However, while
the stabilization of the euro at a less appreciated level would help, there was some concern
that not all of the weakness in exports could be explained. Hence, the authorities agreed that
continuing with structural reforms was also needed to preserve competitiveness going
forward in the face of sharply heightening global competition. They shared staff concerns
that a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances with euro appreciation would slow growth
directly and indirectly, through declines in profits and wealth as France has a net dollar asset
position. The financial sector was not a risk as it seemed fully hedged against exchange risks.
13.
Domestically, risks appeared limited and mostly related to private consumption.
The authorities did not see house prices as a major concern as their wealth effects were small.
Recent price increases had been driven by fundamentals rather than by speculative activity,
and household indebtedness, while rising, was low by international standards. A decline in
house price growth would mainly dampen residential construction activity, which is
prudently projected to slow down in the baseline. In addition, with household savings still
high (and rising again in the second quarter), private consumption could surprise on the
upside, especially if—the authorities emphasized—efforts to boost job creation paid off
rapidly.
14.
Headline inflation is expected to average about 2 percent in the 12 months
ahead, though core inflation will be considerably lower. For inflation, further oil price
increases and health care reforms constitute upward risks, while the reform of regulations
governing distribution margins could increase competition and lower consumer prices
appreciably below baseline. The authorities and staff agreed that it would be important to
avoid second-round effects from energy and regulated price hikes.
B. Fiscal Consolidation Strategy
15.
Fiscal consolidation progressed significantly in 2004, but the general government
deficit remained high, and public debt is rising. The execution of the 2004 budget was
exemplary. By projecting growth realistically, keeping central government spending constant
in real terms, and—in a break with past inclinations to spend revenue windfalls—allocating
all higher-than-expected revenues to deficit reduction, considerable adjustment was achieved
(Table 3). Nonetheless, the deficit, at 3.6 percent of GDP, remained high, and the debt-toGDP ratio reached a historic peak (Figure 10). The staff estimates the structural balance to
have been in a deficit of about 2.6 percent of GDP in 2004.

Fiscal consolidation faltered in 2005, mainly because objectives were
unambitious. Once exceptional one-off operations are excluded,7 there is no structural
adjustment, as modest initial plans (0.2 of one percentage point of GDP) are being scuppered
by a lower-than-projected GDP deflator, which, given the nominal spending approved in the
budget, contributed to raising expenditure to almost 55 percent of GDP (Text Table 1). In
terms of execution, expenditure appears to be broadly on track, especially because health
care reform is keeping spending in line with the targeted deceleration, for the first time in
several years. The authorities felt uncertain about whether they could still achieve an actual
deficit below 3 percent of GDP in 2005, as they did not plan to offset revenue shortfalls due
to weaker-than-expected growth. To limit deficit overruns, the authorities had frozen some
spending at the central government level, while social partners had renounced the
conventional indexation of unemployment benefits. However, the staff projects the actual
deficit to reach about 3.5 percent of GDP in 2005. To stem the increase in debt, the
authorities were accelerating divestiture, which was expected to yield about 1.5 percentage
points of GDP in 2005.

At the time of the mission, the authorities were aiming for a deficit of less than

achieve—especially if growth disappointed, which seems to be the case—because an

exceptional revenue item (the assets of the electricity utility’s pension fund) of almost ½ of
one percentage point of GDP had to be replaced with durable spending restraint. Central
government spending would be kept constant in real terms for the fourth year running—
yielding underlying adjustment of ¼ of one percentage point of GDP—and promised income
tax cuts would be postponed. It was agreed that continued success of the health care reform
and measures to eliminate the deficit of the unemployment insurance system would be
imperative. Over the medium term, these reforms would reduce the deficit by ¾ of
one percentage point of GDP. While the details of the 2006 budget are not yet available—but
will be discussed in a supplement to this report—the authorities wanted to avoid entering
the 2007 elections with a deficit in excess of 3 percent of GDP.
18.
The authorities intended to proceed with fiscal adjustment, though specifics
remained to be elaborated. They observed that the 2003 pension reform had considerably
cut contingent liabilities, reducing the estimated budgetary cost of aging by almost two fifths,
and that the structural deficit was well below 3 percent of GDP (Text Table 2). They agreed

that, without adjustment, the public debt ratio was vulnerable to significant increases, as
brought out by the standard debt sustainability analysis (Table 4 and Figure 11), while in the
long run, the remaining costs of aging still threatened fiscal sustainability (Figure 12, current

through growth-enhancing reforms, some of which would simultaneously reduce budgetary

The current policy scenario reflects fiscal policies as described in Text Table 1 through 2010 and assumes that
structural reforms implemented to date are sufficient to reduce the NAIRU to 7 percent. Beyond 2010, potential
growth declines due to demographics, while the cost of aging rises to the level noted in Text Table 2.

employment and product market reforms, e.g.,
divestiture. Otherwise, upfront adjustment would
need to be larger. Moreover, efforts at
expenditure restraint would need to be broadened beyond the central government.
19.
The staff urged the authorities to proceed with durable expenditure reforms. It
was agreed that health care reform had been effective so far, but that the reform would not
contribute to overall consolidation as the pace of health spending was unlikely to fall below
that of potential GDP. While recognizing that an across-the-board approach to
nonreplacement of retiring civil servants was undesirable, the staff called for more efforts to
utilize the ongoing wave of retirements to help with medium-term consolidation, but political
will appeared to be lacking. The staff emphasized the need to take advantage of synergies
between structural reforms and fiscal adjustment and curb local spending to safeguard the
credibility of the decentralization process. To improve labor market performance, for
example, it would be important to curtail out-of-work benefits and phase out special
retirement regimes. In this context, the staff welcomed the authorities’ recognition that the
avenue of relying on budgetary resources to solve labor market problems had been
exhausted, though implementation of past initiatives (such as the social cohesion plan)
continued to weigh on the budget.

The reform and adjustment scenario assumes, in addition to the current policies scenario assumptions, the
implementation of product and labor market reforms, which raise steady state GDP by about 10 percentage
points (consistent with the GEM simulations of Box 4).

Of about 170,000 civil servants retiring during 2004–06, only 16,800 are not being replaced.

20.
Awareness is building of the need to overhaul the tax system, and some
important tax distortions are being addressed. The distortions involved in the taxe
professionnelle (a tax that falls mainly on capital) are being mitigated by capping the tax as
a percentage of value added at the level of the enterprise while broadening its base. The
authorities agreed that ultimately this tax (which had been suspended for new investments)
should be eliminated, but its large yield prevented them from doing so immediately. More
generally, the authorities recognized the need to phase out tax exemptions and tax credits
(except for the earned income tax credit) and broaden tax bases. They agreed with the staff
that a simplification of the taxation of savings products and a shift in focus of tax incentives
to the promotion of retirement savings would benefit the budget and the economy’s
efficiency.
21.
The authorities noted that their fiscal framework was being strengthened and
saw no need for an independent fiscal council. For the central government, a new organic
budget law, in effect with the 2006 budget, had increased the oversight role of parliament,
heightened the accountability of spending agents, and enhanced the assessment role of the
Cour des Comptes (the independent audit office). A similar organic budget law is set to be
adopted for social security, while for health care spending, a watchdog is in place with the
formal powers to ask parliament to adopt corrective measures. The unemployment insurance
system is run by social partners and designed to be in balance in the medium term. The
authorities argued that under the (modified) SGP, the independent assessment of the EU was
a strong safeguard. The staff responded that more national ownership of budgetary analysis
through independent forward-looking assessments by a domestic institution could provide
added momentum for fiscal adjustment, in line with the approach followed for pension
reform. In addition, it could assist in making local authorities and the various watchdogs
internalize the overall consolidation requirement.
C. Structural Reforms
Reform Strategy and Impact
22.
Mindful of the need to preserve social cohesion, the authorities pointed to the
success of their gradual approach to structural reforms. They argued that without
building sufficient public awareness of the need and benefits of reform, reforms had often
faltered due to public hostility, expressed in strikes or electoral defeats of reform-minded
governments. In contrast, when reforms had been well prepared, through well-publicized
studies, debate within committees involving all stakeholders, and consensus-building,
resistance had been overcome (Box 3). The most striking success had been the 2003 pension
reform, while the recent health care reform had followed a similar mold. Consequently, the
authorities decided to adopt the same approach for labor market reform through the recently
established Advisory Council for Employment. To begin this process for product market
issues, they were emphasizing the need to focus on consumer welfare and had initiated
studies on the switching costs for consumers in utilities, financial services, and
telecommunications.

- 26 -

Box 3. France: Studies, Committees, and Consensus:
France’s Approach to Structural Reforms
Since the end of the 1990s, the French authorities have developed an approach to reform that
emphasizes consensus-reaching, based on technical studies and committees, before any
legislative action is taken. This method has been utilized in areas where strong public resistance had
previously prevented the authorities from changing the status quo, such as pensions (2003) and health
care (2004), and is ongoing in the area of labor policies.
Preliminary studies were conducted by academics, and committees were created at the
beginning of the reform process. Each time these committees bring together all involved actors––
members of parliament, social partners, experts, and representatives of the state. Following initial
diagnosis by established academics in their fields, these bodies are mandated to reach consensus on a
technical assessment of current situations and problems, and make recommendations for policy
reform.
Based on extensive consultation and cross-disciplinary expertise, these forums have proved
valuable in reaching consensus. They laid the foundations for the actual negotiations between social
partners and the government that took place later. Wide-spread dissemination of the academic reports
and the councils’ work has also been key in generating a somewhat less politicized debate and public
support for the reforms:
•

An initial report (Rapport Charpin, in 1999) followed by one from the Pension Advisory
Council, established in 2000, spelled out a detailed financial assessment of the public
pension funds that made the need for reform obvious to all its members. Based on these
works, consultations were held over 2002–03 and led to a major reform of the pension system
in August 2003.

•

The first report of the High Council for the Future of Health Care Insurance, created in 2003,
illustrated how unsustainable current health care spending had become. It served as
background analysis for the negotiations held in the first half of 2004, leading to the passage
of a comprehensive set of measures in August 2004.

•

Well-publicized studies commissioned by the government from Blanchard and Tirole in 2003
put forward new ideas to reshape the employment protection system. An Advisory Council
for Employment is scheduled to be set up in September 2005 to help reach consensus on
these or other reform proposals to improve the functioning of the labor market.

23.
The staff acknowledged that this consensus-building approach had delivered
results, while pointing to the benefits of a well-focused and coordinated package of
product and labor market reforms. Staff simulations with the Fund’s new Global
Economic Model (GEM) suggest that structural reform in France alone could raise French
GDP in the long run by more than 10 percentage points (Box 4). Simultaneous

- 27 -

Box 4. France: Macroeconomic Impact of Raising Product and
Labor Market Competition
Increasing competition in French product and labor markets has potentially very large macroeconomic payoffs. The Fund’s GEM was used to measure the impact of raising competition in
France to the average level in Denmark, Sweden, and the United Kingdom––the group of countries in
the EU with the most competitive markets (see Selected Issues Paper, “Estimating the
Macroeconomic Effects of Higher Competition in Product and Labor Markets” for details). In the
GEM, markups are summary measures of competition, reflecting the impact on wages and prices of
barriers to market entry, such as regulations, state involvement in markets, and legal protection of
incumbents. The experiment involved a reduction in French markups to the level of the abovementioned group of countries.
Stand-alone reforms in France across all
markets raise real GDP by more than
10 percent in the long run. The contribution of
higher competition in services is the largest
(5.8 percent), followed by labor markets
(3.7 percent) and goods markets (1.2 percent).
The differences across markets are mainly due to
the size of the decline in markups. As a result of
the EU’s internal market, the distance between
France and the group of best-performing
countries is smallest in goods markets. Where
progress in deregulation has been slower––
services and labor markets––markups in France
are much higher than in the comparator group.
Labor market reforms are effective in
creating jobs, even if implemented in
isolation. However, for the full benefits to
workers to accrue, it is better to combine them
with measures opening goods and services
markets to greater competition. Otherwise, lower
labor costs are not completely passed on to
consumer prices, and real wages remain
permanently below baseline (Figure 1).

Box 4. France: Macroeconomic Impact of Raising Product and
Labor Market Competition (Concluded)
Coordination of structural reforms within the
euro area has important advantages for France.
In the long run, real GDP in France increases by
an additional 3 percentage points, due to spillovers
from higher output in the other euro area member
states. In addition, French consumers profit from
lower import prices. In the short run, euro areawide inflationary pressures are significantly
reduced, which could allow monetary policy
accommodation by the ECB. Production capacities
increase with the entry of new firms and higher
labor supply; however, due to nominal and real
rigidities, demand is slow to adjust, resulting in a
negative output gap. If as a result prices decline,
monetary authorities would react to allow areawide interest rates to decline temporarily, which
brings forward investment and consumption
responses (Figure 2).

implementation of product market deregulation and labor market reforms has significant
benefits, particularly in terms of political economy. Product market reforms would allow
consumers to benefit from lower prices and higher purchasing power, thus easing the
transition cost of labor market reforms which would necessarily involve a period of wage
moderation as increased labor supply is put to work. Similarly, reform within the entire euro
area would allow larger cumulative effects due to spillovers, while coordination of its timing
could permit an easing of monetary policy which would virtually eliminate transition costs.
The authorities agreed with the thrust of this analysis, while noting that coordination might
be hard to achieve politically.
Labor Markets
24.
Despite improvements in labor market functioning during the 1990s, overall
utilization of labor potential remains among the lowest of OECD countries. Legal
employment protection is strong, the labor tax wedge is high, and wage flexibility is limited
for the low-paid (Figure 13). The staff noted that existing rigidities, while temporarily
shielding those with permanent jobs, reduce the capacity of the economy to adapt to changes
in technology and preferences. Consequently, structural unemployment is high, labor force
participation of the young is low, older workers exit early from the labor market, and annual

hours worked per worker are comparatively low. The staff observed that policies dealing
with these challenges had thus far focused on fiscally expensive active labor market
programs, leaving institutional obstacles to labor market flexibility untackled.
25.
Against this background, the authorities saw their new plan to promote job
creation as a breakthrough because it directly addressed some key labor market
rigidities (Box 5). The plan builds on existing reforms, such as the easing of the 35-hour
workweek restrictions, the social cohesion plan to bring long-term unemployed back to the
labor market, the promotion of personal services, and the adoption of an enabling framework
for life-long learning. The proposed new labor contract with a term of up to two years (CNE)
is an innovation as it has no firing restrictions and does not rely on budgetary support to
facilitate job creation. It had been focused on small enterprises because of their large number
and dynamism and their difficulties to benefit from measures facilitating the workweek
reduction. The authorities estimated that this initiative and its associated administrative and
fiscal simplifications could reduce the unemployment rate by 0.1 to 0.5 percentage point.
26.
There was agreement that additional, supporting reforms would be essential to
boost job creation meaningfully in the long term. The authorities did not dispute the
staff’s concern that the new labor contract might not have significant long-term effects, but
underscored that it should be seen as opening the door to more reforms. In essence, the CNE
increases the flexibility of fixed-term contracts without addressing the rigidities involved in
open-ended contracts. As shown theoretically and by experience elsewhere, such partial
reform may lead to more job turnover and less investment in human capital, ultimately
raising rather than lowering unemployment. As suggested in studies initiated by the
authorities (e.g., Kramarz-Cahuc), it would therefore be necessary to integrate all existing
labor contracts into a single one, with internalization of the social costs of layoffs and as little
legal uncertainty as possible.
27.
The staff welcomed the authorities’ determination to strengthen employment
services and job search incentives and called for a modification of the minimum wage
adjustment mechanism. The staff urged the adoption of complementary measures such as
the capping and phasing of unemployment benefits and the introduction of sanctions for
noncompliance with job search requirements, which were partially enacted shortly after the
mission. The staff further argued that future increases in the minimum wage should be
limited to changes in underlying consumer price inflation to increase the employability of
low-skilled workers and wage dispersion at the low end of the pay scale. The staff saw a need
for decreases in benefits in some cases to make the return to work pay and for the removal of
incentives inducing premature exit from the workforce. In this context, the staff welcomed
the intended elimination of the dismissal tax on older workers (contribution Delalande). The
authorities responded that the forthcoming renegotiation of the convention governing the
insurance system (UNEDIC) would provide an opportunity to consider the staff’s proposals,
but that it was primarily up to social partners to implement changes in this area.

- 31 -

Box 5. France: Are New Labor Market Initiatives a Breakthrough?1
1.
In mid-2005, the government adopted an emergency plan for employment (le plan d’urgence
pour l’emploi) and set the reduction of unemployment as the top economic policy priority. Specifically, the
plan includes: (i) introducing a new employment contract (CNE) for small enterprises with up to 20 employees,
with no hiring and firing restrictions during the first two years; (ii) simplifying administrative procedures and
extending certain tax exemptions to more enterprises by raising the eligibility threshold from 10
to 20 employees; (iii) providing an income tax credit to promote youth employment in specific sectors and more
support to facilitate job search; and (iv) fiscal incentives and administrative deregulation to improve
employment in the personal service sector.
2.
Past policy actions to tackle unemployment focused on active labor market programs, while
leaving labor market institutions largely unchanged. Remedial actions relied on employment subsidies,
earned income tax credits, and cuts in social security contributions—all at considerable cost to the budget.
Attempts were made to reduce unemployment also through work redistribution effort such as the reduction in
the work week. The results have been modest, as the French unemployment rate remains higher than the euro
area average.
3.
The new plan, while still relying partly on budget resources, takes an important step toward
reforming labor market institutions, but whether it will deliver the desired result is uncertain. While it
will facilitate hiring, the CNE represents only a partial reform of the employment protection legislation (EPL). It
introduces the needed flexibility for only up to two years and is limited to small enterprises. Academic studies
find this type of partial reform an ineffective way to reduce unemployment, with negative implications for
workers’ welfare and productivity, the main effect being a high turnover in fixed-duration workers with
insufficient investment in human capital, leading in turn to higher, not lower, unemployment.2 Experiences from
other countries, including Germany, Spain, and Sweden support this finding. For instance, after a partial reform
of employment protection legislation (EPL) in the late 1980s, the Spanish unemployment rate initially fell, but
began to rise rapidly in the early 1990s. Unemployment began to fall significantly only after the Spanish
government reformed the EPL for permanent contracts in the mid-1990s.
4.
The effectiveness of the new labor contract in promoting job creation and reducing the
unemployment rate will depend crucially on broadening its application and adopting supporting reforms.
Simulations of a search-matching model, with hiring and firing restrictions calibrated to the French labor
market, suggest that a reform, which effectively merges existing contracts into a single one by eliminating firing
restrictions and legal uncertainty (e.g., as in the proposal by Kramarz and Cahuc), would lower the structural
unemployment rate by 2 percentage points. This effect could be even larger (about 3 percentage points) when
firing costs are completely eliminated. The magnitude of these estimates should be interpreted with caution,
however, as high and binding minimum wages prevent the internalization of high hiring costs, while inefficient
employment services slow down the match of vacancies and unemployed workers. In this regard, further
reforms in these areas are needed to yield results of this magnitude.

France,” NBER Working Paper No. 8219, 2001.

Product Markets
28.
Privatization is being accelerated, while other important product market
reforms are set to continue. The authorities observed that the gas utility shares had been

- 32 -

successfully floated on the stock market, soon to be followed by the electricity utility and
further divestiture of highways. Legislation restricting large retailers’ ability to lower
distribution margins imposed by suppliers (loi Galland) is set to be modified, which is
expected to lead to a significant reduction in consumer prices. The authorities agreed that
while good progress had been made in reducing administrative regulation, more deregulation
was needed, particularly in the service sector (Figure 14). In this context, they favored
services sector liberalization in the EU, though they saw difficulties in accepting the “origin”
principle of the Bolkenstein directive as it would erode France’s social model.
D. Financial Sector
29.
Following up on last year’s FSAP, the authorities noted that they were raising
the efficiency of the financial sector but were not prepared to swiftly phase out
remaining administrative interventions. A bankruptcy law has been enacted, which
enables Chapter 11 type procedures and improves creditors rights; the prohibition to
remunerate sight deposits has been lifted, which prompted one bank to introduce such
remuneration; and administered interest rates are operated mostly by automatic formulas. The
planned creation of the postal bank—by separating mail activities—is expected to establish a
level-playing field with private institutions. It would increase competition, in particular for
mortgage loans, though since this is not a profitable business for banks (¶31), it is unlikely to
affect other banks’ profitability. In addition, mortgage markets are set to be reformed with
the introduction of home equity loans and the reduction of legal and regulatory transaction
costs. The latter will increase mortgage market activity, though only progressively, as
changes will became effective only in the course of 2006, and households remain reluctant to
engage in mortgages. While agreeing with last year’s FSAP’s observation that publiclyadministered savings schemes had lost their relevance and hampered monetary transmission
somewhat, the authorities felt that they could not easily unwind them because they enjoyed
continued public support.
30.
The financial sector performed well over the past year, though part of the
increase in profitability stemmed from a transitory reduction in provisioning as risk
declined (Figure 15 and Tables 5–7). Underpinning these good results, the authorities listed
excellent performances in retail banking, a drop in nonperforming loans, which allowed
lower provisioning, and successful diversification. They noted that owing to good
preparation, financial institutions and markets had adapted well to new accounting standards,
though they and sector representatives underscored that the full extent of the changes would
only be visible in a couple of years. While the supervisory body considered that recent losses
in derivatives incurred by some institutions did not raise systemic concerns, it urged all
banks, including mutual groups, to continue to upgrade their internal control system. With
respect to financial markets, the authorities were vigilant about hedge funds operating from
less regulated jurisdictions because of their attendant lack of transparency, and about the
difficulty of monitoring of risk, which has moved out of the financial sector but may retain
significant macroeconomic consequences through their impact on household savings and
wealth.

31.
In the context of a buoyant housing market, banks’ exposure to mortgage risk
would need to be closely watched. The authorities did not see evidence of a real estate
bubble as prices were still not at their previous peak in real terms, and household
affordability ratios remained reasonable. If very recent decelerating trends were to persist,
they thought that price increases might settle down to a moderate pace. In addition, mortgage
loans had so far been banks’ least risky activity. However, with the very rapid pace of
mortgage loans over the last few years, the authorities’ focus was on financial institutions’
balance sheets, which now included a large amount of new long-term assets with low
profitability. Indeed, mortgage interest rates are very low, as mortgages are used as loss
leaders to attract customers. A sharp increase in such rates would reduce financial sector
activity, but more importantly, would negatively impact households as a larger proportion of
mortgages is now at variable rates. However, the impact would be limited as the bulk of
mortgages is at fixed rates or subject to interest rate caps, and supervisory authorities
considered that banks still had sufficient buffers against this risk.
E. Other Issues
32.
The authorities expressed their commitment to securing a successful completion of
the Doha round of multilateral trade talks, though they noted that progress had been slow.
They supported EU initiatives with respect to textile imports from China, as they were in
line with quota agreements previously made. The adjustment of the French economy to the
removal of textile quotas was on track, with employment in the sector having declined by
more than half over the past 10–15 years. The authorities observed that the CAP reforms
agreed in 2003 as part of the mid-term review would be implemented in 2007 as envisaged.
Acceleration of its implementation, as recommended by the staff, would be tantamount to
reneging on agreements made with farmers. The authorities were determined to further
increase ODA from 0.41 percent of GNI in 2003, the highest among G-7 countries, to the
U.N. target of 0.7 percent of GNI in 2012. They expressed concern about the lack of funding
for developing aid, which was hampering progress toward achieving the millennium goals.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
While reforms and new labor market initiatives are fostering job creation, faster
and broader structural reform and fiscal adjustment are needed to overcome the
headwinds facing the recovery and deal with the consequences of aging. Though pension
and health care reforms of the past two years have substantially improved the prospects for
fiscal sustainability, the structural deficit remains high, and public debt has reached historic
peaks. Recent policy initiatives have added a new direction to labor market reforms, much
needed to reduce high unemployment, and ongoing product, services, and financial market
deregulation should foster support for reform. Nonetheless, it will be essential to build
further reform momentum, above all in the labor market. Otherwise, benefits in terms of
growth and job creation are likely to remain too limited to help achieve fiscal sustainability.
34.
Economic growth is expected to pick up, though at a below-potential pace and
subject to important risks. Growth is projected to edge up from 1.5 percent in 2005 to

- 36 -

about 1.8 percent in 2006. With the clarification of the direction of economic policies,
domestic demand should recover after a poor second quarter of 2005. However,
compounding downside risk from oil prices and trade partner weakness, export growth is
likely to remain sluggish, underscoring the importance of further structural reforms to
preserve competitiveness. With growth of output and domestic demand still ahead of the rest
of the euro area, monetary conditions are likely to remain quite accommodative. In these
circumstances, the necessary structural fiscal adjustment in 2006 would only slightly detract
from growth.
35.
Fiscal consolidation needs to resume in 2006 and should be sustained at a steady
pace. Growth-enhancing reforms should play a key role in this respect, but further fiscal
adjustment is equally necessary and should aim to achieve structural balance by 2010, before
rising costs of aging set in. Execution of the 2004 budget was exemplary. Sizable planned
consolidation was achieved by allocating all higher-than-expected revenues to deficit
reduction in 2004 and keeping central government spending constant in real terms. However,
consolidation stalled in 2005 primarily because initial plans lacked ambition. For 2006, key
elements are in place to secure some adjustment, but further measures are required to ensure
that the structural deficit falls by ½ of one percentage point of GDP. On the staff’s current
growth projections, bringing the deficit to less than 3 percent of GDP in 2006, as the
authorities seek, will require more adjustment.
36.
Fiscal consolidation should be underpinned by durable expenditure restraint.
Use of budgetary resources to help solve structural problems should be terminated, as it
prevents the budget from reaping the benefits of reforms. Instead, synergies between
structural reform and fiscal adjustment should be fully exploited. The forthcoming
renegotiation of the unemployment convention should be used as an opportunity to eliminate
the deficit of the unemployment insurance system. While short-term benefits of civil service
reform are limited, more efforts should be made to utilize the ongoing sizable wave of
retirements to help with medium-term consolidation.
37.
An overhaul of the tax system could significantly improve economic efficiency
but should be revenue-neutral unless accompanied by additional spending restraint. At
present, there is no further budgetary room for targeted reductions in social security
contributions. The taxe professionnelle should ideally be eliminated in the context of a
broader reform together with the establishment of alternative sources of revenue for local
authorities. Marginal tax rates should be reduced, by making use of the available room from
base-broadening.
38.
The framework for fiscal governance should be further strengthened. While
institutional changes for the central government and social security, in particular health care,
should keep spending on track, there is merit in mandating a domestic institution with
independent forward-looking budget assessments. This would provide momentum for fiscal
adjustment and increase buy-in from all sectors of the general government, including local
authorities.

39.
The authorities’ gradual consensus-building approach to reform has proven
successful, but the benefits of a coordinated package of labor and product market
reforms should be taken advantage of. When reforms had been well prepared, such as in
the case of pensions and health care, they had been well accepted by the public. As current
labor market reforms are likely to involve transition costs, it will be helpful to enact
accompanying product market reforms to boost consumer welfare. In addition, in the context
of monetary union, coordination of the timing of reform within the euro area could allow
monetary policy easing to mitigate these transition costs.
40.
To lower unemployment permanently, the recent innovative labor market
initiative needs to be accompanied by supporting reforms. The new labor contract for
small enterprises will facilitate job creation. Reducing unemployment in the long run will,
however, require the integration of all labor contracts into a single one and the elimination of
legal uncertainty. The ongoing strengthening of employment services will need to be
effective and complemented by capping and phasing of unemployment benefits and strict
enforcement of benefit duration limits and sanctions for noncompliance with job search
requirements. Future minimum wage increases should be restricted to underlying consumer
price inflation to price low-skilled workers back into the labor market.
41.
Ongoing and planned reforms in product markets should be accelerated. The
impending deregulation of retail distribution margins and the public flotation of the gas and
electricity utilities are helpful. Important strides are being made in reducing the
administrative burden on businesses, and similar determined efforts in economic deregulation
would be welcome. Opening up the services markets to orderly competition, both
domestically and within the EU context, is likely to generate appreciable efficiency gains.
42.
The financial system has been performing well, while reforms to improve its
efficiency should be complemented by the phasing out of remaining administered
savings and loan schemes. The supervisory authorities are appropriately focused on the
financial sector’s provisioning behavior, the adoption of new accounting standards, and the
rising exposure to residential real estate. The end to the prohibition to remunerate sight
deposits and the planned creation of the postal bank will promote competition. Long-standing
administered savings schemes should be eliminated, given that their objectives are no longer
relevant. As planned, mortgage markets should be further developed by reducing transaction
costs and facilitating home equity withdrawal.
43.
In the trade area, France should promote a successful completion of the Doha round
and support comprehensive liberalization of agricultural markets, in particular of market
access. In this context, rapid progress with the implementation of the CAP reform would be
helpful. It should avoid recourse to protectionist measures. France’s contribution to
development through its relatively high and steadily increasing level of ODA is
commendable, as is its intention to reach the UN target by 2012.
44.
It is proposed that the next Article IV Consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

1/ Indicates coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
5/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium- and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
7/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
8/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Real GDP growth (in percent)
Average nominal interest rate on public debt (in percent) 7/
Average real interest rate (nominal rate minus change in GDP deflator, in percent)

APPENDIX II

FRANCE: STATISTICAL ISSUES
France’s economic database is comprehensive and of high quality. The authorities regularly
publish a full range of economic and financial data, and calendar dates of main statistical
releases are also provided. The transmission of data in electronic form from INSEE (Institut
national de la statistique et des études économiques) and the profusion of data from various
institutions (Banque de France, INSEE, ministry of finance, ministry of labor and solidarity)
have helped to build an infrastructure, in which all data can be easily accessed through the
Economic Data Sharing System. As a subscriber to the Special Data Dissemination Standard
(SDDS), France posts its metadata on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(DSBB) on the Internet. A data ROSC mission conducted an assessment of the statistical
system in March 2003, and the report was published in October 2003. A factual update to the
main report was published in November 2004.
Since the beginning of 1999, France’s monetary and banking statistics methodology has
changed to reflect the standards of the European Economic and Monetary Union. Statistics
for International Financial Statistics on banking institutions and monetary aggregates are
prepared on a monthly basis and are timely.
France adopted the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts 1995 (ESA95)
in 1999. Data for GDP and its expenditure components are available from 1978 onwards.
Both annual and quarterly accounts provide reliable information, although estimates from the
two accounts differ slightly before the quarterly accounts are revised to be aligned to the
annual ones. In 2005, national accounts data were rebased to 2000 prices. While current and
constant 2000 prices are available, institutional sector data are only available from 1993
onwards and employment data from 1990 onwards. INSEE will publish in the near future the
complete set of national accounts with base 2000, and starting in 1978.
Data issues include the need to provide monthly or quarterly developments not only for the
finances of the central government, but also for social security and local governments. These
data should be presented in a comprehensive fashion and on a national accounts basis to
facilitate monitoring of public finances. The national accounts website has recently been
enhanced: it includes expenditure tables and government revenues by subsector (central
government, miscellaneous central government agencies, local governments, and social
security administration).
With regard to balance-of-payments statistics, the data ROSC mission recommended
initiating efforts to achieve greater coherence between the external current account and the
rest of the world account in national accounts. Work with promising early results has been
undertaken on the transportation account.

FRANCE: TABLE OF COMMON INDICATORS REQUIRED FOR SURVEILLANCE

- 48 APPENDIX II

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
FRANCE
Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European Department
(In consultation with the Policy Development and Review Department)
Approved by Michael Deppler and Matthew Fisher
October 27, 2005
This supplement to the staff report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation with France provides
an update on recent developments, in particular the authorities’ 2006 budget proposal and
their medium-term fiscal plans presented with the budget. The new information does not alter
the thrust of the staff appraisal except for the staff’s assessment of the structural fiscal
adjustment in 2005. Instead of noting an unchanged underlying position as in the staff report,
the staff now welcomes the fact that fiscal consolidation continued in 2005 (¶2).
Summary
Recent short-term economic indicators are consistent with the mild recovery projected by the
staff for the second half of 2005, but oil prices remain a risk and have pushed up headline
inflation. Additional measures have brought the 2005 deficit target of 3 percent of GDP
within reach. As a result, instead of an unchanged structural deficit expected on the basis of
information available for the staff report, underlying adjustment this year is now estimated to
be 0.4 percentage point of GDP. For 2006, the authorities count on growth of 2¼ percent
together with constant spending at the central government level and higher social security
contribution to reduce the deficit to 2.9 percent of GDP. Mainly owing to lower growth, the
staff projects the deficit to increase to 3.3 percent of GDP. While this estimate of the deficit is
much less than anticipated in the staff report, the corresponding structural adjustment is
similar (0.3 versus 0.2 percentage point of GDP, respectively) and continues to fall short of
staff recommendations.
Enterprises have begun to hire under the new labor contract (Contrat Nouvelles Embauches,
CNE), but it is too early to assess its impact on employment. To help raise the employment
rate of older workers, social partner representatives have agreed on a new fixed-duration
contract for such workers, subject to labor union and parliamentary approval. With respect
to international trade, the authorities are seeking to limit concessions proposed by the EU on
agricultural tariffs and subsidies.

-2-

Output and inflation
1.
The authorities project growth to rise from 1½–2 percent in 2005 to
2-2½ percent in 2006, largely due to increasing exports. The staff has maintained its
projections of the staff report at 1.5 percent and 1.8 percent for 2005 and 2006, respectively.
These projections are the same as the October Consensus forecast and, for 2005, of France’s
national statistics institute (INSEE) (Table 1).1 Recent data releases are consistent with a
modest recovery. Consumers have become slightly more confident, increasing spending on
manufactured goods, but stocks remain high. Industrial production appears to be recovering,
while services to enterprises show continued growth. Employment has been edging up, which
together with stricter enforcement of job search requirements allowed the unemployment rate
to fall to just below 10 percent of the labor force. Oil prices boosted headline inflation to
2.4 percent in September. As a result, the staff has increased its projection of average
consumer price inflation somewhat in both 2005 and 2006, while lowering the GDP deflator
in 2006 in line with the authorities’ projection—reflecting a squeeze on profit margins.
2005 Budget
2.
The 2005 budget deficit target of 3 percent of GDP is within reach and achieving
it would represent structural adjustment of 0.4 percentage point of GDP. The latter is
more than was expected in the staff report as revenues have been stronger in relation to
income, and credits equivalent to ¼ of one percentage point of GDP have been cancelled. In
addition, health care spending growth is being sharply reduced compared to 2004. Income
support to mitigate the impact of high oil prices appears well targeted to alleviate social
hardship and will have only limited consequences on the 2005 budget and marginal
implications for economic efficiency. Fiscal incentives favoring energy conservation and
investment in refining have been strengthened.
2006 Budget
3.
The draft 2006 budget aims to reduce the deficit marginally to 2.9 percent
of GDP, which requires underlying adjustment of 0.5 percentage point of GDP to
compensate for the decline in one-off revenues. In addition to relying on growth of
2¼ percent, this is to be accomplished as follows (Text Table 1):

INSEE projects only two quarters ahead and thus has no forecast for 2006.

1/ This includes exemption of taxe professionnelle for new investments, a decrease in the
corporate income tax rate, housing subsidies, and deductions on the inheritance tax.
2/ This is due to the wage bill––the tax base for social security contributions––increasing
at a more dynamic rate than nominal GDP, and some other dynamic tax bases.
3/ This assumes spending at various levels of government continues to increase at the same
rate as in 2005.
4/ Essentially exceptional dividends from state-owned enterprises.
5/ New measures on medicines and medical visits are expected to bring health care
spending growth from 3¾ percent in 2005 to 2½ percent in 2006.

•

On the expenditure side, general government spending is set to grow by not more
than 1.6 percent in real terms. Central government spending will remain constant in
volume for the fourth year in a row, though this is facilitated by moving some
spending to the revenue side as negative items. The number of civil servants will
decline by 9,700 (5,300 in terms of full-time equivalents).2 With additional reform
measures agreed in 2004 that have yet to come into effect, nominal health care
spending growth is targeted to decline from 3¾ percent in 2005 to 2½ percent
in 2006.3

Revenues from taxes and social security contributions will remain stable at about
44 percent of GDP. To promote employment, the earned income tax credit (prime

pour l’emploi) is being raised, and temporary incentives for job-taking by welfare
recipients and long-term unemployed are being introduced. The exemption of new
investment from the taxe professionnelle has been made permanent for the first two
years and the amount of the tax capped at 3.5 percent of value added. On the other
hand, contributions are being raised to reduce the deficit of the social security system.
All revenue windfalls, except those related to higher oil prices, are intended to go to
deficit reduction. A national committee has been set up to assess and propose an
allocation for any revenue windfalls due to higher oil prices.
•

A tax reform is being implemented, which will have no effect on the 2006 cash
budget but will lower revenues in 2007 by about 0.3 percentage point of GDP. It
improves efficiency and transparency by reducing the number of income brackets and
simplifying the tax rate structure. Statutory marginal tax rates are being lowered, but
marginal effective tax rates change little, as rate reductions are largely being paid for
by eliminating a 20 percent across-the-board tax exemption.

•

Nontax revenues are maintained at above trend levels in 2006 through dividend
payments by state-owned energy utilities, Banque de France, and a savings bank
(Caisse des dépôts), and a transfer of pension fund assets of the post office against
equivalent future liabilities.

Medium-term fiscal outlook
4.
Over the medium term (2007–09), the authorities intend to pursue expenditure
restraint to achieve underlying adjustment, while reducing the tax burden slightly. In
the authorities’ low-case medium-term scenario, growth is set to continue at 2¼ percent per
year, while real general government spending growth would fall from 1.2 percent in 2007 to
0.6 percent by 2009 (Text Table 2). This will require a decline in real central government
spending by 1 percentage point per year during 2007–09 and a durable reduction in nominal
health care spending growth to 2.4 percent per year. This scenario would result in a structural
adjustment of 1.1 percentage points of GDP over three years. In the staff’s view, taking only
explicit measures into account, real general government spending would continue to increase
at about 1.4 percent per year. Consequently, the staff projects only a marginal improvement
in the structural balance by 2009. The authorities also present a high-case medium-term
scenario with higher annual economic growth of 3 percent due to structural reforms and
additional spending restraint, mainly at the local level, yielding a further decline in real
general government expenditure growth to 0.3 percent. As a result, structural adjustment
would reach 2.1 percentage points of GDP over three years.

Conclusion
5.
The execution of the 2005 budget is likely to deliver more fiscal adjustment than
anticipated, and fiscal discipline is set to continue, but the 2006 draft budget falls short
of staff recommendations. Better revenue performance and additional fiscal measures have
brought the 2005 budget deficit target of 3 percent of GDP within reach. For 2006,
maintaining central government expenditure constant in volume terms is welcome while
ongoing health care reforms will also contribute to spending control. Nonetheless, achieving
the modest reduction in the deficit in 2006 relies on higher-than-consensus growth
projections, increases in social security contributions, and further nontax revenue measures.
Underlying fiscal adjustment, in particular excluding one-offs, is well below ½ of
one percentage point of GDP and less than in 2005. The proposed tax reform increases
efficiency, though its attendant revenue loss, which will affect the 2007 budget, runs ahead of
the identification of specific expenditure cuts. The policy response to high oil prices is

-6-

welcome, but most of the income support measures will need to be subject to a sunset clause
to prevent permanent price distortions.
6.
For the medium term, additional structural reforms and a considerable
reduction in spending as a share of GDP in line with the authorities’ high-case scenario
are needed to deal with the consequences of aging. On current policies, the staff projects
the structural balance to remain in a deficit of about 2 percent of GDP over the medium term.
Implementation of the authorities’ low-case scenario would still leave the budget in a
structural deficit, providing insufficient consolidation to address the costs of aging. Reducing
real central government spending and sharply curbing local spending growth as in the
authorities’ high-case scenario would eliminate the structural deficit over the medium term,
an appropriate response to the challenge of aging. Given the magnitude of the required
adjustment, it will be important to identify early on durable expenditure measures to underpin
the credibility of this scenario. Among these, greater advantage will need to be taken of the
wave of civil servant retirements to realize the desired efficiency gains.4

4

Current plans foresee a reduction in the number of civil servants equivalent to 15 percent of retirements.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with France
On November 2, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV Consultation with France.1
Background
The cyclical recovery of the French economy was interrupted in the first half of 2005 as previously
strong domestic demand faltered and the external sector continued to exert a drag on growth.
In 2004, growth was faster and more consumption-driven than in other large euro area countries.
Employment growth in hours, increases in minimum wages, and some fiscal measures supported
private household incomes. Consumers also dipped into savings, reflecting relatively favorable
demographics, rising financial wealth, and a confidence-preserving execution of pension and
health reforms.
Against this background, the fall in private consumption in the second quarter of 2005 was
unexpected, possibly related to stagnating unemployment, rising oil prices, and political turmoil
surrounding the rejection of the EU constitution. Fixed investment and residential construction
continued to expand. Net exports have been reducing annual growth by about 1 percentage
point. Several factors play a role: the recent appreciation of the real exchange rate dampened
exports, and partner demand has been cyclically weak. Conversely, domestic demand has been
strong, boosting imports. However, as indicated by the staff’s econometric work, these factors
cannot fully explain the weak external performance.
While short-term indicators, e.g., consumer confidence, have improved somewhat, high oil prices
dampen the outlook, prompting the staff to forecast growth rising from 1.5 percent in 2005 to
1.8 percent in 2006 as domestic demand and exports recover. The authorities foresee higher

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the Executive
Board discussion based on the staff report.

-2growth in a range of 1.5 to 2 percent for 2005 followed by 2 to 2.5 percent in 2006. High oil prices
have pushed headline inflation above 2 percent, but underlying inflation has remained stable at a
lower level. The staff projects inflation to decline from an average of 2.1 percent in 2005 to
1.9 percent in 2006. Reflecting adverse demographics, potential output growth is projected to fall
to 1.9 percent from 2006 onward.
The 2006 draft budget targets a reduction in the general government deficit to 2.9 percent of GDP
from 3.0 percent of GDP in 2005 and 3.6 percent of GDP in 2004. Following a structural
improvement of about 0.4 percentage point of GDP in 2005, the staff estimates the structural
balance to improve by 0.3 percentage point of GDP in 2006. Structural adjustment is achieved
through expenditure restraint at the central government level and in health care. The net tax
burden remains roughly constant, because the increase in social security contributions, largely
related to the health care reform, is offset by tax relief favoring investment and a variety of smaller
tax cuts in other areas. For 2007–09, the authorities present a high- and a low-case scenario,
with cumulative structural fiscal adjustment over three years of 2.1 percent of GDP and
1.1 percent of GDP, respectively, achieved through different paces of reduction in real general
government spending growth. Taking into account known measures only, the staff sees no
improvement in the structural deficit over this period.
On structural issues, a new labor contract without firing restrictions has been introduced for small
firms, and social partners have agreed on a special fixed-term contract for workers aged 57 or
older with the aim of raising their employment rate. The earned income tax credit (PPE) is being
increased, relocation subsidies are being offered to those who accept work far from home, and
fiscal incentives have increased for the return of the long-term unemployed to the labor market,
and in support of employment in personal services. At the same time, public employment services
and job search obligations have been strengthened. In product markets, divestiture from
commercial activities has been accelerated. In the distribution sector, margin regulations have
been relaxed.
Regarding the financial sector, a new bankruptcy law has been enacted, improving creditor rights;
the prohibition to remunerate sight deposits has been lifted; a postal bank is being created by
separating mail activities; and transaction costs in mortgage markets are set to be reduced. Bank
profitability increased, and nonperforming loans declined. Supervisors urged banks to improve
their internal control systems and closely watch exposure to mortgage risk, especially in light of
possible increases in interest rates.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the authorities for their continued progress on fiscal consolidation and
pursuit of structural reform in an environment of weak economic growth and difficult political
circumstances. They welcomed the larger than expected fiscal adjustment in 2005 and the new
labor market initiatives, which they felt would foster job creation. Similarly, the ongoing product,
services, and financial market reforms would underpin support for labor market reforms. To raise
the growth potential further and achieve fiscal sustainability, Directors urged the authorities to
sustain the recent pace of fiscal consolidation in 2006 and beyond and to build further structural
reform momentum, especially by broadening recent labor market initiatives.
On the near-term economic outlook, Directors noted that growth is likely to pick up from its trough
earlier in 2005, driven by an improvement in the external environment and a return of domestic
demand to a normal pace following the clarification of the direction of economic policies in midyear. However, compounding downside risk from oil prices and trade partner weakness, export

-3growth could remain sluggish, underscoring the importance of structural reforms to contain labor
costs and preserve competitiveness. In this context, it will be important to avoid second-round
effects from high oil prices on wages. Directors saw the authorities’ fiscal response to high oil
prices as appropriately balancing the need to provide income support to selected groups with the
need to preserve budget discipline and avoid significant price distortions.
Directors welcomed the continuing fiscal consolidation in 2005, whereby the objective of reducing
the deficit to 3 percent of GDP was now within reach despite slow growth. For 2006, Directors
urged the authorities to step up the pace of underlying adjustment and avoid recourse to one-off
measures. They supported the intent to keep central government expenditure constant in real
terms and sustain the decline in health spending growth. Directors noted, however, that achieving
the targeted deficit of 2.9 percent of GDP in 2006 relied on an official growth projection on the
high end of the current range of forecasts, increases in social security contributions, and
nonrecurring nontax revenues. Consequently, Directors encouraged the authorities to consider
additional measures to ensure that the underlying deficit falls by ½ of one percentage point of
GDP in 2006.
To prepare decisively for the consequences of an aging population, Directors urged the
authorities to be ambitious in reducing the share of public spending in GDP and in implementing
growth-enhancing structural reforms. They urged the authorities to aim for structural budget
balance before rising costs of aging set in at the end of the decade. As illustrated in the
authorities’ high case scenario, which would deliver this objective, this would require a reduction
in central government spending in real terms and a sharp decline in local spending growth. Given
the magnitude of this challenge, Directors urged the authorities to begin to implement durable
expenditure measures early on.
Directors encouraged the authorities to focus fiscal consolidation squarely on expenditure
restraint. With the tax burden already high, renewed increases in social security contributions to
cover the deficits of the health care and unemployment systems would further discourage work
effort. Instead, Directors saw scope for exploiting synergies between structural reforms and fiscal
adjustment, especially in the area of labor market programs. Furthermore, while Directors
acknowledged that short-term benefits of civil service reform are limited, they underscored that
the ongoing wave of civil servant retirements provided an opportunity to reap efficiency gains that
should be fully explored.
Directors supported the planned tax reforms as they would raise economic efficiency. They
welcomed the permanent reform of the taxe professionnelle (a tax on enterprises), noting that in
the long run, this tax should ideally be eliminated in the context of a broader reform establishing
alternative revenue sources for local authorities. Directors supported the reduction in marginal
income tax rates and the simplification of the rate structure, although they pointed out that the
associated revenue loss should not derail the authorities’ fiscal consolidation plans. In this
context, Directors also underscored that use of budgetary resources to mitigate structural
problems should be restrained and they saw, at present, no room for further targeted reductions
in social security contributions to reduce labor costs.
To help achieve fiscal consolidation objectives, Directors saw merit in a further strengthening of
the framework for fiscal governance. In this context, they welcomed the new objective-oriented
budgeting framework for the central government, which came into effect with the 2006 budget,
and the outreach approach to controlling health care spending. To help build momentum for fiscal
adjustment and ensure buy-in from all levels of government, Directors welcomed the authorities’
efforts to closely involve local governments in fiscal consolidation plans. In this context, further

-4strengthening of domestic institutions to provide forward-looking budget assessments would be
helpful.
Directors congratulated the authorities on their successful consensus-building approach to
structural reform, encouraging them to take advantage of the benefits of a coordinated package
of labor and product market reforms. A few Directors cautioned that this approach should not be
allowed to lead to undue delays in implementing needed reforms. Directors observed that when
reforms had been well prepared they had been well accepted by the public. They felt that, as
current labor market reforms might involve some transitional costs and uncertainty, it would be
useful to enact accompanying product market reforms to boost consumer welfare. Also,
coordination of the timing of reforms within the euro area could allow monetary policy to respond,
thus mitigating transition costs.
Directors strongly supported the recent labor market initiatives. They considered that the new
labor contract for small enterprises would facilitate job creation and that the strengthening of
employment services, job search compliance, and the earned income tax credit would help lower
unemployment. They were also encouraged by social partners’ agreeing to adopt a contract to
promote employment of older workers. Directors urged the authorities to adopt more flexible labor
contracts throughout the entire labor market to secure a durable and significant reduction of
unemployment. In this context, Directors saw a need to restrict future minimum wage increases to
underlying consumer price inflation so as to bring low-skilled workers back into employment.
In product markets, Directors welcomed the steps toward divestiture of network industries, the
deregulation of retail margins, and the reduction in the administrative burden on enterprises,
which would all enhance the growth potential of the economy. They encouraged the authorities to
make similar determined efforts on economic deregulation and to open up further the services
markets to competition, both domestically and within the EU context.
Directors observed that the financial system had been performing well and that supervisors had
been appropriately focused on the sector’s provisioning behavior, the adoption of new accounting
standards, and the rising exposure to the residential housing market. Most Directors welcomed
the impending establishment of the postal bank and the end to the prohibition to remunerate sight
deposits, as it would promote competition. Most Directors encouraged the authorities to phase
out remaining administrative interventions in the financial system to improve overall efficiency.
Directors urged France to show the flexibility necessary to contribute to a successful conclusion
of the Doha round, which was at a critical stage. Particularly important will be achieving greater
liberalization of the agricultural sector, which would benefit consumers as well as the international
community.
Directors welcomed France’s commendable contribution to development assistance and its
intention to reach the U.N. target level.
