Consultation and team. The 2011 Article IV Consultation was held in Douala and Yaoundé
(March 16–31).The mission team met with Prime Minister Yang, State Minister at the Presidency
Esso, Finance Minister Menye, Economy Minister Motaze, BEAC National Director Mani, several
other cabinet and parliament members, senior officials, the business community, representatives of
labor unions and civil society organizations, and development partners. The team comprised
Messrs. Mecagni (head), Nsengiyumva, Garcia-Verdu, and Ms. Bova (all AFR), Mr. Sacasa
(MCM), Ms. Funke (FAD), and Mr. Kpodar (Resident Representative). Mr. Bah (OED) and staff
of the World Bank and the African Development Bank participated in several meetings.
Background and consultation focus. The economy is recovering from the impact of the global
crisis and inflation remains contained. However, problems in public financial management in 2009
recurred on a similar scale in 2010, and usable fiscal buffers have been eroded. The 2011 budget is
under pressure from previous years’ unsettled payment obligations and other arrears; increasing
subsidies to support the freeze in retail fuel prices; and uncertainty in mobilizing domestic
financing. Banking sector risks remain elevated because some local banks are financially weak.
Policy discussions focused on necessary measures to (i) mitigate the risks to the 2011 budget and
preserve fiscal sustainability; (ii) improve public financial management (PFM) practices;
(iii) safeguard the stability of the financial system; and (iv) address key constraints to growth.
Policy advice. Recommendations include: (i) minimize 2011 budget risks by implementing a strict
treasury plan that takes into account government payment obligations and by initiating the new
bond issuance as early as possible; (ii) strengthen public expenditure management, in particular, by
conducting a comprehensive audit of government arrears, improving the tracking of spending
flows, and enhancing execution capacity for public investment; (iii) closely monitor bank
vulnerabilities, in collaboration with the regional supervisor, and define a coordinated strategy to
resolve the situation of financially weak banks; and (iv) promote faster economic growth by
improving the business climate and tackling infrastructure bottlenecks, while safeguarding debt
sustainability with a prudent borrowing policy.
The authorities’ position. The authorities were receptive to the staff assessment of fiscal and
financial risks. They intend to implement a tight treasury management plan, accelerate the
implementation of planned PFM reforms, and closely monitor developments in the banking sector.
They were reluctant, however, to consider adjustment measures that could address the financing
gap ahead of the October 2011 presidential elections, which will be followed by parliamentary
elections in mid-2012.

I. BACKGROUND: WEAK GROWTH PERFORMANCE AND STAGNANT
POVERTY RATES
1.
In recent years, Cameroon’s growth performance has remained weak and the
economy vulnerable to exogenous shocks. Macroeconomic stability has been preserved,
and debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and Multilateral
Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) helped firm up debt sustainability. However, there was no
growth in per capita terms over the last five years, despite a relatively diversified productive
base (Text Table 1 and Figure 1).1 Poverty rates stagnated at close to 40 percent, with strong
regional disparities and 87 percent of the poor living in rural areas (Figure 2). Growth has
been constrained by underinvestment in critical infrastructure, an unfavorable business
climate, poor public financial management, a shallow financial sector, and weak regional
trade integration. The country has remained dependent on commodities for export earnings
and fiscal revenues, and is thus vulnerable to external shocks, as shown during the recent
global financial crisis.2 Its nonoil government revenue, as a ratio to nonoil GDP, has
remained lower than the average of other sub-Saharan African oil exporters (Figure 3).

All figures are at the end of the text.

The impact of the crisis was mitigated by (i) measures taken in 2009 to protect distressed sectors (forestry and
cotton); (ii) the recovery of world commodity prices as of mid-2009; and (iii) financial support from the IMF
under the Rapid-Access Component of the Exogenous Shocks Facility (RAC-ESF).

2.
The political situation is currently stable. However, social unrest (as seen in
2008) could re-emerge ahead of presidential (October 2011) and legislative (mid-2012)
elections, given widespread poverty, youth unemployment, and increasing income and
wealth inequalities.
Box 1. Cameroon: Response to Recent Fund Advice
Policy Area

Fund Advice

Fiscal policy
and public
financial
management

(i) Protect priority capital spending;
make efforts to mobilize revenues;
gradually phase out fuel subsidies;
and avoid depleting the fiscal
buffer of usable government
deposits.

(i) In 2010, the execution rate on capital
expenditure remained low (75 percent);
nonoil revenues were lower than
programmed; fuel subsidies were not
phased out; and usable deposits were
almost depleted.

(ii) Strengthen expenditure and
cash management.

(ii) A Treasury Management Committee
became operational, but domestic arrears
problems continued.

(iii) Establish an effective
mechanism to track expenditure
flows through the budget execution
process.

Outcomes

(iii) An effective mechanism to track
expenditure flows is not yet in place.

(iv) Recognize the constraint
imposed by accumulated unsettled
payment obligations (UPOs) on
resources for the following year
budget, and adopt a budgetary
treatment for committed spending
for which no payment order has
been issued (DENOs).

(iv) The 2011 budget program includes
an allocation for the clearance of UPOs
and foresees a mechanism to control
DENOs.

Financial sector
stability

In collaboration with the regional
bank supervisor, monitor closely
bank vulnerabilities and promote a
gradual adoption of best practices
to mitigate concentration risks.

Little progress has been made in dealing
with local banks in weak financial
condition.

Other structural
reforms

Make the business environment
more attractive; strengthen
governance; and accelerate regional
integration.

Efforts to improve the business climate
were pursued by intensifying the dialogue
with the private sector and implementing
an agreed action plan. No concrete
progress on regional integration.

7
3.
Data provision to the IMF is broadly adequate for surveillance, but important
gaps exist in fiscal, external, and financial sector information. Government financial
operations on a commitment basis (consistent with accounts on a cash basis) and financial
sector soundness indicators are not regularly available. The quality and timeliness of balance
of payments statistics need to be improved. Monetary data availability is subject to unusually
long delays. The authorities have adopted and started implementing, with donors’ technical
assistance, a strategy for improving national statistics.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS: GRADUAL RECOVERY AND
LOW INFLATION, BUT RECURRENT PFM PROBLEMS IN 2010
4.
The economy continues to recover from the global crisis, and inflation
remains contained. Real GDP growth in 2010 is estimated at 3.2 percent, up from 2 percent
in 2009, despite a sizeable drop in oil output. The recovery is driven by nonoil,
export-oriented sectors, reflecting external demand and tax incentives granted by the
authorities to boost production in agriculture and forestry. Average annual inflation was
contained at 1.3 percent, compared with 3 percent in 2009 (Figure 4). Food price inflation
was 2.3 percent, down from 5.9 percent a year before, with the recent sharp increase in
international commodity prices having so far a limited impact.3
5.
External accounts have benefited from the rebound in export demand. This
generated an increase in 2010 of 3.5 percent in nonoil export volume. In contrast, import
volume growth is estimated at 8.2 percent, in response to domestic demand. The external
current account deficit (including grants), at 2.8 percent of GDP, is estimated to have
declined by about one percentage point of GDP.
6.
Fiscal accounts on a cash basis show a limited overall budget deficit in 2010.
Domestic revenue was close to the supplementary budget target (16.8 percent of GDP),
because the oil revenue windfall generated by the recent oil-price surge compensated for a
shortfall in nonoil revenue (0.6 percent of GDP). In terms of composition of spending,
current expenditure was higher than budgeted (14.5 against 13.9 percent of GDP), while
capital expenditure suffered from delays in issuing government bonds and mobilizing
external financing, and from implementation capacity constraints. The deficit on a cash basis,
after accounting for the clearing of outstanding government obligations accumulated in
previous years, was relatively modest (2.3 percent of GDP) and below the 3.5 percent of
GDP targeted in the supplementary budget (Text Table 2 and Table 3).

3

This is due in particular to good harvests for certain crops, the freeze of retail fuel prices, and the impact of
price controls through understandings signed between the government and economic operators to keep a lid on
retail prices and prevent shortages of basic goods.

Some efforts were made to deal with the legacy of PFM problems incurred in
2009 and to rein in spending programs. Budget data were reconciled between departments
to assess the nature and level of unsettled payment orders (UPOs). Out of a total stock of
CFAF 260 billion (2.5 percent of GDP) of UPOs at end-2009, CFAF 240 billion were cleared
in 2010 through cash payment or accounts reconciliation. Most end-2009 arrears to the oil
refinery were settled, through borrowing from the BEAC against the proceeds from the
general SDR allocation.4 In addition, a supplementary budget taking into account likely
shortfalls in revenue and the need to reduce and reallocate expenditure was adopted by
presidential decree in September 2010.
8.
However, budget execution in 2010 was affected by the same problems and on
a similar scale (Text Table 3 and Figure 5):


4

Following the decision to keep retail oil prices stable despite the increase in world
prices for petroleum products, arrears to SONARA at end-2010 amounted to some

The Treasury made direct transfers to commercial banks in early July 2010, proportionate to each bank’s
exposure to the oil refinery. This removed a source of systemic risk for most commercial banks. The exposure
of these banks had reached 80 percent of their capital on average, and in one case was three times the level of
capital.

9
CFAF 136 billion (1.2 percent of GDP).5 SONARA in turn accumulated tax arrears
close to CFAF 45 billion to the government.


The flow of UPOs on 2010 operations reached CFAF 250.6 billion (2.3 percent of
GDP) by end-year, a level much higher than in 2009. The end-2010 stock stood at
CFAF 271 billion (2.4 percent of GDP).



Fiscal buffers were significantly eroded. The level of government usable deposits at
the BEAC declined to the equivalent of 0.2 months of public spending at end-2010,
from 1 month at end-2009. The near depletion of usable deposits reflected the lack of
budgetary allocations (in the 2010 budget) for the clearance of pre-existing UPOs and
the tight liquidity situation associated with delays in the first-time placement of
government bonds (Box 2).6

Box 2: Cameroon’s Experience with a First-Time Issuance of Government Bonds
The 2010 budget financing relied on the issuance of government bonds (CFAF 200 billion; about
1.8 percent of GDP) on the regional market. Because of delays in setting up the required
infrastructure at the BEAC for such a market, the authorities decided to issue the bonds on the
domestic market, through the Douala Stock Exchange. A syndicate of three local banks was
selected to promote the operation.
Preparations were slower than expected. The decree authorizing the Minister of Finance to
negotiate with the bank syndicate was signed in September, earmarking the proceeds to specific
infrastructure projects.
The issuance operation was launched on November 18, and subscriptions were to take place in
December. The terms of the issue were a maturity of five years, an interest rate of 5.6 percent,
and a one-year grace period for repayment. The subscription outcome was officially validated on
December 29 by the Financial Market Commission. Total subscriptions amounted to
CFAF 203.2 billion, of which only the

Conditions in the banking system are troubled, reflecting (i) the difficult
financial position of 3 out of the 12 commercial banks; (ii) excessive credit concentration and
insufficient loan provisioning; and (iii) the impact of government domestic arrears on bank
borrowers (Appendix II). Financial sector soundness indicators deteriorated in 2010, as
shown by the drop in the system-wide average capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (from
about 10 percent in 2009 to 7 percent in 2010), the increase in the ratio of nonperforming
loans (NPLs) to total loans (from about 13 percent to 15 percent) and the decline in the ratio
of provisions to NPLs (from 79 percent to 75 percent) (Table 6).

11
III. MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK: POSITIVE GROWTH PROSPECTS
WITH BALANCED RISKS
10.
Economic growth is expected to pick up gradually under current policies. Real
GDP growth in 2011 is projected at 3.8 percent and is expected to increase to 5 percent in
2014 (Text Table 4). The positive outlook is driven by the ongoing recovery of the global
economy, the execution of infrastructure programs, and current initiatives to improve the
business climate:7


Oil production is expected to contribute to real GDP growth in 2012–14, with
National Oil Company (SNH) projections pointing to a sizeable increase in
production (about 23 percent on average during that period), followed by a
resumption of the declining trend. The projected increase reflects the coming
on-stream of ongoing investments, after successful exploration efforts during the
last three years.



Nonoil growth is to be supported by ongoing major projects to boost agricultural
productivity and competitiveness, construction related to the public investment
program, and implementation of planned measures to improve the business
environment (Box 3).

11.
Inflation is expected to remain below the regional convergence criterion of
3 percent. Ongoing initiatives to boost agricultural production and subsidize imports of food
are likely to moderate the impact of world food prices. Inflation could, however, temporarily
overstep the convergence target if the current policy of freezing retail fuel prices were to be
revisited.
12.
The external current account deficit is projected to remain manageable,
within the range of 3 to 4 percent. The combination of gradual improvement in nonoil
exports; a jump in oil production starting in 2012; and persistent high oil prices would tend to
offset the expected increase in import volumes. A broadly stable current account deficit is
expected to be financed mainly by private flows and new public foreign borrowing.
13.
Medium-term fiscal projections are predicated on continued efforts on the
part of the authorities to strengthen revenue mobilization, contain nonpriority
spending, and address infrastructure gaps. A gradual strengthening in revenue
mobilization is expected to improve the ratio of nonoil revenue to nonoil GDP by about
1 percentage point from 2011 to 2016. Efforts to tackle infrastructure bottlenecks should
result in a sustained increase in capital spending, while maintaining the nonoil primary deficit
7

The baseline scenario assumes a gradual moderate increase in private investment from 12.6 percent of GDP in
2010 to 13.8 percent in 2016.

12
within the range of 5 percent to 6 percent of nonoil GDP to anchor the fiscal stance. A steady
flow of oil revenue, resulting from the projected increase in oil production and high
international oil prices, would gradually lower the overall budget deficit, turning it into a
surplus after 2013. Projected new borrowing would increase total public debt from about
12 percent of GDP in 2010 to 15.5 percent in 2016 without jeopardizing debt sustainability.
14.
Risks to the medium-term outlook are broadly balanced. These include (i) the
uncertain pace and strength of the global recovery; (ii) a vulnerable banking sector that may
generate fiscal liabilities and affect the real sector; and (iii) potential delays in the
implementation of reforms in a protracted election environment. On the upside, a faster and
more effective implementation of the new large public infrastructure projects would generate
nonoil sector growth higher than projected under the baseline.

IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS: MAINTAINING MACROECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL
STABILITY AND FOSTERING GROWTH
15.
The authorities recognize that pressures on the budget, the erosion of fiscal
buffers, continued weaknesses in PFM and the financial sector have increased risks to
macroeconomic stability. Policy discussions therefore centered on (i) containing risks to the
2011 budget; (ii) improving PFM conditions; (iii) ensuring stability in the financial system;
(iv) addressing infrastructure gaps while preserving debt sustainability; and (v) boosting
competitiveness and economic growth.
A. Controlling Risks for the 2011 Budget
16.
The 2011 budget adopted in November 2010 was broadly as discussed with
staff in September 2010 (Tables 2 and 3). The budget projects nonoil revenue to reach
14.1 percent of nonoil GDP (up from 13.3 percent in 2010), supported by new administrative
and tax policy measures.8 Expenditure will remain at 2010 levels (18.7 percent of GDP) with
a constant level of overall subsidies (3.1 percent of GDP). A large increase in capital
spending is compensated by declining current spending, mainly in goods and services. The
overall budget deficit (2.6 percent of GDP), together with amortization of external and
domestic debt (0.8 percent of GDP), is expected to be financed by (i) external project
financing (1.3 percent); (ii) drawings from government deposits (0.4 percent);9 and
(iii) issuance of government bonds (1.3 percent) and treasury bills (0.4 percent).
17.
While the 2011 budget is benefiting from the oil price revenue windfall, it is
coming under pressure from multiple factors, including:10


Arrears to the domestic oil refinery and increasing fuel subsidies. The 2011 budget
did not incorporate an allocation to clear the stock of past obligations to the oil
refinery (CFAF 136 billion at end-2010). Also, at current world market prices,
maintaining the present retail fuel price policy will require a subsidy of about

8

The key measures foreseen in the 2011 budget and currently being implemented include (i) reversing
temporary rate reductions granted to sectors hit by the global crisis in 2008–09; (ii) enforcing the special tax on
tobacco and alcohol products; and (iii) reinstating VAT withholding at source procedures.

9

At the time of the preparation of the 2011 budget, drawings from government deposits were projected on the
basis of end-August 2010 stock, which was close to 1 percent of GDP.

10

The authorities’ decision in February 2011 to launch a special civil service recruitment of 25,000 new
graduates is not among these factors. Staff concurred with the authorities that there is enough space in the
budgeted wage bill for 2011 to absorb the cost of the new recruitment (estimated at about CFAF 15 billion).

14
CFAF 240 billion in 2011, CFAF 108 billion more than foreseen in the budget
(Appendix I).


Resources needed to clear remaining UPOs accumulated in previous years. The
clearing of UPOs could require resources as high as CFAF 225 billion (out of a stock
of about CFAF 271 billion at end-2010), taking into account the ongoing verification
process. The budget provision is less than half of this amount.



Costs linked to the “Mission for the Regulation of the Supply of Staple Goods”
(MIRAP) and not incorporated into the budget. The institutional framework for this
initiative is yet to become operational. According to its instituting decree, MIRAP has
several mandates, including providing information on food market conditions,
building and maintaining stocks, and supplying markets with staple goods at a ‘fair’
price level.11



Potential expenditure overruns on goods and services spending to cover costs of the
election process and other upcoming national events, in light of the 2010 experience
(overruns reached 1.2 percent of GDP).



Contingent claims from the restructuring of distressed banks. At present, these
contingent claims are difficult to quantify and dependent on the authorities’ ongoing
asset recovery efforts.12 The 2011 budget does not provide resources to cover this
kind of expenditure.



Uncertainty regarding the capacity of the regional market to absorb the second bond
issuance.13 The absorption capacity of the regional securities market is weakened by
uncertainty surrounding the enforcement of the prudential standard for risk
concentration.14

11

The fiscal cost of actions under the MIRAP initiative is uncertain at this moment.

12

Recapitalization needs have been estimated at CFAF 60 billion (0.5 percent of GDP) for one distressed bank
and are still uncertain in the case of two smaller banks also in weak financial conditions. Government
contribution to the banks’ recapitalization has been estimated tentatively at 0.2 percent of GDP in the staff fiscal
projections for 2011.
13

In light of this uncertainty, staff projections assume that one third (CFAF 50 billion) of the budgeted bond
issuance could be placed on the regional market and subscribed by banks that did not take part in the first
issuance.
14

Regional regulations would require banks that took part in the first issuance for their own account to be
barred from underwriting a second issue without first increasing their capital. Information on the potential
impact is not yet available, but banks that have recorded the securities they hold as “transaction securities” have
only six months before enforcement of the risk concentration ratios begins. The liquidity of government bonds

(continued…)

15
18.
Incorporating these risks in fiscal projections implies that there could be a
residual financing gap of up to 2.7 percent of GDP. To reduce the financing needs, staff
advised the authorities to (i) clarify with the regional bank supervisor the ambiguous
regulatory treatment of sovereign bonds in bank portfolios that could adversely affect
demand for the new bonds and start preparing the 2011 issuance as soon as possible;
(ii) implement a strict treasury plan and identify nonpriority spending that could be
contained; (iii) step up administrative efforts to improve nonoil revenue collection; (iv) in
case it becomes evident that the bond issuance is unlikely to be completed this year, start
preparing a contingency plan involving postponement of new public projects and addressing
the risk of accumulating new arrears, which could undermine future bond issuances; and
(v) pursue a reassessment of the fuel price formula and, as soon as political conditions allow,
gradually restore the automatic adjustment of retail fuel prices to international prices to
reduce subsidies, redeploy the associated resources to achieve higher benefits for the poor
through targeted social protection mechanisms, and avoid new arrears to the refinery
(Appendix I).
19.
The authorities indicated their determination to implement a tight treasury
management plan, but were reluctant to consider the adoption of further corrective
measures ahead of the coming elections. With a tight treasury situation, there is a
significant risk of large domestic arrears accumulation and/or of further postponing the
realization of public infrastructure projects. If materialized, this risk would result in
disorderly fiscal developments, heighten financial sector vulnerabilities, and adversely affect
economic growth. BEAC statutory advances remain a last-resort source of financing.15
However, the use of statutory advances would send inconsistent signals at a time when
BEAC is promoting the development of a regional market for government securities.
20.
The mission encouraged the authorities to accelerate the implementation of
ongoing administrative reforms to widen the tax base. Cameroon’s nonoil revenue
performance is still among the weakest in the region. Given that tax rates on capital income,
labor, and consumption are already high, broadening the tax base through tax administration
reforms is a key priority. Actions should therefore be directed to (i) helping taxpayers
through improved services offered by the medium- and small-enterprise tax payer centers;
(ii) further simplifying tax and customs procedures; and (iii) rationalizing tax incentive
schemes by formalizing eligibility criteria, and improving monitoring and evaluation of
beneficiaries of such incentives.

is also limited by the absence of a sizeable secondary market and of an option to refinance the bonds at the
BEAC.
15

Cameroon could still access up to CFAF 335 billion (2.8 percent of GDP).

16
B. Improving PFM Conditions
21.
Staff encouraged the authorities to strengthen public expenditure
management and improve expenditure efficiency. The authorities concurred that special
attention should be paid to (i) tackling the existing stock of arrears and other payment
obligations; (ii) preventing further accumulation of government payment obligations;
(iii) strengthening cash management; and (iv) enhancing the quality of public spending.
22.
Staff welcomed the start of an exhaustive audit of arrears and other central
government payment obligations. The new audit follows four partial ones implemented in
2005–10, from which a stock of about CFAF 178 billion (1.6 percent of GDP) is outstanding.
The mission stressed also the importance of defining and implementing a clear schedule for
the gradual settlement of audited arrears.
23.
To prevent further arrears and payment obligations, staff recommended the
following actions:


Establish a mechanism to monitor the level of commitments by (i) reducing the
number of authorizing officers; (ii) recentralizing the management of budget
commitments; and (iii) mandating a budget execution reporting system throughout
the expenditure chain.



Implement the 90-day rule for the definition of government arrears as
recommended under the CEMAC directive.



Maintain in future budgets the mechanism introduced in the 2011 budget to control
DENOs by requiring that those accumulated by a public entity in the current year
be paid the following year through the budget allocation for the entity responsible.



Pursue ongoing efforts to prepare the monthly fiscal reporting table (TOFE) on a
payment order basis, to improve the monitoring of payment obligations.

24.
There is also scope for improving cash management. Staff recommended
revising the current methodology used in preparing cash-flow plans by taking available
information on the pipeline of outstanding spending commitments and UPOs into account
systematically, in addition to budgeted expenditures. Staff emphasized also the need to abide
by the single treasury account rule, notably by limiting the use of the SNH as a payment
window for government operations.16

16

The mission estimated, in the absence of official data, that payments made by SNH on behalf of the
government totaled almost 1 percent of GDP in 2010.

17
25.
The implementation of the medium-term plan for the modernization of public
expenditure, adopted in 2009 with the support of donors, should be accelerated. As
progress so far remains insufficient, staff underscored the need to:


Implement a concrete strategy to improve absorptive capacity for public
investment programs, and build continuity for investment financing through
multiyear commitment appropriations. Staff thus welcomed the authorities’ plan to
establish a central unit for project feasibility studies and evaluation (SEDEF), and
encouraged using the incoming civil servants’ recruitment to strengthen execution
capacities.



Ensure that the public procurement process is competitive and minimize the
incidence of single-source contracts.



Pursue efforts to make the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF)
operational to facilitate the translation of PRSP priorities into annual budgets.
C. Safeguarding Financial System Stability

26.
Staff reiterated the risks to public finances and the economy arising from
banking sector vulnerabilities. It noted that the longer the current situation in financially
weak banks persists, the higher could become the costs to the government, and to the
credibility of supervisory institutions.


The authorities indicated their intention to pursue the restructuring of financially
weak banks, notably through (i) recovery of loans granted to borrowers related to
the main shareholders; (ii) removal of nonperforming loans; and
(iii) recapitalization through reputable investors taking a majority share in the
capital of banks involved. They underscored, however, the potential social and
political costs associated with these restructurings.



Staff advised the authorities to (i) closely monitor liquidity conditions to avoid any
suspension of payments by these banks; (ii) require full loss absorption by
previous shareholders; and (iii) pursue maximum recovery of loans owed by
related parties to minimize the financial costs to the government.

27.
The authorities agreed on the importance of reviewing the regulatory
framework and strengthening the supervision of financial institutions. Weaknesses in the
current framework for dealing with distressed banks have become increasingly apparent with
respect to (i) delays in the coordination between regional and national authorities on
corrective measures; (ii) lack of clear rules and triggers for intervention; (iii) long delays in
legal procedures; and (iv) the significant opportunity for interference afforded to
shareholders of insolvent banks. The authorities concurred with staff on the need to engage
CEMAC members in (i) strengthening the regional supervisor’s capacity; (ii) gradually
reducing the prudential ratios for credit risk concentration; (iii) improving regulations on loan

18
provisioning to allow for earlier recognition of expected losses; and (iv) defining clear rules
and decision mechanisms for the treatment of banks in difficulty.
28.
There has been some progress in removing obstacles to access to bank credit.
A central credit registry for banks is now in operation. A law on leasing, which would help
improve access of SMEs to credit, was enacted in December 2010. The Ministry of Finance
has established the obligation of publishing the list of licensed microfinance institutions.
However, work remains to be done on establishing a central credit registry for microfinance
institutions and improving contract enforcement by setting up a court for commercial matters
and facilitating out-of-court settlements.
29.
Staff and the authorities discussed the risks of creating state-sponsored
specialized financial institutions for agriculture and SME financing. These inherently
involve undiversified sectoral loan portfolios and risks of undue interference in their
management. The authorities recognized these risks but noted that the current problems of
access to credit could justify creating such institutions, with appropriate safeguards to
address the weaknesses and avoid the failures experienced in the past.
D. Addressing Infrastructure Gaps while Preserving Debt Sustainability
30.
Efforts are underway to alleviate infrastructure bottlenecks in energy, roads,
ports, water supply, and telecommunications. Projects in these sectors are expected to be
financed by a mix of external loans, domestic borrowing, and public–private partnership
(PPP).17 The authorities’ agenda to raise public capital spending will initially translate into
higher deficits and debt, but the resulting nonoil growth dividends should contribute to
maintaining a sustainable fiscal position. Staff analysis indicates that keeping the nonoil
primary deficit (in percent of nonoil GDP) in the range of 5 to 6 percent as an anchor for
fiscal policy during 2011-16 would be consistent with maintaining a sustainable public debt
profile and preserving a low risk of debt distress.
31.
While the DSA suggests Cameroon’s risk of debt distress remains low, there
are indications of vulnerability to external shocks. Public debt indicators remain at
comfortable levels, and external debt ratios are below the policy-dependent thresholds under
the baseline scenario and most stress tests. However, in the case of a large export shock, the
present value of external debt to exports ratio would result in small and temporary breach of
the threshold.18 In projecting new external borrowing, the DSA takes into account sizeable
17

A legal framework on PPPs, in place since 2006, still needs to be improved as it lacks provisions for
monitoring fiscal obligations of PPP contracts and for independent audits of PPP projects.
18

This assessment is slightly different from the 2010 DSA, which found the projected external debt ratios under
an export shock to approach but stay below the relevant threshold under the baseline scenario and all the stress
tests.

19
new commitments that have been signed by the authorities in 2010 and in 2011, for which
disbursements are assumed to be spread out over several years.19 The authorities concurred
with staff that avoiding renewed debt vulnerabilities would require keeping nonconcessional
borrowing in check, strengthening debt management practices, and widening the export base.
32.
The authorities are committed to strengthening public debt management. In
this context, staff therefore emphasized the need to


Strengthen monitoring by setting up a database on public enterprise debt (with and
without government guarantee) and conducting periodic audits of domestic arrears.



Enhance the capacity of the National Public Debt Committee (CNDP) to
coordinate and monitor the implementation of the national public debt strategy.



Continue to work with regional institutions to make the regional market for
government securities fully operational.
E. Boosting Competitiveness and the Business Environment

33.
Staff’s estimates based on four methodologies in line with the CGER
approaches do not provide compelling evidence of real effective exchange rate (REER)
misalignment (Appendix III). The REER depreciated by about 6 percent in 2010 (annual
average) following a depreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate by 4.5 percent
(owing to the depreciation of the euro against other major currencies during most of the year)
and a negative inflation differential (about 2 percent) between Cameroon and its trading
partners. The country’s external competitiveness is, however, clearly hampered by nonprice
factors, especially a weak business environment.
34.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ initiatives to strengthen the dialogue with the
private sector, in particular the Cameroon Business Forum. Efforts under way to
improve governance and transparency of the government budget, and to hold managers of
public resources accountable, could reduce the uncertainty surrounding the business and
regulatory framework (Box 3). Staff emphasized the need to support these efforts with
reforms preventing the accumulation of domestic government arrears.

19

Since the beginning of 2010 through end-April 2011, the authorities have signed 30 borrowing agreements
for a total amount equivalent to almost 6 percent of the 2010 GDP. At least fifteen of these new loans (about
4 percent of GDP) are nonconcessional.

20
Box 3. Ongoing Initiatives to Improve the Business Climate
The authorities’ actions have been focused on (i) intensifying the dialogue with the private sector
and implementing an agreed action plan; (ii) fighting corruption; and (iii) pursuing public
enterprise reforms.
Implementing the action plan to improve business climate. With IFC assistance, the Cameroon
Business Forum (CBF), created in 2009 as a platform for dialogue with the private sector, adopted
a matrix of measures to be implemented in 2010–11. These include several actions focused on
simplifying regulations and procedures for starting a business, paying taxes, dealing with
commercial litigation, cross-border trading, obtaining construction permits, and property access
and protection. A recent assessment concluded that half of the envisaged actions have been
completed. In particular, the number of steps to start a business have been reduced; procedures for
paying taxes simplified; services offered by the one-stop window for external trade have been
improved; the time required for provision of construction permits has been shortened; laws on ecommerce were enacted; and regional one-stop windows for delivery of property titles were
introduced.
Fighting corruption. Efforts in this area have intensified since 2009, leading to prosecution of
high-level officials charged with misappropriation of public funds. The authorities also stepped up
an anticorruption campaign.1 These efforts have still to generate tangible results in international
rankings.2
Public enterprise reforms. Progress has been mixed. The sale of 51 percent of the telephone
company (CAMTEL) and the selection of a strategic partner were inconclusive, and a new
divestiture strategy is being prepared. The restructuring of the postal service company
(CAMPOST) is ongoing, and the government signed a partnership agreement with a foreign
company in March 2010. The liquidation of the old public aviation company (CAMAIR) is being
completed. A new national airline (CAMAIR CO) launched its operations in March 2011 under
new management.
1

The adoption of the national anti-corruption strategy is, however, pending.
Cameroon’s rank on the Corruption Perceptions Index of Transparency International was 146th out of
178 countries in 2010. The World Bank Governance Indicators continue to rank Cameroon in the bottom
25th quartile.
2

35.
Progress on trade liberalization could help boost a more diversified nonoil
export base. Private investment and productivity growth remain constrained by high
customs duties and nonuniform implementation of regional trade regulations.20 Progress
needs to be made in regional negotiations on reducing the level and range of the common

20

With tariff rates of up to 30 percent and an unweighted average of about 19 percent, the CEMAC CET rates
are high in comparison with other countries and country groups, including those in Africa (See Kees Martijn
and Charalambos G. Tsangarides, “Trade Reform in the CEMAC: Developments and Opportunities,” IMF
Working Paper 07/137).

21
external tariff (CET), harmonizing the rules of products’ country of origin, and limiting CET
exemptions. The authorities broadly agreed, but noted the slow progress in coming to an
agreement with regional partners, and concerns over the potential reduction in customs
revenues.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
The economy is gradually recovering from the global crisis, and inflation
remains contained. While the overall macroeconomic situation is broadly stable, significant
risks stem from (i) uncertainty on the strength and duration of the global recovery;
(ii) persistent weaknesses in the public finances; (iii) increasing vulnerabilities in the banking
sector; (iv) failure to reach the projected increase in oil production; and (v) possible delays in
the implementation of needed reforms, given electoral concerns.
37.
Risks to the 2011 budget need to be urgently addressed. The 2011 budget is
under pressure from unsettled payment obligations and arrears to the oil refinery accumulated
in 2010, rising subsidies to support the freeze in retail fuel prices, and uncertainty in
mobilizing budgeted domestic financing through a second bond issuance. A sizable financing
gap could materialize. Fiscal policy in 2011 should be guided by a reprioritization of current
and capital spending and strict treasury management in order to close any residual financing
gap while avoiding a further accumulation of domestic arrears or an undue compression of
public investment.
38.
Improving PFM conditions and nonoil revenue mobilization remain critical to
maintaining stability. The authorities are encouraged to complete a comprehensive audit of
outstanding arrears, strengthen treasury management, rebuild fiscal buffers gradually, and
establish mechanisms to monitor the level of commitments and to improve the tracking of
spending flows through the budget execution process. Scope exists for pursuing higher
nonoil revenue by broadening the tax base, streamlining tax exemptions, and further
increasing the efficiency of tax and customs administration.
39.
The authorities need to remain vigilant against banking sector risks. The
financially-weak condition of some domestic banks and the accumulation of unsettled
payment obligations by the government continue to pose a risk to financial stability. In
collaboration with the regional supervisory institution, the authorities are advised to take
resolute steps to (i) monitor vulnerabilities through regular analysis of banking sector
soundness indicators; (ii) promote a sound and rapid restructuring plan for banks in
difficulty, while minimizing costs for the public finances; and (iii) champion a reform of the
legal framework for bank resolution.

22

40.
Strengthening regional financial institutions remains a priority for Cameroon.
Staff encourages the authorities to continue to press for BEAC governance reforms, through
their various representatives in the regional bank governance bodies, and to support BEAC’s
program to strengthen risk mitigating safeguards.
41.
Addressing the severe infrastructure gaps and improving the business climate
are critical to achieving higher and sustained growth over the medium term. Achieving
these objectives will require defining and implementing a concrete strategy to raise the
execution rate for public investment, deepening the dialogue with the private sector and
implementing actions agreed within the Cameroon Business Forum, improving governance,
and tackling corruption. Staff estimates do not provide evidence of exchange rate
misalignment for Cameroon, but competitiveness remains hampered by a weak business
environment and insufficient provision of public services.
42.
Maintaining a prudent borrowing policy is necessary to preserve debt
sustainability. The updated LIC-DSA shows that Cameroon’s risk of debt distress remains
low. However, the recent surge in nonconcessional borrowing to finance major infrastructure
projects, if not used wisely, could jeopardize public debt sustainability in the medium to
longer term. The authorities need to rely, to the extent possible, on grants and highly
concessional loans for financing their investment program. They are also encouraged to work
closely with regional institutions in developing a regional market for government securities, a
key step in reducing vulnerability to external financing shocks.
43.

Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation take place within 12 months.

APPENDIX I—Fuel Subsidies: Current Issues and the Way Forward
A. Current Issues Regarding Fuel Subsidies
1.

Since the February 2008 social unrest, fuel prices at the pump have not been adjusted
to reflect developments in international market conditions. The price freeze was accompanied by
a decision to compensate the domestic oil refinery (SONARA) for the shortfall between the notional
retail price derived from the existing oil pricing formula and the administratively fixed price at the
pump.1

2.
Cameroon exports the bulk of its heavy domestic crude oil production. SONARA’s
current processing capacity is approximately 2.1 million tons of light crude.2 Because its current
technology is unsuitable for using Cameroon’s crude oil, about 90 percent of processed crude oil is
imported from Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea. The refinery produced about 1.8 million tons of
refined products in 2009, of which 63 percent was sold domestically. The remainder was sold mostly
to other CEMAC countries.3
3.
The government has been accumulating substantial arrears on compensating SONARA
for the shortfall since 2008. These arrears amounted to CFAF 98 billion (about 0.9 percent of
GDP) at end-2009. In 2010, although the government paid the refinery CFAF 107 billion,

cumulative payment obligations to SONARA reached about CFAF 136 billion at year-end
(1.2 per cent of GDP).
4.
The fuel subsidy adds a significant burden to the budget. According to the authorities’
calculations, were international fuel prices to remain at March 2011 levels (US$100 a barrel) and the
regulated pricing mechanism not revisited (Box 1), the subsidy would amount to CFAF 240 billion
(2 percent of GDP) in 2011, markedly exceeding the CFAF 132 billion provision made in the 2011
budget.4 Putting these data into context, the estimated shortfall for 2011 is equivalent to 10 percent of
total government expenditure, more than one third of the public sector wage bill, or half of
domestically-financed government capital expenditure.

1

SONARA is the only significant supplier to the local market because imports are limited to 20 percent of total
consumption. Owing to importers’ difficulties in recovering the subsidies, only about one quarter of the import
quota has been used.

2

It is useful to compare SONARA’s output of refined oil products with that of the Ivory Coast’s refinery, which
produces 4 million tons a year, and the smallest French refinery, which produces 10 million tons.

SONARA, Annual Report 2009.

The calculation assumes a monthly consumption of 39, 7, and 49 million liters for gasoline, kerosene, and
diesel, respectively.

35
Box 1: Calculating the Fuel Subsidy
The fuel subsidy is calculated through a pricing formula in place since 2007.1 In the absence of a
competitive local market for fuel products, the formula calculates a local wholesale price for final
products (g) by adding to the prevailing world reference price (a):

international transport and insurance costs (b) to arrive at an import parity price (c);

an adjustment coefficient (e) of 15 percent of the import parity price to provide compensation
(de facto a producer subsidy) to SONARA;2

taxes (d) including a 10 per cent customs duty and 19.25 percent VAT; and

coastal navigation costs (f).
The notional retail price (j) is calculated by adding distribution costs and margins (h) and a specific
tax (i)—for gasoline and diesel only—to the wholesale price. The formula calculates the shortfall
(subsidy) per liter of final product (l) as the difference between the notional retail price and the fixed
pump price (k).3

The formula was developed in collaboration with the IMF and is applied to three products: gasoline, kerosene,
and diesel. The subsidy per liter is recalculated on a monthly basis.

2

The adjustment factor reflects mostly the higher costs of the local refinery (SONARA) compared to
internationally-competitive refineries. Part of the reason for SONARA’s lower efficiency is its low production
volume. With significant investment, SONARA intends to increase production capacity to a level that would
bring production volumes to the efficiency threshold.

3

Margins for transport and distribution are de facto fixed.

36
5.
The fuel subsidy is badly targeted, and the associated resources could be
redeployed to generate significantly higher benefits for the poor. A 2007 IMF assessment
showed that more than 70 percent of fuel price subsidies accrue to the richest 40 percent of
households.5 The study also showed that the poorest 20 percent of households receive less
than 1 percent of the subsidy for gasoline. And even in the case of kerosene subsidies, which
are typically assumed to be pro-poor, the poorest 20 percent of households receive only
13 percent of the subsidy. In addition, the consumption of kerosene is small compared to the
consumption of gasoline and diesel. Eliminating subsidies on gasoline and diesel only—at
the baseline price of US$100 a barrel—would free resources equivalent to 1.8 percent of
GDP for alternative use, including social spending to mitigate the impact of fuel price
increases on the poor. The remaining subsidy on kerosene would cost about 0.2 percent of
GDP to the budget.
6.
The oil sector remains a net contributor to the government budget, but its
contribution is on a declining trend because of the rising cost of the fuel subsidy
mechanism. From 2008 to 2010, revenue from crude oil declined from 7.6 percent to
4.5 percent of GDP. The projected increase in revenue from crude oil in 2011 will be more
than offset by the rising cost of the required fuel subsidy under the current fuel price policy
(Table 2). Tax revenues on refined petroleum products have contributed on average
1.7 percent of GDP.

If the international fuel price were to rise by 30 percent, compared to the
baseline price, the cost of the subsidy could amount to 3.4 percent of GDP
(CFAF 408 billion). Figure 1 shows the variation in the cost of the subsidy under different
assumptions for world oil prices. Staff estimates indicate that international fuel prices would
have to fall by about 50 percent on average, compared to the March 2011 level, to eliminate
the subsidy.

The fuel pricing formula also raises two important issues:



The margin for SONARA increases with climbing world market prices. Setting the
margin on an ad valorem basis leads to increasing government transfers to SONARA
as international fuel prices increase, even at constant volumes of domestic
consumption.6



The impact of any price fluctuation in world markets on the shortfall is magnified by
the link between the world market price, the tax structure, and the margin for
SONARA. An increase of 10 percent in the import parity price leads to an increase of
at least 23 percent in the shortfall (taking account of the additional impact of customs
and VAT as well as the adjustment coefficient for SONARA).

6

SONARA exports refined products to the extent that they are not absorbed by the domestic market. These
products are sold at international market prices.

38
B. The Way Forward
9.
The government intends to revise the pricing formula to reduce the cost of the
subsidy. Options under consideration include (i) reducing the supplementary margin for
SONARA and/or (ii) revising or eliminating other cost factors in the calculation of import
parity, for example the cost of using SONARA’s port facilities or the dead freight. Staff
estimates indicate that if the margin for SONARA had been reduced from 15 percent to
10 percent at end-2010, the estimated shortfall for 2011 would be reduced from
CFAF 240 billion to CFAF 218 billion (a reduction of 9 percent).
10.
More comprehensive reforms would be required to significantly reduce the
burden of fuel subsidies on the budget, and to use limited resources more efficiently.
These reforms could include


Modifying the margin for SONARA and effectively liberalizing imports of
refined oil products. To solve the subsidy problem, the link between local and
international price levels should be reestablished. In a first step the supplementary
margin should be delinked from international fuel price levels by setting (based on
the SONARA cost structure) a specific nominal transfer per liter of final product. In a
second step, SONARA should be competing with international providers and thus
selling its products domestically at international prices. Any consequent losses should
be financed through direct budgetary transfers, preferably within a clear medium-term
strategy for reforming the structure of the petroleum product sector. This reform
should take into account SONARA’s ongoing efforts to reduce its costs by upgrading
its equipment.



Gradually phasing out the fuel subsidy by moving to automatic price adjustment
and establishing an effective social protection mechanism. A substantially more
cost-effective approach to protecting the income of the poor would involve putting in
place targeted transfer programs at the same time as fuel prices are increased in line
with international price levels. Thus, the automatic pricing mechanism for consumer
prices should be reintroduced, removing the subsidies according to a clear timeline.
At the same time, targeted mitigating measures should be put in place to compensate
the poor for the loss in purchasing power. Given the need to develop the capacity of
the various ministries to design and implement effective and well-targeted transfer
and expenditure programs, a gradual approach to fuel subsidy reform is warranted.

39

APPENDIX II—Banking System Vulnerabilities
A.

Structure of the Deposit-Taking Financial System

1.
Twelve commercial banks operate in Cameroon and together represent more
than 40 percent of assets and deposits in the CEMAC region. At end-2010, more than
half of Cameroon’s gross commercial bank credit was concentrated in five subsidiaries of
large international banking groups, with the three largest (subsidiaries of French banks, with
minority shareholdings by the Cameroon government) accounting for most of that market
share (Table 1). Three domestically-controlled banks, including the second largest bank in
the country, had a joint market share of 32 percent of banking system credit and about
27 percent of total bank deposits. The remaining 13 percent of the credit market was covered
by four relatively small subsidiaries of Nigerian and Togolese banking groups. There are no
state-owned commercial banks in Cameroon.
2.
Nonbank deposit-taking institutions play a relatively minor role. The
microfinance sector as of end-2008 comprised 460 institutions with total deposits and loans
equivalent to about 11 percent of the corresponding banking system totals. There is also a
public nonbank deposit-taking institution, Crédit Foncier du Cameroun (CFC), which was
created to finance social housing and was historically financed mostly by a 2.5 percent
deduction from public and private sector salaries. Its customer deposits amount to less than
1 percent of banking system deposits.
B.

Banking System Soundness and Vulnerabilities

3.
Aggregate bank financial soundness indicators show a significant
deterioration during 2010. On a system-wide average basis, the capital adequacy ratio
(CAR) went down from about 10 percent in 2009 to 7 percent in 2010 of risk-weighted
assets, partly reflecting the recognition of losses in two financially-weak banks.
Nonperforming loans (NPLs) went up from 13 percent to 15 percent of total gross loans, the
ratio of total provisions to NPLs fell from 79 percent to 75 percent, leading to an increase in
uncovered NPLs (i.e., net of total provisions) from 24 percent to 44 percent of net worth. The
low level of coverage of NPLs by provisions at some banks suggests that their reported
CARs may overstate their actual capitalization conditions.
4.
A few domestically-or regionally-controlled banks are in weak financial
condition. Two institutions need to be recapitalized and some banks have vulnerabilities
stemming from low provisioning for NPLs. In contrast, the five subsidiaries of large
international banking groups covering 56 percent of Cameroon’s bank credit market appear
robustly capitalized. All banks show relatively high liquidity (the ratio of liquid assets to
deposits averaged 47 percent in 2010).

40
5.
Credit concentration with respect to public enterprises is important. As of
end-2010, total risk-weighted credit exposure to the three strategic public enterprises
represented more than 70 percent of regulatory capital in five banks.1 However,
risk-weighted credit exposure to individual public enterprises exceeded the regulatory credit
concentration limit of 45 percent of regulatory capital at three banks (in all three cases to the
oil refinery).
6.
Delays in government payments may be affecting private sector bank
borrowers. Such accumulated government payment obligations amounted to about
2.4 percent of GDP at end-2010. As a result, the repayment capacity of affected borrowers
could be compromised. Data were not available to assess the magnitude of these affected
exposures to the banking system.
7.
Banking sector vulnerabilities are also heightened by the poor business
climate. Risks in lending to the private sector (especially to SMEs) are increased by
uncertain property rights and weak enforcement of creditor rights. The result is a bias toward
concentration of credit risks in a few large companies (mostly state-owned) and toward
related-party lending.
C.

Regional Framework for Bank Regulation, Supervision, and Resolution

8.
Important shortcomings in key prudential regulations and in supervisory capacities
identified in the 2006 FSAP and 2008 FSAP update remain unaddressed. Provisioning rules
allow for up to four years before NPLs are fully provisioned. Moreover, staffing constraints
at the regional supervisory institution result in on-site examinations of Cameroonian banks at
an average frequency of between three and four years, leaving scope for insufficient loan-loss
provisioning and for inadequate identification of risks. Further, the limit on exposure to a
single borrower and related parties of 45 percent of the regulatory capital is much higher than
best practice (15 percent to 25 percent) and is routinely expanded to up to 90 percent for
“strategic enterprises.”
9.
Weaknesses in the regional bank resolution framework have become more evident
through recent difficulties in dealing with distressed banks. These weaknesses relate to (i) the
potential for coordination problems between regional and local authorities to delay required
prompt corrective action; (ii) the lack of clear rules and triggers for intervention;
(iii) excessively long delays before key decisions can be made; and (iv) excessive room for
interference by shareholders of insolvent banks in restructuring cases. The regional
supervisor is currently working on a reform of the bank resolution framework.

APPENDIX III—External Competitiveness in Cameroon
The results of four different quantitative methodologies used to assess Cameroon’s real effective
exchange rate (REER) are inconclusive, and the estimates tend to be associated with wide confidence
intervals. There is thus no compelling evidence to suggest that Cameroon’s REER is misaligned.
These methodologies were complemented by a range of survey data, showing that Cameroon’s
competitiveness remains clearly hampered by structural obstacles, mostly related to a weak business
environment, corruption, and high costs of services.
A.

REER Assessment

1.
During 2010, Cameroon’s nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) depreciated by 4.5
percent, while the real effective exchange rate (REER) based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI)
depreciated by 6.3 percent. This offset the appreciation registered between 2006 and 2009 (Figure 1).
The decline in the NEER primarily resulted from the depreciation of the euro (to which the CFAF is
pegged) against other major currencies. Cameroon’s REER, as measured using unit labor costs in the
manufacturing sector, shows a similar trend, and also registered a depreciation of around 6 percent in
2010.

2.
The exchange rate assessment, using four different methodologies, shows mixed results.
The external sustainability and macroeconomic balance approaches point to an overvalued REER,
while the equilibrium REER and the Balassa-Samuelson approaches suggest an undervalued

43
REER.1 The macroeconomic balance approach estimates a current account norm using some of the
fundamental determinants of the current account balance (CAB) to GDP ratio.2 Staff estimates
resulted in a norm equivalent to a current account deficit of 1 percent of GDP. The estimated
adjustment necessary in the REER to close the gap between the norm and the staff’s projected CAB
at the end of the WEO projection period (2016) suggests that a REER depreciation of around
15 percent would be required. However, the 90 percent confidence interval is wide and includes
zero.
3.
For oil-producing countries, alternative methodologies have been developed to take into
account the expected return on oil wealth in deriving the current account norm in the macroeconomic
balance approach. While oil continues to be important for Cameroon in terms of exports, accounting
for close to 55 percent of total exports during 2000–09, it represents a relatively small share of total
output, accounting for around 7.4 percent of GDP in the same period. Moreover, oil production is
projected to decline gradually. These two elements make the conclusions in terms of exchange rate
misalignment relatively insensitive to the inclusion of the return on oil wealth in the estimation of the
current account norm.
4.
The external sustainability approach, which estimates the CAB to GDP ratio needed to
stabilize the net foreign asset (NFA) position of a country at Cameroon’s NFA position in 2009,3
finds that the REER would need to depreciate by around 13 percent.
5.
The equilibrium REER approach, which is based on the estimation of the medium-term
relationship between the REER and its fundamentals,4 suggests that Cameroon’s REER is
undervalued by almost 13 percent. Again, the 90 percent confidence interval is wide and includes
zero.
6.
The fourth approach is based on the Balassa-Samuelson effect, according to which
countries with higher levels of per capita income experience higher productivity growth in the

1

The estimates of each of the four methods are presented in the lines in Figure 2, which shows the point estimates as well
as the upper and lower bounds of the 90 percent confidence interval around each of the estimates.

The determinants included in the regression as independent variables are the relative old age dependency ratio, relative
population growth, relative income, relative output growth, oil trade balance, relative fiscal balance, initial net foreign
assets, aid inflows, and remittance inflows. See Francis Vitek (2011), “Exchange Rate Assessment Tools for Advanced,
Emerging, and Developing Economies,” mimeo, International Monetary Fund, April 2011.

This NFA position is for Cameroon’s economy as a whole, not just for the banking system. Data are taken from the
updated and extended version of the Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2007) dataset. See Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2007), “The
External Wealth of Nations Mark II: Revised and Extended Estimates of Foreign Assets and Liabilities, 1970–2004,”

tradable goods sector and thus a more appreciated level of the REER.5 The results of this approach
suggest that the REER in Cameroon is undervalued by 12 percent. Again, the 90 percent confidence
interval is very wide and includes zero.

B. Survey Data Analysis
7.
Traditional methods for the exchange rate assessment were complemented with a range of
survey data, to avoid drawing inferences based on a single, specific indicator.
8.
The Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) ranks Cameroon 110 out of 139 surveyed
countries. Cameroon ranks lower than the sub-Saharan African (SSA) average for all the dimensions
of the index, especially for quality of institutions, degree of local market competition, and financial
market development (Figure 3). With respect to the business environment, Cameroon slightly
improved its ranking in the 2011 World Bank Doing Business Indicators (to 168, from 171 in 2010),
although it again ranks below the SSA average (Table 1). According to the World Bank Enterprise
Survey (2009), Cameroonian firms identify practices undertaken by competitors in the informal
market, tax administration, and access to finance and to electricity as major constraints (Figure 4).
Access to credit, taxation, and corruption are seen as major impediments in the Recensement General
des Enterprises (2009), conducted by Cameroon’s Ministry of Economy. The 2010 Enabling Trade

5

WP/07/296.

45
Index (ETI) ranks the country below the SSA average (Figure 5), with transport and
communications’ infrastructure identified as major constraints.6
9.
Patterns for cross-country comparisons of infrastructure endowment and costs are mixed.
World Bank infrastructure access indicators place Cameroon better than or in line with CEMAC and
SSA’s LICs for mobile telephone lines but below for internet access (Table 2). The country’s road
density is, however, substantially lower than the SSA average (Figure 6). In terms of costs of
infrastructure, Cameroon has one of the highest tariffs for power and road freight in SSA, while
charges for mobile communication, internet access, and container freight are close to the SSA
countries’ average (Table 3).
Data from the World Bank Enterprise Survey indicate that more than 60 percent of
Cameroonian firms surveyed identify corruption as a major constraint to business (for all SSA, this
share is 35 percent). Most enterprises surveyed claim they are expected to provide informal payments
to public officials or to give gifts to secure a government contract, with the incidence of this
phenomenon much higher than for all SSA (Table 4).
10.

In sum, most of these survey data show that Cameroon’s overall business environment is
holding back its competitiveness.

On border administration, the World Bank Enterprise Survey (2009) shows that in Cameroon the average time for
import clearance is 24 days, almost the double of the time needed in the rest of SSA countries (12.7 days). Furthermore,
regarding the inefficiencies of port administration, a World Bank study indicates that the dwell time in the port of Douala
exceeded 20 days on average in 2010, compared to a global benchmark of 3 to 4 days agreed on by sector experts, and
11 days set in the concession contract signed in 2005 with the port management entity. See Refas and Cantens, “Why
Does Cargo Spend Weeks in African Ports? The Case of Douala, Cameroon,” Policy Research Working Paper 5565, The
World Bank, February 2011.

CAMEROON
Joint Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis1
Prepared by the Staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association
Approved by Seán Nolan and Dhaneshwar Ghura (IMF) and
Jeffrey D. Lewis and Marcelo Giugale (World Bank)
June 9, 2011
While Cameroon’s risk of debt distress remains low, there are indications of vulnerability to
external shocks. This joint IMF-World Bank low-income country debt sustainability analysis
(LIC-DSA) follows up on the LIC-DSA prepared in 2010 and integrates the authorities’
intentions to increase temporarily infrastructure investment through external borrowing, part
of which is to be on nonconcessional terms. Total public debt indicators remain at
comfortable levels, and all external debt ratios remain well below the policy-dependent
indicative thresholds under the baseline scenario, as well as under three of the four stress
tests. A breach in the threshold occurs in the case of an extreme export shock. In addition,
there has been a fast pace of accumulation of nonconcessional borrowing commitments since
early 2010. These new signs of debt vulnerability call for a cautious approach to
nonconcessional borrowing, and stress the importance of strengthening debt management,
enhancing nonoil revenue mobilization, and widening the export base in light of the
anticipated long-run decline of oil revenues.
I. BACKGROUND
1.
This report follows up the debt sustainability analysis (DSA) prepared in 2010
(IMF Country Report No. 10/259). The underlying macroeconomic framework reflects the
latest IMF Article IV discussions with the authorities (March 2011). Since the 2010 DSA,

1

Prepared by IMF and World Bank staffs in collaboration with the Cameroonian authorities. Debt data,
sustainability issues, and the new debt limit policy were discussed with the authorities in the course of the 2011
Article IV consultation. This DSA follows the IMF and World Bank Staff Guidance Note on the Application of
the Joint Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries, January 22, 2010 (available at
http://www.imf.org/external/pp/longres.aspx?id=4419 and http://go.worldbank.org/JBKAT4BH40). The
analysis revises the 2010 DSA (IMF Country Report for Cameroon 10/259, available at
http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=24126.0 ). This DSA is conservatively undertaken on
gross (as opposed to net) basis as no data on Cameroon’s claims are available.

2
Cameroon has been slowly recovering from the adverse effects of the global crisis. After
declining in 2009, due to the drop in commodity prices and volumes, Cameroonian exports
rebounded in 2010. The recovery of nonoil sectors contributed to the increase in the real
GDP growth to 3.2 percent in 2010, from 2 percent in 2009.
2.
The DSA is based on end-2010 data provided by the Cameroonian authorities.
The debt data currently cover central government external debt and an estimate of domestic
debt. Despite efforts to improve debt statistics, the coverage of liabilities of public
enterprises and municipalities, contingent liabilities of financial institutions, and
government obligations to parastatal entities remains uneven.2

3.
Cameroon’s debt situation has improved in the last five years. The public
debt-to-GDP ratio declined from about 52 percent in 2005 to 10 percent in 2008, thanks to
HIPC and MDRI relief in 2006 and prudent borrowing policies since then (Text Table 1). In
recent years, the maintenance of low levels of external debt reflects (i) a reduction in external
borrowing by public enterprises; (ii) the settlement of most outstanding debt to commercial
creditors; and (iii) limited disbursements from commitments owing to low execution rates of
public investment.
4.
The authorities’ medium-term strategy includes stepping up public investment.
Limited infrastructure is perceived as a major bottleneck to achieving the faster economic
growth rates needed to reduce poverty sustainably. Infrastructure spending, especially in
transportation and power generation, can play a critical role in stimulating sectors vital to
growth in Cameroon.3 Financing for the additional public spending is expected to come from
2

A few Cameroonian banks are currently in weak financial condition. Recapitalization needs have been
estimated at CFAF 60 billion (0.5 percent of GDP) for one distressed bank and are still uncertain in the case of
two weak smaller banks. The authorities are in the process of recovering nonperforming loans and attracting
private investors to the weak banks in order to minimize the government’s contribution to the banks’
recapitalization. Staff has included a tentative government contribution of 0.2 percent of GDP in the fiscal
projections for 2011 and factored it into the DSA.
3
Calderon (2009) suggests for instance that annual real GDP growth in Cameroon could increase by
4 ½ percentage points if the level of its infrastructure were to be upgraded to that of Mauritius (the country
having the best infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa). See Calderón, C. 2009, “Infrastructure and Growth in
Africa,” Policy Research Working Paper 4914, World Bank, Washington, D.C.

a combination of domestic and external borrowings. While the authorities will continue to
seek concessional borrowing, these resources will be insufficient and authorities will be
under pressure to turn to nonconcessional sources of financing.
5.
The debt stock has been on an upward trend since 2008. The rise in external debt
has been generated by some increase in external borrowing by the central government and
public enterprises. Domestic debt has been boosted by the outcome of the audits completed
in 2009 and 2010, and by the issuance of a CFAF 200 billion government bond, of which
CFAF 158 billion were subscribed by residents (Figure 1).4
6.
Debt indicators are nevertheless lower than projected in the 2010 DSA. The ratio
of total public debt to GDP at end-2010 (12 percent) was lower than envisaged in the 2010
DSA (13.4 percent). The lower ratio is explained by higher-than-projected nominal GDP, and
lower than previously anticipated level of new domestic and external borrowing (Text
Table 2). The lower new borrowing is mostly due to the fact that the previously projected
financing gap was not met with new loans, but was resolved by a compression of public
investment spending and by the accumulation of payment obligations, notably to the oil
refinery SONARA.

Domestic debt does not include unsettled payment obligations (notably to the oil refinery). These are in fact
not recognized as part of domestic debt by the authorities and would increase its level by 3.6 percent of GDP.

7.
The composition of external public debt is skewed toward multilateral debt.
Following HIPC/MDRI debt relief in 2006, the share of bilateral debt became predominant.5
However, reflecting the impact of the crisis, the share of multilateral lenders has increased
more recently with the provision of Fund assistance under the RAC-ESF facility in 2009 and
increased disbursements from IDA and the AfDB in 2010 (Figure 1).6
II. THE DSA BASELINE SCENARIO
8.
Relative to the 2010 DSA, the baseline macroeconomic framework incorporates
a gradual recovery from the crisis, more optimistic assumptions on the oil price, and
higher external nonconcessional borrowing. Medium-term projections of real GDP
growth, fiscal revenue, and exports have been revised upward, on account of an expected

5

The share of bilateral debt dropped from 53 percent of the total in 2006 to 32.4 percent in 2010.
IDA and AfDB disbursements increased by about CFAF 46 billion and CFAF 32 billion in 2010, relative to
2009.

pick up in oil production. Long-term projections, however, are broadly unchanged (Text
Table 3).7
9.
Overall outstanding debt is projected to be lower than in the previous DSA for
the medium term, while higher in the long term. A lower level of debt in the medium
term reflects that, in contrast to the 2010 DSA, no financing gap is assumed for 2012–16;
conversely, higher debt in the longer term is associated with a gradual increase of new
external borrowing (including on nonconcessional terms) to help finance infrastructure
investments, in line with the authorities’ stated intentions. The authorities have developed a
list of priority high-return infrastructure projects in key sectors. Growth-enhancing
investment projects are also expected to be partly financed through foreign direct investment
and other private capital flows financing public-private partnerships (PPPs).

During January 2010–April 2011, the authorities contracted 30 borrowing agreements, equivalent to almost
6 percent of 2010 GDP. At least 15 of these new loans were nonconcessional, with an average grant element of
21.3 percent. Future nonconcessional borrowings are assumed to have an average grant element of 20 percent.

6
commitments to reach CFAF 855 billion in 2011 (7 percent of GDP) and CFAF 994 billion
(7.7 percent of GDP) in 2012 (Text Table 4). These commitments will be mostly aimed at
alleviating infrastructure bottlenecks in energy, roads, ports, and water supply. Detailed
information provided by the authorities indicates that 78 percent and 75 percent of the new
commitments in 2011 and 2012, respectively, would be nonconcessional.9 Staffs assume that
new borrowing commitments after 2012 will decline gradually to 3 percent of GDP by 2016.
Concerning disbursements from outstanding commitments, a rate of 15 percent has been
assumed for 2011, based on the average of previous years’ ratios. For 2012–16, the
disbursement rate is projected to be equal to 10 percent in light of the volume of contracts
that are at stake, which may challenge absorption capacity, and of the projects involved,
which have a long-term realization horizon. Taking into account the composition of
outstanding and projected stocks of external commitments, the share of nonconcessional
disbursements is projected to increase gradually from 20 percent in 2011 to 60 percent in
2014, and 80 percent in 2031 (Text Table 5).

Total nonconcessional new borrowing commitments in 2011-12 are projected at CFAF 1,406 billion. This
DSA will provide input to World Bank staff in order for them to establish ceilings for nonconcessional
borrowing (NCB) in 2011 and 2012, under the IDA’s nonconcessional borrowing policies.

Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions for the Baseline Scenario1
Higher projected oil prices and the expected rebound in nonoil exports have led to an upward revision of
real GDP growth for 2011 to 3.8 percent. Growth is expected to increase gradually to 5 percent by 2014
on assumptions of a temporary rebound in oil output in the near-term and increased capital spending.
Longer-term growth is expected to average 4.6 percent for 2016–31, as in the 2010 DSA, and would be
driven by the expansion in nonoil sectors. Average consumer price-based inflation is expected to
stabilize at about 2.5 percent over the medium-term, in line with recent historical trend and CEMAC
convergence criteria.
Government revenues are projected to reflect the volatility of oil revenues, which are expected to pick
up from 4.5 percent of GDP in 2010 to 6 percent of GDP in 2014 and to steadily decline to about
0.4 percent of GDP by the end of the projection period. Nonoil revenues are projected to rise from about
12.3 percent of nonoil GDP in 2010 to almost 16 percent by 2031, reflecting sustained implementation
of measures to strengthen tax and custom administrations. The nonoil primary deficit is projected to stay
in the range of 5 percent to 6 percent of nonoil GDP in 2011–16 and to gradually decline, reaching
almost zero towards the end of the projected period. Net of public investment spending, the nonoil
primary balance would improve from a deficit of 3.4 percent of nonoil GDP in 2010, turning into a
surplus in 2021 and reaching 3 percent in 2031. This path is consistent with an expected higher control
of current spending, increasing allocations for public infrastructure, and improvements in public
financial management, including improving expenditure execution in priority areas.
The external current account deficit, including grants, is projected to remain in the range of 2-4 percent
of GDP. The volume growth of nonoil exports is projected, as in the previous DSA, to increase from
4.6 percent in 2011 to an average of more than 9 percent for the rest of the period. The growth in import
volume is projected to reflect the acceleration of real GDP growth in 2011-14, and also takes into
account the increase in imports of equipment and intermediate goods for the implementation of
infrastructure projects. The current account deficit is expected to be financed through foreign direct
investment, external public borrowing, and other private capital inflows.

The baseline scenario uses the latest IMF World Economic Outlook assumptions (May 2011).

III. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

Baseline Scenario
11.
The LIC debt sustainability framework is guided by country-specific indicative
debt burden thresholds for external debt, based on the strength of a country’s policies
and institutions. These thresholds reflect the empirical findings that sustainable debt levels
for a low-income country increase with the quality of its policies and institutions. Such
quality is measured by the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index,
compiled annually by the World Bank. Based on its three-year moving average CPIA score,
despite being at the SSA average and above the CEMAC average, Cameroon ranks as a

8
‘weak performer’ under the joint IMF/World Bank debt sustainability framework (Text
Table 6).10 The indicative external debt burden thresholds for countries in this category are a
present value (PV) of debt-to-exports ratio of 100 percent, a PV of debt-to-revenue ratio of
200 percent, a PV of debt-to-GDP ratio of 30 percent, and debt service-to-exports and
revenues ratios of 15 percent and 25 percent, respectively.11

12.
The DSA calculations indicate that Cameroon’s external debt is sustainable.
Under the baseline scenario, all debt indicators remain below their thresholds over the
projection horizon (Text Table 7 and Figure 2).12 The gradual rise in the PV of
debt-to-exports ratio reflects the assumption that Cameroon will continue to borrow to
finance infrastructure, and will also have gradually less access to new borrowing on
concessional terms. Figure 2 also shows that debt-service ratios would increase after 2020
but that the debt situation would remain manageable.

10

The CPIA rating ranges from 1 (weak performer) to 6 (strong performer). Based on a three-year average of
the CPIA rating, an average score at or above 3.75 corresponds to strong performance; an average score higher
than 3.25 and less than 3.75 reflects medium performance; and an average score at or below 3.25 corresponds to
poor policy performance. Cameroon's CPIA rating declined from 3.3 in 2005 to 3.2 in 2006, a rating
corresponding to weak performance, and has remained at that level for the last three years. The downgrade was
the result of deterioration in the following areas: business regulatory environment, policies and institutions for
environmental sustainability, structural policy cluster, and efficiency of revenue mobilization.
11
The 2011 LIC-DSA template gives the option to add remittances to exports of goods and services and show
the present value of external debt to the total of exports of goods and services and remittances, with a threshold
of 90 percent. Since for Cameroon the amount of remittances is far below the required 10 percent of GDP (it
was estimated at 0.04 percent of GDP during 2007–09), the threshold of PV of external debt to exports of 100 is
retained.
12
The discount rate has been maintained at 4 percent, consistent with the latest LIC-DSA template.

Alternative Scenario and Stress Tests
13.
Alternative scenarios and bound tests show that debt indicators remain below
their thresholds over the projection horizon, except for the large export shock
scenario. The historical scenario, which is associated with past current account surpluses, is
unlikely to occur, as oil production is expected to taper off in the next 20 years. This
scenario shows a more optimistic debt ratio trajectory relative to the baseline. Thus, in terms
of the risk assessment, the historical scenario is not relevant and will not be considered in
this analysis, as in the 2010 DSA.
14.
The alternative low-growth scenario indicates that Cameroon’s external debt
dynamics is sensitive to the assumption on real GDP growth. An alternative downside
scenario assuming a growth rate of 2 percentage points below the baseline is considered for
all the projection period (A3 in Table 2a). On a technical level, this scenario could reflect a
situation in which the additional infrastructure investment does not produce any substantial
impact on growth. This alternative scenario results in a PV of debt-to-GDP ratio of
17 percent by 2031, which is higher than the baseline scenario and highlights the need for
institutions to support a sound debt management strategy and create conditions for strong
returns on infrastructure investment.
15.
An export shock would be a source of increased debt vulnerability, resulting in
a small and temporary breach of the threshold. The export stress test suggested in the
DSA template (exports growth in US$ terms in 2012–13 at 1 standard deviation below the
10-year historical average) could be associated with a large drop in oil price or in external
demand in the nonoil exports coming from a new global crisis. The stress test assumes a

10
drop of 6.7 percent in the value of exports in both 2012 and 2013 and a return to the growth
rates assumed in the baseline scenario thereafter.13 Although the drop is less than in the
previous DSA, the magnitude of the shock is much larger than before because of the
stronger export performance projected in the baseline for 2012–13. Hence, the amount of
new borrowing required to compensate for the effects of the shock is higher than in the 2010
DSA, leading to a breach in the threshold of less than 5 percent over 2020–25 (Figure 2).
IV. PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
16.
The DSA baseline shows that public debt sustainability will continue to be
preserved. It is assumed that new domestic debt will be generated only by issuance of
government securities and bank financing of half of the projected financing gap in 2011.
New government securities issuance in the domestic market started in 2010 (consistent with
authorities’ plans), and amounted to CFAF 200 billion (1.7 percent of GDP), of which
CFAF 158 billion were subscribed by non-residents. New bond issuances are projected to
amount to up to CFAF 100 billion each year during 2012–14.14 In the baseline scenario, the
public debt ratio rises gradually in the medium term to 17.8 percent of GDP by 2021, driven
by both new domestic and external borrowings. The level of public debt would then
gradually decline to near 14 percent in 2031. The PV of debt-to-GDP and of debt-to-revenue
ratios are expected to rise until 2023 and start declining thereafter (Figure 3 and Table 1a).
17.
Alternative scenarios and bound tests indicate that all debt sustainability
indicators remain broadly on stable paths and do not reveal particular vulnerabilities
(Table 2a). However, the bound test stressing growth at one standard deviation below its
historical average shows the most sensitive debt dynamics relative to the baseline. Also, in
the scenario of an unchanged primary balance from 2011, the PV of debt and the
debt-service-to-revenue ratios deviate substantially from the baseline providing support for
the envisaged fiscal adjustment over the medium term.
18.
Cameroon continues to strengthen its debt management framework, though
more efforts are required going forward. Following joint Bank-Fund technical assistance,
the authorities are working to implement a new debt management strategy aligned with
CEMAC guidelines. Since 2009, a quarterly report is published on the country’s debt
situation. The authorities have started producing a DSA and have formulated a medium-term
debt management strategy for central government debt, which has been annexed to the 2011
13

The 2010 DSA had a drop of 8.2 percent, corresponding to the average growth rate of exports in 2000-09
minus 1 standard deviation below the 10 year historical average.
14

A new issuance of bonds for CFAF 150 billion and of Treasury bills for CFAF 50 billion has been budgeted
for 2011. The macroeconomic framework underlying the DSA retained one-third of the amount for the bond
issuance as prospects for issuing the total are still uncertain.

11
budget law. The National Debt Committee instituted in 2008 is now in place, although not
yet operational. The last partial audit of domestic arrears was conducted in 2010. The
authorities are also working on a reform plan that would strengthen the country’s debt
management capacity by improving the information system, cash management, and human
resources. As next steps, the government would need to ensure that the mandate given the
National Debt Committee, and the reform plan, are effectively implemented.
V. CONCLUSION
19.
Cameroon’s risk of debt distress remains low, but there are signs of some
greater vulnerability, compared to the 2010 DSA. All debt ratios remain below the
policy-dependent thresholds in the baseline. However, ongoing and projected new domestic
and external borrowings will push debt indicators to levels higher than in the 2010 DSA.
Debt indicators rise under alternative scenarios and bound tests; and in the extreme case of an
export shock, external debt indicators slightly breach the country-specific debt burden
threshold during 2020–25. In all other cases, debt indicators remain at a comfortable level.
Moreover, while some uncertainty exists regarding the amounts and the terms, the quite rapid
pace of accumulation of nonconcessional borrowing commitments in 2010–11 is a source of
concern, as is the large stock of unsettled payment obligations. The associated risk needs to
be managed carefully, including through an annual DSA exercise.
20.
The authorities broadly shared the risk assessment, while pointing to the
scarcity of concessional financing available to realize the projects which are aimed at
removing key infrastructure deficiencies. The authorities see the current debt
vulnerability level as providing some space for a reasonable increase in debt-financed
investment and they are cognizant of the need to finance infrastructure projects with
concessional financing to the extent possible. Thus, they envisage moderate use of
nonconcessional borrowing for projects where concessional financing may not be available.
21.
However, persistent weakness in public financial management and insufficient
data coverage suggest caution in assessing Cameroon’s debt vulnerabilities. These
vulnerabilities include quasi-fiscal liabilities of state-owned enterprises and recurrent
build-up of domestic arrears. The authorities’ efforts to improve debt management could be
reinforced by steps to ensure better coverage of public sector liabilities and by a new and
more comprehensive audit of domestic unsettled payment obligations. Staffs remain of the
view that continued efforts to improve nonoil revenue mobilization and to widen the export
base would be advisable, given the expected long-run decline in oil revenues.

2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

The MDRI provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries that qualified for the
assistance. Grant assistance from the MDRI Trust and HIPC resources provide debt relief to
cover the full stock of debt owed to the Fund as of end-2004 that remains outstanding at the
time the member qualifies for such debt relief.

_________________
Decision point - point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country
qualifies for assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of assistance to be
committed.
Interim assistance - amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and
completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance committed at
the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional circumstances).

Completion point - point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its
assistance committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of
interest income as defined in footnote 2 above. The timing of the completion point is

4
linked to the implementation of pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating
completion point).
IX.

Safeguards Assessments:

The Bank of the Central African States (BEAC) is the regional central bank of the Central
African States. The most recent safeguards assessment of the BEAC was completed on
July 6, 2009. The findings of this assessment indicated that implementation of previous
safeguards recommendations on financial reporting, internal audit, and internal control was
limited, and that the changing risk profile of BEAC foreign exchange holdings required
further actions to strengthen safeguards at BEAC. Subsequent to revelation of Paris office
fraud, a series of measures and longer term safeguard measures were agreed between the
IMF and BEAC in order to continue with country programs. Consequently, BEAC adopted
an action plan for 2010 with the aims of reforming its governance and strengthening key
safeguards. Implementation of the action plan is ongoing, and BEAC is adopting additional
measures to address the weaknesses highlighted by the special audit on headquarters
operations.
X.

Exchange Arrangements:

Cameroon participates in a currency union with five other members of the CEMAC and has
no separate legal tender. Cameroon’s currency, the CFA franc, is pegged to the euro at the
fixed rate of CFAF 655.957 per euro. Local currency equivalent: CFAF 735.39=SDR 1, as of
May 26, 2011. Effective January 1, 2007, the exchange arrangement of the CEMAC
countries has been reclassified to the category of conventional pegged arrangement from the
category of exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is
based on the behavior of the common currency, whereas the previous classification was
based on the lack of a separate legal tender. The new classification thus reflects only a
definitional change, and is not based on a judgment that there has been a substantive change
in the exchange regime or other policies of the currency union or its members.
Cameroon maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions, except for restrictions maintained for security
reasons that have been notified to the Fund pursuant to Executive Board decision
144-152/51.

The last Article IV consultation with Cameroon was concluded by the Executive Board on
July 14, 2010.
An Article IV consultation mission visited Cameroon during March 16-31, 2011.

mission that visited Cameroon as part of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) in
June 2007, itself building upon the Central African Economic and Monetary Community
(CEMAC) regional FSAP that was conducted in 2006.
The first Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) on fiscal transparency
and transparency of monetary and financial policies for Cameroon was issued in June 2000.

Strategy: The new Country Assistance Strategy will aim at improving governance and accelerating growth. The World
Bank will help to stimulate growth by improving the competitiveness through (i) increased infrastructure investment in
the energy, transport, and telecommunications sectors; (ii) activities geared toward ensuring the transparent, equitable,
and sustainable use of natural resources; and (iii) promotion of high potential value chains and improved business
climate. It will also focus on service delivery with a particular emphasis on (i) human development (education, health);
(ii) social protection, to help develop an effective safety net system based on targeted programs; and (iii) local
development, where the focus will be on increasing access to basic services through infrastructure upgrading and
capacity building for improved local governance.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 30, 2011

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation
with Cameroon
On June 24, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Cameroon.1
Background
Cameroon preserved macroeconomic stability conditions, and debt relief under HIPC
and MDRI firmed up debt sustainability. However, there has been no growth in per
capita income in the past five years, despite the productive base being relatively
diversified. Growth has been constrained by underinvestment in critical infrastructure, an
unfavorable business climate, poor public financial management, a shallow financial
sector, and weak regional trade integration.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in Summings
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
The country remains dependent on commodities for export earnings and fiscal revenues
and is thus vulnerable to external shocks, as seen during the recent global financial
crisis.
The economy continues to recover from the impact of the global crisis, and inflation
remains low. Real GDP growth in 2010 is estimated at 3.2 percent, up from 2 percent in
2009, despite a drop of about 12 percent in oil output. Average annual inflation was
contained at 1.3 percent, compared with 3 percent in 2009. Food price inflation was
1.2 percent in 2010, and the recent sharp increase in international commodity prices has
so far had a limited impact. The external accounts have benefited from the global
economic recovery. The current account deficit (including grants) declined to 2.8 percent
of GDP, from 3.8 percent in 2009.
The fiscal accounts show a limited overall budget deficit in 2010. Total revenue was
close to the supplementary budget target, because the oil revenue windfall generated by
the recent oil price surge compensated for a shortfall in nonoil revenue. Nonetheless
nonoil government revenue, as a ratio to nonoil GDP, remains among the lowest of subSaharan African oil exporters. Some efforts were made in 2010 in terms of arrears
clearance to deal with the legacy of PFM problems incurred
in 2009.
In terms of the composition of spending, current expenditure was higher than budgeted,
while delays in issuing government bonds and mobilizing external financing negatively
affected capital expenditure. The deficit on a cash basis, after accounting for the
clearing of outstanding government obligations accumulated in previous years, was
relatively modest (2.3 percent of GDP). The banking sector, however, continues to have
pockets of vulnerability.
Economic growth is expected to pick up gradually under current policies. Real GDP
growth in 2011 is projected at 3.8 percent and is expected to gradually increase to
5 percent in 2014. The positive outlook is conditional on the expected recovery of the
global economy, the execution of infrastructure expenditure, and ongoing initiatives to
improve the business climate. Inflation is projected to remain below the regional
convergence criterion of 3 percent.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Cameroon’s economic recovery, low inflation, and
positive economic prospects. At the same time, Directors noted risks from a slower
global recovery, lower-than-projected oil production, and budgetary pressures. Important
challenges remain in improving fiscal management, promoting a sound banking sector,
and raising competitiveness and long-term growth.

3
Directors emphasized the need to address the risks to the 2011 budget through tight
treasury management, reduction of fuel subsidies, and spending reprioritization. They
encouraged further efforts to improve non-oil revenue by broadening the tax base,
streamlining exemptions, and increasing the efficiency of tax and customs
administration.
Directors expressed concern over the recurrence of systemic problems in public
financial management as reflected in spending overruns on goods and services and
large-scale accumulation of payment obligations. They welcomed the ongoing audit of
outstanding arrears and encouraged the authorities to implement the planned measures
to prevent new arrears. Directors also emphasized the need to rebuild fiscal buffers,
strengthen the budget execution process, and accelerate efforts to operationalize the
medium-term expenditure framework.
Directors welcomed that Cameroon’s risk of debt distress remains low, but noted the
recent surge in nonconcessional borrowing to finance infrastructure projects. They
encouraged the authorities to rely, to the extent possible, on grants and concessional
loans to finance their investment program. They stressed the importance of working
closely with regional institutions in developing a government securities market, which
can reduce vulnerability to external financing shocks and, over time, lead to a more
competitive financial system.
Directors noted with concern the banking sector vulnerabilities, which have been
exacerbated by inadequate supervisory standards and protracted delays in settling
government payment obligations. They encouraged the authorities to take resolute
steps, in collaboration with the regional bank supervisor, to monitor vulnerabilities
through regular analysis of banking sector soundness, press ahead with bank
restructuring plans while containing budgetary liabilities, and promote the reform of the
bank resolution framework.
Directors underscored the importance of redoubling efforts to address the severe
infrastructure gap and improve the business climate and competitiveness. They saw the
need to raise the execution rate of public investment projects, deepen the dialogue with
the private sector, and improve public institutions and governance. Directors
encouraged the authorities to improve the quality and timeliness of economic and
financial data required for surveillance.

Statement by Kossi Assimaidou Executive Director for Cameroon
June 24, 2011
I-Introduction
I would like to thank staff and management for the constructive discussions held in Douala
and Yaoundé with my Cameroonian authorities under the 2011 Article IV consultations. My
authorities broadly share the thrust of the staff report, which underscores the key challenges
facing the country in achieving higher and sustainable economic growth, reducing poverty
and enhancing Cameroon’s competitiveness.
The implementation of prudent macroeconomic policies has led the Cameroonian economy
to gradually recover from the recent global crisis. The authorities are determined to step up
their efforts with a view to significantly increasing economic growth in per capita terms,
reducing the economy’s vulnerability to shocks, and deepening regional integration. In this
respect, they remain committed to pursuing the implementation of their economic program
through further improvement in the fiscal situation and reforms focused on safeguarding the
stability of the financial system, preserving public debt sustainability and boosting the
competitiveness of the economy. In their efforts, the authorities are hopeful that they will
continue to benefit from policy advice and support from the Fund and the international
community.
II-Recent Economic Developments
Despite the fall of oil production and uncertainty surrounding the global recovery, economic
growth is estimated to have reached 3.2 percent in 2010 against 2.0 percent in 2009. This
encouraging performance is mainly attributed to growth in the non-oil sectors, notably the
agriculture and forestry activities. Due in particular to the substantial decrease in food prices,
average annual inflation was contained at 1.3 percent compared with 3 percent a year earlier.
On the fiscal side, domestic revenue mobilization reached the supplementary budget
objective while current expenditure was higher than budgeted. In this context, the fiscal
deficit on cash basis stood at 2.3 percent of GDP, well below the 3.5 percent of GDP targeted
in the supplementary budget. In addition, substantial efforts were made in 2010 to clear the
outstanding government obligations accumulated in previous years. This step was part of the
authorities’ efforts to deal with public finance management problems incurred in 2009 and
their determination to rein in spending. It is also important to note that in November 2010 the
authorities issued for the first time on the national and regional market a government bond
whose proceeds will finance public infrastructure projects.
To address the vulnerabilities stemming from the weak financial condition of some domestic
banks, the authorities in close collaboration with regional institutions are committed to
review the regulatory framework and strengthen the supervision of financial institutions.

2
III. Policies and Reforms in 2011
Fiscal and Debt Policies
The authorities' efforts will be strengthened in 2011 to further improve the public finance
management and preserve debt sustainability. To this end, ongoing reforms in the fiscal area
will be aimed at increasing revenue mobilization, and containing non-priority spending. The
2011 budget projects nonoil revenue to reach 14.1 percent of nonoil GDP mainly supported
by new administrative and tax policy measures. Expenditure will be maintained at 2010
levels with a large increase in capital spending compensated by cuts in outlays for goods and
services. The overall budget deficit is projected at 2.6 percent of GDP, which will be
financed through a combination of drawings from government deposits and issuance of
government bonds.
Although the 2011 budget is benefiting from the increase in world oil prices, the authorities
are facing considerable fiscal pressures, notably arrears to the domestic oil refinery, fuel
subsidies, contingent claims from the restructuring of distressed banks, and uncertainties
regarding the capacity of the market to absorb the second bond issuance. To address these
issues, the authorities will pursue the reassessment of the fuel price formula and reduce
subsidies to retail fuel prices by gradually restoring the automatic adjustment of retail fuel
prices to world prices over the medium-term. They will also implement a tight treasury
management plan to avoid new domestic arrears. In addition, the authorities have undertaken
an exhaustive audit of arrears and other government payments obligations. Efforts to further
improve cash management, improve expenditure efficiency will be further pursued. In this
regard, my authorities will implement—with the support of donors—the modernization of
public expenditure.
On the revenue side, my authorities are determined to accelerate the implementation of
ongoing fiscal reforms with a view to widen the tax base. The tax administration reform,
including measures to simplify tax and customs procedures and rationalize tax incentives
schemes is a key priority as such reform will help raise Cameroon's nonoil revenue.
My authorities welcome the debt sustainability analysis prepared by staff. They share the
view on the need to maintain a prudent borrowing policy. In this respect, their efforts will be
geared towards widening the exports base and rely to the extent possible on grants and highly
concessional loans for the financing of public investments. Furthermore, they intend to work
closely with regional institutions in developing a regional market for government securities
and therefore reduce vulnerabilities to external financing shocks.
Financial Issues
The Cameroonian authorities are determined to develop a vibrant financial sector and
improve access to finance. To this end, efforts to finalize the restructuring of financially
weak banks will be pursued notably with (i) the recovery of loans granted to borrowers
related to main shareholders, and (ii) banks' recapitalization through reputable investors.

3
The authorities will push further, under the regional currency cooperation, for reviewing the
regulatory framework and strengthening the supervision of financial institutions. In
particular, the CEMAC institutions will be involved in strengthening the regional
supervisor's capacity and improving regulations and rules governing mechanisms for the
treatment of banks in difficulty.
As regards access to credit, encouraging progress has been made in improving the regulatory
framework. Not only a central credit registry has been established and is operational but also
a law on leasing was enacted in December 2010 to help the SMEs have access to credit. The
authorities intend also to establish specialized financial institutions to finance agricultural
and SME activities. The development of these activities will help reduce youth
unemployment. The management of such specialized financial institutions will be based on
market rules with appropriate safeguards put in place.
Competitiveness and Structural Reforms
Improving the competitiveness of the Cameroonian economy remains a key priority of the
authorities. In this regard, they agree on the necessity to improve the business environment in
the context of the economic and monetary union. Their efforts will continue to focus on
removing the non-price factors that hamper the business environment, fighting corruption
and reforming public enterprises.
With the support of the IFC, the authorities established in 2009 the Cameroon Business
Forum as a platform for dialogue with the private sector. Under this Forum, measures to
simplify regulations and procedures for starting a business, enhance cross border trading,
promote access to, and protection of, property have been successfully implemented.
The authorities are also addressing the infrastructure needs of the country and the insufficient
provision of public services. They are intensifying their efforts under the CEMAC
framework to further liberalize customs duties and accelerate regional trade liberalization.
IV. Conclusion
Macroeconomic stability continues to be preserved while the recovery of the Cameroon
economy is underway. The authorities are determined to consolidate this recovery and intend
to speed up their reform efforts towards better fiscal management, greater competitiveness,
stronger growth and poverty reduction. In these endeavors, they will seek the support of the
international community, including the Fund, with a view to formulating and implementing
the needed policies and reforms.
