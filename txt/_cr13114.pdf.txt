STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 17, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context: Despite global financial uncertainty, Estonia’s strong macroeconomic policies
and the economy’s Nordic ties have underpinned the economic recovery, which has also
been supported by euro adoption. With exports booming, output growth has exceeded
the euro area average since 2010. Price pressures have eased in line with global fuel and
food prices, but Estonia’s inflation remains among the highest in the euro area. In the
near term, growth is likely to slow and downside risks stem primarily from a prolonged
period of slow euro area growth. Financial spillovers could also increase should the euro
area crisis re-intensify.
Fiscal policy: Estonia’s public finances remain strong notwithstanding a small deficit in
2012. Still, strictly adhering to budgetary allocations can avoid untimely stimulus in 2013.
Should downside risks materialize however, automatic stabilizers should be allowed to
operate while maintaining fiscal credibility. Establishing a full-fledged medium-term
budgetary framework with multiyear expenditure ceilings can help prioritize expenditure
and avoid pro-cyclical policies.
Financial sector policy: The banking sector has remained profitable, liquid, and well
capitalized, and its funding has improved. Risks remain, but are mitigated by
strengthening balance sheets and prudential positions. Further strengthening macroprudential policies and enhancing long-standing cross-border supervision and
prudential arrangements would help safeguard financial stability. The EU banking union
can provide an additional avenue for these efforts.
Long-run growth: Beyond safeguarding Estonia’s competitiveness and business
friendly environment, there is an urgent need to ensure that those searching for a job
possess the skills demanded by employers and to curb long-term joblessness. In this
regard, continued focus on enhancing training and higher education is essential.

CONTEXT
1.

Estonia’s recovery has endured with tensions easing gradually. Steadfast

implementation of strong macroeconomic policies, the economy’s Nordic ties, and euro adoption
have provided a strong footing for the economy. Estonia’s sharp economic contraction, following a
collapse of its housing market and the global financial crisis, has been left behind with exports
thriving; these now substantially exceed their pre-crisis levels. Employment in export-related
activities has supported the needed reorientation of resources to the tradable sector. Both overall
and long-term unemployment have declined but remain above pre-crisis levels. Household balance
sheets have improved but remain weak relative to corporate balance sheets (Figure 1). More
recently, domestic demand has also strengthened, particularly investment, while inflation has
declined due to waning external price pressures.
2.
Estonia’s growth returned to a sustainable pace in 2012 (Figure 2). Growth has exceeded
the euro area average since 2010 despite considerable headwinds; Estonia has been among the top
performers in the EU. Initially, exports—particularly those tied to the Nordic production chain—had
been the main driver of the recovery with double-digit increases for a number of quarters since
2010. More recently however, tightening capacity constrains and declining inventories have boosted
private investment, which has increased by more than 50 percent in the last two years. And private
consumption has been supported by rising consumer confidence and positive labor market
developments. Employment continued to grow in 2012 with a net increase of about 10,000 jobs or
roughly 1.5 percent of the labor force.

Inflation eased to about 4 percent in 2012, but remained among the highest in the
euro area (Figure 3). External price pressures (associated with global fuel and food prices) weakened
and contributed to lower headline inflation in 2012 (Box 1). Despite rising real wages, core inflation
has also declined with weaker manufacturing goods prices more than offsetting increases in rental
prices reflecting rising housing prices. The labor market has remained strong and the adverse impact
of real wages increases on labor costs has been offset by productivity gains (Figure 4), except
recently in the manufacturing sector.

4.
Domestic credit has begun to increase. In the aftermath of the crisis and reflecting a
largely demand phenomenon, credit contracted by about 12 percent from its peak at end-2008. But
recent credit data suggest that deleveraging may have run its course in 2012 (Figure 5). A boost in
commercial and consumer lending contributed to raise credit growth (including leasing) to about
1½ percent year-on-year at end-2012. Developments in mortgage credit, which account for the bulk
of household credit have been less clear cut, but the stock of credit appears to have leveled off at
end–2012.
Box 1. Estonia: Inflation Trends
Estonia’s CPI inflation has been the highest in the euro area for a number of years. Its inflation
gap over the euro area peaked at about 8¼ percentage points at end-2008 but has since declined
sharply to about 1½ percentage points; since 2000 the accumulated gap has reached about
27 percent at end-2012. Core inflation has followed a similar pattern (with an accumulated gap of
about 18 percent since 2000) but declined more sharply, particularly since June 2012.
Should Estonia’s inflation developments be a source of concern? Economic theory points to a
number of potential factors that can explain inflation differentials in a monetary union. Higher
productivity in the tradable sector—catching up from a lower level relative to trading partners—and
rising income levels may be the main reasons. Such a Balassa-Samuelson effect may reflect increases
in the relative demand of nontraded versus traded goods. Less benignly, a real appreciation could
reflect weak domestic market competition, or an economy whose growth and cyclical position are
more advanced than that of the monetary union.
In Estonia, recent inflation appears to have primarily reflected global fuel and, to a lesser
extent, food price developments (Annex I). Moreover, commodity prices have had a larger and
more persistent inflationary effect in Estonia after the crisis. This is broadly consistent with its high
energy usage intensity. Regarding equilibrating real appreciation, this may have had a more
prominent role in explaining inflation earlier in the decade, but recent price increases in non-traded
goods sector (particularly services) have been smaller than those in the traded goods sector.

5.
Credit developments in 2012 reflected improving private sector balance sheets. On the
supply side, banks have been winding down the resolution of non-performing loans (NPLs), helping
to stabilize commercial real estate and, to a lesser extent, mortgage borrowing, which together
account for almost 60 percent of domestic credit. Improved banks’ balance sheets, strong domestic
deposit growth and the reduction of reserve requirements upon euro adoption have also eased
liquidity. On the demand side, private deleveraging has shown signs of winding down, with
household debt declining to about 86 percent of disposable income (roughly 15 percentage points
lower than its peak). At the same time, the real estate market has steadily recovered, with housing
prices up about 40 percent from their trough in late 2009, thus strengthening collateral value and
private wealth.

6.
The fiscal outturn was better than expected in 2012. A smaller fiscal deficit emerged with
tax revenues—notably income tax and indirect (VAT) taxes—bolstered by a strong economy, an
improving labor market, and continued revenue collection efforts. Also, a small under-execution of
public investment projects—mostly tied to CO2 emission unit sales from 2011—reduced overall
public spending. These factors more than offset the envisaged drivers of the budget deficit, namely
the restoration of pension pillar II contributions (previously diverted to the budget), and a small
increase in basic pensions. As a result, gross public debt remains the lowest in the EU (10 percent of
GDP), and fiscal buffers at about 10 percent of GDP constitute an adequate protection against
Estonia’s high economic and fiscal revenue volatility (Annex II).
7.
A small current account deficit has emerged in 2012, despite broadly unchanged
competitiveness. Besides a small deterioration in its terms of trade, the switch in the current
account balance to a deficit has mainly reflected the widening of the trade deficit to about
4¼ percent of GDP (Figure 6). Import volumes have far outpaced exports volumes reflecting resilient
domestic economic conditions, notably private investment. Still, the service balance has continued
to record a large surplus and net income payments to foreign investors remained sizable.
Competitiveness has remained roughly unchanged and the real exchange rate is broadly in line with
fundamentals (Box 2).
8.
Gross external debt has declined nonetheless. The capital and financial accounts posted
an atypical surplus as the drop in outflows—including Estonian subsidiaries paying back loans falling
due to their foreign parent banks—exceeded the decline in FDI inflows. This has reduced gross
external debt by roughly 6 percent of GDP to about 93 percent of GDP in 2012. The external DSA
suggests that external debt dynamics remain sustainable in plausible risk scenarios.

OUTLOOK
9.
Growth will likely slow in 2013, line with less buoyant domestic demand and weaker
external demand. Real GDP growth is projected to be about 3 percent in 2013. Exports will
continue to provide a positive, albeit smaller, contribution to growth conditional on a euro area
recovery in the second half of 2013. Private consumption is projected to expand in line with
continuing improvements in the labor market, also sustained by cuts in the unemployment
contribution rates. But private investment’s contribution to growth is projected to decline consistent
with a slowing from its double-digit growth in 2011–12.
10.
Despite one-off domestic factors, inflation is projected to decline in 2013. External price
pressures will continue to wane and more than offset the effects of Estonia’s energy market
liberalization on January 1 and of increases in excise taxes on alcohol and tobacco. Core inflation
nonetheless is projected to remain roughly unchanged with productivity gains continuing to broadly
offset wage increases, notably increases in public sector wages and the minimum wage.

Box 2. Estonia: Competitiveness Developments
Standard methods for evaluating real exchange rate misalignment suggest that Estonia’s real
exchange rate has remained broadly in line with fundamentals. Current account-based methods
suggest an undervaluation, while a direct assessment of the equilibrium real exchange rate suggests
an overvaluation. Taken together, these results point to a small overvaluation (about 2½ percent) or a
slight worsening of price competitiveness compared to the assessment in the 2011 Article IV
Consultation. But the magnitude of overvaluation continues to fall within the bounds of the
measurement error.

Price- and cost-based indicators support a stable trend in competitiveness (Figure 7). After
declining in 2009–10, the various ULC-deflated measures of REER have remained unchanged in 2011–
12. Real wage growth has been accompanied by productivity gains that have offset adverse labor cost
effects. Still, the CPI-based REER for overall economy remains about 5 percent higher than its precrisis level.
Exports continue to perform well. Despite difficult economic conditions in euro area trading
partners, the strong export rebound continued in 2012. As a result, the ratio of exports to GDP
reached 92 ½ percent, the second highest in the Baltic nations and Central Europe. In addition,
Estonia’s shares in key export markets, such as Sweden and Russia, increased steadily in 2012.

11.
Risks to the outlook for 2013 will largely be on the downside (Annex III). These stem
primarily from a prolonged period of slow growth in the euro area and the potential indirect effects
on key Estonian export markets. Financial market volatility in Europe has moderated largely
reflecting policy developments in Europe—notably the establishment of the European Stability
Mechanism (ESM) and the program of Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) as well as troika
programs in distressed countries. These developments have reduced the likelihood of extreme tail
events but, with little evidence of a turnaround in the euro area, the projected pickup in external
demand remains to be confirmed. Delays in the euro area recovery can slow Estonia’s exports
(two-thirds of which are to the EU), reduce job creation and thereby limit household’s ability to
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

service their loans. The unwinding of past real and financial sector imbalances would thus be more
protracted and weigh on domestic demand. Moreover, in the event of a sharp resurgence of global
financial market volatility, financial risks could spillover from Swedish parent banks should they
come under pressure. Alternatively, a faster-than-expected euro area recovery or unexpected export
resilience could boost growth. In this case, continued labor market strength could fuel wage and
price pressures.
12.
While broadly agreeing with the outlook, the authorities expressed concern about
developments in the euro area. They noted that work was underway to revise their official
projections that will be available in April. Still, the authorities expected growth to remain around
3 percent in 2013 with weaker export markets.1 In this regard, they stressed that Estonia was better
able to cope with adverse external shocks as macroeconomic imbalances have declined. Regarding
inflation, they expected price increases to slow as the impact of external price shocks moderates. But
tight labor markets would exacerbate wage pressures, particularly in the medium term, should
economic activity accelerate with productivity gains struggling to keep pace. They recognized that
Estonia’s inflation is higher than in its neighbors and efforts continue to assess underlying factors,
including the economy’s high energy intensity.

POLICY CHALLENGES
13.
Against this backdrop, this year’s Article IV consultation with Estonia focused on
policies to underpin its hard-earned fiscal and financial stability as well as how best to
safeguard competitiveness to support sustainable growth and employment. The authorities’
policies have been in line with Fund advice (Box 3). Together with its successful euro adoption, these
policies have contributed to reduce Estonia’s domestic and external imbalances and vulnerabilities.
To build on these achievements, three broad areas require continued attention: fiscal stability,
financial sector robustness, and broadening sustainable growth
Box 3. Implications of Fund Advice
Relations between Estonia and the Fund have remained excellent. Policies have been characterized by a
high degree of ownership—a key factor in its economic success—and these have been broadly
consistent with Executive Board recommendations. But large increases in current spending resulted in
an ill-timed loosening of the fiscal stance in the boom years. Since then, corrective actions, including
expenditure reversals and increased indirect taxation, have been in line with Fund advice. Most of the
key recommendations of the 2009 FSSA update have been adopted, including a domestic bank
resolution framework to facilitate rapid bank restructuring. Consistent with Fund advice, the authorities
have recently cut unemployment contribution rates and have been discussing enhancements to their
medium-term fiscal framework to further entrench their strong fiscal position.
1

After the mission returned, the authorities updated their macroeconomic projections in early April. For 2013, they
maintained real GDP growth and headline inflation respectively at 3 percent and 3½ percent and lowered slightly the
projected fiscal deficit by about ¼ percent of GDP to ½ of 1 percent of GDP.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

A. Enshrining Fiscal Stability
14.
Estonia’s long-standing track record of fiscal prudence underpins fiscal sustainability
(Figure 8). Besides resulting in the lowest public debt in the EU, Estonia’s cautious fiscal policy has
also supported the authorities’ efforts to build fiscal buffers. These were called upon at the height of
the global financial crisis and provided a secure source of financing. This flexibility proved vital in
dealing with the crisis and limited the need for contractionary pro-cyclical policy.
15.
Notwithstanding Estonia’s record, the 2013 budget foresees a small deficit. The budget
cuts total expenditures by about 1 percent of GDP. Still, the budget accommodates increases in
social spending—notably old-age pensions, mean-tested child allowances, unemployment benefits,
and a 5½ percent increase in the public wage bill (following a 3-year freeze). This amounts to an
increase of about ¼ percent of GDP and raises the share of social spending in the budget to about
37¾ percent (an increase of about 3 percentage points). The budget also envisages an increase in
public investment (about 1¾ percent of GDP), mostly associated with projects tied to EU structural
funds. Spending increases are to be partially offset by cuts in other current spending. The overall tax
burden is envisaged to remain broadly unchanged as cuts in the unemployment insurance
contributions are offset by increases in excise taxes (tobacco and alcohol) and in pollution and
navigation fees. These tax changes should nonetheless help household balance sheets. Public debt
will increase by about 1 percent of GDP reflecting Estonia’s contribution to the European Financial
Stability Fund, an increase in the public power company’s capital, and recourse to European
Investment Bank loans to co-finance EU-related projects.
16.
The fiscal stance will likely be broadly neutral and appropriate given cyclical
conditions. Staff estimates that the cyclically adjusted fiscal balance will remain roughly unchanged.
Taking into account the carry-over effects of the economy’s strong second half of 2012, staff
projects that total revenues will exceed the budget by about 1¼ percent of GDP, compared to
unchanged revenues in the budget. These additional revenues would more than offset the budgeted
spending increases and result in a small surplus of about ½ of 1 percent of GDP in 2013. The surplus
could be slightly higher should capital spending (not associated with EU structural funds) be less
than budgeted. With the recovery enduring, sticking to the budget’s allocations would be
appropriate and windfall revenues should be saved as in the past. If however, the aforementioned
downside risks materialize, automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate while maintaining
fiscal credibility.
17.
With the authorities’ medium term target (a small surplus) in sight, Estonia faces the
challenge of safeguarding this achievement while addressing medium-term needs. In the
medium-term, continuing strong revenue collections are projected to result in small surpluses.
Anchoring fiscal policy on a small surplus can ensure low and sustainable debt as well as keep fiscal
buffers at above 9 percent of GDP. The latter will protect Estonia’s ability to cope with economic
volatility and downside risks. Moreover, Estonia’s enviable fiscal position provides room to be
mindful of public investment needed to underpin long-term growth potential and reduce the tax

burden, as well as to continue efforts in addressing structural labor market issues. This scenario will
nonetheless require unwavering efforts to control current expenditure while safeguarding and
gradually increasing social spending and redirecting spending to infrastructure.

policy tradeoffs and avoid pro-cyclical

Box 4. Estonia and the Fiscal Compact
In 2012, the EU adopted a Fiscal Compact (FC) and the economic governance Two-Pack. The FC is
a pan-European law requiring member countries to incorporate into their national legislation a fiscal
rule on the structural budget balance and the related enforcement mechanisms, a requirement for an
annual debt reduction, as well as a limitation on the growth of primary expenditure.

To better align national budgetary decisions with the obligations under the Stability and
Growth Pact (SGP) and the FC, the Two-Pack legislation aims to improve economic
governance by:





strengthening the rules of the SGP with stronger and tighter surveillance, including at an early
stage;
introducing new controls on macroeconomic imbalances;
establishing standards to ensure the correct and independent compilation of statistics; and
increasing transparency in the decision-making processes and accountability of decision-makers.

The FC requires that Estonia’s structural fiscal deficit not exceed 1 percent of GDP and
public debt remain under 60 percent of GDP. It also reinforces the SGP with an expenditure
rule requiring primary expenditure growth not to exceed that of potential GDP. Given Estonia’s
strong public finances these are not binding, but it will need to implement a formal medium-term
budgetary framework by 2014, including an expenditure rule allowing automatic stabilizers to operate.

19.
The authorities highlighted that the 2013 budget adheres to the goals set out in
Estonia’s budget strategy, and thus protects economic stability and growth. They expressed
their continued commitment to strong fiscal policy—essential to maintain macroeconomic
stability—while underscoring the budget’s spending increases in social areas. Likewise, the
authorities noted that their budgetary position had provided room for a modest increase in the
public wage bill following a 3-year freeze. They also noted the need to continue improving Estonia’s
energy efficiency, with CO2-related investment devoted to the construction of efficient power plants
as well as energy efficiency-enhancing insulation in government and private buildings. More
broadly, general government investment will remain high, with nearly half of it supported by
external sources, and will focus on road maintenance, economizing water usage, and enhancing the
hospital network infrastructure. Regarding automatic stabilizers, these would be allowed to operate
but they would consider expenditure and revenues measures if a downturn threatens their EU
commitments.
20.
Regarding medium-term fiscal policy, the authorities underscored that they would
continue to aim for balance or better. This would be measured in structural terms despite the
inherent difficulties of assessing the output gap, all the more uncertain in the context of Estonia’s
small open economy. Also, they stressed that their target is tighter than required by the EU to
ensure that fiscal buffers are rebuilt and thus enhance the economy’s ability to cope with downside
risks. The authorities concurred that a fully-fledged medium-term fiscal framework could provide a
useful tool to assess policy trade-offs and avoid pro-cyclical policies. In this context, the authorities
noted that, to comply with EU requirements, they will reform the Financial Management Act
accordingly; it should be with Parliament later in 2013. While discussions continue, these reforms
would incorporate their medium-term target and spell out how deviations will be addressed. The
authorities also noted that a draft legislation regarding the establishment of an FC is under
preparation and will be submitted to Parliament in 2013. In line with the EU requirements, the
council will be endowed with functional autonomy, have an advisory role on budgetary and fiscal
matters, and undertake regular assessments of fiscal performance. While the composition of the
council is being discussed, they expected that it would begin more like a working group and evolve
as experienced is gained. Finally, the authorities stressed their goal, as budgetary conditions allow,
to cut labor taxes, increase the tax exempt income threshold, reduce the personal income tax rate in
2015, and continue increasing revenue collection efficiency.

with the improving economy and asset quality have
boosted profits and helped replenish banks’ capital in 2012. The capital adequacy ratio has risen to
about 19½ percent in January 2013, far exceeding current international norms. Meanwhile, bank
funding has also improved with a declining share of foreign funding and rapidly growing domestic
deposits, which has resulted in a record low loan-to-deposit ratio.
22.
Risks to the financial sector remain but are mitigated by strengthening balance sheets.
On the domestic side, the main source of risk stems from (flexible rate) mortgage loans—typically
tied to the six-month Euribor—of which about 18 percent currently have negative equity. On the
external side, Estonian subsidiaries receive significant funding from Swedish parent-banks which in
turn rely on potentially volatile short-term wholesale markets, and are exposed to risks stemming
from elevated household debt and house price-to-income ratio.2 These risks appear manageable
nonetheless. At present markets expect stable interest rates, allaying interest rate risks that could
diminish households’ ability to service their loans. Also, in Estonia, lower private debt, improving real
estate prices, higher employment, and low interest rates have strengthened the ability of the private
sector to service its debt. On the external side, parent-banks appear to be sound and the Swedish
housing market has been gradually cooling. Moreover, parent funding of Estonian subsidiaries has
been stable reflecting a strategic commitment to, and highly profitable investments in Estonia.3
Finally, Estonia’s financial exposure to EU distressed countries is limited.
23.
Recent stress tests suggest that banks are reasonably well positioned to cope with
risks. In an adverse scenario seeking to replicate the 2008 events, the Eesti Pank’s (Estonia’s central
bank) bottom-up stress tests from Fall 2012 show that NPLs would rise significantly and peak at
6.5 percent at end-2013. However, the required increase in provisioning could be absorbed by bank
profits. In addition, banks have substantial prudential buffers (tier 1 capital is about 13½ percent) as
2

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA

well as access to the ECB’s liquidity facilities. Capital adequacy would remain well above statutory
minimums.4 These test results hinge however on unchanged foreign funding (notably, parent banks
maintaining their Estonian exposure) as well as on the presumption that profits are not repatriated
to parent banks. These assumptions are consistent with the experience following the global financial
crisis.
24.
Strengthening Estonia’s macro-prudential policies would help reduce risks further. The
EU’s CRD IV capital and liquidity requirements have been designed to enhance financial stability in
an increasingly challenging EU environment. Although the EU directive allows gradual adjustment,
early adoption of these requirements—in tandem with parent banks—would enhance Estonia’s
financial sector’s standing without unduly constraining banks’ margins or credit growth. This is
because banks already broadly meet these requirements. Similarly, in view of the prevalence of
short-term variable interest rate-linked mortgages, adopting formal caps on loan-to-value and loanto-income ratios—consistent with Estonia’s current banking sector practices—can cement stability
and reduce risk exposure. Also, Eesti Pank’s macro-prudential authority and existing tri-lateral (Eesti
Pank, MoF, and FSA) forums can be further clarified and strengthened—in line with the European
Systemic Risk Board’s recommendations—to enhance the monitoring of systemic risks and limit
potential fallout.
25.
Looking forward, deeper cross-border prudential arrangements would help underpin
financial stability in Estonia. Over a number of years, Estonia and other Baltic nations have,
together with their Nordic counterparts, developed an effective regional supervision framework
supported by cooperation agreements and the establishment of the Nordic-Baltic Stability Group
and Macroprudential Forum. Their ongoing work has appropriately focused on establishing a
burden-sharing mechanism, a common database for financial groups, and preparing for crossborder simulation exercises. In conjunction with EU-level initiatives, these efforts should move ahead
by implementing key elements of the framework, notably defining criteria for burden sharing.
The EU banking union can further enhance Estonia’s financial stability (Box 5). The banking
union can bolster financial soundness throughout the EU, including by introducing uniform
prudential oversight standards and burden sharing mechanisms to respond to financial shocks.5 In
this regard, the single supervisory mechanism (SSM) will place Estonia’s two largest banks under the
direct supervision of the ECB. Additional efforts are, however, needed to clarify the role and powers
of the Estonian authorities in this context, including in supervisory colleges and with regard to the
exchange of confidential information.

Box 5. Europe’s Banking Union
In September 2012, the European Commission unveiled an ambitious roadmap toward a banking
union proposing a single supervisory mechanism (SSM), harmonized national resolution regimes
for credit institutions and standards across national deposit insurance schemes. The SSM should be
operational by 2014 and draft Directives for bank resolution and deposit insurance schemes adopted by
mid-2013. Under the SSM, certain supervisory tasks would be transferred to the ECB and a supervisory
board (comprised of representatives from all participating countries) would be established to act in the
interest of the European Union. It is envisioned in particular that the ECB would exercise direct supervision
over those institutions that are considered significant and the national authorities would supervise other
institutions. In consultation with the ECB, either can adjust macro-prudential policies, including capital
requirements when deemed necessary. A mediation panel would be created to help resolve
disagreements between the ECB and national authorities. Non-euro countries can opt to enter into close
cooperation agreements with the ECB and thereby become participating members of the SSM together
with euro countries, with similar representation in the supervisory board. In contrast to euro area
members, they can decide not to implement the board’s decisions but this would end their participation in
the board.
Finally, the EC’s proposals have confirmed the EBA’s powers to build a common legal framework
for bank regulation and a common supervisory culture across the European Union. For purposes of
the application of the single rule book, voting arrangements within EBA are to be adapted so that
decision-making structures continue to be balanced between the positions of members of the SSM and
those of the other EU countries.

26.
This will nonetheless entail coordinating Estonia’s long-standing arrangements with
the Nordic authorities and the EU banking union. The option to join the banking union, changes
proposed in the voting rights at the EBA, and other measures to ensure an EU-wide approach to
financial stability in the banking union, have helped assuage non-euro area countries’ misgivings
about the SSM. Still, as the SSM and other elements of the banking union go forward, it is essential
not to disrupt existing home-host prudential arrangements and safeguard supervisory coordination.
This will entail spelling out a common agreement for bank resolution and burden sharing for
financial groups—including for those groups spanning the euro and non-euro area jurisdictions—
with a view of minimizing the risk of an abrupt contraction in the exposure in host countries.
27.
Financial stability can also be supported by further efforts to improve bankruptcy
procedures. With the adoption of the reorganization act for household restructuring in April 2011,
continued efforts are needed to limit bankruptcy losses and enhance asset recovery by facilitating
out-of-court debt restructuring, reducing the cost and ensuring the timely application for, and
prompt resolution of bankruptcy procedures.
28.
The authorities emphasized their commitment to maintain a strong financial system in
the face of an evolving financial architecture. They agreed that enhancing current macroprudential policies as advised by staff would strengthen Estonia’s financial system. The authorities
confirmed that these policies should not pose undue burden on banks or on credit to the economy.
But they stressed that under the SSM, their implementation would require coordination with the

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA

ECB. In this regard, the authorities explained that once CRD IV was finalized, they would reform the
Credit Institution Act to clarify the central bank’s role in setting macro measures and further
tri-partite collaboration. Regarding bankruptcy reforms, they stressed that it was early to assess the
new household restructuring law but planned to increase resources available to bankruptcy courts
29.
In welcoming the EU banking union, the authorities underscored the importance of
preserving the Nordic-Baltic working arrangements. In this regard, they highlighted the need to
continue clarifying the role of these arrangements within the banking union and avoid disrupting
long-standing close collaboration with their Nordic colleagues.

C. Broadening Estonia’s Sustainable Growth
30.
While safeguarding competitiveness, further improvements in Estonia’s business
friendly environment are needed to secure the economy’s attractiveness for FDI. Estonia’s
geographical location makes it a natural trading partner for Nordic countries. As a result, strong ties
with Nordic economies have developed as part of their manufacturing supply chains, with Estonia’s
cost-effectiveness continuing to attract FDI from the region. But income convergence with the EU
will require Estonia to move up the export-value chain. The challenge will be to increasingly
transform Estonia into a knowledge-based economy. Beyond continued reorientation of resources
to tradable sectors, building human capital will prove essential. In this regard, the authorities have
focused on building R&D capacity, improving training in technical fields, and enhancing
infrastructure (supported by EU funds)
31.
In addition, Estonia faces the challenge of fully employing its resources. Estonia’s
recovery has seen employment rebound but the recovery has also revealed long-standing structural
problems in the labor market. While the

demanded by employers, introduce flexibility
in voucher training programs, and improve the recently established IT platform can also support the
needed reorientation of the economy. While continuing to assess the effectiveness of these
programs and striving for continued efficiency gains, they may need to revisit labor market policies
as Estonia’s spending ranks among the lowest in region.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA

32.
The authorities underscored their commitment to address labor market tensions and
boost long-run growth. While unemployment has declined it remains high, with growing vacancies
pointing to a shortage of skilled workers. They noted that while outward migration could have
contributed to this shortage, most migrants have not been skilled workers. The authorities
concurred with the need to continue focusing on making training plans more flexible and providing
additional opportunities to accumulate human capital. Specifically, they pointed to plans to
unbundle professional certifications allowing workers to divide the training needed for full
certification, while achieving intermediate certifications over time. The unbundling would thus
require less time away from work and improve earnings prospects while in training. The authorities
also concurred with the need to develop human capital in technical fields, including by enhancing
cooperation efforts among the relevant institutions to complement the collaboration of universities
and technical schools with the private sector. The importance of these initiatives has been
highlighted in Estonia’s 2020 Competitiveness Strategy, and they stressed that improving life-long
learning at all skill levels will be needed to foster continued productivity growth, maintain external
competitiveness and sustain income convergence.

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
Estonia has succeeded in reducing its macroeconomic imbalances and vulnerabilities,
but faces the challenge of preserving its hard-earned fiscal and financial stability and
enhancing long-term growth prospects. Supported by its Nordic links and prudent policies,
Estonia’s recovery has taken hold in 2012. Risks to the outlook are largely on the downside and stem
primarily from a prolonged period of slow growth in the euro area. Financial spillovers could emerge
in the event of a sharp resurgence of global financial market volatility. Alternatively, faster-thanexpected euro area recovery or unexpected export resilience could boost growth and fuel wage and
price pressures in the medium term.
34.
Estonia’s fiscal position is strong, but strenuous efforts will be needed to resist calls on
the public purse and avoid untimely fiscal stimulus in 2013. Staff welcomes the budget’s
increase in social spending and investment and cuts in the unemployment insurance contribution
rates, which could support household balance sheets. Moreover, the budget’s fiscal stance is
appropriate given cyclical conditions. In this regard, there will be a need to withstand spending
pressures in the context of incipient real wage pressure and adhere to budgetary allocations and
save potential windfall revenues to avert procyclical fiscal policy. If downside risks materialize,
automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate while maintaining fiscal credibility.
35.
With the authorities’ medium target at hand, Estonia faces the challenge of
safeguarding this achievement and addressing medium-term needs. With unwavering efforts to
control current spending—including continued public wage bill restraint—and redirect spending to
public investment, projected revenues could result in small fiscal surpluses in the medium term. This
would keep public debt low and sustainable, and preserve adequate buffers to cope with economic

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA

volatility and downside risks. But there will be a need, as budgetary conditions allow, to make room
to address Estonia’s medium-term economic challenges, including lowering the tax burden.
36.
In this regard, adopting a fully fledged medium-term fiscal framework can help assess
policy tradeoffs and avoid pro-cyclical policies. Regardless of the specific rules and institutional
setup, the fiscal framework should be transparent and simple to support fiscal credibility and
accountability. Multi-year expenditure ceilings should be an integral part of the framework to reduce
policy uncertainty and enhance fiscal discipline. Also, its implementation would avert pro-cyclical
fiscal policies while maintaining fiscal credibility.
37.
Financial sector stability can be safeguarded by strengthening macro-prudential
policies. Notwithstanding the banks’ strength, risks can be further reduced by early implementation
of forthcoming international standards. Specifically, and in tandem with parent supervisors, timely
adoption of the capital and liquidity provisions of the CRD IV would enhance Estonia’s financial
sector resilience. This would not unduly constrain banks’ margins or credit to the economy since
Estonian banks already meet or exceed the likely requirements. The authorities should also consider
introducing ceilings on loan-to-value and loan-to-income ratios to reduce exposure to housing
market developments and downside risks. Regarding the institutional structure, the central bank’s
macro-prudential authority and existing tri-party forums can be further strengthened to advance the
monitoring of systemic risks and limit potential fallout.
38.
Deeper Nordic-Baltic cross-border prudential arrangements and the EU banking union
can further enhance Estonia’s financial stability. The long-standing close Nordic-Baltic
cross-border supervisory collaboration has underpinned Estonia’s financial stability. In this regard,
ongoing work to spell out cross-border burden-sharing mechanisms and establish a common
data-exchange platform for financial groups should continue in tandem with EU-level initiatives. The
EU banking union can further bolster financial soundness in Estonia and progress has been made in
establishing the SSM, which will place two of Estonia’s largest banks under the direct supervision of
the ECB. In this regard, further work is needed to clarify the role and powers of the Estonian
authorities. As the banking union goes forward, particular efforts should be made to avoid
disruptions in existing Nordic-Baltic supervisory arrangements.
39.
Estonia needs to safeguard its external competitiveness, address skill mismatches, and
accelerate human capital accumulation. Increasing employment in export-related activities has
supported the reallocation of resources to the tradable sector and sharply reduced unemployment.
But the latter remains high and further reductions are hindered by skill mismatches and long-term
structural unemployment. In addition, while the economy has remained broadly competitive, Estonia
faces increasing competition from low-cost producers. As highlighted in “Estonia’s 2020
Competitiveness Strategy,” knowledge-based activities will hold the key to move up the export value
chain. In this regard, the authorities’ ongoing efforts to foster coordination among the relevant
institutions and reform training and education programs are welcome. Continued attention to these

areas would support human capital development, bolster productivity, and increase long-term
growth prospects.
40.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Annex I. Estonia: Inflation1
1.
Estonia’s inflation has been higher that in the euro area for a number of years. During
the boom years, inflation developments reflected growing macroeconomic imbalances and
contributed to competitive losses.2 More recently, the economy has been adjusting and, while
remaining high compared to the euro area, inflation has eased and productivity gains have
supported competitiveness.

Inflation in a Monetary Union
2.
In principle, a number of factors may underlie inflation in a monetary union. A simple
framework—taken from the open macroeconomics literature3—can help to understand Estonia’s
inflation developments. Consider the following expression decomposing a country’s inflation
differential with monetary union into tradable and non-tradable goods inflation:
(1)
where , ,
stand for headline inflation, tradable and non-tradable goods inflation respectively,
and represents the share of non-tradable goods in the consumption basket; an asterisk denotes
the euro area counterparts and inflation is measured as year-on-year log differences.4 The inflation
differential thus reflects deviations from the law of one price in tradable goods (the first term on the
right) and/or differences in the relative inflation in non-tradable and tradable goods. The other two
terms can capture the Balassa-Samuelson (B-S) effect: as Estonia tradable goods sector’s
productivity catches-up with the euro area, its higher relative productivity (versus non-tradable
goods) sector pushes up economy-wide real wages, resulting in higher non-tradable inflation and
higher overall inflation.5

International Monetary Fund Country Reports consistently discussed the impact of the boom years on inflation and
competitiveness, including IMF Country Report No. 10/4.

4

This expression does not fully capture inflation associated with price level convergence. To the extent that price and
income are related, price convergence can arise in economies whose incomes are below the average of the monetary
union. Nor is the model equipped to identify non-tradable goods inflation associated with an economy running
ahead of the monetary union’s business cycle.
5

In this framework, the response of inflation in tradable goods in Estonia to tradable goods inflation in the euro area
provides a simple way to think about competition in domestic markets. Strong competition (including
contestable markets) should limit this response to at most one. Weak competition would allow tradable goods
inflation to exceed that in the euro area (once trade price levels have converged). This avenue however is not
explored here due to data limitations. Anecdotal data point to specific instances of outlying prices increases but
limited product market regulations (compared to EU countries) in the OECD’s 2008 assessment would suggest that
markets have been free to operate.

3.
An economy’s preference for services (non-tradable) can also impact its inflation
differential. Typically, as a country becomes richer a larger share of its consumption will fall on
(non-tradable) services, that is, will tend to increase. Formally, this would correspond to nonhomothetic preferences giving rise to an expansion curve that bends toward non-tradable goods.
Thus, as technology advances the real exchange rate appreciates due to consumer preferences. The
effect on the inflation differential can be approximated by taking the partial derivative of equation 1
with respect to :
1

(1’)

Equation 1’ captures the effect of an increase in non-tradable goods in the consumption basket on
the inflation differential.6 Note that the inflation differential increases to the extent that non-tradable
good inflation exceeds that of tradable goods, as well as when inflation in tradable goods and
non-tradable goods (weighted by their consumption shares) rise.
4.
Likewise, inflation can reflect asymmetric responses to tradable goods shocks across a
monetary union. These responses can proxy for shocks in commodity prices and in terms of
:
equation 1 can be expressed by taking the partial derivative with respect to

where the impact on inflation differential will depend on the response of Estonia’s tradable and nontradable goods inflations as well as on the share of non-tradable goods in the consumption basket.
1),
Note that the impact on the inflation differential can be zero if the law of one price holds (
and the impact on inflation in non-tradable goods as well as the consumption baskets are the same
in Estonia and the euro area.

Suggestive Empirical Evidence for Estonia
Balassa-Samuelson
5.
Stylized facts suggest that B-S could explain inflation in the Baltic countries (Figure 1).7
Between 2000 and 2011, productivity increases in the tradable sector have been of the range of 170
to 250 percent in the Baltic countries, compared to about 25 percent in the euro area. Also, real
wages in both tradable and non-tradable goods sectors have in general experienced
commeasurable increases in the Baltic countries. In Estonia and Latvia, wages experienced rapid
6

In rigor, equation 1’ is an approximation. This is because it takes the standard model (derived with homothetic
preferences) and then assumes that prices are a function of preferences. The proper way to proceed would have
been to start with a model that assumes non-homothetic preferences and derive the price equations in that context.
These models however typically have non-tractable solutions.

7

Productivity is calculated by dividing real sector output by total employment in the tradable goods sector. The real
wage is gross wage bill deflated by HICP index, and divided by total employment. The tradable sector includes
agriculture, forestry, fishing, and industry (manufacturing and mining), while the non-tradable sector includes
construction and all services. All data are taken from Eurostat.

growth during the boom (2005–07), particularly in the non-tradable goods sector (e.g. construction).
But since then, wages growth has declined to levels supported by productivity growth. On the other
hand, wage growth in non-tradable goods sector in Lithuania and the euro area has been relatively
restrained, especially after crisis.

6.
But the difference in productivity underlying the Balassa-Samuelson effect suggests
otherwise. The relative differential in non-tradable and tradable productivity between Estonia and
the euro area is small and unlikely to fuel the (overall) inflation differential. Starting from a standard
two-sector small open economy model with Cobb-Douglas production functions and perfect labor
mobility across sectors8 (see Rabanal, 2009, and Mihaljek and Klau, 2008), non-tradable goods
inflation relative to tradable goods inflation can be expressed in terms of relative productivity:

Also, tradable versus non-tradable inflation differentials point away from the BalassaSamuelson effect in Estonia, particularly after the crisis (Figure 2). The difference between
services and goods price inflation in Estonia has recently been negative, albeit becoming less so.9
This would thus put downward pressure on (overall) inflation differential. (There is some
contribution from the euro area’s sectoral inflation differential but it is likely to be small.) Weighting
by the share of non-tradable goods consumption shows a similar picture. Thus, while non-tradable
inflation may have contributed to the inflation differential during the boom, it is less likely to have as
large an effect more recently.

Non-tradable goods bias in consumption
8.
Even though Estonia’s income has more than doubled in the past decade, the share of
non-tradable (services) goods in consumption has barely increased (Figure 3). Consistent with
the lack of price pressures in the non-tradable goods sector, there is scant evidence supporting that
non-homothetic preferences underlie Estonia’s inflation differential with the euro area.10 Moreover,
the share of services in total consumption is lower than what would be predicted from its relative
income level in 2010.

Asymmetric response to commodity price shocks
9.
An asymmetric response to global commodity prices shocks has characterized
Estonia’s inflation. The correlation between global commodity prices and the difference between
Estonia’s tradable price inflation and that of the euro area is high (Figure 4). 11 Episodes of large
commodity price booms tend to coincide to a large extent with increases in tradable goods prices in
Estonia relative to the rest of euro area, albeit with a lag.

10.
Moreover, the asymmetry appears to have become more pronounced after the crisis.
Staff and Eesti Pank have previously discussed how Estonia inflation response tends to be larger
than that of the Baltic countries, which in turn far exceeds that of the euro area (see IMF Country
Report No. 11/34). The evidence discussed below confirms previous findings but points to larger
and more persistent inflationary effect in Estonia from global commodity prices shocks in the more
recent period.
The empirical model and detailed results
11.
Reduced-form VAR models have been used to examine the relative impact of global
food and fuel price shocks on Estonia. Specifically, these models have included three variables of
interest: commodity prices, nominal effective exchange rate (NEER), and headline (HICP) prices. A
second four-variable model—splitting prices into tradable and non-trade goods prices—has also
been considered to examine the sectoral impact of global price shocks. Logged indexes spanning
11

The monthly HWWI Euro area EUR Commodity Price Index is used here.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

41

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA

January 2000 to December 2012 were used to estimate models for Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and the
euro area. For consistency and cross-model comparability, all models have included two lags in
accordance to the Akaike Information Criteria. Global shocks were placed first in the Cholesky
ordering, with the exchange rate and prices placed last; the four-variable model places tradable
goods prices next to last and non-tradable goods prices last. The responses depicted below show
the impact of a standard one-error shock.
12.

The results for Estonia’s inflation can be summarized as follows:



A commodity price shock (about 6 percent on impact and dissipating within three months)
results in inflation rising by about ¾ of 0.1 percent on impact, peaking in a month, and slowly
returning to zero.12 The cumulative impact is about ½ of 1 percent in six months (Figure 5).



A shock to the NEER does not appear to have much of a pass-through effect before two months
have gone by (Figure 5).



A commodity price shock has a more persistent impact on inflation after the crisis. While the
magnitude of shocks (not shown) is similar before and after the crisis, a commodity price shock
in the 2008–12 period produces a mildly stronger but much more persistent response of
headline inflation: it takes almost a year (compared to three months in the early period) to
dissipate (Figure 6).



The pass-through effect from the NEER exchange has diminished post-crisis (Figure 6).



Not surprisingly, tradable goods inflation responds more to exchange rate and commodity price
shocks than non-tradable goods inflation (Figure 7). This result can reflect the relative energy
intensiveness and imported inputs needed for the production of tradable goods (notably
manufactured products) compared to non-tradable goods.

13.
In addition, Estonia’s inflation remains more sensitive to commodity shocks than the
inflation in other Baltic countries. Despite facing a similar shock, headline inflation in Lithuania is
less sensitive and its response dissipates more quickly than Estonia (Figure 8). In Latvia, headline
inflation responds modestly (not much different from zero). Of note, Estonia and the euro area have
broadly similar inflation responses in the first couple of months (a bit higher in Estonia), but inflation
persists longer in Estonia.
14.
Estonia’s inflation might reflect its intense use of energy. Specifically, primary energy
intensity (0.24 koe/$05p) is twice as high as EU average and substantially higher than in the other
Baltic countries. Of note, the energy intensity in agricultural production is particularly high
(0.27 compared to 0.09 EU average), and has increased significantly since the crisis.

12

The average (monthly) shock to commodity prices during 2010–11 has been in the order of 32 percent.

Annex II. Estonia: Economic Volatility1
1.
Smaller economies typical face higher volatility. This can reflect a small country’s narrow
production base limiting its ability to diversify risks and cope with idiosyncratic shocks. For practical
purposes, an economy’s size can be thought to be an exogenous factor that can be correlated with
other factors associated with volatility, notably openness.
2.
While historically Estonia’s output volatility does not appear to be high for its size, its
volatility has risen sharply since the crisis. The increase in volatility could mirror the intensity of
Estonia’s downturn and thus volatility may dissipate as the recovery takes hold. At this stage
however it is difficult to assess whether the crisis will have lasting effect.

LTU

4

Growth rate

Openness. Often noted as potential increasing
volatility is exposure to international trade.
Compared to a closed economy, international
trade introduces a constellation of trade shocks
that can buffet an economy. These can interact
with domestic shocks to reinforce economic
volatility. But greater openness can also provide
integration to more stable markets, diversifying
economic risks and possibly reducing volatility.

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA



Government size. A larger public sector might be better able to cope with shocks than smaller
(credit constrained) households and firms. In principle, transitory shocks might be more readily
financed by the public sector, thus contributing to smooth adjustment. In practice nonetheless,
it is difficult to assess the permanence of a shock in real time. Shocks requiring adjustment (as
opposed to financing) can be misinterpreted and a larger government can thus prove to be a
hindrance. Likewise, a larger government will require higher taxes to be sustainable, which in
turn can reduce long-run growth2 and ultimately possibly undermining sustainability.



Income per capita. As a country develops, its production base typically expands to less volatile
activities3. Specifically, the relative importance of the primary sector (agricultural) diminishes,
with the secondary (manufacturing) and tertiary (services) sectors accounting for a large share of
value added. Besides the intrinsic lower volatility of these sectors, the greater diversification can
further reduce volatility.

4.
Estonia’s volatility stands out from Europe in a number of dimensions. While Estonia’s
openness is similar to that of Belarus, Ireland, and Slovakia, its output volatility is at least twice that
experienced in these countries (column 3, Figure 1). Likewise, Estonia’s employment and, to a lesser
extent, fiscal revenues volatility are also higher. Moreover with the exception of fiscal revenues,
these differences appear to have increased more recently. Consistent with other Baltic countries,
Estonia’s public sector is smaller than the European average and experiences above average output
and employment volatilities (column 2, Figure 1). Of note, fiscal revenue volatility appears in line
with its European partners and has declined more recently. Looking at the relation between Estonia’s
volatility and per capita GDP suggests that output and employment volatility are high but revenue
volatility is about as expected (column 1, Figure 1).
5.
Still, not all of these differences withstand simple empirical analysis. Cross-section
regressions for the 17 euro area countries (using ordinary least squares), suggest that openness, size
of government, and per capita income can explain a substantial share of the volatility of output,
employment, and fiscal revenues (R2 exceeds 0.5). But given the sample size, these regressions are
hard-pressed to apportion the impact of these individual factors: individual t-tests are not
consistently statistically significant despite the fact that the F-tests are (multi-colinearity). At best,
the results are suggestive of favorable impact of government size on the volatility of employment
and fiscal revenues. Controlling for country size (land area or population) does not qualitatively
change the results but does improve the regressions’ ability to explain volatility.
6.
More robust empirical evidence does not fully support simple stylized facts. The
available evidence on the openness-volatility relationship is mixed. Industry-level data suggests that

trade openness increases volatility.4 In particular, sectors more open to international trade are more
volatile and less correlated with the rest of the economy. Moreover, trade is accompanied by
increased specialization, contributing to enhance aggregate volatility. But trade openness can in fact
reduce volatility for countries with relatively diversified export baskets.5

could precipitate a collapse in oil
supply, resulting in sharp increases
in global oil prices.

Given Estonia’s relatively high
energy intensity, an oil shock
would have adverse effects on
inflation and output.

Annex IV. Labor Market Developments: Skill
Mismatches and Unemployment1
1.
Estonia’s unemployment spiked in the wake of the global financial crisis but
has since declined markedly. From early 2008, Estonia’s unemployment increased
fourfold to about 20 percent in 2010. For their part, other Baltic countries have also
endured far sharp increases in unemployment. But as economic growth resumed, the
unemployment rate in the Baltic nations have declined sharply. Notwithstanding Estonia’s
more pronounced declines compared to other Baltic countries, its unemployment rate
has remained high and above historical averages.
2.
Cross-border workers and emigration may have contributed to reduce
Estonia’s unemployment. The geographic proximity and cultural ties with Nordic
countries, Finland in particular, has contributed to cross-border work and emigration. The
number of port passengers between

crisis—increased markedly. In fact between 2009 and 2010, Estonians working in Finland
increased by about 12,000 (or roughly 250 percent)2 bringing Finland’s share of those
working abroad to 70 percent (25 percentage points increase) of all Estonian working
abroad. More often than not, Estonians working abroad appear to have been employed
in construction markets abroad. More recently, emigration to advanced EU countries
have increased possibly reflecting job opportunities abroad in business service, IT, and
professional and scientific sectors, notably medical doctors and nurses. These sectors
have had greater job vacancy rates abroad than in Estonia; Estonians working abroad in
the tertiary sector have experienced an increase of almost 70 (y-o-y) in 2012. Of note,
emigration to Sweden and Russia has remained broadly stable.

reduce unemployment indirectly through emigration. Labor force survey suggests
that skilled Estonian workers have emigrated to Finland and, to less extent, to some of
the advanced EU countries—benefiting from the low unemployment in relevant jobs
abroad and in search of higher paying job, particularly as employment opportunities
were significantly curtailed during the Estonia’s downturn. Still, while migration of highly
educated individuals experienced an increase of almost 40 percent in 2012, these
represent only about a quarter of Estonians working abroad.

But as Estonia’s unemployment has eased, labor market shortcomings have
come to the fore. Specifically,



Skill mismatches have worsened. As expected, recent declines in unemployment have
been accompanied with declining vacancy rates. But this pattern (known as the
Beveridge curve) appears to have changed in early 2010, so that now at the same rate
of unemployment higher vacancies emerge even though both declined in the fourth
quarter of 2012. Also, vacancies have become particularly prominent in
communication and information sector. Empirical evidence from OLS and panel
regressions (based on data from 2008–12) suggests an upward shift after 2010 for
Estonia and Lithuania (to a lesser extent, Latvia). Recent changes in unemployment
benefits could have contributed to the shift in Estonia where these have increased,
but these benefits were reduced in Lithuania in 2009.

In addition, differences across the Baltic countries could reflect idiosyncratic
unemployment responses to economic activity. Consider the standard Okun’s law
specification (Owyang and Sekhposyan, 2012):

time respectively. In this equation, is the elasticity of the unemployment rate to the output
gap, and captures the long-run unemployment rate (loosely the “natural” rate) that prevails
when the output gap is zero.
The differences among Baltic countries center on the long-run rate of
7.
unemployment (Table 1). Specifically, estimation results from panel regressions (with fixed
effects and using quarterly data since the first quarter of 1995) suggest that Estonia’s long-run
unemployment is about 10 percent, with Latvia’s and Lithuania’s long-run unemployment
estimates at about 13 percent and 12 percent respectively. Moreover, the crisis appears to have
increased these long-run rates by about 3 percentage points throughout the region. The
elasticity of the unemployment rate to the output gap is estimated to be about -½ in Estonia
and Latvia, with Lithuania’s unemployment estimated to be a bit more sensitive to the output
gap. Of note, the crisis did not appear to have impacted the sensitivity of unemployment to the
output gap

The long-run rate of unemployment also varies across Estonia’s regions (Table 2).3
Specifically, estimation results from panel regressions (with fixed effects and using quarterly data
since the first quarter of 2000) suggest that Tallinn’s long-run unemployment is about 9 percent,

but for the Estonia’s West region it is about 1 percentage point lower, while in the Northeast it is
about 7½ percentage points higher. The estimates also point to a generalized increase of about
3 percentage points in the long-run unemployment after the crisis. The elasticity of
unemployment to the output gap is estimated to be roughly -½, with the elasticity closer to -¼
in Estonia’s West region. The latter may reflect the seasonal nature of work in this region and the
likelihood that the labor market adjustment could be changes in hours worked as opposed to
outright dismissal. In any case, the crisis does not appear to have impacted the elasticity of
unemployment to the output gap in Estonia.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
General: Estonia’s data provision to the Fund is generally adequate for surveillance purposes. A May
2001 data ROSC mission found that the quality of macroeconomic statistics was generally good. The
2009 fiscal transparency ROSC indicated that Estonia now meets nearly all of the requirements of
the transparency code, and approached best international practice in some areas. Estonia subscribed
to the SDDS on September 30, 1998, with metadata posted on the DSSB on January 27, 1999, and
met SDDS specifications on March 30, 2000. The latest (2010) annual observance report for Estonia
for the SDDS was posted on the Fund’s website in May 2011.
(http://dsbb.imf.org/images/pdfs/AnnualReports/2010/EST_SDDS_AR2010.pdf )
(SDDS webpage for EST) http://dsbb.imf.org/Pages/SDDS/CtyCtgList.aspx?ctycode=EST
National Accounts: The national accounts are compiled by Statistics Estonia (SE) in accordance with
the guidelines of the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA 95). Quarterly GDP estimates at
current and at constant prices are compiled using the production, income and expenditure
approaches and statistical discrepancies among them have at times been sizable. The annual and
the quarterly national accounts are compiled at previous year prices and chain-linked to 2005. As of
September 2011, data are compiled on the basis of the new version of classification of activities
EMTAK 2008, and using double deflation. Data were revised at this time back through 2002, with
earlier revisions to be subsequently introduced.
Public Finance: Fiscal data are published by the Ministry of Finance (MoF), while historical data are
also available on Statistics Estonia’s website. Monthly central government data are disseminated
with a lag of up to 25 days after the end of the month. Quarterly data on foreign loans and
guarantees by the central government are published in Estonian with a monthly lag. The Ministry is
using one of its two allowed SDDS flexibility options on the timeliness of monthly central
government operations data, and disseminate these data on the National Summary Data page.
Comprehensive annual data on central and general government operations (accrual basis) are
reported in the GFS Yearbook. These data include a statement of operations and the government
balance sheet, including data on financial assets and liabilities, both domestic and foreign. Quarterly
data for the general government are included in the International Finance Statistics.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: The Bank of Estonia (BoE) compiles and reports monetary and
financial statistics consistent with the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. Aggregate
financial data are compiled by the BoE and reported on a monthly basis. The majority of statistics
are disseminated on the Bank of Estonia’s webpage on the 17th banking day after the end of the
reporting period. Data for individual banks are also available on a quarterly basis since 2008Q1 on
the Financial Supervision Authority’s webpage. Estonia also regularly provides requested Financial
Soundness Indicators.

External Sector: Quarterly balance of payments, external debt, and international investment
position (IIP) data are compiled by the BoE consistent with the Balance of Payments Manual fifth
edition (BMP5). Daily exchange rate data are available with a one working day lag. Monthly
import/export data are available with a two month lag. The Data Template on International Reserves
and Foreign Currency Liquidity is disseminated monthly according to the operational guidelines and
is hyperlinked to the Fund’s DSBB.
Dissemination of Statistics: The Estonian authorities disseminate a range of economic statistics,
with a significant amount of data are available on the Internet:
 metadata for data categories defined by the Special Data Dissemination Standard are posted on
the IMF’s DSBB (http://dsbb.imf.org);


the Bank of Estonia website (http://www.eestipank.info/frontpage/en/)provides data on
monetary statistics, balance of payments, IIP, external debt and other main economic indicators;



the Statistics Estonia website (http://www.stat.ee/en) provides information on economic and
social development indicators;



the Ministry of Finance homepage (http://www.fin.ee/?lang=ee) includes information on the
government’s annual multi-year State Budget Strategy, as well as information and data on the
national budget, and government finance statistics (deficit, debt, financial assets).

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with
the Republic of Estonia
On May 3, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Estonia. 1
Background
In 2012, Estonia’s economic recovery continued with stronger-than-expected growth,
lower inflation and a close-to-balance fiscal outcome. Supported by strong
macroeconomic policies and Estonia’s Nordic ties, growth has returned to a sustainable
pace. Exports have substantially exceeded pre-crisis levels and have been the main
driver of the recovery while imports, bolstered by domestic demand, pushed the external
current account into a deficit. Tightening capacity constraints have prompted a strong
private investment response, and private consumption has been supported by rising
consumer confidence and a strengthening labor market. Inflation has declined in line
with global fuel and food prices, but it remains among the highest in the European Union
(EU). While overall and long-term unemployment rates have declined, these remain
above pre-crisis levels.
Growth will likely slow in 2013, in line with less buoyant domestic demand and weaker
external demand. With a gradual recovery in the euro area in the second half of 2013,
exports will provide a positive, albeit smaller, contribution to growth. Domestic demand
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings

is projected to expand in line with continued improvements in the labor market, and will
be bolstered by tax cuts. But private investment’s contribution to growth is projected to
decline consistent with a slowing from its double-digit pace in 2011–12. Inflation should
moderate as declining external price pressures are projected to more than offset the
effects of Estonia’s energy market liberalization and excise tax increases. Core inflation
is projected to remain unchanged with productivity gains broadly offsetting wage
increases.
Risks to the outlook will largely be on the downside in 2013. These stem primarily from a
prolonged period of slow growth in the euro area as the EU is the destination of twothirds of Estonia’s exports. The unwinding of past real and financial sector imbalances
will therefore be more protracted and weigh on domestic demand. Financial spillovers
could emerge in the event of a sharp resurgence of global financial market volatility.
Alternatively, a faster-than-expected euro area recovery or stronger-than-expected
exports could boost growth. In this case, continued labor market strength could fuel
wage and price pressures in the medium term.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for implementing strong policies that
have contributed to an impressive economic recovery, reduced imbalances, and
increased resilience to external shocks. Nevertheless, the economy faces downside
risks arising primarily from an uncertain external environment. Directors welcomed the
authorities’ commitment to sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms to
address the remaining vulnerabilities, safeguard macroeconomic and financial stability,
enhance growth prospects, and tackle the high unemployment.
Directors commended the authorities’ continued commitment to fiscal prudence. They
welcomed that the 2013 budget aims at rationalizing government expenditure, while
increasing social and investment spending. Going forward, it will be important to
withstand spending pressures on wages, adhere to budgetary allocations, and save
potential windfall revenues. Directors saw merit in adopting a simple and transparent
medium-term budgetary framework as it would provide fiscal credibility. In general, they
considered that multi-year expenditure ceilings under this framework would help reduce
policy uncertainty and avoid pro-cyclical policies. Setting up a Fiscal Council and a
structural budget balance rule would also enhance the framework.
Directors noted that the banking sector is profitable, liquid and well capitalized. They
agreed that further strengthening of macroprudential policies will be necessary to limit
banks’ exposure to the real estate market and safeguard financial stability. Directors
highlighted the importance of continued deepening of the existing cross-border NordicBaltic prudential arrangements. Looking ahead, they underscored the need for ensuring
coordination between the existing Nordic-Baltic arrangements and a future EU banking
union. Directors welcomed the ongoing initiatives to develop a data-exchange
cooperation framework among financial groups and to set up a cross-border burdensharing mechanism.

3
Directors emphasized that measures to reduce the high level of unemployment, build
human capital, improve the business environment, and boost competitiveness are
critical to foster long-run growth. Welcoming the recent steps to improve work incentives
and education systems, they called for stronger action toward addressing skill
mismatches, re-focusing education and training programs, including vocational training,
in order to meet the economy’s needs. They also called for improving labor market
flexibility.

Statement by Mr. Audun Groenn, Executive Director on Republic of Estonia
Mr. Martin Lindpere, Advisor to Executive Director
On behalf of the Estonian authorities we thank staff for the constructive and fruitful dialogues
and for the comprehensive Article IV report. The authorities share staff’s views on the key
issues that shape the outlook of the Estonian economy and also on the main policy challenges.
Economic Outlook
The Estonian economy has recently maintained growth at above the 3 percent level, which was
one of the highest growth rates in the European Union last year and exceeded the authorities’
expectations. The recovery of the Estonian economy from the 2008-09 recession has been
bolstered by credible and front-loaded adjustment measures that amounted to about 9 percent
of GDP in 2009. These measures helped to restore confidence, contributed to a reduction of
imbalances, and increased the resilience to adverse external developments. The Estonian
economy has benefitted from the fiscal policy set, consisting of a prudent budgetary position, a
low level of public debt, and fiscal reserves. The current low level of monetary policy interest
rates in the euro area has eased the balance sheet adjustment and supported domestic demand
in Estonia. Therefore, as the strong exports-led recovery has recently given ground, growth has
shifted more towards investments and consumption. Looking forward, the Estonian economy is
likely to retain steadfast growth, fastening in line with improvements in the external
environment. The risks lie predominantly in the external environment and may pass through
trade and financial channels.
Inflation has been affected by high commodity prices in the last years but is likely to slow in
2013. Core inflation has remained contained, standing at 2.1 percent in March 2013 and being
broadly consistent with a slightly negative output gap. However, the opening up of the
electricity market for consumers and SMEs and increases in tobacco and alcohol excise taxes
in January 2013 have all withheld a slowdown in headline inflation. According to the
authorities’ assessment, ca 1 percent out of 3.8 percent yearly harmonized consumer price
inflation in March 2013 can be ascribed to electricity and electricity related components. The
staff report claims that Estonian inflation might reflect its intense use of energy. The Estonian
primary energy intensity is indeed higher than in other Baltic countries and the European
Union. However, this reflects the fact that electricity is extracted from less energy efficient
oil-shale. Therefore, higher primary energy intensity does not necessarily refer to higher inflation
responsiveness to energy prices.
The staff report highlights the high sensitivity of Estonian inflation to commodity prices,
especially in recent years. Vigorous food exports are the essential element why food consumer
prices have strongly responded to food commodity price appreciation. The main destination
country has been Russia, but also Finland, Latvia, and Lithuania.
The Estonian labor market has undergone a vivid recovery with the unemployment rate
declining from 19.8 percent in the beginning of 2010 to 9.3 percent in the end of 2012. This
can be ascribed mainly to intensified domestic job creation, but to some extent also to working
abroad. Given the very low level of unionization and wage indexation, wage growth has been

2
predominantly productivity driven. According to the labor force survey, ca 1/5 of
approximately 25 thousand people from Estonia working abroad in 2012 were employed by
companies of Estonian origin. Estonia’s closeness to its Nordic neighbors allows for working
abroad but to retain residency in Estonia. This advantage is taken by people working mostly in
the secondary sector, construction in particular. However, labor force survey data, referred to
also in the staff report, is likely to understate true migration flows. Looking forward, the labor
market is likely to remain a source of domestic risk, as is identified also by staff. There are
signs of skill mismatches which together with potential migration outflows may add pressure
on wages and on core inflation in the medium term.
Fiscal Policy Issues
There is agreement between staff and the authorities on views about the Estonian fiscal sector.
The authorities have prioritized a conservative fiscal policy, with the aim that the general
government budget will be kept in a structural surplus and that a low level of government debt
is maintained.
Estonia’s structurally adjusted budget has been in surplus in recent years. In terms of the
unadjusted budget, surpluses of 0.2 and 1.2 percent of GDP were recorded in 2010-11. In 2012
the budget was in a 0.3 percent deficit, being still better than expected. The dynamics of the
budgetary position has recently been affected by the net position of the CO2 unit sales revenue
and the consequent investment spending. Last year this component contributed in the amount
of -1 of GDP as compared to 1 percent in 2011. In 2012, the general government debt was
10.1 percent of GDP, one fifth of which is related to the contributions to the European Financial
Stability Facility.
At the current juncture, the Estonian authorities see a heightened need to maintain fiscal
prudence. There are still fiscal and financial fragilities in the external environment and the
monetary policy stance is also accommodative. Therefore, the authorities consider a broadly
neutral fiscal policy stance as appropriate for the years to come. The latest macroeconomic
forecast of the Estonian Ministry of Finance from April 2013 predicts small fiscal deficits in
2013-14 and balance for 2015 while the IMF staff forecast foresees small surpluses. These
differences are not yet significant, being mostly on the revenue side. Following Estonia’s
medium term fiscal strategy for 2014-17, published last week, the authorities expect a fiscal
tightening and the structural surplus is expected to gradually reach 1 percent of GDP in 2016.
In the beginning of 2013, the unemployment insurance contribution rate was reduced by
1.2 percentage points to 3 percent, allowing household disposable income to increase. At the same
time, excise taxes on tobacco and alcohol were increased. The government previously
legislated a decline in the income tax rate by 1 percentage point to 20 percent, which will take
effect in 2015. Following the 2013 budget, the public sector wage bill is expected to increase
after a freeze in 2009-11 and a 4.4 percent increase in 2012. Capital expenditures as a share
of GDP will decrease in the coming years caused by the ending of the current EU financial
framework.

3
Estonia is in the process of setting up a Fiscal Council and a structural budget balance rule,
which are expected to enhance the current medium term fiscal framework. These initiatives are
yet in the form of draft acts with the expectation to be passed to the Estonian Parliament by
autumn this year and approved by the end of 2013.The fiscal rule is expected to impose
multi-annual ceilings on state budget expenditures. It prescribes an adjustment path towards
structural balance and the mechanism to compensate forecast errors on the deficit side.
Financial Policy Issues
The risks to financial stability stemming from the Estonian economy are low. There is broad
consensus between staff and the authorities that the Estonian financial sector has thrived out
from recession. The banks are well capitalized, with the capital adequacy ratio standing at
23.5 percent in December 2012 on consolidated basis, as well as being profitable and liquid. The
ratio of loans to deposits has reached 110 percent, the lowest level in a decade, and the ratio of
non-performing loans has returned to a level of almost 3 percent, as at the beginning of 2013.
The parent banks of the banks operating in Estonia, located in the Nordic countries, are sound
and internationally favorably positioned. Lending rates are low in Estonia and the loan
portfolio started to increase again last year, but without signs of excessive loan growth at the
near horizon. A viable recovery of profits in the non-financial corporate sector has allowed the
leverage ratio to return almost to the pre-boom level. The banks and borrowers have been
called by the authorities to remain aware of the future risks that accompany interest rate
increases.
The Estonian authorities see sovereign debt problems in the external environment and a
delayed recovery of global growth as the main threats to the domestic financial sector.
Therefore, steps towards establishing the SSM and imposing stricter capital and liquidity
requirements in 2014 are considered important. Given the highly integrated Estonian and
Nordic banking sectors, it is crucial that the current Nordic-Baltic cooperation on financial
stability will be preserved, even if the non-euro area countries should choose to opt out from
the SSM. The Estonian authorities welcome the steps of the Swedish authorities that placed
new liquidity requirements on their largest banks from the start of 2013.
The Estonian authorities plan amendments to the Credit Institution Act that will extend the
toolkit and executive power of the Bank of Estonia as the main macro-prudential authority. The
expectation is that these amendments will be made over the course of 2014 and will come into
force immediately thereafter. The implementation of macro-prudential tools is expected to
minimize systemic risks to financial stability and avoid a buildup of economic imbalances,
reducing business cycle volatility.
Structural Issues
One of the major concerns in the Estonian economy is the unemployment rate, which has fallen
substantially from the peak levels, but remains nevertheless above economically and socially
tolerable levels. The authorities have set an aim for the employment rate to reach 76 percent in
the productive age cohort of 20-64 by 2020 from the current 71.7 percent.

4
Long-term unemployment poses risks, especially against the background of skill mismatches
between the pool of unemployed and available vacancies. To alleviate these problems, the
Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund (EUIF) has updated and diversified their services
portfolio. New measures have become more individualized, and special services for disabled
persons and for people who have been out of work for a long time have been developed. The
EUIF has established more intense cooperation with municipalities and employers, addressing
better the community needs. Although the unemployment rate has fallen, the participation in
ALMPs has remained high or even increased (for example work related training, career
counseling, work practice, coaching for work life, debt counseling, psychological counseling,
and a few others). The EUIF has drawn a multi-year strategic plan for 2013-15 with predefined
effectiveness measures.
The Estonian authorities recognize the importance of developing human resources as a pillar of
long-term growth. There are yet many challenges to organize the educational system in a way
that creates mutually supportive relationships between human resources and economic growth
and alleviates pressures from population aging and migration. There are a number of ongoing
initiatives, which are aimed to make vocational training more available and competitive, taking
better into account the labor market needs. A set of indicators is agreed upon to measure the
success rate of these initiatives. Higher participation in lifelong learning has been one of the
policy priorities, increasing from 5.4 percent in 2002 to 12.9 percent in 2012. As a part of
higher education reform, the academic year of 2013-14 brings along a new financing model of
high education, making university studies free for all full-time students and providing
allowances, which are adjustable on the basis of family income.
