INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
REPUBLIC OF LATVIA
Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2006 Consultation with the Republic of Latvia
Approved by Alessandro Leipold and G. Russell Kincaid
September 13, 2006

The 2006 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Riga during May 24–June 6, 2006. The team
comprised Ms. van Elkan (head), and Messrs. Brunner, Gray (all EUR), and Prokopenko (MFD).
Mr. Kravalis (Senior Advisor, OED) participated in key meetings, while Mr. Tirpak (Regional
Representative office) joined for part of the mission. Mr. Saarenheimo (ED) and Mr. Rosenberg (Regional
Representative) attended the final meeting. The mission met with Finance Minister Spurdziņš, Bank of
Latvia (BoL) Governor Rimšēvičs, senior officials, academics, and representatives of financial institutions
and the business community.
Latvia acceded to the European Union (EU) on May 1, 2004 and entered ERM2 on May 2, 2005.
Parliamentary elections are scheduled for October 7, 2006. The four-party center-right coalition
government that took office at end-2004 was reduced to a three-party minority coalition in April 2006—an
interim arrangement that is widely seen as stable. Earlier this year, the Government indicated that it would
review its timetable for euro adoption (initially targeted for the beginning of 2008) on the basis of Latvia’s
macroeconomic performance; with no official announcement forthcoming, market participants generally
expect euro adoption in 2010 or later. Latvia currently meets all the quantitative Maastricht requirements,
with the exception of the inflation criterion, where it exceeds the allowable limit by about 3½ percentage
points as of mid-2006.
Latvia maintains security-related exchange restrictions pursuant to UN Security Council resolutions and
EC Council regulations, which have been notified to the Fund under Decision No. 144-(52/51), adopted
August 14, 1952.
Latvia has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard. Coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of
data are adequate for surveillance.
The authorities released the mission’s concluding statement (see link:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/ms/2006/060606a.htm), and have expressed their intention to publish the
staff report.

Executive Summary
Background: Financial deepening, EU-funded spending, and real wage growth caused a
surge in domestic demand that pushed the economy above capacity. GDP growth accelerated
to 10¼ percent in 2005, and the current account deficit and inflation remained elevated.
Foreign liabilities continued to build, while competitiveness weakened, banks’ exposure to
credit and market risks rose, and currency mismatches of households widened. High inflation
will thwart plans to adopt the euro in 2008; while a new target date has not yet been set,
market participants now expect euro adoption only in 2010 or later.
Outlook: Recent drivers of demand are expected to persist in the near term, and growth will
remain very strong, while the current account deficit will widen further and inflation will
remain in excess of the Maastricht limit. Thereafter, a gradual unwinding of imbalances
through a moderation of growth is likely, but with a more disruptive scenario also possible
were imbalances to remain unchecked.
Policy issues and discussions
An upfront policy tightening is needed to contain near-term overheating and secure a soft
landing. A sizable front-loaded fiscal adjustment, combined with more subdued wage and
credit growth, would help unwind the output gap, slow inflation, narrow the current account
deficit, and stabilize external liabilities. The ensuing reduction in external and financial
vulnerabilities would also increase the likelihood that a soft landing is realized.
Fiscal restraint is needed to counter the sizable demand stimulus already in play.
Achieving the needed fiscal withdrawal requires: (i) saving revenue overperformance in full
in 2006; (ii) sharply curtailing spending growth in 2007-08, including on projects in already
overheated sectors; and (iii) postponing the reduction in the personal income tax rate.
Moderating credit growth is essential to relieve overheating pressures. Monetary policy
should continue to lean against the wind by tracking changes in the euro policy rate.
However, policies that divert bank lending offshore or to less-regulated nonbanks, but
without slowing overall credit, should be avoided. More effectively taxing real estate would
restrain mortgage borrowing and ease pressures in the construction sector.
Risks from the credit boom and delayed euro adoption reinforce the need for a strong
regulatory and supervisory framework for banks. Open positions in euros should be treated
the same as any other foreign currency in setting prudential regulations, while Basel 2
introduction increases the imperative for close and effective cooperation with foreign
supervisors. More accurate financial data is needed on the household sector and stress tests
should simulate feedback channels between macroeconomic shocks and the banking sector.
Safeguarding competitiveness while narrowing the wage gap requires scaling the
technology ladder. Slowing domestic demand, improving productivity in the public sector
and further increasing labor force participation will help ease emerging labor shortages. But
to sustainably raise incomes while boosting exports, productivity gains underpinned by a
move up the value-added chain are needed.

this largely favorable background, substantial reliance on foreign savings over an extended
period caused net foreign liabilities to approach 60 percent of GDP in 2005, a level that is
unlikely to be sustainable over the medium term.

2.
Since 2004, the economy has been riding the wave of an integration-related
boom that has undermined Latvia’s record of macroeconomic stability and led to euro
adoption being put on hold. EU accession in mid-2004 and the prospect of imminent euro
adoption ushered in a rapid acceleration in economic activity and associated overheating
pressures. Deepening European integration brought lower nominal interest rates, large
disbursements of EU grants, substantial foreign inflows to domestic banks, and extensive
outward migration of labor. As a result, and notwithstanding Fund advice to address
macroeconomic policy shortcomings (Box 1), GDP growth increased to record levels, a
positive output gap emerged, inflation ratcheted up (including because of accession-related
convergence of food prices), current account deficits widened, credit growth accelerated, and
external debt increased (Figure 1, Table 1). Sustained inflation well in excess of the
Maastricht criterion has delayed the timetable for euro adoption (initially planned for the
beginning of 2008). In the absence of an official announcement of a revised planned entry
date, market participants generally expect euro adoption in 2010 or later.
Box 1. Response to Fund Advice
Latvia’s macroeconomic, financial and structural policies have generally been consistent with Fund
advice, particularly during the period covered by a series of stand-by arrangements, the most recent of
which expired at end-2002. More recently, however, when overheating pressures emerged and credit
growth accelerated, Fund policy advice had less resonance.
Fiscal policy: In recent years, the authorities have adhered less closely to the Fund’s fiscal policy
recommendations. Control over government spending has tended to ease toward year-end through the
introduction of supplementary budgets that have spent part of the overperformance of tax revenues. In
addition, differences in perceptions regarding macroeconomic conditions at the time of the 2005
consultation, as well as the receipt of sizable EU grants and spending pressures in advance of the
October 2006 elections, resulted in a significant loosening of fiscal policy, at odds with Fund advice
(PIN: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2005/pn05109.htm).
Monetary and exchange rate policy has been consistent with the narrow-band currency peg and
supportive of eventual adoption of the euro. In line with Fund advice, liquidity management shifted from
foreign-exchange swaps to open market operations, and an appropriate harmonization of reserve
requirements began already in 2000. In response to rapid credit growth, Latvian and euro-area reserve
requirement rates have diverged recently.
Financial sector: The 2001 FSAP assessed the supervisory framework as good and concluded that the
establishment of a unified supervisory agency proceeded smoothly. Since then, the authorities have
addressed many technical FSAP recommendations to further strengthen supervisory capacity. However,
in contrast to Fund advice, the minimum capital adequacy ratio (CAR) was lowered from 10 percent to
8 percent in late-2004, and limits on banks’ open positions in euros were lifted at the beginning of 2005.
A series of amendments aimed at eliminating previously-identified deficiencies in the AML/CFT
framework were adopted in 2005 and an AML ROSC was carried out in March 2006. An FSAP update is
planned for early 2007.

II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
3.
The economy is currently expanding at break-neck speed, supported by negative
real interest rates, EU grants, and strong real wage increases. GDP growth reached
13 percent in the first quarter of 2006, following on
from 10¼ percent in 2005. Consumption and
18
capital formation remain the main drivers of
16

demand while, on the production side, growth was
12

particularly strong in construction and domestic

trade. These patterns reflect the very rapid increase

in household credit and sizable spending on EU2
related projects and transfers, which nearly doubled -20

proved to be one-off, with a strengthening of
imports and some weakening of exports leading to
a negative contribution from net exports in early
2006.

With overheating becoming entrenched,
the current account deficit and inflation have
ratcheted up. Reflecting its role as the primary
outlet for domestic demand pressures, the current
account deficit remained above 12 percent of
GDP in 2005 and widened further in early 2006
(Figure 2, Table 2). Imports have grown strongly
on the upswing in demand, while a worsening
terms of trade (including as a result of higher oil
prices), higher income earnings on inward FDI
(mostly accruing to banks) and, more recently,
weakening export volumes have added to external
imbalances. As a result, gross external debt rose
to 101 percent of GDP in 2005, with net debt a
much more moderate 36 percent of GDP.
Headline inflation remains in excess of
6½ percent (year-on-year)—reflecting rising
world energy prices and harmonization of food
prices (both of which have a much greater

Beyond the headline figure, nontradables inflation has
risen significantly to 7 percent, reflecting the strength
of demand pressures that have allowed firms to
expand markups and achieve record profits. Staff
estimates that the positive output gap that emerged in
late-2004 widened to 1–2 percent of GDP at end2005/early 2006.

From a relatively strong starting position,
external competitiveness is being eroded by
exceptionally strong wage growth. Until recently,
solid growth in export volumes and rising shares in
major export markets suggested that Latvian industry
enjoyed a favorable competitiveness position (Figure 3).
In addition, comparisons of actual wage and price levels
relative to predicted values indicate that Latvia’s
exchange rate was slightly undervalued in 2004-05,
albeit by a smaller amount than in 2003. However, with
job-rich growth and heavy post-accession migration to
EU countries (officially estimated at 5 percent of the
labor force) pushing the unemployment rate down by
2½ percentage points to 7¾ percent over the two years
to early 2006, the labor market has tightened
considerably.

As a result, and together with de facto wage indexation,
nominal wage growth has accelerated steadily over the
past two years to reach more than 19 percent (year-onyear) in the first quarter of 2006. This acceleration has
outpaced productivity improvements by a wide margin,
leading to an appreciation of the unit labor cost-based
real exchange rate (ULC-REER).

Rapid financial deepening continues,
increasing bank exposures to credit and market risk.
Credit to private sector residents grew nearly 65 percent
in 2005, and the loan to GDP ratio reached 70 percent,
triple the level in 2000 and the highest in the EU8. New
loans are skewed toward household mortgages—which
almost doubled to 20 percent of GDP (though still well
below the EU15 average of 48 percent)—and are
increasingly denominated in euros (Figure 4). As a result,
housing prices have grown sharply (an annual rate of
about 50 percent through mid-2006) to reach relatively
high levels.3 While banks’ financial soundness
indicators remain strong—with very low nonperforming
loans (NPLs) and high profitability in both the Nordicdominated segment (serving mainly residents) and the
segment catering primarily to nonresidents4 (Table 3)—
these measures are backward looking. With the real
estate sector now accounting for nearly half of total
loans, direct and indirect euro exposures having risen
sharply (reflecting both the lifting of limits on open euro
positions following the repeg of the lats to the euro and
the rapid expansion in euro-denominated loans to
mostly-unhedged households) and banks dealing with
NRDs increasing their domestic loan portfolios, risks
have increased. Moreover, balance sheet mismatches
have widened significantly over the

1/ Balance sheet mismatches indicate vulnerability to macroeconomic shocks. Maturity mismatch (short-term debt

assets less short-term debt liabilities) indicates exposure to rollover and interest-rate risk; currency mismatch (debt
assets less debt liabilities in foreign currency) indicates exposure to exchange rate movements; and maturity and
currency mismatch (short-term debt assets less short-term debt liabilities, both in foreign currency) indicates exposure
to rollover and exchange rate risk. Data indicates that (i) banks' direct exchange rate risk is modest but growing, and
inherent to financial intermediation, their maturity mismatch is significant; (ii) the corporate sector is very prone to
exchange rate fluctuations; (iii) households’ exposure to exchange rate shifts increased sharply in 2005 on strong
growth in foreign currency denominated loans; (iv) the public sector is insulated against rollover risks but exposed to
joint maturity and currency mismatch, due to the BoL’s sizable foreign currency reserves.

7.
Notwithstanding a modest headline deficit, fiscal policy has been expansionary.
Despite a broadly stable headline deficit of 1¼ percent of GDP (on a national definition),
government spending increased sharply in 2005, covered by cyclically-buoyant revenues and
EU grants, and leading to a demand impulse of nearly 1 percent of GDP (Table 4).5 For
2006, a further substantial stimulus is in prospect as implementation bottlenecks associated
with spending EU grants recede, and other spending is covered by a widening of the targeted
deficit (¼ percentage point of GDP) and privatization receipts (¾ percentage points of GDP).
Significant overperformance of tax revenues relative to budget continued into 2006 which—

as in previous years—risks being used to fund additional spending. Looking ahead, the
government is planning a phased 10 percentage point reduction in the personal income tax
(PIT) rate to 15 percent beginning in 2007 in order to bring it into line with the corporate
income tax and to encourage legalization of the shadow economy.
8.
Monetary policy appropriately continues to lean against the wind of strong
demand and credit growth, but its effectiveness is limited by fully open capital markets
and the narrow-band exchange rate peg. With little autonomous leeway to influence the
pace of economic activity, the BoL has relied on a significant phased increase in the burden
of reserve requirements—raising the rate and broadening the base in recent years.6 But with
still sizable spreads between interest rates on credits and banks’ funding costs (Figure 5),
such measures are likely to exert at best only a temporary moderating effect on credit growth.
Subsequent to the mission, the BoL raised its refinancing rate by ½ percentage point to
maintain the interest rate spread following the ECB’s policy actions in the first half of this
year.
III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
9.
The discussions focused on an assessment of conjunctural macroeconomic and
financial sector risks, and the need for policy action. The authorities and staff shared the
view that EU accession and the deepening real and financial sector integration that it brought
were fuelling economic activity, but Government officials also saw a substantial contribution
from temporary factors. The mission took the view that measures were urgently needed to
moderate domestic demand in order to narrow imbalances, preserve external
competitiveness, bring forward compliance with the Maastricht criteria, and limit
vulnerabilities ahead of euro adoption. Government officials were, however, more sanguine
in their assessment of economic developments and, accordingly, were not planning a
significant change in the course of fiscal or other policies. The discussions also explored
policy options to moderate credit growth and enhance financial stability, as well as structural
measures to ensure medium-term competitiveness in the context of very rapid wage growth.
A. Macroeconomic Outlook and Vulnerabilities
10.
Government officials interpreted current macroeconomic developments as
largely benign. Finance Ministry officials welcomed Latvia’s dynamic growth as essential to
deliver income catchup within a reasonable time horizon; they also considered the economy
to be only mildly overheated at present. Other senior government officials attributed the rise
in inflation mainly to convergence in wage and price levels, rather than to overheating. They

The rate was increased gradually from 3 to 8 percent (against 2 percent in the euro area), and the base
broadened to include liabilities to foreign banks and all liabilities with a maturity in excess of two years.

took the view that the rapid pace of infrastructure spending should be maintained to prevent
growth bottlenecks and enhance competition that otherwise could add to inflation. It was also
suggested that the legalization of the shadow economy had recently gathered pace (as
indicated by rapid growth in VAT receipts), thereby significantly inflating measured GDP
growth.7
11.
BoL officials were less sanguine, and saw overheating as a concern that was
unlikely to subside in the near term. Rapid GDP growth, in combination with high core
inflation (headline excluding energy and food) and widening external imbalances, were seen
as indicative of a sizable positive output gap. High and rising capacity utilization rates and
the growing number of unfilled job vacancies also pointed to Latvia’s advanced cyclical
position.
12.
The mission expected domestic demand to strengthen in the coming months,
underpinned by rapid growth in private consumption and gross fixed investment. By
contrast, weakening competitiveness, and a narrowing of food-price differentials with other
EU members would likely contribute to a moderation in net exports. All told, for 2006 as a
whole, the mission projected growth to rise to 11 percent, the current account deficit to
widen to 14 percent of GDP, and core inflation to remain stuck at around 5¾ percent (with
headline inflation moderating on account of smaller increases in world energy prices).
13.
Beyond this year, the mission saw a gradual unwinding of recent economic
imbalances as its central scenario, but with a distinctly more disruptive outcome
possible were imbalances to remain unchecked. Rising household debt servicing costs, a
gradual slowing of credit (Box 2), and weakening external competitiveness would, under the
Box 2. Credit Growth Forecast
With credit behavior significantly impacting the growth outlook, a key question is how long rapid credit growth
is likely to persist. Commercial bank representatives considered Latvia to be some considerable distance from
credit saturation, the point where the credit-to-GDP ratio stabilizes. They expected credit ratios to converge to
Nordic levels (an average 114 percent of GDP, but considerably higher in some countries), with future credit
continuing to be channeled primarily into mortgages. Nonetheless, the pace of credit expansion was expected to
slow as borrowing costs—which had declined rapidly on falling spreads, the shift from higher interest rate latand dollar-denominated loans to euro loans, and lengthening maturities—approached their minimum. 1/ With
mortgage loan penetration still modest (13 percent of households), however, banks saw some potential for
expanding their client base, although the relatively low incomes of most of the population and house prices that
had reached very high levels would put limits on this process in the near term. All told, staff expects credit to
expand by more than 40 percent per year on average during 2006-07, compared with 64 percent in 2005.

The corollary of declining borrowing costs has been rising asset—primarily real estate—prices.

The very rapid growth in VAT collections is likely to reflect primarily a shift in the structure of GDP toward
consumption and imports and away from VAT-exempt exports.

baseline, gradually induce a slowdown in demand. This would contribute to a moderation in
inflation and a real depreciation of the lats which would support external adjustment (Box 3,
Table 5). But even under this soft-landing scenario, the output gap would continue to widen,
the current account deficit would decline only slowly, gross external debt would continue to
mount (Figure 6, Table 6), and the Maastricht inflation criterion would not be met by the end
of the projection period (2011). There are genuine risks, moreover, that negative real interest
rates and a substantial increase in EU-financed spending could frustrate this adjustment,
while an extended euro exile, coupled with continuing large current account deficits and
growing unhedged currency exposures, could call into doubt the viability of the gradual
adjustment scenario itself.
14.
BoL officials viewed rapid income convergence and accompanying imbalances as
posing significant risks, while some of the mission’s other interlocutors saw a helpful
role for foreign banks in mitigating such risks. BoL officials took the view that high debt
levels and large currency and real estate exposures raised the risks around the soft landing
scenario, particularly given the delay in euro adoption. However, private sector analysts saw
the prominent role of foreign parent banks in funding external imbalances (Box 4) as helping
to insulate Latvia from possible adverse shifts in sentiment toward emerging market
countries because foreign banks have their own funding sources and, moreover, exercise
strong oversight over the activities of their subsidiaries. The mission pointed to the sharp rise
in balance sheet (especially currency) mismatches of households and, to a lesser extent,
banks over the past year as evidence of growing vulnerabilities (Table 7) and cautioned that,
were banks to reassess their positions, markets could move suddenly and abruptly.

Box 3. Stabilizing Latvia’s External Liabilities
Servicing Latvia’s large external liabilities and moderating its dependence on foreign savings will
involve a sizable adjustment in the level and composition of the current account. Lane and Milesi-Ferretti
(LM)(2006) show that to stabilize net external liabilities (NFL) relative to GDP, Central and Eastern
European countries need to strengthen considerably their trade balances (or, more specifically, their
balances on the goods, services, current transfers, labor income, and capital accounts—the “gstl&k”
balance) to make room for servicing debt and equity capital. To get an indication of the magnitude of
adjustment in Latvia, one possible approach is to consider what size of current account deficit would
stabilize net external liabilities at some benchmark level.

1/ Real output growth is assumed to be 6.8 percent. Current transfers, wage income
and the capital account are set at long-term averages
2/ NFL is assumed to stabilize at an average for non-industrial countries equal to -51.4 percent
of GDP. Projected assets and liabilities for 2011 are reduced by the same ratio to generate this
value.
3/ Actual data for 2003-2006Q1.

Applying LM’s methodology, and using country-specific rates of return, Latvia would need to achieve a
gstl&k deficit of 1.2 percent of GDP over the medium term (against an actual deficit of 7.8 percent of
GDP in 2005) to stabilize NFL-to-GDP at 51½ percent (the average level for nonindustrial countries, a
possible benchmark).2/ With substantial increases projected in current and capital transfers and wage
income, reflecting rising EU grants and repatriation of labor earnings from Latvians working abroad, this
implies a needed improvement in the goods and services balance of 4 percent of GDP relative to 2005.
Factoring in the responsiveness of import demand to (i) the additional inflows and (ii) the adverse
balance sheet effects arising from a real depreciation, some improvement in competitiveness (of around
8 percent—but with significant uncertainty surrounding this estimate) would achieve this adjustment.
Part of this would come from unwinding prevailing overheating pressures, with the rest from gradual
productivity gains (see ¶27).

Indeed, even to stabilize NFL at 59 percent—the level at end-2005—would require a gstl&k
adjustment of 6¼ percentage points of GDP.

B. Macroeconomic Policies
15.
The mission considered that an upfront tightening of macroeconomic policies
was needed to contain near-term overheating pressures, and to reduce the size and
duration of the subsequent economic slowdown relative to the baseline scenario
(Table 5). Under an accelerated-adjustment scenario, a sizable front-loaded fiscal adjustment
would initiate a more restrained path for real wages and credit expansion directly through
taxing real estate and slowing public sector wage growth, and indirectly by fostering more
realistic expectations regarding medium-term growth prospects that would moderate bank
lending and ease demands for rapid wage catchup. Relative to the baseline, this scenario
would deliver slower near-term growth, a more rapid unwinding of the output gap, lower
inflation (the Maastricht inflation criterion could be met in 2010-11), a more depreciated real
exchange rate, a smaller current account deficit, and a leveling-off of foreign liabilities by
2010. Moreover, with a more gradual accumulation of vulnerabilities in the external and
financial sectors, it would reduce the risk of a hard landing that remains inherent to the
baseline.
Fiscal policy
16.
The mission cautioned that, in view of the extent of overheating concerns, fiscal
policy should, at a minimum, refrain from adding to demand pressures emanating from
the private sector. The authorities viewed fiscal policy as striking an appropriate balance
between prudence and the need to satisfy public investment requirements and to redress
public-private sector wage disparities. Finance Ministry officials pointed to the very low
level of public debt, the balanced budget position (on an ESA 95 basis) in 2005, and the
substantial surplus built up so far in 2006 as evidence of Latvia’s restrained fiscal policy. The
mission responded that a very rapid increase in government spending in recent years had
been masked by substantial inflows of EU grants (which are recorded as revenue) and strong
cyclical conditions, thereby keeping fiscal balances in check even as the fiscally-induced
demand stimulus has been substantial (Box 5). Moreover, government authorizations of EUfunded projects undertaken by the private sector and the signaling effect of large public
sector wage increases had also added to demand.

22
Box 5. Estimating the Demand Effects of Fiscal Policy
In addition to standard adjustments for cash-versus-accrual accounting, estimating the demand effects of fiscal
policy involves correcting for the impact of EU grants. This can be done by treating net EU grants (receipts less
contributions to the EU) as financing since these grants fund higher fiscal spending, whereas contributions to
the EU budget raise fiscal spending, but do not generate domestic demand.
In applying these adjustments to the Latvian context, it should be noted that the budget includes in revenue all
grants (“extended” government), even if final beneficiaries are in the private sector (a corresponding
expenditure item reflects on-payment to final beneficiaries).1/ Alternatively, a “narrow” government concept
would include in revenue and expenditure only EU grants for which the government is the final beneficiary and
the expenditures undertaken with these funds. On either definition, the appropriate concept for assessing the
demand effects of fiscal policy is the change in the accrual-adjusted balance excluding net EU grants.

Under the narrow government definition, staff expects a demand stimulus of ¾ percent of GDP in 2006—
significantly less than implied by the budget (2½ percent of GDP) due primarily to capacity constraints in
spending EU grants—with a smaller stimulus in 2007. With the private sector receiving a sizable share of EU
funds, the 2006 demand injection under the extended government concept rises to near 1 percent of GDP. How
the demand stimulus ultimately affects GDP will depend on spending propensities and multiplier effects.

23
17.
The mission stressed the need for expenditure restraint in 2006 and a sizable
front-loaded adjustment in 2007–08. In 2006, revenue overperformance should be saved in
full and any supplementary spending authorizations offset by spending cuts elsewhere. For
the next two years, an ambitious, front-loaded improvement in the fiscal balance should be
implemented to reverse the earlier demand injections and partially offset the private sector
stimulus. The 0.1 percentage point of GDP annual deficit reduction built into the authorities’
2005 Convergence Program falls well short of this requirement because it implies high real
expenditure growth. Rather, staff sees the need to contain real expenditure growth in 2007
and 2008 to 4½ percent and ½ percent respectively (against 9½ percent and 4½ percent
implicit in the Convergence Program) in order to counter the considerable public and private
demand stimulus already in train. This should be achieved through broad-based

expenditure rationalization, including self-financed spending, and by sequencing EU-funded
projects according to priority while deferring to the extent possible under EU rules those
projects (e.g., in construction) that would likely intensify pressures in already overheated
sectors. These policies would produce a headline fiscal surplus of ¾ percent of GDP in 2007
and near 2 percent of GDP in 2008. Moreover, the proposed reduction in the PIT rate—
which would boost households’ purchasing power at a time of already very buoyant
demand—should be put on hold.
18.
Officials were mindful of the advisability of avoiding a procyclical fiscal policy,
but saw limited policy options. Finance ministry officials noted that preparations were
already underway for a relatively modest supplementary budget to cover unanticipated costs
of hosting several international events, to be implemented after the October elections. They
further predicted that a sizable overperformance of the budget target would be infeasible this
year in view of pre-election spending pressures and large public sector wage increases. While
they did not expect significant changes in fiscal policy even after the elections (in part
reflecting an increase in EU funding in 2007), they considered it prudent from both cyclical
and budgetary perspectives to tie the PIT reduction to the launch of universal income and
asset declarations (planned for 2008), which they expected to yield a compensating boost to
tax revenues.

Monetary and credit policies
19.
BoL officials considered that the phased increase in reserve requirements had
achieved some measure of success in slowing credit growth, but were weighing the
benefits of additional policy tools. They viewed the reserve requirement policy as having
helped to contain bank lending because—by tightening lats liquidity conditions—temporary
upward pressure was exerted on money market rates. Moreover, since remuneration rates are
below banks’ funding costs, higher and more broadly applicable reserve requirements acted
to raise bank lending rates on both lats- and euro-denominated loans. With liquidity ratios at
several of the most active banks declining close to the current 30 percent minimum, the
authorities were considering increasing the liquidity requirement to 50 percent, a step
officials believed would dampen credit growth going forward.
20.
While welcoming the broadening of the reserve requirement base, the mission
cautioned against further moves that could introduce distortions. While the recent base
widening to encompass long-term liabilities had helped to eliminate a loophole, the mission
doubted that a further tightening of reserve or liquidity requirements would appreciably slow
overall credit volumes since borrowing could readily be diverted to nonbanks or offshore in
order to circumvent the measures. Moreover, by increasing lat relative to euro interest rates,
further currency substitution of loans would likely result and, because foreign subsidiaries
have ready access to liquidity from parent banks, the impact would fall disproportionately on
locally-owned banks.
21.
With most new credit directed to the undertaxed real estate sector, the mission
advocated tax-based measures to moderate mortgage lending. The generous tax
treatment of real estate and its uneven enforcement was acting to fuel speculative activity in
land and housing. The mission advocated broadening the PIT base to include capital gains on
all real properties (with the exception of an individual’s primary residence provided it had

25
been in the owner’s possession for more than three years).8 Complementing this with more
accurate reporting of the transaction price in the land register, which forms the base for the
property transfer tax, would also help to better identify capital gains. In response to these
suggestions, Finance Ministry officials reported that a Working Group tasked with improving
the accuracy of prices in the land register had been established; however, political support for
a more comprehensive taxation of capital gains appeared to be weak.
C. Financial Sector Issues
22.
The mission’s interlocutors confirmed that intensifying competition among
banks had contributed to a softening of loan standards, but views differed as to whether
risks had increased materially. Banking representatives acknowledged that the search for
market share had led to an easing of mortgage origination standards, with lengthened
maturities, higher loan-to-value and debt-to-income ratios, more loan issuance at floating
rates and in foreign currencies to unhedged households, and the introduction of bullet loans.
Nonetheless, the Latvian Financial and Capital Markets Commission (FCMC) and banking
representatives did not consider that risks had increased significantly because household debt
remained low (29 percent of GDP), the buoyant housing market allowed underlying
collateral to be readily sold, while euro adoption delay—if held to three-four years—would
not bring into question the currency peg. However, BoL officials reported that with capital
adequacy and liquidity ratios declining in recent years, its stress tests indicate that banks’
capacity to absorb a modest reduction in credit quality has deteriorated. The mission agreed,
and stressed that prevailing favorable macroeconomic conditions were a large factor behind
current very low NPL ratios. In the event of a significant tightening of global liquidity
conditions against the Latvian context of mostly variable rate loans, growing loan penetration
of households with more modest debt-servicing capacity would add to risks in the banking
sector. Moreover, a correction in house prices would impair loan quality, curtail lending, and
generate a sustained dampening effect on economic growth.

1/ The results indicate that a hypothetical 4 percentage point increase in the ratio of
NPLs to total loans at end-2005 would reduce the CAR of six banks—accounting for
more than 65 percent of the sector’s assets—below the prudential minimum of 8
percent. A similar-sized shock on mid-2005 data would leave the CAR of only two
banks—with a market share of less than 20 percent—below 8 percent.

23.
Regulatory options to contain the buildup in vulnerabilities associated with
rapid credit growth are limited in the EU context.9 In a setting where banking services
may be offered by local banks, foreign branches, and cross-border providers, the authorities
explained that domestic prudential regulations that are stricter than elsewhere in the EU may
easily be evaded by booking loans offshore. Moreover, they noted, with the introduction of
Basel 2, all EU members will be expected to implement uniformly the EU’s Capital
Requirements Directive, leaving little room for stricter national implementation of the
Directive, including in the areas of risk weighting of mortgages and loan-to-value rules. The
mission considered that shifting credit risk to offshore banks that can better bear risk has its
advantages, but urged that remaining policy flexibility be utilized appropriately. In
particular, the delay in euro adoption, the exchange rate risks associated with sizable external
imbalances, and the growing currency mismatches on banks’ balance sheets all point to the
need to treat the euro in the same manner as other foreign currencies in assessing capital
charges and setting prudential limits on net open positions. The mission also saw
considerable scope for increasing borrowers’ awareness of the currency, interest rate, and

Credit Growth” by V. Prokopenko in the upcoming Selected Issues Paper for 2006.

27
house price risks associated with borrowing, and for banks to better explain the implications
of different loan options and to inform borrowers of debt repayment obligations under
various adverse macroeconomic scenarios.
24.
The mission stressed that risks from rapid credit expansion and the impending
shift to Basel 2 call for strengthening relations with home-country supervisors and
improving domestic supervisory oversight and macroprudential analysis. Large foreign
subsidiary banks confirmed that, under Basel 2, a single credit-risk model would be applied
throughout entire banking groups. The FCMC assured the mission that, while the home
supervisor has final authority over internal risk models applied in host countries, the Latvian
supervisor would remain actively engaged in the oversight of the domestic financial sector
and maintain close cooperation with its Nordic counterparts. The mission stressed the need
for the FCMC to thoroughly review banks’ internal credit risk models and the
appropriateness of local calibrations. It further emphasized the need—in coordination with
relevant foreign supervisors—to be proactive in ensuring that banks maintain sufficient
capital to adequately cover direct and indirect risks in their portfolios. In addition, the
mission recommended that the BoL’s stress testing be refined to include simulations that
internalize feedback relationships among macroeconomic variables, borrower solvency, and
the level of bank capital, and that steps be taken to obtain relevant data on household
incomes, principal repayments, and foreign currency earnings.
D. Competitiveness, Labor Market, and Structural Policies
25.
Strong emigration, along with very rapid economic growth, were seen as helping
to close the wage gap with richer EU countries, but also as an emerging threat to
Latvia’s competitiveness. The

28
upward pressure on wages—primarily at the low end of the distribution—had created ripple
effects throughout the wage structure. BoL officials considered that, while the ULC-REER in
2005 was some 12 percent below its 2001 peak, recent trends were worrisome, particularly in
view of moderating export growth and the recent decline in the share of exports going to the
EU15. The mission observed that a range of indicators suggest that until recently Latvia
enjoyed a modest competitiveness premium, but that recent wage and price developments
had absorbed much of this initial advantage. They therefore called on the authorities to
dampen expectations of rapid wage convergence unsupported by productivity gains and to
abolish indexation of public-sector wages in order to eliminate the distortionary effect this
has on private-sector wage expectations.

A variety of tradeoffs were presented to the mission regarding the appropriate
policy response to Latvia’s growing labor shortages.11 Some analysts called for expanding
inward migration to alleviate shortages and dampen wage pressures. However, policymakers

increasing labor force participation by raising the untaxed minimum under the PIT.

There was widespread agreement that to sustainably narrow the wage gap while
preserving competitiveness would require a continuous upgrading of Latvia’s product
mix, rather than a change in the exchange rate parity. The mission observed that Latvia
has been slow to transform its product mix away from low-tech, low-skill goods in direct
competition with low-cost countries (Box 6), which may help to explain Latvia’s declining

29
penetration of EU15 markets. It therefore considered that Latvia’s medium-term
competitiveness would need to be safeguarded by moving up the value chain, to bring forth
productivity gains that could sustainably underpin wage growth. To this end, the mission
suggested that EU funds be used to their best advantage to: build human capital through
improving education outcomes and increasing business scientific know-how; facilitate
absorption of domestic and foreign technologies; integrate local firms into multinational
production chains; and improve infrastructure for viable sectors. The authorities and business
representatives agreed with this assessment and reported that, in adjusting to higher wages,
some sectors had begun to introduce labor-saving technologies, though the need for
substantial further progress was widely recognized.
Box 6. Latvia’s Export Structure
In the aftermath of the Russia crisis, Latvia
successfully reoriented the destination of its
exports, but failed to transform its product structure.
Exports therefore remain concentrated in resourceand labor-intensive goods (wood and wood
products comprise 30 percent of exports),
embodying inputs of low- and medium-skill blue
collar workers. Among the EU8, Latvia has—by a
wide margin—the largest share of low-tech, laborintensive exports which compete directly with
low-cost countries.1/ In contrast to several other
new EU members which are moving up the
technology ladder, in recent years Latvia has seen
some regression in the skill- and technologycontent of its exports.

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
The steady catch-up in living standards relative to the EU15 since the mid-1990s
has been a significant achievement; however, the current exuberant pace of economic
growth brings substantial risks that could disrupt future convergence gains. Both
private and public demand are pushing the economy well above its supply capacity and, as a
consequence, high inflation and large current account deficits are becoming entrenched,
adding to the economy’s already high external debt burden. Rapidly tightening labor markets
and unrealistic expectations of a quick narrowing of the wage gap with the EU are
amplifying risks of a wage-price spiral. While Latvia has to date enjoyed adequate
competitiveness, recent wage and price developments are rapidly eroding this advantage.
Households, corporates and banks are taking on large euro exposures, even though exchange
rate risk will remain a fact of life in the period leading up to euro adoption. Strong housing
demand, falling borrowing costs and speculative activity are fuelling an acceleration in house
prices and there is now a concern that a bubble is emerging.
29.
Steering the economy away from its overheated path and moderating
vulnerabilities are the key challenges. Restraining private and public sector demand in the
near term is essential to reduce the need—going forward—for a substantial and protracted
slowdown in growth in order to moderate price and wage inflation and restore
competitiveness. A front-loaded adjustment, moreover, is desirable to limit the buildup of
vulnerabilities in the external and financial sectors to reduce the risk of a disruptive
unwinding of imbalances, and to bring forward compliance with the Maastricht criteria,
thereby limiting the risks inherent in a prolonged delay in euro adoption.
30.
While Latvia’s economic setting limits the availability and effectiveness of
standard policy options, a broad range of measures—if pursued as a coherent and
clearly-communicated policy package—could generate significant results. In the context
of very rapid credit growth, macroeconomic and financial stability concerns are inherently
interrelated, calling for a combination of demand management and prudential measures.
Reining-in credit growth, unwinding the fiscal stimulus that has already been injected, and
securing an environment in which wage growth moves in line with productivity gains are key
elements of the policy package that is needed to reduce inflation, strengthen competitiveness,
and restore the current account to a sustainable level. A communications strategy that fosters
realistic expectations about income prospects and sets a feasible—though ambitious—
revised target date for euro adoption will help boost the credibility of the package. However,
in the event that higher private sector savings do not materialize, fiscal policy will need to
shoulder a greater share of the macroeconomic adjustment.
31.
With overheating apparent, fiscal policy must at a minimum avoid adding to the
already considerable demand pressure emanating from the private sector. Achieving
this goal will require a sizable front-loaded fiscal consolidation. As an immediate step, any
overperformance of revenues should be saved in full. Beyond this, an ambitious adjustment

31
is needed to reverse the fiscal stimulus added in recent years and to partially offset private
demand injections. This should be achieved by restraining real spending, focusing on ownfinanced items and those EU-funded projects likely to exacerbate bottlenecks, for example in
infrastructure. In addition, the planned reduction in the PIT rate should be put on hold until
overheating pressures have dissipated.
32.
The BoL should continue to lean against the wind of strong demand and credit
growth, but policies that would introduce distortions should be avoided. The recent
broadening of the reserve requirement base to encompass long-term liabilities is welcome,
and monetary policy should continue to track changes in the euro policy rate. But raising the
minimum liquidity ratio or further increasing the reserve requirement rate could divert bank
lending offshore and to less-regulated nonbanks, while leaving the overall pace of credit
growth largely unaffected. Moreover, these measures would promote further currency
substitution of loans, and place domestically-owned banks that cannot avail themselves of
additional liquidity from foreign parents at a disadvantage.
33.
The generous tax treatment of real estate needs to be curtailed to dampen
speculative activity and to moderate credit growth. To eliminate the loophole in the PIT,
realized capital gains on personal real estate holdings should be treated as income unless the
property is the individual’s primary residence and has been owned for more than three years.
More accurate reporting of the transaction price in the land register at the time of purchase
should be enforced to correctly measure capital gains and assess the base for the real estate
transfer tax.
34.
Efforts to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory framework are needed to
help restrain the buildup of risks in the financial and real estate sectors. Growing
currency mismatches and the revision to the euro timetable suggest that the FCMC should
amend prudential regulations to ensure that the euro is treated as any other foreign currency
until euro adoption. The imperative for close and effective cooperation with foreign
supervisors will increase with the introduction of Basel 2, and the FCMC will need to ensure
that foreign subsidiaries’ credit-risk models are fully appropriate to the relatively unseasoned
Latvian financial market, and that banks hold capital cushions sufficient to protect against a
possible increase in credit and market risk. Further refinements to the BoL’s stress testing
framework should also be considered to better simulate the feedback channels between
adverse macroeconomic shocks and the financial sector. To sharpen supervision and
oversight, more accurate data are needed on household incomes and debt servicing costs,
distribution of loans by size, and the share of unhedged households. Better education of
households about risks associated with borrowing is also needed.
35.
Safeguarding external competitiveness and avoiding a wage-price spiral in the
context of a tightening labor market calls for maintaining wage discipline while easing
labor market bottlenecks. Slowing domestic demand, improving productivity in the public
sector, and further increasing labor force participation would mitigate labor market pressures.

32
Allowing temporary immigration on a limited scale should also be considered to relieve
growth bottlenecks related to the scarcity of higher-skilled workers. Fostering realistic
expectations about the future pace of wage level convergence—including through the
signaling effect of public sector wages—would help to underpin the health of the tradables
sector.
36.
Boosting export performance while transitioning from a low- to a moderatewage country will require Latvian firms to scale the technology ladder. With most of
Latvia’s exports concentrated in low value-added products, moving up the value-added chain
would deliver productivity improvements to support growth in real incomes. Doing so will
require improving Latvia’s attractiveness to long-term investors through a credible
commitment to macroeconomic stability, reducing “red tape,” and exploiting the potential
catalytic role of EU funds to build human capital and business know-how, while facilitating
the absorption of new technologies.
37.
It is recommended that the Article IV consultation with Latvia remain on the standard
12-month cycle.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US
dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total
external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic
currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in
percent of GDP) remain at their levels of the last projection year.

VI. Projected Obligations to Fund: None
Exchange Arrangements:
The currency of Latvia is the lats, which was introduced in March 1993 to replace the
Latvian ruble. The exchange rate was pegged to the SDR from February 1994 to
December 2004, within a ±1 percent band. On January 1, 2005, the lats was repegged to the
euro at the rate € 1 = 0.703 lats, and on April 29, 2005, Latvia entered ERM2, maintaining
the previous band width. On August 23, 2006 the lats was equal to US$ 1.83. Latvia’s
exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions. Latvia maintains security-related exchange restrictions pursuant to
UN Security Council resolutions and EC Council regulations, which have been notified to
the Fund under Decision No. 144-(52/51), adopted August 14, 1952.
Article IV Consultation:
Latvia is on the 12-month consultation cycle.

41

The 2005 Article IV staff report was issued on July 15, 2005 (Country Report No. 05/282).
The last Article IV Board discussion took place on July 27, 2005. The Public Information
Notice No. 05/109 was released on August 10, 2005.
FSAP Participation and ROSCs:
A joint World Bank-International Monetary Fund mission conducted an assessment of
Latvia’s financial sector as part of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) during
February 14–28, 2001. The Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA) report was
discussed at the Board on January 18, 2002, together with the 2001 Article IV staff report
(Country Report No. 02/10). An AML/CFT assessment mission took place during March 824, 2006, and the report is under preparation.

APPENDIX II. LATVIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision to the Fund is adequate for surveillance purposes. In addition, the authorities
maintain a very open and well-articulated data dissemination and publication policy. Most
economic and financial statistics are reported to the Fund on a regular and timely basis, and
many additional economic and financial aggregates are readily available on the websites of
the Bank of Latvia (BoL) and Latvian government institutions and agencies. The authorities
are reporting data for the Fund’s International Financial Statistics, Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook, the Direction of Trade Statistics, and the Balance of Payments Statistics
Yearbook. Latvia has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and
meets its specifications for the coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of the data, and for the
dissemination of advance release calendars. Also, its metadata are posted on the Fund’s
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB, http://dsbb.imf.org). There is increased
cooperation on data issues between the Central Statistical Bureau (CSB), the BoL, the
Ministry of Finance (MOF), and the customs authorities.
Building on extensive Fund assistance for statistical improvements through the placement of
Resident Statistical Advisors from 1996 to 2000, further advice on statistical matters has
been provided by EUROSTAT as a part of the EU accession process.
A data ROSC mission in September 2003 found that the national accounts, the consumer and
producer price indices, government finance statistics (GFS), monetary and balance of
payments statistics generally follow internationally accepted guidelines on concepts and
definitions, scope, classification and sectorization, basis of recording, and valuation. The
consumer price index (CPI), however, excludes the services of owner-occupied dwellings.
The MOF should continue to be supported in its program to adopt the accrual standards of
the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) for expenditures and in its
practice of including all income and expenditure of the general government sector within the
Treasury accounting and statistical system. Monetary statistics should provide for greater
detail in the classification of the liabilities of depository corporations by subsectors of the
general government.
National accounts
The CSB compiles and publishes quarterly national accounts using the production and
expenditure approaches on a regular and timely basis, largely following the 1993 System of
National Accounts (SNA 1993) and the 1995 European System of Accounts (ESA 95).
However, there are significant discrepancies between the GDP estimates based on production
and those based on expenditure. The underlying data for the production approach are
obtained primarily through a comprehensive survey of businesses and individuals, and are
supplemented by data from labor force surveys and administrative sources. The CSB believes

44

that the basic data understate economic activity, particularly in the private sector, and there is
an ongoing effort to increase coverage. Meanwhile, official national accounts include an
adjustment for under-recording. Additional data for the expenditure-based accounts are
obtained from household budget surveys and other surveys from the State Treasury and
ministries.
Prices
The CSB compiles a nationwide consumer price index. With Fund technical assistance, it has
developed appropriate methodologies to deal with most of the technical problems resulting
from the major structural shifts that have occurred in the economy. Following advice from
EUROSTAT, the weights in the CPI basket are now revised annually. Also, the weights in
the producer price index are updated annually and the index covers almost three quarters of
total industrial activity. The CSB publishes export and import unit value and volume indices.
Government finance statistics
The staff is provided with monthly information on revenues, expenditures, and financing of
the central and local governments and special budgets. With some limitations, the available
information permits the compilation of the consolidated accounts of the general government.
The 2005 Government Finance Statistics Yearbook contains cash data in the GFSM 2001
format for 2004. Government finance data up to the month of December 2005 have been
published in the International Financial Statistics.
Monetary statistics
Monetary data are comprehensive, timely, and comply with international standards.
Specifically, data on the balance sheets of the BoL, commercial banks, and other financial
institutions, as well as the banking survey, are compiled with a very short time lag, i.e.,
within two weeks of the end of the reporting period. Fund staff is also provided weekly with
data on foreign exchange transactions, including outright interventions and foreign currency
swaps. The institutional coverage, classification, and sectorization of accounts comply with
Fund standards. Interest rate data are compiled and published with equally short time lags.
The BoL also reports comprehensive data on banking supervision and prudential regulations.
Latvia has adopted the ECB framework for compiling and reporting monetary statistics,
which provides the same detailed information as the Standardized Report Forms
recommended by the IMF to its member countries for reporting monetary data.

45

Balance of payments statistics
The BoL assumed responsibility for compiling the balance of payments statistics from the
CSB in early 2000, and since 2001 it has published monthly data. The data collection
program is a mix of quarterly surveys supplemented by the monthly information of the
international transactions reporting system (ITRS), banking statistics and administrative
sources. The three quarterly surveys employed to derive source data are: (1) a survey of
foreign investment covering data for direct, portfolio and other investment, and related
income flows of non-financial enterprises, (2) a survey of transportation and intermediary
services, and (3) a survey on other services.
The data source for general merchandise is foreign trade statistics compiled monthly by the
CSB, which, after becoming part of the European Union (the 1st of May 2004) include,
monthly data from the Intrastat report for intra-EU transactions and data from customs cargo
declarations for the extra-EU transactions. The Data ROSC mission of September 2003 noted
the need to improve procedures to ensure that goods passing through customs warehouses are
properly valued. Coverage of exports to Russia and CIS countries is incomplete; and reexports of cars and shuttle trade items are particularly difficult to capture. Estimates of travel
credits and debits have been improved through a revised survey. In general, survey
techniques need to be further improved. The improvements in survey techniques related to
private transfers better capture income that sailors and other Latvians repatriate to Latvia.
Regarding textile exports, the authorities found that many companies declared only the value
added part of their processed textile exports, although they reported the full value of
imported inputs. While these methodological improvements are welcome, revisions of past
data have been reported in February 2005 only from 2000 onwards in respect of current
transfers (credits) and exports of goods for processing. The resulting break in the data series
still limits their usefulness for analysis. Debt data from Latvia’s International Investment
Position (IIP) show a more rapid buildup of debt than is indicated by the BOP statistics, and
efforts are needed to explain and address this and other divergences between IIP and BOP
data. These issues were also highlighted by the Data ROSC mission of September 2003.

LATVIA: TABLE OF COMMON INDICATORS REQUIRED FOR SURVEILLANCE
AS OF JULY 31, 2006

Statement by Tuomas Saarenheimo, Executive Director for Republic of Latvia and
Juris Kravalis, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
October 4, 2006
On behalf of our Latvian authorities we would like to thank staff for the constructive dialogue
in Riga and the well balanced report. We welcome the choice of topics for the Selected Issues
paper and are in a broad agreement with staff’s analyses and recommendations.
Macroeconomic Outlook and Risks
Our authorities share staff’s assessment that, along with a strong economic performance and a
remarkable real convergence, overheating pressures have been strengthening recently. From
the medium-term perspective robust growth has been largely driven by such fundamental
factors as capital deepening, technological innovations, increasing utilization of labor stock
and efficiency gains leading to a substantial growth of total factor productivity. However, as
correctly argued by staff, deepening European integration and the prospects of the euro
adoption, in combination with historically lax international monetary conditions, have resulted
in a substantial decrease in nominal interest rates and sizable foreign inflows fuelling
domestic demand. While initially the surge in inflation was mainly supply-side driven, the
ongoing economic acceleration, widening of the output gap, changing growth composition,
and tightening of the labor market indicate that overheating pressures are becoming more
prominent in posing risks to macroeconomic stability and delaying the timetable for the euro
adoption.
Along with the risks associated with overheating and accumulation of imbalances in the
economy, in our opinion some risk-mitigating factors should have been more emphasized in
the staff report. Though our authorities are fully aware that the recent exceptionally strong
wage growth, should it continue in the medium-term, is a threat to external competitiveness,
there is rather mixed evidence about the extent to which the recent deceleration of export
growth has been influenced by the decline in external competitiveness. First, as shown also in
the staff report, the recent real appreciation of the lats still compares rather favorably on the
backdrop of a sizable past real depreciation and could partly be attributed to equilibrium
phenomena. The rapid wage growth, though increasingly exerting pressure on unit labor costs,
has been accompanied by sizable productivity gains, especially in the tradable sector. Second,
the recently moderate growth of market shares is at least partly driven by price fluctuations in
the world markets for several commodities having substantial share in Latvia’s export.
Another risk-mitigating factor is the nature of foreign inflows. External imbalances are mostly
financed by the banking sector’s long-term inter-company loans, i.e., loans from the parent
institutions located predominantly in the EU countries that diminish the risks of sudden stops
or reversals of foreign inflows.
Overall, given the increasing degree of the country’s economic integration, it seems fair to
conclude that economic developments in Latvia are increasingly dependent on the external

2
environment and external policy actions, and to this end the domestic policy package should
be assessed against the expected changes in the international policy stance.
Macroeconomic Policies
Our authorities acknowledge that macroeconomic policies should be considered in light of the
present economic developments and emerging challenges. We welcome staff’s support for the
recent monetary policy measures and recognize that even though having repercussions on the
money market and to some extent containing further credit growth, these measures alone are
not sufficient to bring the economy back to a sustained growth path given the liberal capital
markets and the fixed exchange rate.
We have taken note of staff’s concerns regarding possible implications of further increasing
banks’ minimum liquidity ratio and reserve requirements. Nevertheless, our previous
experience shows that, in the absence of other central banks’ instruments for containing credit
growth, such measures, while not entirely efficient, have a considerable signaling effect and
influence banks’ behavior towards more caution in lending activities. Considering excessive
credit growth as the core problem, we are of the opinion that such measures are still justifiable
and would not exclude further actions in this field. Moreover, with global interest rates
increasing, the impact of these measures on reducing credit growth may become more
substantial.
Nevertheless, in light of the currency peg strategy, the heaviest part of the adjustment burden
must fall on other policies, as correctly noted in the staff report, by shaping a comprehensive,
well communicated and credible policy package. Front loading fiscal consolidation,
maintaining sound financial system, ensuring wage discipline, easing labor market bottlenecks
and boosting export performance by pursuing policies supportive to scaling the technology
ladder, as recommended by staff, are instrumental to this end.
The fiscal policy in Latvia is broadly in line with the requirements of the Stability and Growth
Pact. Since 2001 the budget deficit has been relatively small and declining. The level of the
total general government debt has also been low. Our authorities have clearly expressed their
ambition to continue lowering the level of the budget deficit to 1.3 percent of GDP until 2008
and to achieve gradually a balanced budget in the longer run.
Our authorities agree that fiscal restraint would be useful to counter the sizable demand
stimulus which is already under way in Latvia. However, several factors have to be taken into
account when considering such options as saving revenue over performance in full in 2006 or
sharply curtailing spending growth in 2007–2008. A sharp spending reduction may affect not
only the overheated sectors, but also those sectors that are of crucial importance to the
economic and social development in Latvia. Given the increasing degree of the country’s
economic integration in the EU, easier access to foreign capital and the potential for further
financial deepening, the necessary adjustments required in some policy areas could be
disproportionate, and in some cases larger than practically feasible. Our estimates suggest

3
that, for example, any reasonable degree of fiscal adjustment, even as ambitious as the one
portrayed in staff’s accelerated-adjustment scenario, would not be sufficient to compensate for
the significant externally driven monetary stimulus in the medium-term provided that external
environment stays unchanged.
Against this background, in the present situation an appropriate fiscal policy option for Latvia
is to plan budget expenditure in the medium-term in line with the country’s development
strategy in general and operational strategies of central government institutions in particular.
Recently the government has taken the necessary steps to enhance strategic planning and
implement the medium-term budget by adopting the concept documents that envisage full
implementation of the medium-term budgeting from year 2008.
Financial Sector Issues
Our authorities appreciate staff’s comprehensive insight into the current situation, challenges
and opportunities of the Latvian financial sector. The challenge faced by policy makers in
Latvia arises from the integration of the European banking system with an evolving legal
framework and enhanced convergence of supervisory practices on the one hand, and not fully
solved home-host arrangements on the other, particularly in the case when the relative
systemic importance of entities within a financial group in the host and the home country
differs. The authorities consider the Fund as a useful forum for discussing possible measures
for strengthening the coordination mechanism between home and host authorities. In this
regard, we look forward to the results of the ongoing Nordic-Baltic Financial Sector Project.
Latvia’s integration in the EU has had an effect on our supervisory framework. Thus, in late
2004 the decision to lower the capital adequacy ratio from 10 to 8 percent was taken because
of the need to ensure a level playing field in the single European financial market for local
banks and branches of the EU banks. We believe that 8 percent is appropriate to the level of
risks taken by banks and risk-based supervision that ensures adequate measures to be taken by
individual institutions if weaknesses are identified. This will be further strengthened by
amendments to the legislation implementing the Capital Requirements Directive (Basel II)
effective from January 1, 2007. These amendments, inter alia, provide the supervisor with the
power to require a bank to have capital above the level calculated in the standard way.
On January 1, 2005, limits on open positions in the euro were lifted following the re-pegging
of the lats from the SDR to the euro. However, in the current situation the authorities share
staff’s view that open positions in the euro should be treated like any other foreign currency
and consider suspending the previously taken decision. Nevertheless, in our opinion, staff
somewhat overestimates bank exposures to credit and market risks. Banks have prudent risk
management policies and their open currency positions are hedged. Moreover, there is a
capital charge for the net foreign currency position, including in the euro. The liquidity ratio
of the majority of banks with a higher euro open position is close to the banking sector’s
average that is well above the regulatory minimum.

4
While we acknowledge that bank lending is only partially covered by local deposits, recently
the value of domestic deposits has increased by an impressive 44 percent (end March 2005 –
end March 2006). Furthermore, we consider that in Latvia’s context there is no empirical
evidence whatsoever of non-resident deposits increasing prudential risks. Also, such deposits
are generally concentrated in banks that specialize in servicing foreign clients and the majority
of the respective funds are matched by placements in the OECD countries’ banks or
investments in fixed income securities.
The authorities agree with staff that, in the event of a significant tightening of global liquidity
conditions, a growing loan penetration of households with a more modest debt-servicing
capacity would add to risks to the banking sector. However, we do not share staff’s view that
correction in house prices would impair the quality of loans. The Latvian legislation clearly
stipulates that loans can only be extended if a customer proves sufficient cash flow as a
primary source of repayment of the principal and interest, and there is no persuasive evidence
on the impact of a potential reduction in the market value of collateral on the cash flow of
customers. Nevertheless, more data on credit portfolio of banks would foster our supervising
capacities, thus the authorities are working to enhance considerably the credit register. We
also share staff’s view that the current situation in credit markets calls for more
comprehensive and accurate information on household finances, and are planning to introduce
additional surveys to tackle household income and debt issues.
The authorities would like to emphasize that a substantial strengthening of legal measures and
law enforcement has ensured a comprehensive and efficient AML/CFT framework in Latvia.
Latvia’s compliance was verified by the Fund’s assessors in May, 2006 and approved in the
MONEYVAL Committee of the Council of Europe on September 15, 2006. We would also
like to stress that the AMF/CFT rules apply equally to residents and non-residents. Thus, we
do not fully share staff’s conclusion that business with non-residents automatically involves
reputational risks.
Structural Issues
All in all, our authorities still see the competitiveness as adequate in the near future and such a
view was recently supported also by the World Economic Forum ranking Latvia in the 36th
place which is an improvement from the previous year, and places Latvia before a number of
European Union member states. However, we welcome staff’s support for the policies shaped
to safeguard competitiveness in the medium-term by moving up the value added chain and
increasing productivity further. The authorities are determined to use EU funds for building
human capital by improving education outcomes and increasing business scientific knowhow. A number of measures defined in the National Lisbon Program of Latvia for 2005 –
2008 are aimed at improving the education, human capital, research and development and
innovations, etc. The operational programs for the utilization of EU funds, which have been
approved by the government, also contain measures for improvements in the above mentioned
fields. In addition, the operational programs focus specifically on developing enterprises, in

5
particular SMEs. Also, implementation of the National Lisbon Program is already facilitating
the introduction of new technologies in resource and labor intensive industries, thus
permitting the production of high value added goods. Recent trends witness an increase in the
share of those goods, for example, in the wood-processing industry.
The authorities consistently work on improving the business environment through
implementing the annual Action Plan and supervising the effects of administrative procedures
on business. Thus, Action Plan for 2006 envisages targeting the tax policy and administration,
improving the legal environment, reducing ”red tape” and developing financing instruments to
facilitate SMEs seed capital and venture capital financing.
In response to rising labor shortages, our authorities consider raising the minimum wage and
untaxed minimum though they will still remain the lowest in the EU. We share staff’s call for
maintaining wage discipline. At the same time, our authorities acknowledge that after Latvia’s
accession to the EU, efficiency of domestic wage restrictions may be rather limited due to
changes in wage formation mechanisms. Wage developments are becoming increasingly
decoupled from productivity changes, and wage adjustments are determined by cross-country
conditions rather than cross-sectoral.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Latvia
On October 4, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Latvia.1
Background
The Latvian economy has made remarkable strides since the mid 1990s combining, for the
most part, macroeconomic stability with rapid income convergence. Relative to the 15 original
European Union members, per capita income in purchasing power parity terms has climbed
16 percentage points, among the fastest of the eight new Eastern European member states
(EU8). Inflation performance was also commendable until recently. While current account
deficits were larger than for most other EU8, they were broadly consistent with Latvia’s income
and growth potential. Nonetheless, reliance on foreign savings over an extended period has
caused net foreign liabilities to approach 60 percent of GDP in 2005.
Since 2004, the economy has experienced an integration-related boom. Deepening European
integration brought lower nominal interest rates, large disbursements of EU grants and external
inflows to domestic banks. As a result, GDP growth increased to record levels, and a positive
output gap emerged. Consumption and capital formation have been the main drivers of demand
while, on the production side, growth has been particularly strong in construction and domestic
trade. These patterns reflect the very rapid increase in household credit and sizable spending
on EU-related projects and transfers, which nearly doubled in the first full year of EU
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.

membership in 2005. Unemployment has fallen sharply, due to extensive outward migration of
labor as well as the strength of the growth, reaching 7¾ percent. Headline inflation has
remained in excess of 6¼ percent (year-on-year), reflecting higher core inflation as well as
rising world energy prices and the harmonization of food prices. The current account deficit has
remained above 12 percent of GDP.
Rapid financial deepening has continued, increasing bank exposures to credit and market risk.
Credit to private sector residents grew nearly 65 percent in 2005, and the loan to GDP ratio
reached 70 percent. While banks’ financial soundness indicators remain strong, the real estate
sector now accounts for nearly half of total loans. Direct and indirect euro exposures have risen
sharply, reflecting both the lifting of limits on open euro positions following the repeg of the lats
to the euro and the rapid expansion in euro-denominated loans to mostly-unhedged
households. As a result, balance sheet mismatches have widened over the past year.
Notwithstanding a modest headline balance, fiscal policy has been expansionary. Monetary
policy continues to lean against the wind of strong demand and credit growth, but its
effectiveness is limited by fully open capital markets and the narrow-band exchange rate peg.
With little autonomous leeway to influence the pace of economic activity, the Bank of Latvia
(BoL) has relied on a significant increase in the burden of reserve requirements—raising the
rate and broadening the base in recent years.
Strong growth is expected to continue in 2006. The ongoing credit boom and faster real wage
growth are expected to support private domestic demand, while increasing net EU grants will
boost public spending. Growth is projected to rise to 11 percent, and output will remain above
potential. The current account deficit is projected to widen to 14 percent owing to rapid import
growth, as well as rising profits of foreign investment, particularly in the banking sector.
Core inflation is likely to remain stuck at around 5¾ percent, although headline inflation may
moderate on account of smaller increases in world energy prices.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors praised the authorities for their sound macroeconomic management and
far-reaching structural reforms over the past decade, which have fostered rapid economic
growth and helped deliver impressive gains in Latvia’s living standards since the mid-1990s.
However, Directors were concerned that the current exuberant economic expansion, while
underpinned by the process of EU integration, is tilted excessively toward domestic demand,
bringing with it substantial risks that could disrupt future progress with income convergence.
In particular, Directors observed that the economy is now operating above its supply capacity,
with high price and wage inflation weakening Latvia’s international competitiveness advantage,
even as the private sector is taking on sizable foreign-currency denominated liabilities.
Directors considered that the key policy challenge is to steer the economy away from its
overheated path and to moderate vulnerabilities. Restraining private and public demand in the
near term was seen as crucial to limiting the buildup of external and financial sector
vulnerabilities. A front-loaded adjustment was also seen as bringing forward compliance with

3
the Maastricht criteria for euro adoption, thereby limiting the duration of exposure to risks
inherent to remaining outside the euro area.
Directors acknowledged that Latvia’s economic setting—with a currency peg and an open
capital account—constrains the availability and effectiveness of standard policy options,
but considered that a broad range of measures—if pursued as a coherent and clearlycommunicated package—could yield significant results. They recommended that this package
should focus on reining-in the pace of credit growth, unwinding the fiscal stimulus that has
already been injected, and securing an environment in which wage growth is tied to productivity
gains. To boost the credibility of the package, several Directors advised that a feasible, though
ambitious, revised target date for euro adoption be announced.
Directors counseled that, at a minimum, fiscal policy should avoid adding to the already
considerable demand pressure emanating from the private sector. As an immediate step,
this would require saving in full all revenue overperformance this year. Directors also urged the
authorities to limit the scale of any supplementary spending appropriations and to undertake
offsetting expenditure reductions. Beyond this year, they stressed that an ambitious front-loaded
adjustment is necessary to reverse the fiscal stimulus added in recent years and to partially
offset private demand injections. To achieve this goal, Directors recommended restraining real
spending, focusing on own-financed items and those EU-funded projects likely to exacerbate
bottlenecks, and postponing the planned reduction in the personal income tax rate until
overheating pressures have dissipated. Directors noted that, in the event the envisaged private
sector savings do not materialize, fiscal policy would need to shoulder a larger burden of the
adjustment. They observed that the authorities’ plans to enhance strategic planning and
implementation of a medium-term budgeting framework would help to move away from the
practice of supplementary budgets.
Directors commended the monetary authorities for instituting policies that lean against the wind
of strong demand and credit growth, including the recent broadening of the reserve requirement
base, and recommended that domestic policy interest rates continue to track those of the euro
area. However, they urged caution with respect to other measures, including raising the
minimum liquidity ratio and the reserve requirement rate, that could divert bank lending offshore
and to less-regulated nonbanks and promote further currency substitution, while leaving the
overall pace of credit growth largely unaffected.
Directors viewed the generous tax treatment of real estate as contributing to the very rapid
growth in mortgage credit and house prices. They recommended broadening the base of the
personal income tax to include realized capital gains on real estate holdings, excluding on longterm primary residences. Directors also called for more accurate reporting of the transaction
price at the time of purchase to correctly measure capital gains and assess the base for the real
estate transfer tax.
Directors called for strengthening the supervisory framework and macroprudential analysis in
order to constrain the buildup of risks in the financial sector. In view of growing currency
mismatches and delayed euro entry, they advised that prudential regulations governing banks
be amended to treat the euro as any other foreign currency. Directors emphasized that the

4
introduction of Basel 2 would increase the need for close and effective cooperation with foreign
supervisors of banks with Latvian subsidiaries or branches, and to ensure that subsidiaries’
credit-risk models are fully appropriate to the Latvian financial market. They also recommended
refining stress-testing scenarios to better simulate the effects of macroeconomic shocks, and
called for better educating households about the risks associated with borrowing. Directors
looked forward to the 2007 Financial Sector Assessment Program update, which they saw as
an opportunity to further address issues related to risks in the financial sector. They welcomed
the strengthening of the Anti-Money Laundering/Combating Financing of Terrorism framework,
but called for continued vigilance to safeguard Latvia’s position as a regional financial center.
In the context of the tightening of the labor market, Directors underscored the need to maintain
wage discipline and better link compensation to performance, including through the signaling
effect of public-sector wages, in order to safeguard external competitiveness and prevent the
emergence of a wage-price spiral. They noted that reducing overheating, improving productivity
in the public sector, and further increasing labor force participation would mitigate wage
pressures. Directorsn also considered that limited inward immigration could relieve growth
bottlenecks arising from skilled-labor shortages. To sustainably underpin real income growth
while boosting export performance, Directors noted the need for Latvian firms to move up the
value-added chain. This would require improving Latvia’s attractiveness to long-term investment
through a credible commitment to macroeconomic stability, reducing bureaucratic hurdles, and
exploiting the potential catalytic role of EU funds to build human capital and facilitate absorption
of new technologies.
