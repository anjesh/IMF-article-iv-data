MEXICO
Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2005 Consultation with Mexico
Approved by Anoop Singh and Carlo Cottarelli
October 19, 2005
Discussions. A staff team held discussions in Mexico City during July 5–15 and September
21–22, 2005. The team met with the Minister of Finance; members of the Board of the Bank of
Mexico; officials from the Ministry of Finance, Bank of Mexico, the Ministry of Economy, the
Ministry of Social Services, supervisors of Financial Institutions, and representatives of the
private sector and academic community.
Team. The staff team comprised Caroline Atkinson (Head), Steve Phillips, Gil Mehrez,
Vincent Moissinac (all WHD); Ales Bulir (PDR); Marco Espinosa (MFD); and Mazen Soueid
(ICM). Anoop Singh (WHD) joined the mission for the final discussions, and Mr. Schwartz
(Executive Director) and Mr. Calderon (Senior Advisor) also participated.
Previous consultation. The 2004 Article IV consultation was concluded on October 18, 2004,
with the Staff Report issued as IMF Country Report No. 04/419. Directors commended the
authorities for their continued pursuit of sound macroeconomic policies. Directors emphasized
that the key challenges going forward would be to bring inflation down to the long-term
objective, reduce debt vulnerabilities, reinvigorate the program of structural reforms, and
establish stronger mechanisms to ensure that a substantial portion of the oil windfall is saved.
Relations with the Fund. Mexico has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, sections 2, 3,
and 4, and does not have restrictions on payments for current international transactions
(Appendix 1).
Data. Comprehensive economic data are available for Mexico on a timely basis, and are
adequate to conduct surveillance. Mexico has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination
Standard, and its metadata are posted on the Fund’s Data Standards Bulletin Board. The data
module of the ROSC for Mexico was completed in May 2003 and published as IMF Country
Report No. 03/150.
Selected Issues Papers. The companion Selected Issues paper comprises four chapters:
(i) Mexico’s saving rate, its evolution and determinants; (ii) the evolution of bank credit in a
context of significant financial sector reforms; (iii) the development of the local debt market
and its implications; and (iv) the informal sector and its effects.

I. CONTEXT AND KEY ISSUES
1.
A shift in policies and economic structure over the last decade has fortified
Mexico’s economic fundamentals and produced a stronger and more stable economy.
Fiscal consolidation has reduced the ratio of gross public debt to GDP below 50 percent, and
the structure of the public sector balance sheet has been strengthened. Monetary policy has
brought inflation down to the low single-digits and gained increasing credibility, in the
context of an inflation targeting regime and floating exchange rate. A series of reforms has
strengthened the financial sector and boosted its development, while NAFTA contributed to
opening the economy further and integrating it in the world economy—with fast-growing
manufacturing links to the U.S. At the same time, the multi-party democracy has developed.
These improvements are reflected in Mexico’s investment-grade rating, uninterrupted access
to foreign capital at low cost, and resilience to shocks, such as the 2001–02 recession of the
world economy.
2.
Still, as the authorities well recognize, challenges remain to entrench
macroeconomic credibility fully, and achieve rapid sustainable growth. Fiscal policy has
earned broad credibility as annual targets have been met. But it has yet to be set in a mediumterm framework that would promote effective management of oil wealth over time and
further strengthen the public sector balance sheet. Inflation has come down, but remains
above the central bank’s 3 percent target. Most fundamentally, structural reforms are needed
to achieve a transition to high growth. Although there is now broad acknowledgement of the
need for reforms—in the energy and telecommunications sectors, the labor market, judicial
system, tax system, and regulatory and business environment—political stalemate has
frustrated the achievement of many elements of the reform agenda established by the
administration of President Fox. Constitutional disputes between the executive and congress
this year suggest that the practice of multi-party democracy continues to evolve, even as the
country prepares for the July 2006 elections that will turn over the presidency as well as all
seats in congress.
3.
Recent Article IV consultations with Mexico have emphasized consolidation of
the public finances and management of oil income, continued inflation reduction and
enhancements of the monetary policy framework, and the need for structural reforms.
By and large, staff has agreed with the authorities on their objectives of continued progress in
these areas, and so the discussions have usually centered on the specifics, and the appropriate
pace, of moving ahead. On fiscal policy, saving of rising government oil income has
generally been less than suggested by the Fund (although in 2004 savings turned out to be
greater than projected at the time of the consultation). The authorities have emphasized that
political consensus in favor of saving oil income has been weak, especially as projected oil
prices have continued to rise. They have pointed in particular to Mexico’s large investment
needs, including in the oil sector, with a potentially high return. On monetary policy,
disinflation has proceeded, and continuing development of the inflation targeting framework
has addressed issues of transparency and communication, although a detailed inflation
forecast is not published. On the structural policy front, the Fund has supported the wide
agenda defined by the Fox administration, much of which required congressional approval,
while regretting that implementation of this agenda has fallen short of the authorities’ goals.

-4-

4.

In this context, the 2005 consultation discussions focused on:

•

Fiscal policy: the need for a medium-term framework to promote fiscal consolidation
and improve management of oil wealth.

•

Monetary policy: evaluation of the policy stance following a period of rapid
tightening, and the operational development of the inflation targeting framework.

•

Financial markets: the implications of the significant reforms and development of
credit and bond markets in recent years and the remaining financial reform agenda.

•

Competitiveness and reforms: the challenges to raise productivity, competitiveness
and growth.

•

Safeguarding confidence and stability in the run-up to the 2006 election and over
the medium-term.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

5.
The economic recovery that began in mid-2003 continued into 2005, but at a
substantially slower pace (Figure 1). A broad-based expansion of economic activity in
2004, driven by a rebound of private consumption and private investment, took growth up to
4.4 percent. Growth slowed to 2.8 percent in the first semester of 2005,1 mainly reflecting
sector-specific developments, including a soft patch in U.S. industrial production, re-tooling
in the automobile sector, and lower agricultural yields. At the same time, domestic demand
began to moderate, and an increasing share of demand fell on imports rather than domestic
production.
6.
The economic recovery was accompanied by a boost to confidence, capacity
utilization, and formal employment. By early 2005, business confidence recovered to its
pre-recession level, as did capacity utilization in manufacturing, although both have slipped
in recent months. Formal employment grew by 4.6 percent from end-2003 to July 2005. Still,
the labor market remains dominated by informal employment (see Selected Issues paper).
Out of the economically active population of more than 43 million, only 12.8 million persons
were employed formally in the private sector as of mid-2005.
7.
Bank credit to the private sector has grown at a fast pace, starting in mid-2003.
Consumer and housing bank credit showed the fastest rates of growth, but from a very low
base. Nonbank financial intermediaries continue to play an important role in these new
markets (Box 1), although bank lending in these sectors is catching up. The availability of
new credit has helped the recovery of investment, especially in the housing sector. Private
investment expenditure was up more than 8 percent in 2004 and by 6 percent in the first half
of 2005.

Compared to the corresponding semester of 2004. Measured relative to the previous semester, seasonallyadjusted growth was 1.2 percent (on an annualized basis).

Box 1. Bank Credit Growth
Following years of contraction,
commercial bank lending to the
private sector has resumed
growing—and at a fast pace.
Credit growth has been relatively
rapid in consumer and housing
lending, markets first taken up by
nonbank intermediaries following
the 1994–95 financial crisis
(Figure 1).
The underlying factors are
multiple: the recovery of activity
and confidence; continuing
disinflation; greater competition
in the financial sector; and
banking reforms which
strengthened balance sheets while
improving tools to assess the
creditworthiness of potential
borrowers and enforce collateral
(see Selected Issues paper for a
description of the reforms and a
study of their effects). In the
housing sector, government
guarantees and direct lending
programs leading to the introduction
of conforming mortgages have also
played a key role.

Although bank credit still lags that of
other countries (Figure 2), its fast
growth—provided it continues to be
based on adequate risk management
frameworks—will continue to
enhance banks’ financial intermediation and growth-promoting
role. So far, despite the rapid growth
of new lending, the stock of total
bank financing as a share of GDP has
increased only moderately because
banks have also been writing off non-performing loans, many from the 1994–95 crisis, at a fast pace.

Importantly, other domestic sources of financing, such as corporate debt, are also expanding. Nonbank
financial intermediaries (Sofoles), whose lending is now close to a third of commercial banks’ financing,
have shown particularly fast growth (Table 1). These institutions do not take deposits and are licensed to
grant credit to specific segments of the economy. The bulk of their financing comes from the government,
but they have started to tap the private market. Mortgage Sofoles are the most important type.

-7-

8.
After rising through 2004, inflation has moderated in 2005, although it remains
somewhat above the 3 percent target—as does expected inflation (Figure 2). The
12-month headline inflation rate peaked at 5.4 percent in November 2004, but declined
thereafter with the unwinding of last year’s supply shocks as well as a moderation of core
inflation. Headline inflation moved below 4 percent in August 2005. Overall core inflation—
which had been little affected by supply shocks—has also come down, to 3.3 percent, while
wage increases have been steady at around 4½ percent. Nevertheless, inflation expectations
for end-2006, and for the next several years, remain somewhat above the official inflation
target—averaging about 3.7 percent as of September.2
9.
The Bank of Mexico (BoM) signaled an end to its monetary tightening cycle in
June 2005, and initiated an easing in August. The tightening of monetary conditions in this
cycle was substantial—with the overnight interbank interest rate rising from about 5 percent
in early 2004 to near 10 percent by spring 2005. From early 2004, the BoM has taken a
number of steps to enhance its communication with markets, including through beginning to
signal a desired minimum level of interest rates. While retaining its traditional corto
instrument, the BoM started using changes in the corto to signal changes in the overnight
interbank rate, and directed the market’s attention to the shorter, more focused press releases
following its regular monetary policy meetings. From May 2004, the BoM used these
statements also to link movements in the overnight interest rate to hikes in the U.S. Fed
Funds rate. In June 2005, the BoM dropped this link to U.S. policy and emphasized instead
Short-term interest rates, corto increases, and U.S. Federal Funds Rate.

the need to maintain the present monetary stance, signaling the end of the tightening cycle.
Two months later, the BoM announced that monetary conditions could ease by up to 25 bp
(but without changing the corto). In September, a further 25 basis point cut was signaled,
bringing the interbank rate down to 9¼ percent (still with no change in the corto).

2

While this is within the 2–4 percent inflation “variability range,” the authorities have emphasized that the
inflation target is 3.0 percent.

The fiscal accounts improved in 2004 on the strength of rising oil revenues and
restraint of current expenditures (Figure 3). The authorities achieved their target for the
traditional deficit, 0.3 percent of GDP, and the broadly-defined deficit (the augmented
deficit) narrowed to 2 percent of GDP, from 3.1 percent in 2003. After rising in 2003, current
expenditure returned to its 2002 level as a share of GDP. Rising oil revenue helped finance
an increase in capital expenditure, particularly in the oil sector. However, the 2004 outcome
on the augmented deficit also reflected in part a “temporary saving” from oil revenues, in that
0.4 percent of GDP of funds earmarked for additional PEMEX investment were not yet spent
in 2004. Gross public debt declined to 46.5 percent of GDP, in part through the write-off of
some of the bank restructuring debt.
11.
In 2005, oil revenues are rising again, but the impact on the broader deficit is
being more than offset by a deterioration in the non-oil fiscal balance. The spot price of
Mexican oil averaged US$ 41.6/bl through
Public Sector Debt, 2004
September, almost 15 dollars above the price
assumed in the budget. Oil income for the year
2004
is now projected by staff to be up by about

12.
As in previous years, the increase in the
government’s oil revenue was moderated by energy
pricing policies that shielded consumers from rising
world prices. Most significantly, gasoline prices “at
the pump” have increased only in line with the
domestic inflation rate, as a once substantial excise tax
on gasoline has been steadily reduced. Revenue on this
tax has fallen from a peak of 1.8 percent of GDP in
2002 to 0.7 percent of GDP in 2004, and to a projected
0.2 percent of GDP this year.

continued rise in oil exports and household remittances compensating for some
widening of the non-oil trade deficit (Figure 4). With the recovery of economic activity in
2004, imports of investment and especially consumer goods grew strongly. Weak auto

Mexican financial markets have recently performed strongly, as have other
emerging markets (Figure 5). Sovereign bond spreads have continued to decline. As
elsewhere in Latin America, both the stock and currency markets have tended to strengthen.
At end-September, the stock market was up more than 70 percent (in domestic currency
terms) since end-2003, with much of that gain coming since April of this year. From late
April through early August, the peso gained some 7 percent against the dollar, amid
indications that foreign investors were increasingly attracted by the significant interest rate
differential with the U.S. and growing signs that the BoM’s effort to reduce inflation would
succeed.4 The BoM has continued to abstain from market purchases of foreign exchange, but
rising foreign exchange receipts from the state-owned oil company (PEMEX) have tended to
push NIR upward.5 NIR reached US$ 61 billion by end 2004, about 4½ months of Mexico’s
imports and 1.6 times its short-term external liabilities.

The authorities have taken further steps to reduce vulnerabilities associated with
the public debt. The average maturity of the domestic debt of the federal government was
extended to 3.1 years by June 2005, up from 2.6 years in early 2004 (and 1.5 years in 2000).
Exposure to currency depreciation has declined further as the public sector’s annual foreign
exchange earnings from oil now exceed US$ 30 billion, against interest payments on its
foreign debt of US$ 9 billion. Furthermore, the authorities used the oil stabilization fund to
hedge the government’s external oil revenue for 2005. Finally, at mid-year the authorities

Subsequently, the peso shed about 3 points of this gain, through end-September.

The BoM accumulates NIR mainly as a result of the considerable foreign exchange cash surplus being run by
the public sector (including PEMEX). To moderate the rate of NIR increase, the BoM sells a pre-announced
portion of the resulting increase back into the market, a rules-based mechanism in place since 2003.

III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
A. Outlook
16.
It is clear that GDP growth for 2005 will be lower than last year’s strong pace.
This moderation reflects a slowdown of growth already seen in the first half of 2005—though
the consensus view is that much of this weakness reflected sector-specific shocks that may
soon fade. Accordingly, staff project growth

Mexico’s growth performance. The staff’s

projection is therefore contingent on the
current consensus view that U.S.

-4
downturn. The authorities broadly shared this
2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006
view of the outlook, while considering growth
in 2005 likely to be somewhat higher.
17.
Inflation is projected to converge gradually to the 3 percent target. Staff expect
that inflation will end 2005 at somewhat below 4 percent, declining to about 3½ percent at
end-2006 and 3 percent in 2007. The projection for 2006 and 2007, somewhat below those of
private forecasters, assumes no new substantial supply shocks; it also assumes that the BoM
will conduct policy with a focus on achieving the 3 percent target, and that private
perceptions of the credibility of that objective will continue to strengthen, albeit gradually.
The BoM has indicated that it expects inflation to end this year somewhat below 4 percent,
and to decline further in 2006.7
18.
The main uncertainties for the near-term outlook include developments in the
U.S. economy, global liquidity conditions and the possibility of shifts in confidence. A
moderate slowdown in the U.S. would have an immediate adverse effect on Mexico’s
economy through its impact on exports, confidence, and FDI (a more challenging U.S. shock
scenario is discussed in Section IV). Sectoral considerations will also be important, including
the performance of new auto models manufactured in Mexico for the U.S. market.
6

Such external “prefinancing” does not necessarily extend to other parts of the public sector, such as PEMEXrelated debt. In addition to external bond issues, part of the prefinancing was achieved through an exceptional
US$2.9 billion purchase of foreign exchange from the BoM in July 2005.
7

While the BoM did not offer a specific forecast for 2006, the government’s budget proposal assumes inflation
will end that year at 3.0 percent.

- 15 Confidence could also become more fragile if for example, as few consider likely, the
political environment were to deteriorate such that doubts began to surface about the
commitment to macroeconomic discipline.
19.
Medium-term growth prospects have upside potential, depending on the
prospects for political breakthrough on structural reforms. While the authorities
continue to project somewhat higher medium-term growth than the staff (3.6 percent versus
3.1 percent), this relatively small difference reflects staff’s more conservative judgment of
the growth effects of financial sector reforms and the ongoing recovery of investment, and is
within the margin of error of such estimates. Staff and the authorities agree that a transition
to a significantly higher growth path requires comprehensive structural reforms. As noted,
reforms critical to unwind the most pressing supply-side constraints have been identified for
some time in the energy sector, telecommunications, labor market, judicial system,
governance and the regulatory system.
B. Fiscal Policy
20.
The authorities emphasized their commitment to maintaining fiscal discipline,
noting also the broad public consensus for such discipline. The traditional deficit target
was met in 2004, as has been the case in recent years. Furthermore, the deficit has been
declining during the past few years and the draft budget for 2006 aims at a small surplus on
the traditional measure. The augmented deficit had also been reduced, and this was
supporting a gradual decline in the public debt/GDP ratio.
21.
Regarding 2005, the authorities expected again to meet their deficit target, with
the windfall (unbudgeted) oil revenue used to offset non-oil revenue shortfalls and
expenditure overruns from budgeted levels. Oil windfall revenues are projected to be close
to 1 percent of GDP, of which about one third would be transferred, according to budget
rules, for investment projects by PEMEX and the states. The remaining unbudgeted oil
revenues would be used mainly to compensate for revenue shortfalls from budgeted levels,
and additional expenditures partly to accommodate spending changes made by congress.
Thus the non-oil augmented deficit would widen in 2005, more than offsetting the slight
improvement of 2004. Still, the overall fiscal outcome was expected to be adequate to
support a small decline in the public debt ratio.

- 16 22.
The mission recognized that broad fiscal discipline had been maintained in recent
years, but noted that the fiscal position has come to rely increasingly on high oil prices. Oilrelated revenue is estimated to have increased by almost 2½ percentage points of GDP since
2002, reaching nearly 40 percent of revenue in 2005. Government receipts would have increased
by a further 1½ percent of GDP if increases in world market prices had been fully transmitted to
domestic consumers, rather than offset with reductions in gasoline excise taxes—see Box 2. The
mission noted that budgetary expenditures had risen somewhat during this period, while part of
the additional oil income essentially compensated for declining non-oil revenues (partly
reflecting a phased income tax reduction approved in 2004). The overall result, comparing 2005
to 2002, was a reduction of the overall augmented deficit by about 1 percent of GDP, but a
significant widening of the non-oil augmented deficit by about 1¼ percent of GDP.8 Thus, if oil
prices were to decline compensating measures would need to be taken swiftly to avoid a
weakening of the fiscal position. The authorities noted their efforts to direct new spending away
from programs that would create spending inertia, although they recognized that additional
spending was being undertaken by states, as a result both of rising transfers and borrowing on the
strength of future transfers. They noted also that in 2004 unbudgeted oil revenues helped to
support additional investment, particularly in PEMEX, where public investment could have a
high financial return, and represented a form of saving.
23.
Setting fiscal policy in a context of oil income volatility and uncertainty over future
oil prices is inherently complex. The authorities observed that the system of budget adjustors
used in Mexico in recent years was focused on addressing fluctuations of oil prices affecting a
single budget year. The approach helped assure achievement of annual fiscal deficit targets, but it
was not geared toward managing income from a multi-year oil price boom.9 Moreover, without
an established mechanism for identifying “temporary excess” oil income, disputes on its size and
use had dragged on in congress. Indeed, the authorities noted the broader difficulty of finding
consensus with the congress on fiscal policy—as illustrated by the fact that the 2005 budget had
gone to the Supreme Court, and still remains under dispute.
24.
The authorities agreed that Mexico would benefit from a new medium-term
framework for setting the fiscal policy stance and managing oil income. They pointed to a
reform proposal now in congress, which would take a more medium-term approach, based on an
oil reference price. The proposed budget law would establish, as an ongoing target, that each
annual budget be balanced when evaluated at an oil reference price. The authorities expected that
a zero balance on the traditional measure would be consistent with an augmented fiscal deficit of
about 1½ percent of GDP and a tendency for the public debt ratio to decline.10 In contrast to past
practice, the oil price used in the budget would aim to capture a long-run, or underlying price,
8

From 2002 to 2005, the augmented deficit excluding gross oil revenues is projected to have widened by 1.3 percent
of GDP. The non-oil augmented deficit (defined as the deficit excluding oil revenues net of PEMEX operational
expenditure and interest) widened by 1.2 percent of GDP.
9

As staff noted, without a medium-term perspective on the oil price, if oil prices stay high for some time or rise
from year to year, most of the defined oil windfall oil in a given year could become part of the budget assumption in
the following year, associated with a permanent increase in spending.

10

In terms of accounting, excess oil income that flows into the oil saving funds when oil prices are high would be
recorded as a expenditure in the traditional budget measure (a transfer payment, above-the-line), while withdrawals
from those funds when oil prices are low would be recorded as above-the-line income. The augmented budget
measure would adjust for this.

- 17 -

Box 2. The Mexican Energy Sector Amid Rising Fuel Prices
The energy sector is a smaller part of the Mexican economy than in many other oil-exporting
countries. At the same time, the sector is critical to the fiscal accounts, because the sector is entirely
state-owned, and because non-oil tax revenue is low, although the policy of smoothing of domestic
gasoline prices somewhat dampens the fiscal gains (and losses) from changing world oil prices. The
existing fiscal framework for managing oil income focuses on achieving annual fiscal deficit targets; it
is not designed to save a large share of the income from a multi-year oil price boom.
The energy sector is a relatively small part of Mexico’s economy. After domestic energy needs are
met, Mexico is able to export oil in an amount that represented about 4 percent of GDP in 2004. For
comparison, this oil export/GDP ratio was around 15–20 percent for Ecuador, Norway, Russia, and
Trinidad and Tobago, and 30–50 percent for Algeria, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela.
Domestic use takes up a substantial part of Mexico’s energy production—and some fuels are
imported. Of crude oil production, about 45 percent is consumed in Mexico and the rest exported.
Mexican production covers about 90 percent of domestic consumption of refined oil products, and
about 80 percent of domestic use of natural gas; imports provide the balance.
Mexican oil has a somewhat lower than average value. Mexican oil production is mainly heavy
crude, and the price of the Mexican oil mix tends to be some US$5–10/barrel below the world average
(APSP) petroleum price. The size of this discount has widened recently, implying that recent “oil
windfall” gains have been somewhat less in Mexico than for other oil exporters.
Nevertheless, oil income is of great significance to the Mexican public finances, reflecting state
ownership of the sector and the low level of non-oil tax revenue. The fully state-owned company
PEMEX is the sole producer of crude oil, natural gas and refined products, and the sole marketer of
refined products in Mexico, as required by the country’s constitution. With rising prices, PEMEX’s
total sales reached US$69 billion in 2004, or about 10 percent of GDP. PEMEX accounts for a critical
share of public sector revenue, which reached nearly 40 percent in 2005. This reflects also that non-oil
tax revenue in Mexico is relatively small, about 10 percent of GDP.
Investment and oil reserves: For many years, PEMEX investment had been relatively low, below the
level required to maintain a stable level of proven reserves. After 1996, however, oil investment has
grown steadily, through expansion of PIDIREGAS investments.1/ From an average annual US$7 billion
in 2000–02, PEMEX investment in 2003–05 is expected to average US$11 billion (an increment of
about 0.6 percent of annual GDP). Currently, proven oil reserves are the equivalent of about 11 years
of annual oil production. PEMEX expects the reserve replacement ratio to reach 100 percent by 2010,
if the recent investment rate is maintained.
PEMEX governance issues: PEMEX’s board is comprised of government officials and union
representatives. Without a clear mandate to maximize the value of PEMEX, there is a potential lack of
transparency and accountability of the management process, allowing the company to pursue a range of
objectives. The fact that PEMEX’s budget is part of the federal budget assures that any quasi-fiscal
activity by PEMEX will be reflected in the fiscal statistics, but this relationship may at times constrain
the company’s ability to maximize its value. Moreover, the ban on private equity financing requires
PEMEX to have relatively high debt, and it also prevents the Mexican government from diversifying
its assets away from the high-volatility energy sector and thereby reducing the volatility of its income.
1/

PIDIREGAS investments are infrastructure projects first executed and financed by the private sector and later
transferred, as well as the debt associated to them, to the public sector.

Box 2. The Mexican Energy Sector Amid Rising Fuel Prices (continued)
Macroeconomic impacts of rising oil prices
With no private ownership in the Mexican energy sector, when world oil prices rise, all
incremental income accrues to the public sector.
From a macroeconomic viewpoint, an increase in world oil prices could be thought of as an
increase in a tax on consumption of oil, but this effect is largely offset in Mexico, as consumers
are shielded from rising world prices. The government’s oil windfall (based on all sales, domestic
and foreign) exceeds the nation’s windfall (which arises only from exports). In practice, however, the
government’s windfall is dampened because gasoline excise taxes are adjusted to smooth the price
paid by domestic consumers. Domestic gasoline prices are administered, generally set to rise at a rate
similar to that of inflation. For example, as world oil prices have risen, revenue from the gasoline
excise fell from 1.8 percent of GDP in 2002 to a projected 0.2 percent of GDP in 2005. (Moreover,
most consumers receive electricity at a subsidized price, with a fiscal cost of 0.8 percent of GDP
recently.)
In terms of short-term economic growth, rising oil prices may be expected to have a slightly
negative effect in Mexico. Again, the Mexican private sector receives no profit income from the
energy sector. In practice, much of the potential drag on domestic demand from higher prices has
either been avoided (by not passing price increases to consumers) or has been offset by a deterioration
of the non-oil fiscal balance. The most relevant channel on growth is through higher oil prices’
potential negative impact on the U.S. economy, in turn affecting Mexican exports.
Fiscal framework for oil income fluctuations
The fiscal framework for oil income has taken a year-at-a-time approach. The framework is
centered on distributing the within-year oil windfall (that is, excess oil income defined relative to the
budget’s assumptions, rather than to a long-term oil price).
In practice, actual oil prices and revenue have exceeded budget assumptions in recent years.
The advantage of having a conservative budget assumption lies in avoiding the need (in order to meet
a deficit target) to cut budgeted expenditures if the oil price declines unexpectedly during the budget
year. Such a budgeting approach may also help contain the growth of recurrent expenditure programs
that would add inertia to government expenditure.
Each year’s budget law then specifies a formula for distributing any oil windfall. However, the
windfall for this purpose is measured after first compensating for shortfalls in budget revenues and
financing overruns in certain non-discretionary spending (including for example spending arrears
from the previous year, higher interest payments, and higher energy costs).
This approach to oil price fluctuations has been consistent with the achievement of annual
targets for the traditional budget deficit. At the same time, saving of the incremental oil income
since 2002, as measured by the narrowing of the augmented fiscal deficit, has been limited, for
several reasons. First, in the budget adjustors, “excess” oil income is defined relative to an annual
budget assumption that has been raised over time. Second, as noted, this excess income is defined net
of certain negative developments elsewhere in the budget. Finally, the budget adjustors formulas
agreed each year specifically assure that an important fraction of the remaining windfall will be spent.
In short, the framework is not designed to achieve financial savings of temporary income from a
multi-year oil price boom, but rather to support compliance with annual deficit targets.

- 19 determined according to a pre-set formula (rather than by annual negotiations with congress),
thus smoothing expenditures over the oil cycle. The proposal would also reduce the range of
potential “leakages” whereby unbudgeted windfall oil income during the year is measured
net of certain negative developments elsewhere in the budget, before being distributed to
spending or saving.
25.
The mission agreed that these changes would represent a step forward, while
noting areas in which such a new framework could be enhanced. First, it would be
desirable to anchor fiscal policy by linking the framework to a medium-term debt objective.
While focusing operationally on the fiscal balance, the framework could explicitly establish
an objective for gradually reducing the public debt ratio. The authorities saw the point, but
were concerned that proposing agreement on a specific debt target level at this stage would
complicate and likely delay congressional approval. They also noted their expectation that
the proposed deficit target would be consistent with a gradual decline in the public debt ratio.
Second, the staff observed that the new approach—while it should support a greater saving of
oil income than in the past—would put rather low upper limits on such saving. The proposal
would establish three saving funds, but once these reached certain levels (about 1½ percent
of GDP, for the combined funds), all subsequent oil windfall money would go to
expenditure. The mission suggested easing, or eliminating, these limits on saving, but the
authorities felt that a consensus for a greater saving of oil income was not yet established.11
The saving funds would still provide an important cushion, and they emphasized that the
proposed framework was symmetric: during times of low oil prices, dissaving would also be
limited.
26.
With regard to the 2006 budget, the mission supported the authorities’ intention
to maintain consolidation efforts and increase saving of oil revenue. To reduce the public
debt further, the mission recommended reducing the augmented deficit to no more than
1½ percent of GDP in 2006, and in any case to avoid a weakening of the non-oil balance. In
September, the authorities submitted a draft budget that was in line with the medium-term
fiscal scenario set out by the government in its 2002 economic program. The budget thus
aimed at a small surplus on the traditional balance, and an augmented deficit of 1½ percent of
GDP, based on general expenditure restraint and an oil price assumption of US$31.5 per
barrel (about one-third below prices for the Mexican oil mix prevailing in September 2005).
Should oil prices turn out higher than the budget’s assumption, the outcome for the
underlying fiscal stance—as indicated by the non-oil augmented balance—would again
depend on the budget’s procedures for allocating unbudgeted oil income. Based on the
proposed budget mechanisms, as well as consideration of potential leakages and pressures
likely to emerge again in budget negotiations, staff project that the non-oil deficit would stay
essentially constant in 2006 (this projection is based on a cut in the expenditure ratio from
2005, although not as large as the decline in the budget proposal).

11

The Chilean fiscal framework, for example, requires saving the entire amount of the government revenue,
from the state-owned copper company, that is associated with copper prices in excess of a medium-term
forecast price.

- 20 C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
27.
The authorities explained that the tightening of monetary conditions in 2004 and
2005 had been necessary to contain, and then reduce, inflation. Following a series of
supply-side shocks that pushed up the headline inflation rate, the authorities had been
concerned to see rising private inflation expectations in 2004 and moved quickly to avoid
second-round effects and a potential de-anchoring of expectations. Beyond that goal, policy
action had been required to take inflation down to the 3 percent target—the authorities
emphasized that a settling of inflation in the upper part of the 2–4 percent “variability range”
would not be acceptable.
28.
The mission agreed that the tightened stance had prevented spillovers of
temporary price shocks, and helped to further the convergence of inflation to its target.
Wage increases had not accelerated, and inflation expectations had been revised downward.
By mid-2005, both core inflation and inflation expectations had eased.
29.
Against this backdrop, the mission agreed that it had been appropriate to end
the monetary tightening cycle in mid-2005. The tightening had taken short-term real
interest rates up to around 6 percent, and some of the effect of this tightening action on
demand was likely still in the pipeline (subsequent to the mission, it became clearer that
domestic demand was moderating). Barring unexpected new inflation pressures, the stance
appeared to be sufficiently restrictive to support convergence to the inflation target—raising
the issue of the timing and pace of phasing out the tight stance.
30.
The authorities emphasized that the policy stance was continually reassessed for
consistency with the inflation target, noting several complexities and risks of the
current setting. Although the economy had grown rapidly in 2004, the authorities did not
yet see generalized demand pressures on prices. With the recovery of credit, arising mainly
from structural factors, the link from monetary policy to domestic demand was less certain,
complicating assessment of the appropriate policy stance. The substantial interest rate
differential with the U.S. also raised several considerations. Were this to lead to a significant
short-term real appreciation of the peso (along with other underlying factors pushing up the
real rate, such as rising oil exports and remittances), monetary conditions would effectively
tighten further. The authorities also noted that the attractiveness of the Mexican capital
market to foreigner investors, partly spurred by current global liquidity conditions, was
difficult to predict.

31.
The mission broadly shared this assessment, noting that the timing and pace of
easing was linked also to the need to entrench recent credibility gains. Moving too soon
or too rapidly could risk being misread as a sign that the BoM was satisfied with inflation
near the top end of the variability range (as currently suggested by indicators of market
inflation expectations). However, given the restrictiveness of the policy stance, and taking
account of monetary policy lags, it would be natural to begin relaxing the stance ahead of
actually achieving the 3 percent target. The importance of solidly anchoring market
expectations on the official target, in order to realize the full benefits of the inflation targeting
regime, would argue for a gradual and cautious approach to easing until inflation
expectations finally coincide with the target.
32.
The authorities explained the role that enhanced communication has played in
the functioning of the inflation targeting framework, with a number of key operational
changes since early 2004. Importantly, policy announcements during that period have been
shortened to a single page, have emphasized that the central bank’s target is 3 percent (not
the 2–4 percent variability range), and most fundamentally have guided more explicitly the
evolution of short-term interest rates. It is clear to markets, the authorities noted, that
monetary conditions and monetary policy are now increasingly conceived of in terms of the
overnight interest rate. That said, the authorities were on the whole comfortable with the
continued use of the corto as the official policy instrument, and did not see a clear case to
shift now to an explicit interest rate target. In its August and September communiqués, the
central bank signaled that interest rates could fall, but did not change the corto. Some
analysts viewed this as a further shift toward using the interest rate as the policy tool, while
others felt that the authorities wanted to send a more moderated signal to the market than
might have been implied by a cut in the corto. Staff acknowledged that the current
operational approach had proven workable so far, as the BoM had demonstrated effective
control of the overnight interest rate; however, they also suggested that moving to a single
instrument would provide more clarity to markets.12
33.
The persistence of private inflation expectations above the official inflation
target—at all horizons—raises the question of what more could be done to enhance the
policy framework. The mission welcomed that the BoM has conveyed publicly its own
projection of inflation over the near term (e.g., since January 2005, the BoM has stated its
expectation that headline inflation would decline enough to end the year just inside the 2–
4 percent variability range). The mission suggested that if the BoM were to go further—by
publishing a forecast corresponding to a conventional monetary policy horizon, or by
announcing a “convergence horizon” within which policy aims to achieve the 3 percent
target—this could help manage private expectations, in turn making it easier to achieve the
inflation target. The authorities saw the potential for such a benefit, but considered that it was
still outweighed by the risks they had cited earlier of losing flexibility and credibility in a
fast-changing economic environment, especially in the period before convergence with the
target (“the final disinflation step”) has been achieved.
12

The use of the corto (a borrowed reserves objective) as a monetary policy instrument was a subject of much
discussion in the past, when interest rates were fluctuating strongly. Many market analysts expect it to be
eliminated at some stage.

- 22 -

34.
Finally, it was agreed that Mexico continues to be well-served by its floating
exchange rate regime. The mission commended the authorities’ adherence to a floating
exchange rate regime, accompanied by a rules-based reserve accumulation policy. The rule’s
formula for selling back reserves, although essentially a rule of thumb, has the key advantage
of being transparent and avoiding the suggestion of an exchange rate target. The staff
believed that the level of reserves was reasonably healthy, but further accumulation was not
problematic, and in fact could provide some support to confidence in an election year
context. The authorities noted that the “carrying” cost of reserves had climbed, with the
widening Mexico-U.S. interest differential, but viewed this as a temporary phenomenon that
was already being reversed.
D. Financial Sector Issues and Policies
35.
The mission noted continued improvement of a wide set of financial sector
indicators (Table 5). In particular, the mission noted the strong offsite supervision of the
risk management practices of commercial banks and the largest nonbank financial
intermediaries (the mortgage Sofoles13), increased reliance on market discipline mechanisms,
and the growing participation of institutional investors with large assets under management.
In addition, commercial banks are adequately capitalized, profitable, and appear to have
sound risk management systems. Nonperforming bank loans (NPLs) are relatively low at less
than 2½ percent of total loans, down from 5 percent at end 2001. Banks have also built
sizeable provisions against NPLs, with coverage ratios around 200 percent. Recent stress
tests by the authorities show that commercial banks would withstand severe market and
private credit risk shocks. While credit growth has been partly supported by guarantee
schemes (targeted to SMEs) through which development banks take on credit risk, these
schemes are still limited in size (around 0.2 percent of GDP at mid-2005).
36.
Although potential risks to the financial system appear limited in the short-term,
continued vigilance and increased efficiency in the allocation of credit to the private
sector remain essential. While Sofoles’ non-performing loans remain low (about 2.7 percent
of total loans), they have shown an upward trend this year, suggesting the need for Sofoles
and their supervisors to closely monitor the quality of their credit (taking into account that
non-performing loans are often a lagging indicator). The mission also noted that commercial
banks’ exposure to the public sector, although stable, remains high. In addition to making
banks sensitive to potential changes in the value of government securities, these claims can
crowd out the private sector, contributing to lower access to bank funding and potentially
higher financing costs.
37.
The authorities explained that the near-term reform agenda included corporate
governance, the bank resolution framework, and the optimal supervision of Sofoles. A
proposed new securities market law, which has been submitted to congress but has run into
intense counter-lobbying, aims at raising corporate governance standards and encouraging
13

Sofoles do not take deposits, are licensed by the Treasury to grant credit to specific segments of the economy
and the bulk of their financing comes from the government through the state development banks, although they
have started to tap the private market.

- 23 -

smaller firms to use equity finance by strengthening minority shareholder rights. The
government is in the final stage of preparing new bank resolution legislation. Although there
are already a series of procedures for prompt corrective actions in place, the passage of a new
bankruptcy law would eliminate some loopholes that currently could complicate the
resolution of financial institutions. Finally, the authorities plan to allow Sofoles to branch
into leasing and factoring, de-regulating those Sofoles that do not take deposits from the
public, and thus are not seen as representing a systemic risk.
38.
The authorities were also considering steps to promote more diversified
investment strategies among private pension funds (Afores). Although Afores’
regulations have been changed to allow greater diversification and thus efficiency,14 Afores
continue to invest heavily in mostly short-duration government instruments. Most Afores
invest in very similar portfolios, perhaps because they do not derive much of their income
from the value of their assets under management. To lessen this investment concentration,
each Afore has had to establish two mutual funds, one entirely in fixed-income securities,
and another one in debt securities and equities. The authorities are in the process of finetuning this “benchmarking” in coordination with the industry.
39.
The mission welcomed Mexico’s track record in financial reforms. As
documented in the two Selected Issues papers on the banking sector and domestic debt
market, an impressive series of reforms has strengthened the stability of the banking sector,
while promoting nonbank sources of financial intermediation. A number of the 2001 FSAP’s
key recommendations have been addressed, including in the area of the payments system,
banking regulation, and offsite supervision of banks’ risk management practices. In order to
better assess the current strengths of the financial system and to serve as a reference for the
next administration, the authorities plan to soon request an FSAP update.
E. Vulnerabilities and Measures to Boost Resilience
40.
The authorities underscored that economic fundamentals are solid and resilience
to shocks has been fortified. The level of gross public sector debt, at around 45 percent of
GDP, does not raise concerns of sustainability, and the current fiscal stance is already
adequate to avoid a rise in this debt ratio. Furthermore, the average maturity of domestic debt
has increased in recent years. As the government has shunned dollar-indexed debt and shifted
away from external debt, and as oil export prices have risen, there is no longer concern about
the budget’s net exposure to peso depreciation. External debt is mainly long-term, and the
authorities consider that the federal government will not need to issue in the global bond
market before 2007.
41.
Staff agreed that Mexico’s economy has been considerably strengthened. The
exchange rate is flexible, the commitment to low inflation is credible, and exchange rate
14

Afores’ regulation had been characterized by strict investment limits with a strong bias toward liquid,
inflation-indexed domestic government securities. However, recent legislation has enabled the Afores to invest
in foreign securities, domestic equity, and derivatives. In time, regulation has de-emphasized the maturity,
currency denomination and origination characteristics of the assets held by Afores, in favor of regulation
emphasizing Afores’ credit risk management.

- 24 -

pass-through to inflation has become low. Moreover, the public sector balance sheet
especially is stronger than in the past, and compares favorably to other emerging markets’ in
terms of exposure to currency depreciation. Furthermore, external debt, and external
financing needs, of both the public and private sectors are smaller in Mexico than in many
other countries, and the modest current account deficit has been more than covered by FDI.

42.
Still, the mission noted that further steps to bolster resilience continue to be
important. Annual public sector financing needs are estimated to exceed 10 percent of GDP,
and the fiscal position could be affected significantly by an oil price decline (as a rough rule
of thumb, a decline in the oil price of US$10/bl reduces government revenue by about
1 percent of GDP). While Mexico’s public debt ratio is not out of line with other OECD or
emerging market countries,15 there is room to reduce public sector financing needs by
reducing that ratio and also by further extending the average maturity of the public debt—
especially of the domestically-issued debt, which was 3.1 years at mid-2005.16 17 In addition,
an estimated 17¾ percent of GDP in public domestic debt carries a floating interest rate or is
short-term. The authorities agreed that further extending the maturity of the public debt is

several off-budget activities.

- 25 -

important; they also noted that most of the public sector’s financing need was in terms of
pesos, and that account should also be taken of the public sector’s liquid assets.18
43.
Staff observed that its analysis of various potential shocks (Annex V) illustrates
the importance of continuing to extend the effective maturity of public debt. While
calculations show that a “confidence shock” episode19 with a hike in interest rates and a
sharp depreciation, along with weaker growth, could put the public debt on an upward path,
the rise would be fairly limited. However, gross public sector financing needs could rise
significantly if a shock were sustained and the authorities were forced to rely on short-term
debt to finance amortization. The mission, therefore, underlined the importance of reducing
rollover risk and continuing to seek an extension of debt maturity, even if interest rates were
to become less favorable.
44.
Like other emerging markets, Mexico would be challenged by a scenario
involving lower U.S. and world growth, especially if it were prompted by a significant
loss of confidence in U.S. assets and rising foreign interest rates. In such a setting,
Mexico would be particularly affected through its important export links to the U.S. and by a
demand-induced drop in world oil prices. Economic activity in Mexico would be strongly
affected. Moreover, in the absence of new fiscal measures, the augmented fiscal deficit could
widen by several percentage points of GDP (mainly from the oil price and interest rate
effects). In such a scenario, it was agreed, an early and decisive fiscal policy response would
be essential.
F. Structural Reforms and Competitiveness
45.
A political breakthrough on major structural reforms appears unlikely in the
context of the run-up to the 2006 elections. The mission noted that public awareness of the
need for reforms had improved significantly over the past several years, as a result of the
government’s efforts. Still, full-fledged reforms critical for medium-term growth, including
governance, labor market, energy and telecommunication sectors, and taxes, would probably
have to wait. Some political analysts suggested that a window of opportunity for reform
would come during the parliamentary session immediately after the elections (September–
December 2006), before the new President takes office.
46.
In the meantime, the authorities emphasized they would continue to press for
smaller-scale reforms aimed at improving structural competitiveness for specific
sectors. Already, a number of laws dealing with specific sectors (mining and farming) and
public procurement had been approved so far in 2005 through a special working group on
competitiveness in the Senate—established in 2005 with broad political, business, and public
sector participation. Progress was also being made through administrative measures to reduce
red tape at the local level and to enhance tax collections. The authorities will continue this
18

They noted, for example, that IPAB, the public entity that accounts for an important share of the short-term
domestic debt, held liquid assets of about 1.5 percent of GDP at mid-2005.
19

The mission noted a consensus among private analysts that a sudden shock to confidence is unlikely, as
neither economic fundamentals nor acceptance of the need to maintain macro policy discipline are likely to
deteriorate quickly.

approach in 2006, through further addressing regulatory concerns identified by the private
sector. Another area of progress was regional economic integration, which a recent security
and prosperity partnership agreement with the U.S. and Canada is expected to promote.
47.
The mission welcomed these efforts, highlighting the need to move ahead with
reforms of PEMEX corporate governance. Higher oil prices, and higher resource flows to
PEMEX, made it more important than ever to assure PEMEX’s optimum performance.
Administration proposals of governance reforms for PEMEX had not advanced in congress.
48.
The mission noted that progress on the structural reform agenda would help
counter a loss of competitiveness in the face of intense competition from China and
other markets with lower wages. Conceptually, such competition was pulling against the
tendency of the real exchange rate to appreciate as a result of higher oil export prices (and the
spending of some of the additional oil income on domestic goods and services). For now,
given the current external terms of trade, the real exchange rate is broadly in equilibrium.
The real exchange rate has been fairly stable, and the current account deficit has remained
small, implying declining external debt ratios. The mission observed also that the non-oil
trade deficit had not greatly weakened, and that the growth of non-oil exports was
continuing, at a respectable though not dynamic pace. On the other hand, the rate of FDI into
Mexico was rather low by international comparison, and the mission and authorities agreed
that Mexico’s competitiveness will face ongoing risks, highlighting the need for structural
reforms (Box 3). The authorities noted the relative lack of high productivity manufacturing in
Mexico to which resources could shift as traditional maquila manufacturing was gradually
moving to markets with lower wages. Looking forward, it would be important to encourage
investment and enhance competitiveness by improving the supply of skilled labor and
modern infrastructure, and by addressing high production costs (especially energy and
telecommunication) and problems of public and corporate governance.

Box 3. Competitiveness of the Mexican Economy
Mexico’s share of world export markets has returned to the levels it jumped to just after NAFTA a decade ago. The
increase in the value of exports in the late 1990s seems to have been cyclical in nature and in 2004 the volume of exports
was no higher than in 1996–98. The decline in world export market share—effectively a decline in Mexico’s share of the
U.S. market, to which Mexico exports almost 90 percent of its goods—appears related to increased competition from China.
Recent data from the BoM suggest that Mexican and Chinese products compete head on in about one-half of commodities,
the value of which is equivalent to three-quarters of their total exports to the United States.

Mexico's market share (pct change)

An analysis of manufactured exports suggests that Mexico is
not well-positioned in the major dynamic markets.1 The figure
above plots the changing world market share of Mexico’s major
manufacturing exports against the changing share of those
products in world trade, with the size of each “bubble“
representing the value of Mexico’s exports in 2003. With the
exception of car parts and furniture (quadrant I), most of
Mexico’s exports are either in commodities whose share in the
world market is declining (quadrants III and IV) or Mexico’s
commodities are losing share in an expanding segment
(quadrant II).

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
49.
Mexico’s economy has come a long way in the decade since the 1994/95 crisis,
with profound changes in economic policies, institutions and structure, although
further challenges remain. Confidence in the public finances has been achieved with
declining fiscal deficits and improvement of the structure of the public sector debt. In the
context of a floating exchange rate, monetary policy has brought inflation down to the low
single-digits. A series of reforms has strengthened the financial sector and boosted its
development, while NAFTA contributed to opening the economy further and integrating it in
the world economy. Moreover, policies are now formed in a setting of a multi-party
democracy, stronger institutions, and greater transparency of government. However, growth
of per capita income has been lackluster in the last decade, with important parts of the
structural reform agenda stalled. Looking ahead, the challenge to Mexico is to entrench the
considerable progress on the macroeconomic policy front, and to launch a new round of
structural reforms that will permit a transition to a rapid growth path.
50.
Fiscal policy has earned broad credibility with a track record of hitting annual
deficit targets, albeit through reliance in recent years on rising oil revenue. The reduced
deficit on the traditional measure—together with restraint of the off-budget flows that are
transparently reported in the augmented balance—has allowed some decline of the public
debt ratio. This achievement, however, has been increasingly dependent on rising world oil
prices. While the non-oil fiscal deficit narrowed somewhat in 2004, it appears to have
weakened in 2005 (as in 2003). The gradual expansion of the non-oil deficit makes the
budget potentially vulnerable to a reversal of these favorable conditions. So far, the
government has absorbed much of the potential domestic impact of higher international oil
prices through reducing fuel excise taxes, and by increasing subsidies to electricity
consumption. The institutional and political environment has also made it difficult to save a
high share of the additional oil income that does flow to the budget, but this remains an
important goal.
51.
As the authorities recognize, Mexico would benefit from orienting fiscal
policymaking more toward medium-term objectives, for which a revised fiscal policy
process may be needed. A proposed budget law now in congress would replace year-at-atime decision-making on the fiscal stance and the use of oil income with a system centered
on achieving a zero budget deficit over the medium-term, based on a medium-term reference
oil price. A system along these lines would be a step in the right direction. It would be
important also to press for a medium-term objective of further reducing the public debt that
would promote the saving of an important share of revenue gains from oil price booms that
may last several years. A medium-term fiscal framework for Mexico should also explicitly
formulate policy in light of the size of oil reserves and oil-related investment needs. In the
meantime, including in 2006, a further deterioration of the non-oil augmented balance should
be avoided. The authorities have rightly emphasized the need to address medium-term fiscal
pressures, including through their proposed reform of public sector pensions. Certainly, a
reform to address the longstanding structural weaknesses of the tax system will be needed,
and it is unfortunate that the authorities’ earlier proposals in this direction have not found
political consensus.

- 29 -

52.
Having firmly established a low inflation environment, monetary policy’s
challenge now is to achieve full credibility of the 3 percent inflation target. The
stabilizing advantages of the inflation targeting regime will be more fully realized when
private expectations are aligned with the official target. The central bank acted appropriately
to ensure that a rise in inflation and inflation expectations in 2004 would not become
entrenched, and to push inflation down toward the 3 percent target. It is reassuring that both
core inflation and inflation expectations have been moving downward in recent months.
Barring strong new shocks, the focus in the near-term can be on gauging the appropriate pace
for phasing out the restrictive policy stance. In continually assessing the balance of risks, the
authorities will want to take into account the added importance of an anchor in an election
year context as well as the remaining small but persistent gap between private inflation
expectations and the inflation target.
53.
The effectiveness of monetary policy has been supported by important changes
in the operational framework implemented since early 2004. Together these have
enhanced policy communication, including especially the shift towards defining policy
changes in terms of an interest rate target. The central bank’s indication of its inflation
forecast for the current year is also helpful, and it is recommended that this important form of
communication be extended to a somewhat longer forecast horizon, to further aid the private
sector’s understanding of the central bank’s objectives.
54.
Mexico has made considerable progress in terms of strengthening the financial
sector and its supervision. Reforms in the financial and capital markets area have advanced
considerably during the Fox administration, with a view not only to avoiding systemic
vulnerabilities but also to providing a supportive financial environment for economic growth.
An encouraging sign is that bank credit has begun to expand after many years of stagnation.
The authorities recognize that financial reform and supervision must be an ongoing process,
and their intention to request an FSAP update is welcome.
55.
In terms of reducing potential vulnerabilities, Mexico has applied well the
lessons of the 1994/95 crisis, and the authorities’ efforts to further solidify the
macroeconomic framework are commendable. Much has been achieved, of which staff
would emphasize the strengthening of the public debt structure and of the financial system,
and the anchoring of expectations on low inflation rather than an exchange rate objective.
These and other policies are reflected in much-improved levels of a wide set of vulnerability
indicators. As the authorities continue the process of building Mexico’s resilience to shocks,
it will be especially important to keep extending the maturity of all domestic debt and to
reduce the level of interest rate-linked debt.
56.
Mexico is well-served by maintaining its floating exchange rate regime, including
as an adjustment mechanism to external shocks. Currently the country’s real exchange
rate is subject to opposing forces, as rising external competition would tend to induce a
weaker rate, while the surging oil price—and the additional domestic demand it supports—
would induce real appreciation. So far, non-oil exports are still growing, though only
modestly. However, if signs were to emerge suggesting that price competitiveness were
deteriorating excessively, fiscal policy could be called upon to reduce the public sector’s
contribution to demand.

- 30 -

57.
The near-term growth outlook for Mexico will continue to be closely linked to
global and, in particular, U.S. developments, which are expected to remain relatively
favorable. With the passing of the mainly sector-specific factors that led to disappointing
growth in the first half of this year, and barring important surprises in the global
environment, Mexico’s growth is likely to soon return to a moderate pace.
58.
Looking to the medium term, however, lifting Mexico’s growth trend will
depend mainly on the performance of the country’s own economic policies. Mexico’s
external competitiveness faces ongoing challenges, highlighting the need to move ahead with
the pending structural reform agenda and thereby raise trend productivity and growth. As
rising competition from China and other countries continues to gradually displace some
Mexican production, the objective will be to move up the production ladder. As is widely
acknowledged, progress on structural reforms has been disappointing, although there has
been progress in some areas, especially the financial sector. Fortunately, there is by now a
widened understanding of the pending structural reform agenda—including reforms in the
energy and telecommunications sectors, the labor market, judicial system, tax system, and
regulatory and business environments—partly the result of the Fox administration’s efforts to
advance such reforms. Without significant new breakthroughs on this agenda, the likelihood
is that Mexico may achieve only lackluster economic growth.
59.
It is therefore to be hoped that the political system will soon find a way forward
on reforms that so far have met gridlock. Indeed, some analysts, seeing in recent years the
growing pains of still relatively new multi-party democracy, expect that the natural
development of new working relationships and rules of the game will improve prospects for
consensus on new reforms.
60.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Mexico be held on
the standard 12-month cycle.

ANNEX II

MEXICO: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Comprehensive economic data are available for Mexico on a timely basis, and are adequate
to conduct surveillance. Core statistical data are published on a timely basis and are of good
quality (Annex IV). Mexico observes the Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) and
its metadata are posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB). Following a
data ROSC mission to Mexico in February/March 2002, the report was published in June
2003 as IMF Country Report No. 03/150. Its main conclusion was that the overall quality of
Mexican statistics is good. In a number of cases, the periodicity and timeliness of
disseminated data exceeded SDDS requirements However, there are various areas where
improvements could be made. The authorities are aware of this situation and are continuing
work in this regard.
Although some of the balance of payments statistics conform to the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual, a full transition has not yet been completed. International
investment position (IIP) statistics are produced on a yearly basis. Several measures to
improve external debt statistics have been carried out, including the compilation of data on
external liabilities of publicly traded companies registered with the Mexican stock exchange
(external debt outstanding, annual amortization schedule for the next four years broken down
by maturity, and type of instrument), but a projection of the total external debt service of
commercial banks is still not available. International reserves data are compiled according
to the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity: Guidelines
for a Data Template.
A follow-up national accounts mission conducted in May 2005 found that the capture of
non-observed (informal, illegal, and underground) activities is incomplete and that outdated
coefficients from the use matrix of the base year 1993 are extensively used. Technical
assistance might be needed for implementing the work plan proposed by the mission,
covering changing the base year, compiling an input-output table for 2003, and completing
the implementation of the 1993 SNA.
In the fiscal area, the authorities have reported since 2001 a comprehensive measure of the
fiscal balance—the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement—that encompasses the direct net
cost of public investment projects with deferred recording in the fiscal accounts
(PIDIREGAS) as well as the interest cost on a number of government liabilities that had not
been previously recorded. Both the preliminary (available with a 45-day lag following the
end of each quarter) and the final (available mid-year of the subsequent year) data are
published and submitted to congress, ensuring that revisions are transparent and subject to
public scrutiny.

ANNEX III

MEXICO—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
The World Bank Group maintains a substantial program of lending operations, analytical
work and policy dialogue with Mexico. The Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) with
Mexico, as discussed by its Board in April 2004, proposes a selective program of IBRD and
IFC operations and a strategic program of analytical and learning services built upon four
strategic pillars: (1) reduce poverty and inequality; (2) increase competitiveness;
(3) strengthen institutions; and (4) promote environmental sustainability. The CPS envisages
a greater focus on the role that the Bank can play as a knowledge institution, while
continuing to deliver a program of lending operations consistent with Mexico’s development
needs.
Over a four-year period, FY05–FY08, the Bank expects to make more of a difference in
areas where it already maintains productive relationships with government counterparts,
where challenges are multisectoral in nature and where there remain difficult unresolved
matters. It also proposes to be an honest broker among government institutions and civil
society in their efforts to deal with development issues. It will seek a sustained programmatic
analytical engagement in selected areas where the Bank can have the greatest impact, such as
poverty, competitiveness, education quality, decentralization of public finances, and
sustainable water management. Analytical and learning services in these areas will be
supported by lending at the request of the government. In addition, given the importance of
supporting local governments in Mexico’s development strategy, opportunities to increase
lending and non-lending assistance to the states and municipalities will be explored.
As of July 31, 2005, the IBRD exposure in Mexico was US$9.1 billion, representing
8.5 percent of the IBRD’s total portfolio, making Mexico the second largest borrower. The
portfolio under implementation comprises 17 lending operations for US$2.9 billion in
commitments of which US$1.6 billion are still available for disbursements. The Bank also
manages 6 full-size GEF/PCF operations, the largest GEF portfolio in the Bank.
Within the framework of the CPS, a lending program has been agreed that best addresses
Mexico’s development needs (as a creditworthy middle-income country) and allows the
Bank to respond quickly to changing circumstances. A lending range of US$0.8 to
US$1.7 billion a year is available to promote the country’s key development objectives. This
lending range is consistent with careful risk management, in view of the government’s sound
macroeconomic policies and its prudent debt management strategy as well as the projected
evolution of IBRD exposure.
The main focus of IFC’s strategy in Mexico is to support the country’s efforts to improve its
business environment by assisting companies that seek to position themselves better vis-à-vis
local, regional or global competitors. This support will be provided through investment and
advisory assistance and can cover a wide spectrum of firms, from SMEs to 2nd and top tier
companies as well as the public sector. On the latter, the IFC stands ready to provide
reimbursable advisory services to the authorities to complement and support ongoing IBRD
work in this area.

ANNEX V

MEXICO: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS, 2005–2010
1.

Standardized bound tests

Stress tests conducted using the standard IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
framework suggest Mexico’s overall resilience to plausible shocks.
Standardized stress tests, based on the historical volatility of key macroeconomic variables
for the past 10 years, indicate that the level of public debt would not increase substantially
over the medium-term if macro conditions turned out significantly worse than projected. In
the worst cases, involving real GDP growth of 1.2 percent or real interest rates of 8 percent
on average in the next four years, public debt as a share of GDP would still remain in the
48-50 percent range (Figure 1). Importantly, currency depreciation does not pose a serious
risk to the fiscal accounts, which would in fact improve if the peso were to weaken. While
this suggests debt sustainability is not likely to be a concern, a broad range of shocks would
result in a rise in the public sector financing requirement, reflecting the still relatively short
average maturity of the domestic debt. The worst projected case would occur in the event of
an economic stagnation, with annual public sector financing requirements reaching
16½ percent of GDP, compared to about 13 percent in 2005.
Standardized tests also illustrate Mexico’s strong external position. The deterioration of the
growth outlook, or the primary external current account, would have only limited effects on
the trajectory of the country’s external debt and external financing requirements. The most
significant shock would come from a large exchange rate depreciation vis-à-vis the US
dollar, but even in this case, the overall external debt would remain below 30 percent of GDP
by 2010 (Figure 2). This projected increase would also be significantly offset by the
revaluation of net international reserves.
2.

Other stress scenarios

Mexico’s fiscal and external debt position could show greater deterioration under alternative
scenarios involving combined shocks or shocks of greater magnitudes. Staff estimations
indicate that the main challenge would be to provide for a higher liquidity financing need.
One prominent risk scenario would be an inability to adjust fiscal spending as a result of a
sudden permanent decline in oil prices (US$ 40 per barrel for the world average petroleum
price from 2006 onwards, implying less than US$30 per barrel for the Mexican oil mix).
Assuming only limited spending cuts, the primary balance is estimated to deteriorate by
about 1 percent of GDP every year, keeping gross public debt above 45 percent of GDP and
financing requirements around 13 percent of GDP throughout the medium-term. (The actual
fiscal impact would depend importantly on the administered pricing of the domestic energy
provided by state enterprises, including gasoline and electricity: if lower international fuel
prices were transmitted to domestic consumers, then their effect on the fiscal accounts would
be accordingly greater.) On the external side, the main effect would be a reduction in the
pace of reserve accumulation rather than a significant jump in the level of debt or financing
requirements.

- 44 -

ANNEX V

A second prominent risk scenario simply assumes an arbitrary shock to market confidence in
Mexican assets, implying a financial liquidity test, with a rapid deterioration of the exchange
rate, a hike in interest rates, and a return to short-term or interest-rate indexed debt as the
principal means to finance the fiscal deficit and public debt falling due. Using magnitudes
observed in recent crisis episodes (outside Mexico), staff finds that the fiscal deficit would
not show a marked deterioration. However, there would be a substantial rise in short-term
financing requirements, which in principle could be a cause for a further deterioration of
confidence and further financial pressures on the public sector. The external position, on the
other hand, would not deteriorate significantly.
Finally, some basic calculations of the possible effects of a so-called “hard-landing” scenario
in the United States, which would entail sudden economic stagnation, higher domestic
interest rates but some peso appreciation against the dollar, and declining remittances and oil
export prices, confirm the same sources of potential vulnerability, but with a smaller growth
of the public financing requirement than the previous scenario. Still, in this case, the oil and
interest rate shocks would cause a widening of the fiscal deficit (which in turn could
undermine confidence in public debt, if it were not met with clear signs of a fiscal policy
response).

1/ Gross debt of the federal government, social security, nonfinancial enterprises, public development banks, IPAB, FARAC, and direct PIDIREGAS projects.
2/ Includes privatization and other non-recurring revenues.
3/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
4/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
5/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
6/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
7/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
8/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
9/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
November 9, 2005

The following information has become available since the staff report was issued to
Executive Directors. The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged.
1.
Recent indicators suggest that, as expected, economic activity recovered
somewhat in the third quarter, although recent hurricanes could impact growth at the
end of the year. The Bank of Mexico (BoM) now projects growth of 2¾ to 3¼ percent for
2005. The staff projection of 3 percent assumed a pickup in growth in the second half of the
year. The index of overall economic activity rose by 4.5 percent in August over the previous
year, faster than in recent months, while retail sales grew by 4.4 percent in real terms.
September industrial production, on the other hand, showed almost no growth from a year
earlier. Hurricanes Stan and Wilma struck parts of southern Mexico hard, but the BoM
expects that their effect on GDP growth will be small.
2.
Inflation has come down more than expected. Core inflation has continued to
edge down, to 3.2 percent in the first half of October, while headline inflation has declined
markedly, from just under 4 percent in August to 3.5 percent in September and 3.1 percent in
the first half of October (12-month basis). September data show that increases in contractual
wages remain around 4½ percent, as they have for some time. Notwithstanding some risk of
agricultural price shocks from the recent hurricanes, recent developments suggest that
headline inflation at end-2005 is likely to turn out below the staff report’s projection of
3.9 percent. Last week, the Bank of Mexico revised downward its end-2005 inflation
projection, from just under 4 percent to about 3½ percent.
3.
On October 28, the (BoM) announced that it would permit another 25 basis
point easing of monetary conditions; the overnight interbank rate subsequently
declined from 9¼ to 9 percent. This announcement was the third such move since monetary
easing began at end-August, again with no change in the corto. The BoM also announced that
it will shift to monthly, rather than twice monthly, policy meetings, linking this move to the
fact that inflation has become more stable and predictable than in the past.
4.
Third quarter trade data indicate somewhat faster export growth than in the
first half of 2005. The value of total exports in U.S. dollars grew 13½ percent in the third
quarter, compared to 11 percent in the first semester (for non-oil exports, the figures were
9½ percent and 8¼ percent, respectively). The value of imports continued to grow at an
annual rate of about 12 percent, about the same rate as in the first six months of the year.
5.
The 2005 budget dispute was finally resolved, and discussions on the 2006
budget are expected to be completed by November 15. The remaining dispute over parts
of the 2005 budget was resolved in late October, when deputies and the executive reached
agreement on the composition of spending for the year. On the 2006 budget, the house of
deputies has approved a revenue law which would allow budgeted spending to be about

-2-

1 percent of GDP higher than in the government’s proposal, as the deputies: raised the
budget’s oil price assumption from $31.5 to $36.5 per barrel; raised projected non-oil
revenue; and lowered the fiscal balance target from a small surplus to balance (traditional
definition). The changes do not imply a significant revision of the staff report’s projections of
the overall fiscal balance in 2006, and staff continue to expect that the non-oil augmented
balance will be broadly unchanged from 2005.
6.
The Mexican authorities have now officially requested an FSAP update, with
the work to begin early next year.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with
Mexico
On November 9, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Mexico.1
Background
The economic recovery that began in mid-2003 has continued, though at a slower pace in
2005. A broad-based expansion of economic activity in 2004, driven by a rebound of private
consumption and private investment, took growth up to 4.4 percent. The economic recovery
was accompanied by a boost to confidence, capacity utilization, and formal employment. In the
first semester of 2005, growth slowed to 2.8 percent, reflecting several sector-specific
developments, including a soft patch in U.S. industrial production. The most recent indicators
point to a strengthening of activity in the third quarter of this year.
After rising through November 2004, inflation has come down significantly in 2005,
approaching the Bank of Mexico’s 3 percent inflation target. The 12-month headline inflation
rate peaked at 5.4 percent in November 2004, but has declined thereafter, to 3.1 percent in the
first half of October 2005. Core inflation also has come down, to 3.2 percent.
After tightening monetary policy since early 2004, the Bank of Mexico (BoM) signaled an end
to its monetary tightening cycle in June 2005, and began to reverse that tightening in August.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2The firming of monetary conditions in this cycle was substantial—with the overnight interbank
interest rate rising from less than 5 percent in early 2004 to 9 ¾ percent by spring 2005. Since
August, rates have come down to 9 percent, as the BoM has signaled 25 basis point cuts in
the desired floor interest rate, in each of August, September, and October. From early 2004,
the BoM has taken a number of steps to enhance its communication with markets, including
signaling a desired minimum level of interest rates─ yet maintaining the corto instrument (the
borrowed reserves objective).
The fiscal accounts improved in 2004 on the strength of rising oil revenues and restraint of
current expenditures. The authorities achieved their target for the traditional deficit, 0.3 percent
of GDP, and the broadly-defined deficit (the augmented deficit) narrowed to 2 percent of GDP,
from 3.1 percent in 2003. Rising oil revenue helped finance an increase in capital expenditure,
particularly in the oil sector. Gross public debt declined to 46.5 percent of GDP, in part through
the write-off of some of the bank restructuring debt.
In 2005, oil revenues are rising again, but their impact on the broader deficit is being more
than offset by a deterioration in the non-oil fiscal balance. Staff project that the traditional
deficit will narrow slightly, to 0.2 percent of GDP in 2005, while the augmented deficit widens to
2.3 percent of GDP. Oil income for the year is projected to be up by about ½ percentage point
of GDP from 2004 (and about 1 percentage point over budget projections). It is expected that
almost all of this unbudgeted revenue will go to compensate for shortfalls in non-oil revenue,
and toward transfers for additional investment spending by PEMEX and the states, as implied
by the budget law, with a small part going to the oil stabilization fund and reduction of the
traditional budget deficit.
The external current account deficit has remained modest, with a continued rise in oil exports
and household remittances compensating for some widening of the non-oil trade deficit. With
the recovery of economic activity in 2004 and 2005, imports of investment and especially
consumer goods grew strongly, while weak auto exports to the U.S., and enhanced
competition from China and other countries, slowed non-oil exports.
Mexican financial markets have recently performed strongly, as have other emerging markets.
Sovereign bond spreads have continued to decline, recently to less than 150 basis points.
At end-October, the stock market was up more than 75 percent (in domestic currency terms)
since end-2003, with much of that gain coming since April of this year. The peso also has
tended to strengthen this year though giving up some of its gains since August. The BoM has
continued to abstain from market purchases of foreign exchange, but rising foreign exchange
receipts from the state-owned oil company have pushed NIR upward. NIR reached US$61
billion by end 2004, about 4½ months of Mexico’s imports and 1.6 times its short-term external
liabilities; at October 28, 2005, NIR was US$62.3 billion.
The authorities have taken further steps to strengthen the public finances. The average
maturity of the domestic debt of the federal government was extended to 3.1 years by June
2005, up from 2.6 years in early 2004. Exposure to currency depreciation has declined further
as the public sector’s annual foreign exchange earnings from oil now exceed US$30 billion,
against interest payments on its foreign debt of US$9 billion. Furthermore, at mid-year the
authorities announced that the federal government had accumulated enough foreign currency
liquidity to allow it to forego any external bond issues through 2007.

-3Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Mexican authorities for the improvements they had made
in economic policies, institutions and structures over the last decade, which have contributed
to greater macroeconomic stability and reduced financial vulnerability. Fiscal policy has earned
broad credibility, with a track record of achieving the annual deficit targets, and a prudent
monetary policy has established a low-inflation environment. A series of reforms has
strengthened the financial sector and boosted its development. Directors welcomed that
economic policy making is taking place in a setting of greater inclusiveness and transparency
in government. The challenge ahead will be to launch a new round of structural reforms that
will enhance the economy’s efficiency and competitiveness and ensure the transition to a more
rapid growth path, while entrenching the considerable progress that has already been made in
economic policy design and implementation.
Concerning fiscal policy, Directors commended the authorities for achieving declining annual
targets for the fiscal deficit, reducing the public debt ratio, and improving the debt structure,
and they encouraged them to continue their efforts. At the same time, Directors noted that the
overall fiscal balance has been benefiting increasingly from rising world oil prices, and that a
reversal of oil prices could complicate fiscal policy if expenditures could not be reduced
quickly. Most Directors urged the authorities to avoid a further widening of the non-oil fiscal
deficit in 2006. A few Directors recommended monitoring closely the increase in spending by
the state governments.
Directors supported Mexico’s intention to implement a medium-term budget framework, with
the objectives of reducing public debt further, strengthening the public finances, limiting
vulnerability to oil revenue fluctuations, and allocating resources efficiently to essential
investments, especially in the oil and social sectors. Noting the important share of oil revenues
in total government revenues, Directors also encouraged the authorities to take measures over
the medium term to strengthen the tax system and broaden its base, including by bringing
more of the economy into the formal sector. Directors considered that the current high oil
prices make it more important than ever to ensure that the operations and investments of the
state-owned oil company (PEMEX) are effective.
Directors agreed that the monetary tightening of 2004 and early 2005 had been necessary to
contain the rise in inflation and reverse inflation expectations. They were reassured that
headline and core inflation are now close to the 3 percent target. With inflation expectations
also moving down in recent months, the improved inflation outlook has allowed the Bank of
Mexico to begin gradually loosening its policy stance. Directors recommended that the Bank
continue to proceed cautiously in this direction, noting that inflation expectations have not yet
converged to the 3 percent inflation target.
Directors welcomed the changes in the operational framework of monetary policy since
early 2004. The Bank of Mexico’s steps to refocus and sharpen its policy statements, provide
an indication of its estimate of inflation for the current year, and shift toward defining policy
changes through signalling a minimum level of interest rates have enhanced communication
and the market’s understanding of monetary policy objectives. Some Directors suggested that
the authorities make public inflation forecasts for both the current year and a somewhat longer
horizon, and adopt fully and explicitly an interest rate policy instrument.

-4Directors considered that Mexico has been well served by its floating exchange rate regime.
External competitiveness appears to be broadly adequate at present, as reflected in the
sustainable balance of payments position.
Directors welcomed the considerable progress made in strengthening and reforming the
financial sector and capital markets and reducing potential vulnerabilities, setting the stage for
an environment conducive to economic growth. Commercial banks appear to be well
capitalized, profitable, and provisioned against nonperforming loans. Directors were
encouraged that bank credit has begun to expand after a long period of stagnation. They noted
the efforts to further enhance financial sector supervision.
Directors expressed disappointment with the slow pace of structural reforms in recent years in
spite of the authorities’ commitment to move forward in this area. At the same time, they
supported the authorities’ emphasis on implementing small-scale reforms to improve structural
competitiveness in specific sectors. Nevertheless, Directors emphasized that to confront
Mexico’s external competitiveness, productivity, and growth challenges effectively in the future,
more thoroughgoing structural reforms will be indispensable, including in the energy and
telecommunications sectors, the labor market, the judicial system, the tax system, and the
regulatory and business environment. In that light, Directors were encouraged that there is a
growing popular understanding of the need to implement an ambitious structural reform
agenda. They advised the authorities to continue to stand ready to move ahead quickly to
implement these reforms at the appropriate juncture.

Statement by Moises Schwartz, Executive Director for Mexico
November 9, 2005

Supported by prudent fiscal and monetary policies and by a sound financial system, the
Mexican economy has continued along its path of stability. Growth has recovered, inflation
is within the variability range of the target and the medium-term outlook is favorable. Given
the close integration with the US economy, the slowdown observed in the latter during the
first half of the year resulted in a transitory deceleration of the Mexican economy in the same
period. Notwithstanding, the economy has managed to continue growing during 13
consecutive quarters and recovery is well underway, with private consumption and
investment as the main contributors to growth. Economic activity has fostered employment,
which, in turn, has continued to strengthen domestic demand. The outlook is favorable and it
is expected that industrial production will increase its pace with an important expansion in
2006.
Fiscal Policy
My authorities are convinced on the contribution that public finances consolidation can add
to growth, basically through the reduction of the debt’s financial cost, increasing the
availability of resources that can be oriented to social expenditure or investment; and the
support that economic stability provides to financial markets and, hence, to private sector
activity. As it has been the case during the current administration, fiscal targets have been
met, even when no additional oil-related resources were present. During the current
administration, the traditional balance has been reduced from 1.1 percent of GDP in 2000 to
an expected 0.2 percent of GDP in 2005 and to an equilibrium or even a surplus in 2006,
while the augmented deficit (broadly defined) will decrease from 3.7 percent of GDP to 2.4
percent in 2005 and to 1.5 percent in 2006. As the fiscal consolidation process advances, the
public sector internal absorption of resources (public sector borrowing requirements as a
share of domestic financial savings) has decreased, from 66 percent in 2000 to an estimated
14 percent in 2005, liberating resources and actually creating a “crowding-in” effect in the
financial system.
My authorities are pursuing an adequate mix of external and domestic debt, reducing the
weight of external liabilities. As a result, the fiscal deficit is totally financed by domestic debt
while external debt reduction has been carried out. It is expected that the net external debt
will be equivalent to 6.8 percent of GDP at end 2006, the lowest in the country’s recent
economic history. Moreover, currently the government has at its disposal the foreign
exchange necessary to meet all 2006 and 2007 external debt payments. It is expected that the
average net financing cost of the federal government will be near 2.5 percent of GDP for the
period 2001-2006, 0.8 percentage points lower than the one observed during the previous
administration. At the same time, the average maturity of domestic debt has increased from
291 days in 1993, to 539 in 2000, to 1,161 in September 2005, while the amortization profile
is now comfortable. In addition, 37 percent of total debt is currently short term, compared to
65 percent in 2001.

-2Public finances have been supported by high oil prices, which have resulted in higher than
budgeted oil income. Nonetheless, oil income has been managed in a prudent and transparent
way. Excess resources are distributed according to a previously-determined formula that
allocates them to investment in the oil sector, infrastructure projects in the states, to improve
the public balance and to the oil stabilization fund. My authorities understand the potential
benefit of allocating a higher share of excess revenue to saving, but they also recognize that
Mexico has an important lag in infrastructure that merits to be addressed in order to equip the
economy for continuous and sustained growth in the future. As it has been acknowledged,
there is also an important need for oil producing countries to assign resources for investment
in the energy sector. The availability of additional resources has allowed for higher
expenditure where there have been historical lags. Well-designed social programs and
productive infrastructure investment have received priority. Nonetheless, a conservative
budgeting approach and the existence of formulas and mechanisms to allocate excess
resources have resulted in an orderly and responsible process.
Although future oil prices indicate some persistence at high levels, my authorities
acknowledge that these are not permanent. In this sense, a prudent approach is called for.
This is one of the reasons why a conservative budget including a 0.2 percent of GDP surplus
has been presented for 2006. In addition, an initiative to reform the Budget Process,
including a Fiscal Responsibility Law, has been submitted to Congress. Salient features
include rules to set the oil price in the budget, the oil stabilization fund and other important
considerations that are still negotiated on a yearly basis.
Monetary Policy and the Financial System
Improvement in monetary policy has come a long way. Thanks to a significant consolidation
in public finances, monetary policy has been focused on the fight against inflation. The
central bank is autonomous since 1994 and in 1999 it began a gradual transition towards an
inflation target regime, by announcing a target for the medium term. In 2000 the central bank
began the publication of inflation reports and the concept of core inflation was introduced. A
formal inflation targeting framework was adopted in 2001, while in 2002 the long-term target
of 3 percent, including a variability range of +- 1 percentage point, was announced. Since
2003 monetary policy announcements take place on previously scheduled dates.
Macroeconomic stability and fiscal discipline have promoted financial deepening, thus been
paramount in fostering financial savings. From 2000 to 2005 domestic financial savings
increased from 42.4 percent of GDP to 51.0 percent. The increase in savings allowed to
increase the financing to the private sector from 17.9 percent of GDP in 2000, to 22.7 percent
in March 2005. In addition, between 2001 and 2004 more than 20 initiatives oriented to
develop the financial system and improve its efficiency were approved. Improvements to the
legal framework and restructuring process have led to a well capitalized and adequately
supervised banking system. These measures have allowed a healthy increase in bank and
non-bank credit. The authorities are well aware of the risks that such increase could pose and
hence have committed to follow developments closely. It should be noted, however, that
balance sheets are in their best position in years and that credit is starting from a low base.
Looking forward, the authorities are working closely with Congress on an initiative for a new

-3Securities Market Law, which would allow for new corporate figures and improve the legal
framework for companies in the stock market.
My authorities value the Fund’s advice and consider that they should continue their efforts to
ensure that the financial system is consolidated as a sustainable element of support for
economic growth. In this sense, they have requested the Bank and the Fund to undertake a
FSAP update that could not only help assess the impact of reforms already implemented, but
that would also provide valuable information on additional opportunities for enhancing the
efficiency of the financial sector.
Structural reforms
Notwithstanding the proximity of political times, my authorities will focus on reaching
consensus to approve structural reforms and further consolidate macroeconomic stability.
The authorities acknowledge that structural reforms are the mechanism through which
productivity can receive a sustained impulse, and that countries that have achieved sustained
growth are those that have engaged in reforms in the financial, labor and fiscal areas and that
have reduced regulation in the economy, as well as fought monopolies and opened up to
competition in sectors as energy and telecommunications. Reaching consensus is a difficult
but rewarding exercise, and they are committed to expedite this process.
