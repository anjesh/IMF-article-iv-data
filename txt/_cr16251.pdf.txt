IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with the
United Arab Emirates
On July 20, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with the United Arab Emirates.
Persistently lower oil prices continue to weigh on economic sentiment and fiscal and external
positions, but large buffers built over time have provided ample policy space, limited negative
inward spillovers and contained the weakening of investor appetite.
Non-oil economic activity has slowed to 3.7 percent in 2015 driven by a contraction of public
investment in the context of fiscal consolidation, and lower contribution from domestic private
demand. Negative effects on overall growth were partially offset by the increase in oil
production. Despite the strong fiscal policy response to adjust to lower oil prices, the fiscal
balance turned to a deficit of 2.1 percent of GDP, while the current account surplus declined to
3.3 percent of GDP. Banks remained well capitalized and liquid, though pressures on
profitability are emerging as asset quality weakens due to the economic slowdown and rising
funding costs.
Economic activity is expected to moderate further in 2016, before improving over the medium
term. Nonhydrocarbon growth is projected to slow to 2.4 percent in 2016 due to fiscal
consolidation, the stronger dollar, and tighter monetary and financial conditions. Over the
medium-term, nonhydrocarbon growth is forecast to increase to above 4 percent as the
dampening effect of fiscal consolidation is offset by improvements in economic sentiment and
financial conditions as oil prices rise, a pickup in private investment in the run-up to the Expo
2020, and stronger external demand.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the United Arab Emirates’ resilience to the oil price shock.
Directors commended the authorities for their prudent policies, which helped build large fiscal

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

and external buffers and strengthened the economy. Nevertheless, persistent lower oil prices
continue to pose challenges. Directors underscored the need for sustained sound macroeconomic
policies to reduce fiscal vulnerabilities, safeguard financial stability, and promote long-term
growth.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to pursue fiscal consolidation. For the near
term, in light of the ample buffers, they generally considered a gradual adjustment effort to be
appropriate in order to minimize the negative impact on growth. However, stronger fiscal
consolidation will be needed over the medium term to ensure intergenerational equity.
Directors encouraged the authorities to diversify revenues and rationalize current spending, while
further strengthening public financial management. They welcomed the plans to introduce a
VAT and increase excise taxes, which could be followed by a corporate income tax. Directors
also recommended phasing out remaining energy subsidies, while protecting the vulnerable.
Priority should also be given to curb other current spending, while preserving public investment
and enhancing its efficiency. Directors noted that developing a consolidated forward-looking
medium-term fiscal framework would assist the authorities in setting direction for fiscal policy,
and in aligning resource allocation with the UAE 2021 vision. They encouraged the authorities to
strengthen the debt management framework to better account for contingent liabilities from
Government Related Entities and Public-Private Partnerships.
Directors noted that the peg remains an appropriate anchor for price and financial stability. They
supported continued efforts to enhance the monetary framework, particularly by improving
liquidity management. Directors encouraged further steps to develop domestic debt markets and
reduce private sector foreign exchange exposure. They also encouraged the authorities to tap into
sovereign wealth funds and international capital markets to finance the deficit.
Directors welcomed the ongoing revision of the central bank and banking law and plans to
strengthen banking regulation and supervision. They emphasized that the new law should further
enhance central bank independence and governance, align the macroprudential institutional
framework with best practices, upgrade banking sector regulation and supervision in line with
global standards, strengthen safety nets, and improve the resolution framework. Directors
encouraged the authorities to implement their plans to phase in the Basel III capital framework,
enforce loan concentration limits, strengthen corporate governance, and move toward risk-based
supervision. They supported ongoing efforts to strengthen the AML/CFT framework and address
de-risking.
Directors commended the efforts to further diversify the economy away from oil. They
encouraged continued action to increase productivity and foster competitiveness. Efforts should
continue to improve the business environment, ease restrictions on FDI in the new investment
law, and spur competition. In addition, priority should be given to upgrading the quality of
education, promoting innovation and entrepreneurship, and facilitating SMEs’ and startups’
access to finance, notably through an approval of the bankruptcy law and further broadening the
credit bureau’s coverage.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 5, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context. Sustained low oil prices have led to a weakening of fiscal and external
positions, tightening of monetary and financial conditions, and somewhat softer
economic sentiment. Substantial fiscal consolidation was achieved in 2015, but it has
weighed on non-oil growth and banks’ asset quality.
Outlook and risks. Non-oil growth is expected to slow further in 2016, before
improving over the medium term as oil prices recover and investment picks up in the
run-up to the Expo2020. Macro-financial risks have increased, though the UAE’s large
buffers and safe-haven status have helped to limit negative inward spillovers.
Fiscal policy. Authorities’ plans to pursue consolidation are welcome and should be
supplemented by additional measures to diversify revenues and phase out subsidies
over the medium-term, supported by further strengthening of public financial
management. In the near-term, and given the headwinds from lower oil prices, the pace
of consolidation should be eased to reduce its growth impact. In addition, the deficit
financing strategy should avoid tightening banking system liquidity and crowding out
credit to the private sector.
Financial stability. The banking system is resilient and has sufficient capital and liquidity
buffers to withstand adverse shocks. However, pressures on liquidity, asset quality, and
profitability are emerging and call for further strengthening prudential frameworks. The
ongoing revision of the central bank and banking law is an opportunity to develop a
fully-fledged macroprudential framework, further strengthen supervision, and beef up
safety nets and the resolution framework. Also, efforts to strengthen the AML/CFT
framework and address de-risking should continue.
Economic diversification. Structural reforms aimed at raising productivity, improving
competitiveness and further diversifying the economy should be pursued. Focus should
be on improving business environment, relaxing constraints on foreign ownership,
fostering competition, upgrading the quality of education, promoting innovation and
entrepreneurship, and easing SMEs’ and startups’ access to finance.

BACKGROUND
1.
The UAE is facing lower oil prices from a position of strength, but macro-financial
stability risks have increased and financial conditions have tightened. Fiscal prudence,
progress in economic diversification and safe-haven status have helped build large fiscal and
external buffers and strengthen the resilience of the economy. However, the sharp fall in oil
prices and revenues, followed by sizable fiscal consolidation and, to a lesser extent, the
appreciation of the real effective exchange rate have dampened non-oil growth and increased
credit risk. The deficit financing in 2015 has contributed to liquidity pressures and tightening of
monetary and financial conditions, which could be an additional drag on economic activity. The
strong external balance sheet has so far helped to limit negative inward spillovers and to
maintain robust risk appetite.

Against this backdrop, the authorities have been implementing a number of
reforms to strengthen macro-financial stability and pursue economic diversification. They
have made a number of advances in implementing the 2015 Article IV policy recommendations,
among them resuming fiscal consolidation, developing a full-fledged macroprudential
framework, phasing in Basel III capital and liquidity requirements, strengthening GREs’ balance
sheets, and enhancing SMEs’ access to finance. (Table 1)

RECENT MACRO-FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Non-oil economic activity has slowed. Amid lower oil prices non-hydrocarbon growth
slowed to 3.7 percent in 2015, and declining PMI points also to continued softening of activity in
the first months of 2016 (see Figures 1 and 2). The slowdown in 2015 was driven by a contraction
of public investment in the context of fiscal consolidation, and lower contribution from domestic
private demand as business and consumer confidence weakened and credit to the private sector
slowed. The impact on overall growth was partially offset by an increase in oil production.
Inflation has eased to 1.4 percent year-over-year by end-March 2016.
4.
The fiscal stance was contractionary in 2015 (Figure 3). With frontloaded fiscal
consolidation in Abu Dhabi, the adjusted non-hydrocarbon deficit is estimated to have narrowed
by 8½ percentage points to 29 percent of non-hydrocarbon GDP in 2015, leading to a reduction
in the fiscal break-even oil price to about $60 in 2015 from $79 in 2014. In terms of its
composition, the authorities scaled back capital transfers to GREs, cut government investment,
raised electricity and water tariffs, and removed fuel subsidies.1 Despite these measures, the
overall fiscal balance turned to a deficit of 2.1 percent of GDP due to lower oil prices. The deficit
was mainly financed by drawing down government deposits.
5.
The current account surplus declined sharply in 2015 to 3.3 percent of GDP from
10 percent in 2014, due to lower oil and gas prices (Figure 5). Nonhydrocarbon exports remained
resilient. The tourism sector continued to expand in 2015, but at a slower pace. Foreign direct
investment remained steady and net foreign inflows increased significantly, driven by banks’
foreign borrowing. As a result, the overall external balance improved and gross international
reserves at the CBU increased to USD 94 billion in 2015 from 78.5 billion in 2014. The REER
appreciated by 9.5 percent in 2015, due mainly to the stronger U.S. dollar, to which the Dirham is
pegged, and higher relative price inflation in the UAE, before edging down 1.5 percent year-todate by end-March 2016. Due to its large external buffers, pressures on the peg were limited with
the 3-month forward implied yield at 0.78 bps on April 29, the lowest in the GCC region.
6.
Banks remained well capitalized, but profitability pressures have emerged. Domestic
deposit growth has slowed significantly to 1.8 percent y-o-y at end–March 2016, reflecting lower
government deposits. This has led to increased wholesale foreign funding (up to 11.8 percent of
banks’ liabilities by end–March 2016 from a 10.4 percent a year ago, mostly dollar-denominated
and with an average maturity of about 2.6 years) to finance slowing but still robust domestic
credit growth at 7.6 percent y-o-y at end-March 2016. Lending standards have tightened, though
to a lesser extent in the first quarter of 2016 (Figures 1 and 4). Nevertheless, banking liquidity is
still comfortable with an overall liquid asset ratio of 20.7 percent by end-March 2016. Banks
remained well capitalized, though NPLs rose slightly to 5.3 percent by end-March, notably for
SMEs, while NPL coverage by provisions remains at 108 percent. With slower deposit growth

than loan growth and with the U.S. interest rate hike in December, interbank rates increased in
2015, and higher costs of funding and weaker asset quality could weigh on profitability in 2016.
Overall, financial risks in the banking sector were still moderate at the end of the first quarter of
2016 as banks’ balance sheets remained strong and the credit to non-oil GDP gap is estimated to
have remained negative (see Figure 1 FSI heat map).
7.
Real estate prices have continued to decline, but the quality of the real estate loan
portfolio has remained resilient. Structural measures taken in 2014, such as the tightening of
industry self-regulation, higher real estate fees, and tighter macroprudential regulation for
mortgage lending, have helped contain speculative demand for real estate and led to declining
prices. This trend has continued with Dubai’s real estate average residential prices falling by
11 percent in 2015, also reflecting oversupply and strong headwinds on demand. In Abu Dhabi
where the supply growth slowed, they fell by 0.8 percent. However, these developments do not
appear to pose systemic risks for the financial sector, as the nonperforming loans for
construction and real estate development declined from 12.3 percent in 2013 to 7.5 percent by
end-March 2016. Similar improvements have been experienced for loans to households with
NPLs ratio down from 10 to 4.9 percent over the same period.
8.
GREs have continued to deleverage. Several GREs actively managed their debt, making
early repayments and lengthening maturity profiles. Nonetheless, the GREs debt servicing
capacity remains limited with an average interest coverage ratio (ICR) of 2 as of end-June 2015.
In addition, total public debt in Dubai continued to be significant at 126.2 percent of Dubai GDP
in 2015, large maturities are due by 2018, and net debt of GREs with an ICR lower than 1.5 was
estimated at about U.S. $20 billion at end-June 2015. In Abu Dhabi, GREs have substantially
reduced their debt.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
9.
Economic activity is expected to further moderate in 2016, before improving over
the medium term. Nonhydrocarbon growth is projected to further slow to 2.4 percent in 2016
due to fiscal consolidation, a stronger dollar, and tighter monetary and financial conditions with
credit growth falling to 5 percent. Over the medium term, nonhydrocarbon growth is forecast to
recover to above 4 percent as the dampening effect of fiscal consolidation is offset by: (i) the
expected improvement in oil prices and its positive effects on confidence and financial
conditions; (ii) the pickup in private investment in the run-up to the Expo 2020 supported by
robust private sector credit growth; and (iii) increased demand from Iran after the easing of
sanctions.2 Growth in hydrocarbon production will likely be limited, given the global supply glut.
Inflation is projected to decline to 3.3 percent in 2016. The fiscal deficit is expected to widen and
the current account surplus to decline in 2016, owing to lower oil prices, before improving over
the medium term. Credit to non-oil GDP gap is forecast to remain negative over the mediumterm, and credit to non-oil GDP to remain stable at 143.5 percent (Tables 2-5).

2

The easing of Iran sanctions was estimated to add 1 percentage point to real GDP growth over 2016-18 (See
Box 2, 2015 Article IV staff report). However, the significant positive impact might be delayed beyond 2016, as
financial institutions’ reengagement with Iran remains slow and so far trade does not appear to have picked up
appreciably.

Risks are tilted to the downside. (See Risk Assessment Matrix).



External risks. The main external risk is a further sustained drop in oil prices, with export and
fiscal revenue losses remaining the most significant transmission channels. The effects would
be exacerbated by falling liquidity in the banking system from further draw-downs of
government deposits, and rising NPLs due to weaker activity on account of fiscal
retrenchment. Weaker asset quality could also have negative effects on credit and non-oil
GDP growth. Moreover, lower oil prices would continue to exacerbate volatility in the stock
markets and have a negative effect on real estate prices. Higher U.S. interest rates and
volatile global financial conditions could also trigger rollover risks for banks and GREs,
intensify liquidity strains and further weaken business and consumer confidence, and
additional appreciation of the dollar would weigh on competitiveness and external demand.
Slowdowns in other GCC countries could spill over through trade, tourism and asset prices,
while increased issuance to finance deficits in these countries could put pressures on liquidity
and cost of funding. Also, as an important partner in terms of inward FDI and tourism, a
deterioration of the economic outlook in the UK or a large sustained depreciation of the
pound following its decision to leave the EU, would have negative impact on the UAE
economy, which could be compounded by possible negative spillovers from the EU and
downward pressures on oil prices. By contrast, possible rebalancing of oil markets or
geopolitical tensions could raise global energy prices and support UAE’s fiscal and external
positions. While the authorities broadly agreed on these risks and proposed policy responses,
they pointed to other upside risks such as increased tourism and foreign investment due to
the country’s safe-haven status.



Domestic risks. Dubai megaprojects, if not implemented prudently, may create additional
macro-financial risks to GREs and banks, and ultimately to the fiscal position in light of the
debt overhang from the 2008/9 global financial crisis. Authorities agreed and reiterated their
commitment to continue strengthening the GREs’ balance sheets.

The. Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the
view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a
probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The
RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually
exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly. “Short term” and “medium term” are meant to indicate that the risk could materialize within
1 year and 3 years, respectively. Colored boxes represent severity of impact. Red = High, Yellow =Medium, and Green = Low to Positive.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Strengthening Macroeconomic Stability
11.
Gradual fiscal consolidation is key to reduce fiscal vulnerability and strengthen fiscal
sustainability while cushioning its impact on growth. In the absence of further fiscal adjustment
(beyond that already undertaken in 2015), the fiscal break-even oil price will remain above projected
market prices over the medium term. Also calculations, based on the permanent income hypothesis
(PIH), suggest that the 2015 non-hydrocarbon primary deficit exceeds the level consistent with a
constant real per capita annuity that would ensure intergenerational equity, the gap being about
7.6 percent of non-oil GDP (Appendix I). These vulnerabilities call for additional fiscal consolidation
over the medium term. However, considering large buffers, fiscal adjustment should be gradual to
minimize its negative impact on growth.
12.
Authorities plan to pursue fiscal consolidation. The baseline scenario, based on
authorities’ plans, forecasts a further narrowing of the nonhydrocarbon fiscal deficit by 8.6 percent
of nonhydrocarbon GDP by 2021 (relative to the 2015 level) and a balanced overall budget by 2018.
Planned fiscal measures are: (i) the implementation of VAT from 2018 onwards at a low rate of
5 percent; (ii) an increase of excise taxes on tobacco and alcohol, and their introduction on soft
drinks starting from 2018; (iii) continued improvements in fees structure and collection, (iv)
continued scaling back of grants and capital transfers to GREs; and (v) stabilization of the public
wage bill as a share of non-oil GDP and of other expenses in real terms. Staff supports authorities’
measures to curb current spending and diversify non-oil revenues. For 2016, approved budgets at
the Federal and Dubai levels point to a slight fiscal consolidation of 0.1 percent of non-oil GDP. Abu
Dhabi’s budget has yet to be approved, but preliminary indications point to a sharp consolidation of
about 2.9 percent of non-oil GDP.
13.
While pursuing fiscal consolidation is appropriate, its pace should be more gradual,
involving less consolidation in the near-term together with an acceleration beyond current
plans over the medium-term. Considering the large buffers and potential headwinds to non-oil
growth from external and financial conditions in 2016, it is important not to withdraw support from
public demand too sharply, and therefore to lower the pace of consolidation, notably in Abu Dhabi,
by raising capital spending while improving its efficiency. Over the medium term as the outlook
improves, the pace of consolidation could be slightly accelerated with the objective to achieve an
additional consolidation compared to the baseline of 2.1 percent of non-hydrocarbon, mostly backloaded, that further reduces the gap to the level of nonhydrocarbon deficit that is consistent with
intergenerational equity over the medium term. Suggested measures, which are aimed at increasing
spending efficiency and diversifying non-oil revenues, include: (i) gradually phasing out electricity,
water and gas subsidies, while protecting the lower-tier consumers; and (ii) introducing corporate
income tax over the medium term, with a low rate of 10 percent (See below an illustrative estimation
of measures). The authorities favor a more frontloaded fiscal consolidation as uncertainty on oil
prices remains high. In terms of composition, while they agree on phasing out remaining subsidies

12

over the medium term, they plan to wait for the completion of an impact study of corporate income
tax before deciding its timeline, base and rate.

14.
The longstanding exchange rate peg has served the UAE well and should be
maintained. The peg anchored prices of tradables and thus inflation, and provided stability to
income flows and financial wealth. Therefore, given the large external buffers, maintaining the peg
remains appropriate. However, with the continued appreciation of the real effective exchange rate
while terms of trade have deteriorated, the external position is moderately weaker than the level
consistent with medium-term fundamentals, as illustrated by the estimated current account gap
(Appendix III). To close this gap, the authorities agreed with staff that further fiscal adjustment, as
recommended above, is needed. In addition, it is important to further strengthen the policy
framework, through enhancing liquidity forecasting and management, further developing money
and debt markets, and reducing foreign exchange exposure of banks and the corporate sector.
15.
Deficit financing should remain supportive of private sector credit growth. Cumulative
fiscal deficits are forecast at U.S $18.4 billion over 2016-21, which is small compared to the UAE’s
estimated fiscal buffers. To avoid crowding out the private sector, the authorities agree with staff
that deficit financing should tap into sovereign wealth funds or international capital markets, instead
of drawing down government deposits or incurring payment arrears. The recent Eurobond issuance
by Abu Dhabi of $5 billion is welcome; further external bond issuance should be pursued. Increased
domestic sovereign issuance, including by Abu Dhabi, would help deepen the domestic debt market,
and provide the local and federal governments with a new funding source, and banks with a new
instrument to manage liquidity, including by substituting part of the existing stock of CBU
certificates of deposits (about $31.4 billion by end-March), which can be facilitated by lowering the
volume of CDs and their average maturity. To allow issuance at the federal level, including of Sukuk
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES

which are also essential to help Islamic banks better manage their liquidity, the authorities should
approve the Public Debt Law and the Trust law. The Central Bank (CBU) should use its instruments as
needed to support healthy liquidity, and avoid unwarranted tightening of monetary conditions.
16.
Fiscal policy should be supported by a stronger public financial management
framework. Building on substantial progress already made on fiscal coordination and reporting, the
authorities should develop a consolidated forward-looking medium-term fiscal framework to help
set the direction for fiscal policy in the UAE as a whole and better align aggregate resource
allocation with the 2021 vision. In that regard, the fiscal framework developed at the Federal level
could be a good benchmark for the local level, while the plans to introduce a five-year federal fiscal
framework and to consolidate medium-term budgets for education and healthcare are welcome.
Abu Dhabi needs to adopt a multiyear performance-based budgeting framework, which has been
prepared, to provide further clarity on its fiscal strategy and to strengthen its annual budget process,
notably by approving budgets ahead of the fiscal year. Strong Public Finance Management systems
at the local level should be in place to increase budget credibility and comprehensiveness, including
by avoiding earmarking of revenues and firmly controlling expenditures. The authorities broadly
concurred with staff’s view and indicated that further work is ongoing to strengthen fiscal
coordination and generalize accrual accounting.
17.
Public debt management frameworks should also be further strengthened. Gross public
debt-to-GDP is projected to pick up to 17.0 percent in 2017, before decreasing over the medium
term. However, this ratio could double in a severe stress scenario with lower oil prices and higher
default rate of GREs. Furthermore, staff analysis has shown that GREs’ leverage increased in the past
with weaker fiscal position and lower interest rates (see Appendix IV), and eventually necessitated
large bailouts from local governments. Therefore, in this context of lower transfers to GREs and
planned megaprojects, it is important to strengthen debt management frameworks to properly
account for contingent liabilities from GREs as well as other Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs). This
is particularly the case for Dubai, which needs to develop contingency plans in case a severe stress
scenario materializes (Annex II). In this regard, recent efforts by the Dubai’s supreme fiscal council
and by Abu Dhabi’s debt management office to closely review GREs’ debt issuances are welcome
and should be pursued, as envisaged by the authorities.
Safeguarding Financial Stability
18.
Sustained lower oil prices and non-oil growth, and strong interconnectedness with
GREs pose risks to the banking system. Lower oil prices have put pressures on banks’ liquidity
and profitability, due to declining government deposits, lower net interest margins and, possibly,
deterioration of asset quality. Preliminary results of a bottom-up default analysis from an additional
$10 decline in oil prices, suggest that the corporate sector probabilities of default would increase to
the highest levels since 2009, which would lead to further deterioration in the asset quality of the
banking system (see Appendix V). In the case of a more severe scenario, with a sharp contraction in
non-oil GDP and fall in real estate prices, the CBU’s credit risk stress test indicates that the capital
adequacy ratios of five small to medium sized banks out of 22 banks would fall below the current
12 percent capital requirement by 2018 (see Box 1). Banking liquidity is also expected to remain
14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

comfortable, with the liquidity risk stress test indicating the banking system would have enough
high-quality liquid assets to meet obligations for a 30-day period under a stress scenario. In
addition, buffers in the banking system appear to be determined by both bank-specific and macro
factors, including oil prices. As envisaged, the central bank should encourage banks identified in the
stress tests to strengthen their capital and liquidity positions.
19.
The new central bank and banking law should be swiftly approved and implemented
to help strengthen, in particular, the macroprudential framework. Authorities and staff agree
that the new law should: (i) further enhance central bank independence and governance; (ii) align
the macroprudential institutional framework with best practices, including by giving the central bank
the responsibility of supervising all systemically important financial institutions; (iii) enhance
regulation and supervision of the banking sector in line with global standards, notably the Basel core
principles for effective supervision; (iv) strengthen safety nets; and (v) improve the resolution
framework. The implementation of the law will help develop a proper macroprudential framework
with the central bank coordinating the Financial Stability Committee. This needs to be accompanied
by strengthening the central bank’s institutional capacity and its macroprudential tools. In this
regard and to avoid a build-up of systemic liquidity risks, the lending to stable resources ratio
should not be relaxed, and LCR and NSFR should be implemented as planned, both in foreign and
domestic currencies as the existing regulation appropriately requires that liquid assets be held in the
currency of the net outflows. Also, as systemic risks for the financial sector from declining real estate
prices remain contained, there is no need to ease the corresponding macroprudential measures
(loan-to-value and debt service-to-income). In addition, better monitoring of real estate markets
and mortgage lending is needed to continue to appropriately calibrate these measures and contain
related macro-financial risks.

2017, and 5.3 percent in 2018. This scenario implies a total
increase in PDs by 3.8 times at end-2018.
Few medium and small banks would be adversely affected as a result of higher NPL ratios in 2015. The
average CAR would decline from 17.8 percent to 15.7 percent under the downturn scenario. However, the capital of
two small and three medium banks would be below the 12 percent minimum CAR, with a capital shortfall of AED
7.3 billion (0.4 percent of 2018 GDP). However, the CARs could still be further adversely affected by risks arising
from single-name concentrations, second-round effects, and higher LGD than observed during major debt GRE and
corporate restructurings following the 2008–09 crisis. Further capital injection is needed to strengthen the resilience
of the five banks.
Liquidity Risk Stress Testing
The CBU also conducted a liquidity stress test based on the
Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) methodology.1 The LCR stress
test included a baseline and an adverse scenario with additional
5-10 percent haircut on high-quality liquid assets on average
and an additional 5 percent run-off rate on stable deposits on
top of the LCR assumptions under the baseline scenario. Data
were of end-March 2016.

slightly below the minimum 100 percent LCR under both the
baseline and adverse LCR scenarios. The low impact of the
adverse scenario reflects the new liquidity regulation that has required banks to hold at least 10 percent of their
total liabilities in eligible liquid assets (central bank certificate of deposits, reserve requirements, and domestic and
foreign government securities with zero-risk weight). The phase-in introduction of the LCR provides banks with a
gradual schedule to adjust to the 100 percent requirement by 2019.

CBU’s plans to strengthen regulatory and supervisory frameworks are welcome and
should be timely implemented. The central bank action to ensure that credit risks are well
provisioned before any distribution of 2015 banks’ profits is welcome, has contributed to
strengthening capital buffers, and should be continued. The central bank has also prepared a draft
regulation to phase in Basel III capital standards and should pursue it as planned while continuing to
ensure that new additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 issuances are in line with Basel III requirements. To
mitigate systemic risk from high concentration in the banking system, the new capital framework
should also include capital charges for systemically important banks. Broad-based measures, such as
counter-cyclical capital buffers and dynamic provisioning, should also be introduced to help reduce
the pro-cyclicality of bank lending. Setting up limits to banks’ open FX positions, especially in other
foreign currencies than the US dollar, would also contain market risks and FX exposure of banks.
Loan concentration limits for GREs and local governments should be strictly enforced. CBU’s plans to
strengthen banks’ corporate governance should be timely implemented, notably to strengthen risk
management and to address potential conflicts of interest from related-party lending, especially
with GREs. Also, significant progress has been made in risk-based supervision by developing
dashboards of risks by bank and should be accompanied by better risk-based allocation of
supervisory resources. The recent approval of a centralized Shari’ah Board is also a step in the right
direction to ensure consistency and clarity on Shari’ah governance of Islamic banks. While the
authorities broadly agreed, they indicated that some areas of corporate governance, notably related
to Boards composition, need to take into account the scarcity of qualified resources.
21.
GREs should continue to manage their debt profiles proactively. As some GREs are
highly indebted, managing upcoming debt repayments proactively is important, including using
timely communication to guide market expectations and to contain financial stability risks posed by
GREs. Improvements in GRE risk management, reporting, transparency, and governance are critical
for further strengthening of GREs. A transfer of maturing debt by GREs to domestic banks should be
avoided to preserve banking sector stability, while raising risk-weights of lending to GREs could
make such transfer costly to banks. Also, the amendments to the governance rules of publicly listed
companies, to better protect minority shareholders in GREs, will help limit excessive leverage and
related-party transactions. The authorities noted that GREs are not a major concern as they have
made progress in repaying back debt ahead of the payment schedules and are not cashconstrained.
22.
Authorities’ ongoing efforts to strengthen the AML/CFT framework and address derisking should continue. Recent efforts include the adoption of by-laws in 2015, the launching of
the national risk assessment, and the inclusion of AML/CFT requirements into risk-based supervision
of banks. These welcome efforts should be pursued by timely conducting the national risk
assessment, enhancing the monitoring of domestic and cross border financial flows, further
upgrading the regulatory requirements for banks and exchange houses, improving the availability
and use of beneficial ownership information on legal persons and trusts, and speeding up the
development of risk-based tools for assessing the exposure of the banking and remittance activities
to ML/TF threats while enhancing the mitigation of corresponding risks. These measures, combined
with harmonization of procedures for creating legal persons in free zones and monitoring their

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

activities, would contribute to easing de-risking practices by correspondent banks. In a recent survey
run by the Arab Monetary Fund and Central Bank of the UAE, it was observed that some UAE banks
had one or more correspondent banking relationships (CBRs) terminated, though most of them
were able establish or use alternative relationships. Authorities remain concerned about de-risking
and intend to continue their dialogue with foreign regulators and local and foreign banks to prevent
disruptive losses of CBRs.
Further Diversifying Growth
23.
Structural reforms should be pursued to strengthen competitiveness. The UAE is one of
the most competitive economies of the region (Figure 6). However, reforms should continue at the
federal and local levels to improve lagging areas of business environment such as starting a
business, getting credit, enforcing contracts, streamlining exports procedures and resolving
insolvency. Efficient public investment in infrastructure should be maintained, including through
PPPs. In that regard, the new framework approved by Dubai government is welcome and should be
accompanied by further strengthening the capability of the department of finance to monitor the
related contingent liabilities.
24.
Transitioning toward a knowledge-driven economy as envisaged in the UAE Vision
2021 would raise productivity, which has been a drag on non-oil growth (see Appendix VI).
Supportive policies include relaxing restrictions on foreign ownership outside the free zone areas,
further improving access to international markets and global supply chains, easing migration
policies for highly-skilled workers, fostering competition, upgrading the quality of education, and
continuing to harness innovation and the use of new technologies of information and
communication. In particular, the new investment law should further ease restrictions on FDI while
avoiding to set thresholds in terms of capital to benefit from the new regime, which could reduce
attractiveness for innovative SMEs and startups. Priority should also be given to innovation
financing. The innovation fund envisaged by the authorities is a good step in this direction, and
should be supported by improving the framework for venture capital and crowd-funding. Raising
productivity and improving competitiveness, along with targeted reforms to promote exports, will
create the right conditions to continue to further diversify away from oil, in line with the authorities’
objective to reduce the oil share in the GDP by a third over the next decade.
25.
Public employment and labor market policies could be improved to spur private
sector-led job creation for nationals. In that regard, it is important to control the size and wages
of the civil service, which is critical to private sector competitiveness and attractiveness for nationals,
to improve the skills-job match, notably by developing plans of education for employment and
further integrating soft skills in the curricula, and to promote entrepreneurship, including through
re-skilling, business incubation and other support services. Policies such as quotas, flexible work
arrangements, provision of childcare services and active labor market programs could help increase
women’s participation in the workforce. In this regard, the new regulation by the Securities and
Commodities Authority setting, on a “comply or explain” basis, a quota of 20 percent of women in
the boards of listed companies is welcome.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

26.
Easing SME access to finance should be a priority. SME lending is estimated to represent
only 4 percent of total lending and more than 77 percent of SMEs are reported lacking access to
finance.3 The inadequacy of the insolvency framework hurts SMEs access to finance and needs to be
tackled by a swift approval of the bankruptcy law, which the authorities consider a high priority.
Public funds should focus on providing guarantees and support services to SMEs and startups
instead of direct lending. Efforts to strengthen the financial infrastructure, notably through broader
coverage of the credit bureau, should be pursued, as planned by the authorities. Measures should
be taken to promote capital market financing of SMEs, including through listing on equity markets
and securitization of assets for debt issuance.
Improving Statistics
27.
Further efforts are required to strengthen the statistical system. The authorities have
made significant progress on fiscal, monetary and financial sector statistics. Further progress is
needed to improve national accounts and external sector statistics, including the compilation of an
international investment position, and to compile labor market statistics. In that regard, it is
important to continue to strengthen coordination and data-sharing between the federal and local
statistical agencies. Efforts are also needed to broaden the coverage of government statistics to
GREs and of monetary and financial statistics to non-bank financial institutions.

STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
With persistently lower oil prices, macro-financial stability risks have increased. Fiscal
and external positions have weakened, despite the strong policy response in terms of fiscal
consolidation, which in turn has led to a softening of economic activity and an uptick of credit risks.
In addition, deficit financing has put pressure on liquidity and led to a further tightening of
monetary and financial conditions. However, the large buffers built over time have helped limit
negative inward spillovers and contain the softening of investor appetite.
29.
The macroeconomic policy mix should focus on gradual fiscal consolidation, while
maintaining the peg and employing a financing strategy that supports private credit growth.
Greater fiscal consolidation than planned by the authorities will be needed over the medium term to
close the gap to the level of non-oil fiscal balance that is consistent with intergenerational equity
and to support external sustainability. However, in view of the ample policy space provided by the
UAE’s large buffers, the pace of consolidation should be eased in 2016 to minimize its impact on
growth at a time when sentiment is weak on account of the drop in oil prices. The peg remains
appropriate as an anchor for price and financial stability, and should be maintained while efforts
should be continued to enhance liquidity management, develop domestic debt markets and reduce
foreign exchange exposure of banks and firms. Deficit financing should tap into sovereign wealth
funds and international capital markets, instead of drawing down government deposits or incurring

payment arrears. The CBU should stand ready to use its instruments if needed to support healthy
liquidity.
30.
In terms of composition, priority should be given to diversifying revenues and
rationalizing current spending. Authorities’ plans to introduce the VAT and increase excise taxes in
2018 are welcome, whose implementation should be followed by the introduction of a corporate
income tax. Remaining subsidies should be phased out while protecting lower-tier consumers. Other
current spending should continue to be curbed, while public investment should be preserved and its
efficiency enhanced.
31.
Public financial and debt management frameworks should continue to be
strengthened. Developing a consolidated forward-looking medium-term fiscal framework would
assist the authorities in setting direction for fiscal policy in the UAE as a whole and aligning resource
allocation with the 2021 vision. In addition, strong Public Finance Management systems at the local
level are needed to increase budget credibility and comprehensiveness. In the context of lower
transfers by emirate governments to GREs and planned megaprojects, strengthening debt
management frameworks is important to properly account for contingent liabilities from GREs as
well as other Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs).
32.
The ongoing revision of the central bank and banking law is an opportunity to
strengthen prudential frameworks. The new law should further enhance central bank
independence and governance, align the macroprudential institutional framework with best
practices, enhance regulation and supervision of the banking sector in line with global standards,
strengthen safety nets and improve the resolution framework. In particular, the authorities should
develop a fully-fledged macroprudential framework and, in the meantime, should not relax the
existing measures aimed at containing systemic liquidity risks and vulnerabilities from the real estate
sector.
33.
CBU’s plans to strengthen regulation and supervision of the banking sector should be
timely implemented. Overall, the banking sector has enough capital and liquidity buffers to
withstand an adverse shock. Plans to encourage banks identified in the stress tests to strengthen
their capital and liquidity positions are appropriate. Also, the CBU should continue to ensure
adequate credit provisioning. The CBU’s plans to phase in the Basel III capital framework, including
capital surcharges for systemically important banks and counter-cyclical capital buffers, to strictly
enforce loan concentration limits for GREs and local governments, to strengthen corporate
governance, and to move toward risk-based supervision should be implemented as planned.
Ongoing efforts to strengthen the AML/CFT framework and address de-risking should also be
pursued.
34.
Structural reforms aimed at raising productivity, improving competitiveness and
further diversifying the economy should be pursued. Reforms should continue at the federal and
local levels to improve lagging areas of business environment such as starting a business, obtaining
credit, enforcing contracts, streamlining export procedures and resolving insolvency. Transition
towards a knowledge-driven economy should be accelerated. In this regard, the new investment law

should ease restrictions on FDI. Priority should be given to implementing the innovation strategy,
notably by developing the policy framework for innovation financing such as venture capital and
crowd-funding. Private sector-led job creation for nationals would require controlling the size and
wages of the civil service, improving the skills-job match, and promoting entrepreneurship. To ease
SMEs and startups’ access to finance, the bankruptcy law should be swiftly approved, public funds
more focused on providing guarantees, the credit bureau coverage broadened, and market
financing enabled.
35.
Further progress is needed in improving statistics. Improvements in external sector,
national accounts, trade and labor market statistics are needed. In this regard, better coordination
between the federal and the local levels is critical. Also, building on significant progress made over
the past year, the authorities should broaden the coverage of fiscal accounts and financial sector
indicators.
36.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12month cycle.

Appendix I. Long-Term Fiscal Sustainability Analysis
Staff analysis based on the permanent income hypothesis suggests that under conservative
baseline assumptions, the non-oil primary balance is lower than the level consistent with
intergenerational equity, but favorable persistent shocks could imply a smaller gap.4 The gap
between the projected deficits and the deficits consistent with a constant real per capita annuity was
about 7.6 percent of non-hydrocarbon GDP in 2015 (see chart). With the gradual fiscal consolidation
assumed in the baseline, the gap is projected to shrink to about 2.5 percent of non-hydrocarbon
GDP by 2021.

Long-term sustainability assumes intergenerational equity by calculating a constant real per capita government
spending path (and related nonhydrocarbon deficit) that delivers a constant real per capita annuity to finance
government spending after hydrocarbon revenues are exhausted. Projections until 2021 are based on staff’s macroframework, including the WEO assumptions about the oil price. After 2021, the baseline scenario assumes flat
hydrocarbon production and annual oil price growth of 2 percent, inflation of 2 percent, population growth of
1.5 percent, and real return on assets of 4 percent. Alternative scenarios assume (i) lower population growth by
0.5 percentage point, (ii) lower real return on assets by 1 percentage point, (iii) lower oil price by $10 in 2016-21 and
to remain constant thereafter, and (iv) higher oil price by $10 in 2016-21 and to increase by 2 percent per annum in
nominal terms thereafter.

Appendix II. Debt Sustainability Analysis
The UAE public debt is sustainable and its net financial assets are large when including sovereign
wealth funds’ assets. Gross debt-to-GDP is estimated at 16.6 percent in 2015, below the 2005-2013
average of 18.5 percent. This ratio is projected to pick up to 17.0 percent in 2016, and to decrease over
the medium term as the primary balance turns to surplus and growth picks up. This ratio could double
if a severe scenario with lower oil prices and higher defaults by GREs materializes. In Dubai, the debt
ratio could triple if there is a severe shock to the real estate sector compounded with a global
downturn. However, these risks can be mitigated by the large fiscal buffers.
The baseline scenario is underpinned by the following assumptions:
Growth. The oil sector growth is expected to remain broadly constant while non-oil GDP growth is
projected to slow to 2.4 percent in 2016, before gradually increasing to 4 percent over the mediumterm. This will be underpinned by the pickup in private investment in the run-up to the Expo 2020.
Overall GDP growth is projected to range between 2.3 and 3.7 percent over the medium term.
Interest rates. Effective interest rates are projected to increase from 4.5 percent in 2016 to
6.2 percent in 2021, in line with the upward trend in global rates projected by the WEO.
Fiscal adjustment. The projected path of the cyclically adjusted primary balance (CAPB) reflects the
fiscal measures adopted so far and the authorities’ plans to contain current spending and diversify
revenue over the medium term.
The projected decrease in debt reflects improving primary balances and decreasing interest
rate-growth differential. The primary deficit is expected to widen in 2016, before improving and
turn to a surplus by 2018. As a result, the gross financing needs are expected to increase to
[7.8] percent of GDP and to decrease over the medium-term. Part of the financing needs in the first
two years would be provided by the sovereign wealth funds. These trends, together with growth
picking up above the interest rate, would help lower the debt to GDP ratios.
Debt is sensitive to a number of shocks:
Combined lower oil prices with GREs defaults. In a scenario which combines lower oil prices by
$10 with 20 percent of GRE debt taken over by the government in 2017-21, total debt to GDP in the
UAE will double to 31 percent by 2021.
Combined global downturn with a real estate shock. In a scenario which combines a sharp decline in
GDP growth with a real estate shock and the government taking over 20 percent of total GREs debt
in 2017-21, total debt in Dubai would increase by about 40 percentage points of its GDP.

1/ Based on available data.
2/ Abu Dhabi's Long-term bond spread over U.S. bonds. 5Y CDS is also related to the Emirate of Abu Dhabi.
3/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
4/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
5/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
6/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
7/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
Also indicates that public debt increases by more than the borrowing requirement.
8/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

3/ This scenario combines the oil price and the GRE contingent liability scenarios.

Source: IMF staff.

Fiscal Risks Captured by the Alternative Scenarios


Lower oil prices. An illustrative drop in oil prices by $10 a barrel would put the gross debt ratio
on an upward path. The primary balance would deteriorate to 0.9 percent of GDP in 2021, with
government debt and gross financing needs rising to 26.1 percent and 7.4 percent of GDP,
respectively.



GRE contingent liability. The scenario assumes that the government gradually takes over
20 percent of GRE debt (in 2017-21). The primary balance deteriorates to 2.2 percent of GDP in
2021, with government debt and gross financing needs increasing to 20.1 percent and
3.6 percent of GDP, respectively.



Combined scenario. This scenario combines the oil price and GRE contingent liability scenarios.
The primary balance would deteriorate to -0.1 percent of GDP in 2021, with debt and financing
needs rising to 32.1 percent and 10.9 percent of GDP, respectively.

Dubai Government’s Debt Sustainability
While Dubai’s government debt sustainability has improved, it could still rise sharply under severe
shocks:


A sharp decline in GDP growth in 2016 (by ¾ standard deviation from the baseline) and a
gradual recovery in 2017–21 would raise the debt-to-GDP ratio by about 8.8 percentage points
in 2021 compared to the baseline.



Under a severe global downturn scenario, which assumes a real GDP shock, lower real interest
rates, and deterioration in the primary balance in the medium term, Dubai’s government debt
would increase to about 32.2 percent of GDP in 2021.



A scenario that combines a global downturn with a real estate shock, under which the
government would take over 20 percent of the GREs’ total debt in the medium term, would
imply a substantial increase in the government debt-to-GDP ratio, to 59.6 percent, three times
as large as under the baseline.

Appendix III. United Arab Emirates: External Sector Assessment
Overall Assessment: The UAE’s external position is moderately weaker than suggested by
fundamentals. The peg to the US dollar continues to serve the UAE well. Projections over the medium
term show a current account gap that could be closed with fiscal policy adjustment. The decline in the
oil price reduced the current account surplus in 2015 and is expected to further reduce in 2016. The
projected upward trend in oil prices will improve the current account over the medium term. While the
EBA-lite approaches project a current account gap in 2016, the very strong external balance sheet and
access to capital markets are mitigating factors. Given the structure of the UAE’s economy and the
high import content (labor as well intermediate inputs) of non-oil exports, exchange rate adjustment
would have only a limited impact on external competitiveness and would instead affect the external
position mainly through its impact on the fiscal balance. Thus, in view of the need to maintain the peg
as a credible anchor for prices and financial stability, external adjustment should be driven by direct
fiscal adjustment rather than fiscal adjustment via the exchange rate.

I.

FOREIGN ASSET AND LIABILITY POSITION AND TRAJECTORY

Background. The UAE’s net international investment position (NIIP) is estimated at 181 percent of
GDP at end-2015 and is mainly dominated by assets held in the Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs).
Central bank international reserves are comfortable and estimated at 25 percent of GDP by end2015 or 6.9 months of imports. External liabilities were 52 percent of GDP (portfolio 3% and debt
49%). Projections suggest that the NIIP over GDP ratio will remain broadly stable over the medium
term.

per capita basis is 4.4 percent of GDP in 2015,
implying a current account gap of 1.1 percent of GDP. Because the model allows consumption
smoothing, the norm declines relative to 2014 in line with the oil price. Under the baseline,
improvements in the current account balance are expected to marginally reduce some of the
shortfall over the medium term, suggesting a need to save a bigger share of the oil wealth.
However, these results are sensitive to assumptions and goals. With different scenarios, the CA gap
varies between about 0.2 and 8 percent of GDP for 2016. Overall, this metric points to a moderate

current account gap and the need for higher fiscal savings. However, the substantial assets held
under the SWFs represent both savings of the exhaustible resource revenues for future generations
and protection against vulnerabilities from oil price volatility.

surplus.
Assessment. For 2015, the EBA-Lite CA model predicts a CAB of 4.1 percent of GDP based on actual
policies, and estimates a cyclically adjusted CA gap of [0.8] percent of GDP. Similar to other large
exporters of non-renewable resources affected by oil market volatility, the UAE’s CA is subject to
wide swings, and the assessment of its external position is subject to a high degree of uncertainty
although the country’s relatively diversified structure of exports provides a cushion to mitigate these
risks. The current account gap in 2015 was mostly driven by fiscal policy. The 2015 cyclicallyadjusted CA is broadly in line with the level implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable
policies (i.e., the gap would be removed if the desirable fiscal policy setting is achieved).

III.

REAL EXCHANGE RATE

Background. The Dirham has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at a rate of 3.67 since November 1997.
The real effective exchange rate (REER) has appreciated by 9.5 percent over 2015 and by about
20 percent compared to a decade ago. The recent REER appreciation is driven mostly by the U.S.

Assessment. Indirect estimates of the REER
(relying on the CA and ES approaches)
suggest an overvaluation of the Dirham
within 1 to 7 percent. However, the REER
index model suggests the exchange rate was

8 percent in 2014. Considering all estimates
and the uncertainties around them, staff

moderately overvalued, within a range of 2 to 10 percent, compared to the level implied by
medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. Similar to other oil exporting countries,
exchange rate movements have limited impact on the current account. External current account
adjustment will occur through further fiscal consolidation.

IV.

CAPITAL AND FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS: FLOWS AND POLICY MEASURES

Background. Capital inflows are dominated by stable FDI, inflows to the banking sector, and
external debt issuances, while outflows are largely trade credits and portfolio investment. Capital
account is open and domestic capital markets are the most developed in the region with significant
portfolio and investment inflows. Steps to further attract FDI inflows are ongoing. The overall
external balance sheet remains very strong.
Assessment. There are no immediate risks or vulnerabilities associated with capital flows.

V.

FX INTERVENTION AND RESERVES LEVEL

Background. The UAE’s external assets are composed of the CBU’s international reserves and of
assets held under the SWFs. The SWFs’ assets play a dual role for both precautionary motives and as
savings for future generations.
Assessment. External assets are more than adequate for precautionary purposes (measured by the
Fund’s metrics). Nevertheless, a larger current account surplus and resulting NIIP accumulation
would be needed to ensure that

Appendix IV. Performance and Risks Posed by
Government Related Entities (GREs)
While UAE’s balance sheet as a whole is strong, GREs continue to pose significant fiscal and financial
stability risks. The size of UAE publicly-held government debt is small, while fiscal and external buffers
are large. It is only when the debt of the GREs is accounted for that full scale of the risk faced by the
sovereign balance sheet becomes visible, as well as its potential implications for the domestic banking
sector and debt capital markets. Rollover risks have increased with large fiscal financing needs and the
lift-off of the US interest rate. In addition, worsening domestic and external conditions might lead to
increased leverage of GREs and higher default probability, ultimately putting further strains on the
financial system and the fiscal accounts.
GREs have strengthened their overall finances, especially in Abu Dhabi. GREs have been a major
source of growth and development for the UAE economy. Benefiting from government transfers and
extensive borrowing, in 2004-2008, GREs funded a major push for Dubai’s economy while major
infrastructure projects were also developed in Abu Dhabi by GREs. In 2008-09, despite government
support, the global financial crisis and the price correction in the local property market combined
with the maturity mismatch between short-term liabilities and long-term cash flows forced several
GREs to restructure their debt. Since the crisis episode, several GREs have actively managed their
debt, making early repayments and lengthening their maturity profiles.
Leverage remains high while its composition has shifted from loans to bonds. GREs’ debt, in
relation to GDP has decreased in both Abu

lower than in many developed European countries, which saw large increases following the global

exposes firms more to volatile financial conditions.

With about US$80.5 billion maturing in 2016-18,
both Dubai and to a lesser extent Abu Dhabi face short-term rollover risks. Our estimates
suggest that US$51.6 billion of Dubai’s debt will come due in 2016-18 while over US$28.9 billion of
Abu Dhabi’s debt will also come due in 2016-18. These are large maturities in a context of
tightening domestic liquidity, competition from local governments to finance deficits, and possible
reversal of capital inflows. Short-term rollover risks may translate into higher cost of funding, which
could put further strains on debt servicing capacity and ultimately on the financial system and the
fiscal accounts. In addition, as most of the corporate debt is denominated in foreign currency (FX),
rollover risks could be reflected in an increase in the forward exchange rate premium.

GREs pose contingent fiscal and financial risks. An adverse scenario could significantly worsen
the government balance sheet, be transmitted to the financial sector and contribute to feedback
loops. As public transfers have been made to support specific companies (financial and nonfinancial), the market perceives that governments implicitly guarantee GREs’ debt. A scenario that
combines a global downturn with a real estate shock under which the government would take over
20 percent of the GREs’ debt would imply a substantial increase in the government debt-to-GDP
ratio, to 32.1 percent, twice as large as under the baseline scenario (14.1 percent of GDP in 2016),
which illustrates the significant fiscal risks. Regarding financial risks, loans to GREs have increased by
6 percent so far in 2016 and correspond to about 7.6 percent of the assets of the banking sector.
Greater corporate leverage could render firms less able to withstand negative shocks to income or
asset values and quickly spill over to the financial sector, generating a vicious cycle as banks curtail
lending.
Panel regression analysis suggests that the evolution of GREs’ leverage is expected to be
closely associated not only with firm-specific factors, but also with macroeconomic and
financial conditions. In this model, the change in the ratio of assets over equity of GREs depends
on firm-specific measures of size (sales), profitability (return on assets), ICR, asset tangibility (to
reflect collateral availability and asset quality) and ICR, and on contemporaneous macroeconomic
factors including non-hydrocarbon primary government deficit, oil price, UAE interbank rate, US
dollar index, an exchange market volatility index (VIX), and corporate spreads. Preliminary results
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

49

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES

suggest that individual firm factors, especially profitability, continue to play an important role in
determining the change in leverage, but that the fiscal position of the government and financial and
monetary conditions also have a significant impact.
Containing GRE borrowing is a pre-condition for fiscal sustainability and financial stability at
the emirate level and requires a strong institutional framework. The functioning of the debt
management office in Abu Dhabi is a good example that should be undertaken at the federal level.
In order to contain further risk-taking, any borrowing at the emirate level should require the assent
of the emirate finance department which would provide a strong signal of financial market stability
and debt sustainability.
Improved corporate governance and transparency are also key for mitigating risks posed by
GREs. In particular, it would be important to delineate clearly between the commercial and
noncommercial operations carried out by GREs, clarify the government support strategy, and
standardize the accounting, auditing, and financial reporting practices. Better information disclosure
would help attract investors and ultimately will translate into lower funding costs. Improvements in
corporate governance and risk management will also help investors to assess GRE risks.

Appendix V. The Effect of Lower Oil Prices and Higher Short-Term
Interest Rates on the Default Risk of the Corporate and Banking
Sectors and on the Banking System Liquidity Buffers
The default risk of the UAE corporate and banking sectors can be assessed by analyzing
probabilities of default (PDs) under different macroeconomic scenarios. The National University
of Singapore (NUS) forward intensity model is flexible enough to incorporate not only defaults but
also exits of firms from mergers and acquisitions.
In the model specification calibrated with UAE data, the PDs are a function of independent
common and bank-specific risk factors such as the stock market index, short-term interest rate,
distance-to-default (the expected difference between the asset value and the default barrier,
adjusted and normalized by asset volatility), profitability, size, market-to-book value, and
idiosyncratic volatility. Both common and firm-specific risk factors are then driven by
macroeconomic risk factors such as oil price changes, real nonoil GDP growth, consumer price
inflation, and changes in the three-month EIBOR interbank rate. The NUS model is calibrated with
monthly data for the period January 1990-December 2015 for a total of 74 listed UAE firms, of which
17 firms are banks while the remaining 57 ones are either private firms (47) or GREs (10). Annual
macroeconomic data are interpolated accordingly.
1

The projections for the PDs require defining scenarios for macroeconomic risk factors. The first
scenario is a baseline consistent with the 2016-21 macroeconomic framework (see Tables 2-5). The
oil shock scenario consists of a sudden but permanent $10 reduction in oil prices throughout 2021
and a cumulative 1.7 percent decline in nonoil GDP (relative to baseline) over the period 2016-21
associated with the gradual fiscal consolidation that would be needed to eliminate the additional
fiscal deficit resulting from lower oil revenues.2 The interest rate shock scenario consists of an
increase of 100 bps in the EIBOR interbank rate both in 2016 and 2017.
The PDs for the 74 listed firms are low but rising and, under the adverse oil shock scenario in
particular, the PDs for the corporate sector would increase to the highest levels since 2009.
During the financial crisis, the average PD for the 17 UAE banks spiked to 100 bps while the average
PD for other UAE firms peaked at 38 bps. After the financial crisis, UAE banks became safer than
other UAE firms. While the average PD for UAE banks gradually declined to 7.2 bps in May 2013, it
remained below the average PD for other UAE firms in the period September 2011-March 2015.
Since then, the average PD for banks has been higher than the PD for other firms. Within the
corporate sector, the GREs PDs have been substantially trending down on average, although these
might understate risks posed by this group as the sample is small. Looking forward, under both the
lower oil price and higher interest rate scenarios, PDs for UAE banks and other UAE firms are

projected to significantly increase. Under the adverse oil shock scenario with economic slowdown,
PDs are forecast to spike and reach their highest levels since the 2009 crisis.
Even though the empirical literature on the determinants of bank liquidity is new, it can help
shed light on the effect of lower oil prices and higher US interest rates on liquidity buffers. To
assess the determinants of liquidity buffers in UAE domestic banks, a parsimonious specification
should include not only bank-specific characteristics but also oil prices and interest rates as
explanatory variables. Liquidity buffers are proxied by the inverse of loan-to-deposit ratio, the
interbank assets-to-interbank deposits ratio, and the liquid assets-to-customer deposits and shortterm funding ratio. Explanatory variables include total assets (in log), return on asset (ROA), Tier 1
capital ratio, cost-to-income ratio, the net loans-to-total assets ratio, net interest margin, the change
in the Fed funds rate (in percentage points), and the percentage change in Brent oil prices,
government deposits, and non-oil GDP to account for economic activity. These indicators are
collected for a sample of 17 domestic banks for the period 2005:Q1-2015:Q4. However, not all
indicators are available for the full period range. The estimation method is unbalanced panel data
regression with fixed effects and clustered standard errors to account for autocorrelation within and
across banks. Dummy variables are included to capture quarterly seasonality.
The results of the panel data estimation are consistent with previous literature where both
bank-specific and macroeconomic factors play a role in determining liquidity buffers. The
liquid assets-to-customer deposits and short-term debt ratio appears to be affected by oil price
changes. As expected, higher oil prices in an oil exporting country can lead to higher customer
deposits, helping banks fund their operations and increase their liquidity buffers. A possible
explanation for the low statistical significance of macroeconomic factors in the dynamics of the
loan-to-deposits ratio is that adverse and favorable macroeconomic factors affect simultaneously
both deposits and loans as business confidence rises or deteriorates.
These results shed light on the importance of strengthening liquidity and capital
requirements in line with Basel III standards, as well as banks’ corporate governance. Increased
PDs in the corporate sector call for adequate provisioning and strengthened capital requirements
for banks, enforcing loan-concentration limits and tight control of related-party lending, and
ensuring adequate provisioning of banks’ portfolio. Regarding liquidity, supervisors should
encourage banks to increase transparency on maturity mismatches in their market disclosures,
diversify their funding sources, strengthen their treasury function, and maintain a cushion of highquality liquid assets. For example, the limited information available on projected cash flows on a
contractual basis published as part of annual reports and Basel II pillar III disclosures indicate that,
overall, there is a short-term liquidity gap within the three-month maturity bucket in UAE banks and
liquidity surpluses in the longer time horizon maturity buckets. It is also important to further
develop safety nets and resolution frameworks, and to continue strengthening the AML/CFT
framework.

Appendix VI. Competitiveness and Economic Diversification in the
Context of Fiscal Consolidation
The UAE has seen remarkable transformation already and its authorities have ambitious goals for
further economic diversification to position the country so that it can celebrate its last barrel of
exported oil. As the other countries’ experience suggests, the road to economic diversification is long
and challenging, but can be successfully travelled by promoting private sector-led, knowledge-driven,
export-oriented growth.
Output growth volatility is still largely driven by oil. Within the GCC, the UAE is the third fastest
growing economy and its output has been the least volatile

after Bahrain. When compared to countries that managed to

successfully diversify away from commodity exports such as

and level of sophistication of exported goods. In terms of
export quality, the UAE compare favorably with the region, and Chile and Indonesia but has great
strides to make when compared to Malaysia and Mexico. Overall export quality in the UAE has
increased over time but the improvements have been uneven and concentrated in hydrocarbon and
chemical products. The quality of other exported goods requiring higher labor skills such as the
manufactured goods, machinery and transport equipment declined. In addition, the UAE produces
very low levels of high technology goods when compared to CIMM.

Where are the UAE’s gaps? Low and declining productivity has been a drag on non-oil growth,
which has been driven by capital accumulation, financed from oil receipts, and a rapid expansion of
imported foreign labor. In terms of competitiveness, the UAE compares very favorably with
advanced economies, especially in the areas of infrastructure and the quality of the macroeconomic

environment. However, in other areas which are
important for productivity such as innovation,
financial market developments, higher education
and training, and business sophistication, the UAE
compares less favorably when compared to
advanced economies, but favorably with its peers,
including the CIMM. There are also a few
bottlenecks to doing business that could limit
diversification prospects such as the cost of
starting a business or trading across borders.

Policies and reforms going forward. In line with the authorities’ vision, reforms should focus on
developing the private sector, transitioning toward a knowledge-driven economy and expanding
export industries.
• Further developing the private sector. Reforms aiming at strengthening competitiveness
should be given a high priority to improve lagging areas of business environment while preserving
macroeconomic and financial stability and maintaining a world-class infrastructure. Easing SMEs’
and startups’ access to finance and providing them with targeted public support to incubate
businesses, access markets and raise productivity could help promote an entrepreneurship culture.
Incentives to nationals should favor entrepreneurship instead of public employment or rent-seeking.
• Accelerating transition toward a knowledge-driven economy. In this regard, it is
important to facilitate technology transfer through further openness to foreign direct investment,
trade and migration of highly skilled people. Fostering competition, including by lowering barriers to
entry and reducing the public sector footprint, would also raise efficiency. Boosting innovation is key
and could be supported through higher R&D spending, better linkages between firms and
universities, improved framework for intellectual property rights, more integration to global supply
chains and adequate financing. In the latter area, authorities’ plans to set up an innovation fund are
welcome and could be used to provide seed money for innovative ideas, and need to be
accompanied by private sector funding through venture capital and crowd-funding. It is also
essential to continue enhancing the quality and relevance of education and training, and promoting
diffusion and use of new technologies of information and communication, including through
electronic and mobile government services.
• Developing exporting industries. Countries’ experiences show that diversification policy
often followed a mix of vertical diversification in existing export industries and horizontal
diversification in suppliers’ clusters for those industries into high-value-added and innovation
sectors. Policies include better access to international markets, incentives to make exports sectors
more attractive than non-tradables, tailored export promotion services such as marketing,
standardization, financing and guarantees, and the creation of platforms for industrial clusters.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of May 2016)
Technical cooperation between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the Bank began in 1980, starting
with a comprehensive national health assessment study. Cooperation focused on preparing select
reports in areas such as water and environmental management, debt market development, and in
labor market development. More recently, cooperation has significantly expanded under the
auspices of the Ministry of Finance to help assess financial implications of various health insurance
schemes and prepare Public Expenditure Reviews and action-plans in several sectors (health,
education, higher education, public works). These have been inputs in the preparation of the new
budget cycle, and in the upgrade of public financial management laws in line with best practice. In
addition, discussions are underway to support fiscal coordination efforts among Emirates.
The Bank has also delivered technical assistance to individual Emirates including to: (i) the Abu
Dhabi Judicial Department to improve performance and services; (ii) Dubai Knowledge Authority to
enhance private education outcomes through governance mechanisms and (iii) Ajman and Ras Al
Khaimah to enhance the business environment.
Dialogue is currently underway for possible cooperation with the Ministry of Community Development
to consolidate and enhance the effectiveness of various social assistance schemes, with Abu Dhabi
Department of Economic Development to update Vision 2030 with a focus on reducing reliance on
oil exports, and with Emirate utilities to enhance their financial sustainability.
Cooperation with the authorities to support the World Government Summit would evolve to a longterm partnership focusing on innovation in government service delivery and on sharing lessons of
country experience in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of June 2016)
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision has some shortcomings but is broadly adequate for surveillance. There are
substantial shortcomings on the dissemination of accounts of government-related entities (GREs). In
particular, there is limited data on GRE debt and contingent liabilities to the government. The federal and
individual emirates’ agencies have improved the availability and quality of their statistics, but more
progress is needed. The adoption of the Federal Statistics Law in May 2009, and the establishment of an
independent National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) were important steps in creating a statistical system at the
federal level. The NBS has since been restructured with another federal agency to form the Federal

Competitiveness and Statistics Authority (FCSA) in September 2015.
National Accounts: The methodology broadly conforms to the 1993 SNA. GDP is compiled annually with
a lag of around 5 months. National accounts compilation is undertaken by the FCSA and regional (Emirati)
statistical agencies of Abu Dhabi and Dubai. These regional statistical agencies are independent of the
FCSA and function as the central agencies of the respective Emirates. They report directly to the Emirates
governments. This creates problems of priorities and hinders the sharing of data by the regions to the
FCSA. Although the FCSA is responsible for compiling the national estimates of GDP, in reality, it only
compiles estimates for the Northern Emirates (the UAE, excluding emirates of Abu Dhabi and Dubai).
These are then added to the regional estimates for Abu Dhabi and Dubai that are compiled by the
Statistics Center of Abu Dhabi (SCAD) and the Dubai Statistics Center (DSC) respectively, to derive a
national estimate. The process of summing the gross value added (GVA) compiled by the three agencies to
arrive at national GDP is not advisable and should be discontinued. The compilation process is not
consistent across the three agencies as they use different data sources and compilation techniques to
estimate GVA for the same activities. The base year for the GDP estimates is 2007 and is therefore
outdated.
Price statistics: Data are published with a delay of one month. Consumer price indexes need further
harmonization at the federal level.
Government finance statistics: In 2011, GFSM 2001 was introduced by the federal and several emirate
governments, and the institutional arrangement to ensure adequate data provision was established. This
consolidation should complement initiatives to establish debt management units at both the emirate and
federal levels. The UAE submitted its fiscal accounts to the GFS Yearbook for the first time in 2012. The
coverage of these data now extends to the consolidated general government operations. It is anticipated
that the remaining emirates should produce GFS data in 2016 and that the UAE will continue to build a
time series for GFS data in relation to fiscal accounts. This will include improved balance sheet information.
Monetary statistics: The central bank has shifted the responsibility for compiling and disseminating
monetary data to the Research and Statistics Department (RSD), in order to improve the timeliness of data
to monthly frequency with less than a month lag. The CBUAE submitted monetary data for the central
bank and deposit money banks using the old report forms that have some deviations from the
recommended methodology. An STA mission visited the UAE in November 2015 to assist the authorities in
compiling their monetary and financial statistics using the IMF’s standardized report forms (SRFs). It is
expected that the CBUAE will start disseminating SRF based monetary data in September 2016. A follow-

5

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES

up STA mission will visit the UAE during FY2017 to assist the CBUAE in developing report forms for the
other financial corporations (OFCs) that would be used for compiling monetary data for the OFCs.
Financial sector surveillance: The central bank reports quarterly FSIs to the Fund, which are disseminated
on the IMF’s FSI website (fsi.imf.org). The reported FSIs at this stage only include the 12 core FSIs for
deposit takers. The November 2015 TA mission from STA recommended the central bank to also compile
and report encouraged FSIs for deposit takers and other sectors.
Balance of Payments: The information needed to compile the balance of payments is insufficient,
especially for the financial account. Many components of the IIP also are missing or incomplete, as the
data on government foreign assets and private holdings of foreign assets and liabilities are not published
or lack appropriate surveys. The development of a comprehensive BOP and IIP is however within the reach
of the UAE if the central bank, the NBS, and the Ministry of Economy strengthen their capacity and receive
appropriate support at the high level. The central bank has introduced an international transactions
reporting system to strengthen the quality of balance of payments statistics. The authorities continue a
project to compile the IIP, which will close an important statistical gap. An STA follow-up mission will visit
the UAE in January 2017 to support the authorities in progressing with strengthening their BOP/IIP.

Statement by Hazem Beblawi Executive Director for the
United Arab Emirates and Mira Merhi, Advisor
July 20, 2016

1.
On behalf of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) authorities, we would like to thank staff
for the candid and constructive policy discussions in Abu Dhabi and Dubai during the Article
IV mission. The authorities appreciate staff’s high quality report and broadly concur with
staff’s assessment of the current economic conditions as well as their policy recommendations.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
2.
The UAE economy demonstrated remarkable resilience in the face of the oil price
decline and continues to benefit from its safe-haven status in a turbulent regional environment.
The non-oil economy grew by 3¾ percent in 2015 despite a contraction of public investment
as a result of further fiscal consolidation in Abu Dhabi. The diversification of the economy
has helped to mitigate the impact of the decline in oil prices, with non-oil activities
contributing to more than two thirds of the country’s gross domestic product (up from only
20 percent in the 1980s).
3.
The growth outlook is expected to somewhat moderate in 2016 amid low oil prices
and a slowdown in investments due to the continued commitment for fiscal consolidation.
However, going forward, investments related to Expo 2020 such as the expansion of the
national network of airports and rail network, air and maritime transport means, roads,
tourism facilities, real estate as well as the knowledge based economy are expected to further
support higher growth from 2017 onwards.
4.
While the UAE’s growth prospects are favorable, the authorities remain vigilant about
external and domestic risks as elaborated in the staff report. However, these potential risks are
mitigated by the country’s substantial foreign assets and low level of debt which provide
ample financial buffers and policy space. The authorities’ plan is to further reduce the
contribution of oil to GDP to less than 20 percent by 2021, as per the National Vision 2021.
Implementation of this vision will help to sustain high growth and will protect the economy
from the volatility of international oil prices. As the Prime Minister recently indicated, the
authorities are preparing to launch a post- oil strategy and celebrate the country’s last barrel of
exported oil.

2
Fiscal Policy
5.
The authorities have undertaken a significant fiscal adjustment in 2015, amounting to
8.5 percent of non-hydrocarbon GDP, in order to adjust to the sharp drop in oil revenues.
They raised electricity and water tariffs and removed fuel subsidies by moving to a marketbased pricing of gasoline and diesel. The Abu Dhabi government also scaled back capital
transfers to Government-Related Entities (GREs) and reduced investment. Despite these
measures, an overall fiscal deficit emerged in 2015, equivalent to 2.1 percent of GDP. The
authorities’ plan is to reach a balanced budget by 2018 using conservative assumptions on oil
prices.
6.
As future oil prices remain highly uncertain, the authorities are proceeding with
further fiscal consolidation in 2016. A frontloaded adjustment is planned in the Emirate of
Abu Dhabi, and a slight consolidation is planned in the Emirate of Dubai and at the federal
level. The authorities aim to reduce the dependence of fiscal revenues on the hydrocarbon
sector and to diversify non-oil revenues. Plans for a value-added tax in the context of a GCCwide initiative at a rate of 5 percent are currently underway to be introduced in 2018, as well
as an increase in excise taxes on tobacco and alcohol and a tax on soft drinks. On the spending
side, the authorities plan to continue scaling back grants and capital transfers to GREs as well
as to stabilize the wage bill as a share of non-oil GDP. With regards to the additional fiscal
measures suggested by staff over the medium term, the authorities agree to gradually phase
out electricity, water, and gas subsides. They have also initiated a study to analyze the impact
of the introduction of a corporate income tax, which will be the basis for considering its
introduction, and possible timeline and rate. The authorities agree with staff that financing of
the fiscal deficit should include tapping the international capital markets or the sovereign
wealth funds while limiting drawing down government deposits in domestic banks. Indeed, in
April 2016, the Abu Dhabi government issued US$5 billion in Eurobonds to finance its
deficit, its first issuance since 2009.
7.
The authorities have made substantial progress in fiscal coordination and reporting and
have developed a fiscal framework at the federal level. The authorities plan to continue
strengthening fiscal coordination at the local level and to introduce a five- year federal fiscal
framework. Recently, the Dubai’s fiscal system has been electronically linked to that of the
federal government, and the Government Financial Policy Coordination Council is keen to
complete all electronic linking between federal and local systems. The Fiscal Coordination
Council will also continue to improve statistics collection and publication, and ensure better
policy coordination between different stakeholders. In addition, the Ministry of Finance (MoF)
recently signed a cooperation agreement with the UAE Central Bank (CBUAE) to enhance
cooperation in areas of monetary statistics and government financial, and banking
information.

3
8.
GREs have made considerable progress in restructuring and financing their debts by
making early repayments and lengthening maturity profiles. Accordingly, GRE financial
positions have strengthened due to its debt repayments ahead of schedule and are not cash
constrained. Nevertheless, the authorities will continue to monitor their activities and aim to
increase their transparency and disclosure policies. They have stepped up their oversight of
GREs’ investments and debt plans. It is worth noting in this regard the recent efforts by the
Dubai’s Supreme Fiscal Council and by the Abu Dhabi Debt Management Office to closely
review GREs’ debt issuance. In addition, bank exposure to GREs continues to be bound by
concentration risk limits set by the central bank.
Monetary and Financial Stability
9.
The exchange rate peg has served the UAE well and has been an important element of
stability for decades. The authorities agreed with staff that planned fiscal consolidation would
further bolster confidence in the stability of the exchange rate system.
10.
The CBUAE has been effective in preserving financial stability. The financial sector
continues to perform strongly, and the banking sector remains highly capitalized and
profitable, with a capital adequacy ratio largely exceeding the minimum requirement of
12 percent. The CBUAE will continue its close monitoring of the liquidity situation in the
banking system, which has been robust, and stands ready to provide liquidity support as
necessary. The central bank has ensured that credit risks are well provisioned before any
distribution of bank profits which contributed to strengthening capital buffers. It will continue
to monitor real estate markets and mortgage lending and stand ready to calibrate macroprudential measures if needed to strike the necessary balance between growth and financial
stability.
11.
The CBUAE regulatory and macro-prudential policies are aimed at preserving the
soundness of the financial sector. The new central bank and banking law is under preparation.
The revisions aim at enhancing central bank independence and governance, setting up a sound
institutional framework for financial stability oversight, and addressing shortcomings of safety
nets and resolution frameworks. The CBUAE is reviewing and updating existing regulations
to strengthen the prudential framework in line with the requirements of Basel III. In this
regard, they issued in 2015 a regulation on liquidity requirements and prepared a draft
regulation to phase in Basel III capital standards from 2016 onwards, with the expectation to
fully implement it by end-2018. In addition, new regulations have been developed covering
risk management and are currently under discussion with the banking sector. Moreover, the
authorities plan to review the regulatory framework for non-bank financial institutions and
will engage with different stakeholders by end-2016. The recent approval of a centralized
Shari’ah Board will provide the regulatory support to Islamic financial institutions by
ensuring consistency and clarity on Shari’ah governance of Islamic banks.

4
12.
Staff’s analysis and the CBUAE’s stress testing point to the resiliency of the banking
sector to severe shocks. Indeed, the CBUAE conducted a top-down solvency stress test to
assess the resilience of the banking system to a deterioration in credit quality. The results
suggested that few medium and small banks would be adversely affected. Moreover, all banks
would have liquidity coverage ratios above 100 percent in the liquidity risk stress testing. The
CBUAE is also working on establishing a financial stability stress index to identify possible
vulnerabilities and monitor risks in the banking system.
13.
Due to limited interconnectedness between the UAE and the UK financial systems, the
CBUAE does not expect to see a significant impact from the UK’s decision to leave the
European Union. Banks based in the UAE do not depend on foreign interbank markets to fund
their balance sheets, and their consolidated net foreign interbank position is positive.
Nevertheless, the CBUAE will continue to monitor unfolding developments from the Brexit
vote, and their implications for the UAE economy.
14.
The UAE authorities have continued to strengthen the AML/CFT framework and
address de-risking issues. In addition to adopting the by-law, they have upgraded the
regulatory requirements for banks and exchange houses, and improved the availability and use
of beneficial ownership information of legal persons established in the UAE and enhanced the
monitoring of cross-border financial flows. The Anti- Money Laundering and Suspicious
Cases Unit at the central bank will continue to strengthen the effectiveness of the AML/CFT
framework through capacity building and bolstering regional and international cooperation.
These efforts will help maintain financial integrity and prepare for the next round of mutual
evaluation of UAE’s AML/CFT framework scheduled for 2022. The authorities have also
taken concrete steps to conduct the AML/CFT national risk assessment and have asked for the
Fund’s technical assistance in this regard. On de-risking issues, the authorities are looking
forward to the Fund’s involvement to increase the awareness of concerned regulators and ease
capacity constraints, especially given its relevance to the region.
National Vision 2021 and Other Economic Reforms
15.
The UAE authorities have ambitious goals for further economic diversification and are
working to launch their roadmap to celebrate their last barrel of exported oil. In 2014, they
launched the national agenda to ensure the achievement of Vision 20211 by setting up
measurable objectives and monitoring their progress. The vision aims to make the UAE
among the best countries in the world in terms of global competitiveness and efficiency
among other indicators, in time for the Golden Jubilee of the UAE's establishment. The vision
focuses on the UAE becoming an important economic, touristic, and commercial center by
transitioning to a knowledge-based economy that promotes innovation, research, and
development. This will be based on further improvements in the country’s business-friendly

environment and its attractiveness to foreign investment. As of 2015, the country ranks in the
first place in government efficiency and holds the 17th position for global competitiveness.

The authorities are also planning to launch an initiative to double the manufacturing
sector’s share of the economy from 11 percent to 20 percent by 2025, by improving
innovation and promoting energy-efficient manufacturing. In addition, a number of clean and
renewable energy projects will be launched to enhance the country's competitiveness and
sustainability and preserve its environment for future generations. A Smart Government
Initiative “24/7/365” was also launched successfully in 2015. Finally, a new regulation aims to
increase women participation to 20 percent of members of the boards of listed companies, on
a “comply or explain” basis.

The authorities will continue to support the small and medium enterprises (SMEs)
which employ most of the labor force in the UAE. The central bank’s decision to set up a
work force for implementation of a strategy in support of SMEs, in coordination with the
relevant stakeholders as established by Law 2 of 2014, is a clear indication of the authorities’
commitment in this regard. In addition, the Ministerial Development Council has reviewed the
executive regulations for SMEs in order to enhance the potential of the sector and support
entrepreneurs in the country in line with the UAE Vision 2021. Following consultations, the
central bank is planning to issue new regulations to mobilize credit to the SME sector. The
new regulations will build on efforts to mitigate risks for entrepreneurs in the SME sector and
increase the share of the sector in banks’ lending, which will lead to further growth in the
business sector and encourage research and innovation. Finally, labor policy will continue to
focus on increasing the employment of nationals in the private sector.
