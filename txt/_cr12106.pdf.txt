STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 17, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context: The Swiss economy is fundamentally strong, but is facing a number of
challenges. Headwinds from the euro area debt crisis and a strong currency have
slowed growth, created deflationary pressures, and forced the central bank to abandon
the floating exchange rate regime. The financial sector is adapting to the new, more
stringent regulatory environment but remains vulnerable, including to a domestic
housing bubble. The fiscal position is sound, but pressures from population aging are
building.
Exchange Rate Policy: The exchange rate floor, seen as credible by the markets, has
halted appreciation and helped shore up the economy. Once growth recovers and
inflation reaches more comfortable levels, maintaining the exchange rate commitment
risks stoking inflation and hence a return to free floating would be desirable.
Financial sector: Though new regulatory requirements will result in strong capital
levels for Swiss SIFIs in the medium term, the transition period is long and large banks
are operating with low levels of high-quality capital and high leverage while global
financial markets are still unsettled. The risk of a real estate bubble has been
heightened by loose monetary conditions, and new macroprudential instruments are
under consideration to address this risk.
Fiscal policy: In case downside risks to growth materialize fiscal policy should support
aggregate demand, but space available under the fiscal rules is limited. Population
aging costs will put pressure on social security funds by the end of the decade in the
absence of reforms.

CONTEXT: A DIFFICULT PATH TO MACROECONOMIC
STABILITY DESPITE FUNDAMENTAL STRENGTH
1.
While the Swiss economy is
fundamentally strong, ensuring
macroeconomic stability has been
challenging. Switzerland is a very open, highly
productive, innovative economy, with many
successful global companies, a highly skilled
workforce and an increasingly open and
flexible labor market. Medium-term growth
has been good, unemployment is low, there is
a track record of low and stable inflation, the
public finances are in better shape than in
most advanced countries, and the external
position is healthy, with a large positive net
foreign asset position and current account
surplus. Yet, just four years ago, the global
financial crisis affected the Swiss economy

deeply through the exposure of its large and
globalized financial sector. That crisis was
ultimately successfully managed, but now
macroeconomic stability is being threatened
once again by the ramifications of the euro
zone crisis. Safe-haven capital inflows from the
euro zone turmoil pushed the exchange rate to
new heights last summer, just as slower global
economic activity was curtailing export growth.
To protect the economy, the central bank
moved away from the long-standing floating
regime and committed to an exchange rate
floor. A carefully-charted and well-coordinated
set of policies is needed to ensure
macroeconomic and financial stability in this
new framework.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. GDP Growth is Falling and Inflation is Negative with the Exchange Rate
at New Heights
2.
At end-2011, the Swiss economy
decelerated sharply from a strong recovery,
driven by lower domestic demand and net
exports. After registering a brisk output
expansion of 2.7 percent in 2010, the growth
momentum tailed off in the second half
of 2011, in line with other advanced
economies. GDP growth fell from 0.4 percent
q-o-q in 2011Q1 to 0.1 percent in Q4 with the
economy growing by 1.9 percent for the year.
Despite the real income growth, consumption
was surprisingly weak, possibly reflecting
statistical difficulties in accounting for larger

cross-border shopping.1 With the rapid
appreciation of the exchange rate, growth in
exports of goods and services halved but
remained positive.

1

Cross-border shopping and private imports via
courier and mail are very tentatively estimated at 1214 CHF billion in 2011. Tax revenue collected on some
cross-border shopping flows shows an increase of a
third in 2011. If this rate of growth is applied to the
total and used to re-estimate the rate of growth of
private consumption growth, this rate would go from
0.9 percent to 1.6 percent.

3.
While unemployment is low, the
labor market is expected to weaken. After
rebounding from the 2009 recession, the
official unemployment rate fell to around
3 percent in 2011, well below that of most
other European countries. The slowdown in
economic activity is expected to drive the
unemployment rate higher, especially in
industries hit by the strong franc such as the
mechanical and electrical engineering sector
and tourism. A decline in employment may
also occur in the financial sector, where
shrinking value added has so far not been
matched by workforce reduction.

operations, the non-renewal of maturing SNB
Bills, as well as the repurchase of outstanding
SNB Bills. As pressures continued, on
September 6 the bank announced that it
would defend a floor of 1.2 Swiss francs per
euro, thus abandoning the floating exchange
rate regime. The new policy has successfully
stabilized the nominal exchange rate so far
(Selected Issues Paper “Unprecedented
Currency Appreciation and Policy Response”).
The real exchange rate has depreciated by
about 11 percent since the introduction of the
floor, thus undoing about one third of the
cumulative appreciation since 2007.

4.
Inflation is in negative territory,
driven by declining import prices. In March,
headline inflation dropped to -1 percent y-o-y,
while core inflation was below -1 percent
because of the pass-through from the strong
currency. Despite the current negative price
growth, the latest survey shows that inflation
expectations are firmly anchored in low but
positive territory. In its March Monetary Policy
Assessment, the SNB forecasted moderate
deflation in 2012 and moderate inflation
afterwards.

6.
Weak foreign demand and the
effects of real appreciation have made a
dent in export revenues in the second
semester, but the current account surplus
remains large. Notwithstanding the
slowdown in export growth, the watch-making
and, to a smaller degree, the pharmaceutical
industries have been buoyant. The net balance
of services trade was strong even though
tourism and bank financial services have
performed poorly, thanks in part to good
results in the commodity trading sector. All in
all, in 2011 the current account continued to
register a large surplus of 14.8percent of GDP
despite the large real exchange rate
appreciation.2

5.
Currency appreciation following
intensified safe haven inflows in the
summer was halted by the introduction of a
floor on the exchange rate. The Swiss franc
has been on an upward trend since 2008,
reflecting unwinding of carry trades and, more
recently, intensified safe haven capital inflows
triggered by the euro area debt crisis. The
CHF/euro rate went from 1.6 in late 2007 to
almost parity in early August 2011, with a
cumulative real effective appreciation of over
30 percent. The appreciation was especially
rapid in July 2011, as the euro zone crisis
intensified. In early August, the SNB responded
through a massive liquidity expansion, carried
out through foreign exchange swap

7.
Balance of payment statistics likely
overstate the true economic size of the
current account. The foreign-owned
component of the retained earnings of Swiss
multinationals and the Swiss-owned
component of the retained earnings of foreign
multinationals are not captured by balance of
payment statistics. The SNB estimates the net

effect of correcting for those biases would
reduce the current account balance by about
5 percent of GDP in 2011. In addition, crossborder shopping is largely unaccounted for in
import statistics, which further distorts the
current account balance upwards. Although
the precise size of the underestimate is difficult
to gauge, it may have been of the order of
2 percent of GDP in 2011. Nevertheless, the
Swiss current account surplus still stands out
as sizable relative to other economies that are
not commodity exporters even if these factors
are taken into account.
8.
The Swiss franc is moderately
overvalued. The Swiss franc is high based on
historical values and purchasing power parity
comparisons. On the other hand, the external

position is strong, and has been resilient to the
recent appreciation, with the export sector as a
whole holding up well, though some
subsectors are undoubtedly suffering.
Applying the CGER methodologies to the
latest WEO projections yields an overvaluation
of 0–15 percent. The top end of the range
reflects the equilibrium real exchange rate
approach, while the lower end reflects the two
methods based on the CA balance. Adjusting
the medium-term current account projections
by the overestimate identified by the SNB, the
CGER calculations yield a misalignment of
about 10 percent. This evidence, therefore,
points to a moderate overvaluation of the
Swiss franc. 3

B. The Fiscal Position is Anchored by Fiscal Rules and Discipline but Faces
Pressures from Population Aging
9.
Switzerland’s fiscal policy is well
anchored in fiscal rules and a culture of
fiscal discipline. Most prominently, at the 3
federal level a “debt brake rule” mandates a
structurally balanced budget. In addition, at
the subnational level, most cantons have fiscal
rules, albeit with varying strength. More
broadly, the design of intergovernmental fiscal
relations, a no-bailout presumption for
cantons and municipalities, and considerable
subnational tax autonomy create strong
incentives to accept and comply with fiscal

3

Since the cumulative real appreciation since 2008 has
been of about 20 percent, this assessment implies that
the real exchange rate was undervalued by about 10
percent at end-2007, when the currency began to
strengthen.

rules and foster a general culture of fiscal
discipline (Box 1 and Annex II).
10.
The fiscal position is healthy and
government debt low, with a broadly
neutral stance projected for 2012. The
general government balance, which stayed in
positive territory in the 2009 recession,
continued to register a surplus in 2011
(estimated at 1/2 percent of GDP on a GFSM
basis). In particular, social security swung back
into surplus due to reforms to unemployment
insurance and a VAT increase earmarked for
financing invalidity pensions. In contrast, the
federal government surplus disappeared,
reflecting in part measures to counteract the
effects of the strong Swiss currency (some

0.15 percent of GDP) introduced in
August 2011. The projected fiscal stance
in 2012 and beyond is broadly neutral, with a
small deficit at the federal level compensated
by surpluses in the other components of
general government. The debt-to-GDP ratio is
projected to fall further to some 45 percent of
GDP in 2015 (on a GFSM-basis).
11.
However, fiscal policy faces longerterm challenges from population aging
and there are contingent liabilities from
the financial sector. Without reforms, the
increase in public aging-related expenditure
will start to bite in earnest around the end of

SWITZERLAND

the decade and is projected by the authorities
at some 4 percent of GDP by 2050. This
increase is about equally distributed between
the pay-as-you-go pension pillar and the
health care system (including long-term
care).3 In addition, several second-pillar
pension funds (of public entities) have a
public guarantee and are partly underfunded,
while almost all cantonal banks benefit from
an unrestricted guarantee from their
respective canton. Furthermore, in a tail risk
scenario of a severe global financial crisis,
government support to the financial sector
may become necessary.

Box 1. Switzerland: Fiscal Discipline in a Federal System1
Switzerland is a confederation with highly
decentralized public finances, including
considerable sub-national tax autonomy. All
government levels have demonstrated
remarkable fiscal discipline. This success rests
on two pillars: streamlined intergovernmental
fiscal relations with a no-bail-out presumption,
and effective fiscal rules at each level of
government.4
Intergovernmental fiscal relations, reformed
in 2008, feature a rationalized system of task
assignments with clear responsibilities across
government levels as well as a simplified and
rules-based fiscal equalization scheme. The
system ensures a close connection between

spending decisions and the responsibility for
their financing. Equally crucial is a well-tested
and deeply-engrained presumption that lower
government levels will not be bailed out by the
Confederation in case of financial difficulties.
Together, these factors limit any deficit bias in
the system.
These characteristics also create the basis for
the acceptance of and compliance with fiscal
rules both at the federal and cantonal level. In
addition, these rules avoid over-complexity and
are hence tractable both from a technical and
political economy perspective.

C. The financial sector is restructuring while risks are building up in the
mortgage market
12.
The very large and internationally
exposed financial sector is a source of risk
to the economy, but new legislation will
force systemically important banks (SIBs)
to hold more capital than peers. After one
of the large banks was rescued in 2008, the
authorities addressed the TBTF problem in
Switzerland through a new legislative package
centered on significantly higher capital
requirements for systemic banks. The TBTF
legislation, which came into effect in March,
requires SIBs to hold a minimum 10 percent
Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio
and 19 percent Total Capital, well above Basel
III standards. 5 The new standards will be fully
phased in by 2019. The legislation also
mandates SIBs to make progress toward
increasing resolvability.
13.
After a marked improvement
in 2010, the performance of the two large
banks worsened in 2011. In response to the
new regulatory environment, the two large
banks are restructuring their activities by
reducing risk-weighted assets and increasing
reliance on client-driven revenues and feebased services. In 2011, as financial market
turbulence and low customer activity hurt
investment banking revenue, the two large
Swiss banks lagged behind other global SIFIs
in overall income generation. Although asset
quality is better than peers, at over 80 percent
the cost/income ratio is comparatively high
and it has been negatively affected by the
currency appreciation. All in all, profitability

plunged in 2011, with ROA falling by
40 percent to less than 0.3 percent and ROE
dropping from double digits to below
7 percent.6 On the other hand, CDS spreads
remain significantly below those of peers,
suggesting that markets see Swiss large
banks as relatively well positioned to
withstand current financial turmoil.
14.
Although they comfortably fulfill
current regulatory capital requirements,
large banks have a thin layer of high
quality capital. The two large banks have an
average Tier I capital ratio of 15 percent and
core Tier I capital ratio of 12 percent, well
above the average of other global SIFI peers
(12 percent and 10 percent respectively)7.
However, because these ratios are computed
under Basel II (or Basel 2.5 rules), they include
low quality capital such as deferred tax assets
and hybrids, which would not be available to
absorb losses in a crisis, and assign low risk
weights to certain exposures.8 Based on a
more stringent capital quality indicator such
as the ratio of tangible common equity to
tangible assets (TCE), the large Swiss banks
are below peers and have made little progress
since 2009. Thus, significant progress will
have to be made to satisfy the new, more

Large Swiss banks are also facing elevated legal risks
related to legacy assets, customer tax compliance, and,

Under Basel III rules, risk weights on trading book,

Banks’ liquidity profile has
improved, but dependence on wholesale
funding remains elevated. Swiss large banks
have loan/deposit ratios below peers and
share of liquid assets comparable to peers,
and comply with the Swiss liquidity
requirement mandating them to be able to
cover liquidity needs over a 30-day horizon
under stress. However, the banks may still be
especially vulnerable to disruptions in
wholesale funding markets over a longer
horizon, as their reliance on wholesale
funding stands at over 70 percent, while peers
have reduced this dependence to less than
60 percent. One of the large banks relies
particularly heavily on money market funds
for its U.S. dollar funding.9
16.
Domestic mortgage credit and real
estate prices continue to rise briskly,
heightening the risk that a bubble may be
forming. With short-term interest rates close
to zero and abundant liquidity, mortgage
rates have fallen to historic lows (about

Although average price growth seems
contained relative to other countries, housing
prices are high relative to income and there
are signs of overheating in “hot spots” (such
as the Geneva, Zurich, and Zug areas) and
market segments (condominiums), as well as
evidence of loose lending policies in some
banks.
17.
Domestically-oriented banks and
insurance companies are exposed to the
housing market. Aggressive mortgage
lending and more reliance on fixed-rate
longer maturity mortgages have increased
interest rate and credit risk, especially for
cooperative banks and cantonal banks,
although there is a large variation among
individual banks and among bank categories.
The insurance sector is also exposed to the
Swiss real estate market (14 percent of total
assets). The authorities have warned about
the financial stability risks associated with
mortgage lending since 2010.

This funding structure partly reflects the banks’
business model and their large U.S. operations. During
the last financial crisis, large banks received liquidity
support through the SNB, which could provide funding
in U.S. dollars thanks to a swap line with the U.S.
Federal Reserve.

Recent tax developments have put
the private banking industry under
pressure. An international push to broaden
cross-border cooperation in tax compliance is
challenging long-standing bank secrecy
principles and practices in the Swiss private
banking industry. In an effort to address
legacy issues and improve tax transparency,
Switzerland has signed several withholding tax
agreements with other countries, including
most recently with Austria and the U.K.
In 2011, a number of Swiss banks (including
one of the two SIBs) have been placed under
investigation in the U.S. for allegedly helping
clients evade taxes; one small bank in this
group has been indicted and broke itself up
preemptively. To help bring about a
settlement, the Swiss parliament recently
broadened the scope of administrative
assistance offered to U.S. tax authorities under
the double taxation agreement (whose
ratification is, however, still pending in the
U.S.). Following these developments, the Swiss
wealth management business has seen
outflows from European countries and the U.S.,
which have been partly offset by inflows from
other countries. An additional development
which might have an impact on the sector is
the recent revision of the FATF standards
which included tax crimes among the money
laundering offenses. Some consolidation is
expected to take place in the sector.

19.
Insurance companies are coping
with the low interest rate environment,
strong competition, and natural
catastrophes. Premiums for life, non-life, and
reinsurance companies have grown
moderately in 2011, but underwriting results
are still weak. Low interest rates affect Swiss
life insurance companies more than other
European competitors because they have
more traditional business. To reduce pressure,
the guaranteed payout rate on life insurance
policies (the BVG) was lowered to 1.5 percent
from the beginning of 2012 after remaining at
2 percent for three years, but this has not
been enough to narrow the gap with falling
government bond yields. Among nonlife
insurers, strong competition has put pressure
on rates, while high claims related to natural
catastrophes weakened the underwriting
results of reinsurers in 2011. To boost
financial results, some insurers have
continued to rely on reserve releases.
Insurers’ exposure to euro area countries
under market scrutiny appears moderate. The
full implementation of the Swiss Solvency
Test (SST) has improved awareness of risk
sources and enhanced understanding of
profit and risk drivers and guarantees. All
nonlife insurers and reinsurers and the
majority of life insurers passed the 2011 SST.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
The Central Scenario is Benign, but Risks Are Sizable
20.
The economy is expected to
stagnate in 2012 and regain momentum
in 2013. In the near term, flagging demand
abroad and the lagged effects of past
appreciation will continue to slow exports and
investment, while subdued employment
growth will further weaken household
disposable income and private consumption.
GDP growth is expected to register at
0.8 percent in 2012, picking up steam in 2013
as the contractionary effect of the exchange
rate appreciation peters out. 10 In line with the
WEO baseline scenario of a subdued global
recovery, GDP growth should reach 1.7 percent
and strengthen thereafter. With the exchange
rate pass-through receding over time, positive
growth in domestic good prices, and firmly
anchored inflation expectations, the risk of an
entrenched deflation is limited.
21.
Risks to the outlook mainly relate to
euro area developments and the large
financial sector (Box 2). Swiss banks have
foreign claims accounting for more than
60 percent of bank assets or three times GDP,
the highest among advanced economies. They
are most exposed to the U.S. and the U.K.,
while exposures to euro area countries under
market scrutiny are moderate.11 However, the
10

A VAR analysis suggests that the output response to
REER shocks is relatively quick, peaking after two
quarters (Annex III).

11

According to BIS data, the direct exposure of Swiss
banks and major insurance companies to Greece,
Ireland, Portugal, Italy, Spain, and Belgium accounts
for two percent of total assets. Although the direct
exposure is moderate relative to total assets, it is much
higher relative to GDP (5 percent).

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

economy has close trade ties with the euro
zone, so an intensification of the confidence
crisis in the region would trigger an adverse
trade shock that might tip the economy into a
recession. A worsening euro area crisis would
also likely accelerate safe haven capital flows
into Switzerland putting the currency under
pressure. If the floor was abandoned and the
exchange rate appreciated, large bank losses
on direct exposures to euro area countries
would be aggravated by exchange rate
movements given the currency mismatch in
the banks’ cost/revenue structure; the crisis
would also have the knock-on effect of
dampening investment banking and wealth
management business. In a tail risk scenario of
a severe euro zone crisis, the Swiss economy
would likely be dragged into a more serious
and protracted recession than in 2009. A
possible freeze in global wholesale funding
markets, upon which the two large Swiss banks
are heavily reliant, would compound the real
shock.
22.
In addition, a “boom-bust” pattern
in the real estate market would strongly
affect domestically-oriented banks and the
insurance sector. Given their large exposures,
both sectors would suffer should a housing
price bubble develop and then burst.
Difficulties for the insurance sector would likely
spill over to banks, as bank financing is
partially provided by insurance firms,
reinforcing the adverse spiral.
The authorities’ view
23.
The authorities were somewhat
more sanguine than staff with regards to

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

the baseline scenario, but shared staff’s
assessment of the main risk factors. Growth
was seen as weak in 2012 in spite of recent
signs of stabilization, with a somewhat
stronger rebound in 2013 compared to staff
(GDP growth of 1.8–2.1 percent). The
difference was largely due to the authorities’

SWITZERLAND

more optimistic assumptions on the external
environment. The authorities agreed with staff
that downward pressures on inflation would be
contained under the baseline scenario, as price
declines have not spread to nontraded goods
or wages.

The Swiss financial sector has
moderate direct exposures to euro

both banking and insurance have
complex balance sheets and are
heavily interconnected, so losses
through indirect exposures cannot
be ruled out. Small cushion of high
quality capital in bank SIFIs is a
concern. Disruptions in wholesale
funding markets could cause
liquidity problems.

may be needed.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Overview
24.
With a relatively benign central
scenario, macroeconomic policies should
focus on reducing vulnerabilities to the
several risk factors that cloud the horizon.
Under the baseline scenario, output will be
close to potential in 2012 and thereafter, and
inflation will go back to historical levels
by 2013. Against this background, the return
to a floating exchange rate and more neutral
monetary stance needs to be well-timed and
carefully orchestrated to avoid sparking
inflationary pressures or fueling a new round
of excessive currency appreciation. In the

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

meantime, the risk of unstable housing price
developments has to be kept in check
through macroprudential tools, new and
untried instruments in the Swiss context. As
monetary policy has reached its limits,
possible new external recessionary impulses
will need to be addressed through fiscal
policy, by making effective use of the limited
available space under the fiscal rules. In the
financial sector, risks from a turbulent external
environment call into question the current,
protracted timetable for transitioning to new
regulatory standards.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

SWITZERLAND

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies—Safeguarding Credibility
25.
The introduction of the exchange
rate floor was an appropriate policy
response to the risk of economic
contraction and deflation. In the summer
of 2011, with the economy slowing down
rapidly, negative inflation, and uncertainty in
the euro area spurring capital inflows and
pushing the exchange rate to historic heights,
the risk was sizable that continuing exchange
rate appreciation might lead to entrenched
deflation and a recession. Furthermore,
alternative policy options were limited, with
interest rates at the zero bound, fiscal policy
governed by the debt brake rule, and
quantitative easing constrained by the small
size of the domestic bond market (Selected
Issues Paper and Box 3).
26.
The new strategy has successfully
stabilized the exchange rate so far on the
strength of the credibility of the SNB
commitment. Available data suggests that
very little if any intervention has been needed
to maintain the floor, as the SNB commitment
successfully curbed speculative bets on further
Swiss franc appreciation and reduced the
attractiveness of Swiss-franc denominated
assets as safe haven investments. This
contrasts with the limited effectiveness of
previous foreign exchange interventions.
Sizable inflation differential with major trading
partners, if sustained, will continue to reduce
the real exchange rate overvaluation.

27.
The currency should be allowed to
float freely again once inflation goes back
to comfortable levels and growth picks up.
While the economy is stagnant and inflation is
forecasted to remain too low, the exchange
rate floor helps to protect the economy from
further contractionary pressures. In this
situation, if capital inflows intensified, then
intervention to defend the floor would
appropriately result in a more expansionary
monetary stance. On the other hand, once
growth rekindles and inflation returns to
normal levels, delaying the return to a freely
floating currency could carry the risk of stoking
inflation, in case money supply had to be
expanded pro-cyclically to absorb renewed
capital inflows. In such a situation, the
willingness of the SNB to do “whatever it
takes” to enforce the floor might be called into
question.
The authorities’ view
28.
The SNB viewed the exchange rate
floor as an emergency measure, and hence
temporary in nature. Concerning exit, the
bank considered that the most favorable
scenario was one in which, as the economic
situation stabilized, the exchange rate
weakened and traded above the floor. On the
other hand, an exit while the floor continued
to bind would be more difficult and would
have to be carefully managed.

Box 3. The Swiss Response to Capital Inflows: Lessons for Other Countries? 1
The introduction of the exchange rate floor by the
SNB last September has stabilized the exchange
rate and the economy so far. Should other
countries with currency appreciation pressures
follow in the SNB’s footsteps? Several
considerations suggest that other countries
should be careful to emulate the Swiss approach,
particularly where macroeconomic conditions,
initial policy stance, and policy levers differ
substantially from those of Switzerland:
1.
It is too early to judge whether the
exhange rate floor has been a complete success,
as a smooth return to normal monetary policy has
not yet been accomplished.
2.
The floor was introduced in an
environment where the risk of a sharp contraction
and deflation was significant. If capital inflows and
exchange rate pressure occur against the
background of above-target inflation, loose fiscal
policy, and strong

domestic demand, a commitment to defend an
exchange rate floor through unlimited monetary
expansion would not be desirable or, most likely,
credible: in these circumstances, defending the
floor would exacerbate macroeconomic
imbalances.
3.
Even if exchange rate pressures occur
where inflation is low and aggregate demand is
weak, alternative policy tools may be available.
Many countries have room to lower domestic
nominal interest rates to discourage inflows; even
with the policy rate at zero, quantitative easing or
fiscal policy can be used to stimulate aggregate
demand; and capital flow management measures
might be considered. In Switzerland, interest rates
are close to zero, quantitative easing is precluded
by the small size of the domestic bond market;
discretionary fiscal policy is constrained by fiscal
rules; and capital flow management measures
would be complex to design and costly given the
country’s role as an international financial center.

C. Containing Risks in the Mortgage Market—An Appropriate
Macroprudential Toolkit
29.
Overheating in the real estate
market may hurt the economy and
endanger the current monetary framework.
With the new exchange rate policy, the SNB’s
willingness to expand liquidity unboundedly to
fulfill its exchange rate commitment is
fundamental to credibility. If signs that
abundant liquidity was fuelling a housing
18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

bubble were to emerge, this willingness might
be called into question, threatening the
framework.
30.
To ward against this risk, monitoring
and supervision in the mortgage market are
being stepped up. During the 2011
consultation, staff stressed the need to move

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

beyond traditional Swiss bank self-regulation
in the mortgage market. The authorities have
recently strengthened monitoring and
supervision in this area, including through a
new survey of lending practices and new, more
precise guidelines for mortgage lending. These
guidelines are adopted by the industry but
approved and monitored by the supervisor
(FINMA).
31.
A proposal to introduce new
macroprudential instruments has been put
forward. A joint working group of the Federal
Department of Finance (FDF), FINMA, and the
SNB has proposed to amend the bank capital
ordinance to implement early the countercyclical capital buffer (CCB) contemplated
under Basel III. The buffer would be activated
by the Federal Council upon request of the
SNB and after consultation with FINMA. Banks
would then have up to 12 months to raise their
capital level. In addition, the working group
proposed to improve the classification of risk
weights in mortgage lending by taking into
account the debtor’s risk profile and assigning
a 100 percent weight to high risk exposures.
Finally, under the proposal the SNB’s would be
given power to request information from
banks when such information is not already
available from FINMA.
32.
The preventive power of the
envisaged macroprudential measures would
be strengthened by adding minimum
affordability ratios to the toolkit. With most
domestically-oriented banks comfortably
meeting current regulatory capital
requirements, the proposed CCB and new risk
weights will likely result in a small increase in
mortgage interest rates which might not
discourage imprudent lending and borrowing
behavior when interest rates are at historical
lows. Hence, instruments that more directly

SWITZERLAND

address such behaviors could usefully be
added to the toolkit. One such instrument is a
minimum affordability ratio, forbidding
mortgages with debt service-to-income (DTI)
ratios above a certain threshold. Loan-to-value
(LTV) ratios could also be considered, but may
require supervisory monitoring of real estate
valuations to ensure that these valuations are
not inflated by overly optimistic estimates.12 In
addition, the envisaged activation process for
the CCB could usefully be streamlined to
ensure that the instrument can be deployed
sufficiently quickly.
33.
Broader reforms to reduce or
eliminate the preferential tax treatment of
mortgage debt service should be
considered. As in other countries, in
Switzerland mortgage interest payments are
deductible from taxable income, so that
households have incentives to increase
mortgage debt. Homeowners are taxed on the
imputed rents from their property (net of
maintenance expenses), so a reduction in the
tax benefit from mortgages would have to be
balanced by a change in the taxation of
imputed rents. 13
The authorities’ view
34.
The authorities were confident that
the planned macroprudential tools would
have some preventive effects, and rejected
affordability limits as too “market
unfriendly.” The authorities noted that the
need to set aside more capital would
12

DTI and LTV ratios have been used, for example, in
Canada, Hong Kong SAR, Korea, the Netherlands, and
Norway. For a review of experiences, see “How to Deal
with Real Estate Booms,” IMF WP 11/91.

Report on Switzerland.

SWITZERLAND

discourage mortgage growth, though they
acknowledged that domestically-oriented
banks were mostly well capitalized. They also
noted that the measures would build buffers in
the banking sector to absorb potential
mortgage-related losses. Introducing

affordability limits, on the other hand, would
be equivalent to forbidding certain types of
mortgages, an excessive restriction of private
contracting freedom. The likelihood that
reforms of housing taxation would muster the
necessary political support was seen as low.

D. Reducing Financial Vulnerabilities
35.
More rapid implementation of Basel
III and TBTF capital requirements is
warranted. The two large Swiss banks, are still
weakly capitalized relative to peers in terms of
high-quality capital while they face sizable
risks, such as direct and indirect exposures to
the euro zone crisis, legal contingent liabilities,
and exposure to the Swiss mortgage market. In
addition, heavy reliance on wholesale funding
is a vulnerability factor. Thus, it will be
important for banks to build capital more
rapidly, including by restricting cash
distributions and raising external capital as
early as feasible, as subdued profitability
prospect makes it challenging to rely on
retained earnings only. While raising capital in
current market conditions may be costly, in a
stress scenario this cost would likely become
prohibitive, while market discipline would
require banks to improve their capitalization
rapidly. Banks have moved ahead with
issuance of contingent capital (CoCos);
however, the loss-absorbing capacity of these
instruments remains untested.14
36.
There is progress on bank
resolvability, a key plank of the TBTF
strategy. The new TBTF legislation requires
14

So far, three Swiss banks have successfully issued
CoCos with differing convertibility or write-down
features.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SIBs to prepare a recovery and resolution plan
to ensure the continuity of systemically
important functions in Switzerland in case of
financial distress. The legislation also creates
incentives for banks to make further progress
toward global resolvability, as such progress
may result in rebates on capital requirements.
The size of the rebates will depend on
progress in achieving structural, financial, and
operational unbundling. The SIBs will also be
affected by new resolvability requirement in
the U.S. and U.K., where they have large
operations, and recovery and resolution plans
will be evaluated by supervisors in all three
countries. Progress has been made in
upgrading the Swiss bank resolution
framework, where reforms will grant FINMA
new powers to intervene distressed banks.
37.
Microprudential supervision is being
upgraded, but reliance on external auditors
remains a problem. FINMA has adopted a
risk-based approach in all areas of supervision
and increased on-site reviews and regulatory
audits. However, the outsourcing of
supervisory work to auditors (hired by the
banks) is still prevalent. In addition, a costly
“rogue trader” scandal at one of the SIBs last
fall has highlighted the need to enhance the
oversight of risk management and internal
controls of large banks. Resources should be
further expanded to broaden FINMA’s inhouse supervisory capacity.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

38.
In the insurance sector,
implementation of the Swiss Solvency Test
(SST) by all insurers and reinsurers should
improve risk management. Given pressures
from strong competition and low interest
rates, it is important to ensure the proper
operation of the SST for all insurers. In 2011,
FINMA rendered about 30 decisions on
internal model approval requests, with full
approval granted in 25 percent of the cases.
The supervisory agency is also focusing efforts
on less transparent intra-group transactions in
order to identify and eliminate unlimited
guarantees. In light of the relatively high level
of intra-group balances, the oversight of intragroup connections needs to be strengthened
to contain contagion risk arising from
significant or undesirable transactions.
The authorities’ view
39.
The authorities recognize that large
banks remain thinly capitalized but are
confident that progress under the new
regulatory framework will be adequate. The
authorities agreed that fast progress was
desirable, were closely monitoring bank capital
building progress, and were ready to act if
banks did not fulfill the new requirements as
they came into force. They also expected

SWITZERLAND

market discipline to put pressure on banks to
move faster, and noted that forcing more
transparent bank reporting of capital adequacy
according to the full Basel III standards would
foster such discipline. They also considered
that CoCos would help mitigate the risk of low
capitalization, as these instruments would be
loss-absorbing. The authorities underscored
the importance of rapid progress towards
resolvability, acknowledged the complexity of
the issue in a global context, and stressed that
the Swiss approach was to put the banks in
charge of devising convincing solutions. On
supervision, they noted that there was
ongoing progress in building up in-house
capacity, but also pointed out that reliance on
external auditors allowed for the flexibility of
quickly putting into place supervisory capacity
in specific areas. Finally, on risk management,
FINMA has asked large banks to assess
internal control procedure to prevent
unauthorized trading against prudent
practices, and will take action if needed.

E. Fiscal Policies—Standing Ready for Cyclical Support and Reforming
Aging-Related Spending
40.
The fiscal stance is appropriately
neutral given growth prospects, but fiscal
policy should be ready to support
aggregate demand to the extent feasible
under fiscal rules if the outlook
deteriorates. From a longer-term perspective,
fiscal policy should be conservative in light of

population aging and financial sector risks
(including from guarantees for cantonal banks
and public pension funds). However, available
leeway under the fiscal rules and additional
room that may emerge during budget
implementation should be used to prop up
aggregate demand in case the envisaged
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

SWITZERLAND

recovery stalls in the course of the year. Fiscal
multipliers are estimated to be similar to those
of other advanced small open economies (see
Annex IV).
41.
Rapid progress in tackling the cost
of an aging population is needed and
automatic adjustors (“fiscal rules”) for
pensions would be useful. Given the long
gestation periods associated with the related
reforms, time is running out quickly.
Specifically in the pension system, equalization
of the male and female retirement age and
pension indexation to inflation only (rather
than both inflation and wages) should be
considered. In addition, automatic adjustors of
the pension age and/or benefits to life
expectancy would be a useful tool to reduce
the need for repeated and often difficult
reform discussions. Furthermore, as regards
health care, recent reforms, including with
respect to hospital financing, are welcome and
should be carefully monitored. A further
strengthening of coordination mechanisms,
including across government levels, could
facilitate the design of additional measures.
The authorities’ view
42.
The authorities expressed skepticism
about discretionary fiscal policy. They noted
that the philosophy behind the debt brake rule
is to eschew discretionary fiscal policy, and

emphasized the built-in role of automatic
stabilizers. This determination was confirmed
by the reluctance by parliament to go beyond
the fiscal measures for mitigating appreciation
effects introduced in August 2011. From a
practical perspective, feasible timely and
targeted projects would be difficult to find, in
particular infrastructure projects would not be
advisable given the high degree of capacity
utilization in the construction sector.
43.
On aging costs, the authorities
concurred with the case for additional
reforms, but were concerned about the
political acceptability of automatic benefit
adjustors, which may take discretion away
from the political process. As a potential
alternative, they mentioned a stipulation
mandating the government to pass reforms in
case of financial imbalances in the social
security funds, e.g. when the liquidity reserves
of the public pay-as-you-go pillar fall below a
certain percentage of annual expenditure. In
parallel, temporary benefit and/or contribution
measures to ensure liquidity would come into
force (e.g. the suspension and/or
postponement of the regular pension
increases in line with inflation and/or wages).
This would build pressure for a political
consensus on more fundamental reforms while
still keeping discretion about how such
reforms should look like.

STAFF APPRAISAL
44.
The economy is well positioned to
return to moderate growth in the second
part of this year, but uncertainty is high. As
global demand picks up and the tradable
sector adjusts to the new level of the exchange
rate, output growth should recover in the
22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

second part of the year, with the output gap
remaining close to zero and unemployment
increasing modestly. Inflation should turn
positive once exchange rate pass-through
effects peter out. Possible financial sector
ramifications of sovereign and banking sector

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

fragilities in the euro zone are the main
downside risk.
45.
The introduction of the exchange
rate floor in September 2011 was
appropriate in light of risks. With economic
indicators pointing downwards, negative
inflation, and uncertainty in the euro area
spurring capital inflows and pushing the
exchange rate to historic heights, continuing
exchange rate appreciation might have caused
entrenched deflation and a recession.
Furthermore, alternative policy options were
limited, with interest rates at the zero bound,
discretionary fiscal policy limited by the debt
brake rule, and quantitative easing constrained
by the small size of the domestic bond market.
The SNB exchange rate commitment, which is
seen as credible by the markets, has stabilized
the currency and is thus helping shore up the
economy.
46.
Once economic conditions
normalize, a return to a freely floating
currency would be desirable. While the
exchange rate floor has been successful, once
an economic recovery gets under way and
deflation risks recede the SNB should move
back to a free float. Delaying exit would carry
the risk of stoking inflation, especially in case
money supply had to be expanded procyclically to absorb renewed capital inflows. A
strong economy and resurgent inflation might
also undermine the credibility of the
commitment to defend the floor.
47.
The current fiscal stance is
appropriate but would need to be loosened
if support for the still fragile economic
growth is needed. From a longer term
perspective, a conservative fiscal policy is
appropriate in view of potential fiscal risks
related to the financial sector (including

SWITZERLAND

cantonal banks and public pension funds) and
the cost of an aging population. In the short
term, the current broadly neutral stance is
appropriate. However, in case the envisaged
recovery stalls it would be advisable to use
countercyclically the limited leeway available
under the fiscal rules.
48.
In parallel, measures to tackle the
financial consequences of population aging
should gain center stage and include
additional “fiscal rules”. Under unchanged
policies, the increase in aging-related
expenditure will already start to bite in earnest
around the end of this decade. Consequently,
time for reform preparation and
implementation is running out quickly.
Specifically, a “fiscal rule” that automatically
links the retirement age and/or pension
benefits to life expectancy could usefully be
introduced. Such a rule would reduce the need
for repeated and often difficult reform
discussions.
49.
Rapid implementation of Basel III
and TBTF capital requirements as well as
progress on bank resolvability are
paramount. The TBTF legislation, recently
approved by Parliament, will substantially raise
the requirements for high quality capital in
systemically important banks and is welcome,
but it has a relatively long implementation
period. Although this is in line with Basel III, it
may be particularly detrimental in the case of
the two large Swiss banks, because of their
high vulnerability to risks that were not
sufficiently recognized under Basel II and
heavy reliance on low quality capital that will
be phased out under the new rules. Thus,
during the transition rapid progress to
strengthen the quantity and quality of capital
in large banks is needed, especially in light of
the continued fragilities in the global financial
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

SWITZERLAND

system. In parallel, since more capital alone
cannot fully eliminate TBTF risk, progress
toward improving bank resolvability should
continue.
50.
A broad set of macroprudential
instruments is urgently needed to address
rising mortgage market risks. Since
monetary conditions might remain loose for
some time, the risk that a bubble may form is
intensifying. Stepped up monitoring and
supervision will help contain risks in
domestically-oriented banks, where mortgage
loan concentration is high. The Basel III
counter-cyclical capital buffer and higher risk
weights on riskier mortgages, if implemented,
will usefully increase the buffer to absorb
possible mortgage-related losses and may
help prevent imprudent lending and
borrowing behavior, However, the
effectiveness of these measures warrants close
monitoring, and more direct tools such as
minimum affordability ratios should also be
included in the macroprudential toolkit so that
they could be readily deployed in case a
housing bubble starts to develop. Improving
access to bank information would also help
the SNB better fulfill its macroprudential
oversight responsibility. Furthermore,

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

consideration should be given to reducing tax
incentives for households to take on mortgage
debt.
51.
Efforts to upgrade bank and
insurance microprudential supervision are
welcome and more progress is encouraged.
The adoption of a risk-based approach in all
areas of supervision, increased on-site reviews,
and stronger supervisory involvement in
regulatory audits should improve the quality of
supervision. However, resources should be
further expanded to broaden in-house
supervisory capacity and reduce reliance on
external auditors. In the insurance sector, the
implementation of the SST by all insurers has
helped improve solvency and risk
management in the industry. Given the
relatively high level of intra-group balances in
insurance companies, the oversight of intragroup connections needs to be strengthened
to contain contagion risk.
52.
It is recommended that the next
Article IV consultation with Switzerland be
held on the usual 12-month cycle.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

ANNEX I. A LONG-TERM PERSPECTIVE ON THE SWISS EXTERNAL ACCOUNTS
1.
Switzerland has run sizable current
account surpluses for longer than any other
advanced economy.1 Since the early 1990s, its
current account has trended upwards, reaching
a peak at 15 percent of GDP in 2006, and again
in 2010–11. This long-term improvement is
accounted for by the growing surplus in the
investment income account and by rising
positive balances in the goods and services
account.
2.
The strong investment income
performance reflects the large net foreign
asset position and the high yield earned on
the sizable net direct investment position.
The surplus in goods trade reflects strong
export performance in technology intensive
and highly-specialized sectors such as watches,
medical equipment, and pharmaceuticals. The
latter benefited also from growing global
health related expenditures. The widening
surplus in services trade is fully accounted for
by the merchanting sector, while the surplus in
banking financial services has shrunk since the
global financial crisis.2
3.
To assess external performance in
the case of Switzerland, it may be more
useful to examine directly the country’s net
foreign asset position rather than the
current account, as the latter is somewhat
misleading. 3 Swiss net foreign assets have
1

As noticed by IMF research since at least the mid1990s (e.g. Mauro 1995).
2

Merchanting is the activity of buying commodities
from a nonresident and subsequently selling them to
another nonresident without the good entering the
country.
3
For instance, the accounting treatment of investment
income overestimates the Swiss current account

grown from 83 percent of GDP in 1995 to
138 percent of GDP in 2010. This is an
impressive build-up, but far less than what
would be implied by the accumulation of
current account surpluses. In fact, the rate of
accumulation of NFA has been on average
3½ percent of GDP per year over the last 15
years, vis-à-vis an average current account
surplus of over 10 percent. The discrepancy,
which has been noted before (Stoffels and
Tille 2007), arises because valuation changes
have affected foreign assets differently from
foreign liabilities. More specifically, over 200010 capital gains have been close to zero on
foreign liabilities but negative on foreign
assets, reflecting in part the different asset
composition (Swiss foreign liabilities have a
larger share of equities) but also adverse
valuation effects due to the long-run
appreciation of the exchange rate.4

surplus as retained earnings of Swiss multinationals
are treated as income inflows, with no discounting for
the foreign ownership of Swiss multinationals. In 2011,
this generated a 5 percent upward bias in the current
account (Swiss National Bank 2006; private
communication with SNB officers).
4

Stoffels and Tille (2007) calculated that a 10 percent
appreciation of the Swiss franc would have reduced
the value of the gross international asset position by
29 percent of GDP in 2005. The SNB estimates
valuation changes due to exchange rate movements at
about 70 percent of GDP over 2002–10.

4.
What may explain the build-up in
the Swiss NFA? The literature has found that
rich countries and those with a large share of
the population nearing retirement tend to
have a larger net foreign asset position.
Adding to the effect of a demographic
structure conducive to NFA accumulation, the
nature of the pension system may lead to high
savings rates by households: Switzerland has a
well developed system of mandatory secondpillar retirement saving, which accounts for
half of overall household saving and
15 percent of gross national saving (Jarrett and
Letremy, 2008). These pension funds held
assets worth more than 100 percent of GDP
already in 2009, one of the highest GDP shares
in the OECD. In addition, Switzerland’s role as
an international financial center may play a
role in an explanation, as it is well known that
such centers tend, on average, to run large
current account surpluses and accumulate
positive net foreign asset positions (Lee et
al., 2008). However, so far there is no
theoretical explanation of why this should be
the case.
5.
Whatever their fundamental
determinants, the large current account
balance surplus and net foreign asset buildup are likely to play an important role in

32

exchange rate determination. While shortterm movements in exchange rates are usually
dominated by monetary and other high
frequency factors, the currencies of countries
with large NFA positions tend to have more
appreciated real exchange rates (Lee et
al., 2008) and their trade balance tends to
deteriorate in the long-run (Lane and MilesiFerretti, 2002). This happens because a larger
external wealth allows for higher consumption
and trade deficits, which in equilibrium is
accommodated by an increase in the price
level of the country receiving the international
transfers, as in the classic “transfer problem”
analyzed by Keynes (Lane and MilesiFerretti, 2004). Thus, also in the case of
Switzerland, the large net foreign asset
position may be a long-term factor pushing up
the exchange rate.

ANNEX II. SWITZERLAND: FISCAL DISCIPLINE IN A FEDERAL SYSTEM
1.
Switzerland is a confederation of 26
cantons and almost 2600 municipalities. Its
public finances are highly decentralized (see
table 3). In particular, subnational governments
have considerable autonomy in determining
key parameter of the bulk of taxes they
receive, such as the tax rate. As a result, there
is a substantial degree of heterogeneity across
cantons in the level and nature of taxation, and
tax competition is an important characteristic
of the system.
2.
The remarkable degree of fiscal
discipline in this federal system rests on two
pillars: (1) inter-governmental fiscal relations
with a streamlined task distribution and close
links at the same government level between
spending decisions and the responsibility for
their financing; these features restrain task
duplications and, together with a no bail-out
presumption, limit any deficit bias at lower
government levels; and (2) effective fiscal rules
that avoid over-complexity and, hence, remain
tractable both from a technical as well as
political economy perspective.

cantons used to have joint responsibility, 17
are now exclusively assigned to one of the two
levels. As for the areas were a joint
responsibility remains, there is a clearer
division of labor between strategic tasks
(assigned to the federal level) and operational
tasks (allocated to the cantons). Cooperation
among cantons has also been enhanced.
5.
Simultaneously, the volume of earmarked transfers was substantially reduced,
and the fiscal equalization scheme was
rationalized to two mechanisms: 1
(a) Compensations for different fiscal
resource potentials across cantons. These
compensations are financed by both the
federal level and relatively better-off cantons.
(b) Compensations for differing fiscal needs
arising from either varying sociodemographic or geographic characteristics.
The former criterion benefits mostly urban
areas, while the latter is to the advantage of
mainly peripheral cantons with low
population density. These compensations are
exclusively financed by the federal level.

Inter-Governmental Fiscal Relations
3.
The current system of intergovernmental fiscal relations was reformed
recently. After a long preparation period, the
new system became effective in 2008. The
reform covered both the distribution of tasks
across levels of government and the fiscal
equalization mechanism.
4.
The distribution of tasks across
government levels was streamlined. Out of
40 areas for which the confederation and

6.
A presumption of “no bail-out” at
both the cantonal and municipal level,
which avoids “fiscal moral hazard”. This
presumption has been confirmed in the 1990s
when several cantons were in dire financial
straits due to their guarantees to cantonal
1

In addition, the reform includes compensation
payments to ease the transition from the old to the
new system for some cantons. These payments are
going to be successively reduced over a time period of
almost thirty years unless abolished earlier by
parliament during regular reform reviews.

banks. At the municipal level it was
corroborated in 2003 when the Swiss Federal
Court decided in the case of a municipality
(Loèche les Bains) that the canton Valais was
not responsible for its liabilities. In addition,
cantonal ratings differ significantly and would
not appear to assume federal bail-out support,
and the variation of spreads across cantons
suggests a close link with their fiscal position
and the strength of their fiscal rules.2
7.
The new system has put in place
better incentives for each level of
government. This rationalized system of
intergovernmental fiscal relations, coupled
with the credible no-bail out presumption and
traditionally high tax autonomy, provides for a
close link between spending decisions and the
responsibility for their financing at the same
government level. This sets the right incentives
for a responsible use of public resources and
the acceptance of and compliance with fiscal
rules.3

Fiscal Rules
8.
Fiscal rules exist at both the federal
and the subnational level. The most
prominent Swiss fiscal rule is the so-called
“debt brake” rule at the federal level. It is, in
essence, a cyclically-adjusted balanced budget
rule with an error-correction mechanism in the
form of a notional “compensation account”.
The latter accumulates deviations of budget
outcomes from rule requirements and

Experience”, Freiburg/Mannheim (version of January

although difficult to emulate in other countries, foster
the articulation of these incentives.

mandates additional consolidation efforts once
a negative balance of 6 percent of expenditure
is reached.
9.
Operationally, the rule is mapped
into annual expenditure ceilings. These
floors can only be raised in exceptional
circumstances that are out of the control of
the authorities, such as a severe recession. The
severity of a recession is determined through a
number of indicators and any deviation from
the fiscal rule requires an absolute majority in
both chambers of parliament.4
10.
The federal fiscal rule led to a
substantial reduction in the debt-to-GDP
ratio. It was enshrined into the constitution
and became effective in 2003 after a string of
large deficits in the 1990s. After its inception,
the federal debt-to-GDP ratio fell by some
10 percentage points, not least due to the
asymmetry of the rule which allows for
overperformance.
11.
At the subnational government
level, most of the cantons have fiscal rules
as well. These are very heterogeneous and
vary with respect to the target, operational
implementation, exemption clauses, and
sanctioning mechanisms. 5 Municipal finances
are subject to the oversight by the respective
canton.

long-term sustainability. In particular the

useful tool to reduce the need for repeated

Annex III. The Short-Term Effect of Real Appreciation on Swiss Economic
Growth: A VAR Analysis
1.
Using a VAR framework, this annex
provides a quantitative assessment of the
effect of exchange rate on Swiss GDP
growth. The Swiss franc appreciated in real
effective terms by almost 30 percent
between 2008Q3 and 2011Q3, with an
appreciation of similar size occurring in
bilateral terms against the euro. Real
appreciation is usually thought to slow down
economic activity, as demand shifts away from
domestic output. While the Swiss economy did
experience a recession in 2009, growth
recovered swiftly as the world economy
improved in 2010 and early 2011 even though
the real exchange rate continued to
strengthen, suggesting that the positive effect
of the world recovery dominated the
contractionary effect coming from the
exchange rate.
2.
To quantify the importance of
global and country specific shocks in
Switzerland, we estimate a vector
autoregression (VAR). The model has six
endogenous variables and 8 lags (as
determined by Akaike tests for lag length). The
model distinguishes between global variables,
i.e. those that are not affected by Swiss specific
developments, and Swiss macroeconomic
variables. That is made operational by
constraining the effect of Swiss variables on
global variables to be nil. The global variables
we include are the world GDP growth (world)
and the log change in oil prices in US dollars
(dloilp). For the Swiss economy, we include
GDP growth (growth), the differential in shortterm interest rates between Switzerland and
the euro area (Germany before the euro

adoption) (dshort), the log change in the real
effective exchange rate (dlreer) and CPI
inflation (infl).
3.
In the preferred specification, we
estimate the model on quarterly data
spanning from 1991Q1 to 2011Q4. The
identification of the structural shocks is based
on a Cholesky decomposition with world GDP
growth going first, and then followed by the
change in oil prices, Swiss GDP growth, the
differential in interest rates, the change in the
REER, and CPI inflation. The VAR is estimated
so that in the reduced form Swiss variables do
not enter the equations for world GDP and oil
prices.
4.
The main results are as follows (see
Figures 1A-1B):




The real exchange rate has had trend
appreciation with some fluctuations
around this trend.1 Shocks to the real
exchange rate tend to vanish after a few
years. A typical REER shock (a onestandard deviation shock) causes a
quarterly appreciation of about 1¼ percent
on impact.
During the sample period, real
appreciations have been followed by brief
but economically and statistically
significant reductions in the differential
between Swiss franc and euro short- term
rates (Figure 1A). This is probably because
monetary policy tends to respond to

This trend is in evidence well before the beginning of
our sample period – since at least the mid 1970s.

unexpected movements in the real
exchange rate aiming to counter its effects
on output or inflation.
The peak impact of real appreciation on
GDP growth rates happens in the second
quarter after the REER shock (Figure 1A).
Thus, the lag in the effect is relatively short.
The cumulative effect on GDP is
statistically significant and sizeable. A one

standard deviation shock to REER causes a
loss of about 0.2 percent in the GDP level
relative to baseline, over 2 years
(Figure 1B).
The effect on inflation is not immediate
and is relatively small (for the typical REER
shock, the price level is less than
0.1 percentage point lower after 2 years).

5.
To gauge the impact of real
appreciation (dlreer) on growth, we
compare its magnitude to the impact of
shocks to the interest rate differential
(dshort) and world GDP growth rate
(world). It turns out that a typical shock to
world GDP has a larger estimated effect on the
Swiss GDP growth than a shock to dlreer and
dshort (Figure 2), and the effect of the interest
differentials has the opposite sign than
expected.

SWITZERLAND

7.
Finally, we consider how much the
recent real appreciation has contributed to
weakness in GDP growth. To this end, we
recover the structural shocks to the real
exchange rate equation since 2008Q1 and
calculate the impulse they generate to GDP
growth going forward. In our preferred
estimates, the REER equation has some
explanatory power for GDP growth and its
residuals since 2007, while negative for a few
quarters, have been sharply positive over 2011
(Figure 3). According to the model, past
movements in the real exchange rate will cut
quarterly growth by about 1 percentage point
between 2011Q4 and 2012Q4, with some of
this effect offset from 2013 onwards. This
confirms that the Swiss economy is facing
headwinds in the near term as a consequence
of the appreciation of the Swiss franc during
the last few years.

6.
Next we consider a variance
decomposition of Swiss GDP growth. At all
horizons, the effect of global GDP growth
looms large, dominating the effect of own
shocks to Swiss GDP and those of oil prices,
monetary policy or real exchange rate
(Figure 3).

ANNEX IV. FISCAL MULTIPLIERS IN SWITZERLAND
1.
Economic research on the size of
fiscal multipliers points to a wide range of
values, depending on the model, monetary
policy assumptions, the type and persistence
of government spending and tax cuts, their
financing, and the degree of excess capacity in
the overall economy or the affected sectors.1
2.
Empirically, recent work by the
OECD on the effects of stimulus measures in
the 2008–09 crisis confirms theoretical
expectations that fiscal multipliers in
Switzerland are smaller than in larger and
more closed economies. However, they are not
negligible and in a similar range as in other
small open economies.
3.
These estimates are based on an
average of simulation results from various
macro models surveyed in the OECD study.
Only simulations in which monetary policy is
set to be accommodative are considered, in
line with current Swiss circumstances, and the
multipliers take openness into account.
However, they should be considered as an
upper bound, as they are not adjusted for
other factors that played a role in 2008/2009
and may play a role in a new downturn as well
– such as an increase in the propensity to save
in crisis times. For evaluating the fiscal
packages of the 2008/2009 crisis, the OECD
has therefore made some judgmental
adjustment to the above multipliers and
computed so-called “reference multipliers.”2 In
1

See, e.g., Ramey, Valerie A. (2011), “Can Government
Purchases Stimulate the Economy?”, JEL, 49:3, 673-685;
and IMF (2008), World Economic Outlook, Chapter 5.
2

For details on the applied methodology, see OECD
Economic Outlook – Interim Report (March 2009)

addition, the study usefully computes separate
multipliers for different expenditure and tax
categories. In the case of Switzerland, as for
other countries, increases in government
investment have the largest effect on output,
followed by government consumption, while
increases in transfers or tax cuts have smaller
effects. 3
4.
In conclusion, these results suggest
that a fiscal stimulus in Switzerland would
be effective in mitigating an economic
downturn, even if the exact magnitude of
its impact remains hard to predict.

3

Furthermore, the Swiss research institute KOF
estimated a GDP multiplier of 0.3 in the first year of a
construction stimulus, assuming spare capacity in the
construction sector. Unpublished simulations of the
Swiss Federal Finance Administration feature an
expenditure multiplier of 0.6 in the first year. See,
respectively, KOF (2009), “Beschaeftigungswirkungen
eines Investitionsprogramms fuer die Schweiz,
Simulationen mit dem KOF-Makromodell”, Zuerich;

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free
floating; the exchange rate of the Swiss franc is
determined by market forces in the foreign
exchange market. However, the Swiss National
Bank (SNB) reserves the right to intervene in
the foreign exchange market. All settlements
are made at free market rates. On September
6, 2011, the SNB set a minimum exchange rate
of CHF 1.20 per euro to stop the appreciation
of the franc and committed to defending the
limit by buying foreign currency in unlimited
quantities. The SNB publishes information
regarding its foreign exchange transactions in
its annual accountability report. In 2011, to
combat the massive overvaluation of the Swiss
franc and to enforce the minimum exchange
rate, the SNB purchased foreign currency to a
value of approximately CHF 17.8 billion. The
purchases were made with a wide range of
counterparties in Switzerland and abroad.
Effective September 6, 2011, the de facto
exchange rate arrangement is other managed.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Switzerland’s economic and financial statistics
are adequate for surveillance purposes.
Switzerland generally publishes timely
economic statistics and posts most of the data
and the underlying documentation on the
internet. In June 1996, Switzerland subscribed
to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS), and its metadata are
currently posted on the Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board. Switzerland is in full
observance of SDDS requirements, and it is
availing itself of the SDDS’s flexibility options
on dissemination of production index data (for
periodicity and timeliness) and of wages and
earnings data (for periodicity). However, a
number of statistical gaps and deficiencies
remain, mainly reflecting a lack of resources
and the limited authority of the Federal
Statistical Office (BfS) to request information:
 reliable general government finance
statistics appear with considerable lags,
mainly due to delays in compiling fiscal
accounts at the level of cantons and
communes;

providing, e.g., a more detailed breakdown by
industry for the services sector. At the
beginning of 2010, the SNB started to publish
results from its monthly survey on the cost
of borrowing. Also in 2010, the SNB
introduced a survey on the quality of banks’
credit portfolios, based on the concepts of
probability of default and expected loss. In
2011 the SNB collected—in the context of its
surveys on payment transactions—data on
customer payments. In order to gain
information on the effects of the financial crisis
on domestic bank lending, the SNB has been
collecting qualitative data on the lending
policies of about 20 banks since the first
quarter of 2008. The results of the survey
complement the quantitative data obtained
from existing statistics and was transformed
into part of the bank lending survey starting
in 2011. Work is under way to completely
revise the survey on trade in services. The
collection of data based on the new survey
started in 2012, providing among other things
a detailed country breakdown.



pension statistics are published with a long
lag;



GDP by industry appears with a
considerable lag.

Annual national accounts were upgraded in
2003 to the European System of Accounts 1995
(ESA95) and with the release of the Q4 2004
data, the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs
(SECO) revised accordingly its quarterly
national account estimates. The main
innovations in the new national accounts were
in investment (with detail on information and
communications technology), private and
public consumption (hospitals were transferred
to the private sector), and the use of chain
price indices (without adjustment for quality).
SECO started publishing a quarterly
production account in March 2006. In October

To address deficiencies, the authorities are
taking or intend to take the following steps:
In 2009, the SNB for the first time
complemented its publication on the financial
wealth of private households with an
estimation of assets held in real estate. The
SNB has revised its loan survey with effect
from the reference date of 31 March 2009,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SWITZERLAND

2008, SECO added income approach estimates
(at current prices only) to its quarterly national
accounts.
In 2004, a cooperation agreement in the
fields of statistics was concluded with the EU
for the harmonization of several Swiss
statistical domains with EU standards. The
treaty entered into force in 2007. The
agreement was updated in 2010 and now
includes BOP data, as well as various new
provisions aiming at an ever greater
compatibility with EU statistics, notably in the
fields of national accounts (additional national
accounts data: short-term public finance
statistics, quarterly non-financial accounts for
general government), external trade and labor
force surveys.
The Federal Finance Administration has
finished revamping fiscal statistics with the
adoption of the Government Finance Statistics
Manual 2001, the reform of the accounting
standards for cantons and communes
(Harmonisiertes Rechnungslegungsmodell der
Kantone HRM2) and the introduction of full
accrual budgeting and accounting at the level
of the federal government (Neues
Rechnungsmodell Bund NAM) along the lines
of the International Public Sector Accounting
Standards (IPSAS). Figures according to the
new accounting standards have been
produced for the federal government (NAM)
2008 and for some cantons (HRM2) for 2009.
Figures according to GFSM2001 have been
reported beginning in 2009. A ROSC mission
on fiscal transparency took place during
January 16–29, 2009. In order to counter the
lags in the compilation of the general
government finance statistics, the Federal
Finance Administration will start to produce
quarterly estimates in 2012 for the most
important aggregates at all levels of

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

government (Confederation, Cantons,
Communes, Social Security). Moreover, efforts
are ongoing to implement harmonized
accounting standards across all levels of
government.
Quarterly balance of payments and
international investment position data are
compiled by the SNB and meet international
standards. However, monetary gold
transactions relating to sales of gold reserves
not required for monetary policy purposes
have not been correctly reflected in the
balance of payments. For legal reasons, and
until the distribution of the proceeds of gold
sales between the SNB and the Federal
Department of Finance was concluded in
February 2005, the proceeds of the gold sales
not needed for monetary purposes were
considered as part of the official reserves in
the balance of payments. After that date, they
appear in the position “other assets of the
SNB” in the balance of payments.
Switzerland has continued to provide data on
Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) and
participated in the 2009 Coordinated Direct
Investment Survey. The data and metadata
for both these initiatives have been posted on
the IMF website.
With regard to AML/CFT, the FATF Plenary
decided in October 2009 that Switzerland had
made significant progress in addressing the
deficiencies which were identified in its 2005
mutual evaluation report, and on that basis,
decided to remove Switzerland from the
“regular follow-up” process. Switzerland
reported further improvements to its AML/CFT
System in 2011 within the context of its
biennial update, while some shortcomings
remain (for instance, in the area of beneficial
ownership).

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Switzerland
On May 2, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Switzerland. 1
Background
Faced with headwinds from the euro area debt crisis and a strong currency, the economy
slowed down in late 2011, and inflation turned negative as exchange rate appreciation was
passed through to import prices. While export growth has weakened, the external sector
continues to perform relatively well, thanks to specific sectoral strengths and high investment
income flows. The outlook for 2012 is of a gradual recovery, as foreign demand picks up, the
economy adapts to the higher level of the exchange rate, and monetary policy remains
accommodative. However, downside risks, especially from external developments, are
significant.
Monetary policy had to contend with severe exchange rate appreciation pressures in the
summer, when safe haven flows from the euro area crisis intensified and the Swiss franc
reached close to parity vis-à-vis the euro (a real effective appreciation of over 30 percent since
end-2007). After bringing the policy rate to zero and effecting a massive liquidity expansion, in
early September the Swiss National Bank committed to defend an exchange rate floor of 1.20
Swiss francs per euro, moving away from the floating regime. The exchange rate has since
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summing up can be found here:

traded closely to the floor, and the negative inflation differential with trading partners is helping
undo the real appreciation.
With loose monetary conditions, domestic mortgage credit and real estate prices continue to
rise briskly, and concern is growing that a bubble may be forming, endangering exposed
domestically-oriented banks and insurance companies. To address this risk, a government
working group has recommended strengthening the macroprudential toolkit by introducing the
Basel III counter-cyclical capital buffer (CCB), improving the classification of risk weights in
mortgage lending, and broadening the SNB’s power to request information from banks.
The financial sector is adapting to the new, more stringent regulatory environment, including the
recently approved “too big to fail” legislation requiring systemically important banks to hold more
capital than Basel III. After a marked improvement in 2010, the performance of the two large
banks worsened in 2011, with income generation lagging other global peers. Although they
comfortably fulfill current regulatory capital requirements, these banks still have a relatively thin
layer of high quality capital and, given their business model, rely heavily on wholesale funding.
The fiscal position is healthy and government debt low, with a broadly neutral stance projected
for 2012. Fiscal rules at both the federal and cantonal level and well-designed intergovernmental fiscal arrangements provide a foundation for fiscal discipline. In the medium-term,
however, pressures from population aging are building.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that, notwithstanding Switzerland’s strong economic fundamentals
and policy frameworks, downside risks stemming mostly from the euro area crisis and
vulnerabilities in the domestic financial sector clouded the near-term outlook. Against this
background, Directors stressed the importance of pragmatic and flexible policy responses in the
period ahead.
Directors considered the authorities’ decision to continue to defend an exchange rate floor
appropriate in light of the slow pace of activity and remaining deflation risks. They encouraged,
however, the Swiss National Bank to return to a freely floating exchange rate regime once the
growth and inflation outlook normalizes. In this context, Directors noted the dual risks of
removing the exchange rate floor too soon or maintaining it for too long in the face of persistent
capital inflows, and encouraged the authorities to exit from the current arrangement with great
care.
Directors considered the authorities’ fiscal plans appropriately calibrated to build buffers against
contingent liabilities in the financial sector and the prospective budgetary impact of population
aging. Nonetheless, should downside risks materialize, a number of Directors saw room for
additional fiscal measures to support aggregate demand in line with existing fiscal rules. To
better cope with the fiscal implications of population aging over the longer term, Directors
advocated further reforms to the pension system, including measures to index benefits or the
retirement age to life expectancy.
Directors commended the authorities for the passage of the “too-big-to-fail” legislation but
emphasized the need for further progress in bolstering the loss-absorbing capital of systemically
important banks. They noted that although these banks fulfill current capital requirements, there

is scope to raise their high-quality capital. Directors recognized, however, that more capital
alone cannot fully eliminate “too-big-to-fail” risks and supported continued efforts toward
improving bank resolution mechanisms and strengthening financial oversight, including by
broadening in-house supervisory capacity.
Directors supported the steps taken to contain risks in the mortgage market and the real estate
sector. Given constraints on monetary policy, they viewed macroprudential measures as the
appropriate instruments to address such risks, and encouraged the authorities to consider a
broad toolkit, including Basel III countercyclical capital buffers, increased risk-weights for riskier
mortgage loans, and other macroprudential and fiscal measures.

Statement by Mr. Rene Weber, Executive Director for Switzerland
and Mr. Marcel Peter, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
May 2, 2012
On behalf of our Swiss authorities, we would like to thank the staff for once more putting
together a substantive and helpful report. The authorities welcome the candid policy
recommendations, which add considerable value to domestic policy discussions. In most
respects, they share the staff’s appraisal of the challenges going forward. The authorities also
value the emphasis the report puts on the risks to the economic outlook, and they appreciate
the risk matrix. They believe this report is a good example of the progress being made in
improving risk assessments in Fund surveillance.
Outlook
The IMF’s latest scenario for the Swiss economy is very much in line with that of our
authorities and most forecasters. While the domestic-oriented parts of the economy, like the
construction sector, are faring reasonably well, the industries exposed to foreign competition
remain under pressure. There is thus a high degree of heterogeneity within the economy.
However, while the labor market continues to perform well and leading indicators are
pointing upward again, the economic outlook depends crucially on the international
environment. The key assumption behind the authorities’ expectation of a gradual recovery
this year and next is that the euro area manages to progressively overcome its debt crisis.
This prospect is, of course, far from ensured. There are also domestic risks, above all the
rising imbalances in the Swiss housing market. The ratio of mortgage credit to GDP has
reached an all-time high, and property prices have risen much faster than rents. The
authorities thus agree with staff that uncertainty is high, and that the downside risks are
significant.
One aspect where the authorities’ view notably differs from the staff’s is the output gap.
Their estimate of the output gap suggests that it reopened in 2011 and is still negative.
Monetary policy
In line with staff, our authorities consider the Swiss franc still overvalued. The overvaluation
continues to generate deflationary pressures and represents a significant challenge to the
export-oriented sectors. They share the staff’s assessment that the introduction of the
exchange rate floor in September 2011 was an appropriate policy response to the risk of
deflation and economic contraction. In particular, and as emphasized by the staff, other
policy options were limited, with policy rates at the zero lower bound, asset purchases
constrained by the size of the bond market, and fiscal policy governed by the structural
balance rule, the so-called debt brake (see below). The exchange rate floor is a tool that is

2
used to achieve the Swiss National Bank’s (SNB) mandate of price stability, taking into
account business cycle developments.
Our authorities emphasize that they will enforce the minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per
euro with the utmost determination. This floor will remain in place as long as warranted by
the outlook for inflation and growth. The SNB stands ready to take further measures at any
time if the economic outlook and the risk of deflation so require. This being said, the SNB
agrees with staff’s assessment that a return to a freely floating exchange rate regime is
desirable, once economic conditions normalize.
Fiscal policy
Switzerland’s government finances are sound. In 2011, the general government fiscal balance
has been in surplus for the sixth consecutive year. This year, the fiscal position is expected to
weaken somewhat as a result of slowing growth due to the continued strength of the Swiss
franc and poor economic conditions in the EU. The social security funds (unemployment
insurance) will be particularly affected by a renewed economic slowdown. In addition, the
federal accounts will have to absorb the costs of structural tax reforms and the reduction in
the SNB’s distribution of profits.
In this context, our authorities stress their firm commitment to uphold the current fiscal
strategy—namely compliance with the requirements of the debt brake rule in the short and
medium term, and maintaining expenditure growth at a sustainable level. They consider a
structurally balanced budget as the best way forward, especially in an environment of high
uncertainty.
Our authorities remain skeptical on the use of discretionary fiscal policy to support aggregate
demand. Switzerland’s experience with fiscal stimulus measures has been mixed. Most
recently, the stabilization programs in 2009-2010 as well as the measures adopted in 2011 to
support the export sector demonstrated the difficulties of designing fiscal stimuli in a timely,
targeted, and temporary manner. The main countercyclical role should thus be played by
automatic stabilizers, which were strengthened through the introduction of the debt brake
framework.
Regarding long-term fiscal pressures, our authorities share the Fund’s assessment on the
urgency to find a solution to the increasing costs of ageing. They consider fiscal rules a
promising tool to ensure the financial stability of social insurances, while enabling
parliament to retain discretionary power in this area. A fiscal rule has successfully been
implemented for unemployment insurance, and a new rule is currently being debated in
parliament for disability insurance. Designing a similar approach for public old-age pensions
is more complex and will require great care, as this pay-as-you-go insurance is only one
element of the three-pillar system.

Financial sector policies
Our authorities share the Fund’s assessment of the main challenges to ensure financial
stability: the need to strengthen the large banks’ capitalization, implement organizational
measures to increase resolvability, and address the risks associated with the build-up of
imbalances in the domestic mortgage and real estate markets.
While our authorities agree with the staff’s view that the large banks remain thinly
capitalized according to high-quality capital indicators, including simple leverage ratios, they
also note that they are well capitalized relative to peers in terms of regulatory Tier 1 capital.
As highlighted by the staff, the comparatively low CDS spreads for the large Swiss banks
suggest that markets consider them well prepared to withstand financial turmoil.
Nonetheless, our authorities agree with the staff that progress to strengthen the quantity and
quality of capital is needed.
Our authorities are committed to addressing the weaknesses exposed by the financial crisis.
Work is well under way to implement advanced regulatory and supervisory frameworks.
While the Basel III framework is due to enter into force on January 1, 2013, a comprehensive
SIFI/TBTF-framework and a fully risk-based insurance supervision (Swiss Solvency Test,
SST) are in place. The SIFI legislation does not only aim at increasing the resilience of
systemically important banks but also establishes strong incentives for these institutions to
reduce their systemic impact and to improve their global resolvability. Our authorities share
the staff’s view that this legislation will be instrumental in reducing systemic risk in the
domestic banking system.
Macroprudential framework
Our authorities broadly share the staff’s view on the need for macroprudential instruments to
address the risks stemming from developments in the domestic mortgage and real estate
markets. The counter-cyclical buffer is designed to target imbalances building up in
particular market segments, such as residential mortgages. The proposed activation process
ensures that a decision is taken within two months at the most, which the authorities consider
sufficiently timely. Also, our authorities stress that the 12 months granted to banks to raise
capital levels constitute a maximum. In case of substantial undesirable developments, shorter
deadlines would be imposed to increase the stabilizing effect of the buffer. With regard to the
minimum affordability ratios proposed by the staff, the FDF and FINMA are in discussions
with the banks on tightening the self-regulation pertaining to the mortgage market. Such
enhanced industry standards could have a similar effect like an affordability ratio, while
avoiding an overly interventionist approach.

4
Our authorities share the staff’s view on the preferential tax treatment of mortgage interest
payments. From a financial stability view, and as elaborated on in the February 2012 report
of the joint Financial Stability Working Group, policies that promote excessive household
indebtedness should be avoided. However, the authorities note that a reform aimed at
reducing or eliminating the tax deductibility of mortgage interest payments is currently not
likely to obtain the necessary political support.
Financial Sector Stability Assessment
As a member with a systemically important financial sector, Switzerland is committed to
meeting its obligation to conduct a mandatory Financial Sector Stability Assessment within
the agreed cycle. The Swiss authorities have requested such an assessment under the FSAP
that is scheduled to take place towards the end of 2013.
