STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 31, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context: Austria did not experience a severe boom-bust cycle and came through the
crisis relatively well. The main impact was on the banking sector and public debt. With
cyclical slack low and the recovery taking hold, this is the time to resolve crisis legacies
and address long-standing structural issues.
Outlook and risks: The recovery is taking hold, driven by a pick-up in exports. The most
acute risks are mainly geopolitical and could in particular lead to financial spillovers.
Financial sector policies: Bank restructuring should now be rapidly completed and bad
asset disposal accelerated. Large internationally active banks should stand ready for
further capital increases, and the EU banking union framework needs to be swiftly
transposed at the national level.
Public expenditure reforms: More decisive expenditure reforms in key areas such as
pensions, health care, subsidies, and fiscal federalism would generate savings that could
be used for both an accelerated debt reduction and lower labor taxation.
Boosting potential output growth: Enhancing IT adaptation, improving the
performance of the education system, facilitating access to financing for innovative startups, and reducing administrative barriers for new businesses would raise potential
growth and labor productivity.

2.
The main impact of the crisis was on the
internationally active banking system and public
debt. Pre-crisis, Austrian banks expanded rapidly in
CESEE, channeling funds they attracted in Western
Europe to finance the credit boom in the region. As
their funding dried up post-Lehman, and their
assets suffered from the end of the credit boom in
CESEE, internationally active Austrian banks came
under pressure and needed government support.
Together with the downturn, this has contributed
to an increase in public debt from 60 percent of
GDP in 2007 to around 80 percent of GDP in this
year.

Austria came through the global economic and financial crisis relatively well, reflecting
the absence of large pre-crisis domestic imbalances (Figure 1). In the run-up to the 2008–09
crisis, household and corporate debt levels had



Banking sector: The medium-sized banks nationalized during the crisis are still restructuring,
and internationally active large banks remain subject to risks from CESEE, most recently in
Russia, Ukraine and Hungary.



More ambitious structural public expenditure reforms to bring down debt faster and
reduce the high tax burden on labor. Debt reduction under current plans leaves debt above
AAA peer levels, and will not build sufficient buffers to cope with intensifying aging cost
pressures, potential further bank restructuring costs, and residual risks from banks’ CESEE
exposure as well as other contingent liabilities. High social security contributions and income tax
rates discourage labor supply and hamper potential growth.1



Raising potential output and productivity growth to bring Austria closer to the
technological frontier: Austria’s productivity per hour is 20 percent lower than in the US, and
the gap is widening. The gap likely reflects a multitude of factors, including weaknesses in IT
adaptation, education, and the availability of private venture capital.

5.
In September 2013, the governing coalition of Social Democrats and Austrian People’s
Party was re-elected, albeit with a slimmer majority. In the previous legislative period, the
government had taken several structural expenditure reform steps in the right direction, including
on pensions and health care. These measures were confirmed in the coalition agreement. However,
this new agreement and the fiscal framework 2015–18 contain no major additional structural
expenditure measures, reflecting a divergence in views among coalition partners on many policy
issues.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND
RISKS
Background
6.
The recovery is taking hold and financial markets have eased further (Figures 2 and 3).
GDP, which had stagnated for about a year, resumed growth in the second half of 2013. Staff
currently projects growth of 1½ percent in 20142 and 1¾ percent in 2015, compared with
0.3 percent in 2013. The recovery is following the typical pattern for Austria: it is being driven by a
pickup in exports, with investment and consumption expected to follow suit.
7.
Inflation has come down, but is high relative to other euro area countries, and the risk
of deflation is low. Inflation has fallen from near 4 percent y/y in late 2011 to 1.5 percent in May.
The decline was largely the result of lower import prices/terms of trade gains; there are few domestic

pressures that pull inflation down. Indeed, staff currently projects 2014 full-year inflation of
1.7 percent, well above the euro area projection of 0.7 percent for 2014 and also above the rate in
Germany.3 Relatively high inflation is largely driven by the services sector, and reflects a tight labor
market. With the lowest unemployment rate in the euro area (currently around 5 percent), wage cost
increases since 2008 have been amongst the highest in the euro area.

Geopolitical developments pose risks (see risk matrix). Two internationally active
Austria-based banks (RBI and Italian-owned Unicredit Bank Austria) face spillovers from Ukraine and
Russia. Banks also suffer idiosyncratic country risks from policy actions in Hungary. Other risk factors
include the ECB’s comprehensive balance sheet assessment, which may lead to surprises on banks’
CESEE asset quality; and lower-than-expected growth in emerging markets and the euro area that
would predominantly be transmitted via exports to Germany or through strong real and financial
sector ties with Italy.
9.
As regards outward spillovers, funding shocks for Austrian banks would spill over to
CESEE (Figure 4). Funding pressures would likely lead to a cutback in parent funding to CESEE
subsidiaries, constraining credit growth in host countries.

In the past two years inflation has also exceeded German inflation by ½ percentage point on average.

Austria’s current account and real effective exchange rate are broadly in line with
fundamentals (Figure 5). EBA sends conflicting

signals: the current account is above the norm,4
(Euro area indices)
but so is the real exchange rate. In both cases, the

results do not reflect policy gaps but an

surplus last year (2.7 percent of GDP) was equal to
its average over the past ten years—a sharp
contrast with Germany and the Netherlands, which 100
saw sharp increases. The real exchange rate has
been stable as well, and Austria’s export
90
performance has been about average—not as
good as Germany’s, for example, but much better
than Italy’s. Austria’s IIP is near zero, giving it an
intermediate position among euro area countries. Going forward, there are no indications that the
current account surplus or underlying competitiveness would change substantially.

The authorities’ view
11.
Authorities’ and staff forecasts and risk assessment are broadly in line. Growth forecasts
of the Austrian Central Bank (OeNB) and the two leading economic research institutes (WIFO and
IHS) hover around 1½ percent in 2014 and 1¾ percent in 2015. Projection differences for
unemployment and inflation between these institutions and with staff are also small. The authorities
broadly agreed on the risks identified by staff.
12.
The authorities agree there are no clear signs of real exchange rate under-or
overvaluation, but are somewhat more worried about the persistent inflation difference with
Germany. The gap is attributable to persistently higher services and administrative price increases.

4

According to EBA, in 2013, the difference between the cyclically adjusted current account (3.4 percent of GDP) and
the cyclically adjusted current account norm (1.5 percent) was due to an unexplained residual of 2.4 percentage
points—the contribution of the policy gap was negative.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most
likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment
of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a
probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff
views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Nonmutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The discussions focused on the key reform priorities for the still fresh legislative period:
(1) completion of bank restructuring and further strengthening of macro-financial stability;
(2) public expenditure reforms to enable both faster debt reduction and lower labor
taxation; and (3) raising productivity and bringing Austria closer to the technology frontier.

A. Completing Bank Restructuring and Strengthening Macro-Financial
Stability
Background
13.
During the pre-crisis boom years, Austrian banks expanded aggressively—but in
CESEE, not in Austria. Incentives to expand in the two markets were very different: banking in
CESEE was very profitable, while profitability in the domestic Austrian market is structurally low.
Banks funded their expansion through bond issuance and other borrowing in Western European
markets, rather than through deposit taking from the nonfinancial sector in Austria.
14.
This expansion created vulnerabilities that became evident in the aftermath of
Lehman. As their funding dried up, and their assets suffered from the end of the credit boom in
CESEE, Austrian banks came under pressure. Except for Italian-owned Unicredit Bank Austria, all
Austria-based banks with major activities in CESEE received government support. Two of these
banks had to be fully or partly nationalized and they have been retreating from the region.6
6

The problems of a third nationalized bank (Kommunalkredit) were rooted mainly in its considerable bond and CDS
exposure to the euro area periphery (for more background on restructuring banks, see 2013 IMF Staff Report, Box 1).

15.
Austrian banks have continued to shift to a new model, in which credit of their CESEE
subsidiaries is to a much larger extent funded by local deposits rather than by parents. The
shift was further encouraged by the supervisory guidance adopted by the authorities in 2012
(“sustainability package”), which aimed to limit

the banks’ focus on more traditional loan business.
17.
The restructuring of fully or partly nationalized banks has made progress, but
challenges remain.
After considering various resolution options for Hypo Alpe Adria, including a bankruptcy,8 the
authorities have decided to sell the SEE subsidiaries and wind down the remaining assets in a

government-owned “bad bank” (defeasance structure without a banking license).9 The

effective wipe-out of the guarantee.11 Negotiations with potential buyers for the going-concern

Another restructuring bank, the partly
nationalized apex institution of the
cooperative “Volksbanken” association
(Volksbanken AG), has substantially
downsized its balance sheet but faces difficult
further disposal challenges. This and the
ongoing ECB balance sheet assessment may
lead to higher capital needs, which could
affect lower-tier banks and the Volksbanken
association as a whole.

As for Kommunalkredit and KA Finanz, the wind-down seems to be proceeding in line with the
authorities’ plans, but further public capital needs cannot be excluded there either.

18.
Neither the non-financial corporate sector nor the household sector is overleveraged,
but housing prices warrant monitoring (Figure 7). Non-financial corporate debt hovers around
the euro area median, and increased much less in the pre-crisis years than in other countries.
Household debt is lower than the euro area average, and there has been little pressure to
deleverage.12 However, a considerable share of household borrowing consists of Swiss-franc
denominated bullet loans and variable-interest housing loans.13 Housing price increases have been
strong in recent years but purchases have been to a large extent cash-financed and the strongest
growth has been predominantly limited to Vienna and some tourist hotspots.

Policy Discussions

federal government would have had to either bail-out Carinthia (eliminating the cost savings of a bankruptcy) or let
Carinthia go bankrupt, with possibly severe contagion effects on other states and banks.
9

Technically, the “bad bank” consists of two entities: a small one with a banking license for the Italian part, and a
bigger one without for the rest.
10

The law also bails in €800 million non-guaranteed funding from the former HAA-owner Bavarian Landesbank.

11

Technically, the law voids the underlying debt. In the absence of this debt, the guarantee no longer exists.

12

The household saving rate has declined since 2009.

13

The share of foreign currency loans has been declining in recent years, as the Austrian authorities have taken steps
to rein in new foreign currency loans.

The mission and the authorities agreed that the strengthening of capital positions and
the transition toward a new funding model have reduced vulnerabilities of internationally
active banks. The ongoing shift to a new

far.14 The mission cautioned that the 2012
supervisory guidance for the largest three banks
should continue to be applied judiciously, in
close coordination with host countries, to avoid unduly restraining credit growth in still nascent
recoveries.
20.
Risks remain elevated, however, and further strengthening of the capital position of
large banks would create stronger buffers to absorb them. Bank profitability suffers from the
continued low interest rate environment and, specifically in CESEE, has been under pressure as a
result of rising NPLs, risk costs, and write-offs. Russia, where credit growth had been strong, became
a major profit contributor.15 Current events in Ukraine and Russia put this important source of
profitability and internal capital generation increasingly at risk. Further losses can also be expected
from policy actions in Hungary regarding foreign-exchange denominated loans.16
21.
The mission welcomed that a decision had been made on the resolution of Hypo Alpe
Adria. It appreciated the attention the authorities had given to the systemic importance of the bank
for some countries in the SEE region, by avoiding Hypo´s bankruptcy.
22.
Views differed on the retroactive voidance of the state of Carinthia’s guarantee of
€890 million of HAA subordinated debt. The authorities explained that the voidance was
designed and intended as an isolated case. They saw the bail-in as in line with the new European
resolution framework that would come into effect in 2016 and argued that bond holders should
have exercised better due diligence and understood that Carinthia would never be able to honor the
guarantees it had issued.17 While agreeing that bailing in of subordinated debt was in line with the

Notable exceptions include the Baltics, Hungary, and Slovenia.

15

In 2013, RBI and Bank Austria derived respectively around 75 and 60 percent of their profits from Russia.

16

Hungary’s parliament recently passed a law requiring banks to compensate borrowers for unfair lending practices,
referring to application of unilateral adjustments of the interest rate and the use of an exchange rate spread. The law
applies to both foreign-exchange and Hungarian Forint-denominated loans.

The World Bank, which holds €150 million of subordinated Hypo debt, will also be affected.

future European frameworks, the mission argued that the voiding of the state of Carinthia’s
guarantee was a separate issue, and that such a move would undermine the credibility of similar
guarantees issued by other sub-national bodies, potentially damaging the Austrian "brand" in the
future.
23.
The mission argued that the bank restructuring agenda should be rapidly completed
and asset disposal accelerated. Governance of the Hypo “bad bank”/AMC needs to ensure efficient
asset disposal over a limited timeframe. The sale of the Hypo SEE subsidiaries should be completed
as rapidly as possible, while avoiding disruptive effects in host countries. For Volksbanken AG,
speedy asset disposal, including of its Romanian subsidiary, remains equally essential. The
restructuring of the Volksbanken association needs to take into account the structurally low
profitability in the domestic banking market.
24.
The evolving European Banking Union framework is being implemented at the
national level, but key decisions are still pending. According to the authorities, preparations for
the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) are on track. As regards the Single Resolution Mechanism
(SRM), no decision on the designation of the national resolution agency had yet been made; and the
discussion on a revamping of the deposit insurance schemes (DGS) at the occasion of the
introduction of EU-mandated DGS pre-funding had not progressed since last year’s Article IV
consultation. As regards AML/CFT, in February 2014, the FATF recognized that Austria had made
significant progress in addressing deficiencies identified in the June 2009 mutual evaluation report
and decided that the country should be removed from the regular follow-up process. Nevertheless,
given possible spillovers from events in Russia/Ukraine on the real estate sector, the authorities are
encouraged to closely monitor this sector.18
25.
Similarly, the creation of a workable macroprudential framework is lagging behind.
While the legal basis for a Financial Market Stability Board has been created, at the time the mission
discussions took place, the appointment of its members still needed to go through parliament.19 The
envisaged macroprudential toolkit remains limited to various capital buffers and the possibility to
change risk weights on exposures secured by mortgages on immovable property for financial
stability considerations according to the CRR/CRD. However, the set of instruments does not
comprehend sector-specific instruments, such as LTV or DTI ratios targeted to housing market
developments. The authorities explained that the agenda had been dominated by the resolution of
Hypo Alpe Adria bank, and that they would focus their attention to these issues next.

18

The FATF reports noted that the number of suspicious transaction reported by real estate agents was 0 in both
2011 and 2012.
19

The members of the macroprudential authority, the Financial Market Stability Board, were appointed in July 2014.

Box 1. Pre-Crisis Imbalances and Post-Crisis Growth
Austria’s better performance during the crisis likely reflects that few private sector imbalances were
built up during the pre-crisis years.


Households did not go on an asset price and credit-fueled consumption boom. Many EU countries
experienced housing price booms during the pre-crisis years—including in particular in Spain,
Ireland, the UK and Eastern Europe—which boosted consumption, increased household debt and
led to a sharp decline in the saving rate. Austria was different: housing prices remained flat,
household borrowing was modest, and its saving rate increased.



The corporate sector did not over-borrow and corporate profitability did not deteriorate. In many
countries the corporate debt-to-GDP ratio increased sharply, with the largest increase in Ireland,
Bulgaria and Spain. Profit shares declined in many countries as well, as overheating labor markets
increased wage bills and reduced profit margins. On both fronts Austria was again different: the
increase in corporate debt was modest, and profitability increased moderately.

In countries with imbalances, their unwinding led to pro-cyclical behavior of the private sector, which
contributed to an often severe downturn.


Households slashed consumption as housing price booms went bust and credit dried up. As
household net worth deteriorated sharply, wealth effects went into reverse, and households were
forced to increase their saving rate—sometimes very steeply. Hence, households could not smooth
consumption; instead the increase in their saving rate contributed to the recession.



The corporate sector had to slash costs, as financing dried up and debt levels were no longer
sustainable.1 Non-profitable production capacity was shut down, and the workforce was reduced to
save costs and restore profit margins. The result was high unemployment and a sharp decline in
production. The increase in profit margins was particularly large in the Baltics, Ireland, and Spain—
which all had very sharp increases in unemployment.

In Austria the private sector behaved counter-cyclically, which mitigated the downturn.


Households reduced their saving rate, mitigating the decline in consumption. Consumption growth
remained positive in 2009, and in fact was (marginally) faster than in 2007 and 2008.



Firms did not need to slash costs, and employment remained relatively stable. Firms instead
absorbed costs of a temporarily under-utilized workforce.

The public sector made a further difference. In the pre-crisis years, in many countries the private sector
boom indirectly contributed to a public spending spree, as a surge of boom-related tax revenues generated
room to boost public expenditure. When the private sector boom ended, tax revenues dropped sharply,
forcing the governments to retrench. Austria was different here as well, as expenditure had remained under
control during the boom years, there was no need to retrench during the crisis—and in fact there was room
for countercyclical policy.

Box 2. Austria’s Banking Sector as Inter-Mediator of Western European Savings
Austria’s banks have large gross foreign assets, in large part the result of the rapid expansion in
Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe (CESEE) during the pre-crisis years. But net foreign assets are
close to zero, as foreign liabilities are high as well. This is because much of Austrian banks’ expansion has
been funded by banks and investors in Western Europe.
After the banking sectors in CESEE were opened to foreign investors in the mid to late 1990s and with
a view to EU accession of some CESEE countries,1 Austrian banks entered CESEE markets mainly
through a series of mergers and acquisitions, becoming dominant players in many markets. Their
exposure to CESEE became large not only relative to the size of the host countries (for example, by 2007,
Austria’s claims on Croatia accounted for over 50 percent of Croatia’s GDP), but also relative to the size of
Austria’s GDP. By 2007, exposure to CESEE amounted to 70 percent of GDP—more than any other Western
European country.
In the years leading up to the crisis credit expansion in CESEE was increasingly funded by transfers
from parent banks to their subsidiaries, rather than from local deposits in the host countries. This
allowed credit to grow much more rapidly, boosting profits of Austrian banks. Parent banks not only
provided funding to their subsidiaries, but in many countries also provided direct cross-border loans to the
nonfinancial private sector.
Austrian banks funded this expansion through externally issued bonds and loans. Net issuance of
international debt securities rose from US$2 billion in 1997 to US$27 billion in 2007. Additional funds were
attracted in the interbank deposit market. Overall, external debt of Austrian banks stood at US$430 billion
in 2007.
The global crisis showed that this funding structure had made Austrian banks vulnerable to shocks—
with repercussions for CESEE. After Lehman Brothers defaulted in September 2008, Austrian banks with
major activities in CESEE came under pressure. Almost all of them needed government support, and two had
to be fully or partially nationalized. As it became much more difficult for Austrian banks to obtain new
funding, they stopped or strongly curtailed new funding to their subsidiaries. The result was that the credit
expansion slowed sharply, and in many countries came to a sudden stop.
Since 2008, there has been a gradual reduction in Austrian banks’ external assets and liabilities. Net
issuance of debt has been negative since 2009, and the stock of outstanding bonds has fallen from
US$173 billion to US$132 billion. On the asset side, Austrian banks have reduced their cross-border funding
to CESEE, as their subsidiaries have gradually shifted their funding mix away from parent bank funding
towards funding from local deposits. This mix has shifted as a result of both demand and supply factors, the
relative importance of which has varied over time and by country.2 In the aftermath of Lehman Brothers and
from mid 2011 (when the euro area crisis intensified), supply factors were important, notably rising funding
costs and tighter credit conditions. Later on, when economic growth had weakened, demand factors became
increasingly important. As credit demand in many countries was weak, while deposit growth was relatively
robust, it became attractive for subsidiaries to pay back parent funding. The macro-prudential guidance
issued by the Austrian supervisor in 2012 may also have played a role.
In short, Austrian banks are an important intermediator of Western European savings into CESEE. This
has increased the pool of funding for CESEE, and allowed capital to flow from richer to poorer countries.
However, the transmission works not only in good times, but also in bad times: when financial markets in
Western Europe dry up, CESEE feels the impact.

Austria’s public expenditure-to-GDP
ratio is high (Figure 8). It is well above the EU
average, and 7 percentage points higher than in
Germany. More positively, it has increased less
than in most other countries during the past
decade, reflecting the absence of procyclical
expenditure surge during the boom years and
solid GDP growth (Figure 9).

27.
The counterpart of Austria’s elevated
spending level is a high tax burden, especially on labor. Austria’s tax wedge on labor is one of
the largest in the OECD (Figure 10). This has contributed to relatively low employment among the
low-skilled20 and a high share of part-time workers, including among women (Figure 11).21 And with
tax brackets not indexed to inflation, the tax burden tends to drift up over time, holding back
growth of real disposable incomes.

Austria’s structural deficit is not high, but as this deficit excludes a number of
expenditures, including for bank support, debt dynamics are not as favorable (Figure 12). On
current plans, the structural deficit will decline from 1 percent of GDP in 2013 to ½ percent of GDP
from 2016 onwards. Due to bank restructuring costs,22 the debt ratio will decline only from

In 2013, the employment rate of the low-skilled was 48 percent, compared with 79 percent for the higher skilled.

21

See 2013 IMF Staff Report and related Selected Issues Paper. The low employment rate among older workers also
mirrors relatively generous (early) retirement rules and benefits.
22

In 2014, the restructuring of Hypo Alpe Adria will boost the headline deficit by 1.2 percent of GDP, and will add
4½ to 5 percent of GDP to debt directly, propelling the debt ratio to around 80 percent of GDP. Bank restructuring
costs are the main driver for an increase of the headline deficit to above 2½ percent of GDP, up from 1½ percent in

75 percent in 2013 to around 70 percent in 2020.23 As a result, from 2014 on, Austria will have the
highest debt ratio among European AAA countries and be relatively more exposed to changes in the
currently low interest rate environment. While debt is sustainable within the medium-term horizon
of the Fund’s debt sustainability analysis (DSA),24 in the next decade, without further reforms, aging
cost will lead to upward pressures on the deficit that would reverse debt dynamics.25
29.
Comparisons with other countries show several areas where spending stands out
(Figures 13 and 14).


Old-age social benefits are high in spite of a still relatively favorable old-age dependency ratio.
Austria has a lower old-age dependency ratio than Germany, but Austria’s spending exceeds
that of Germany by 3½ percentage points.



Subsidies and capital transfers are about 3¾ percentage points of GDP higher than the euro
area26 average. While this partly reflects support to banks and accounting differences,27 even
abstracting from support to banks and hospitals, subsidies and capital transfers are
2¼ percentage points of GDP higher than in Germany. Significant savings could be made by
reducing aid to railways, and by better targeting and avoiding duplication of other subsidies.28



Health care spending is relatively high. OECD analysis suggests that Austria could save about
2 percentage points of GDP in health care spending, without endangering outcomes. A
particular problem is the inefficiently large number of hospitals.

30.
Spending levels are also boosted by complex intra-governmental financing
arrangements and lack of subnational tax autonomy, which provides little incentive to contain
spending at the sub-national level.

2013. The structural and even more so the headline deficit were lower than expected in 2013 at respectively 1 and
1½ percent of GDP, due to unbudgeted windfalls from the auctioning of telecom licenses that over-compensated
higher-than-anticipated capital transfers to restructuring banks.
23

The debt projections assume that the Hypo Alpe Adria defeasance structure will recover about 2 percentage points
of the transferred asset in the amount of some 5½ percent of GDP until 2020. The projections do not yet take
forthcoming revisions to GDP and the perimeter of general government into account, which will take place in the
context of the introduction of ESA2010.
24

See Annex I.

25

The latest official projections foresee an increase in old-age related spending (pensions, health and long-term care)
from an already high level of 23.8 percent of GDP in 2015 to 28.3 percent of GDP in 2050.

The mission and the authorities agreed
that the tax burden on labor was too high and
should be reduced. While the current debate in
Austria focuses on reducing income taxes only (the
most prevalent idea is reducing the lowest income
tax bracket from 36 to 25 percent), the mission
argued that consideration should also be given to
lowering social security contributions, which start at
a level well below the threshold for income
taxation.

Policy Discussions

32.
Views within Austria differed on how a
tax cut should be financed. This is partly because specific proposals for the design of a tax reform
were still being elaborated, and a tax reform commission chaired by the Ministry of Finance had just
had its inaugural meeting. But there is also considerable disagreement between the two coalition
partners. The Social Democrats advocate a revenue-neutral tax reform, with a lower income tax
financed by higher net wealth and inheritance/gift taxes. In contrast, the conservative Austrian
People’s Party argues that tax reductions should be funded through expenditure cuts. Current
expenditure plans, however, leave no room for cutting taxes.
33.
The mission argued that a meaningful reduction of the tax burden on labor would
only be possible if expenditures were addressed. It acknowledged that there was some scope for
financing labor tax reductions by selectively abolishing tax exemptions and increasing real estate
and environmental taxes. Real estate taxes are particularly low, reflecting both low rates and low
valuations.29 But it cautioned that the yield of such measures should not be overestimated, and
warned that revenue-neutral tax reforms tend to be

specifically, it argued that

The real estate tax is levied at a basic federal rate of 0.2 percent, multiplied by a municipal coefficient (up to
500 percent), which generally means a tax rate of 1 percent on the tax values (unit values determined in 1970–80s
tend to be far below the market values).

structural surplus of ½ percent of GDP should be maintained until the pre-crisis debt level of
60 percent is reached in the first years of the next decade (Figure 12). This would create
sufficient buffers for absorbing aging cost, potential additional bank restructuring outlays, and
other contingent liabilities (including residual risks from Austrian banks’ CESEE exposure).


Additional expenditure cuts would create room for reducing social contributions and
labor taxes. Such a reduction should put a major emphasis on reducing high social security
contributions, which also affect income levels below the relatively high threshold at which
income taxation kicks in. To reduce Austria’s overall taxation level, social security contribution
and tax cuts should be financed and phased in together with well specified expenditure
reductions, while ensuring that the more ambitious fiscal balance target will be met. In addition,
a streamlining of the tax system through a selective abolition of tax exemptions and the increase
of environmental and real estate taxes could create some additional room for lowering the
burden on labor.

35.
Interlocutors agreed with the mission’s assessment that aggregate spending is too
high, but referred to political obstacles when specific expenditure reductions were discussed.
On an abstract level, counterparts agreed that expenditure levels for pensions, subsidies, and health
care could be reduced, but when it came to discussions about specific reform options, they referred
to numerous political obstacles either within the governing coalition or in the relationship between
the federal and the state levels.
36.
Interlocutors did not have strong views on whether a more ambitious longer-term
fiscal deficit target than currently pursued was needed. In large part this was because they were
focused on the achievement of their 2016 structural deficit objective of ½ percent of GDP. Some
wondered whether more fiscal consolidation would be desirable given the weak economic situation
in Europe. The mission pointed out that extra consolidation would only be required after 2016, when
the recovery was hopefully well established.

Box 3. The Scope for Fiscal Expenditure Rationalization in Austria
In the past decade, Austria’s government expenditure growth has been very steady, thus avoiding the
boom-bust pattern of some other European countries. However, expenditure levels are relatively high,
and the difference with Germany has been widening. Compared with other countries, spending is
particularly high for pensions, capital transfers and subsidies, including in the transport sector. Potential for
efficiency gains appears to exist in health care spending.
In the past decade, Austria’s expenditure to GDP ratio has increased less than in most other EU
countries, although the starting level was already high (Figure 8). This is the result of relatively modest
expenditure growth, and robust GDP growth.
At the same time, Austria has managed to avoid the boom-bust in public expenditure that
characterized some of the other European countries (Figure 9). With no expenditure surge in the precrisis years, the government was not forced to retrench expenditure post 2009. The absence of an
expenditure boom in Austria partly reflects the absence of a revenue boom.
Nevertheless, Austria’s expenditure to GDP level is high compared with other countries. The
expenditure to GDP ratio was 51.7 percent in 2012, 1.6 percentage points higher than the euro area-12 (EA12) average. The difference with Germany—a country that has also come through the crisis relatively well—is
much larger (7 percentage points in 2012) and has widened significantly over the past decade.
A cross-country analysis of public spending by different type of categories shows several areas where
spending stands out. Looking at main categories by economic and functional classification1 in Austria and
its peer countries2, Austria’s expenditure is particularly high for subsidies in health care (hospital services)
and in economic affairs (transport sector), for capital transfers in economic affairs (transport sector and bank
rescues), and for social benefits in social protection (to a large extent old-age pensions) (Figure 13).
Public pension spending is high and will increase further due to aging. Current high spending reflects
both a high replacement rate and low effective retirement age. While the old-age dependency ratio is still
relatively favorable, this will change going forward. According to the European Commission (EC) 2012
Ageing Report, the old-age dependency ratio3 in Austria is projected to increase by about 23 percentage
points between 2015 and 2050 (Figure 14). As a result, spending on pensions will rise further—the latest
official projections foresee an increase in public pensions spending from 13.9 percent of GDP in 2015 to
16.4 percent in 2035, one of the highest in the euro area.4
Raising effective and statutory retirement ages would help mitigate cost pressures. The 2012 pension
reform is a step in the right direction (and current official projections already assume a rise in the effective
retirement age and in the labor force participation among the 55–64 years old),5 but, according to the OECD,
further adjustments may be needed, such as raising the deduction in case of early retirement from currently
5.1 to above 6 percent to achieve full actuarial neutrality and a more rapid increase of the statutory
retirement age6 for women, which is not currently envisaged.7 Developments in the effective retirement age
and employment rate among older workers are intended to be closely monitored so as to take additional
measures if necessary.
Austria’s subsidies and capital transfers are among the highest in the region, even abstracting from
support to banks and hospitals (Figure 13). Given Austria’s peculiarity in accounting for public
expenditure in health, in particular for hospital services,8 we subtract subsidies for hospital services from the
total amount of subsidies. Excluding in addition capital transfers due to bank rescues, Austria’s expenditure
on subsidies in broad sense is still one of the highest in the region (3.9 percent of GDP in 2012) and by
2.3 percentage points higher than in Germany. The biggest bulk of these subsidies goes into the transport
sector (mainly railways, OeBB), both in form of subsidies and capital transfers. As the “Administrative Reform
Working Group” points out, the Austrian system of subsidies and transfers has many deficiencies such as
insufficient targeting, unsatisfactory ex-post evaluation, and transparency gaps that allow for multiple

20

funding. While the government plans to extend the coverage of the transparency databank for public
subsidies to incorporate states and municipalities and to increase efficiency of capital transfers provided to
OeBB,10 the effectiveness of these measures in reducing subsidies in Austria is still to be assessed.
Potential for efficiency gains appears to exist in health care spending. According to the OECD, health
care spending in Austria could be reduced by 2 percentage points of GDP without adversely affecting
outcomes, if Austria’s health care system was operating at the frontier level of efficiency. 11 In particular
spending on hospital services—the main contributor to the high health expenditure—suffers from efficiency
concerns,12 not least due to fragmentation between spending and funding responsibilities between different
levels of government. In the context of the health care reform 2013, the authorities plan to limit nominal
health expenditure growth to nominal GDP growth by 2016 and keep it at the expected average nominal
GDP growth (3½ percent) beyond 2016. However, the reform lacks concrete measures to reach the defined
targets and could be further strengthened also by setting more ambitious goals for shifting from inpatient
to outpatient care and by reinforcing preventive health care.

According to the economic classification, total government expenditure is divided into intermediate consumption and
taxes, compensation of employees, subsidies, property income, social benefits and social transfers in kind, other current
transfers, capital transfers, and gross capital formation. Functional classification splits expenditure into ten functional
groups such as general public services; defense; public order and safety; economic affairs; environmental protection;
housing and community amenities; health; recreation, culture, and religion; education; and social protection.

C. Raising Potential Growth Through Higher Labor Productivity
Background
37.
High labor utilization has made Austria’s per capita GDP one of the highest in Europe.
Per capita GDP is 12 percent higher than in Germany, and exceeded only by Switzerland and Iceland
(Figure 15). Labor productivity does not stand out as much: it is lower, for example, than in Belgium,
Netherlands, France and Germany, although high productivity in some of these countries may be the
flipside of their low employment ratio.30

38.
Taking a global rather than regional
perspective, per capita GDP is well below the
US—the result of lower productivity (Figure 16).
Productivity per hour in Austria is almost 20 percent
lower than in the US, which explains why per capita
GDP is 13 percent lower, despite higher labor input.
Moreover, labor productivity stopped catching up
with the US in the mid 1990s, and has since fallen
behind. Relatively low labor productivity is all the
more striking given that capital intensity of
production in Austria is high.

Falling productivity growth has also
affected potential output growth (Figure 17). The
decline in potential growth preceded the global

a reduction in the growth rate of labor productivity,
which peaked in the late 1990s and has been on a
downward trend since.

also visible in the productivity of capital which
has fallen steadily in the past few decades. This
decline is strikingly different from the increase observed in the US, the UK, the Netherlands, and the
Scandinavian countries (Figure 18).



Lower adaptation of IT. It is striking that in the
past decade the largest differences with the US
have been in manufacturing and IT (Figure 16).



Cultural attitudes towards risk taking, and limited
“second chances” for those who had experienced
bankruptcy.





Lack of private financing for start-ups. This may
be due to the bank-based financial system, which
mainly provides financing to existing firms, and
provides little venture capital to new startups.

The mission pointed out that raising the
effective retirement age would further raise
potential output, by raising labor supply. This
would be particularly important as the population
ages, as raising the retirement age would limit the
shrinkage of the working force.

STAFF APPRAISAL
43.
Austria has come through the global economic and financial crisis relatively well,
reflecting the absence of large pre-crisis domestic imbalances. Employment and output have
recovered to well above 2008 levels, and unemployment has remained low by international
standards. The main impact of the crisis has been on the banking sector and public debt.
44.
With the recovery taking hold, this is a good time to resolve crisis legacies and address
long-standing structural issues. The agenda includes: completing bank restructuring and
strengthening macro-financial stability; expenditure reforms to bring down debt and taxes; and
boosting potential growth by moving closer to the technology frontier and raising labor force
participation.
45.
Austria has a high tax burden, especially on labor, and an elevated public expenditure
level. This partly reflects social choices, including a generous social safety net. But spending is also

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

AUSTRIA

higher than in countries with similar social models, such as Germany. In addition, debt dynamics are
not as favorable as the low structural deficit suggests. The debt ratio will decline only from
75 percent in 2013 to around 70 percent in 2020. And in the next decade, aging costs will lead to
upward pressures on the deficit that, without further reforms, will reverse debt dynamics.
46.
More decisive expenditure and fiscal federalism reforms would help create room for
both faster debt reduction and tax cuts. Expenditure cuts of about 1 percent of GDP by 2018
would lead to a structural surplus of ½ percent of GDP and bring down debt faster, thus creating
buffers for absorbing aging cost, potential additional bank restructuring outlays, and other
contingent liabilities. Additional expenditure cuts beyond this relatively modest amount would
create scope to reduce the tax burden on labor, including from social security contributions.
47.
Key expenditure reforms would include: (i) increased statutory retirement ages, including
through faster unification of male and female statutory retirement; (ii) closing the gap with effective
retirement; (iii) deeper cuts and ultimately better targeting of subsidies, including through the reevaluation of expensive infrastructure projects; and (iv) more ambitious health care reforms. A closer
link of expenditure and revenue responsibilities through the introduction of meaningful tax
autonomy at the subnational level would further help prioritize expenditure. These reforms should
be decided in conjunction with the next medium-term fiscal framework 2015–19.
48.
The restructuring of fully or partly nationalized banks has made progress. The sale of
the Hypo SEE subsidiaries should now be completed as rapidly as possible, while continuing to avoid
disruptive effects in host countries. While bailing in of subordinated debt is in line with the European
frameworks and will help reduce resolution costs and moral hazard, the retrospective effective
voiding of the state of Carinthia’s guarantee on €890 million of such debt—while designed and
intended as an isolated case—would undermine the credibility of similar guarantees issued by other
sub-national bodies. For the Volksbanken sector, speedy asset disposal in the apex institution
(OeVAG) and rapid implementation of a streamlined association structure with a smaller number of
institutions remain essential in light of a domestic banking market with structurally low profitability.
49.
The transition toward a new funding model and the strengthening of capital positions
have reduced vulnerabilities of internationally active banks, but risks remain. As in the past,
further transition steps to the new funding model should not be implemented abruptly so as to
avoid unduly restraining credit growth in still nascent recoveries. The capital positions of large
internationally active banks have been strengthened, but further efforts are needed; and risks
remain, including from exposures to Russia and Ukraine.
50.
The national transposition of the European Banking Union framework should proceed
swiftly. Important steps include the designation of a national resolution agency, pre-funding and
streamlining the deposit guarantee schemes, and further progress on the macroprudential front.
51.
Boosting potential output by raising labor productivity and increasing labor force
participation would improve longer-term economic prospects and help mitigate the impact of
aging. Enhancing IT adaptation, expanding access to financing for start-ups and reducing

24

AUSTRIA

administrative barriers for new businesses would all help expand the economy’s production frontier.
Increasing the labor force by reducing the tax burden on labor and raising the effective retirement
age would further boost economic potential.
52.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Austria be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

1/ The trajectory "no policy change" illustrates debt dynamics under the assumption that the 1/2 percent of GDP
structural deficit target can be maintained from 2016 until 2020 because past reforms show success, aging costs are
absorbed through expenditure cuts in other areas, or tax and social security contributions are increased. From 2021
onwards, it is assumed that this is no longer possible and aging cost increases fully impact the deficit.
2/The trajectory "staff recommendation" illustrates debt dynamics under assumption that a structural surplus of 1/2
percent of GDP will be reached by 2018 and maintained until 2022 (when debt has fallen to 60 percent of GDP). From
2023 onwards, it is assumed that this is no longer possible and aging cost increases fully impact the deficit.

Table 7. Austria: Authorities’ Response to Past IMF Policy Recommendations
IMF 2013 Article IV Recommendations

Authorities’ Response

Fiscal policy I
Fiscal cost from medium-sized banks under
restructuring should be compensated with additional
gradual fiscal adjustment, with a view to bringing
public debt down to its pre-crisis level in the first
years of the next decade.

No gradual strengthening of fiscal adjustment
beyond the 2016 structural deficit target in the fiscal
planning for 2014-18.

Fiscal policy II
Decide on further expenditure reforms to anchor
sustainability in the medium and long run.

No further significant reform plans at the moment.

Fiscal policy III
Streamline intergovernmental fiscal relations and
create stronger nexus between spending and
financing responsibilities at the subnational level,
including by introducing meaningful tax autonomy
for states.

No significant progress.

Fiscal policy IV
Generate and use expenditure savings to finance a
comprehensive reform of labor taxation and social
and family benefits to foster labor supply and
potential growth.

No significant progress.

Financial sector policy I
Dispose more efficiently of legacy assets in
restructuring banks and downsize these banks faster
to contain final fiscal cost.

Strategy for main problem bank has been decided;
further progress in the troubled apex institution of
one banking group; however, one bad bank still has
banking license.

Financial sector policy II
Create comprehensive framework for bank
resolution.

Preparations for the transposition of the new EU
Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive are ongoing.

Financial sector policy III
Strengthen the macroprudential framework by
giving the OeNB a decisive role in the new
macroprudential committee, broadening the set of
macroprudential tools, and improving the statistical
information base.

Committee has not yet started to work, OeNB role
could be stronger, macroprudential tools still need
to be broadened.

Financial sector policy IV
Unify deposit insurance system and create bank
resolution fund.

No progress on plans for unifying the deposit
insurance system.

Annex. Austria: Public Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
Debt is sustainable within the DSA medium-term projection horizon, but aging cost pressures are
looming in the longer term. In 2014–19, debt will gradually fall from currently around 80 percent of
1
GDP to slightly above 70 percent of GDP in the baseline. A relatively high share of public debt held
by non-residents could increase volatility in times of heightened CESEE concerns. Lower growth and
a contingent liability shock could shift up debt significantly but would leave it on a downward
trajectory. In the longer term and barring policy measures, aging cost pressures would reverse the
debt path.2
Baseline
Growth is accelerating, and fiscal consolidation is on track. The overall structural adjustment of
around ½ percentage point of GDP between 2014 and 2016 assumed in the baseline is well within
3
reach. Against this backdrop, the debt-to-GDP ratio will peak at almost 80 percent of GDP in 2014,
propped up by the creation of a defeasance structure for Hypo Alpe Adria bank, and gradually fall to
slightly above 70 percent of GDP by 2019. Gross financing needs are moderate.
The standard DSA heat map indicates a high share of public debt held by non-residents as the main
vulnerability. In principle, this should not be a source of concern as long as Austria is perceived a
safe-haven euro area core country. However, it could lead to higher volatility in spreads as a
function of developments in CESEE and residual risks from banks’ CESEE exposure.
Stress Tests
Standardized macro-fiscal stress tests reveal lower growth and the realization of contingent
liabilities as main factors that could shift the debt-to-GDP ratio upwards, even though debt remains
on a downward trajectory.
The standardized low-growth scenario assumes that, in 2015 and 2016, growth is reduced by one
4
standard deviation of the historical growth outturn and amounts to a negative ½ percent. In this
case, the debt-to-GDP ratio would increase by 5 percentage points to a peak of 84 percentage
points in 2016 and follow a downward trend to 79 percentage points in 2019. A purely illustrative
contingent liability shock of 10 percentage points of GDP, about the size of the overall debt effect of
1

Forthcoming revisions to GDP and the perimeter of general government, due to new ESA rules effective as of
September 2014, are not yet included.
2

See figure 12 in main document.

3

The structural balance excludes various one-offs, in particular bank restructuring cost (see table 1 of main
document). Looking at the purely cyclically-adjusted primary balance confirms that the baseline scenario is realistic
(see panel “Austria Public DSA – Realism of Baseline Assumptions”, part one, bottom lhs chart).
4

The scenario also assumes that lower growth induces a reduction in the inflation rate by some ¼ percentage points,
while interest rates are assumed to increase by ½ percentage point (with concurrent effects on the primary balance).

AUSTRIA

bank support during the crisis, would prop up the debt-to-GDP to some 90 percent before a very
gradual reduction to some 86 percent towards the end of the decade.
The other standardized macro shocks will not lead to significant deviations from the baseline debt
path. These shocks are the primary balance shock, the real exchange rate shock, and the real interest
5
rate shock. A “combined shock” for all variables is driven by assumed lower growth and leads to a
similar debt path as in the low-growth scenario.

5

Compared to baseline, the primary balance shock assumes a deterioration of the balance in 2015 and 2016 by half
of the 10-year historical standard deviation; the real exchange rate shock assumes a depreciation of 13.1 percent in
2015 (largest historical depreciation over the last ten years); and the real interest rate shock assumes a spread
increase of 200 bp.

1/ Public sector is defined as general government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over German bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Implementation of HIPC Initiative: Not Applicable
Exchange System:
As of January 1, 1999, the currency of Austria is the euro, which floats freely and independently against
other currencies. Austria’s exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions, with the exception of restrictions notified to the Fund in
accordance with decision No.144-(52/51) resulting from UN Security Council Resolutions and EU
Council Regulations.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Macroeconomic statistics are adequate for surveillance. Austria subscribed to the Fund’s
Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) in 1996, and its metadata are available on the Fund’s
electronic Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. Austria is availing itself of the SDDS flexibility
option on the timeliness of the industrial production index and the merchandise trade data.
2.
The ECB reporting framework is used for monetary statistics and data are reported to
the IMF through a “gateway” arrangement with the ECB. The arrangement provides an efficient
transmission of monetary statistics to the IMF and for publication in the IFS and IFS Supplement.

Economic Developments and Prospects
1.
As in other euro area countries, growth in Q2 was weaker than
expected, while growth in Q1 was revised down. Q1 growth was revised down from
0.2 to 0.1 percent (qoq), mainly due to weaker exports than originally estimated. The
flash release for Q2 points to only a slight growth acceleration to 0.2 percent (qoq).
Export growth picked up, but private

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION—
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

3.
Staff now expects annual GDP growth in 2014 to be about
½ percentage points lower. The new baseline is growth of 1.0 percent in 2014,
compared with 1.5 percent in the staff report.
4.
A strengthening of the economy is now projected for 2015, but
downside risks remain significant. With GDP starting from a lower level, the growth

AUSTRIA

rate (1.9 percent) is projected to be slightly faster than in the staff report (1.7 percent),
which would imply that about 40 percent of the growth shortfall this year would be
made up in 2015. However, the strength of the euro area recovery and the impact of the
geopolitical turmoil remain uncertain at this stage and constitute important downside
risks.
5.
Weaker growth is not expected to have much impact on the structural
deficit in 2014. The headline deficit is likely to be ¼ percentage points higher than was
expected in the staff report.
6.
Financial market conditions have remained stable. Sovereign bond yields
notched further down, although the spread vis-à-vis German Bunds remained steady.
The stock market seems to have stabilized, although bank equities remain fragile. Bank
bond yields have remained flat and banks’ CDS spreads seem to have retreated from a
recent peak.
7.
Inflation has recently risen again and stood at 1.7 percent in both June
and July (yoy) up from 1.5 percent in May, with the services sector continuing to
be a major driver. This deviates from the trend in the euro area and Germany, where
inflation has declined to 0.4 and 0.8 percent.

New Finance Minister
8.
Austrian Finance Minister, Vice Chancellor, and conservative People's
Party (OeVP) leader Mr. Michael Spindelegger resigned on August 26 from all his
political posts, citing differences within his party on tax reform. The resignation
highlights the differences of view in Austria on how an income tax cut should be
financed (¶32 of the Staff Report). The Social Democrats have advocated a revenueneutral tax reform, with a lower income tax financed by higher property and
inheritance/gift taxes. So far, the OeVP had argued that tax reductions should be funded
through expenditure cuts, but calls within the party had been increasing to compromise.
9.
On September 1, Mr. Hans Joerg Schelling, also a member of the
conservative party, was appointed as new Finance Minister. Unlike his predecessor,
Schelling will not take on the positions of party chairman and vice-chancellor—these will
go to Economy Minister Reinhold Mitterlehner. Mr. Schelling held several managerial
positions in the private and public sectors, including as chairman of the supervisory
board of the restructuring apex institution of the Austrian Volksbanken sector. The
appointment of a new OeVP finance minister and party chairman have made an
agreement on tax reform more likely. Expectations are that the coalition will continue
until the next regular national elections in 2018.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 15, 2014

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Austria
On September 8, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Austria.
Austria came through the global economic and financial crisis relatively well, reflecting the
absence of large pre-crisis domestic imbalances. The main impact of the crisis was on the
internationally active banking system and public debt. Before the crisis, Austrian banks had
expanded rapidly in Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe (CESEE). As their funding dried
up post-Lehman, and their assets suffered from the end of the credit boom in CESEE, Austrian
banks came under pressure and needed government support.
After a new slowdown in 2012 and 2013, a recovery is now taking hold. GDP is currently
projected to grow at about 1.5 percent in 2014 and 1.7 percent in 2015, compared with
0.3 percent in 2013. Inflation has fallen from near 4 percent in late 2011 to 1.5 percent in May,
but the risk of deflation remains low, as a tight labor market (with the lowest unemployment rate
is the EU) keeps services inflation elevated. Austria’s current account and real effective
exchange rate are broadly in line with fundamentals. Risks are mainly geopolitical, and include
spillovers from Ukraine and Russia. Other factors include the European Central Bank (ECB)’s
comprehensive balance sheet assessment and lower-than-expected growth in emerging markets
and the euro area. Funding shocks for Austrian banks could give rise to spillovers to CESEE.
Austria’s public expenditure-to-GDP ratio is high. The counterpart is a high tax burden,
especially on labor. With 1 percent of GDP in 2013, Austria’s structural deficit is not high.
However, due to bank support, debt dynamics are not as favorable, and the public debt-to-GDP
ratio will reach about 80 percent of GDP in 2014 and become higher than in any other European
AAA country.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

The restructuring of fully or partly nationalized banks has made progress, but challenges remain.
The restructuring law for Hypo Alpe Adria includes a bail-in of €890 million in subordinated
debt guaranteed by the state of Carinthia and an effective wipe-out of the underlying guarantee.
The internationally active Austrian banks have been shifting to a new model, in which credit of
their CESEE subsidiaries is, to a much larger extent, funded by local deposits rather than by
parents. These large banks have strengthened their capital position, but capital gaps with peers
remain. Neither the non-financial corporate sector nor the household sector is overleveraged, but
housing prices warrant monitoring.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their sound macroeconomic management,
which has helped weather the global financial crisis and deliver stable growth and low
unemployment. Directors noted that, while Austria’s economic outlook remains positive,
geopolitical developments could pose risks, especially to the financial sector given its exposure
to Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe. They agreed that policy priorities ahead should
continue to focus on preserving financial stability by completing bank restructuring and further
strengthening macro-financial stability. Efforts should also continue to address long-standing
structural issues to bring down the high debt and boost labor productivity and potential output
growth.
Directors welcomed the reduction in the fiscal deficit and the authorities’ commitment to achieve
a structurally balanced budget by 2016. They generally saw scope for more decisive expenditure
and fiscal federalism reforms to make room for faster debt reduction and tax cuts, including from
social security contributions. These steps would create buffers for absorbing aging costs,
potential additional bank restructuring outlays, and other contingent liabilities. Directors
highlighted the need for greater public spending efficiency by reforming public pensions and
health care, better targeting subsidies, and by linking more closely expenditure and revenue
responsibilities in the federal system.
Directors welcomed the recent progress in the restructuring of fully or partly nationalized banks,
in particular Hypo Alpe Adria Group. They encouraged timely completion of the sale of Hypo’s
Southeastern European subsidiaries while ensuring measures to avoid disruptive effects in host
countries. Directors recognized that the recent bail-in of subordinated debt is in line with the
European framework. They noted, however, that the retroactive effective voiding of a guarantee
of the Austrian state of Carinthia, while designed and intended as an isolated case, could risk
undermining the credibility of similar guarantees in the future. For the Volksbanken sector,

Directors underscored that, given the structurally low profitability of the domestic banking
market, speedy asset disposal in the apex institution and the rapid implementation of a
streamlined association structure remain essential.
Directors acknowledged that the transition to a new funding model and stronger capital positions
have reduced vulnerabilities of internationally active banks. They encouraged the authorities to
continue to strengthen banks’ capital buffers and to accelerate the implementation of the EU
banking union framework. Directors also highlighted the need for further refinement of the
macroprudential framework.
Directors underscored that raising labor productivity and increasing labor force participation
would improve longer-term economic prospects by boosting potential growth and mitigating the
impact of aging. The enhancement of IT adaptation, better access to financing for start-ups, and
the reduction of administrative barriers for new business could help expand the economy’s
production frontier. Increasing the labor force by reducing the tax burden on labor and raising the
effective retirement age would further boost economic potential.

Statement by Johann Prader, Executive Director for Austria
September 8, 2014

The Austrian authorities welcome the consultations with the Fund and thank staff for the highquality report. They broadly agree with the assessment of Austria's economic and financial
situation and the recommendations on economic and financial policies.
The Austrian economy has weathered the global economic and financial crisis relatively
well, with current employment and GDP above their pre-crisis levels and an increase of the
public expenditure ratio smaller than in most other euro area countries. Against the
background of hesitant investment activity, cautious private consumption and somewhat less
dynamic external demand, Austria’s economic recovery follows the general international pattern
in that its speed and its amplitude are decelerating. At the same time, the financial sector is
proceeding with the repair of balance sheets but with so far only limited impact on domestic real
activity. The rise of the public debt level relates primarily to Austrian government support for
the banking sector throughout the crisis, which has also been helpful in avoiding credit growth
being unduly restrained in the emerging economies of the region. The authorities agree that
policy needs to focus on reducing the tax burden, in particular on labor, while further improving
the sustainability of public finances through a prudent review of revenues and expenditures,
including transfers and subsidies, and adequate measures aimed at increasing the potential of
long-term economic growth and strengthening the domestic banking sector.
Macroeconomic outlook
Since passing the trough of the business cycle in the first half of 2013, the Austrian economy has
embarked on a moderate recovery path in the second half of 2013. But against the background
of weak euro area growth and high geopolitical risks, growth of real GDP in Austria turned
out to be significantly lower than expected in the first half of 2014. Given latest
information from conjunctural indicators the authorities expect real GDP growth to
remain below potential for the rest of 2014. Despite very favorable financing conditions,
investment is expected to accelerate only moderately in the months to come. Enterprises
postpone investment projects given the highly uncertain external business environment. The
authorities share staff’s view that the geopolitical situation in Ukraine and Russia poses a
substantial downward risk to the outlook, with possible ramifications for the financial sector and
the investment climate going forward.
Consumer price inflation in Austria has been among the highest in the euro area as of late
as housing, restaurants, and the prices for other services have been the main drivers. In
contrast, producer prices and the relative evolution of the GDP-deflator suggest that a negative

transmission to external price competitiveness has not materialized, even though vigilance in
terms of price competitiveness is warranted. Against the background of relatively sluggish
growth, employment growth has held up quite well with positive side effects for public finances.
Since a substantial part of the rising supply of labor has been coming from abroad, wage pressure
is expected to remain subdued. Even if the recent acceleration of housing prices has not been
accompanied by any corresponding acceleration of leverage in the private sector, the authorities
agree with staff that the situation in the housing market needs close monitoring for a macroprudential toolkit to be applied if the need arises.
The authorities welcome the staff analysis on the deceleration of productivity. However,
this deceleration does not appear to be a specific Austrian feature, but rather a euro areawide phenomenon. One also needs to be mindful of a whole range of technical statistical factors
that may explain the non-convergence to the productivity level of the United States. The
difference in the production structure in terms of the distribution between higher and lower
value-added sectors – perhaps more so than between higher- and lower-tech sectors – in the
economy may be among the main economic factors explaining the said productivity gap. Staff’s
claim is relatively strong that lower IT penetration in the Austrian economy may be the main
reason; some more empirical evidence from staff would be helpful to substantiate this assertion.
Fiscal policy
The Austrian government pursues the goal to achieve a structurally balanced budget by
2016. The government also remains committed to the additional fiscal measures as formulated in
a letter to the European Commission of May 12, 2014 in order to avoid a significant deviation
from the adjustment path to the Medium-Term Objective as defined by the rules of the European
fiscal surveillance mechanism.
The authorities agree with staff’s analysis that a large part of the recent increase of the
public debt ratio has been due to government support for the financial sector in response to
the economic and financial crisis as well as soon also to the ongoing revision of the ESA
2010 rules for national accounting. The authorities further agree with the assessment that the
tax burden in general and on labor (including via social security contributions) in particular is
very high. Staff’s recommendations for reform are useful.
Since the room for maneuver for raising other taxes to finance the tax reform is rather
limited in the current context, more focus will indeed have to be put on reviewing the
expenditure side. In that respect, the authorities welcome the staff’s elaboration on the
differences of the Austrian expenditure system from peer countries like Germany, in particular in
areas such as health, subsidies and capital transfers as well as pensions. For this latter
expenditure item, from an economic point of view, the three main calibration areas are effective
retirement age, current and future contributions and current and future benefits; putting the

national public pension system on a sustainable footing may require all of these elements to be
addressed.
Financial Sector Issues
The relatively good performance of Austria in the global and financial crisis is partly due
to the absence of pre-crisis domestic financial imbalances. However, vulnerabilities which
stemmed from the international exposure of Austrian banks in Central Eastern and Southeastern
Europe (CESEE) materialized in the aftermath of 2008. During the past years, the build-up of
capital buffers, progress in bank restructuring and the sound macroeconomic environment in
Austria have been important pillars of financial stability in Austria. However, there is no room
for complacency.
The Austrian authorities concur with the staff that the loss absorbing capacity of Austrian
banks has to be further strengthened through the continuous build-up of additional capital.
Although banks have strengthened their capital positions in recent years, they continue to be
lower than those of their international peers. Leverage ratios are yet more favorable compared to
the peer group, reflecting the banks’ focus on a more traditional loan business. A main challenge
remains the persistent pressure on banks’ profitability in their domestic market. They should thus
strive to address structural issues and improve their cost efficiency.
In CESEE, asset quality remains a challenge for the Austrian banks’ subsidiaries abroad.
A potential increase in geopolitical tensions surrounding Russia and Ukraine could affect asset
quality and also profitability. The Austrian authorities thus continuously encourage risk-adequate
provisioning and coverage policies to deal with credit quality issues. In this context, the
European Central Bank’s comprehensive assessment is a useful exercise to further increase the
transparency of the banks’ balance sheets, to quantify known weaknesses and to support
corrective actions to address them.
With respect to concerns that funding pressures on internationally active banks could
constrain credit supply to the real sector in the CESEE host economies, the Austrian
authorities’ assessment is as follows:

First, the liquidity position of Austrian banks is comfortable with low dependence on
wholesale funding. The funding mix of the banks’ subsidiaries has changed towards more
local stable sources of funding as acknowledged by the staff. This shift was guided by a set of
macroprudential guidelines (“Sustainability Package” as of 2012). It was a decisive move to
encourage banks to further improve their liquidity situation and strengthen their capital base.


Second, the Austrian authorities are closely monitoring the international exposure of
Austrian banks, which has remained broadly stable during the past years, while the CESEE
region has become increasingly heterogeneous. Banks have thus adjusted their regional
portfolios and reduced their business in countries which display macroeconomic and/or
political vulnerabilities (e.g. Ukraine). Such shifts should be regarded as a standard business
procedure in a changing market environment, but warrant caution if they lead to a higher
concentration of profits and banks‘ risk exposure to individual countries.

From a general macroprudential perspective, a gradual reduction in leverage is a welcome
development. It helps adapting banks’ balance sheets to the post-crisis environment. In contrast,
high loan growth at interest rates that do not cover credit, liquidity, and systemic risk costs is not
a sustainable policy objective. It leads to the misallocation of capital and risk in the economy,
which are both disruptive to financial stability and sustainable economic growth.
The Austrian authorities concur with the report that the completion of bank restructuring
and a firm institutional setup is crucial for financial stability. In particular, the
implementation of the European Banking Union framework should proceed swiftly, with the
establishment of the national resolution agency and the pre-funding of the deposit guarantee
scheme.
As regards macroprudential policy in Austria, the responsible authority, the Financial
Market Stability Board, has been established. It aims at fostering cooperation among the
Austrian authorities and mitigating systemic and cyclical risks. Since the IMF team’s visit end of
June, the Board’s members have been appointed and first meetings are scheduled in autumn
2014.
