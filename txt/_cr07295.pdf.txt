ICELAND
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2007 Consultation with Iceland
Approved by Alessandro Leipold and Carlo Cottarelli
July 26, 2007
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background: Following three years of rapid economic expansion, some signs of slowing have
emerged. However, large macroeconomic imbalances have built up and the projected return of
private consumption to a sustainable level may be delayed. Icelandic banks have expanded
rapidly, both at home and abroad, and firms, households, and the country, have become heavily
indebted. Monetary policy tightened throughout the upswing, but mortgage market competition
between the banks and the state-owned Housing Financing Fund (HFF), among other factors,
limited its effectiveness. A large trading-partner-interest-rate differential has appreciated
Iceland’s freely floating currency and staff estimate current overvaluation to be 15–25 percent.
Fiscal policy tightened as the economy expanded, but was eased in early 2007. With core
inflation outside the central bank’s tolerance range, risks of renewed momentum in
consumption, tight labor and goods markets, and much-diminished but large current account
deficits likely to persist in the near term, discussions focused on the policies needed to quickly
restore macroeconomic balance and ways to reduce future macroeconomic volatility.
Authorities’ views: There were differences in views on the need for continued restraint. While
the central bank noted that core inflation pressures remained strong with upside risks
predominant, the fiscal authority anticipated economic slack appearing this year and inflation
returning to target next year. While there was agreement that reforming the HFF would
increase the effectiveness of monetary policy, it was noted that it could take several years to
achieve. Merit was seen in further strengthening the fiscal framework and banks were viewed
to have responded effectively to supervisor’s and investors’ concern in 2006.
Staff views: Given the risks in private consumption and absence of slack, additional restraint is
necessary to re-anchor inflation at the target and ensure restoration of external balance. Fiscal
policy will need to make a contribution and the HFF must be reformed quickly to increase the
effectiveness of monetary policy. Along with other measures to ensure fiscal policy provides
greater macroeconomic stabilization, spending ceilings need to be binding. The banking sector
appears well-placed to withstand significant credit and market shocks. However, given the
rapid expansion and increasing complexity of banks’ businesses, continued vigilance and
further development of stress testing and risk management techniques is crucial. Following the
mission, initial steps were taken regarding the HFF and the central bank announced that policy
would need to be tight for longer to achieve the inflation target.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
After three years of rapid economic expansion, signs of a much-needed slowing
remain mixed. Aluminum-sector investment projects stimulated domestic demand, driving
up the level of GDP by more than 20 percent over four years. Private consumption boomed
as easing in household credit conditions, reductions in income taxes, rapidly rising housing
and equity wealth, and relatively

investment eased. Private
consumption growth also slowed, in part because of rising import prices from currency
depreciation in early 2006. More recently, indicators suggest that the projected return of
private consumption to a more sustainable level may be delayed. Cuts in taxes in the first half
of 2007, currency strength, and renewed house price appreciation have restored consumer
confidence.

Record imbalances built up during the boom. The positive output gap is estimated
to have reached over 5 percent in 2005, declining modestly to 3½ percent in 2006.
Unemployment, at 1 percent, has reached its historical low. These pressures in goods and
labor markets drove inflation outside the central bank’s tolerance range. CPI inflation peaked
at over 8 percent in 2006 and the recent decline primarily reflects reductions in VAT and
excise taxes that took effect in March. Demand pressures have also been felt in asset markets,
with equity prices quadrupling over the last three years and real house prices doubling over
the past four years. The boom has been funded externally, with the current account deficit
reaching 27 percent of GDP in 2006, reflecting large deficits on both the income and trade
balances. Net external debt now stands in excess of 200 percent of GDP and household debt
is close to 250 percent of disposable income.

Monetary policy tightened throughout the upswing and the inflation-targeting
framework evolved. Since its trough of 5.3 percent in May 2004, the annualized policy rate
has been steadily increased to 14¼ percent. In addition, the central bank has been improving
communications to help anchor inflation expectations. In the fall of 2005, it began
announcing a schedule for policy meetings that conclude with a public statement outlining
the decision. Shortly after, it began publishing the central bank staff’s view of the interest
rate path required to return inflation to target. This now constitutes the baseline forecast in
the Monetary Bulletin, the central bank’s key policy communications publication. In the
March Monetary Bulletin, the central bank’s forecast indicated that to return inflation to
target, the policy rate would stay at 14¼ percent until end-2007, and could ease gradually
thereafter.
4.
Despite the policy initiatives, the effectiveness of monetary policy was
undermined by several factors. First, easing in lending criteria and changes to funding
strategies at the publicly owned Housing Financing Fund (HFF) sparked a competitive battle
with the private banks.1 For a sustained period while the policy rate rose, real mortgage rates
declined. Further, banks introduced mortgage products that newly allowed households to
borrow against their
housing equity. Throughout

Third, low international interest rates and abundant liquidity enabled Icelandic firms to
borrow in foreign currency at low rates. Finally, the krona (ISK) Eurobond carry trade
enabled banks access to ample funding at relatively attractive rates to finance domestic credit
expansion.

Banks remain profitable and well capitalized, but risks remain. Banks posted
record profits in 2006 as diversification across businesses and countries mitigated pressures
on margins at home. Almost half of the banks’ 2006 income was generated outside Iceland.
Household and corporate customers are heavily indebted, but credit quality appears high with
a non-performing-loan ratio of roughly 0.5 percent. Further, household disposable income
growth has been strong and most corporates borrowing in foreign currency are naturally
hedged. Liquidity risk has been reduced, with 2007 maturing debt already pre-funded, and
sources and instruments diversified. Cross and related-parties holdings of equity have been
sold down, increasing ownership transparency and reducing the risks associated with
connected lending. At end-2006, banks had Tier 1 capital ratios in excess of 10 percent and
financial supervisor (FME) stress tests suggested that the banking groups had sufficient
capital to withstand a combination of extreme credit and market shocks. However, the rapid
pace of credit growth suggests that credit quality could become a concern in the event of a
sharp domestic downturn and the banks’ high reliance on international capital markets for
funding could leave them vulnerable to market shocks.

The record current account deficit of 2006 and credit downgrades this year
caused little disruption. Unlike during a similar period last year, the króna has remained

strong and confidence in the Icelandic banks
stayed high as indicated by their equity prices
and credit default swap spreads. In addition to
reflecting the banks’ improved risk profile,
this may also be due to a greater
understanding in international capital markets
of Iceland’s unique circumstances. The banks
have done a better job of explaining their
business model and emphasizing that the size
of the domestic economy can distort the
picture suggested by standard ratios to GDP.

Although the fiscal balance improved during the upswing, a large portion of the
improvement was cyclical, and the policy stance eased in 2007. The fiscal balance swung
from a deficit of almost 3 percent of GDP in 2003 to a surplus of just over 5 percent of GDP
in 2006; the underlying (structural) adjustment was, however, more contained. Standard
cyclical adjustment techniques cut these

II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
8.
With signals of slowing mixed and large imbalances, discussions focused on the
policies needed to ensure that the needed retrenchment occurs smoothly, restoring
balance with minimal disruption. Following previous overheating periods, domestic
demand in Iceland adjusted quickly, restoring balance without long-lived negative
macroeconomic implications. However, the risk of continued strength in private consumption
illustrates that policymakers must ensure that polices are providing appropriate incentives to
achieve this outcome. Further, given the current, and likely growing, pressures that
globalization places on macroeconomic stabilization in small open economies, the design and
implementation of stability-oriented policy frameworks need to continually evolve.3
Accordingly discussions focused on:
•

Monetary policy: the path for policy interest rates that will guard against high
inflation becoming entrenched and measures to improve the effectiveness of the
policy instrument;

•

Financial sector: the authorities’ role in ensuring that banks continue to improve

A. Outlook and Risks

9.
There were important differences in views on the current momentum in the
economy and core inflation pressures. There was agreement that inflation would return to
target and the current account deficit would decline substantially over the forecast horizon,
however, there were differences in timing. Both staff and the central bank saw more
momentum in the economy than the fiscal authority, which saw growth moderating close to
zero in 2007 and then rebounding back close to potential. Different views on the level of
potential output underlie these outlooks with the fiscal authorities’ estimate higher. In all
outlooks, the completion of the aluminum-sector projects underlies the projected decline in
investment. Different views on the sustainable level of private consumption largely account

Independent Currencies.”

for the dissimilar GDP profiles. Staff expect consumption to slow but remain above a
sustainable level in 2007, buoyed by tax cuts, currency strength, income growth, and
continued asset price appreciation. However, increasing real interest rates coupled with
record high household debt and rising import prices are expected to encourage households to
rein in expenditure in 2008. Staff and the central bank estimate that the output gap will
remain positive in 2007, before moving into excess supply in late-2008. The fiscal
authorities, however, estimate that the output gap turns negative in 2007 and inflation returns
to the target sooner. Views on the evolution of the current account were broadly similar, with
staff expecting it to fall by roughly half in 2007 and to under 10 percent of GDP in 2008.
10.
Staff and the central bank viewed the balance of risks to lie on the upside. The
rebound in consumer confidence in early 2007 warns that the retrenchment in private
consumption could be delayed.4 Expectations could be supported by new investment projects
drawing closer.5 Further, the impact of increases in the policy interest rate on household debtservice cost has been muted by competition between the banks and the HFF. In the absence
of HFF reform, it was agreed that monetary policy is likely to have only a limited impact on
households. Should consumption not ease as forecast, demand pressures will keep inflation
and interest rates high, delaying re-equilibration in the exchange rate from its currently
overvalued level.
B. Fiscal Policy
11.
Notwithstanding the risks, the fiscal authorities saw less need and little scope for
tightening the fiscal stance. Although the tax cut portion of the 2007 easing had already
been implemented, staff

additional fiscal restraint given their outlook, and limited scope, particularly in light of the
tightness in labor markets.
12.
The authorities saw merit in strengthening the medium-term fiscal framework.
To help reduce macroeconomic volatility, staff recommend a package of measures to
strengthen the fiscal framework (Box 1). Strengthening the expenditure rules and extending
them to local governments was seen as feasible, as was using parliamentary committees to
increase parliament’s ownership of the ceilings. While agreeing that nominal spending
ceilings would improve the countercyclical impulse from fiscal policy, practical difficulties
were noted given high inflation uncertainty. The authorities also noted that it was not
immediately obvious where an independent forecast to underpin the budget could be
generated.

Box 1: Options for Reforming the Fiscal Framework1
A more rules-based fiscal framework would improve macroeconomic stabilization and Iceland
could look to the reform experiences of countries like Belgium and the Netherlands where
coalition governments are also the norm. Options include:
•

Couch expenditure rules in terms of rolling multi-year expenditure ceilings that are
binding on ministries and local governments. Stop adding expenditure at the legislative
stage and end the use of supplementaries.

•

Switch from real to nominal expenditure ceilings based on the inflation target.

•

Use stakeholder committees to coordinate fiscal policy targets. Strengthen
parliamentary committees to take greater ownership of ceilings.

•

Specify detailed expenditure ceilings for the life of the government as part of the
coalition agreement.

•

Underpin the budget with independent macroeconomic forecasts.

C. Monetary Policy
13.
There was agreement that core inflation pressures remained strong. Although
temporary factors were lowering headline inflation, continued tightness in goods and labor
markets, and the pickup in house price inflation signaled greater core inflation pressures than
expected at the time of the March Monetary Bulletin. It was noted that although immigration
from eastern Europe had eased labor market constraints in construction and services,
shortages of highly skilled workers were generating wage pressures in other sectors. While
seeing the need for further tightening, the authorities noted that increased capital flows could
lead to perverse short-term effects. Ample credit would be available to households and a
further strengthening in the exchange rate could boost consumer confidence. In addition,
delaying the re-equilibration in the exchange rate, which the authorities agreed was
overvalued by 15 to 25 percent due primarily to the impact of high domestic interest rates
(Box 2), could slow needed current account adjustment.6

Following the mission, the July Monetary Bulletin indicated that that the policy rate would need to be held at
its current rate for longer than indicated in the March Monetary Bulletin owing to increased inflationary
pressures. Subsequently, the HFF and banks raised mortgage rates.

14.
The authorities viewed the publication of the path for interest rates required to
return inflation to target as successful. In the March Monetary Bulletin, the central forecast
was based on the interest rate path that the central bank staff viewed necessary to return
inflation to target. It was noted that virtually all market reaction had been positive. Forward
market rates and banks’ interest rate forecasts had moved closer to the central bank’s view,
which had not been the case when this scenario was only included as an alternative.

14
15.
There was unanimous agreement that the competition between the banks and
the HFF was limiting the impact of monetary policy. The HFF funds its mortgage lending
through issues of government-guaranteed long-term indexed bonds. Consequently, its real
mortgage rates only rose as global interest rates rose. The banks fund their ISK mortgage
lending with shorter-term borrowing, the cost of which is affected by the central bank’s
policy instrument. To maintain their share of the mortgage market, banks match HFF rates
and appear to be lending at rates below their cost of funds. This prevents the policy rate from
affecting household debt-service costs and has encouraged banks to increase their foreigncurrency mortgage lending, which can be done more profitably with households bearing the
currency risk. While the authorities agreed that HFF reform would increase the effectiveness
of monetary policy, they indicated that it could take a number of years to implement, in part
because of concerns over ensuring access to adequate mortgage finance throughout the
country.7
D. Financial Stability
16.
Banks responded effectively to the supervisor’s and investors’ concerns in early
2006, though challenges remain. Despite Iceland’s large current account deficit in 2006 and
credit downgrade early in 2007, the banks’ resilience to the market turbulence in March of
this year was cited as evidence of their effective response. The FME noted that because of
Icelandic banks’ high dependence on capital markets for funding, they would always be more
vulnerable to capital market sentiment, and consequently, liquidity management would
always need close monitoring. Banks noted that they have sufficient liquid assets to meet
their business obligations for 12 to 18 months without needing market access. In addition,
banks’ diversification of funding sources suggests that they would continue to have market
access, albeit it at a higher cost of funds, should the ISK Eurobond flows cease (Box 3). At
the same time, it was noted that there is growing importance on banks’ ability to effectively
manage new and more complex risks. It was also noted that the rapid foreign expansion of
the banks had increased awareness of the importance of improved cross-border collaboration,
crisis management planning, and adequate supervisory resources; and progress was being
made on all fronts. For example, Iceland will participate in a Nordic financial system
contingency exercise in September.

7

In IMF Country Report No. 05/366, along with the analysis of the Icelandic mortgage market, staff outlined a
set of guiding principles for reform of the HFF to significantly shrink its role in the retail mortgage market.
These principles were to ensure that the positive aspects of the current system would be retained while allowing
it to evolve in a manner that would strengthen both the transmission of monetary policy and the stability of the
financial sector. On July 2, 2007 following the mission, the Ministry of Social Affairs reduced the maximum
LTV ratio of the HFF to 80 percent and announced that the HFF would shift its lending focus more toward its
social objectives. Commentators see this as the first step in needed HFF reform.

Box 3: Króna-Denominated Eurobond Issues1
ISK Eurobond issuance began in
August 2005. The strength of the market
reflects high domestic interest rates, a strong
króna, search for yield, and buoyant
domestic credit demand. After dropping off

year.

comparative advantage. Highly-rated
international institutions can issue króna-denominated bonds to carry-trade investors at lower interest
rates than can Icelandic banks, but still higher than in most international markets. They then offer the
króna to the local banks. In return, local banks borrow foreign currency abroad to swap with the issuer.
The swap interest rate lies between the Eurobond rate and the rate Icelandic banks would have had to
pay.

The sustainability of this activity depends on the attractiveness of króna yields, and investor interest in
Icelandic assets. Market participants note that Iceland is largely seen as an opportunistic investment
rather than a “must hold”, and could be more vulnerable to a sell-off.

17.
Although stress tests suggest that banks have adequate capital to withstand large
shocks, there was agreement that continued development of stress testing techniques
would be important. The stress tests performed by the FME incorporate shocks that are
quite large and the bank-by-bank impact on capital adequacy is published quarterly on the
FME’s website.8 When discussing whether the magnitudes of the shocks were appropriate,
the FME noted that while imbalances in Iceland have grown, the shocks are always
performed relative to the latest data outturns. Consequently, once markets start to move, the
tests track the evolution of capital adequacy quarterly, providing ample lead time to introduce
measures to restore capital buffers if necessary. However, there was agreement that current
methodologies have a weakness as they ignore second-round effects, but this applies to
virtually all stress tests.
18.
Focus has shifted from short-term issues on the banks’ liabilities side to
medium-term issues of credit quality. Despite low default rates, the rapid pace of credit
growth and the extent of household and firm leverage means credit quality could become an
issue. The majority of household debt, however, is long-term and so interest rate risk is low.
Although the bulk of banks’ foreign currency lending is to firms with natural hedges, the
increase in foreign currency lending to the generally unhedged retail, construction, and
8

16
19.
household sectors poses a growing concern. The magnitude of these exposures
remains small, but the growth should be monitored closely because there are indications that
many are underestimating the potential rise in the cost of servicing these loans, expecting the
currency to remain strong, even in the medium term.9
20.
The prospect of financial companies reporting their accounts in foreign currency
has raised concerns. Icelandic financial companies are allowed to keep books and draw up
accounts in their functional currency, which could be foreign.10 While one concern is
technical, the key concern is the potential impact on ISK denominated markets. Currently,
the three large banks are the ISK market makers. If they were to shift their accounting into
another currency, they might discontinue their ISK market activity, with potentially
significant implications for liquidity and the transmission of monetary policy.
E. External Sustainability
21.
The current account is expected to improve sharply, notably slowing the rate of
growth in net external indebtedness. The deficit on the trade balance should improve
significantly in 2007, reflecting increasing exports as aluminum capacity comes on stream
and declining imports due to the completion of the investment projects and moderation in
consumption (the 2007 Q1 current account deficit improved to 9.7 percent of GDP). The
trade balance is forecast to improve further in 2008 and beyond as imports decline with
private consumption returning a sustainable level. The income balance is also forecast to
improve markedly, as the larger proportion of higher income earning FDI and equities in
Iceland foreign assets yields a positive net return.
22.
Although the level of Iceland’s external indebtedness raises concern regarding
sustainability, discussions highlighted several mitigating factors. Debt sustainability
analysis presented in Appendix I illustrates how different macroeconomic shocks could
increase Iceland’s net external debt above the staff’s medium-term baseline, possibly leading
to servicing difficulties. In particular, krona depreciation increases the level of net external
debt notably. These scenarios illustrate that in the event of adverse developments, behavior
will need to adjust to ensure stability. Encouragingly, Iceland’s debt servicing capacity has
grown substantially with the increased capacity in the aluminum sector and households are
wealthy with favorable income prospects. Further, because of the scale and different
composition of Iceland’s foreign assets and liabilities, the net international investment
position (IIP), which shows a considerable stronger net position because it includes direct
investment and equity, exhibits significantly less deterioration under the depreciation
scenario. In addition, as detailed in Appendix I, international accounting standards for

17
valuing different classes of assets imply that even the net IIP may overstate Iceland’s true
level of external indebtedness.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
23.
Iceland’s medium-term prospects remain enviable. Open and flexible markets,
sound institutions, and skillful management of natural endowments have enabled Iceland to
benefit from the opportunities afforded by globalization. However, the growing openness of
international markets can also reduce macroeconomic stability, and the road ahead poses
challenges that policymakers must address to ensure a smooth ride.
24.
Greater macroeconomic stability is needed. In part, the forces of globalization can
be seen in Iceland’s large current account deficits, increasing indebtedness, and persistently
high consumer price inflation, which all reflect the unsustainable pace of domestic demand
growth over the last several years. In the near term, policies will need to tighten to ensure
that domestic demand is reduced, thereby moderating both internal and external imbalances.
Additionally, steps need to be taken to strengthen the ability of both monetary and fiscal
policy to moderate macroeconomic volatility.
25.
Fiscal policy needs to be tighter than budgeted. The tax cuts in early-2007 eased
the fiscal stance prematurely. Measures should be introduced to ensure that domestic demand
pressures moderate sufficiently without relying too heavily on monetary policy. First, the
planned increase in public investment should be slowed. Second, new spending initiatives
should not be introduced until demand pressures have fully abated. Third, in the upcoming
wage negotiations, public sector wage growth needs to be restrained despite labor-market
tightness, and consideration should be given to facilitating the import of skilled labor from
non-EU countries.
26.
To increase fiscal policy’s contribution to macroeconomic stabilization, the
medium-term fiscal framework should be strengthened. Mechanisms need to be
introduced to ensure that general government spending targets are achieved in each and every
year. Explicit agreements between the central and local governments would help achieve this
goal. Further, moving to a framework with nominal spending targets based on the central
bank’s target rate of inflation would lead to a systematically strong countercyclical fiscal
stance.
27.
Monetary policy needs to tighten to ease demand pressures and anchor inflation
expectations. Despite the fall in headline inflation resulting from the reduction in value
added and excise taxes, core inflation pressures are stronger than expected at the time of the
March Monetary Bulletin. Looking further down the road, with currency overvaluation in the
15–25 percent range owing to high short-term interest rates, the currency will at some stage
depreciate to a more sustainable level as inflation is returned to target. When this occurs,
monetary policy must guard against second-round inflation effects.

18
28.
Reform of the publicly-owned HFF is crucial. This is necessary to increase the
effectiveness of monetary policy and reduce the threat to stability from potentially volatile
international capital flows. Competition between the HFF and domestic banks is preventing
the central bank’s policy instrument from effectively reducing domestic demand pressures
and results in short-term interest rates that are much higher than otherwise. Those sectors of
the economy not able to shield themselves from high interest rates may be permanently
damaged. High short-term interest rates are also increasing Iceland’s attractiveness to the
carry trade, appreciating the currency, and increasing external imbalances. As a first step,
HFF lending limits and loan-to-value ratios should be reduced. Subsequently, the
government needs to permanently remove the distortion in the domestic financial market
arising from the presence of the publicly-owned HFF and introduce specifically targeted
programs to ensure access to mortgage funding in all areas of the country.
29.
The financial system withstood the market stress in early-2006 admirably, but
new risks may be emerging. Banks took important steps over the past year to reduce
vulnerabilities and increase resilience. As banks continue to expand rapidly and the
complexity of their operations increases, risk management practices must develop
commensurately and credit risk should be a key focus for banks and supervisors. Lending
growth remains very strong, and while the delinquency rate is low, it is a lagging indicator.
Lending standards and the quality of loan collateral need to be monitored closely. Further,
banks’ foreign-currency lending to households, which has increased sharply, could
potentially become an important indirect credit risk as unhedged households may
underestimate the impact of currency movements on their debt-service costs. Reform of the
HFF would also improve the pricing of risk in the lending market.
30.
Stress tests conducted by the FME suggest that banks have adequate capital to
withstand extreme credit and market shocks. However, these scenarios do not account for
the second-round effects of such shocks and therefore improvements in stress-testing
techniques should continue. Given the rapid expansion of the financial sector, the envisaged
further strengthening of the FME’s resources is welcome. At the same time, the authorities’
emphasis on cross-border collaboration in supervision and crisis management is encouraging.
31.

The next Article IV consultation is recommended to occur on the 12-month cycle.

Appendix I. Iceland: External Debt Sustainability

Significant current account deficit, driven by investment projects plus the expansion of
Icelandic firms and commercial banks abroad, resulted in a sharp increase in external debt,
from about 140 percent of GDP in 2003 to almost 450 percent in 2006. A large part of the
increase is explained by the increased debt of Icelandic banks (86 percent of GDP in
2003 and 373 percent in 2006). In net terms, debt has increased from 101 percent of GDP in
2003 to 203 percent in 2006, while the net international investment position has deteriorated
from -63 percent of GDP in 2003 to -122 percent in 2006.
Under the baseline scenario, the level of net external debt will increase further and stabilize
below 240 percent of GDP. While various shocks could drive debt up further by some
20 percentage points, a 30 percent depreciation in real exchange rate in 2008 could increase
the level of net debt to 364 percent of GDP. However, it should be noted that the baseline
scenario already assumes a return of the real exchange rate to its equilibrium level with most
of the depreciation occurring in 2007–09 (overall misalignment is estimated to be between
15 and 25 percent, see Box 2). While high external indebtedness raises concerns about
Icelandic companies’ ability to service debt, the discussions with the authorities and private
sector representatives indicated that appropriate strategies have been put in place (see
paragraphs 5, 6, 16, and 17 of this report).
One could argue, however, that the net external debt does not produce an accurate picture
given large equity holdings by Icelandic companies. Indeed, under the same scenario IIP
would deteriorate less, from -135 percent of GDP to -186.

An additional caveat is measurement imperfections that get exacerbated when stocks are
sizeable and the composition of assets and liabilities differ. Direct investment and equity,
which represent about 40 percent of Icelandic assets but only 15 percent of liabilities, are
likely undervalued (recorded at book or transaction, rather than market, value). However,

26
debt securities, 60 percent of liabilities, are more accurately measured. If equity and direct
investment instruments (both on the assets and liabilities sides) were undervalued by a third,
then IIP would be undervalued by a third as well.

2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0) and rising inflation
(based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.

Annex II. Iceland: Statistical Issues
Data provision to the Fund is adequate for surveillance purposes. Iceland subscribed to the
Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) in 1996. The Statistics Department (STA)
prepared a data module of the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (data
ROSC) that was published on November 22, 2005.
Data on a wide range of economic and financial variables are provided to the Fund in a
timely manner during and between consultations. In addition to periodic press releases,
statistical information is disseminated to the public through a range of monthly, quarterly,
and annual publications by three main institutions (The Central Bank of Iceland (CBI), the
Ministry of Finance, and Statistics Iceland), and is increasingly available on their internet
sites. Provision of electronic data in English has improved substantially in recent years,
especially from Statistics Iceland.
Iceland is in observance of the SDDS since June 30, 2004, meeting the specifications for
coverage, periodicity, and timeliness, but uses a flexibility option on the timeliness and
periodicity for the production index and the producer price index (PPI). Iceland generally
meets the requirements regarding advance release calendars. However, there are some delays
in the dissemination of data on central government operations and central government debt,
and the advance release dates posted for these data categories are tentative. Also, summary
methodology statements in a number of data categories are neither provided nor posted on
the IMF’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board.
As regards the national accounts data, the authorities shifted to ESA95 in August 2000 and
revised the corresponding time series back to 1990. Another revision was carried out in 2002
going back only to 1997.
The authorities publish Treasury returns on a monthly basis, and quarterly and annual data on
the general government balance. Iceland reports government finance statistics in accordance
with the GFSM 2001 framework in the GFS Yearbook, and is an up-to-date contributor to the
International Financial Statistics (IFS).
Iceland’s balance of payments data deviate from the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual,
fifth edition (BPM5) in certain respects. In particular, the CBI follows the methodology
applied by the European Central Bank (ECB) for the calculation of income payable by
collective investment institutions (e.g., mutual funds). Unlike the BPM5, the ECB’s
methodology includes portfolio investors’ shares of retained earnings in the balance of
payments statement.
Some other departures from BPM5 are: a) income on external debt is compiled on a due-forpayment basis, including between affiliated enterprises; b) debt between affiliated banks is

5
not identified; c) banking sector loans are not classified separately from currency and
deposits; d) in the international investment position, foreign direct investments are valued at
book value; e) external debt is valued at face value; f) financial derivatives held by banks are
not available as on-balance sheet items; and, g) domestic currency deposits held with banks
by nonbank nonresidents are not recorded as part of external debt.
Monetary and financial statistics
The concepts and definitions broadly conform to the guidelines of the Monetary and
Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). Departing from the MFSM, monetary aggregates
include deposits of the foreign sector and the central government; and the currency-linked
and indexed bonds held by nonresidents are classified as domestic instead of foreign
liabilities. Classification and sectorization are mostly in line with the MFSM, except that, in
the accounts of other depository corporations (that is, commercial and savings banks),
financial derivatives are off balance sheet and positions of nonfinancial public corporations
are indistinguishably included as part of government; and, in the accounts of the CBI, fixed
assets are off balance sheet and IMF accounts are included under other items net instead of as
foreign liabilities. The basis for recording follows the MFSM, except that several banks
report loans net of provisions and securities for investment are not at market value. The CBI
has yet to commence reporting monetary data to STA using standardized report forms.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
Iceland
On August 22, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Iceland.1
Background
Aluminum-sector projects and structural changes in domestic financial markets spurred
a sharp increase in domestic demand, boosting real GDP by more than 20 percent in
four years until 2006. However, the boom left Iceland with a legacy of large
macroeconomic imbalances.
The boom in private consumption was facilitated by easing household credit conditions,
tax cuts, rapidly rising housing and equity wealth, and an appreciating real exchange
rate. As a result, the output gap peaked at over 5 percent in 2005, declining only
modestly in 2006. Unemployment fell to a historical low of 1 percent. Pressure in the
goods and labor market pushed inflation well above the central bank’s inflation target,
peaking at 8 percent in 2006. On the external front, the current account deficit widened
to a record 27 percent of GDP in 2006. Net external debt exceeded 200 percent of GDP
at the end of that year and household debt reached almost 250 percent of disposable
income.
In 2007, the investment boom has largely run its course, inflation has fallen below
4 percent and the current account deficit is expected to decline significantly. However,
private consumption has still not fallen to a sustainable level. A much-needed slowdown
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
appeared to be emerging over the course of 2006 as currency depreciation in the first
half of that year raised import prices and hence slowed consumption. But this year a
confluence of factors—Including renewed currency strength, tax cuts in early 2007, and
continued house price appreciation—raised consumer confidence to historical highs
around midyear, which may possibly delay both internal and external adjustment.
Monetary policy tightened during the upswing, with the policy rate rising to 13.3 percent
in December 2006 where it has remained since. But monetary policy effectiveness was
undermined by a competitive battle between the private banks and the publicly-owned
Housing Financing Fund that eased household credit conditions. Consequently, the
policy rate rose by more than would otherwise have been the case, leading to significant
exchange rate appreciation owing to carry trade-related capital inflows. Fiscal policy did
tighten in the upswing, but the fiscal stance eased in 2007.
Record current account deficits and credit downgrades early in 2007 caused little market
disruption, in part reflecting a healthy financial sector. The exchange rate remained
strong and confidence in the Icelandic banks stayed high as indicated by their equity
prices and credit default swap spreads. Credit quality remains high, with low nonperforming loan ratios. Liquidity risk has declined, and cross and related-parties
holdings of equity have been sold down. Financial supervisory stress tests suggested
that banks have sufficient capital to withstand a combination of extreme credit and
market shocks.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors considered that the medium-term prospects for the Icelandic
economy remain highly favorable, reflecting open and flexible markets, sound
institutions, and skillful management of natural endowments. At the same time, record
imbalances have built up during the recent boom, with elevated current account deficits,
growing indebtedness, and persistently high consumer price inflation, all reflecting the
unsustainable pace of domestic demand growth. Accordingly, Directors pointed to the
need for greater macroeconomic stability, and called for policy measures to curb
demand pressures.
Directors stressed that fiscal policy needed to be tighter than budgeted, especially as
the 2007 tax cuts had eased the fiscal stance. They encouraged the authorities to
constrain the growth in public consumption and slow the planned increase in public
investment until domestic demand pressures have fully abated. At the same time, public
sector wage growth should be restrained.
Directors called for the medium-term fiscal framework to be strengthened to increase its
contribution to countercyclical stabilization and relieve some of the burden on monetary
policy. They praised the medium-term expenditure framework underpinned by
expenditure rules, but saw scope for improvement. In particular, Directors called on the
authorities to ensure that the spending targets are met in each year, and noted that
nominal targets based on the central bank’s target rate of inflation could help ensure a

3
countercyclical fiscal stance. Consideration should also be given to extending the rules
to the local government sector, with explicit agreements between different levels of
government.
Directors agreed that further tightening in monetary policy could be required to ease
demand pressures and anchor inflation expectations. They noted that private
consumption was expected to remain strong in 2007, buoyed by tax cuts, a strong
krona, as well as continuing income and asset price growth. Further, core and headline
inflation continues to exceed the target. Directors welcomed recent enhancements in the
central bank’s communication strategy.
Directors generally considered that high domestic interest rates were largely responsible
for the overvaluation of the exchange rate, which they considered temporary with the
currency likely to depreciate over time to a more sustainable level as inflation returned
to target. In this context, they stressed that monetary policy should guard against any
second-round effects.
Directors called for prompt action on reforming the publicly-owned Housing Financing
Fund. They noted that increased competition between the Housing Financing Fund and
the banks is reducing the efficacy of monetary policy, necessitating greater increases in
short-term interest rates than would otherwise be the case, with implications for capital
flows and the exchange rate. While Directors welcomed recent reductions in loan-tovalue ratios at the Housing Financing Fund, they called on the government to
permanently remove the distortion created by the Housing Financing Fund in the
domestic financial market. Equitable access to mortgage funding throughout the country
could still be guaranteed through the introduction of specifically targeted programs.
Directors welcomed the steps taken by banks to reduce vulnerabilities and increase
resilience. They nonetheless stressed the need for risk management practices to
continue evolving, especially as banks continue to expand and face increasing
operational complexity, requiring a continued focus on credit risk. In particular, Directors
noted that banks’ foreign-currency lending to households had grown appreciably, which
could become an important indirect credit risk.
Directors were encouraged by the outcome of stress tests suggesting that banks had
adequate capital to withstand extreme credit and market shocks. Nonetheless, they
called on the authorities to continue to monitor the situation carefully and to take further
steps to improve the stress testing techniques employed. Directors also strongly
supported the authorities’ emphasis on cross-border collaboration in supervision and
crisis management.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
