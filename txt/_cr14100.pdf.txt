STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND ASSESSMENT OF PERFORMANCE UNDER THE STAFFMONITORED PROGRAM

KEY ISSUES
Context: Chad is a fragile country with weak institutional and policy capacity, facing a
trend decline in oil revenues (barring new oil discoveries), and vulnerable to oil price and
regional security shocks. The country is enjoying its longest period of domestic political
stability since independence and has become a beacon of stability in a very volatile
region, actively contributing to international efforts to restore order in Mali and the
C.A.R.. Macroeconomic policy over the last few years has achieved a gradual tightening
of the underlying fiscal policy stance, despite a sizable increase in public investment. A
Staff-Monitored Program (SMP) was approved in July, with the aim of sustaining recent
improvements in macroeconomic outcomes and supporting the implementation of fiscal
structural reforms.
Focus: Discussions focused on two key challenges: (i) ensuring fiscal and debt
sustainability while implementing development plans; and (ii) how to diversify the
economy and make growth more inclusive.
Outlook and risks: The economic outlook is relatively positive driven by a projected
temporary uptick in oil production, with a high risk of debt distress. The main sources of
risk to the outlook stem from the volatility of fiscal oil revenue and the difficult regional
security situation. Negative oil price and production shocks would force downward
adjustments to public investment plans and reduce the availability of foreign exchange.
Regional security instability could require continued elevated levels of security spending
as well as damaging investor confidence.
Recommendations: Fiscal policy should remain anchored on a sustained reduction of
the non-oil primary deficit, supported by public financial management reforms (to
enhance fiscal control and the quality of spending) and sizable increases in non-oil
revenue collection to offset the projected exhaustion of oil revenue (through
enhancements in both tax policy design and revenue and customs administrations). A
more diversified and competitive economy over the medium- and long-terms will
require increased efforts to improve the business environment for the private sector,
promote agricultural activities, and expand access to basic and financial services.

INTRODUCTION
1.
Per capita income has more than doubled since the start of oil production in 2002/03,
but Chad has achieved limited progress in overall poverty reduction and in improving access
to public services (Table 8). Chad is a fragile country with weak institutional and policy capacity,
faces a trend decline in oil revenues, and is vulnerable to oil price and regional security shocks. Chad
was ranked 184th out of 186 countries on the UN‘s 2013 Human Development Index. The slow
progress in human development indicators despite a decade of significant oil revenues has been
due to several factors, in particular the domestic armed conflicts that plagued Chad up to 2009, a
pro-cyclical fiscal policy that transmitted the volatility of oil revenue to government expenditures,
poor governance, and unproductive/inefficient spending—despite substantial public investment,
infrastructure quality remains among the lowest in the region. In addition, relations with the
international community have been strained until very recently and Chad has failed to achieve the
HIPC Completion Point despite reaching the Decision Point back in 2001.
2.
Chad has become a beacon of stability in a very volatile region. The country continues to
enjoy its longest period of domestic political stability since independence. Regional elections are
scheduled to take place by 2015 and legislative and presidential elections by 2016. In the context of
a relatively calm domestic political situation, Chad has had to mobilize resources in response to
security tensions in neighboring countries. Chad actively contributed to international efforts to
restore order in Mali and has had to step up security along the borders with most of its neighboring
countries (i.e., Sudan, Libya, Niger, Nigeria, and the C.A.R.). The intervention in Mali resulted in
additional budgetary outlays in the first half of 2013, but the UN has now taken over the financing
of international security operations in that country. The Chadian authorities have made a request to
the international community to cover the cost of replenishing military equipment deployed in Mali
(estimated at CFAF 160 billion or 3.3 percent of non-oil GDP). Chad faces recurrent spending
pressures from border security and assistance to refugees from Niger, Nigeria, Sudan, and, in
particular, from the C.A.R., from where many Chadian citizens have had to be repatriated.
3.
A Staff-Monitored Program (SMP) was approved by Fund management in July, 20131.
The SMP aims at sustaining recent improvements in macroeconomic outcomes by advancing public
financial management (PFM) reforms and supporting the implementation of Chad‘s new Poverty
Reduction Strategy. In that context, the authorities cancelled the US$2 billion non concessional
Master Facility Agreement (MFA) with Eximbank China that was negatively affecting debt
sustainability prospects as discussed in the 2012 Article IV Consultation report (Box 1). The SMP
envisages a further reduction in the non-oil primary deficit (NOPD) and implementation of key PFM

1

In EBS/13/103 the SMP was characterized as covering the period April to December 2013, reflecting the period
during which the authorities‘ program described in their letter to the Managing Director was to be implemented.
However, consistent with Fund practice, the track record of monitoring should begin no earlier than the point when
substantive policy discussions were first held with the authorities (in this case, at the beginning of June, 2013).

reforms to improve fiscal control and debt and treasury management. Implementation of the SMP
has been supported by stepped up technical assistance by the Fund.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Macroeconomic performance continued to be stable in 2013, with some deceleration
in economic growth and inflation (Figure 1). Real GDP is projected to have grown by 3.6 percent
in 2013, down from 8.9 percent in 2012. Non-oil GDP growth is forecast to have fallen from
11.6 percent in 2012 to 5 percent in 2013, mainly reflecting a return to trend agricultural production
levels after the bumper harvest that took place in 2012. By contrast, oil GDP would likely contract by
4 percent in 2013 on account of a sharper than expected decline in oil production from the mature
fields operated by the Esso-led consortium. Inflation fell sharply in 2013, with the annual average
rate hovering around 0.4 percent toward the end of the year, compared with 7.7 percent in 2012.
Such deceleration resulted mainly from a sizable fall in food prices following the high levels of
agricultural production in 2012 and took place despite the fact that some prices (i.e., cement and
fuel products) were liberalized and/or increased to cost recovery levels.
5.
Fiscal policy has been gradually tightened over the last few years. The non-oil primary
deficit (NOPD)2 fell by 1 percent of non-oil GDP over 2011-12 and the 2013 budget was anchored
on a further 1 percent of non-oil GDP reduction in the NOPD to 18.2 percent of non-oil GDP based
on a significant increase in non-oil revenue and a lower level of security-related spending. The
revised 2013 budget approved in July maintained the original NOPD target despite the addition of
unexpected additional security spending in the order of 0.6 percent of non-oil GDP (linked to Chad‘s
participation in Mali‘s international military campaign, provision of humanitarian assistance to
refugees coming from the C.A.R., and enhanced security in the borders)3 and a downward revision in
oil and non-oil revenue projections (of about 2¼ percent and 1 percent of non-oil GDP,
respectively). The resulting financing needs (of close to 7 percent of non-oil GDP) were to be
accommodated through large placements of debt in regional markets, withdrawal of Treasury
deposits, and a moderate cut in primary expenditure (1.4 percent of non-oil GDP).
6.
While the authorities were on track to achieve the NOPD target, a larger than
expected fall in oil revenue will likely lead to a sizable overall fiscal deficit in 2013. The NOPD
over the first nine months of 2013 was 13.6 percent of annual non-oil GDP, in line with the budget
annual target. Oil revenues are expected to be about CFAF 120 billion (2.4 percent of non-oil GDP)
below budget target, implying an overall fiscal deficit of about 6 percent of non-oil GDP (compared
to a surplus of 1.7 percent of non-oil GDP in 2012). The shortfall in oil revenues is due to a variety of
2

Policy discussions and implementation of fiscal policy in Chad are anchored on the NOPD (as a better
representation of the underlying fiscal policy stance) and a limit to the debt-to-GDP ratio (to control external
financing). The NOPD concept used in Chad corresponds to the non-oil basic fiscal balance (i.e., excluding oil
revenue, grants, and foreign financed investment).

That amount does not include the cost of replenishing military equipment deployed in Mali (see ¶2).

factors, most of them temporary: (i) setbacks to the gas-powered electricity generation system
forced the Esso-led consortium to lower its production levels and to run higher production costs by
relying on diesel and fuel oil; (ii) delays in the start of production of new fields and associated
technical issues linked to the operation of the pipeline; and (iii) a decision to receive royalties due
from CNPC in the form of diesel for electricity generation. In that context, and exacerbated by
uncertainty regarding the timing of placement of bonds in regional markets, the government signed
oil sales‘ advance agreements with a commercial partner (Glencore Energy) for a total of
US$600 million (4.5 percent of GDP) on nonconcessional terms and to be repaid against crude oil
shipments over the next two years4. These oil advances were the primary factor behind increases in
total and external public debt to 30.2 percent and 23.2 percent of GDP, respectively.
7.
The 2014 budget envisages a further reduction in the NOPD, but faces significant
financing needs. The 2014 budget was adopted by the National Assembly in late December and
promulgated by the Head of State in early January. In line with the SMP, the 2014 budget targets an
NOPD of 16.1 percent of non-oil GDP (down from the 18.1 percent of non-oil GDP targeted for
2013) to be achieved through non-oil revenue mobilization (0.4 percent of non-oil GDP) and a
rationalization of domestic investment (1 percent of non-oil GDP) and transfers (0.7 percent of
non-oil GDP). Including the scheduled servicing of the oil advances (of about 2.4 percent of non oil
GDP)—not reflected in the original budget—increases financing needs to about 4.9 percent of nonoil GDP (CFAF 260 billion).
8.
Recently revised balance of payments data show that Chad has been running much
larger external current account deficits. The external current account deficit averaged 8 percent of
GDP between 2009 and 2012 and is projected to have deteriorated further to 8.8 percent of GDP in
2013 on account of the drop in oil exports. These current account deficits have been largely
financed by foreign direct investment, and in some years partially financed by capital transfers. The
overall balance of payments recorded a deficit in 2013, the first time since 2009, bringing the
international reserve coverage ratio to 1.7 months of imports of goods and services (compared to
2.4 months in 2012).
9.
Broad money and bank credit to the economy continue to grow at healthy rates. On
average, broad money increased at an annualized rate of 10 percent over the first nine months of
the year, while credit to the economy recorded a 29 percent annualized growth rate over the same
period. Broad money is projected to grow by 8 percent in 2013 and credit to the economy by about
20 percent. Financial intermediation levels have been improving over time but remain quite low (at
end of September 2013, the ratios of broad money and credit to the economy (comprising mostly
government contractors and government employees) to non-oil GDP were just about 17 percent
and 10 percent, respectively compared to 14 percent and 6 percent at beginning of 2012). Financial
soundness indicators have continued to improve following the recapitalization of state-owned banks

4

The balance of the oil sales advance at the end of 2013 was about US$470 million. The oil revenue shortfall was
about US$240 million and the financing shortfall from delays in domestic borrowing was about US$180 million.

in 2011: the capital to risk-weighted assets ratio increased from 6.7 percent in 2010 to 18.1 percent
in 2012; while nonperforming loans dropped, liquidity increased, and profitability indicators
improved (particularly for the larger banks) slightly (Table 7).

Box 1. Chad: The Implementation of the 2012 Article IV Recommendations
Fiscal policy and sustainability: Staff called for a gradual tightening of the NOPD over the mediumterm allowing the build-up of precautionary buffers in the face of volatile and uncertain oil revenue.
Staff also encouraged seeking to resolve the incompatibility between the MFA and debt sustainability
objectives. The 2012 fiscal outcome, the 2013 revised budget, and the 2014 budget (as reflected in the
design of the SMP) are in line with a steady reduction of the NOPD. The authorities decided to cancel the
US$2 billion non concessional MFA with Eximbank China. However, US$600 million in oil sales‘ advances
were contracted on commercial terms in 2013, keeping debt distress risks high.
Public financial management (PFM): Staff emphasized the need to uphold the central role of the
budget and avoid budget overruns, including by restricting the use of emergency spending
procedures (DAO), introducing a treasury cash flow plan, observing the public procurement code, and
strengthening institutional capacity. These issues were incorporated in the design of the SMP. The PFM
reform agenda, which has incorporated some specific recommendations from a recent technical assistance
mission from the Fund‘s Fiscal Affairs Department, has advanced. While the use of DAOs has shown some
ups and downs, the authorities are introducing measures to both limit DAOs and systematically regularize
them within the budget process. The establishment of monthly cash management plans is underway but
delayed partly due to difficulties in integrating procurement plans. A sizable share of contracts continues to
be awarded without competitive bidding.
Business climate: Staff advised the authorities to work closely with the business community to further
the agenda outlined in the White Book of the National Council of Employers of Chad (CNPT). In terms
of public enterprises, it was recommended to reduce government transfers and to increase their freedom in
price-setting. Limited progress has been made in implementing the White Book apart from more regular
meetings between tax authorities and the private sector to discuss issues of common interest. On pricing, it
is worth noting the liberalization of cement prices and the setting of fuel prices at cost recovery levels.
Strengthening financial sector stability and development: Greater credit exposure to private
companies should be encouraged, while banks should continue to hold capital buffers in excess of
the required minimum 8 percent. Strengthening of the centralized credit registry would help contain
credit risk and the implementation of the anti-money laundering framework would help strengthen
governance. No significant progress has been made in these areas, but financial system indicators have
improved.

11.
The main sources of risk to the outlook stem from the volatility of fiscal oil revenue
and the difficult regional security situation (see Risk Assessment Matrix, Table 9). The high
dependence of the economy on oil —accounting for more than 70 percent of fiscal revenues,
90 percent of total exports of goods, and 30 percent of nominal GDP—makes the outlook highly
vulnerable to negative oil price and production shocks that would force downward adjustments to
public investment plans and reduce the availability of foreign exchange. In addition, regional
security instability could require continued elevated levels of security spending as well as damaging
investor confidence, leading to reduced public and private investments and constraining the
government‘s ability to address other pressing social needs.

Chad faces external stability challenges. Foreign exchange flows hinge critically on oil
exports, while FDI flows have been closely linked to oil sector activities and donor support has been
relatively stable but low, in part reflecting concerns about PFM. External debt sustainability
prospects improved following the decision to cancel the MFA with Eximbank China, but has been
negatively affected by the contracting of oil sales‘ advances. Reserve coverage remains low,
representing about 1.7 months of imports of goods and services at the end of 2013. An analysis of
external competitiveness suggests some over-valuation (Box 2). Standard empirical metrics suggest
that Chad‘s non-oil real effective exchange rate (REER) could be over-valued, by about 1522 percent, higher than the REER over-valuation estimated for the CEMAC as a whole (SM/13/322).
Given Chad‘s membership in a currency union, achievement of external sustainability would require
a sustained fiscal adjustment and structural competitiveness reforms. The latter are critical given
Chad‘s weak performance in standard indicators of the business climate.
Box 2. Chad: Exchange Rate and External Competitiveness Assessment
Two empirical approaches have been used to assess Chad‘s external competitiveness: (i) the Bems/Carvalho

Both approaches suggest significant real exchange rate overvaluations (text table). The Bems/Carvalho
constant real annuity approach places
Chad‘s REER at 22 percent deviation
from equilibrium, i.e., clearly above the
REER deviation in the CEMAC area as a
whole (9-13 percent overvaluation,
SM/13/322). The external sustainability
approach suggests a somewhat lower
overvaluation of 15 percent. Both
estimated norms disregard the impact
of investment expenditure on growth, which accentuates estimated overvaluation if the medium-term
current account is heavily influenced by public investment (as is the case in Chad) provided that expenditure
is productive.
Broader indicators also suggest competitiveness constraints. While non-oil exports have grown robustly,
they remain dominated by a narrow range of products (i.e., cotton, livestock). The overall business
environment lags most countries in the world and its regional peers in all dimensions (text figure).

Discussions under the 2013 Article IV consultation thus focused on how to address
Chad’s substantial development needs in the presence of resource and capacity constraints
and external risks. Chad needs to address capacity bottlenecks, implement fiscal and structural
reforms to create space for social priority spending, and enhance public service delivery, while
dealing with external imbalances and risks. This will first require prudent oil revenue and debt
management. The projected steady reduction in fiscal oil revenue over the medium- and long-terms
will have to be offset by significant improvements in non-oil revenue mobilization and in the quality
of public financial management. It will also require economic diversification, and more inclusive
growth.

IMPLEMENTING DEVELOPMENT PLANS WHILE
ENSURING FISCAL AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
A. The Long-Term Development Challenge
14.
Chad’s ability to tackle its developmental needs and poverty reduction objectives is
seriously hampered by the projected oil revenue trajectory (¶11). There are two additional key
issues: non-oil revenues are low, even relative to other oil exporters in the region; and, Chad‘s public
investment process is quite weak even when compared to other LICs. These two constraints imply
that the ambitious public investment plans envisaged in the NDP may not yield significantly better
growth outcomes, while posing threats to debt sustainability, and leaving Chad very vulnerable to
negative oil revenue shocks. Box 3 and Appendix I look in more detail into the impact of scaled-up
investments on growth, pointing to the need to improve Chad‘s revenue-generation capability
(Section C below) and investment effectiveness (Section D) to create greater fiscal space and
economic upside.
15.
Staff’s baseline scenario, predicated on diminishing oil revenue and a gradual
improvement in absorptive capacity, foresees the need for gradual fiscal adjustment. A fall in
the NOPD to 12 percent of non-oil GDP by 2018 and to 6 percent by 2023 should be consistent with
achieving debt sustainability (Section B). It would also allow an accumulation of some fiscal
buffers—about 3 percent of non-oil GDP by 2018—to hedge against volatile oil revenue over the
medium- and long terms and ensure steady spending (an important issue for effectively tackling
poverty). Against this backdrop, an eventual achievement of debt relief under the HIPC initiative
would provide additional fiscal space toward higher social spending and poverty reduction
objectives.
16.
At the same time, the authorities must address the 2014 financing gap (¶7). Staff
recommended identification of domestic and external concessional financing sources, but additional
adjustment—including non-oil revenue measures and a reduced expenditure envelope (particularly
on domestic public investment and transfers and subsidies)—may be needed in the event that
resources cannot be identified. Any changes would need to be formalized through a revised 2014

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

budget. It would be important to protect social spending from any cuts (domestically-financed
social spending in the budget represents 7.6 percent of non-oil GDP).
Authorities’ views
17.
The authorities consider staff’s oil revenue projections to be overly conservative. They
expect more steady oil production levels thanks to existing oil exploration activities in new fields and
the potential opening of new exploration rounds after a soon to be conducted geological mapping
exercise. In this context, they viewed the recommended fiscal adjustment over the medium and long
terms to be too aggressive and felt that they would have additional space for public investment.

Box 3. Chad: Resource Constraints and Long-Term Public Investment Plans
The projected decline of fiscal oil revenues poses challenges in terms of designing sustainable public
investment plans that can be properly financed and maximize non-oil growth. To analyze these issues in a
holistic way, the DIGNAR (Debt, Investment, Growth
and Natural Resources) model developed by the
Fund‘s Research Department was applied. That
model explicitly takes into account the impact of
scaled-up investment on economic growth—
including the indirect impact derived from their
financing sources (e.g., the contractionary effects of
domestic taxation)—and existing capacity
constraints as represented by a relatively low public
investment efficiency parameter. Simulations were made around two potential public investment paths:
gradual and ―aggressive‖ (or frontloading). Three alternative policy (or financing) scenarios were considered
depending on the ability to replace oil revenue with non-oil domestic taxation (in the form of consumption
and labor taxes): (i) an unconstrained tax scenario, (ii) a strongly constrained scenario and (iii) a mildly
constrained tax scenario. External debt was assumed to be the residual source of financing.
The model and its simulations yielded the following main results:


Increasing non-oil revenues is critical to ensuring public debt sustainability.


While a strategy of frontloading investment leads to a faster buildup of capital, absorptive capacity
constraints dampen the efficiency of investment. The gradual approach leads to a slower but more efficient
creation of capital with reduced threats to debt sustainability.
The model also implies that improvements in public investment efficiency (as measured by the Public
Investment Management Index (PIMI)) through PFM reforms and an improved procurement process would
increase the growth return of public investment projects and reduce debt burdens.

B. Debt Sustainability and Debt Management
18.
The baseline scenario implies that Chad continues to face a high risk of debt distress.
Depending on the assumptions regarding the closing of the 2014 budget financing gap, total public
debt levels would initially fall to 23-26 percent of GDP by 2018, before rising again and stabilizing at
around 33 percent of GDP by the 2030s as the gradual scaling-back of non-priority government

12

CHAD

social spending and the steady increase in non-oil revenue collections would only partially offset
rapidly declining oil revenue. With the exception of the Present Value (PV) of debt-to-exports ratios,
other external debt indicators would remain below the DSA prudential thresholds for the projection
period. The risk of debt distress would remain high on account of a breach to the DSA prudential
threshold (debt to exports) under the baseline scenario. In addition, Chad‘s external debt burden
indicators are highly sensitive to a negative shock to exports (e.g., a two-standard-deviation lower
oil price over 2014-15), reflecting the lack of export diversification. However, development of new
sources of growth over the long term and achievement of debt relief under the HIPC initiative (see
Table 10 for a status report on key reforms and objectives to be achieved before the HIPC
completion point) would help improve debt dynamics and reduce associated vulnerabilities.
19.
The fragmentation of responsibilities in the approval and signature of debt operations
and institutional weaknesses create risks for debt sustainability and fiscal control. The
contracting of oil sales advances in 2013 is an additional example of a significant borrowing
operation that lacked appropriate institutional coordination and that had not been properly
recorded in debt statistics. The lack of a clear mandate in terms of borrowing authority in Chad
contradicts CEMAC regulations on public debt management. In this context, the authorities‘
intention to reactivate and make fully operational the inter-ministerial committee in charge of
approving and monitoring debt operations (National Commission for Debt Analysis, CONAD) as well
as the technical unit (ETAVID) looking at the sustainability of debt is welcome. It remains critical,
however, to centralize debt management operations within the debt unit of the ministry of finance
to strictly control the contracting or guaranteeing of new external debt and to strengthen its human
resources, institutional stability, and debt data recording and reporting capabilities.
Authorities’ views
20.
The authorities are committed to maintaining debt sustainability and enhancing debt
management. They noted that the decision to cancel the MFA with Eximbank China is a signal of
the importance they attach to debt sustainability. At the same time, the authorities stressed that
Chad‘s large development needs require access to external financing sources. In that context, efforts
toward reaching the HIPC completion point are critical to obtain debt relief and to catalyze
increased financing flows from international partners. The authorities acknowledged the
coordination problems that arose from the borrowing operation with Glencore Energy, but noted
the extraordinary circumstances (i.e., the temporary shocks to oil revenue, the urgency of meeting
exceptional security-related spending, and delays in domestic financing) that forced the contracting
of non-concessional borrowing to maintain budgeted spending plans. Regarding debt management,
the authorities are committed to reinforce the capacities of CONAD and ETAVID and are working on
a public debt management law that, among other things, should clarify the responsibilities for debt
analysis, approval, signature, and monitoring. The World Bank will provide technical assistance in
this area.

C. Increasing Fiscal Space
21.
There is a large non-oil tax collection gap in Chad amounting to as much as 16 percent
of non-oil GDP (Box 4 and Appendix II). Staff analysis suggests that, accounting for its economic
and social characteristics, Chad had the potential to raise its non-oil tax revenue to as much as
24 percent of non-oil GDP in 2011, compared to actual collections of 7.6 percent of non-oil GDP.
The analysis finds that the country‘s tax effort is only 32 percent, half the level of other CEMAC
countries. Chad can improve its non-oil tax effort by undertaking reforms in both policy design and
revenue administration, drawing on previous IMF recommendations. Tax policy reforms could focus
on broadening the tax base, minimizing discretionary actions in tax policy design, and simplifying
the tax structure. Similarly, tax administration reforms could include strengthening the operations of
the large taxpayers unit, improving the selection criteria and quality of audits, simplifying and
automating customs procedures, and strengthening human and financial resources at the revenue
authority.

compared to more than

efficiency rates in tax revenue collection in the region, as evidenced by very low C-efficiency and low
ranking on the World Bank‘s ―ease of Paying Taxes‖ and CPIA score on ―Efficiency of Revenue Mobilization.

The current Chadian tax system is estimated to yield 32 percent of its non-oil revenue potential. By

CHAD

Authorities’ views
22.
The authorities agree with staff’s analysis and note that they have undertaken steps
towards improving non-oil revenue over the past two years. Since 2012, they have been taking
steps to reduce tax exemptions, with the ones that are in force now mostly related to concessions
granted before 2012. They are also moving towards harmonizing the country‘s tax code, including
exemptions, with that agreed at the CEMAC level. On tax administration, the authorities are currently
in the process of automating major customs offices—including at the Cameroon border—following
the automation of the N‘Djamena office. More broadly, the Minister of Finance and Budget set up a
team to formulate recommendations, due by early 2014, on how the government can mobilize nonoil revenue. The authorities are also committed to implement the recommendations from Fund
technical assistance on enhancing tax revenue.

D. Strengthen Public Financial Management
23.
PFM systems remain weak and need to be reinforced to enhance fiscal control and the
efficiency of public spending:


Budget execution has been hampered by issues like the extensive use of emergency spending
procedures (DAOs, see Figure 1) and cash flow management difficulties stemming from the
volatility of oil revenue and the irregular seasonality of spending. Moreover, despite some recent
progress, the accounting process is still manual and fiscal reporting is limited (e.g., there is no
formal procedure to frequently report on budget execution). A recent FAD TA mission proposed
that the authorities focus on several shorter-term actions to: (i) improve spending procedures
(including through a phased elimination of the budget‘s complementary period and the
systematic regularization of DAOs); (ii) improve the reliability of accounting through
computerization; (iii) enhance the quality and frequency of budget reporting tools; and
(iv) improve the treasury‘s management and forecasting.



In addition, the effectiveness of spending has been undermined by capacity weaknesses in the
appraisal and selection of investment projects, a limited reliance on competitive bidding for
public contracts (only 46 percent of contracts, accounting for 18 percent of the total value of
contracts in 2012), and low allocation of operational and maintenance resources. As noted
above, fixing these issues could give a significant boost to non-oil growth prospects.

Authorities’ views
24.
The authorities acknowledge weaknesses in their PFM systems and are implementing a
reform action plan drawing on Fund technical assistance recommendations. Regarding DAOs,
efforts are being made both in terms of limiting use to true emergencies and systematically
regularizing them. In order to improve cash management, the ministry of finance is proceeding to
close non-essential government accounts at commercial banks. Payment automation has been
successfully implemented and an accounting IT system is scheduled to be deployed in 2014. In

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

terms of procurement, the government is committed to increase the use of competitive bidding in
the award of public contracts and to restart the publication of procurement bulletins.

A drive toward a more diversified and inclusive economy needs to be supported by a
more favorable business environment, increased government effectiveness, and an
expansion in financial services to the broader population.
25.
Non-oil economic growth over the last decade has been relatively high, but volatile
and not very inclusive (Appendix III). The volatility in non-oil activity can be partly explained by
pro-cyclical fiscal policy driven by oil revenues, the vulnerability of agricultural production to climate
conditions, the armed conflicts that affected the country between 2004 and 2010, and also the
difficulties of the cotton sector. The latest household survey suggests that the poverty headcount
rate experienced a moderate reduction (from 55 percent in 2003 to 47 percent in 2011), but the
total number of poor increased as Chad has one of the highest population growth rates in the world
(3.5 percent per year over 2000-10). Poverty reduction has been faster in urban than in rural areas,
with poverty remaining more than twice as widespread in rural areas.5 In addition, inequality has
slightly increased (the Gini coefficient changed from 0.39 to 0.42). The government has recently
focused on building infrastructure (at relatively high cost according to the 2010 World Bank‘s public
expenditure review) and lacks specific social safety nets to help the more vulnerable (less than
1 percent of the spending envelope under the NDP is devoted to social protection).

5

The 2011 survey results were probably affected by the impact of a drought on agricultural production.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CHAD

26.
The authorities’ economic strategy is based on the NDP 2013 20156. It aims at sustaining
economic growth and improving the quality of life of the population, especially the rural population,
women and the youth. To make growth more sustainable and diversified, the NDP gives priority to
modernization, mechanization, and distribution of inputs to enhance productivity in the agricultural
sector. It continues to rely on ambitious public investment plans in infrastructure, including in key
areas like transport, energy, housing, and connective infrastructure for regional integration. Similarly,
to make growth more inclusive, the NDP aims at creating decent employment opportunities through
organizing the informal sector, mitigating rural-urban migration pressures, and skills development. It
also aims to promote social development and achievement of the MDGs through universal access to
quality basic health services, universal access to basic education, and access to water supply and
sanitation services for the entire population. The NDP includes a Priority Action Plan (PAP) that
identifies a list of actions and related implementation costs for each policy area. The estimated cost
of implementing the PAP (excluding salaries, goods and services) is about US$7.4 billion. The
authorities intend to organize a donor roundtable later in 2014 to help cover the estimated funding
gap of about US$3.5 billion. This could allow them to incorporate new initiatives into their budgets
and to update their macroeconomic framework and DSA. However, an increase in donor support
from the current relatively low levels7 and the growth and poverty reduction implications of those
initiatives will ultimately depend on the success of the authorities‘ work to improve PFM and
expenditure effectiveness.

A. Competitiveness and Business Environment
27.
Limited progress has been achieved in improving Chad’s difficult business climate. The
World Bank‗s ―Doing Business‖ indicators (Box 2) show that Chad trails its peers in almost all
dimensions, particularly in starting a business, enforcing contracts, paying taxes, and trading across
borders8. In addition, bottlenecks exist in terms of infrastructure, labor quality, and access to finance.
Limited progress has occurred over the last year in the implementation of the initiatives proposed
by the National Council of Employers of Chad (the White Book as reported in the 2012 Article IV
Consultation report). However, there has been an enhanced dialogue between the government and
the private sector that is reflected in the objectives of the NDP in terms of removing key bottlenecks
to growth such as inadequate infrastructure and high transaction costs. Public investment in roads
has had a very positive impact in connecting Chad within and outside its borders, but limited and
unreliable electricity provision and long delays in getting cargo through the port of Douala in
Cameroon increase domestic prices and hurt the competitiveness of Chadian companies.

These indicators should be interpreted with caution due to a limited number of respondents, a limited geographical
coverage, and standardized assumptions on business constraints and information availability.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

CHAD

28.
Increased government effectiveness would help improve Chad’s competitiveness in
various dimensions. The World Bank‘s Governance Indicators rank Chad below its peers, including
on application of the rule of law and in government effectiveness. Partly because of institutional
capacity constraints it faces, Chad needs to identify priority areas for improvement. In this context:


Public investment has helped reduce infrastructure gaps, in particular on roads. But it remains a
priority. Going forward, increased focus on basic infrastructure services (e.g. access to safe water
and sanitation) is needed. As noted above, improving budgetary allocation for operations and
maintenance of the public capital stock should enhance its rate of return.



With agriculture and livestock considered to be sectors with strong growth and export potential,
a focus on enhancing service provision to rural communities, and food security would help
revive the agriculture sector and make growth more inclusive.



Reforming the electricity and water state-owned enterprises should enhance overall
competitiveness by increasing and making more reliable their supply and access.

29.
Enhancing the transparency of government operations is also critical. The World Bank‘s
Transparency Index ranks Chad very low in that dimension. Beyond the public procurement reforms
noted above, a key issue is oil revenue transparency. Operations of the Esso Consortium have been
fairly easy to monitor thanks to the mechanisms set up under the Petroleum Revenue Management
Program designed in conjunction with the World Bank in the early 2000s. However, the entry of new
oil producers (e.g., CNPC and Griffiths/Caracal) under diverse fiscal regimes generates challenges for
oil revenue transparency. Despite recent efforts, Chad has not been able to achieve the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) compliance and has been asked to implement corrective
actions and outstanding requirements (8 out of 20) by August 2014.
Authorities’ views
30.
The authorities acknowledge the need to further improve the business environment to
help diversify the economy and promote a more inclusive growth. They noted that the NDP
agenda includes some initiatives proposed by the private sector to improve the business climate.
They intend to implement them in coordination with the private sector. The authorities believe that
the food security initiatives introduced after the 2011 drought represent important inclusive growth
policies and that restarting the publication of public procurement bulletins in 2014, which is also a
trigger under the HIPC completion point process, is a ―quick win‖ to improve governance and public
spending efficiency. They also highlighted the soon-to-be finalized national strategy for social
protection, which aims at formulating more specific programs in the areas of social assistance,
employment, food security, and access to health and education services.

B. Financial Inclusion
31.
Financial exclusion constitutes an important obstacle to growth and development in
Chad. The financial sector in Chad is under-developed and with major challenges to financial access.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CHAD

While some financial intermediation indicators have continued to improve (¶9), they still remain
substantially below those of peer CEMAC countries. Responses to the recommendations of the 2011
FSAP to deal with the lack of adequate information on borrowers and to enhance the resolution of
commercial disputes are still pending. Similarly, an adequate credit reporting system still needs to
be developed. Some indicators show a very low level of financial access: fewer than 22 depositors
per 1000 adults (compared to 128 for SSA), fewer than 3 borrowers per 1000 adults (compared to
21 for SSA), and less than 1 commercial bank branch per 100,000 adults (compared to 3.7 for SSA).
Microfinance institutions—a critical source of financing for SMEs and rural borrowers in most
countries—still account for a very small proportion of the financial system (e.g., less than 3 percent
of total credit to the economy in 2012). There is a need to build both hard and soft infrastructures
(legal and information institutions) to increase the scale and efficiency of microfinance institutions.
Authorities’ views
32.
The authorities note the enhanced stability of the banking system and their efforts to
increase access to financial services. They are satisfied with the steps taken to improve the
condition of state-owned banks after the recent restructuring and consider that the banking system
in general has been doing very well. The authorities acknowledge that the micro-finance sector is
still under-developed, but is an important component of its national financial inclusion strategy.
Several initiatives are under way to deepen financial intermediation, but more efforts will have to be
made to increase access to financial services in remote areas.

THE STAFF-MONITORED PROGRAM
33.
Performance relative to the quantitative targets under the SMP has been mixed: most
targets have been met but fiscal outcomes have been affected by the unexpected shortfall in oil
revenue and the resort to oil sales advances. Four out of the seven indicators were met for June and
five out of the seven indicators were met for September.


The indicator concerning the underlying fiscal policy stance (the NOPD) was met for June and
September with relatively comfortable margins. The performance of non-oil revenue was good,
particularly tax collections by the domestic taxes‘ department. In terms of expenditures, the
government contained overall spending levels within the program limits even though transfers
and subsidies accelerated relative to the first half of the year.



The floor for poverty-reducing social spending was met with a healthy margin and the
government did not accumulate domestic or external payment arrears over the period. The
ceiling on net domestic government financing was missed at end-June but was brought back on
track by September despite delays in the issuance of government bonds in the regional market
and a faster than anticipated settlement of domestic arrears from previous financial years thanks
to the oil sales advance with Glencore Energy (¶6).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

CHAD



34.

The oil sales advance operation implied that the continuous ceilings on contracting or
guaranteeing new non-concessional external debt and on new guaranteed (i.e., collateralized)
external debt contracted or guaranteed by the government and/or non-financial public
enterprises were not observed for end-June and end-December test dates.9 The operation also
revealed deficiencies in coordination of debt management within the government leading to its
delayed reporting for budget formulation and SMP monitoring purposes.
Most structural benchmarks are expected to be completed, although some with delay.



The draft 2014 budget submitted to the National Assembly in October last year (and
subsequently approved in early January 2014) was in line with the objective of gradually
reducing the NOPD and the discussions with staff in early September.



The reconciliation of treasury and central bank data on net claims of the banking system on the
government at end-2012 is likely to be met by end-2013 instead of September 2013. The
accounts at commercial banks that led to differences in the level of central government deposits
between the treasury and BEAC have been identified and should facilitate the establishment of a
single treasury account. Additional work is needed to reconcile the differences in central
government liabilities to commercial banks.



The evolution of emergency spending pressures (DAOs) until end-October was in line with the
SMP objective of keeping them below 20 percent of domestically financed spending (excluding
wages, debt service, and security spending linked to the campaign in Mali). Regulations have
been issued to limit their use and a monitoring committee has been established and is meeting
regularly. In addition, the authorities have recently established a commission to ensure a swift
regularization of DAOs. The latter initiative stem from a recommendation of FAD technical
assistance.



The preparation and updating of a monthly treasury cash management plan (with a three-month
rolling horizon) is unlikely to be achieved in 2013. This is a complex reform requiring some
institutional enhancements and improvements in forecasting of oil revenue and in taking into
account seasonality of non-oil revenue and government spending. In particular, the authorities
noted the difficulties in integrating cash planning with public procurement plans.



The requirement to have all new loan proposals to be examined by ETAVID and CONAD is
unlikely to be met. The capacity of CONAD and ETAVID to provide binding opinions on all new
loan proposals was expected to be supported by a new government decree reinforcing their
roles and structure. The importance of this action has increased following the contracting of oil
sales advances.

9

Information on the non-observance of these two quantitative targets was brought to staff‘s attention during the
mission in December, 2013.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CHAD

35.
The final assessment of performance under the SMP will take place in the first quarter
of 2014. The authorities expect to meet the NOPD target for 2013 despite spending pressures
derived from a difficult regional security situation and from high spending execution rates in
transfers and subsidies. They highlighted that some momentum was being achieved in the
implementation of PFM reforms following FAD‘s technical assistance mission, particularly in the
monitoring of DAOs and in the implementation of automated systems for payments and
accounting. Finally, the authorities noted the maintenance of high rates of non-oil growth and the
reduction of inflation under the SMP.

STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
The achievement of Chad’s development goals hinges on a prudent management of
volatile and exhaustible oil revenue and on making economic growth more inclusive. Chad
ranked 184th out of 186 countries in the UN‘s 2013 Human Development Index despite substantial
oil fiscal revenues for the past decade. Non-oil economic growth has been relatively high but
volatile over the last decade due in part to pro-cyclical fiscal policy relative to oil revenue, the
vulnerability of agricultural production to climate conditions, and past civil conflicts. There has been
a moderate reduction in poverty rates over that period, though the total number of poor has
increased due to high rates of population growth. Poverty has fallen faster in urban than in rural
areas and income inequality has slightly increased.
37.
Macroeconomic performance has been relatively strong despite regional security
challenges. Non-oil growth has been solid and inflation relatively muted, trends projected to
continue in 2014. The authorities have been able to gradually tighten the stance of fiscal policy
despite spending pressures linked to the difficult regional security situation. However, the fiscal
position remains highly vulnerable to oil revenue shocks.
38.
Sharp increases in non-oil revenue and more efficient government spending are
critical to Chad’s ability to tackle its developmental needs while maintaining debt
sustainability. Chad should continue the recent policy of targeting a steady decline in the non oil
primary deficit (toward 12-13 percent of non-oil GDP over the medium-term) in light of the
projected trend decline in oil revenue and the need to build some fiscal buffers to face the country‘s
vulnerability to volatile oil prices and the difficult regional security situation. Substantial fiscal space
can be created by increasing non-oil revenue collection currently very low even relative to peer
countries in the region—and by improving the quality of government spending. Sizable increases in
non-oil revenue collection can be achieved through enhancements in both tax policy design (e.g., by
streamlining exemptions) and revenue and customs administrations in line with FAD technical
assistance. The quality of government spending can be enhanced by rationalizing investment plans,
increasing allocations for operations and maintenance, and greater reliance on competitive bidding
in the award of public contracts.
39.
Debt management needs to be strengthened to help ensure debt sustainability. Staff
takes note of the decision to cancel the Master Facility Agreement with Eximbank China as an

important step toward ensuring debt sustainability. A recent non-concessional borrowing operation
that collateralized future oil receipts maintains the high risk of debt distress and reinforces the case
for institutional reforms to centralize debt approval and operational management and to strengthen
the debt unit at the ministry of finance. The authorities are encouraged to effectively implement
recent policy decisions in this area, including the reactivation of an inter-ministerial committee for
debt analysis.
40.
PFM reforms are crucial to ensure fiscal discipline and to improve the quality of
spending. PFM systems remain weak. Execution of the budget has in the past been hampered by
extensive use of emergency spending procedures (DAOs) and cash flow management difficulties,
while accounting is still manual and fiscal reporting is limited. The recent acceleration in
implementation of the PFM reform agenda is welcome, though critical steps remain. Of particular
importance are the phasing out of the budget‘s complementary period, the streamlining of DAOs,
and the computerization of the whole expenditure chain. Sustained progress in these areas should
help catalyze an increase in donor support.
41.
Greater diversification of the economy would enable more inclusive growth. Staff
analysis based on standard empirical metrics suggests that Chad has an over-valued real exchange
rate (Box 2). Given Chad‘s membership in a currency union, achievement of external sustainability
would require a sustained fiscal adjustment and structural competitiveness reforms. A key step to
enhance productive potential is to create a more conducive business environment for the private
sector. To that effect, specific proposals in the ―White Book‖ prepared by private employers still
provide useful benchmarks for policy action. While substantial progress has been made in roads
infrastructure, electricity provision remains a key bottleneck requiring sustained efforts over the
longer term. Increased government effectiveness in terms of the quality and composition of public
spending and targeted support to agricultural and rural sectors would help make growth more
inclusive. Diversification and inclusiveness will also require further financial development and
increased access to financial services, including by putting in place legal and information institutions
to increase the scale and efficiency of microfinance institutions.
42.
Performance under the SMP has been affected by an unexpected shortfall in oil
revenue and the resort to oil sales advances. Five out of the seven indicators were met for
September (four out of seven had been met for June). Indicators concerning the underlying fiscal
policy stance (the NOPD), the level of poverty spending, and the pace of arrears clearance have all
been observed with comfortable margins for June and September. However, the oil sales advance
operation resulted in breaches for the debt targets and has led to a significant increase in financing
needs in the approved 2014 budget. Those financing needs surpass potentially available domestic
and nonconcessional financing sources, leading to a sizable financing gap. The authorities are
strongly encouraged to identify corrective actions to cover this gap, in particular through additional
fiscal adjustment (i.e., cuts in domestically-financed investment and in transfers and subsidies,
increases in non-oil revenue) and an acceleration of the structural reform agenda—including on
debt management (¶39). Most structural benchmarks are expected to be met.

Data provision has capacity-related shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for
surveillance. There is scope for improvement in quality, coverage, and timeliness in most
macroeconomic datasets. The authorities have recently taken the initiative to improve
macroeconomic databases, particularly the national accounts. Data on the international investment
position (IIP) is not reported, reflecting a lack of capacity. The authorities are encouraged to request
technical assistance to overcome this limitation.
44.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Chad be held on the
regular 12-month consultation cycle.

Impact and Policy Response
Impact: High. A sustained decline in oil prices would result in a
shortfall in fiscal oil revenues and worsen the current account deficit.
The fiscal shortfall could also delay several public investment
projects, notably in agriculture and infrastructure.
Policy responses: Smooth public expenditure over the medium-term
and build sufficient fiscal buffers; strengthen non-oil revenue
mobilization.
Impact: High. It could cause: (1) displacement of population and
increased need for humanitarian assistance; (2) increased securityrelated government expenditures that could crowd out other priority
spending such as social or investment.
Policy response: Rebuild fiscal buffers; budget sufficient resources for
emergency security-related spending
Impact: Medium. It could affect Chad‘s most vulnerable population
through a combination of high food prices, and increased
malnutrition; could lead to social and political tensions in an already
fragile environment; and could jeopardize government‘s fiscal
position as authorities respond to the crisis.
Policy response: Continue coordination with development partners to
strengthen Chad‘s resilience to weather shocks; promote policies for
economic diversification and higher labor productivity, particularly in
agriculture; strengthen social safety net programs, targeted at
protecting the poor and vulnerable segments of the society.
Impact: High. A higher than anticipated non-oil primary deficit
(NOPD) would lead to a build up of arrears and increased borrowing
from the securities market, with adverse implications on the SMP,
prospective donor support for the PRSP implementation, and HIPC
completion point prospects.
Policy response: Continue close monitoring of budget execution,
including implementation of commitments under the SMP; limit the
use of DAOs

Appendix I. Public Investment, Natural Resources and Debt
Sustainability1
1.

The Chadian economy is heavily exposed to volatile and exhaustible oil resources. The

oil sector currently contributes 70 percent of fiscal revenues, 90 percent of total exports, and
30 percent of nominal GDP. However, according to current projections and absent new discoveries,
fiscal oil revenues are expected to decline steadily and be relatively insignificant by early 2030s.
Therefore, while high oil revenues have allowed the government to substantially increase public
investment in recent years, there is a question as to how this trend can be maintained over the
medium- and long-terms.
2.

The DIGNAR (Debt, Investment, Growth and Natural Resources) model provides a framework

to analyze the feasibility of ambitious public investment plans in Chad. The model is designed to
analyze the nexus between natural resources revenue management, public investment and public
debt. Its analytical framework is based on Buffie et al. (2012), Berg et al. (2013) and Melina et al.
(2013), including a natural resource sector, investment efficiency, limited absorptive capacity, Dutch
disease, and a detailed fiscal specification reflecting the operation of fiscal buffers. Taking resource
revenues and public investment policy as given, the framework can simulate the macroeconomic
outcomes of investing resource revenue, accounting for the investment-growth linkage and the
feedback effect on non-resource revenue.
3.

The DIGNAR model provides a stylized representation of an economy calibrated to Chad

specifics.


It features two types of households. Optimizing households have access to financial markets and
can acquire domestic government bond and international bonds with portfolio adjustment
costs, which restricts the degree of capital account openness. The private sector pays a premium
on foreign debt over the interest rate that the government pays on its own external debt.
Non-optimizing consumers or rule-of-thumb consumers are liquidity constrained and consume
all of their disposable income in each period.



The model has three production sectors. Traded and non-traded goods are produced according
to a Cobb-Douglas production function with three inputs: labor, private capital and public
capital. The difference between these two sectors resides in the modeling of technological

1

38

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CHAD

progress—assumed to be exogenous in the non-traded sector is exogenous whereas in the
traded sector is subject to learning-by-doing externalities and depends positively on the
previous period output. The intuition is that once traded sector production starts falling,
knowledge and skills can be lost. The third sector produces oil and is assumed to be
exogenously given with both price and quantities taken as given.


The capital formation process is subject to absorptive capacity constraints and government
inefficiency. In particular, effective government investment is just a fraction of government
expenditure on investment. Furthermore, to capture the idea of rising investment costs due to
absorptive capacity constraints, we assume that investment efficiency falls when the expenditure
level exceeds a certain threshold. Moreover, to capture the effects of a lack of maintenance of
public capital, we assume a time varying depreciation rate.



The government finances its consumption and investment expenditure with taxes and debt. In
particular, taxes are collected from the oil and non-oil sectors. Foreign debt is subject to a risk
premium that depends on the stock of external debt. In every period, the government can
choose to close the fiscal gap with an increase in taxes, in debt, or both. Furthermore, the model
features a fiscal buffer to edge against oil revenue volatility.

4.

Three alternative policy scenarios are considered in the simulations for Chad:

a.

Unconstrained taxes. In this scenario, the burden of closing the fiscal gap is solely on taxes.

b.
Strongly constrained taxes. In this scenario, ceilings on labor tax of 25 percent and on
consumption tax of 18 percent are included. This scenario more or less reflects Chad‘s current tax
system‘s profile, with a statutory payroll tax rate of 7.5 percent on gross salaries and a VAT rate of
18 percent.
c.
Mildly constrained taxes. Ceilings on labor tax of 25 percent and on consumption tax of
21 percent are included.
5.

Two alternative approaches to public investment scaling up are explored:

a.
A gradual approach. Public investment expenditure to GDP is constant throughout the
simulation horizon, at 8 percent of non-resource GDP from 2013 to 2030.
b.
An aggressive approach. A frontloading investment path is considered and it is assumed that
public investment spending as a share of non-resource GDP jumps to 13.3 percent and remains
above 11 percent prior to 2017.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

39

CHAD

6.

The initial steady state of the economy is mostly calibrated to the 2011 data of Chad.

The calibration implies a public capital to GDP ratio of 0.35.2
7.

Frontloading investment leads to a faster buildup of public capital. Absorptive capacity

constraints, however, lower the investment efficiency from 0.5 (the initial steady- state level) to
below 0.4 initially. Without sufficient investment in later periods to cover recurrent costs, public
capital depreciates over time. With non-frontloading, public capital rises more slowly. A relatively
stable investment pace yields sustainable public capital (i.e., it does not fall in later years). Also, nonfrontloading is more in line with absorptive capacity, and investment efficiency does not drop much
below 0.5.
8.

The level of government debt varies considerably in the three fiscal policy scenarios. In

the unconstrained taxes case, where the fiscal gap is closed by taxes, the ratio of debt to GDP
increases modestly and stabilizes just above 50 percent by 2035. In the strong constraint case, the
ceilings on labor and consumption taxes raise significant concern on debt sustainability under both
paths since the ratio of debt to GDP goes beyond 100 percent by 2035. In the last case, a mild
constraint on taxes prevents the ratio of debt to GDP to explode.
9.

Under either investment path, the economy cannot accumulate much fiscal buffers. As

the simulations show, fiscal buffers rise briefly to almost 6 percent of non-resource GDP. However,
as resource revenues declines, the resource fund is drawn down and drops to a minimal level and it
goes eventually to zero.
10.

Relative to non-frontloading, frontloading of investment generates more appreciation

in the real exchange rate and hence more negative response in traded output during the first
few years. In later years, substantial weaker domestic demand due to higher taxes depreciates the
real exchange rate and much positive traded output responses.
11.

In sum, a gradual public investment scaling-up would seem more appropriate given

financing constraints and risks. Frontloading investment leads to a faster buildup of capital but
poses threats to debt sustainability.

2

To have a relatively low public capital to GDP ratio initially, we set the ratio of public investment to non-resource
GDP to be 0.7, much below capital spending level in 2011.

Appendix II. Chad’s Non-Oil Revenue Performance and Potential1
BACKGROUND
1.

Strengthening Chad’s non-oil revenue is critical to addressing the country’s long-term

development needs in a sustainable manner. Since 2003, Chad has been largely relying on fiscal
oil revenue to finance its public expenditure. However, oil revenue has proved to be volatile—which
has translated into volatility in public spending—and is exhaustible in the foreseeable future. Absent
new discoveries, oil revenue is expected to decline significantly from a record-high of 25 percent of
non-oil GDP in 2011 to less than 5 percent by 2030. On the other hand, achieving Chad‘s
development objectives is partly anchored on an aggressive public investment program. A welldiversified non-oil tax base would therefore provide Chad with the needed revenue stream to
support critical public programs as oil resources are depleted.
CHAD’S NON-OIL REVENUE PERFORMANCE
2.

Chad’s non-oil revenue collection is low, even when compared to other oil exporters in

the region. Between 2004 and 2011, non-oil revenue for Chad has consistently been lower than that
of its peers, averaging less than 8 percent of non-oil GDP over the period, compared to more than
13 percent in the other oil-producing countries in the CEMAC region (Figure 1). Low collections are
to be expected given e the low per capita income, the importance of subsistence agriculture and the
informal sectors, and tax policy and administration weaknesses.

Chad also ranks low among its regional peers in other revenue mobilization indicators.

Under the World Bank‘s CPIA indicator on ―Efficiency of Revenue Mobilization‖ in 2013, the country‘s
score of 2.5 is the lowest among CEMAC countries for which data are available, including Cameroon
(3.5), Central African Republic (3.0), and the Republic of Congo (3.0)2. It also ranks lower than most
other comparator regions, like Sub-Saharan Africa (3.4), or resource-rich countries (3.3). Similarly,
Chad has been ranked last in the two recent rankings on the World Bank‘s ―ease of paying taxes‖3
(table 1).
Table 1: Paying Taxes in Chad and the CEMAC Region, 2013

4.

With respect to tax buoyancy, growth in Chad’s non-oil tax revenue seems to have

kept pace with growth in non-oil GDP. Between 2004 and 2011, the estimated elasticity for Chad
is 1.2, indicating that non-oil tax revenues have been growing at a faster rate than non-oil GDP. This
rate compares favorably against Equatorial Guinea (0.3) and Gabon (1.1), but is lower than
Cameroon (1.6), Central African Republic (1.8) and Republic of Congo (1.8).
5.

The low non-oil revenue performance relative to regional peers can be traced to

differences in tax policy choices and a weak revenue administration. The country‘s tax rates are
largely comparable with its regional peers. For example, Chad‘s non-oil Corporate Income Tax (CIT)
rate of 40 percent is the highest in the region, while its Value Added Tax (VAT) rate is comparable
with most countries in CEMAC. However, the country‘s estimated C-efficiency (defined as the

and tax administration indicators, in a ranking that ranges from 1 (low) to 6 (high).

of the administrative burden in paying taxes. These measures include the number of payments an entrepreneur must

is the lowest in the region by a substantial margin4. The C-efficiency for Chad in 2011 was 5 percent,
which is significantly lower than Cameroon (33 percent) and Equatorial Guinea (42 percent, the
region‘s highest). Moreover, the C-efficiency has remained stagnant at around 5 percent between
2007 and 2011, reflecting continued weaknesses in both policy design and tax administration.

ESTIMATING CHAD’S NON-OIL REVENUE POTENTIAL5
6.

This section employs a stochastic tax frontier model to estimate Chad’s non-oil tax

capacity and effort. A study of tax capacity aims to determine the maximum level of revenue a
country can collect, given its economic, social, institutional and demographic characteristics. To that
end, a stochastic frontier analysis is employed to estimate the maximum level of revenue that is
possible (i.e. the frontier), for given characteristics of a country. The model explains revenue
performance of countries by indicators such as per capita income, the income distribution, the level
of education, the sector composition of the economy, and institutional factors such as the degree of
corruption and indicators of governance (see Box 1 for technical details of the model).

4

Due to unavailability of data on VAT revenues for all the CEMAC countries, we estimated VAT C-Efficiency for three
countries only: Chad, Cameroon, and Equatorial Guinea. However, C-Efficiency estimates for all countries based on
taxes on goods and services (of which VAT revenue is the largest contributor) reveal the same pattern, i.e., that Chad
has the lowest efficiency in the region.

7.

The ratio of actual revenue and tax capacity, provides an estimate for tax effort. The lower

the tax effort, the further is a country away from the maximum level of revenue it can collect
according to international experiences.

Box 1. Stochastic Frontier Models1
The stochastic frontier model of Aigner, Lovell, and Schmidt (1977) is the standard econometric platform for
the analysis carried out in this paper. A panel version of this model can be written as

y it =  +  ' x it + vit  uit

1

Where,
yit represents the log tax revenue to GDP ratio for country i at time t;
xit is the vector that represents variables affecting tax revenue for country i at time t;
is a vector of unknown parameters,
uit, represents the inefficiency, the ―failure‖ to produce the relative maximum level of tax collection or
production. It is a non-negative random variable associated with country-specific factors which contribute
to country i not attaining its tax capacity at time t.
vit is the statistical noise (the disturbance or error term). It is a random (stochastic) variable which represents
the independent variables that explain the dependent one but are not explicitly taken into account as well
as measurement errors and incorrect functional form; vit can be positive or negative and so the stochastic
frontier outputs vary on the deterministic part of the model.
As is usual, it is assumed that:
vit has a normal distribution,
v and u are statistically independent of each other.
i

i

uit, > 0, but vit may take any value.
The analysis aims to predict and measure inefficiency effects. To do so, we use the tax effort, defined as the
ratio between actual tax revenue and the corresponding stochastic frontier tax revenue (tax capacity). This
measure of tax effort has a value between zero and one.

The estimation results reveal that Chad has the highest potential to improve its non-oil tax

revenue collection in the region (table 2). Chad has the lowest non-oil tax effort in the CEMAC
region. Given its economic and social characteristics, Chad‘s potential to collect non-oil revenue is
estimated at 24 percent of non-oil GDP in 2011, but only managed to raise 7.6 percent, reflecting a
tax effort of 32 percent. Accordingly, in 2011 alone, Chad‘s actual non-oil tax-to-non-oil GDP ratio
was below its potential by over 15 percent of non-oil GDP, suggesting significant room for

broadening the tax base and strengthening tax administration. Thus, if Chad were to raise its tax
effort to the CEMAC regional average of 0.67 -excluding Chad-, its non-oil revenue would increase
by 8.5 percent of GDP.
Table 2: Non-oil Tax Effort in the CEMAC Region, 2011

CONCLUSION AND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
9.

Chad has substantial scope to increase its non-oil revenue to finance its long-term

development objectives. An analysis of several indicators has clearly shown that the country lags
behind its regional peers in terms of revenue collection. Econometric evidence suggests that Chad‘s
non-oil tax effort of 32 percent is the lowest among the CEMAC oil-producing countries. The
country also has the lowest efficiency rates in tax revenue collection in the region, as evidenced by
very low C-efficiency, low ranking on the World Bank‘s ―ease of Paying Taxes‖ and CPIA score on
―Efficiency of Revenue Mobilization.‖
10.

Improving non-oil revenue collection will require enhancements in both tax policy

measures and revenue administration, in line with previous IMF recommendations. Tax policy
reforms could focus on broadening the tax base, including by reviewing tax incentives and
exemptions, minimizing discretionary actions in tax policy design; and simplifying the tax structure
to eliminate taxes with small collections that are enormously costly to comply with and administer.
Specific areas of the policy reforms, along with their sequencing, could be couched around
recommendations of the 2010 FAD TA on tax policy review, including:


Curbing numerous VAT tax preferences, which deteriorate the VAT tax base, seriously undermine
VAT revenue productivity, and lead to tax evasion and leakage (short- to medium-term);

48

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CHAD



Harmonizing tax exemptions with those in the CEMAC region (short-term);



Increasing taxes on tobacco and other luxury goods (to 25 percent);



Liaising with other line ministries with the aim of minimizing earmarked taxes (short-term);



Reducing corporate income tax rate from 40 percent to 35 percent and the minimum flat tax
rate from 1.5 percent to 1 percent (long-term).6

11.

On strengthening tax and customs administration, the authorities should take

concrete steps towards implementing the recent FAD recommendations. Potential reforms
include: strengthening the operations of the large taxpayers unit; improving the selection criteria
and quality of audits; simplifying and automating customs procedures; and ensuring that both the
tax and customs administrations have the human and financial resources to carry out their functions.

6

A recent study by the African Development Bank (AfDB) also provides broadly similar policy recommendations for
enhancing non-oil domestic resource mobilization in Chad.

Appendix III. Inclusive Growth in Chad1
OVERVIEW
1.
Chad remains one of the poorest countries in the world despite a fast and volatile
economic growth since the start of oil production in 2002/03. The strong economic growth
has not been very inclusive, as evidenced by a moderate but uneven poverty reduction, an
increase in inequality, and an unbalanced growth mainly driven by the oil and oil-related sectors.
The key bottlenecks to inclusive growth are volatile and unproductive public spending, business
environment and structural competitiveness, financial exclusion, poor coverage of basic
infrastructure, lack of decent jobs and social protection.
2.
Chad achieved some moderate poverty reduction as economic growth picked up
speed after the oil discovery2. The poverty headcount rate (percentage of Chadians living
below the national poverty line) dropped from 54.8 percent in 2003 to 46.7 percent in 2011. The
elasticity of poverty reduction to per capita income growth in Chad lagged behind some regional
peer countries (Figure 1). Despite the

widespread in rural areas than in urban
areas, and the poverty gap was more than three times larger in rural areas. The lowest poverty
headcount rate was recorded in N‘Djamena (11 percent) on account of government-related
activities (e.g. construction, services), while the highest poverty headcount rates were recorded in
the largely agricultural regions (Moyen-Chari/Mandoul, Logone Occidental, and Tandjile) as a
result of an overall decline in cash-crop production, in particular cotton.
4.
Inequality has increased in Chad. The Gini coefficient rose from 39.4 percent in 2003 to
42.1 percent in 2011. Rural inequality is greater than urban inequality, and this disparity has
increased over time. Consumption disparities between the richest and poorest also widened over
time, as consumption expenditures have grown fast for the top four quintiles while barely seen
any growth for the bottom quintile. In 2011 the richest quintile accounting for 48 percent of total

Sector Surveys (ECOSIT2 and ECOSIT3).

consumption expenditures while the poorest quintile only accounted for 5 percent of total
consumption expenditures.
5.
The Chadian economy is oil dominated and its fast economic growth over the past
decade has largely come from its oil GDP growth. In 2012, the oil sector accounted for almost
30 percent of Chad‘s GDP, more than 70 percent of its fiscal revenues, and almost 90 percent of
its exports3. Chad‘s non-oil GDP growth has been slower and quite volatile; in particular, the
primary sector‘s growth largely stagnated over the last decade and started recovering only
recently (Figure 2).

KEY BOTTLENECKS
6.
Highly volatile and inefficient public spending has greatly limited the positive
impact of public spending on development indicators. Chad has not managed the oil revenue
volatility well which often transmitted to stop-and-go public spending on infrastructure projects,
leading to unit costs of construction far above the regional average4. In addition, public
resources have not been pro-poor in Chad (for example, the poorest quintile received 6 percent
of total public health expenditure while the richest quintile captured 46.5 percent5). Furthermore,
the effectiveness and impact of public spending has been hampered by inadequate budget
allocations to meet the recurrent spending needs of the increased physical capital stock. As a
result many public infrastructures are not operational and cannot provide education and health
services to the needy.
7.
Various business environment and competitiveness indicators rank Chad among the
worst performers compared to its peers. The World Bank‗s ―Doing Business‖ indicators6 and
Governance Indicators rank Chad with the worst scores in almost all studied categories (Figure 3a
and 3b). Similarly, the World Bank‘s Transparency Index ranks Chad very low in that dimension.
The publication of the White Book by the National Council of Employers of Chad was an
important step toward improving Chad‘s business climate. But little progress has been made to
implement the recommendations in the White Book.
8.
The financial sector in Chad is underdeveloped with major challenges to expand
financial access to remote rural areas. Chad has been slowly catching up with its CEMAC peers
in financial deepening and financial inclusion (Figures 4a and 4b). Financial intermediation
indicators improved but still lag far behind the regional average: less than 22 depositors per
1000 adults (compared to 128 for SSA), fewer than 3 borrowers per 1000 adults (compared to
21 for SSA), and less than 1 commercial bank branch per 100,000 adults (compare to 3.7 for SSA).
Microfinance institutions have been expanding slowly over the past two decades and provide
less than 3 percent of domestic credit to the private sector;7 there were more than
150 microfinance institutions registered with the Ministry of Finance and Budget, which suggests
a high degree of fragmentation and high costs given a lack of economies of scale. The policy
actions underway include the implementation of the Microfinance Project in Chad (PROMIFIT)
and the Support Project for Inclusive Financing in Chad (PAFIT).
9.
The coverage of basic infrastructure (energy, water, transport, and
telecommunications) remains weak in Chad. Despite a large increase in public investment on
physical infrastructure over the past decade, the access to safe water and basic sanitation
facilities remain far from the 2015 MDG targets and the regional average. With more than

30 percent of public investment going to transportation, the total distance of paved roads has
increased from 557 km in 2002 to 1602 km in 2011 and is expected to reach almost 2000 km by
the end of 2013. The majority of the Chadian population still lacks access to electricity;
97 percent of the population still uses wood and charcoal for cooking; oil lamp remains the
dominant lighting method used by more than half of the population. The penetration rate of
landline and mobile phones combined increased from 3.7 percent in 2005 to 31.1 percent in
2011. But the inadequate landline infrastructure and broadband network has limited the growth
of landline telephony and internet usage in Chad.

Chad faces great challenges of creating higher-paid jobs with decent working
conditions for its enlarging working population. The National Development Plan 2013-2015
(NDP) estimates that 1.7 million additional jobs are needed between 2010 and 2020 and another
2.5 million jobs need to be created between 2020 and 2030. Chad‘s labor force participation rate
is quite high at 72 percent of the total adult population (age 15+) in 2012. But the majority of the
working population is vulnerable: most workers make limited earnings due to their educational
levels and lack of matching skill sets for decent employment opportunities.
11.
Lack of job training and social protection has failed to improve and protect human
capital. Social protection has been envisioned by the government in its draft National Social
Protection Strategy (NSPS) 2014-2018 as an investment that can break the intergenerational
transmission of poverty and support economic growth. The budget of the National Social
Security Fund (CNPS) has increased steadily from 17.5 billion CFA in 2011 to 22 billion CFA in
2013. But social protection spending remains low and only accounts for 1 percent of the NDP
2013-2015 budget.

POLICY PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS
12.
Smoothing public spending with a medium-term perspective, rationalizing public
investment plans, and improving the efficiency through PFM reforms could help the
government tackle volatile and inefficient public expenditure. Adequate budget allocations for
operation and maintenance of public physical infrastructure need to be ensured, and
accountability of state-owned enterprises needs to be enhanced.
13.
Diversifying the sources of economic growth, in particular promoting the growth of
labor intensive sectors such as the rural sector, will help job creation and sustain economic
growth. Continuous efforts to improve provision of public education and health services will
help form an educated and healthy labor force. Building basic social protection in Chad will help

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

protect human capital. Besides increasing spending on those areas, specific measures are also
needed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of such spending.
14.
Improving the business environment, expanding financial access, and creating
enabling conditions for private sector to grow is critical for Chad to develop a more
diversified and robust economy which will help promote inclusive growth.

Chad’s public domestic and external debt indicators have remained relatively stable
in the last few years. However, the risk of debt distress remains high taking into
account the decision to cancel the non-concessional Master Facility Agreement (MFA)
signed with the Eximbank of China in August 2011 and the contracting of a nonconcessional US$600 million oil sales’ advance operation to cover oil revenue
shortfalls in 2013. The projected steady decline in oil exports and associated fiscal
revenues (barring new discoveries) is a critical challenge over the medium-term
requiring a steady fiscal adjustment and economic diversification.

CHAD

BACKGROUND
Recent Developments in Public External Debt
1.
Chad’s external public debt has hovered around 20 percent of GDP since the start of oil
production in 2003/04. Debt owed to multilateral institutions and traditional bilateral donors has been
basically constant in nominal terms over that period. Chad has instead relied more on non-traditional
creditors (i.e., Libya, China) and commercial credits to address its financing needs, including to tackle its
infrastructure deficit.
2.
The Chadian authorities have taken steps to tackle the debt sustainability concerns raised by
the 2012 Article IV DSA. In December 2013, the authorities formally communicated to Eximbank China
their decision to cancel the US$2 billion (14.9 percent of 2013 GDP) Master Facility Agreement (MFA)
signed in August 2011 noting that the MFA is not legally in force in Chad as it was never formally approved
by the National Assembly and that no disbursement took place under the MFA.
3.
The external public debt-to-GDP ratio is estimated to have risen from 20.9 percent of GDP
in 2012 to 24.1 percent of GDP in 2013 mainly on account of external commercial borrowing in the
form of oil sales’ advances. The authorities signed two agreements in May and August of 2013 for a total
of US$600 million (4.5 percent of GDP) with a commercial partner (Glencore Energy). These two
non-concessional loans carry an annual interest rate of 6.9 percent, on top of an upfront commitment fee
of 2.75 percent, and have to be reimbursed over a two-year period (against crude oil shipments).1

The DSA simulation assumes that the US$600 million loan is amortized over two years starting only in 2014.

The concept of debt used here includes both contracted and guaranteed debt. The end-2011 external public debt stocks are
estimated by staff based on World Bank Debt Reporting System (DRS) end-2010 debt stock, Chad’s debt management office’s
estimates of 2011 disbursements and amortization, and Ministry of Economy and Planning estimates of 2011 project loan
disbursements. The official external debt stock data underestimate the actual level of external debt. Most notably, the debt
registry does not capture the loans from China for the state’s stakes in the joint-venture refinery and in the Baoré cement factory,
and other government-guaranteed debt. Also, project loan disbursements are recognized only after a long lag. Both text tables
have discrepancies with corresponding fiscal or balance of payments flow estimates, giving rise to residuals in the sustainability
analyses.

Status of Implementation of Debt Relief Initiatives
4.
The authorities are seeking to achieve debt relief under the HIPC Initiative. Chad reached the
HIPC decision point in 2001, but several previous efforts to attain the completion point failed due to
political instability, insufficient commitment to reforms, and weak implementation capacity, including
insufficient fiscal controls. In May 2013, the authorities approved a new Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS)
covering the period 2013-15 (a joint IDA-IMF Staff Advisory Note was issued to the Executive Board in
July 2013 (EBD/13/50)). In July 2013, an SMP for the period April-December 2013 was approved by Fund
management, with mixed policy performance so far.2 The World Bank and IMF have been closely working
with the authorities on assessing compliance with the HIPC floating completion point conditions.

2

The SMP aims at sustaining the recent improvements in macroeconomic outcomes, while advancing public financial
management reforms and implementing Chad’s new PRS. Most quantitative targets for end-June and
end-September 2013 were met. However, the oil sales advance operation implied that the ceilings on contracting or

Realizing debt relief under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI) would help reduce external debt up to a half (in nominal terms). Debt relief under
the MDRI would cover the full stock of MDRI-eligible debt owed to IDA and the African Development Fund
that is outstanding at the date that the Completion Point is reached. In nominal terms, this could total
about US$850 million and would imply a reduction in debt service of about US$40 million per year over the
next 20 years.3 A detailed debt reconciliation exercise based on most recent debt data will need to be
conducted to firm up these estimates and include potential debt relief from other creditors before reaching
the HIPC completion point.

Recent Developments in Public Domestic Debt
6.
The stock of public domestic debt has grown, reaching 7.3 percent of GDP at end-2012
(and an estimated 6.9 percent of GDP in 2013). This growth was the result of drawing on central bank
statutory advances, the sale of over CFAF 100 billion of five-year savings bonds (in 2011), and a CFAF
50 billion loan from Republic of Congo (in 2012). The stock of public domestic debt includes a balance of
CFAF 50.3 billion in treasury arrears. In 2013, the authorities placed a five year savings bonds for
CFAF 90.2 billion in the CEMAC regional market with a 6 percent coupon and contracted a CFAF 15 billion
loan from Equatorial Guinea. Treasury arrears have declined to CFAF 42.1 billion at end-October 2013 from
CFAF 50.3 billion at end-December 2012.

Chad reached the decision point under the HIPC Initiative in May 2001. At that time, the amount of HIPC assistance
from the IMF was estimated at SDR 14.3 million in end-2000 PV terms. Debt relief provided by the IMF during the
interim period amounted to SDR 8.55 million (60 percent of total debt relief under the HIPC Initiative). Any remaining
HIPC relief from the Fund will be provided when Chad reaches the completion point, and currently is estimated at
SDR 8.5 million, including SDR 2.8 million—the interest earned on the committed amount in the PRG-HIPC Trust, and
SDR 0.01 million—the interest earned on the Chad’s HIPC Umbrella Account. This amount may be revised at
completion point based on possible revision of the Common Reduction Factor (CRF) in case the decision point (HIPCeligible) debt stock and the corresponding macroeconomic framework are revised. Chad has no MDRI-eligible debt
to the Fund and, therefore, no resource is required from the MDRI-I Trust.

Debt Burden Thresholds under the Debt Sustainability Framework
7.
For the purpose of defining debt burden thresholds under the Debt Sustainability
Framework (DSF), Chad is classified as a weak policy performer. Chad’s rating on the World Bank’s
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) is 2.5 for CY2012 (on a scale from 1 to 6).

DSA ASSUMPTIONS
8.
The assumptions underpinning the DSA have been revised from last year to reflect the
newly adopted policy of a uniform discount rate of 5 percent, the cancellation of the US$2 billion
non concessional MFA, and the contracting of the nonconcessional US$600 million oil sales’
advance operation . The current macroeconomic projections for Chad show a financing gap for 2014 of
CFAF 260 billion. At the time of preparation of this report, there was uncertainty as to how the financing
gap was to be closed. Given limited concessional financing options and the authorities’ strong interest in
reaching the HIPC completion point, a sizable fraction of the financing gap would be covered through fiscal
adjustment, but no determination had been made regarding its extent and nature. In that context, and for
illustrative purposes, the DSA assumes that the 2014 financing gap is financed by external concessional and
domestic borrowing, [in equal proportions]. While the availability of large amounts of concessional and
domestic financing is questionable, this scenario places a more realistic ceiling to Chad’s debt dynamics
over the medium- and long-terms. In the face of it, greater reliance on fiscal adjustment would reduce risks
of external debt distress, while reliance on external nonconcessional borrowing would increase them.
9.
Oil production and revenue: Chad’s medium- and long-term macroeconomic outlook is
characterized by a temporary sharp increase in oil production in 2014–16 and a steady decline of oil
production over the subsequent sixteen-year projection period (Box 1).4

4

Oil production at the Doba oilfield (exploited by the Esso-led consortium) started in 2003, reached its peak of
63 million barrels in 2005 and, absent other oil developments, will decline with annual output projected to become
negligible beyond 2030. In 2011, oil production began at a second oil field, Bongor, operated by CNPC
(about one-third the size of the Doba field). At present, Bongor produces crude oil at a rate of about 15,000 barrels

(continued)

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CHAD



Oil production is expected to rise from 113,000 bpd in 2012 to about 173,000 bpd in
2015-16. This second oil boom will likely be temporary; proven reserves in the new fields are
much smaller than that in the original Doba basin and will also likely be nearly exhausted
around 2030. Hence, oil production and exports are projected to decline steadily to
negligible levels beyond 2030. Obviously, these prospects might change with new oil
exploration activities.



Chad’s oil trades below the WEO reference price, reflecting a quality discount and transport5
cost. For the medium term (five-year horizon) the price of Chadian oil is assumed to drop
from US$102.8 per barrel (all discounts included) in 2013 to about US$83.6 per barrel in
2017–18, in line with the trend projected in the IMF’s World Economic Outlook (WEO). From
2019 onward, the price is assumed to increase 3 percent per year in U.S. dollar terms
(consistent with the assumption used by the IMF in long-term projections for other
sub-Saharan African countries).

10.
Fiscal policy: The analysis assumes a sustained fiscal adjustment throughout the entire projection
in transition to the post-oil era, with the non-oil primary deficit (NOPD) reduced from about 16 percent of
non-oil GDP in 2014 to 12 percent of non-oil GDP by 2018. The increase in oil production over the
medium-term is expected to help maintain oil revenues above 15 percent of non-oil GDP until 2016. Over
the longer term, it is assumed that dwindling oil revenues will be partly offset by a decline of total
government primary spending from 30.4 percent of non-oil GDP in 2013 to 21.6 percent in 2033, while the
primary balance will be adjusted gradually to reach a small deficit of 0.3 percent of non-oil GDP by 2033.
The latter is projected to be achieved mainly by: (i) increasing non-oil revenues (from about 8.5 percent of
non-oil GDP at present to about 17 percent of non-oil GDP by 2033); (ii) reducing total investment outlays
from over 14 percent of non-oil GDP to below 10 percent of non-oil GDP; and (iii) cutting recurrent
spending, notably, by streamlining exceptional security transfers and subsidies to public enterprises (at
present, jointly accounting for about 6.5 percent of non-oil GDP).
11.
The DSA analysis is conducted over a baseline (current policies) scenario that reflects the
stated intentions of the authorities to pursue fiscal consolidation, while protecting priority spending and
investing adequately in physical infrastructure to prepare the country for the post-oil era. While the
baseline scenario is consistent with the medium-term fiscal framework presented in the staff report for the
Article IV 2013 consultation, it assumes that the projected financing gap for 2014 is financed through
external concessional and domestic loans. In 2013, however, owing to the Glencore operation, 81 percent
of new foreign borrowings are contracted on commercial terms. Commercial borrowing is assumed to fall

per day as feedstock for the oil refinery, resulting in a near complete substitution of petroleum product imports.
Exports of crude oil from Bongor are expected to start in 2014 and reach 65,000 bpd in 2015. Oil from another
smaller operator (Caracal, formerly Griffiths) started to be produced in late 2013 and are expected to peak at
40,000 bpd in 2015.
5

The discount was fairly constant (about US$6.50) until recently when it dropped to about US$2.50 due to the
disruption of oil exports from South Sudan, which increased the demand for (a very similar) Chadian oil. This discount
is expected to rebound over the near term to its normal level.

to 0 percent of new external borrowing from 2014 onward and the financing plan assumes the following
composition for gross borrowing: 52 percent multilateral, 48 percent bilateral. Hence, the grant element is
assumed to improve rapidly in 2014-15 and average 34-35 percent over the medium and long run.
Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions, 2013–2033
Baseline Scenario:
Real GDP growth is driven by a sharp growth of oil production in the next three years and a steady decline in oil production over the
following seventeen years. A moderate scaling-up of foreign-financed investments (see below) is assumed to raise non-oil GDP growth
in the medium term (5.5 percent in 2014–18). Beyond that, non-oil GDP growth is assumed to stabilize at 4.6 percent in the long term.
Inflation is assumed to stabilize at 3 percent, consistent with the CEMAC convergence criterion. The external current account will
remain in deficit throughout the forecasting period although it will shrink slightly in 2014–16, with the increase in oil exports and the
drop in imports as the development of the new oil fields and the oil refinery allows for the substitution of oil product imports. With the
decline in oil exports in the long-term, the external current account is projected to turn into a higher deficit.
The fiscal outlook features a temporary increase in oil revenues in the medium term but a decline in the long term. The authorities are
assumed to reduce the NOPD to 12 percent of non-oil GDP by 2018. In the medium and long term, the authorities adjust by increasing
non-oil revenue effort, streamlining exceptional security spending and subsidies to public enterprises, while maintaining an
appropriately high level of investment and social spending to ensure steady growth and poverty reduction.
External financing: Project loans are assumed to pick up from 1.4 percent of non-oil GDP in 2013 to 2.5 percent of non-oil GDP over
2015-19 and then fall to 2.1 percent of non-oil GDP in the long term. Project grants will increase from 2.4 percent of non-oil GDP in
2013 to 2.6 percent of non-oil GDP over the entire forecasting period. This is assumed based on historical averages, with 60 percent
grants and 40 percent in loans from official multilateral and bilateral creditors. The baseline does not take into account HIPC and MDRI
debt relief for which Chad is eligible.
The domestic financing assumptions include reimbursement of BEAC statutory advances by 2015, no accrual of domestic arrears, and
limited issuance of domestic debt instruments from 2015 onward..

EXTERNAL DEBT DSA
Baseline (Current Policies) Scenario
12.
The evolution of external debt is driven by a reasonable volume of project and budget
support loans from both traditional and non-traditional donors. There is no external private debt in
Chad. Starting in 2014, new borrowing is projected to be mainly on concessional terms from Paris Club
official (20 percent) and non-Paris Club official (28 percent) sources as well as multilateral (52 percent)
sources. Hence, the average concessionality of new borrowing (assuming a discount rate of 5 percent)
would increase towards 34-35 percent and stay so through the projection period (Figure 1a).
13.
The comparison of the current baseline scenario with the baseline featured in the 2012 DSA
reveals some differences reflecting a significant change in Chad’s borrowing policy (Figures 5–7). This
change is mainly explained by the cancellation of the MFA.
14.
Under the baseline scenario, all but one external indebtedness indicators remain below
their critical thresholds, indicating a high risk of external debt distress. The present value of external
public and publicly-guaranteed debt falls below 15 percent of GDP starting in 2015 and remains well below
the 30 percent of GDP threshold throughout the end of the projection horizon (Figure 1). With the
projected steady decline in oil exports beyond the 2013–16 horizon, the PV of debt is expected to rise
relative to exports, and projected to exceed the critical threshold starting around 2020. The PV of debt
relative to both revenue and GDP would remain below thresholds through the end of the projection
period. This is also the case for debt service in percent of revenues and exports.6

Stress Tests
15.
Under the shock scenario that assumes that key macroeconomic variables remain at their
ten-year average values, the debt burden indicators do not breach the sustainability thresholds.
However, Chad’s external debt burden indicators are highly sensitive to a negative shock to exports (e.g., an
oil price shock). Across all indicative debt burden thresholds, the most extreme shock is a drop in export
growth in 2014–15 (i.e., proportional to a two-standard-deviation lower oil price): debt would be on a path
breaching all indicative debt burden thresholds. This underscores the need for greater diversification of the
economy.

6

Under an alternative scenario where the authorities continue to rely partially (for about 45 percent of total gross
external borrowings) on non-concessional loans, all but two external debt indicators breach their respective
sustainability thresholds. The debt service-to-revenue ratio exceeds the critical threshold starting in 2015 and
remains above the threshold until the late 2020s. Both the PV of debt-to-exports and the debt service-to-exports
ratios exceed the critical thresholds starting around 2018-20 and remain above thresholds through the end of the
projection period. The PV of debt relative to both revenue and GDP would remain below thresholds through the end
of the projection period.

CHAD

PUBLIC DEBT DSA
16.
The inclusion of domestic debt in the analysis does not fundamentally alter the assessment
of Chad’s debt sustainability. Given the moderate size of Chad’s domestic debt, the baseline adjustment
in the non-oil primary balance, and expected oil revenues, the public debt indicators are driven mainly by
the external debt component. The domestic debt component would fall from 7.3 percent of GDP in 2012 to
2.4 percent of GDP in 2018 but will continuously rise thereafter until it reaches about 6.7 percent of GDP
2033. Altogether, the public debt stock decreases to about 25 percent of GDP in 2017 before rising
continuously until it stabilizes around 33 percent of GDP in 2031-33.
17.
Despite this relatively low debt stock, standard stress tests indicate significant sustainability
risks. In particular, reflecting the narrow base of an economy highly dependent on volatile oil and
agriculture sectors, a temporary shock to real GDP growth in 2014-2015 would substantially impair public
debt sustainability (Most Extreme Shock in Figure 2 and Bound Test B1 in Table 2a).

THE AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS
18.
The authorities believe that improved oil revenue prospects and debt relief through the
HIPC process would substantially dampen debt sustainability concerns. The authorities acknowledged
potential concerns on debt sustainability and highlighted the recent decision to cancel the MFA with
Eximbank China as a signal of the importance that they attach to this issue and to the need for
concessional long-term financing. Regarding the latter, they noted that the recent lending operation with
Glencore Energy was an extraordinary measure in response to a temporary shock that was aimed at
ensuring that the existing budgetary envelope could be fully financed and did not result in an expansion in
budgetary spending. They consider that staff oil revenue projections are overly conservative, stressing
existing oil exploration activities and the potential opening of new exploration rounds after a soon to be
conducted geological mapping exercise. Finally, they emphasized the need for debt relief to create fiscal
space for additional development spending (including foreign-financed). They finally expect that ongoing
reform progress will be reflected in an improvement of the CPIA score and a related increase in external
debt burden thresholds.

DEBT DISTRESS CLASSIFICATION AND CONCLUSIONS
19.
In staff’s assessment, despite improved oil production and revenue prospects in the next
few years, Chad faces a high risk of debt distress. This is due to the significant decline in oil exports and
revenues over the medium to the long terms. While the government’s decision to cancel the US$2 billion
non concessional MFA with the Eximbank of China would significantly improve the debt distress rating
compared to the 2012 Article IV DSA, Chad would remain at a high risk of debt distress despite a sustained
fiscal adjustment unless it adopts a prudent external borrowing policy. Sustained fiscal adjustment is a
necessary but not sufficient condition for minimizing the risk of debt distress. Given the exhaustibility and
volatility of oil revenues, fiscal adjustment needs to be complemented by a prudent external borrowing
policy and further progress in diversifying the economy.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CHAD

20.
Progress toward the HIPC completion point (including improvements in the CPIA score)
would substantially reduce Chad’s debt vulnerabilities. In addition to continued pursuit of fiscal
consolidation and a prudent external borrowing policy, institutional and governance reforms should pave
the way for debt relief under the HIPC process and increased access to concessional borrowing sources,
thereby reducing the country’s debt vulnerabilities.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Safeguards Assessments
The Bank of the Central African States (BEAC) is the regional central bank of the Central African
Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC). As with other regional central banks, the BEAC is
subject to a safeguards assessment every four years. The 2013 quadrennial assessment, which was
completed on November 14, spans a period of extensive change at the BEAC and occurs against the
backdrop of extensive plans and measures initiated to address governance challenges and control
failures that emerged in 2009. A series of safeguards “rolling measures” were agreed between the
BEAC and the IMF, as a basis since 2009 to move forward with new IMF program requests and
reviews for BEAC members using IMF resources. The BEAC also initiated an action plan with the aim
of reforming its governance, strengthening key safeguards, and building capacity. The 2013
assessment found that the BEAC has made some progress in reinforcing its safeguards framework,
but risks remain elevated and further reforms are needed to fully restore sound governance and
control. Although the internal audit mechanism has improved with the establishment of a separate
Directorate and greater interaction with the audit committee, the implementation of the BEAC
reform and modernization plan, initially adopted in 2011, is slower than planned and its target
completion date has been delayed to 2014. Governance at the BEAC continues to be undermined by
a legal framework that does not adequately protect institutional autonomy, and problematic partial
adherence of several member states to the reserves pooling obligation that is fundamental to the
operation of the currency union. The assessment also indicated that continued weaknesses in
governance are exacerbated by a number of risks, including a less secure environment for the
accounting and IT systems that raises concerns about the quality of financial controls and
information. The assessment identified measures needed to strengthen the safeguards framework,
including through further capacity building, amendments to the BEAC charter, and significant effort
and commitment to achieve implementation of the reform and modernization plan.
Exchange Rate Arrangement
Chad maintains an exchange system that is reportedly free from restrictions and multiple currency
practices on payments and transfers for current international transactions. The BEAC common
currency is the CFA franc which, since January 1, 1999, has been pegged to the euro at the rate of
EUR 1 = CFAF 655.957.
Article IV Consultations
Chad is on the 12-month cycle. The next Article IV consultation is expected to take place by
February 2015.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has capacity-related shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. There is
scope for improvement in quality, coverage, and timeliness in most macroeconomic datasets. The authorities
have recently taken the initiative to improve the macroeconomic database, particularly the national accounts.
The 2007 Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) found that the statistical system was weak
and suffers from a shortage of both financial and human resources.
National accounts: The authorities have revised national accounts estimates, moving from the 1968 System of
National Accounts (SNA) to the 1993 SNA and rebasing the data to 2005 as the base year. Final Annual
National Accounts are available until 2010 and have been backcasted through 1995-2005. Provisional figures
are also available for 2011-2012. However, compilation remains weak owing to inadequate funding for the
Institut National de la Statistique, des Etudes Economiques et Démographiques (INSEED) and high staff
turnover. In addition, dissemination of data and metadata to the public could be improved by more timely
releases, provision of more detailed information, and enhanced dissemination through the internet.
Price statistics: The Harmonized Consumer Price Index (HCPI) is of rather good quality. However, it covers
only the capital city and the reporting lag sometimes exceeds two months. The regional authorities are working
underway to improve the quality of the HCPI in each of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community
(CEMAC) countries.
Government finance statistics: Data weaknesses create uncertainty about the central government’s actual
fiscal position and hamper debt sustainability analysis. Staff is compelled to prepare estimates of central
government financial operations from disparate administrative sources that may or may not fully reconcile with
domestic bank financing or changes in net indebtedness.
Monetary statistics: Banque des Etats de L’Afrique Centrale (BEAC) reports the expected core monetary and
financial indicators, within the expected lag, through the standardized report forms (SRFs). A key shortcoming
of monetary and financial statistics is the lack of clear reconciliation between the domestic banking sector’s net
credit to the government and the implicit financing in the weak government financial accounts. In addition, the
depository corporations’ survey omits the large number of microfinance operations in the country.
Balance of payments: Weaknesses in Chad’s balance of payments data create uncertainty about its actual
external position and hamper debt sustainability analysis. Customs-based data are unreliable and suffer from
coverage problems, to the extent that they are not relied upon for balance of payments or national income
estimation. BEAC prepares balance of payments data and submit to BEAC headquarters for validation with the
long time lag. Staff must estimate current and capital flows from disparate administrative sources, to
supplement the official balance of payments. Using recently updated figures from BEAC, staff revised some BOP
historical data but there was neither a change in methodology nor a significant revision of previous values. The
IMF Statistics Department has recommended tighter coordination among the CEMAC, INSEED, and other
agencies in order to improve data coverage. BEAC headquarters is coordinating technical reforms to improve
data quality and timeliness.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Chad has been a participant in the IMF’s GDDS since A Data ROSC was published in August 2007.
September 24, 2002. GDDS metadata and plans for
improvement need to be updated.
III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
Only international liquidity, monetary statistics, GDP, and prices are currently reported to STA for publication in
the International Financial Statistics (IFS). Chad has not yet been able to resume reporting of detailed data for
publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. Annual fiscal data through 2001 have been reported
and are included in the IFS database. The BEAC has yet to submit test monetary and financial statistics using
the standardized report forms. Chad has yet to submit BOP and IIP data to STA.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 27, 2014

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Chad
On February 21, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Chad.
Macroeconomic performance continued to be stable in 2013, with some deceleration in
economic growth and inflation. Real GDP is projected to have grown by 3.6 percent in 2013,
down from 8.9 percent in 2012. The slowdown reflects a reduction in oil GDP of 3.9 percent
in 2013 due to a sharper than expected decline in the mature field’s oil production and delays
in new oil production. Non-oil GDP is forecast to have grown by 5 percent in 2013
compared to 11.6 percent in 2012, mainly reflecting a return to trend agricultural production
levels after the bumper harvest that took place in 2012. Inflation fell sharply in 2013 due to a
sizable fall in food prices following the strong harvest in 2012. Consequently, annual average
inflation rate is projected at around 0.4 percent, compared to 7.7 percent in 2012.
The external current account deficit averaged 8 percent of GDP between 2009 and 2012 and
is projected to have deteriorated further to 8.8 percent of GDP in 2013 on account of the drop
in oil exports. The overall balance of payments would record a deficit in 2013, the first time
since 2009, bringing the international reserve coverage ratio to about 1.7 months of imports
of goods and services (compared to 2.4 months in 2012).
Fiscal policy has been gradually tightened over the last few years, anchored on reductions in
the non-oil primary deficit (NOPD). NOPD fell by 1 percent of non-oil GDP over 2011-12
and the 2013 budget was anchored on a further 1 percent of non-oil GDP reduction in the
NOPD to 18.2 percent of non-oil GDP. However, the 2013 budget execution was affected by
an unexpected fall in oil revenue and spending pressures from regional security operations,
resulting in an overall fiscal deficit of about 6 percent of non-oil GDP (compared to a surplus

Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

of 1.7 percent of non-oil GDP in 2012). This deficit was partly financed by non-concessional
borrowing against future oil receipts.
The medium-term economic outlook is driven by developments in oil production and
associated fiscal revenue. Real GDP is projected to grow at around 9 percent per year over
2014–15 as new oil-related projects come fully on-stream. Oil GDP is projected to peak in
2016 and fall steadily thereafter absent new oil discoveries. Non-oil GDP is projected to
grow by around 5 percent per year over the medium term, driven by agriculture, commerce,
and transportation. The main sources of risk to the outlook stem from the volatility of fiscal
oil revenue and the difficult regional security situation.
Executive Board Assessment2
Directors welcomed Chad’s relatively strong macroeconomic performance amidst
considerable regional insecurity, characterized by solid non-oil GDP growth and relatively
muted inflation. They also commended the authorities’ significant contribution to regional
security efforts. Noting that a decade of rapid economic growth has not significantly reduced
poverty rates, Directors called for decisive policy measures to achieve diversified, inclusive
growth and improved socioeconomic outcomes.
Directors noted that, despite the positive medium-term outlook, Chad is facing challenges
from the volatility and trend decline in oil revenue. While welcoming the improved fiscal
stance in recent years, including under the staff-monitored program, they advised building
fiscal buffers over the medium term, by enhancing domestic revenue mobilization, public
financial management, public sector efficiency and expenditure prioritization. Directors
welcomed the recent commitment to limit the use of extra-budgetary emergency spending
procedures, and recommended careful prioritization of public investment in line with
absorptive capacity. Efforts to significantly reduce the non-oil tax collection gap, building
on progress and by following through on Fund technical assistance recommendations
regarding tax policy and revenue administration, will be crucial.
Directors called for greater coherence in the authorities’ debt management strategy and a
prudent external borrowing policy, given Chad’s high risk of debt distress. They
acknowledged the authorities’ commitment to ensuring debt sustainability, as evidenced by
the cancelation of the Master Facility Agreement with Eximbank China. While recognizing
the exceptional circumstances that led to the nonconcessional oil sale advances in 2013, they
advised against recourse to such advances going forward, and stressed the need for corrective
actions to cover the ensuing financing gap in 2014. Directors looked forward to the timely
preparation of the new debt management law, and recommended centralization of debt
approvals and operational management. They supported the authorities’ commitment to
achieve the completion point under the Enhanced Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. An explanation of any
qualifiers used in summing up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Countries. They looked forward to continued close engagement with the Fund in the period
ahead, including discussions on reaching agreement on a possible ECF-supported program.
Directors underscored the importance of critical structural reforms to help boost external
competitiveness and promote diversified, inclusive growth. They called for the removal of
key supply-side bottlenecks and measures to strengthen the business climate. Directors
commended the authorities’ initiatives under the National Development Plan, designed to
raise agricultural productivity and promote infrastructure investment. They also advised the
authorities to implement reforms conducive to enhanced financial sector development and
inclusion.

Statement by Kossi Assimaidou, Executive Director and Ngueto Tiraina
Yambaye Alternate Executive Director for Chad
February 21, 2014
On behalf of our Chadian authorities, we thank the Executive Board and Management for the
support to their policy efforts in a very challenging environment. Our authorities are very much
appreciative of the policy and reform advice provided by staff.
In spite of a difficult regional environment, Chad’s macroeconomic indicators continued to
improve in 2013, with real GDP estimated to have grown by more than 3.5 percent helped by
strong growth in the non-oil sector. Inflation has remained subdued. Fiscal policy continued to
be tightened, in spite of the spending pressures associated with the regional security situation. In
this regard, it is to be noted that Chad has contributed actively to international efforts to restore
order in Mali and is also meeting recurrent expenditures for border security and assistance to
refugees from neighboring countries. Although the international community has promised
assistance to Chad to meet these costs, none has been received yet.
At the same time the authorities have implemented successfully a Staff-Monitored Program
approved by management in July 2013. The 2013 underlying fiscal policy stance, as measured by
the non-oil primary deficit (NOPD), is in line with the programmed target. Fiscal consolidation
was achieved amid those unexpected security outlays and downward revisions to oil and non-oil
revenue projections.
Despite the policy discipline, a series of unforeseen and concurrent events in 2013 led to
relatively large financing needs. First, oil revenue fell short of original projections due to several
temporary shocks. Second, the government needed to respond quickly to the regional security
situation through: (i) Chad’s participation to the international military campaign in Mali; (ii)
humanitarian assistance to refugees from the Central African Republic; and (iii) increased security
spending within and at Chad’s borders to cope with terrorism threats. On top of that, there was
some uncertainty about the timing of the envisaged sources of financing, notably placements of
debt in the regional market. All this forced the Chadian authorities to resort to oil sales’
advances. The authorities are aware of the impact of the
latter on 2014 fiscal prospects and are committed to take remedial actions to mitigate them,
including through a revised 2014 budget and through improved coordination within government
throughout the debt management process.
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STAFF-MONITORED PROGRAM
As of end-September, the performance relative to quantitative indicators under the SMP was
encouraging. Accordingly, five out of seven quantitative targets have been met, mostly with
comfortable margins. The authorities also implemented strong measures as regards tax
collections—which have helped improve non-oil revenue—and contained overall spending
within the program limits.

2
The two missed targets (ceiling on contracting or guaranteeing new non-concessional external
public debt and new guaranteed external debt contracted or guaranteed by the government
and/or non-financial public enterprises) are both explained by the resort to the oil sales advances
under extraordinary circumstances that the authorities believe did not merit a revision of the
underlying policy stance.
On the structural front, most benchmarks for 2013 are expected to be met albeit some with
delay. These include: (i) the reconciliation of treasury and central bank data on net claims of the
banking system on the government at end-2012; (ii) the submission to Parliament of the 2014
draft budget in line with the objective of gradual reduction of the NOPD; and (iii) the limit to
emergency spending procedures (Dépenses avant ordonnancement, DAOs). On the latter, it is
important to note that regulations have also been issued to strictly limit their use; a monitoring
committee has been established and now meets on a regular basis; and a commission to ensure
rapid regularization of DAOs has been put in place, in line with Fund technical assistance
recommendations. The institutional and technical complexity of a remaining structural
measure—preparing and updating a monthly treasury cash management plan—makes it difficult
to integrate cash planning with public procurement plans and, therefore, challenging to meet the
benchmark within the lifespan of the SMP.
The government acknowledges the importance of improving debt management and is
committed to enhancing the capacity of the two structures in charge of providing binding
opinions on all new loans proposals (the Chadian Team on Debt Analysis and Sustainability,
ETAVID, and the National Commission for Debt Analysis, CONAD)—the last structural
benchmark. The authorities also strive to strengthen communication within the government, and
between the government and the Fund on debt-related issues. In this regard, the government
has received and will continue to receive technical assistance from the World Bank and AFRITAC
Central to improve debt management.
Encouraged by the results of their action in consolidating macroeconomic stability and
implementing public financial management reforms, including on DAOs and automated systems
for payments and accounting, the Chadian authorities feel strongly about the satisfactory
implementation of their SMP to end-2013, and look forward to the final assessment under the
program.
MEDIUM-TERM POLICY CHALLENGES
Our Chadian authorities are encouraged by the current policy results and medium-term growth
outlook. It is their intention to build on this progress and to implement policies that will ensure
sustained macroeconomic stability, strong poverty reduction and smooth structural
transformation of the Chadian economy, in spite of the challenging environment.
Regarding the dependence on oil sector developments, while the Chadian authorities are
convinced of the need to diversify the economy and sources of revenue, they believe that the
existing and potential oil exploration activities in new fields should provide them some leeway in

3
conducting the necessary structural reforms while allowing fiscal space for public investment in a
gradual but steadfast fiscal consolidation plan. It is the view of the Chadian authorities that such
strategy should lean on a medium-term program with the Fund which itself should reflect the
objectives laid out in Chad’s National Development Plan.
Fiscal Policies and Reforms
The Chadian authorities are cognizant of the necessity to increase non-oil revenue. They
appreciate staff’s analysis on non-oil tax potential and the need to bridge the gap through tax
policy and administration reforms. They intend to build on the progress made recently to further
advance fiscal reforms in line with Fund recommendations. The actions already taken or
underway include notably reductions in tax exemptions, ongoing harmonization of the tax code
with the CEMAC requirements, and current efforts to automate major customs offices.
On the expenditure side, the Chadian authorities are pursuing efforts to limit use of DAOs to
cases of truly urgent situations and to regularize them systematically. They are streamlining
government accounts at commercial banks to better control cash management; and, in the same
vein, they will put in place an accounting IT system this year to improve the reliability of
accounting. On procurement, the authorities have confirmed their intention to resume the
publication of procurement bulletins in early 2014 and increase the share of public contracts that
are awarded through a competitive bidding. More broadly, they share the view that tackling PFM
weaknesses is critical to improve fiscal control and enhance public spending efficiency.
Debt Sustainability
Beside the reactivation of the two structures in charge of recommending, approving and
monitoring debt operations, the Chadian authorities are making efforts on various fronts to
maintain debt sustainability. They are preparing a public debt management law aimed at
distributing responsibilities for steps throughout the whole debt process and at better
coordinating actions.
An important indication of Chad’s commitment to debt sustainability is the decision to cancel the
Master Facility Agreement (MFA) with Eximbank of China which would have been used for
infrastructure projects. Our authorities remain committed to continue efforts to obtain
concessional resources—which remain scarce—to finance highly-needed basic and
transformational infrastructure. This approach together with expected debt relief under the HIPC
Initiative, will help reduce the risk of debt distress facing Chad. It is, therefore, critical that Chad
reaches the HIPC Completion point as soon as possible. Our Chadian authorities continue to view
this milestone as a priority, and are making every effort to meet all its associated prerequisites.
Structural Competitiveness and Transformation
Chad endeavors to transform its economy by diversifying its sources of growth towards
agriculture and livestock sectors which also carry strong potential to make growth more

4
inclusive. The authorities are committed to further enhance the business environment. They
intend to do so in consultation with the private sector as highlighted in their long-term
development strategy. Tackling the inadequate infrastructure and public services—notably
electricity, roads, water supply—as well as the high transaction costs, remain priorities in their
structural reform agenda, with the view to strengthen competitiveness.
Building on strengthened stability of the banking system achieved through the recent
restructuring of state-owned banks, further actions in the financial sector will be geared at
increasing access to financial services, notably in rural areas, and developing the microfinance
sector.
CONCLUSION
Institutional and financial constraints remain key impediments to Chad reaching its development
objectives. In this regard, the Fund can play a critical role in providing needed technical
assistance, especially in the fiscal area, and in catalyzing donor resources while assisting in efforts
to meet the requirements for debt relief under the HIPC Initiative. As experiences of fragile states
show, strong involvement of the Fund is critical to alleviating institutional and policy capacity
constraints, and catalyzing the necessary financial support. Chad urgently needs this assistance to
make further progress towards mobilizing the resources (domestic revenue, debt relief, external
support) needed to meet its long-term development challenges while preserving debt
sustainability. Our Chadian authorities have designed a second-generation growth and poverty
reduction strategy embodied in their National Development Plan (NDP) 2013-2015 which will
guide their actions going forward. They are seeking adequate resources to implement the NDP
and, in this vein, they plan to gather a donor round-table in the first half of 2014, and are hopeful
that it will receive the full support of the international community. In this regard, the authorities
believe that the strong policy performance of recent years and under the SMP should be
recognized by a Fund financial arrangement that provides the framework for a swift organization
of the donor round-table and the achievement of debt relief under the HIPC Initiative. We would,
therefore, appreciate Directors’ full support for a follow-up medium term program under the
ECF.
