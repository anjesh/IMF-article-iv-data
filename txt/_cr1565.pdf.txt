STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND FIRST REVIEW UNDER THE EXTENDED ARRANGEMENT

KEY ISSUES
Context, outlook, and risks. Armenia’s economic environment has become more
complex, particularly due to adverse external developments. Growth is expected to slow
to 2.6 percent of GDP in 2014 and accelerate gradually over the medium term. Key risks
include geopolitical developments in the region (Russia, Ukraine, Nagorno-Karabakh).
Fiscal policy. Fiscal policy is sustainable. However, continued capital budget
underexecution is a concern. The draft 2015 budget envisages increased capital
spending to help support growth. Fiscal reforms are advancing, but further revenue
gains are needed to address pressing social and investment needs.
Monetary and financial sector. Monetary policy has turned accommodative in
response to weakening demand and lower inflation, but will need to remain vigilant in
light of rising global rates and excess liquidity in the banking system. The banking sector
remains robust and well capitalized, but a recent increase in NPLs warrants monitoring.
The authorities are strengthening financial sector regulation and resilience.
External stability. While consolidation has continued, the current account deficit is
expected to remain high over the medium term. International reserves are adequate.
Staff estimates suggest that an adjustment of the real exchange rate over the medium
term, together with structural reforms, would facilitate further external adjustment.
Structural reforms. More forceful reforms would improve Armenia’s capacity to grow,
create jobs, and reduce poverty. The authorities should move faster to bolster the
flagship pension reform to ensure its long-run success. They should leverage Eurasian
Economic Union (EEU) membership to increase exports, improve standards, enhance
domestic competition, and invest in infrastructure, while pursuing greater trade
integration beyond the EEU.
Program. The program is broadly on track. All PCs and most ITs were met. There were
some delays in meeting structural benchmarks, mainly due to the government change in
mid-2014 rather than a change in policy direction. The authorities are requesting that
the equivalent of SDR 11.74 million become available with completion of the review.
Article IV. Discussions focused on reducing vulnerabilities and boosting potential
growth via: (i) overcoming fiscal underspending; (ii) more exchange rate flexibility to
facilitate external adjustment; (iii) additional dedollarization measures; and (iv) more
ambitious structural reforms to improve competitiveness and inclusiveness.

CONTEXT AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
Armenia’s economic environment has become more complex, particularly due to adverse
external developments—slow growth in Russia and the EU and uncertainty regarding the
crisis in Ukraine, including sanctions and counter-measures. A challenging domestic
policy environment is also playing a role, most notably setbacks in the implementation of
the pension reform. In spite of these challenges, the Fund-supported program remains on
track and its objectives highly relevant.
1.
Recovery from the 2009 crisis is in place, but significant challenges persist. Growth has
been reestablished after a 14 percent contraction in 2009, while major reductions in the fiscal and
current account have been simultaneously achieved. Nonetheless, significant challenges remain, as
the economy has not yet developed a robust alternative to the pre-crisis construction-led growth
model, public, private and foreign investment remains suppressed, and the economy has struggled
to generate sufficient jobs to stem emigration and reduce poverty. The still-high current account
deficit and financial dollarization remain sources of vulnerability.
2.
Cooperation between Armenia and the Fund has remained strong. A Fund-supported
program was in place during 2010–13 and was completed with minor delays and few missed targets.
More recently, a new 38-month arrangement was approved in March 2014 aimed at helping
consolidate stability and buffers against possible external shocks and supporting growth through
further reforms in the transition towards a dynamic emerging market economy. Beyond the program
relationship, Armenia and the Fund have maintained a continuous dialog regarding policy
challenges, and recent policy implementation has been consistent with past Fund advice (Box 1).
There has also been close cooperation through Fund technical assistance.
3.
Armenia’s economic environment has become more complex in 2014. Externally, growth
in Armenia’s largest trading partners, Russia and the EU, has been weaker than expected, affecting
exports and remittances. The slowdown in Russia—driven by both structural and geopolitical
developments, including sanctions, represents a particular challenge, along with depreciation of the
ruble. Domestically, the government has yet to overcome significant budget underexecution—
particularly on capital expenditures—and the roll-out of the long-planned pension reform has
experienced difficulties.
4.
A new government, in place since May, has stressed continuity. The new government
was formed following the resignation of Prime Minister Tigran Sargsyan in April, after six years in
office. Major actions to date have included: merging the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the State
Revenue Committee (SRC); narrowing the scope of the pension reform after demonstrations and a
ruling that some of its provisions were unconstitutional; implementation of an open skies policy in
civil aviation; and concluding steps on accession to the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU).

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

Box 1. Policies since the 2012 Article IV Consultation
Macroeconomic policies have been in line with past staff advice. The 2012 consultation called for: (i)
greater tax revenue mobilization to strengthen the fiscal outlook; (ii) continuing monetary and financial
sector reforms; and (iii) greater exchange rate flexibility to underpin external consolidation and sustainability.
Since 2012, the authorities have increased revenue mobilization and reduced the underlying fiscal deficit,
although the latter also reflected fiscal under-spending, mainly on capital projects. Monetary and exchange
rate policies helped maintain price stability and supported external adjustment, as evidenced by the
gradually declining external current account deficit. The authorities have implemented most of the
recommendations from the 2012 FSAP Update, including: establishing minimum foreign currency liquidity
ratios, introducing the use of Basel II Pillar II supervisory techniques, and preparing supporting regulations
for the pension reform.
The authorities also made progress in implementing structural reforms, albeit with some delays.
The 2012 consultations called for improvements to the business climate and competitiveness that were
supported by the 2010 and 2014 Fund arrangements. Tax administration and financial reforms to improve
business conditions have generally advanced. The authorities are continuing with the implementation of the
flagship pension reforms, launched in January 2014, although these faced obstacles and were modified. The
“open skies” framework for civil aviation is in place and delivering increased flights at lower costs. However,
competition and regulatory reforms have advanced at a slower-than-expected pace. More broadly, while
progress has been registered, a decisive breakthrough on structural reforms has not been achieved, with
consequences for private and foreign investment.

5.
Growth has softened, and inflation fell below the CBA’s target range of 4±1.5 percent.
Growth in the first half of 2014 was 2.7 percent (vis-à-vis 3.5 percent in 2013), as growth of exports
and remittances slowed, and government spending was lower than budgeted. The slowdown was
broad based, although construction, which has declined since the 2009 crisis, was relatively flat.
Inflation through September was just 1.5 percent, primarily driven by low food inflation.

The banking sector remains profitable, but performance has weakened. Slower
economic growth has been accompanied by an increase in NPLs, which reached 6.5 percent in
September, a reduction of profitability, slower credit and deposits growth, and a small reduction in
the capital adequacy ratio. In addition, competition among banks for clients in a weaker economic
environment has reduced lending-deposit spreads, putting additional downward pressure on
profitability.

Monetary conditions have eased, in line with policy decisions. An easing cycle initiated
by the CBA in November of 2013 has continued, with the policy rate declining by 1.75 percentage
points to reach 6.75 percent in August. This was accompanied by a reduction of reserve
requirements for dram deposits from 4 to 2 percent in March. With budget underexecution and
funding from last year’s Eurobond, the MOF has stayed out of the T-bill market, and short-term Tbill and

Overcoming underexecution has proved to be a difficult task, as the causes vary depending on the project. For the
North-South Highway, issues include complex land acquisition, resettlement, and archeological work. A new on-line
procurement framework that aims at arm’s-length transactions and improved transparency and governance may also
be contributing to delays.

10.
Uncertainty on EEU membership eased with signing of the accession treaty in October.
On October 10, the presidents of Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia, signed an agreement on
Armenia’s membership. Armenia is expected to formally join the Union in January, once the treaty is
ratified by the four national parliaments (Annex I).
11.
The Fund-supported program is on track and its objectives remain highly relevant.
Despite adverse external developments and policy challenges, all end-June PCs, all continuous PCs,
and most ITs and SBs were met. The objectives of the program—to consolidate stability and buffers
against possible external shocks and to support growth—remain particularly relevant in the current
environment.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
With low growth in trading partners, activity in Armenia is expected to remain subdued
in 2014–15 and to recover only gradually in the medium term. Significant downside risks
exist, particularly connected with Russia, given substantial interlinkages via trade,
remittances, bank flows, and FDI.

weaker than expected at the time of program
approval in March, by 0.8 percent of GDP, due to slower export and remittance growth. Gross
international reserves will also be lower than expected, given the weaker current account and other
factors, such as the loss of EU financing. The authorities broadly shared staff views on the outlook,
but argued that growth could be higher in 2015 and beyond, reflecting strong performance in
agriculture, services, and light industry, as well as potential increases in FDI catalyzed by EEU
accession.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

13.
Significant downside risks exist (see Risk Assessment Matrix). A worsening of global
financial conditions and protracted slow growth in advanced and emerging markets could have an
adverse impact on Armenia’s outlook via lower exports and higher borrowing costs. Risks from the
sharp slowdown in Russia and the depreciation of the ruble are significant, given the links between
Russia and Armenia (Box 2). While EEU accession may bring benefits, the Armenian economy could
become even more closely tied to Russia, and the end of negotiations on an Association Agreement
with the EU could mean the loss of a long-term reform anchor and convergence to EU standards.
Renewed conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh remains a significant country-specific risk.
By contrast, upside developments could occur in the mining sector, where new copper and gold
production could lead to an increase in exports. There is also upside potential in tourism and
agriculture. Russia’s counter-sanctions against European food products could potentially benefit
Armenia’s agricultural sector, although it will be difficult to scale up quickly. The authorities
expressed concern regarding the impact of sanctions on Russia, including risk aversion by banks and
investors to the region as a whole, and not just to Russia/Ukraine.

FIRST REVIEW UNDER THE EXTENDED ARRANGEMENT
The Fund-supported program remains on track, with all end-June performance criteria
and most indicative targets met. The fiscal targets, however, were met in a context of
significant budget underexecution, and progress on structural reforms was mixed, partly
reflecting the government change. As conditions have been weaker than expected, the
program’s fiscal deficit projections for 2015 and 2016 are being eased to support
additional capital expenditures and GDP growth, although the fiscal path will still achieve
the debt-reducing fiscal deficit target of 1.8 percent of GDP by the end of the program
period. Projections for gross international reserves and the import-coverage ratio are also
being revised.

A. Fiscal Policy
14.
The program deficit targets were met by wide margins, but the social spending IT was
missed. A deficit of 0.5 percent of GDP (program definition) was recorded through June,
significantly below the 1.3 percent of GDP target, primarily due to lower capital expenditure and
lower matching pension contributions. Social spending was also below target, however, mainly
reflecting further targeting and a lower number of families receiving social assistance than planned.2
Tax revenues were just 0.2 percent of GDP below projections in the first half of the year, despite
slower growth and even as the government stepped up efforts to reduce the stock of advanced tax
payments and outstanding tax refunds. With a lower deficit, the government reduced the issuance
of domestic debt and maintained a comfortable level of deposits at the CBA. The deficit is expected

Other fiscal targets were met, including: (i) the continuous PCs on nonaccumulation of external arrears and on
nonabsorption of losses, liabilities, or payments of utilities and other companies; and (ii) the indicative targets on
government guarantees for external debt and the average concessionality of newly contracted external debt.

to widen in the second half, as the impact of higher wages and pensions kicks in and
implementation of capital spending accelerates. The deficit is expected to close the year at around
0.8 percent of GDP below the budget target of 2.3 percent of GDP.
15.
Fiscal reforms are advancing. The new government merged the MOF and SRC, which is
expected to improve synergies and reduce collection gaps. The SRC established a Risk Management
Unit (RMU), which is in the process of preparing a compliance strategy for 2015 (June and
December 2014 structural benchmarks), and the MOF is making progress in establishing a second
RMU with support from FAD TA to look into risks related to concessions, PPPs, utilities, and SOEs
(December 2014 structural benchmark). The authorities are advancing in their assessment of
possible new tax measures, including on high-wealth individuals (September 2014 and June 2015
structural benchmarks). New legislative amendments to the customs code were approved to
improve customs operations and trade (March 2014 structural benchmark). In the social spending
area, there has been progress in the establishment of integrated social service centers and an
increase in allowances under the Family Benefits Program (FBP).

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF
staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability
below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on
the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize
jointly.

16.
A higher fiscal deficit is proposed for 2015 to support growth. With lower growth,
meeting the envisaged 2.0 percent of GDP budget deficit would have led to a decline in capital
spending, exacerbating the slowdown. Staff and the authorities agreed to ease the deficit target by
0.3 percent of GDP in 2015 to increase investment outlays (e.g., roads, infrastructure). The authorities
will strengthen implementation of the foreign-financed capital budget by submitting monthly
progress reports on externally-funded projects to the Office of the Prime Minister and preparing
proposals on how to improve execution (April 2015 structural benchmark). They will also improve
the procurement system for domestically-funded projects by shifting fully to e-procurement for
both central and local governments in 2015. The program now foresees reaching the debt-reducing
deficit target of 1.8 percent of GDP in 2017 rather than in 2016.

Box 2. Spillovers from Global and Regional Developments to Armenia
Global Risks. Normalization of monetary policies in key advanced economies would likely not have a strong
direct impact, given the large share of concessional financing in Armenia’s external debt and low
international integration of the banking system. However, higher global interest rates would affect domestic
financing conditions and demand due to high dollarization. In addition, they could affect Armenia via Russia,
which is highly exposed to global financial conditions. A protracted slowdown in emerging markets could
depress prices for Armenia’s mineral and metal exports, nearly 50 percent of total exports. While
hydrocarbon prices would be lower, the price of gas from Russia is already low and fixed for four more years.
Risks from Russia. The conflict in Ukraine and sanctions have affected Russia through a cut-off of external
funding, lower investment, capital outflows, and higher policy and borrowing rates. These factors have
contributed to significant depreciation of the ruble, along with the decline of oil prices and increasing
concerns about medium-term growth. Armenia is closely integrated with Russia through a variety of
channels:


Trade. Russia accounts for around ¼ of Armenia’s exports of goods, concentrated in job-creating
sectors like agriculture, light industry, and transportation. Since 2008, the correlation of Russian GDP
growth and Armenian exports has strengthened.



Remittances. Armenia receives 18–20 percent of GDP in remittances, 90 percent from Russia, increasing
the potential adverse effects of ruble depreciation. Since 2009, remittance growth has outpaced GDP
growth, with deposits building up in the domestic banking system. A deep and protracted downturn in
Russia could cause migrant workers to return, putting pressure on the local job market.



Bank flows. Spillovers may be direct through Russian banks active in Armenia and indirect via
confidence effects. Two major Russian banks are active, although the Armenia operations of these banks
are very small compared to parent bank size. The exposure of Armenian banks to Russian assets or
Armenian firms operating in Russia is a source of credit risk, although this impact appears relatively
small and manageable at present. Indirect confidence effects may arise if banks in North America and
Europe limit their new operations in Armenia due to geopolitical developments.



Investment. Russia is an important source of FDI, especially government-related firms like Gazprom,
UES, Russian Railways, and mobile phone operators. FDI plans of these firms and other Russian investors
(e.g., Rosneft, RusHydro, mining companies, private firms) may be affected by a major slowdown. FDI
from other sources could also decline, if investors reassess economies perceived as closely linked to
Russia, although there could be more interest from investors from China, the Gulf, or if geopolitical
conditions change, Iran and Turkey.

Policy response. Adverse spillovers would strengthen depreciation pressure, with possible balance sheet
effects given high dollarization. The room for response is limited in the short term, but there may be space
for a moderate fiscal stimulus and monetary easing. Increased exchange rate flexibility is needed to reflect
changes in fundamentals, including the depreciation of the ruble. Accelerating reforms to increase growth
and diversify export destinations and products would also increase resilience in the longer term.

17.
Some targeted revenue measures will also contribute to supporting growth in 2015.
The government will begin gradually replacing the current mixed (accrual/cash) method for
determining VAT liability and providing credits/refunds within a unified regime where both debits
and credits are calculated on an accrual basis. This change will ease cash-flow constraints for
taxpayers and will be phased over three years, with estimated costs to the budget of AMD 5 billion
(0.1 percent of GDP) in the first year. Costs in the second and third years will be higher and

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

necessitate offsetting measures. In response to continuing weaknesses in construction, the
government will allow for income tax deductibility of mortgage payments under loans for purchase
of new apartments built after November 1, 2014. Tax incentives will also be provided to remote
border regions adjacent to Azerbaijan. To contain the impact on revenues from these changes, the
natural resource user fee for non-metallic minerals will be increased in 2015, and the government
will consider raising excise rates on alcohol and tobacco, if needed.
18.
Revenue measures, including strengthening of tax compliance, will be important in the
coming years to address gaps in the tax system and increase fiscal space and buffers. Revenue
measures in 2016 and beyond will be necessary to reduce the stock of advance tax payments (by
0.3 percent of GDP per year in 2016–17), increase capital and social expenditures, and bring the
deficit to 1.8 percent of GDP by the end of the program period and set debt on a declining path.
The government is initiating the preparation of a new tax code aimed at reforming the tax system
and reducing high compliance costs through a well-defined set of taxation principles and rights and
obligations of taxpayers and the tax administration, in line with best practices. Preparation and
enactment of the code will present an opportunity to eliminate tax expenditures, subject the
approval of new tax benefits to more stringent rules, and broaden the tax base (e.g., agriculture,
fuels). To support this work, the government included for the first time an annex to the 2015 budget
quantifying the main tax expenditures.
19.
EEU membership could have major fiscal implications. After joining the EEU, Armenia is
expected to receive 1.13 percent of the common customs pool, implying additional customs
revenues of about 1½ percent of GDP annually (net of the current level). As ratification of Armenia’s
membership in the EEU is still pending, these revenues are not yet incorporated in the 2015 budget
or in program targets. In light of Russia’s commitments to the WTO, the revenue increases will be
transitory, as EEU tariffs are expected to decline over the medium-term. Staff proposed that the
revenues mainly be saved to build fiscal reserves and until high-quality capital projects and social
spending can be identified (and capital underspending issues addressed). The authorities agreed,
also citing concerns with the initiation and sustainability of the revenues. Staff identified potential
downsides, including (i) the impact of sanctions and lower oil prices on Russia’s imports; (ii) the
medium-term forecasts of Russian custom revenues in light of Russia’s commitments for WTO
membership; (iii) possible delays due technical obstacles in implementing the customs pool
revenue-sharing mechanism; (iv) the impact of seasonal import patterns on cash management; (v)
possible legal provisions that could provide special exemptions and loopholes for member
countries; and (vi) negotiations that may be needed with other WTO countries, as Armenia needs to
raise tariffs above its WTO commitments. If ratification is achieved and membership commences
from January, the Second Review (March 2015) will provide an early opportunity for assessment.
20.
The authorities are continuing with implementation of the flagship pension reform,
although its scope has been narrowed for now. The reform targets key economic and social
objectives, including addressing Armenia’s unfavorable population dynamics and old-age poverty
and the lack of long-term funding in local currency. However, the reform was received with mistrust
from some segments of the population, especially young high-wage workers, who led protests.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

Following a decision in April by the Constitutional Court to strike down some provisions of the
pension law, the government made changes to the reform (Annex II). These have necessitated
adjustments to procedures, software, websites, and financial and information flows, which in turn
have delayed full roll-out. As these adjustments are being made, the government’s efforts are now
targeted at increasing public awareness of the reform. The temporary narrowing of coverage of the
reform will likely result in fiscal savings of up to 0.3 percent of GDP per year through 2017 because
of lower government payments for matching contributions.

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
21.
Program NIR and NDA targets were met, but the inflation indicative target was
missed as inflation fell below the CBA’s target range. The June NIR target was met, as the CBA
was able to partially recoup the intervention undertaken early in the year and as imports weakened
in the context of lower budget execution. The NDA target was met by a comfortable margin, even
though the CBA further eased monetary policy. The CBA oversaw a decline in overnight rates
without a large increase in credit to banks, due to weaker economic conditions, relatively strong
growth in dram deposits, and lower budget execution. Preliminary data indicate that the September
NIR and NDA indicative targets were also met. On the other hand, and in spite of the monetary
easing since late 2013, the inflation indicative target was missed as a decline in both food and
nonfood inflation led to end-June inflation falling below the 4 ± 1.5 target range. With inflation
expected to return to the target range within the next few months, staff and the authorities agreed
that a continuation of the current stance appears warranted, although an adjustment may be
necessitated by changes in the transmission of monetary policy to market rates, developments in
key trading partners, and monetary policy changes in advanced economies.
22.
Monetary policy remains anchored on the CBA’s inflation-forecast targeting (IFT)
framework. In the near term, the IFT regime will continue to be complemented by a ceiling on NDA
of the CBA, as the program transitions to inflation-consultation clauses. The CBA is further
strengthening modeling and communications, both with Fund TA, and the monetary operations
toolkit, particularly the use of one- and seven-day instruments for interbank lending. The CBA is
assessing obstacles to developing the FX derivatives market and hedging instruments and will
formulate a policy agenda.
23.
Exchange rate policy will complement the IFT regime and support external adjustment.
Staff and the authorities agreed that exchange rate policy should continue to be guided by letting
the exchange rate to be determined by market developments, with occasional intervention to
mitigate disorderly conditions, and where possible, to build buffers. As a result, policies may deviate
from a pure float, but interventions are expected to be targeted and infrequent. In this respect, the
recent depreciation of the Russian ruble poses a challenge with a need to balance limited
intervention to mitigate disorderly conditions with exchange rate movements that reflect changes in
fundamentals. Clear communications will be important to support these efforts. The staff noted that
exchange rate policy may become more challenging as integration with the EEU advances,

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

particularly if more transactions are settled in rubles, and suggested to step up monitoring of these
changes in the context of future program reviews.
24.
The Fund-supported program envisages new measures to strengthen the
independence and operations of the CBA, in line with the most recent IMF Safeguards
Assessment completed in August. During 2014–15, the CBA will work with its external auditors to
present a consolidated financial position inclusive of enterprises owned by the CBA and will publish
an annex in its annual report describing these investments, their rationale, objectives, development
strategy, risks, risk-mitigation efforts, and where appropriate, the CBA’s divestment strategy
(June 2015 structural benchmark). The CBA will improve the charter for its board to better outline
the roles and responsibilities of board members. Finally, the CBA and the government will work to
advance long-pending legislation to require the government to issue marketable, interest-bearing
securities to cover CBA losses.

C. Financial Sector Policy
25.
The banking sector remains sound, but close monitoring is warranted given the
weaker economic environment. Capital and liquidity ratios remain well above minimum regulatory
requirements, and banks have increased provisions in response to higher NPLs, keeping the
provisions-to-NPLs ratio at over 40 percent. Furthermore, while the system’s net foreign assets are
negative, liabilities mainly represent financing from parent banks and IFIs, relatively stable sources of
financing. Nonetheless, close monitoring is warranted given that a further weakening of economic
conditions could drive NPLs higher while sanctions against Russia could affect the sector. The
authorities agreed, noting that sanctions had indeed adversely impacted local affiliates of Russian
banks, although the effects were so far manageable. The authorities also noted that the high level of
FX liquidity in the system should help mitigate the impact of additional adverse external pressures.
26.
All financial sector structural benchmarks—covering supervision, regulation, and
development—were met. The CBA has continued to make progress in adjusting its supervisory and
regulatory framework to new Basel III guidance, which targets banking sector improvements in
absorbing shocks, risk management and governance, and transparency and disclosures. Recent
progress has focused on capital requirements, where a new regulation was passed, and on
assessment of systemically important domestic institutions, where a new identification methodology
was elaborated (June 2014 structural benchmark). The CBA has made progress in other financial
sector reforms. Following FSAP recommendations, draft amendments to the legislation of the
Deposit Guarantee Fund (DGF) were submitted to parliament to shorten the pay-out period
(September 2014 structural benchmark). The authorities also submitted to parliament legislation to
facilitate foreign investor participation in securities markets (September 2014 structural benchmark).
27.
Further reforms to strengthen and develop the financial sector are envisaged under
the program. First, building on the findings of a policy paper on registration and execution of
collateral (June 2014 structural benchmark), the program envisages preparation of legislation aimed
at removing obstacles (September 2015 structural benchmark). Second, the CBA will continue to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

align its regulatory and supervisory framework with Basel III guidance, particularly regarding liquidity
requirements and large exposures (see program issues section below). Finally, the program will aim
at strengthening the CBA’s dedollarization framework, although the exact measures are still to be
specified (see Article IV discussion below).

D. Structural Issues
28.
Progress on structural issues has been mixed. The “open skies” framework—allowing for
easier entry into the civil aviation market—is in place and delivering increased flights at lower costs
(April 2014 structural benchmark), and preparatory work for overhauling bankruptcy processes is in
motion. However, three structural benchmarks—on competition, inspection, and regulatory
reforms—did not advance as expected. This reflects the government change and changes in senior
officials at key ministries and agencies rather than differences of views or changes in commitments.
The draft inspection law was submitted to parliament in October (March 2014 structural benchmark).
The authorities expect to submit a packet for streamlining regulations by March 2015 (June 2014
structural benchmark).
29.
Further reforms agreed during discussions will aim at improving the business
environment. The program envisages: (i) completion of the last phase of the Regulatory Guillotine
program in order to lighten the regulatory burden on the private sector, and introduction of impact
assessments for new regulations; (ii) strengthening reporting by companies to level the playing field
and reduce the shadow economy; (iii) simplifying bankruptcy procedures in order to improve
financial intermediation (June 2015 structural benchmark); (iv) further reforms in the energy sector
to increase the efficiency and sustainability of the sector; and (v) strengthening institutional
administration within the government, particularly regarding accounting and reporting
(December 2014 structural benchmark). These reforms will help address critical weaknesses in
Armenia’s business environment and, as a result, support growth.

E. Program Issues
30.
EU financing is now unlikely and has been removed from the program’s
macroeconomic framework. The Fund-supported program incorporated EU macro-financial
assistance (MFA) of $100 million in 2014–15, based on consultations with the European Commission
(EC). However, in June, the EC informed the authorities that it would not pursue preparation of the
MFA, as it considered Armenia’s financing needs to be moderate, rather than substantial, and
conditions to be stable, rather than acute. The EC indicated that it would continue to monitor
developments and stand ready to reconsider, if conditions deteriorate sharply. Accordingly, the EU
financing has been removed from the program’s macroeconomic framework. The projected path of
CBA reserves is now lower than at the time of program approval, but reserves remain well above
standard import and debt metrics. The program is fully financed going forward, with firm financing
commitments.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

31.
Staff and the authorities propose to drop two existing structural benchmarks. The
December 2014 benchmark on amendments to the large exposures regulation was based on
guidance that has been superseded. CBA regulations are already broadly in line with new Basel III
guidance in most areas, and the central bank is assessing whether modifications are needed. The
authorities also propose to drop a June 2014 benchmark that calls for memoranda of understanding
between the State Revenue Committee and the Competition Commission (among other agencies)
on information exchange, as they consider that an existing decree provides sufficient basis for
enhanced collaboration.

ARTICLE IV DISCUSSIONS: REDUCING VULNERABILITIES
AND INCREASING POTENTIAL GROWTH
With recovery from the 2009 crisis established, Armenia faces a period of moderate
medium-term growth, as sluggish investment in recent years, the absence of strong
growth drivers, and a still-weak business climate constrain the capacity of the economy
to generate sufficient jobs to stem emigration and reduce poverty. EEU membership could
boost Armenia’s traditional exports, but also increase links to Russia, which faces high
geopolitical risks and weak medium-term growth prospects. Discussions focused on more
decisive implementation of reforms, as anchored in the Fund-supported program, to
reduce vulnerabilities and boost potential growth.

A. Reducing vulnerabilities
32.
Reducing vulnerabilities remains a priority. The external current account deficit is
expected to gradually decline from 8.0 percent of GDP in 2013 to 6½ percent of GDP over the
medium term. Armenia’s international reserve levels are adequate and meet international
benchmark levels (Annex III). However, the trade deficit remains large, underscoring the need for
enhanced competitiveness and additional exchange rate flexibility. While the public debt DSA
suggests that public debt sustainability is not a major source of concern, external debt remains high
at 82 percent of GDP at end-2013 and is sensitive to shocks (Annexes III and IV). In addition, the
financial sector is highly dollarized.
33.
The authorities are implementing a prudent macro-policy mix that aims to reduce
vulnerabilities. Efforts aim at: achieving fiscal consolidation, while creating space for social and
investment needs; allowing for more exchange rate flexibility and improving competitiveness
through structural reforms; accumulating adequate levels of external reserves, reducing public debt,
and increasing fiscal buffers; and fostering dedollarization.

spending multipliers provide support for fully executing a
well-designed and targeted public investment program (Selected Issues Paper). In addition, there is
scope to improve the tax system and increase revenues by broadening the tax base.
Authorities’ views
35.
While the authorities agreed on the need to increase capital spending in a sustainable
manner, they were concerned about the impact of higher tax revenues on growth and the
business environment. The authorities agreed with staff on the importance of reducing capital
under-execution and will prepare an analysis of under-execution and specific proposals to accelerate
capital spending. They remain committed in principle to increasing revenues starting in 2016 to
create fiscal space for priority social and investment spending, but they would like to limit the
impact on the business environment and growth. In this respect, they stated that government
support for the agricultural sector is significantly lower than in EU countries and that recent tax
expenditure measures are limited in scope. Staff noted that additional EEU custom revenues of
about 1½ percent of GDP per year could make a major difference supporting the build-up of a
strong fiscal buffer, particularly in advance of debt repayment in 2020. The authorities noted that
these revenues should be first secured and their sustainability assessed, along with the impact of
higher EEU customs tariffs. Both sides agreed that the potentially higher revenues should not reduce
the urgency for fiscal reforms.

Exchange Rate and International Reserves
36.
A greater commitment to exchange rate flexibility will help facilitate external
adjustment and enhance resilience to shocks. The CBA has become more active in the foreign
exchange market, selling dollars when the dram has faced depreciation pressures, and purchasing

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

FX to stem the appreciation pressures.3 Partly as a result of these interventions, the dram has
experienced less volatility since mid-2013. However, the dram appreciated in real effective terms by
close to 6 percent in 2013 and by a further 2 percent from end-2013 through August 2014. With
thedepreciation of the Russian ruble against the dram between end-August to end-November, the
real effective exchange rate appreciated further in that period. Staff estimates suggest the need for
an adjustment of the dram in real terms over the medium term to bring the external current account
balance to equilibrium levels (Annex V).4 International reserves remain adequate based on standard
import and debt metrics, as well as the IMF’s composite metric. Reserves adequacy is also favorable
in comparison with peer group countries (Annex III).
Authorities’ views
37.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to exchange rate flexibility, but
questioned the robustness of staff‘s estimate of the valuation of the exchange rate. They
pointed to the significant narrowing of the external current account deficit since 2012 as evidence
that the dram may not be overvalued. Staff underscored that the recent improvement of the current
account reflects to some extent developments in partner countries (higher earnings of Armenians
living abroad), while the trade balance improved only marginally. The authorities placed less
emphasis on the role of exchange rate adjustment and more on structural measures to improve
competitiveness. Staff agreed that structural reforms to improve competitiveness would
complement additional flexibility of the dram.

Financial Dollarization
38.
Armenia’s dedollarization strategy is broad and comprehensive, but progress has been
slow, and there may be room for introducing additional measures. After spiking to over
70 percent in 2009 during the crisis, financial dollarization has remained at around 60 percent of
total deposits and private sector credit in spite of a broad set of dedollarization measures. These
have included macroeconomic stabilization (primarily fiscal consolidation) and micro-prudential and
supervisory measures. The persistence of high dollarization is consistent with international
experience, which suggests that dollarization is difficult to overcome. Staff noted that some
dedollarization policies may have had the unintended consequence of increasing credit
dollarization, at least temporarily, and argued that there is scope for deepening the dedollarization
agenda, particularly through policies that help reduce external imbalances and increase FX liquidity
requirements for bank borrowing and lending (Selected Issues Paper).

3

Following a sequence of interventions in the foreign exchange market by the CBA in 2013, the de-facto exchange
rate arrangement was reclassified from “floating” to “crawl-like” in March 2014.
4

Staff estimates were calculated based on end-September data for the real effective exchange rates.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

Authorities’ views
39.
The authorities were less enthusiastic regarding the scope for additional
dedollarization measures, and were concerned with impact on financial intermediation. They
argued that while further reforms could reduce dollarization, the impact of measures introduced in
the past few years had been modest. The current strategy relies on high reserve requirements on FX
deposits, held in dram, which staff observed may hinder intermediation and growth. Staff noted that
dedollarization policies involve a trade-off with disintermediation, with some tradeoff justified by
reduced vulnerabilities. The authorities and staff agreed to work on modifications to the
dedollarization strategy. The CBA will prepare a policy paper assessing liquidity and reserve
requirement regulations, including their levels and currency of denomination, impacts on interest
rates, bank liquidity and buffers, and dollarization, compliance with new Basel III recommendations,
and the scope for change (new March 2015 structural benchmark).

B. Increasing Potential Growth and Inclusiveness
40.
Increasing potential growth is crucial for Armenia becoming a dynamic emerging
market economy. Trend growth has averaged about 4.5 percent since 2010, but growth has been
volatile, largely reflecting external developments, commodity price movements, and weather
conditions. Staff and the authorities agreed that higher growth rates are necessary to further reduce
poverty and inequality and discussed key constraints to
growth (Box 3).
Poverty and Inequality

Under the current baseline growth scenario, staff
estimates that only 10 thousand jobs will be created per

More efforts are needed to support job creation.
Declines in unemployment and poverty since the 2009 crisis
seem to mask long-term, underlying weaknesses in the labor
market. The economy does not generate enough jobs to stem
emigration, and without decisive policies to improve labor
market conditions, the quality of education, and the business
environment, Armenia will continue to export labor and rely
on remittances to sustain consumption (Figure 1).

training are often cited as structural problems that
contribute to skills mismatches. Since 2006, Armenia has dropped from the first to third quartile
in the WEF Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) for labor market efficiency. Similarly, Armenia
ranks 120 out of 144 countries for availability of research and training services. There is a large
degree of informality in labor markets, with roughly half of Armenians reportedly having jobs
without formal contracts.

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

Box 3. Constraints to Potential Growth
Since 2009, growth has returned to Armenia, but growth rates have been generally moderate and
volatile. The authorities consider that growth could be higher—in the range of 6–7 percent underpinned by
higher industrial and agriculture exports, IT services, and tourism. However, staff estimates suggest that
potential growth over the medium term is about 4½ percent. There are several underlying constraints to
potential growth:


Armenia has not developed an alternative to the pre-2009 construction-led growth model. While
growth prior to 2009 was driven by construction, post-crisis trend growth has been driven by
agriculture, services, and mining. These sectors are held back by a relatively weak business environment.
In 2013, Armenia fell 6 places in the WEF’s GCI ratings.



Low private and public investment is having a negative impact on potential growth. Investment
declined from close to 30 percent of GDP in 2010 to about 22 percent in 2013, partly reflecting much
lower construction. FDI has also been low since the 2009 crisis, due in part to conclusion of major
privatization transactions, and is lower than in neighboring countries. Public investment has halved
since 2010, and is below the regional median level. The World Bank estimates that investment of close
to 30 percent of GDP is needed to support growth of 6–7 percent per year.



Outmigration and skills shortages constrain the contribution of human capital to medium-term
growth. Businesses have cited obstacles in expanding and improving competitiveness, due to skilled
emigration and skills shortages.



Diminishing growth prospects in Russia will have an impact. Armenia is closely linked to Russia via
trade, remittances, financial, and investment channels, and growth in Russia is expected to remain
restrained over the medium term. Still, Armenia’s exports to Russia are small relative to size of the
Russian economy (0.02 percent), so there is scope for growth through increased market penetration.

To increase competitiveness, the authorities need to strengthen the business
environment, foster domestic competition, and increase trade and financial integration.
The 2013–25 Armenian Development Strategy (ADS) proposes a coherent growth strategy based on
agriculture, IT, tourism, and industrial exports.
Global Competitiveness Index, 2014
But implementation of structural reforms has
(Score)
been uneven in recent years. This is reflected, for

example, in Armenia’s ranking in the WEF GCI,
which lags relative to regional comparators and

has not seen much improvement since its
inception in 2006. In 2014, the “open skies”

inspections and cut unnecessary regulation have
experienced delays. According to the World
Source: World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Report.
Bank, the current domestic market structure is
characterized by excessive concentration, vertical integration, and ownership links. The authorities
should step up efforts to limit anti-competitive behavior and foster a level playing field. Higher
customs tariffs associated with EEU accession could pose risks in this area.
43.
Staff urged the authorities to make a concerted effort to ensure the pension reform’s
success. Staff and the authorities agreed that the pension reform was well designed and in line with
international best practice. The reform will help address demographic trends, reduce old-age
poverty, and provide a boost to capital market development by providing a pool of long-term
savings to catalyze investment and growth. Staff expressed concerns that the phased, gradual
implementation approach could lead to pressures to further delay or modify the reforms in three
years—coinciding with the parliamentary and presidential elections cycle—and urged the authorities
to overcome recent obstacles and ensure smooth implementation.
Authorities’ views
44.
The authorities emphasized that higher growth rates are achievable. They argued that
steady implementation of the ADS and potential investments in mining, industry, transportation,
agriculture, and services will help achieve strong growth rates. They pointed out that Armenia has
experienced lower growth rates since the 2009 because of a combination of structural changes in
the economy (less reliance on construction as the main growth driver) and cyclical factors in trading
partners. While recognizing that FDI levels have been low in recent years, the authorities were
confident that the EEU will catalyze new greenfield investments, including from foreign investors
who see Armenia as a favorable platform for activities in Russia. In the authorities’ view, lack of

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

domestic competition is not a substantial impediment to growth, but rather reflects Armenia’s small
market size, closed borders, and high transportation costs, especially rail costs across Georgia. On
pension reform, the authorities expressed their commitment to the reform’s success and confidence
that the gradual implementation approach will help overcome short-term obstacles and public
mistrust.

Trade Integration
45.
EEU accession could provide a boost to Armenia’s economy, although efforts are
needed to ensure a smooth transition. Accession is expected to provide enhanced access to the
Russian market, as well as to Belarus and Kazakhstan, and the potential to increase exports
substantially. The large number of exemptions to the EEU common external tariff during the eightyear transition period will reduce trade diversion. The enhanced status of Armenian workers in
Russia is expected to ease risks of legal changes that could undermine remittances. The 2013 gas
agreement has helped secure stable import prices through 2018. However, the authorities will need
to put in place implementing regulations and modify legislation to complete entry to the EEU. As
Armenia does not share a common border with any EEU member, the authorities will need to ensure
a favorable transit regime with Georgia to benefit from the customs union, and Armenia’s
geographic location and high transport costs will continue to constrain exports.
46.
Further trade integration beyond the EEU, most notably with the EU, could bolster
growth and reduce vulnerabilities. The authorities are continuing efforts to improve ties with the
broader regional and global economy, and they are discussing a framework for enhanced
cooperation with the EU.
Authorities’ views
47.
The authorities are optimistic about the impact of the EEU on the Armenian economy.
They underscored that the agricultural sector stands to gain from more secure access to the Russian
market, and highlighted that Armenia offers an attractive platform for foreign investors seeking a
foothold in the EEU. The authorities emphasized that the EEU membership will not end Armenia’s
push for more trade integration with the rest of the world. In particular, they highlighted their
objective of continued strong cooperation with the EU.

Energy Sector
48.
An integrated energy strategy is needed that is compatible with long-term fiscal
sustainability, maximizes the role of the private sector, ensures transparency, and protects the
poor. Enjoying few natural resources, Armenia has developed an energy sector that balances
consumption of gas from Russia, aging nuclear and hydro facilities, and a gas-for-electricity barter
deal with Iran. Going forward, there are several critical long-term issues that need to be addressed:


Securing gas supply at affordable prices. Last year’s agreement on a five-year gas supply
arrangement with Russia avoided a major price increase, but continued a series of debt-equity
swaps. The gas network and other energy assets have now been fully transferred. The authorities
need to be prepared for the end of the agreement in 2018 and possible price adjustments.



Extending the life of the Metsamor nuclear reactor, and securing power generation
capacity once Metsamor’s life expires. Metsamor provides about 25 percent of Armenia’s
electric power. The reactor needs work to extend its life for another 10 years at a cost of up to
3 percent of GDP, for which the authorities have secured concessional financing from Russia.
Construction of a new reactor would cost 50 percent of GDP, and staff urged the authorities to
work with the World Bank to consider new generation capacity in a least cost planning
framework, compatible with debt sustainability, and involving the private sector to reduce risks.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA



Ensuring fiscal sustainability and transparency of the power sector, while protecting the
poor. Low tariffs have contributed to short-term debts and limited maintenance and investment.
To strengthen financial viability, the authorities raised tariffs by 10 percent in July, which affected
the poor. A World Bank study shows that the poor are particularly vulnerable to tariff hikes and
suggests mitigating impacts through the Family Benefits Program.

Authorities’ views
49.
A key priority of the authorities is to achieve greater energy security. While
underscoring their commitment to private sector-led investment and least cost planning, they
expressed concern on greater reliance on imported natural gas and interest in building a new
nuclear power plant, if financing can be arranged. With the help of the World Bank, the authorities
are preparing a strategy to lay out the long-term structure of energy sector, including the
generation mix, tariff alignment, and protection of the poor (December 2014 structural benchmark).
The authorities agreed on the need for transparency of operations in the energy sector, including
asset sales.

STAFF APPRAISAL
50.
Armenia faces a period of slower growth unless decisive actions are taken. Sound
macroeconomic policies since the crisis have helped sustain domestic and external stability in a
highly uncertain context. However, going forward, projected growth rates will not be sufficient to
generate sufficient jobs and stem emigration. Sluggish investment in recent years, a still-weak
business climate, and the absence of strong growth drivers constrain the capacity of the economy to
generate sufficient jobs to stem emigration and reduce poverty. EEU membership could help
increase exports to the large EEU market, but medium-term growth prospects for Russia are modest
as well. Therefore, more decisive implementation of reforms, as anchored in the Fund-supported
program, is needed to reduce vulnerabilities and boost potential growth.
51.
Performance has moderated due to both domestic and regional factors. Growth is
expected to slow to 2.6 percent of GDP in 2014 from 3.5 percent in 2013, while inflation has fallen
below the CBA’s target range. Growth of exports and remittances has weakened, but slower growth
of imports meant that the FX market remained relatively stable through much of 2014, although
pressures emerged in November-December. The banking sector remains well capitalized and liquid,
but weakening conditions have been associated with an increase in NPLs. On a brighter note, while
the slowdown has been broadly based, agriculture and tourism are benefitting from investment and
structural reforms and are growing at a healthy pace.
52.
Vulnerabilities remain high. While international reserves are adequate, the consolidation of
the external current account deficit has slowed in 2014 due to lower-than-expected exports and
remittances. Staff estimates that an adjustment of the real exchange rate over the medium term
would help facilitate further external adjustment and improve competitiveness. However, the

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

banking system is still highly dollarized, which could imply pressures on bank balance sheets if a
disorderly external adjustment occurs.
53.
Armenia faces a high degree of risk. Growth is projected to pick up to 3.3 percent of GDP
in 2015, in the context of supportive macroeconomic policies—notably, monetary policy easing
in 2013–14 and stronger capital budget execution. However, the short-term outlook is subject to a
high degree of uncertainty, especially given regional geopolitical developments and tensions. An
intensification of these would lead to further negative spillovers to Armenia’s economy.
54.
The authorities should create fiscal space to boost social and investment spending
over the medium term. Efforts should focus on revenues, as underexecution of capital spending
has had a negative impact on growth, although staff commends the authorities for not diverting
spending into low pay-off areas and welcomes efforts to assess and address reasons for
underspending. With lower growth, available financing, and few risks to inflation or sustainability,
staff sees merit in a higher deficit in the 2015 budget, with increased spending going to capital
outlays. Staff has long pressed for higher tax revenues to support higher social spending and
growth-enhancing infrastructure projects. Tax measures should also aim to improve the tax system
by eliminating gaps and ensuring greater equity. The upcoming formulation of a comprehensive tax
code is an opportunity to broaden the tax base and rationalize exemptions and tax expenditures.
EEU common customs pool revenues could provide a further opportunity to build fiscal buffers
through savings. However, the revenues must be secured and in any event are transitory, as EEU
tariffs are expected to decline over the medium-term. Staff commends the authorities’ cautious
approach in evaluating the sustainability of these additional revenues, prior to incorporating them in
the budget framework.
55.
Further strengthening of monetary and financial sector policies should remain a
priority, building on recent progress. The CBA’s IFT framework has served Armenia well and
remains an appropriate anchor for monetary policy. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of the IFT
framework should be further strengthened by reducing dollarization, improving monetary policy
instruments, and enhancing the CBA’s communication and modeling capabilities. Similarly, the CBA
has made noteworthy progress in implementing FSAP recommendations and Basel III guidance,
while strengthening financial sector regulation and resilience. However, further work is needed to
incorporate new guidance on large exposures and liquidity requirements, as well as to revisit the
dedollarization strategy, and to foster better financial intermediation via improved legislation on
registration and execution of collateral.
56.
Exchange rate policy should support external adjustment. The current situation poses
challenges to exchange rate policy, notably the recent depreciation of the Russian ruble, uncertainty
surrounding regional geopolitical events, and pressures to calm what are perceived as disorderly
conditions in a thin market. While limited interventions to mitigate disorderly conditions are
warranted, pressures that reflect economic fundamentals should be accommodated. Enhanced
central bank communications will be important to provide clarity and guidance. Maintaining robust
buffers, together with flexibility of the dram, should support further reduction of the external current
account deficit to its sustainable level.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

57.
The authorities should implement ambitious reforms to bolster potential growth and
promote inclusion. The successful implementation of “open skies” in civil aviation is a good
example of how bold policy decisions can have positive results in a relatively short period of time.
Recent delays in implementation of reforms in the competition and regulatory areas, while relatively
minor, should be reversed. The reform agenda should be implemented decisively to improve
Armenia’s capacity to grow, create jobs, and reduce poverty. Business environment reforms should
overcome long-standing concerns about uneven competition, unnecessary regulation, high costs,
and skills shortages and mismatches. The authorities should move quickly to bolster the pension
reform and ensure its long-run success. Reforms in the energy sector should be compatible with
long-term fiscal sustainability, involve the private sector, and be transparent and cost-effective, while
mitigating the impact on the poor. Finally, the authorities should leverage EEU membership to
increase exports, improve standards, enhance domestic competition, and invest in infrastructure.
They should also pursue deeper integration beyond the EEU to enhance growth prospects and
reduce vulnerabilities.
58.
Policies under the program remain on track. All PCs and most ITs were met. Competition
and regulatory reforms have advanced at a slower-than-expected pace, causing delays in meeting
structural benchmarks, mainly due to the government change in mid-2014 rather than a change in
policy direction. Going forward, the program will accommodate a modest fiscal stimulus in 2015,
while maintaining macroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability. The NIR targets will help
maintain strong buffers. Structural benchmarks for the remainder of 2014 and first half of 2015 are
focused on core areas, including tax administration, PFM, financial sector development, and central
bank operations.
59.
Risks to the program are significant, but manageable, and Armenia’s repayment
capacity remains robust. While the short-term outlook is subject to a high degree of uncertainty,
and Armenia is vulnerable to geopolitical developments, the authorities have a strong track record
of sound macroeconomic policies and program implementation. A low fiscal deficit, moderate public
debt, broadly adequate reserves, and growth-supporting reforms embedded in the program
reinforce this assessment. Staff supports the authorities’ request for the equivalent of
SDR 11.74 million to become available with the completion of the First Review.
60.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV Consultations be concluded in accordance with
the September 28, 2010 Decision on Article IV Consultation Cycles

Sources: Armenian authorities; and Fund staff estimates and projections.
1/ From 2014 on, imports of gas are calculated at the (lower) price of $189 per thousand cubic meter. In addition to reducing
projected gas imports in 2014, this change also implies lower FDI (lower intercompany lending between parent and subsidiary)
2/ In 2013, a credit for $155 million is registered in FDI to reflect the acquisition by Gazprom of 20 percent of the shares of ArmRusGazprom,
while an offseting debit is registered in other capital (net) to reflect the corresponding reduction in liabilities of the latter with the former.
3/ Prospective EU financing. The authorities had requested about $100 million in Macro Financial Assistance from the EU.

Sources: Ministry of Finance, Central Bank of Armenia, and Fund staff estimates and projections.
1/ From 2014, social contributions include contributions to the second pillar of the pension system.
2/ Composition of expense reclassified in November 2013 to account for wage bill more accurately.
3/ In 2013 includes AMD 63 billion related to the acquisition by Gazprom from the government of 20 percent of the shares of ArmRusGazprom (gross inflow), and the transfer (other expenditure)
of the same amount from the government to ArmRusGazprom to liquidate liabilities. Excluding this transaction, the deficit would amount to AMD 43.6 billion, or 1 percent of GDP.
4/ Discrepancy between the fiscal and monetary accounts in 2009Q3-Q4, 2010, and 2011 is explained by government lending to the economy through commercial banks.
5/ Includes IMF budget support.
6/ Prospective EU financing. The authorities have requested about $100 million in Macro Financial Assistance from the EU.
7/ The program balance is measured as below-the-line overall balance minus net lending, except from 2010 to 2011Q1, where project financing is also subtracted.
8/ Sum of overall balance (above-the-line) and external net lending. In 2013, it excludes the transfer associated to the acquisition of ArmRusGazprom by Gazprom,
since it was financed with the sale of the government's shares in the company.

1/ From 2014, social contributions include contributions to the second pillar of the pension system.
2/ Composition of expense reclassified in November 2013 to account for wage bill more accurately.
3/ In 2013 includes AMD 63 billion related to the acquisition by Gazprom from the government of 20 percent of the shares of ArmRusGazprom (gross inflow), and the transfer (other expenditure)
of the same amount from the government to ArmRusGazprom to liquidate liabilities. Excluding this transaction, the deficit would amount to AMD 43.6 billion, or 1 percent of GDP.
4/ Discrepancy between the fiscal and monetary accounts in 2009Q3-Q4, 2010, and 2011 is explained by government lending to the economy through commercial banks.
5/ Includes IMF budget support.
6/ Prospective EU financing. The authorities have requested about $100 million in Macro Financial Assistance from the EU.
7/ The program balance is measured as below-the-line overall balance minus net lending, except from 2010 to 2011Q1, where project financing is also subtracted.
8/ Sum of overall balance (above-the-line) and external net lending. In 2013, it excludes the transfer associated to the acquisition of ArmRusGazprom by Gazprom,
since it was financed with the sale of the government's shares in the company.

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

Appendix I. Letter of Intent
Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431

Yerevan, December 3, 2014

Dear Madam Lagarde:
1.
Armenia’s economic performance has weakened in 2014 in the context of adverse
regional and global developments. Growth has decelerated by approximately 1 percentage point,
as the slowdown in Russia and still sluggish growth in the European Union (EU) have translated into
subpar growth of exports and of remittances. Inflation has also decelerated and is expected to close
the year well near the bottom of Central Bank of Armenia’s (CBA) target range (4 ± 1.5 percent).
Pressures on regional currencies early in 2014 also affected the dram and CBA reserves. Banking
sector profitability has declined, as credit growth has slowed, while nonperforming loans have
increased. The sector remains well capitalized; however, and deposit growth has remained strong.
The fiscal deficit will again be lower than budgeted, as capital underspending has continued,
particularly on complex, externally financed projects. The consolidation of the external current
account deficit will slow this year with lower growth of exports and remittances.
2.
Growth is expected to recover somewhat in 2015, but a deepening of the slowdown in
Armenia’s largest trading partners—Russia and the EU—are downside risks. Domestic policies
should support a moderate pick-up of growth and inflation. The outlook is subject to a high degree
of uncertainty, however, as an intensification of regional and global geopolitical tensions could
cause negative spillovers on Armenia’s economy, particularly if Russia and Europe are strongly
affected.
3.
Our program, supported by the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement with the IMF
is broadly on track. All continuous and quantitative performance criteria (PCs) and most indicative
targets (ITs) for end-June and end-September 2014 were met. There has been also significant
progress implementing the program’s structural benchmarks (SBs), although overall progress has
been uneven. On the positive side, financial sector reforms are advancing, the “open skies”
framework for civil aviation is in place and delivering increased flights at lower costs, and
preparatory work for overhauling bankruptcy processes is in motion. However, competition and
regulatory reforms have advanced at a slower pace, in part reflecting personnel changes with the
new government, which came into office in May. This letter of intent (LOI) describes policies for the
remainder of 2014 and the first half of 2015.

A. The Program for 2014–15
4.
Our economic policy objectives remain focused on sustaining macroeconomic stability
and establishing the basis for strong, inclusive growth. For the short term, our focus remains on
consolidating stability and maintaining strong buffers against possible external shocks. We are also
supporting growth through far-reaching reforms that aim to further Armenia’s transition towards a
dynamic emerging market economy: greater openness and domestic competition, an improved
business environment, and enhanced competitiveness and regional integration. We are conscious
that poverty alleviation remains a critical objective, and we are confident that our reform efforts will
foster sustainable and inclusive growth in the medium-term. In this context, we are continuing to
strengthen our well-targeted social programs to support the most vulnerable segments of the
population, while at the same time creating room in the state budget to address key social and
investment needs.

B. Fiscal Policy
5.
We continue to implement prudent fiscal policy. We expect the budget deficit in 2014 to
be around 1½ percent of GDP, 0.8 percent less than budgeted. Against the background of
deteriorating external environment and slowing down of economic activity, revenue will likely be
somewhat lower than planned. However, the revenue shortfall will be more than offset by
underexecution of capital spending, due largely to delays in implementation of large foreignfinanced projects. Changes in the design of the pension reforms, following a March Constitutional
Court ruling have also contributed to the lower expenditure outturn via lower coverage of the new
pension system than initially envisaged in the budget and lower government matching
contributions.
6.
The 2015 budget reflects our commitment to the objectives of the program. Fiscal
policy aims at supporting economic activity next year by providing a positive impulse. The overall
budget deficit will increase relative to the projected outcome for 2014 by 0.8 percent of GDP to
2.3 percent. This expansionary stance is warranted given that expected GDP growth is well below
potential, inflationary pressures are low, and public debt levels are moderate. We will continue
efforts to reduce the stock of tax credits or prepayments so as to achieve a reduction in the amount
of 0.3 percentage points of GDP in 2015. In addition, uncertainty continues to weigh on the outlook,
posing downside risks for revenue, whereas legally-mandated spending limits the scope for
reducing current outlays. Nonetheless, consistent with the goals of the program, we will make
provisions for capital expenditures with the aim of at least maintaining the level of investment
spending expected in 2014, 2.2 percent of GDP. A program adjustor will allow for additional foreignfinanced capital spending during the year, if project implementation proceeds faster than expected.
In the medium term, as growth picks up and the output gap closes, we will undertake gradual fiscal
consolidation, and we remain determined to reduce the fiscal deficit below the debt stabilizing level
of 2 percent of GDP. We recognize that legally-mandated current expenditures and interest outlays
may crowd out capital spending and additional spending in areas such as health and education,
unless revenues are increased.

7.
Armenia membership in the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) is expected to lead to
additional customs revenues. After joining the EEU, Armenia will receive 1.13 percent of the
common customs pool, currently estimated at about $23–25 billion annually. This will imply
additional customs revenue of about 1½ percent of GDP (net of the current level of collections). As
ratification of Armenia’s membership in the EEU is still pending, this revenue is not yet planned in
the 2015 budget, although with membership, it could start from January 2015. If membership
proceeds as expected, we will save the additional customs revenues until consultations with the IMF
staff at the time of the second review under the EFF. We expect to incorporate the additional
revenues into a supplementary budget along with additional priority social and investment
spending.
8.
Underexecution of the capital budget in recent years has been a source of concern.
Multiple factors have contributed to delays in the execution of capital projects, including ineffective
planning and project management capacity of project implementation units (PIUs), procurement
delays due to the technological complexity of some of the contracts, and specific problems with
land acquisition and resettlement on major road projects. We understand the importance of
strengthening investment in physical infrastructure for growth and job creation and have taken
measures to address constraints in project implementation. To address underspending on
externally-funded projects, we recently adopted a decree that requires PIUs to submit to the Office
of the Prime Minister monthly progress reports, with expected outcomes and risks for
implementation. This information is compiled and discussed in the cabinet and corrective actions are
being taken as needed. We will review the results from these measures and prepare an analysis and
actions to step up budget execution (new April 2015 structural benchmark). In parallel, we will
improve the procurement system for domestically-funded projects by fully shifting to eprocurement for both central and local governments effective in 2015. With this change, we expect
to achieve a more efficient and transparent procurement process.
9.
We continue to attach high importance to social spending and improved conditions
for the civil service. The budget allocation to social benefits programs in 2015 is about 7 percent
higher than in 2014. Spending on pensions will increase as well, mostly reflecting the carryover of a
pension increase for one target group from January 1, 2014 and for another target group from
July 1, 2014. We raised the monthly family allowance by AMD 1,000 to AMD 17,000 from
August 1, 2014 and expanded coverage of the program to reach nearly 105 thousand beneficiaries,
up from 84 thousand in 2011. The new Law on Social Assistance provides an integrated framework
for provision of social services. A key element in this framework is the establishment of integrated
social service centers (ISSC). We intend to create such centers in the remaining 36 areas across the
country, at least 10 of which will be launched in 2015. We will continue our efforts to improve the
quality of the civil service. An important step in that direction was the introduction of a new grade
structure for civil servants based on clear job descriptions and standardized salaries across different
government agencies and levels. The public sector wage increase, effective from July this year, will
help to attract and retain qualified staff.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

41

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

10.
We will aim to ensure that fiscal risks are identified, analyzed, disclosed, and managed
effectively. We will create a risk management unit (RMU) at the Ministry of Finance to monitor fiscal
risks arising from macroeconomic sources, as well as from regulated utilities, enterprises with state
participation, concessions, and PPPs (December 2014 structural benchmark). The RMU will be set up
following good international practices and in line with IMF TA recommendations. We will assess the
RMU’s capacity development requirements and may request additional TA from the IMF. The unit
will expand by May 2015 the statement of fiscal risks that is included in the Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework and budget documents, for example, to cover risks from utilities, enterprises
with state ownership, concessions, and PPPs.
11.
The guiding principles for tax policy continue to be strengthening the revenue gains
achieved in recent years, improving the fairness of the system, and supporting growth.
In 2014, we made several changes in tax legislation aimed at improving business conditions in a
difficult economic environment, while removing exemptions and aligning our tax regime with
international practices. We eliminated the minimum profits tax, reduced the turnover tax for small
companies in the trade sector conditional on providing supporting documentation, moved tobacco
products from the presumptive regime to regular excise taxation, and proposed elimination of VAT
exemptions for financial services not related to interest income. For 2015, we envisage additional
measures to provide stimulus to the economy. We will gradually replace the current mixed
(accrual/cash) method for determining VAT liability and providing credits/refunds with a unified
regime where both debits and credits are calculated on an accrual basis. The change will ease cashflow constraints for taxpayers and will be phased over three years, with estimated cost to the budget
of AMD 5 billion in the first year. Costs in the second and third years will be substantially higher and
will necessitate significant offsetting measures. In response to the continuing weaknesses in
construction, we will allow for income tax deductibility of mortgage payments under loans for
purchase of new apartments built after November 1, 2014. Tax incentives will also be provided to
some remote border regions adjacent to Azerbaijan. To contain the impact on revenues from these
changes, we will increase the natural resource user fee for non-metallic minerals in 2015 by
introducing royalties, and if necessary, and consider raising excise rates on alcohol and tobacco.
12.
We are continuing work on other tax policy changes that will contribute to enhanced
revenues over the program period. We will also continue to work on strengthening the framework
for taxation of high wealth individuals (HWIs). We have prepared a policy paper on strengthening
collections from HWI, covering necessary tax policy changes (e.g., dividend and capital gains
taxation), revenue administration actions and legal or regulatory changes (risk and compliance
profiles and audit), and the institutional set-up (September 2014 structural benchmark). We will
build on this to prepare specific proposals for cabinet (capital gains, dividends, property taxation,
audit), along with estimated revenue effects, if revenue gains are positive compared with potential
negative economic and financial impacts of the measures (new June 2015 structural benchmark). We
are initiating preparation of a new tax code, a major undertaking aimed at reforming the tax system
by reducing Armenia’s high tax compliance costs through introduction of well-defined set of
taxation principles and spelling out the rights and obligations of taxpayers and tax administration, in
line with best international practices. The code will replace numerous tax laws and regulations with a

42

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

single document. Preparation and enactment of the code will present an opportunity to eliminate
tax expenditures, subject the approval of new tax benefits to more stringent rules, and broaden the
tax base (e.g., agriculture, diesel fuel, LNG). To support this work, we included for the first time an
annex to the 2015 budget that lists and quantifies the main tax expenditures. Work on the tax code
has started and a working group at the Ministry of Finance will closely collaborate with international
agencies involved in the project. We expect to complete the first draft by the end of 2015. Finally,
the recently-established tax council has provided an encouraging platform for dialogue between the
government and the private sector on tax issues.
13.
We will intensify our tax and customs administration efforts to enhance compliance.
We established a Risk Management Unit in the SRC (June 2014 structural benchmark); the unit will
prepare a compliance strategy for 2015 and beyond, with comprehensive annual action plans and
monitoring (December 2014 structural benchmark). We have increased the number of large
taxpayers covered by the large taxpayer unit (LTU) from 471 to 515 with a commensurate increase in
the number of staff and will increase the number by a further 50 large taxpayers by March 2015. In
the past few years, we have introduced tax labeling of consumer products to strengthen collection
enforcement. We will expand further the list of goods subject to labeling in 2015 to include
pharmaceutical and food products, and we will require the introduction of new cash registers to
improve record keeping and tax compliance. Starting from next year, we will only accept electronic
invoices and from 2016, all documentation will be in electronic form. In the area of customs, we have
drafted the secondary legislation for the new customs code and have submitted it for review to the
government agencies. We will continue to improve the business environment by streamlining
customs documentation requirements and introducing a one-stop shop in customs clearance, while
at the same time enhancing risk management and post-clearance control systems. Improvements in
customs administration will also facilitate transshipment of goods to other Eurasian Economic Union
member countries across the territory of Georgia.
14.
We are determined to continue with the implementation of the flagship pension
reform. The reform aims to address a number of critical issues, including Armenia’s unfavorable
population dynamics, old-age poverty, and the lack of long-term funding in local currency.
Following a decision in March by the Constitutional Court to declare some provisions of the pension
law unconstitutional, we made amendments to the legislation to comply with the ruling and to
adjust other elements of the reform. We phased the introduction of the second pillar over a threeyear period through July 1, 2017, included the state budget in the process of collecting and
transferring the mandatory social payments to the individual retirement accounts (IRAs), and
provided some incentives to encourage participation, particularly by younger, high-wage workers.
These changes have necessitated a range of adjustments to procedures, software, websites and
financial and information flows, which are underway. Our efforts now are targeted at increasing
public awareness of the pension reform through various channels, including a new Internet pension
portal, a telephone hotline, TV and radio announcements, targeted briefings to large employers and
in regional cities and towns, and training courses. The success of the campaign hinges crucially on
building trust in the reform. In this regard, we have overcome the technical difficulties of transferring
the contributions to the IRAs, and we will minimize any possible financial costs associated with the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

43

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

implementation of the reform and address them in a transparent manner, by channeling them
through the state budget.

C. External Debt
15.
Maintaining debt sustainability remains a key priority for fiscal policy. We will pursue
options for budget support and financing of projects that involve concessional support, maximizing
private sector involvement, and strictly limiting government exposure and use of public funds. We
have concluded discussions on $300 million financing package with the Russian Federation to
extend the operating life of the Metsamor nuclear station. The package incorporates a sizeable grant
and a long-term, low-interest rate loan. To minimize risks for the budget, we will conclude a loan
arrangement with “Armenian Nuclear Power Plant” CJSC to ensure that debt obligations are met in a
timely manner. The modernization will be incorporated into the electricity tariff base, with adequate
and timely rate adjustments, so that “Armenian Nuclear Power Plant” CJSC can generate the
necessary cash flow to repay the obligation. Expected financing from the EU (MFA) in the amount of
$100 million over the period 2014–15 now appears unlikely to materialize. We will continue
discussions with the EU; in the meantime, we have addressed the financing shortfall, through
recourse to remaining financing from the 2013 Eurobond. We will continue to consult with the IMF
and the World Bank in advance of taking on any liabilities, including guarantees.

D. Monetary and Exchange Policy
16.
Monetary policy will continue to aim at maintaining price stability. The CBA initiated an
easing cycle in November 2013 in anticipation of weakening demand conditions and low inflationary
pressures. The policy rate has been reduced gradually by nearly 2 percentage points. At this stage,
we foresee that inflation will return to the target range within a year, but the CBA may pursue
further easing if conditions warrant.
17.
We continue to prepare for a transition of the monetary policy framework under the
Fund-supported program towards inflation targeting-based conditionality. Supported by Fund
TA, we have improved our forecasting and communication capacity. In addition, we have gained
experience in the operation of the transmission mechanism of interest rates during the recent period
of monetary easing and are drawing lessons that we will incorporate into our monetary policy
framework. While transitioning towards inflation targeting-based conditionality, we will continue to
ensure compliance with the program’s PC on net domestic assets, which remains an effective
complement to our monetary policy framework.
18.
Our monetary operations framework has performed well, but we envision further
strengthening. The interbank market remains well anchored around the central bank’s policy rate
and during the recent period of monetary easing, the CBA was able to steer overnight rates towards
the policy rate and to communicate effectively with the markets via press releases and the inflation
report. Nonetheless, the interbank market still exhibits significant volatility and continues to be
dominated by overnight transactions, while our communications strategy is focused on traditional

44

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

channels. In this context, we will continue to support the development of the interbank money
market—the platform for one-day and seven-day instruments is already operational—including
through adjustments to the central bank’s operational targets and by expanding our communication
efforts to reach a wider audience. In addition, we will assess obstacles to developing the FX
derivatives market and FX risk hedging instruments for the economy and market participants and
develop possible policy responses.
19.
A flexible exchange rate regime will continue to complement our inflation targeting
framework and support the external adjustment. CBA interventions in the foreign exchange
market will be limited and focused on mitigating disorderly conditions. Outside of those situations,
our policy will be to let the dram move according to its fundamentals—thereby avoiding economic
distortions and supporting external adjustment—while maintaining strong reserve buffers. We
remain conscious that our external current account deficit is still high and constitutes a source of
vulnerability and that our external competitiveness needs to be improved. We envisage that the
external current account deficit will continue to adjust over time without major disruptions—as in
recent years—supported by continued increases in tourism and mining, agricultural, and light
industrial exports and a moderation of credit growth.
20.
We will continue to take other actions to strengthen the independence and operations
of the CBA. The central bank has investments in some enterprises that are engaged in important
financial sector development and infrastructure activities. These include a credit card processing
company, a mortgage finance company, and a cash collection agency. Some of these enterprises are
profitable, others continue to require support. During 2014–15, the CBA will work with its external
auditors to present a consolidated position inclusive of these enterprises and will publish an annex
describing these investments in its annual report covering the rationale for the investments, along
with objectives, development strategy, enterprise risks, risk mitigation efforts, and where
appropriate, the CBA’s divestment strategy (new June 2015 structural benchmark). In addition, to
improve internal operations, the CBA will improve the charter for its board that outlines the roles
and responsibilities of board members and clarifies the nature of supervisory activities. Finally, the
CBA and the Government will work to advance long-pending legislation that would require the
government to issue marketable, interest-bearing securities to cover CBA losses. We will also seek
National Assembly approval of amendments to the Law on the CBA to provide the CBA with access
to company-level data for non-financial firms; this is needed to compile and analyze the balance of
payments statistics, for which the CBA is responsible.

E. Financial Sector Stability and Development
21.
We continue to implement reforms to promote resilience of the financial sector to
shocks and financial development and deepening. The CBA has issued regulations to gradually
require banks to set minimum capital requirements according to Basel III recommendations
(June 2014 structural benchmark). We will continue to set internal capital requirements above those
suggested by the Basel Committee to maintain strong buffers. We have developed a methodology
for identifying domestic systemically important banking institutions and are allocating additional

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

45

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

supervisory resources to those institutions. In line with past FSAP recommendations, we have
submitted to the National Assembly legislation to shorten the pay-out period of our Deposit
Guarantee Fund (September 2014 structural benchmark). To promote financial sector development,
we have prepared a policy paper on legal, regulatory, and institutional changes to simplify the
registration and execution of collateral—a key factor increasing borrowing costs and hindering
financial sector development (June 2014 structural benchmark). In addition, we submitted to the
National Assembly legislation to facilitate access of foreign participants in Armenia’s capital market,
which should facilitate the integration of the domestic and international markets (September 2014
structural benchmark).
22.
Further reforms will strengthen banking sector buffers and remove constraints on
intermediation. As we continue to align our prudential framework with Basel III recommendations
we will explore the implications of the new liquidity recommendations and revisit our current
liquidity and prudential frameworks. In particular, we will prepare a policy paper assessing our
liquidity and reserve requirement regulations, including their levels and currency of denomination,
impacts on interest rates, bank liquidity and buffers, and dollarization, compliance with new Basel III
recommendations, and exploring the scope for change (new March 2015 structural benchmark). In
addition, we will amend our regulation on the calculation of large exposures in order to align it with
international standards. In this context, we propose to drop the planned December 2014 structural
benchmark to avoid making changes that will contravene Basel III guidance. Finally, we will build on
the findings of the policy paper on registration and execution of collateral by consulting widely with
stakeholders to prepare and submit legislative changes to the National Assembly to address the
main obstacles hindering this important element of financial sector development (new
September 2015 structural benchmark).

F. Structural Reforms
23.
Objectives. We are committed to pursuing a comprehensive structural reform agenda, as
set out in the 2014–25 Armenia Development Strategy (ADS) and in cooperation with international
partners and other stakeholders. The Fund-support program provides a strong framework to
support reforms that are essential for addressing key risks and improving institutions, the business
climate, competition, openness, connectivity, and diversification.
24.
We look forward to an economic boost from joining the Eurasian Economic Union. We
expect that EEU membership will provide an impulse to Armenia’s exports to its traditional markets
by reducing tariff and non-tariff barriers and promoting new investment and trade links. It will also
facilitate travel and work arrangements for Armenians in Russia and the other EEU countries. Since
the weighted average EEU common external tariff rate is significantly higher (9.5 percent) than
Armenia’s current weighted average tariff rate (3.0 percent), we have secured transition periods to
the EEU common external tariff rates of one to eight years for 752 goods, for which Armenia’s
current tariffs are lower, and 18 goods for which Armenia’s current tariff rates are higher. Our aim to
accelerate structural reforms recognizes, in part, that higher tariffs could impose a burden on
Armenian consumers, and we will closely monitor impacts on the most vulnerable and on local

46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

market competition. As part of the accession agreement, we have requested $50 million in grants
from the founding EEU members to help finance the direct costs of customs union implementation,
such as new software and hardware for customs, and new agricultural and food testing labs.
25.
Armenia remains committed to deepening its relationship with the EU. We will continue
strong cooperation with the EU under the Eastern Partnership initiative and European
Neighborhood Policy Program and look forward to possible EU macro-financial support, continued
technical assistance, and institution-building arrangements (including twinning programs). We also
look forward to a new framework-type agreement to guide relations in all possible areas. EUArmenia cooperation will be developing in new sectors, such as civil aviation.
26.
Sound management of the energy sector is critical to mitigating risks and sustaining
strong growth. Ensuring the financial sustainability of energy companies and utilities is essential. To
this end, in July 2014 we raised end-user electricity tariffs by 10 percent to a level consistent with
cost-recovery and enhanced maintenance. In light of past losses and debt-equity transactions, we
are closely monitoring the operations and finances of the utility sector and met the end-June PC on
the non-absorption losses or liabilities or making of payments on behalf of utilities or other
companies. Also, while the gas price agreement signed in December 2013 with the Russian
Federation offers stable and competitive prices for the next five years, we consider that the
Armenian economy and consumers should become more energy efficient to reduce vulnerabilities,
cope with shocks, and be prepared for possible price adjustments after the agreement expires.
Accordingly, we have issued a decree approving a comprehensive 2014–2020 action plan on
Armenia’s energy security strategy. This action plan sets a timetable to put in place energy efficiency
investments, measures to improve the reliability of gas and electricity supplies, and continued
cooperation with Georgia and Iran on electricity transfers. Our next step will be to build on this work
by issuing, with support from the World Bank, a more comprehensive strategy that also includes (i) a
process to estimate costs of investment options and bring them into a least cost planning
framework; (ii) a strategy to involve the private sector and investors in energy sector projects and
mitigate costs and risks to the state budget; (iii) an explicit decision-making process for the possible
new nuclear power station; (iv) a review of tariff policies with a view to ensuring timely cost recovery
and addressing impacts on the poor; (v) a review of taxation of energy supplies and fuels; and (vi) a
plan to manage demand and encourage energy conservation (December 2014 structural
benchmark). Macro-critical components of this strategy will subsequently be incorporated in the
Fund-supported program.
27.


Other structural reforms areas:
Business climate. Under our regulatory guillotine program, we have developed a further six
packets for streamlining of regulations in entrepreneurship, tax, customs, social issues, foreign
affairs and international relations, and culture. We intended to submit all six packets to the
National Assembly for approval by June 2014 (structural benchmark), but the process was
delayed by the government transition. We now expect to submit these six packets and an
additional 10 packets to cabinet by March 2015. We will approve a decree establishing the
practice of regulatory impact assessment for new regulations by September 2015. This will help
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

47

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

better identify costs and benefits of new regulations and to monitor effectiveness once they are
in place. As part of the Doing Business Action Plan for 2014, we have introduced measures to
improve contract enforcement, the insolvency process, arrangements for payment of taxes, and
foreign trade, and the National Assembly enacted a new customs code in May 2014 that
provides for streamlining of procedures. We aim to establish a single customs window by
March 2015 to reduce costs and increase transparency. Cabinet will approve a new Doing
Business Action Plan by end-year.


Institutional administration: Achieving and sustaining higher economic growth calls for the
coordinated effort of all government agencies. The Ministry of Economy will take the lead role in
promoting GDP growth, while other line ministries and agencies will promote growth through
their own activities. We will undertake measures to improve public administration and promote
growth and tax compliance by addressing weaknesses in reporting and accounting.
Management and administrative shortcomings—and tax gaps—are evident in several sectors
with significant state activity, such as healthcare, natural resource use, energy, education,
transport, agriculture, and urban development and construction. We believe that more adequate
accounting, inventory, and reporting practices of the entities operating in these sectors would
promote growth and enhance enforcement of tax compliance. Our efforts will initially focus on
strengthening the reporting framework through overhauling existing accounting, reporting, and
information technology systems and introducing electronic invoicing and payments. By
December 2014, the government will approve a decree with an action plan detailing our specific
measures by sector (new December 2014 structural benchmark). The successful implementation
of these reforms will require broad support and active involvement of different government
agencies. However, the envisaged measures would bring significant benefits to the budget in
the form of better administrative control and management and revenue gains that would allow
stepping up spending in priority areas.



Competition: We have made progress to strengthen the powers of the State Committee for
Protection of Economic Competition (SCPEC). A package of legal changes related to projection
of economic competition, including clearer regulations of dominance and dominance abuse,
clearer fines and compliance with international standards, as well as procedural changes was
submitted to the National Assembly at the end of 2013. However, we did not meet the structural
benchmark on establishing memoranda of cooperation between the SCPEC and the Ministry of
Finance and the Prosecutor General’s Office (June 2014 structural benchmark), as we
encountered legal obstacles. The respective memorandum was concluded between SCPEC and
the National Police. An existing government decree on information exchange among
government agencies, including between SCPEC and the Ministry of Finance, should be
sufficient to facilitate cooperation, and we will work to ensure that information exchange and
follow-up actions in the area of competition are improved. In addition, based on the
recommendation of the SCPEC, provisions were included in the legal package to be submitted
to the National Assembly to allow for parallel import of pharmaceutical products through
alternative channels to promote greater competition and lower costs.



Bankruptcy reform. With a view to simplifying the complicated and inefficient insolvency
processes in Armenia, the entire process of bankruptcy has been outlined, and the obstacles and
gaps to be addressed through legislative amendments have been identified (June 2014
structural benchmark). As a result, it has been revealed that there exist shortcomings in the
process of bankruptcy and particularly in court processes that may result in significant delays in
bankruptcy proceedings. The provided recommendations include: (i) further improving
specialization in the examination of bankruptcy cases at the courts; (ii) bringing procedures in
line with international best practices; and (iii) increasing the number and qualifications of
bankruptcy administrators. The Ministry of Justice is reviewing—together with other state
authorities and interested parties—lessons learned in the bankruptcy outlining. Following these
consultations, draft legislation on the aforementioned amendments will be submitted to the
Government for consideration by June 2015 (new June 2015 structural benchmark).



Inspection reforms. We have been working on a major initiative to streamline inspection
agencies and functions, eliminate overlaps and outdated approaches, introduce risk-based
supervision and inspection, implement standard checklists, improve information systems,
implement electronic management systems, and reduce corruption risks, including through
better training and remuneration. These efforts should reduce business costs and strengthen
competitiveness, as well as improve the safety of services and products. We submitted a draft
law on inspection and inspection agencies to the National Assembly in October (March 2014
structural benchmark). Delays in submission of the draft law reflected resolution of issues to
ensure the operational and financial independence of inspection agencies. Our next step will be
to prepare an action plan for implementation of the new law.



Civil aviation. Recent measures to reform civil aviation have resulted in enhanced connectivity,
lower costs, and a boost to the tourism sector. With support from the World Bank and USAID,
we have developed a roadmap for reforms, and passed four decrees to restructure the
Directorate General for Civil Aviation (DGCA) and establish the new set-up for open skies
(April 2014 structural benchmark). Under the umbrella of a new Civil Aviation Council, the
Ministry of Economy is the lead policy agency while the DGCA serves as an independent
regulator. A single-window approach has been adopted to facilitate certification and
authorization procedures for airlines, which will be provided by the Ministry of Economy. A
newly-established board will set objective criteria and ensure unbiased certification and
authorization procedures. We have already removed restrictions with six countries and are
currently negotiating 14 further agreements in the framework of open skies policy and a
Common Aviation Area Agreement with the EU. We will continue to work to strengthen the
capacity of the two agencies to carry out their new functions.

G. Conclusion
28.
We request that the IMF Executive Board complete the First Review of the EFFsupported program. We also request that an amount equivalent to SDR 11.74 million be made
available upon completion of the review.
29.
We will maintain a close policy dialogue with the Fund and stand ready to take
additional measures, as appropriate, to ensure the achievement of our social and economic
objectives under the Fund–supported program. We will continue to consult with the Fund on the
adoption of measures, and in advance of revisions of the policies contained in the MEFP, in
accordance with the Fund’s policies on such consultation. We will also provide the Fund with
information it requests for monitoring program implementation. The program’s proposed
performance criteria (PCs), indicative targets (ITs), and structural benchmarks (SBs) are set out in

Attachment I. Technical Memorandum of Understanding

1.
This memorandum sets out the understandings between the Armenian authorities and
the IMF staff regarding the definition of performance criteria and indicative targets, their
adjusters, and data reporting requirements for the extended arrangement as per the Letter of
Intent and Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies dated February 17, 2014 and the
Letter of Intent for the First Review dated December 3, 2014.
2.
For program monitoring purposes, all foreign currency-related assets, liabilities, and
flows in the monetary accounts will be evaluated at program exchange rates. The program
exchange rate of the Armenian dram to the U.S. dollar is set at 410 dram per one U.S. dollar. The
cross-rates for other foreign currencies are provided in Table 1.

Quantitative Targets
3.
The program sets performance criteria and indicative targets for defined test dates
(see Table 1 in the LOI). The program sets the following performance criteria:


Floor on the net official international reserves (NIR) of the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA);



Ceiling on the net domestic assets (NDA) of the CBA;



Ceiling on external public debt arrears (continuous);



Floor on the program fiscal balance; and,



Ceiling on absorption of losses or liabilities and making of payments on behalf of utilities and
other companies (continuous).

The program sets the following indicative targets:


Headline inflation;



Floor on average concessionality of newly contracted external debt;



Ceiling on new government guaranteed external debt; and,



Floor on social spending of the government.

4.
The net official international reserves (stock) of the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) will be
calculated as the difference between total gross official international reserves (excluding commercial
bank required and excess reserves at CBA in FX) and gross official reserve liabilities.

54

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA



Gross official international reserves are defined as the CBA’s holdings of monetary gold
(excluding amounts pledged as collateral), holdings of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), including
the August 28, 2009 General Allocation and the September 9, 2009 Special Allocation, the
country’s reserve position at the IMF, and holdings of convertible currencies in cash or in
nonresident financial institutions (deposits, securities, or other financial instruments). Gross
reserves held in the form of securities and other financial instruments are marked to market.
Excluded from gross reserves are the balance on the government’s Special Privatization Account
(SPA), capital subscriptions in foreign financial institutions and illiquid foreign assets, any assets
that are pledged, collateralized, or otherwise encumbered, claims on residents, claims in foreign
exchange arising from derivatives in foreign currencies vis-à-vis domestic currency (such as
futures, forwards, swaps, and options), precious metals other than gold, assets in nonconvertible
currencies, and illiquid assets).



Official reserve liabilities shall be defined as the total outstanding liabilities of the government
and the CBA to the IMF and convertible currency liabilities of the CBA to nonresidents with an
original maturity of up to and including one year, as well as commitments to sell foreign
exchange arising from derivatives (such as futures, forwards, swaps, and options).

NIR is monitored in U.S. dollars, and, for program monitoring purposes, assets and liabilities in
currencies other than the U.S. dollar shall be converted into dollar-equivalent values using the
exchange rates as specified in Table 1.
5.
Headline inflation is defined as the year-on-year rate of change of the Consumer Price
Index as measured by Armenia’s National Statistics Service. The indicative target will be considered
met if headline inflation falls within a range of +/- 1½ percentage point around the mid-point
target.
6.
Net domestic assets are defined as reserve money minus NIR, minus other assets not
included in gross official international reserves, minus commercial bank required and excess reserves
at CBA in FX, plus medium and long-term foreign liabilities (i.e., liabilities with a maturity of one year
or more) of the CBA, plus other foreign liabilities not included in official reserve liabilities, minus the
balance of outstanding Fund purchases credited to the government account at the CBA. NDA is
composed of net CBA credit to the general government plus outstanding credit to domestic banks
by the CBA (including overdrafts) minus liabilities not included in reserve money and other items
net. The ceiling will be considered as met if the outcome is within AMD 15 billion of the indicative
target sets in Table 1 attached to the LOI.
7.
External public debt arrears are defined as all unpaid debt-service obligations (i.e.,
payments of principal and interest) arising in respect of public sector loans contracted or
guaranteed to non-residents, including unpaid penalties or interest charges associated with these

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

55

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

obligations that are overdue beyond 30 days after the due date.1 The ceiling on external payment
arrears is set at zero.
8.
The program fiscal balance is cumulative from the beginning of the fiscal year and is
measured from the financing side as the negative of the sum of net domestic banking system credit
to the central government, net domestic nonbank financing, and net external financing to the
central government. Should a general subsidy or any other fiscal transaction be introduced offbudget, the overall balance will be measured including the subsidy and other fiscal transactions as
part of government spending.


Net banking system credit to the central government equals the change during the period of
net credit to the central government.



Net nonbank financing equals the sum of: (1) the change during the period of outstanding
treasury bills and bonds to nonbanks (including accrued interest for treasury bills and excluding
accrued interest for treasury bonds); 2 (2) any other disbursement or transaction that increases
nonbanks’ claims on the central government plus withdrawals from the Special Privatization
Account (SPA) or the treasury sub-account containing privatization proceeds in drams, less
amortization paid by the central government to private resident nonbank agents.
2F2F



Net external financing equals total debt-increasing disbursements from non-residents to the
central government (including Fund net purchases credited directly to the government accounts
at the CBA) less total amortization from the central government to non-residents. Net external
financing also includes any privatization proceeds received from non-residents in foreign
currency and not held in the SPA. All foreign currency-denominated transactions are recorded in
drams using the prevailing exchange rate at the time of the transaction.

9.
External and domestic net lending, which are recorded as financing items, are excluded
from the calculation of the program fiscal balance. This effectively treats net lending as an
expenditure item when loans are made and as a revenue item when the loans are repaid.
10.
Transactions related to the extension of the operating life of the Metsamor nuclear
power station—which are expected to take place via lending from the Ministry of Finance of the
Russian Federation—will be excluded from the measure of the program fiscal deficit.
11.
Some project implementation units maintain accounts at the CBA. Grants received by
these units are recorded in the fiscal accounts as external grants on the revenue side and as foreign1

The public sector is here defined following the Government Financial Statistics Manual (GFS 2001) and System of
National Accounts (1993 SNA). It includes the general government and nonfinancial public enterprises (as defined in
paragraph 13).
2

Domestic nonbank holdings of treasury bills and treasury bonds are defined as total outstanding treasury bills and
bonds less holdings by the banking system and the State Fund for Social Insurance.

56

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

financed expenditure on the expenditure side. In addition, any loans to finance investments that are
intermediated through the banking system are recorded in the financial accounts as a financing item
below the line and are thus excluded from net lending. Under previous Technical Memoranda of
Understanding, these activities were excluded from the calculation of the program fiscal balance.
This treatment reflected lags in receiving information from project implementation units and on
project loans intermediated through the banking system. With the shift to semi-annual program
reviews with the arrangements under the previous Fund-supported program and consolidation of
the accounts of these units in the Treasury, there is no longer a need for such exclusion, and these
activities are now fully accounted for in the program fiscal balance.
12.
Foreign currency proceeds from selling enterprises are reflected in the state budget
and deposited in the SPA. In addition, the Government will ensure full transparency of revenues
and spending from the sales of major assets (beyond regular day-to-day operations) of enterprises
with state ownership. The SPA is held at the CBA and the proceeds are invested abroad together
with the CBA’s international reserves. These proceeds are included in the definition of the monetary
accounts of the CBA as part of net foreign assets with a counter entry in other items net. Any
withdrawal from the SPA will be accounted for as privatization proceeds used to finance the budget
and will be recorded below the line. Domestic currency proceeds from selling enterprises to
residents are deposited in a sub-account of the treasury single account and are also treated as a
financing item and recorded below the line. Finally, as noted in ¶8, privatization proceeds received
from non-residents in foreign currency and not held in the SPA are also treated as a financing item
(sale of financial assets) and recorded below the line.
13.
Absorption of losses or liabilities and making of payments on behalf of utilities and
other companies. The program sets a continuous ceiling on absorption by the public sector (central
and local governments and covering the state budget and state debt plus the CBA) of losses or
liabilities from outside the budgetary sector. Absorption of losses or liabilities is defined as direct
payment by the government of the losses or liabilities of other parties or coverage of losses or
liabilities by other transactions, such as debt-for-equity swaps or a write-off of tax obligations or
other state claims. The government is defined as the central government and covers obligations of
the state budget and state debt. The ceiling is set at zero, and excludes AMD 10.718 billion,
(approximately $26.1 million) of subsidies in the 2014 budget for Yerevan Metro, Yerevan Electric
Transport, Irrigations Systems, Armenian Water and Sanitation, Nor Akunk, and irrigation water
intake entities. For 2015, the ceiling will exclude support for these same firms in an amount not
exceeding AMD 13.561 billion. During the program period, there may be occasions when absorption
of a limited amount of losses or liabilities, or making limited payments on behalf of utilities or other
companies would facilitate a positive outcome (e.g., a major foreign investment transaction, poverty
alleviation or equity enhancement, or prevention of even greater losses that would endanger
financial stability). In such instances, the Armenian authorities will discuss the circumstances and
possible options with the Fund staff prior to any transaction. Any modification of the PC to make
any such payments or absorb any losses will require approval by the IMF Executive Board.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

57

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

14.
Floor on average concessionality of newly contracted external debt. The program sets
an annual indicative floor of 30 percent on the average concessionality of new debt on a contraction
basis with nonresidents with original maturities of one year or more as contracted and guaranteed
by the public sector.


The grant element is the difference between the present value (PV) of debt and its nominal
value, expressed as a percentage of the nominal value of the debt. The PV of debt at the time of
its contracting is calculated by discounting the future stream of payments of debt service due on
this debt. The discount rate used for this purpose is a unified discount rate set at 5 percent.



The public sector here comprises the general government (central, plus local governments and
covering the state budget and state debt), the central bank, and nonfinancial public enterprises
(enterprises and agencies in which the government holds a controlling stake—typically owns
more than 50 percent of the shares, but which are not consolidated in the budget).



For program purposes, the guarantee of a debt arises from any explicit legal obligation of the
public sector to service a debt in the event of nonpayment by the debtor (involving payments in
cash or in kind), or from any implicit legal or contractual obligation of the public sector to
finance partially or in full any shortfall incurred by the debtor.

15.
Ceiling on government guaranteed external debt. In addition to the indicative floor on
average concessionality, a separate ceiling (IT) of $100 million for the program period applies to
government guarantees of the total of concessional and non-concessional external financing. The
issuance of debt guarantees will be measured at the exchange rates listed in Table 1. The above limit
covers debt guarantees issued by the general government to entities outside the general
government. Guarantee issuance will be monitored on a monthly basis and the Ministry of Finance
will provide data within 21 days from the end of the month.
16.
The program sets a floor on social spending of the government. For the purposes of the
program, social spending of the government is defined as 100 percent of the budgeted amount of
the family benefit program and lump-sum financial aid, one-time childbirth benefits, and childcare
benefits for children less than two years of age.
17.
The quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets under the program are
subject to the following adjusters, calculated, where relevant, using program exchange rates:


58

Changes in reserve requirements: The ceiling on the NDA of the CBA will be adjusted
downward (upward) by the amount of banks’ reserves freed (seized) by any reduction (increase)
of the reserve requirement ratio on both domestic currency and foreign currency liabilities
relative to the baseline assumption as per the following formula: ΔNDA = ΔrB, where B denotes
the level of liabilities subject to reserve requirements in the initial definition and Δr is the change
in the reserve requirement ratio.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA



KfW, Asian Development Bank, and World Bank loan disbursements: the ceiling on the NDA
of the CBA will be adjusted upward (downward) by the full amount of any excess (shortfall) of
disbursements from the KfW, Asian Development Bank, and World Bank loans directed at SME
financing compared to programmed amounts (Table 2). The floor on NIR will be adjusted
upward (downward) by the cumulative amount of any excess (shortfall) of these disbursements
compared to program amounts.



Budget support grants to the public sector are defined as grants received by the general
government for direct budget support from external donors and not related to project financing.



Budget support loans to the public sector are defined as disbursements of loans from
bilateral and multilateral donors for budget support and Fund purchases credited directly to the
government accounts at the CBA.



Project financing to the public sector is defined as disbursements of loans from bilateral and
multilateral donors for public sector projects.



The floor on NIR will be adjusted upward (downward) by the cumulative amount of any excess
(shortfall) of budget support loans or budget support grants (excluding Fund purchases by the
government) compared to program amounts (Table 3). The floor on NIR will be adjusted
downward for any external public debt amortization amounts in excess of program amounts.
The floor on NIR will be adjusted upwards by the amount of any funds received in respect of
deposits held at the Inter State Bank.



The ceiling on NDA will be adjusted downward (upward) by the cumulative amount of any
excess (shortfall) of budget support loans or budget support grants compared to program
amounts (Table 3).



The floor on the program fiscal balance on a cash basis will be adjusted upward (downward)
by the cumulative total amount of the budget support grants received in excess (to account for
a shortfall) of the program amounts (Table 3), subject to a cap of $50 million per year in either
direction. The floor on the program fiscal balance on a cash basis will also be adjusted
downward (upward) by the cumulative total amount of the project financing received in excess
(to account for a shortfall) of the program amounts (Table 3), subject to a cap of $70 million in
either direction.

Annex I. Armenia’s Accession to the Eurasian Economic Union
1.
The presidents of Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia signed Armenia’s EEU
accession treaty in October. The EEU is a customs union and “single economic space” that calls for
free movement of goods, services, capital, and people within its borders. With a total GDP of nearly
$2.5 trillion in 2013, and more than 170 million people, EEU membership provides an opportunity for
Armenia to expand its exports and deepen integration with Russia, source of 90 percent of Armenia’s
remittances.
2.
Armenian exports could benefit from enhanced access to EEU markets. Armenia is
already a member of the CIS Free Trade Agreement, but EEU membership is expected to eliminate
the need for customs declarations and inspections, thus reducing non-tariff barriers and delays.
However, as Armenia does not share common borders with EEU members, gains will depend on
expedited transit procedures with Georgia.
3.
The authorities have sought to mitigate trade diversion and adverse impacts of higher
external tariffs. Since the weighted average EEU CET rate is higher (9.5 percent) than Armenia’s
current weighted average tariff rate (3.0 percent), Armenia has secured transition periods to the EEU
CET rates of one to eight years for 752 goods (including selected food products, chemicals,
medicines and medical equipment, cars, and machinery), for which Armenia’s current tariffs are
lower, and 18 agricultural products for which Armenia’s current tariff rates are higher. The EEU CET
rate schedule will decline over the medium term, reducing risks of trade diversion when transition
periods end. Armenia is not expected to have permanent exclusions from the CET schedule past the
transition period.
4.
Armenia could potentially benefit from higher customs revenues. Armenia has secured
1.13 percent of the EEU common customs pool from 2015, and Armenia could receive up to $250–
275 million annually, approximately 2½ percent of GDP, compared with 1 percent of GDP in customs
revenues at present. Excises, VAT, and customs fees are not covered and will remain national.
5.
Armenians are expected to have more secure access to the Russian labor market.
Armenians will not be required to obtain a work permit prior to seeking a job in any EEU member
state. They will have the same labor rights as Russian citizens, and will be considered legal residents
of Russia during the course of their employment. EEU citizens will also face fewer restrictions in
travelling between member states.
6.
EEU membership could possibly lead to deeper integration across a broad range of
areas. In addition to establishing a customs union, the EEU treaty provides a framework for further
collaboration, including macroeconomic, exchange rate, competition, energy, labor migration,
financial market, investment, and intellectual policies. In addition, the Eurasian Commission was
established as the permanent governing body of the union. Depending on the degree of political
will, the treaty could be just a customs union or lay the basis for much deeper integration.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

67

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

7.
In connection with EEU membership, Armenia has obtained additional benefits. The
authorities secured favorable terms for gas imports from Russia (with savings of 1.5 percent of GDP
per year), renewed security assurances, and concessional financing of $300 million to refurbish the
Metsamor nuclear plant. The authorities have also requested $50 million in grants from founding EEU
members to finance the direct costs of customs union implementation, such as new software and
hardware for customs, and new agricultural and food testing labs.
8.
There are costs and risks associated with EEU membership. Under EEU membership, the
Armenian economy may become more closely linked to the Russia economy, which is volatile, linked
to oil, and expected to grow slowly over the medium term, unless significant structural reforms are
implemented. Moreover, the end of negotiations on an Association Agreement with the EU could
mean the loss of a long-term reform anchor and convergence to EU standards.

Annex II. Pension Reform: Recent Developments and Changes
1.
Earlier this year, the Constitutional Court ruled some provisions of the pension reform
unconstitutional, in particular provisions related to mandatory contributions and allocation of
contributions to asset managers through non-budgetary channels. The court gave the
government and parliament until September to change the provisions. In July, the National Assembly
approved a new pension law that addressed the ruling and introduced other changes to address
concerns raised in public demonstrations, including a gradual implementation approach and
additional incentives for contributors.
2.
Incorporation of the state budget into the pension system architecture. Under the new
law, collections will be transferred to the depository through the budget and reported in the fiscal
accounts, with ownership transferred accordingly.


Gradual implementation. Mandatory contributions remain, but deadlines for joining vary for
different groups. Public sector employees were required to join from July 1st 2014. For private
sector workers, new labor market entrants must join immediately, while workers employed on
July 1, 2014 are allowed to postpone participation until July 2017, provided they submit an
application before December 25, 2014. This change will provide Pillar 2 with an estimated 65,000
participants by end-2014, compared with 275,000 originally envisaged.



Greater incentives to encourage participation include:
1. Caps for mandatory payments of high-wage individuals. Under the original law, mandatory
contributions—10 percent of salaries—were not capped. The new law establishes at a fixed
cap of AMD 25,000 until 2020, with indexation to increases in the minimum wage thereafter.
2. Matching contributions for individuals born after January 1964. Under the original law,
individuals born before 1974 were allowed to participate on Pillar 2 on a voluntary basis,
although without government matching contributions. Under the new law, matching will be
provided.
3. Early retirement. Under the new law, participants are entitled to draw a funded pension at age
55, if cumulated assets are sufficient to buy an annuity. Previously, early retirement was
allowed only for disability or changes in citizenship or moving to a foreign country.

3.
Assessment. Successful implementation of the new pension law hinges on several key
elements: (i) swift functioning of software changes and transfer of mandatory payments to personal
accounts; (ii) a successful strategy to bring on board private sector workers during 2015–17 and
reduce risks to the reform from parliamentary and presidential elections in 2017–18; and (iii) an
evaluation of the impact of the changes on the business plans of the two blue-chip foreign asset
managers and their capacity to contribute to local capital market development.

Annex III. Reserve Metrics and External Stability Assessment
Armenia has made progress in rebuilding reserve buffers that declined in the crisis years, and the
current level is broadly adequate by most reserve metrics. The rebuilding of reserves is a welcome
development, given that the economy remains vulnerable to shocks, while high dollarization calls for
added reserve cushions. Moreover, despite the considerable external adjustment in 2013, the current
account deficit is still sizeable at around 8 percent of GDP, and staff’s estimates suggest that a further
adjustment of the dram in real terms is needed over the medium term. External debt sustainability has
deteriorated somewhat, and high external gross financing needs raise rollover risks.
1.
Armenia’s current level of reserves appears broadly adequate. Gross reserves are
projected to cover 4.7 months of imports

2.
Armenia’s external debt-to-GDP ratio remains high, and is expected to decline only
moderately in the medium term. The ratio was 82 percent of GDP at end-2013, and it is projected
to decline to around 81 percent by 2019. The ratio improved rapidly in the mid-2000s reaching a low
of 29½ percent of GDP in 2008. The improvement was largely due to exchange rate appreciation and
growth, as well as increasing non-debt creating FDI inflows, partly offset by modest current account
deficits. Subsequently, the debt-to-GDP ratio increased with the global crisis (both as a result of
higher nominal debt and lower GDP). Large external current account deficits—partly offset by FDI
flows—were the most important factor in the deterioration in the external debt-to-GDP ratio in this
period with some contribution from the nominal interest rate.

70

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

3.
Staff’s assessment of external debt sustainability has deteriorated with the revised
projections. This is primarily due to lower revised medium-term projections for growth and FDI. The
debt stabilizing non-interest current account deficit is estimated at 5.7 percent of GDP as opposed to
6.9 percent of GDP previously. In the baseline, the change in external debt is dominated by current
account deficits (excluding interest payments) averaging about 4.2 percent of GDP during 2014−19,
which is offset by projected non-debt creating FDI, whereas automatic debt dynamics have a smaller
impact.
4.
External sustainability is sensitive to standard shocks other than the nominal interest
rate. The external debt ratio increases to 94–97 percent of GDP under standardized shocks to growth
and the non-interest current account, as well as under the combined scenario (Figure 1 below). A
one˗time 30 percent real ER depreciation would raise the debt ratio by around 36 percentage points
above the baseline path to 117 percent of GDP in 2019. Given the large share of concessional
financing in external public debt, external sustainability is robust to a standardized shock to the
interest rate.

Annex IV. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) using staff’s baseline medium-term macroeconomic projections
suggests that Armenia’s public debt remains sustainable. Alternative scenarios based on constant
primary balance and key variables at their historical averages do not result in significant increases in
public gross financing needs or debt levels.
1.
Gross public debt stood at 43.4 percent of GDP at the end of 2013, slightly lower than
a year earlier. In the period before the crisis, debt was on a declining trend, falling from 40 percent
of GDP in 2003 to 16 percent of GDP in 2008. Against the background of sharply deteriorating
economic conditions, debt started to accumulate quickly and in 2009 alone the debt ratio increased
by 24 percent of GDP, due to contraction of output, depreciation of the dram and new borrowing,
including a $500 million loan from Russia. This loan was fully repaid with the proceeds from a
$700 million Eurobond that the government successfully placed in 2013.
2.
Macroeconomic assumptions underlying the current DSA have changed since the time
of the program request. The changes were triggered primarily by the worsening of the external
environment, notably the growth outlook for Russia. GDP growth projections for Armenia have been
marked down reflecting weaker exports and remittances. The fiscal deficit in 2014 will most likely be
below the budget target due to lower matching pension contributions and continuing
underexecution of the capital budget. The primary deficit is projected to remain in the 0.2–
0.8 percent of GDP range in the medium term, well below the estimated debt-stabilizing level of
1.6 percent of GDP.
3.
Going forward, under the baseline scenario public debt is expected to remain the
range of 44–46 percent of GDP till 2016 and gradually decline thereafter. The small initial
increase is mainly driven by the assumed gradual adjustment of the dram exchange rate over the
medium-term to correct for the misalignment established in the real exchange rate assessment
(Annex V). As growth picks up and the exchange rate approaches its equilibrium value, public debt is
expected to decline to 43.6 percent in 2019. Government’s gross financing needs remain moderate
during the period under consideration as the Eurobond repayment does not occur until 2020.
4.
Alternative scenarios based on assumptions of a constant primary balance and key
variables at their historical averages do not deviate much from the baseline. The dynamics of
public debt and gross financing needs under the constant primary balance scenario closely mirror
the baseline. Under the historical scenario, financing needs increase over the medium term but do
not exceed 8 percent of GDP, and the debt ratio stays below 50 percent. Overall, the foregoing
analysis confirms the conclusion in the previous DSA that Armenia’s public debt remains sustainable.
Maintaining prudent fiscal policy in the future would allow reducing the level of debt over time and
freeing up space for much needed investments in infrastructure and human capital.

Historical Scenario

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

Annex V. Real Exchange Rate Assessment
1.
Despite a sizeable improvement since 2012, Armenia’s external current account deficit
remained large at 8 percent of GDP in 2013, and is expected to improve only gradually over
the medium term.1 2 The sharp improvement in 2013 was primarily due to earnings of Armenians
abroad; the net increase in compensation of employees and private transfers was around
$270 million, equivalent to around 2.6 percent of GDP. The improvement in services was also
significant, mostly related to construction abroad, whereas the trade balance only improved
marginally. With cautious projections for both remittances and exports going forward, the current
account deficit will improve slowly to 6.5 percent of GDP by 2019.
2.
Staff’s estimates suggest that an adjustment of the dram in real terms would be
needed in the medium-term to bring the external current account into equilibrium. The extent
of REER misalignment is assessed using a combination of the Fund’s new External Balance
Approach-lite (EBA-lite) and CGER-type methodologies. 3 Potential real ER misalignment is assessed
using the macrobalance approach developed under EBA-lite, which replaces the previous CGER-type
macrobalance approach, and the external sustainability approach, as well as the equilibrium real
exchange rate approach using CGER-type models. In the EBA-lite methodology, the norm is based
on 2013 actual figures; for the other approaches the
Effective Exchange Rates
norm is based on projections.

The exchange rate is estimated to be
overvalued in real terms (see text table). The
macrobalance approach suggests a current account norm
of -6.6 percent of GDP for 2013, about 1.4 percentage
points less than the current account that year. The current
account norm assumes a desired P* medium-term fiscal
deficit that is 0.5 of GDP lower than the 2013 cyclically
adjusted headline fiscal balance (2.3 percent, including
the ArmRusGaz transaction), no change in desired
international reserves, and a benchmark level of private
credit to GDP that is 10 percentage points higher than
the 2013 level (42.8 percent). This EBA-lite methodology-

EBA-lite is an extended EBA methodology developed by Fund staff. See IMF WP/13/272 for details of the
methodology. One essential difference is that EBA makes a sharper distinction between positive (descriptive)
understanding of current accounts and real exchange rates and making normative evaluations. Another is that EBA
takes into account a much broader set of factors—including policies, cyclical conditions, and global capital market
conditions—that may influence the current account and real exchange rate.

based calculation would imply an ER misalignment of about 10 percent. The CGER-type external
sustainability approach estimates a current account norm for Armenia that stabilizes the ratio of Net
Foreign Assets (NFA) to GDP of the country around its norm (5.3 percent of GDP). Comparing this
current account norm with its underlying value implies a REER overvaluation of 8.3 percent. Finally,
the reduced form equilibrium real exchange rate approach, suggests an undervaluation of around
0.2 percent, taking into account information up to Q3 2014. Taking account of the depreciation of
the Russian ruble against the dram since then would suggest an overvalued exchange rate in real
terms.
4.
These methodologies are subject to limitations and are sensitive to assumptions; the
results should therefore be viewed with some caution. And while the exact magnitude of
overvaluation is difficult to determine with certainty, the results do tend to confirm the view
suggested by the evolution of the balance of payments that the real ER remains moderately
overvalued, despite improvement in the external current account in the last few years.

Safeguards Assessment
Under the Fund’s safeguards policy, an update safeguards assessment of the Central Bank of Armenia
(CBA) was concluded in August 2014 with respect to the extended arrangement approved in March 2014.
The CBA has established good practices in financial reporting, the external audit mechanism, and the
internal audit function. The assessment made recommendations to strengthen the independence and
operations of the CBA.
Exchange Rate Arrangement
The de jure arrangement is “free floating.” The de facto arrangement was reclassified to “floating” from a
“stabilized arrangement,” effective March 3, 2009. More recently, and following interventions to rebuild
reserves in the last three quarters of 2013, the de facto arrangement was reclassified from floating to
crawl-like arrangement, effective March 12, 2013. This designation reflects the appreciation of the
Armenian dram within a 2 percent band against the U.S. dollar during the last three quarters of 2013.The

RELATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN BANK FOR
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT (EBRD)
(As of October 21, 2014)
1.

As of October 21, 2014, the EBRD had approved 131 projects in the power, transport,

agribusiness, municipal and infrastructure, manufacturing and services, property,
telecommunications, and financial sectors. Total commitments amounted to around
EUR 757.8 million. During the year 2014, the EBRD signed 10 projects with a total volume of EUR
50.1 million.
2.

EBRD has signed six sovereign projects in Armenia to-date. First, the EBRD approved a

sovereign guaranteed loan of EUR 54.8 million for construction of the Hrazdan Unit 5 thermal
power plant in March 1993. The government was contemplating the privatization of Hrazdan Unit 5
as the completion of this plant was constrained by limited budgetary resources. The EBRD had
funded TA for the Hrazdan privatization prospectus and followed the privatization process. Second,
in November 1994, the agreement on a EUR 21.8 million loan to build an air cargo terminal in
Zvartnots airport was signed under a guarantee by the Armenian government. The airport was
transferred to private management in 2002 (according to a concession agreement). The new
management prepared a master plan for the development of the airport, which is expected to
generate further cargo traffic for the cargo terminal. In April 2007, the EBRD approved a EUR 7
million loan to the State Committee for Water Systems, owner of the water and wastewater assets
located in the small municipalities outside of Yerevan. The proceeds of this loan have been used to
improve wastewater treatment in five municipalities located near Lake Sevan. In March 2010, EBRD
signed a first EUR 5.0 million sovereign loan with Yerevan Metro Company. This project is providing
emergency investments in the Yerevan Metro, covering immediate rehabilitation needs including
safety upgrades and energy efficiency. The investment is part of a plan to improve and reform public
transport services in the capital of Armenia. In August 2012, EBRD signed its second EUR 5.0 million
sovereign loan with Yerevan Metro to primarily address issues related to water ingress into the
tunnels. In November 2012, the EBRD signed a EUR 10 million loan to the Armenian government for
the construction of a new bridge at Bagratashen, the main border crossing point between Armenia
and Georgia, as part of the EU’s Integrated Border Management regional initiative. Other financiers,
including EIB, the EU, EU NIF, UNDP and the Armenian government, have joined forces to rehabilitate
transport infrastructure at the Armenian-Georgian border.
3.

Most of the Bank’s projects (87%) in Armenia are in the private sector. In addition to the

loan to Electric Networks of Armenia (see below), the Bank approved an additional loan to Zvartnots

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

International Airport in the amount of EUR 29.6 million (supplemented by investments from ADB and
DEG). This project followed on from the successful completion, in May 2007, of the first phase of the
Passenger Terminal, for which the Bank provided a EUR 14.8 million loan together with DEG (USD 10
million). This project involved the construction and purchase of equipment for the second phase of
the Passenger Terminal complex at Zvartnots International Airport and facilitated the completion of
Airport Terminal development reallocating all operations (arrivals and departures) from the old
Airport building. The loan was a commercial facility with no sovereign support. In 2009 and 2011, the
Bank invested a total of USD 7.4 million in Lydian Int., is a Jersey-based company listed on the
Toronto Stock Exchange. In 2014 an additional USD 3 million was invested by EBRD bringing our
equity share to 7.9%, on par with IFC. Lydian’s largest shareholders include two US funds (c.10% and
9%) followed by IFC and EBRD (c.8%, 8%) and management and directors (c.8%), who own a number
of exploration assets in Armenia (through its 100% owned subsidiary Geoteam) and Georgia. Other
private sector finance includes relatively smaller loans to private companies and equity participation
in a number of companies in various sectors of the industry.
4.

By the mid of October 2014 the Bank committed EUR 50.1 million to Armenia through

10 transactions, including 8 projects in the financial institutions sector (it is worth mentioning
that two transaction relate to an energy efficiency credit line which will also cater for
residential users, the first of its kind for EBRD in Armenia), one in Natural Resources and one
in Agribusiness sector.
5.

In the banking sector, a first equity participation in the Commercial Bank of Greece-

Armenia (EUR 1.1 million) was approved in late 1999. Now there are four local banks where
EBRD participates in equity: Armeconombank, Byblos Bank Armenia, Ararat Bank and
ProCredit Bank.
6.

The Armenia Multi-Bank Framework Facility II (AMBFF II), established to provide loans

and equity to commercial banks and leasing companies in Armenia, was approved by the
EBRD Board in March 2006 for an amount of $40 million, and then extended for another $80
million in November 2007. In late 2009, the EBRD has approved a further $100 million extension to
AMBFF II in order to support increased financial intermediation and the development of the financial
sector in Armenia and to contribute to economic development by providing medium to long-term
funding to selected Armenian financial intermediaries. Another extension to this Facility of $100
million was approved in mid-2011. The Facility seeks to develop new products for financial
institutions, including provision of local currency loans, agricultural credit lines and mortgage
financing. Through the program additional TA is provided to partner banks.

7.

The EBRD expanded its relationship with partner banks in Armenia from four to twelve

(taking into account that two EBRD clients – Ameria Bank and Cascade Bank merged in 2010).
Nine banks were provided with new credit facilities under the AMBFF. One institution
(Armeconombank) was provided with a mortgage facility, and the first leasing facility in Armenia was
signed with ACBA Leasing in 2008 for EUR 5.9 million. A co-financing facility with six local banks was
also extended resulting in 14 sub-loans to Armenian corporates. By means of co-financing lines, the
Bank has entered such new sectors as healthcare and telecoms, in addition to significantly expanding
its portfolio of agribusiness loans. A Trade Facilitation Program with the purpose of facilitating access
of Armenian banks to trade financing was also made available to nine Armenian banks.
8.

By the mid of October 2014, the EBRD has disbursed about EUR 85 million in local

currency to Armenian commercial banks and micro financing institutions. Another EUR 20
million equivalent in Armenian drams are in the pipeline. The Currency Exchange (TCX) provides
the Armenian dram hedge to the EBRD. In parallel, the EBRD and IMF are assisting the government
and the CBA to implement reforms aiming to facilitate financing in dram, reduce the level of
dollarization, and foster the development of local capital markets.
9.

The one-year bonds for a total of AMD 2 billion (approximately USD $5 million) were

placed via an auction on the NASDAQ OMX Armenia exchange in Yerevan on 31 January. This
was the first publicly-auctioned issue by either a foreign borrower or an international financial
institution on NASDAQ OMX and it was also the first floating rate note to be issued on the local
market. Ameriabank CJSC and HSBC Bank Armenia CJSC acted as advisers and agents to the issuer.
10.

In early 2012, EBRD together with other international financial institutions supported

the creation of the Caucasus Growth Fund. This fund is managed by the Small Enterprise
Assistance Funds (SEAF), a global fund manager, and is be the first institutional quality fund to
provide debt and equity to SMEs in the Caucasus region.
11.

Supporting development of renewable energy is another core activity of the Bank. To

that end, the EBRD joined forces with the WB, USAID, and Cascade Credit (a financing arm of
Cafesjian Foundation) to launch the Armenian Renewable Energy Program (AREP). The Bank’s
participation took the form of a loan to Cascade Credit. The Bank also continued to finance
renewable energy projects on its own through a Direct Lending Facility, with two such projects
signed. In addition to renewable energy, the Bank returned to the mainstream segment of the sector,
seeking to support post-privatization development with a loan to the Armenian privately-owned
power distribution company. In April 2009, the EBRD signed a EUR 42 million loan with Electric
Networks of Armenia to upgrade and modernize obsolete low-voltage infrastructure and improve

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

energy efficiency. In December 2012, the EBRD provided a EUR 19 million loan to International
Energy Corporation (IEC) to finance the rehabilitation of seven hydropower plants of the SevanHrazdan Cascade. The project is bringing the Company’s technical standards in line with best
international practice.
12.

The EBRD launched the Enterprise Growth Programme (EGP) and Business Advisory

Service programs in Armenia in 2003 to support micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises.
Since 2003, BAS has completed 936 projects in the amount of EUR 5.9 million, as well as 63 Market
Development Activity (MDA) projects. EGP has delivered more than 25 projects. Among the donors
is Canada, Taiwan Province of China, the United Kingdom, the EU, EU - Eastern Partnership MultiBeneficiary Technical Assistance, the United States, the Early Transition Countries Fund (ETCF), the
EBRD, and EBRD Shareholder Special Fund (ESSF).
13.

The Bank has launched a USD 25 million program to finance projects for industrial

energy efficiency and renewable energy through local banks. In October 2010, the first USD
3.0 million, energy efficiency credit line was signed with Anelik Bank. TA has been put in place
financed by the Government of Austria. The Bank has also launched a TA program to review and
amend the legal, regulatory, institutional, operational and technical frameworks for energy efficiency
in the residential sector. Since 2013 three of the largest banks and one credit organisation joined the
program signing loans of EUR 15m in total to be on-lent to industrial and residential EE sub-projects.
EBRD will continue offering financing and capacity building to Armenian commercial banks to
support investments in this sector. The residential sector in Armenia is a large energy consumer with
significant potential for energy savings and carbon emission reductions.
14.

As part of inspection reform and doing business programs, the EBRD is assisting the

government toward improvement of the business environment. The EBRD supported the roll-out
of a corporate governance code in cooperation with the Ministry of Economy, the Central Bank, the
Stock Exchange and the IFC. The Bank is also providing assistance to the Public Services Regulatory
Commission for telecommunications sector regulation. This assistance is being financed by the
Government of Finland.
15.

The EBRD’s current country strategy was approved in May 2012. The key priorities of the

EBRD for the coming three years are: (i) developing the financial sector and improving access to
finance; (ii) improving municipal and urban transport infrastructure; (iii) developing agribusiness and
high value-added, export-oriented industrial companies; and (iv) improving the regulatory and
institutional framework for sustainable energy and increasing value added in the mining sector. The
new Country Strategy will be adopted in July 2015.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(ASDB)
(As of October 15, 2014)
1.
Armenia joined AsDB in September 2005, and is currently eligible for financing from
AsDB’s concessional Asian Development Fund (ADF), as well as its non-concessional Ordinary
Capital Resources (OCR). AsDB’s country operations business plan (COBP) for 2014–16, approved
in December 2013, identifies infrastructure development as priority area for AsDB’s operations. AsDB
is preparing a new 2014–18 country partnership strategy for AsDB’s Board consideration in 2015.
2.
As of October 15, 2014, the AsDB cumulative sovereign lending amounted to
$839.67 million. In September 2014 AsDB signed a loan agreement with the Ministry of Energy and
Natural Resources on «Power Transmission Rehabilitation Project» ($37 million) to increase the
efficiency of power system operation and reduce transmission losses. “Infrastructure Sustainability
Support Program” ($49 million) approved in October 2014, will improve road and water service provision
through results-based public management and financing reforms. The program will introduce a crosssector approach, where sector and finance ministries collaborate at all four levels of results-based
management—planning, budgeting, implementation, and monitoring.

3.
In 2012 AsDB approved two public sector loans. The Women's Entrepreneurship Support
Sector Development Program, approved in October 2012, will promote gender-inclusive growth by
improving the enabling environment and capacity of women entrepreneurs and micro and small
enterprises (MSMEs). The program includes two components: (i) a program loan ($20 million)
supporting reforms related to improving the business environment for women; and (ii) a financial
intermediation loan ($20 million) through the German-Armenian Fund in which medium-term local
currency loans will be made by participating financial institutions to MSMEs, with at least 50% of the
loans going to women’s MSMEs. In 2012, AsDB provided $40 million as additional financing for the
Water Sector and Sanitation Sector Project, approved in 2007, for improving access to safe, reliable,
and sustainable services in about 29 towns and up to 160 project villages, managed on commercial
principles and with environmentally sound practices.
4.
In 2011, ADB approved a $400 million multi-tranche financing facility (MFF) for the
Sustainable Urban Development Investment Program, which aims to help Armenia upgrade
its urban transport services, to improve living conditions, and bolster economic opportunities
in 12 of the country’s major and secondary cities. In 2011, AsDB approved Tranche 1 for $48.64
million to improve and extend the urban infrastructure and to strengthen the institutional capacity
in Yerevan.
5.
In 2009, ADB approved a $500 million MFF to fund the North–South Road Corridor
Investment Program. In 2009 AsDB approved Tranche 1 ($60 million) for improving the YerevanAshtarak section of the road. Tranche 2 ($170 million) approved in 2010 finances the upgrade of the
road between Ashtarak and Talin. In 2013 AsDB approved Tranche 3 for $100 million to finance
12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

continuing construction of the road to Gyumri (additional co-financing will be provided by the
European Investment Bank). Tranche 3 will also finance engineering and economic studies of the
southern sections of the North-South Road Corridor.
6.
The Crisis Recovery Support Program Loans ($80 million), approved in July 2009,
helped Armenia through the global financial crisis by allowing it to protect budgetary social
spending and implement anti-crisis measures in a time of economic contraction and declining
fiscal revenues.
7.
In 2007, AsDB approved a $30.6 million loan for the Rural Road Sector Project to help
the government upgrade 220 kilometers of rural roads. A supplemental financing of
$17.32 million was approved in 2008 to address financial shortcomings of the project. A $36
million loan for the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project, approved in 2007, helped the
government repair and replace water supply infrastructure in small towns and villages.
8.
With the exception of the North-South Road Corridor Tranche 2 and Tranche 3
investment program loans, all approved sovereign loans are from the AsDB's concessional
ADF. The Tranche 2 and Tranche 3 loans for the North-South road are from the AsDB’s nonconcessional OCR.
9.
AsDB has approved four private sector projects a total of $133 million in nonsovereign financing in Armenia and one trade finance program. In May 2013, ADB signed a $25
million loan with International Energy Corporation to rehabilitate and to improve the reliability and
safety of Sevan-Hrazdan Cascade Hydropower, in a program cofinanced with the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). In November 2011, AsDB approved a non-sovereign
lending program totaling $65 million for four commercial banks to expand lending to small and
medium-size enterprises (SMEs). One non-sovereign loan for $40 million was provided to Armenia
International Airports for the Zvartnots Airport Expansion Project (Phase 2). The loan financed the
construction of a new terminal building and purchase of equipment to supplement the existing
concourse building, in a program cofinanced with EBRD and DEG (German Investment and
Development Corporation). In 2007 AsDB extended a $3 million loan to a local bank for on-lending
to small businesses. AsDB’s Trade Finance Program works with three banks in Armenia and has
supported over $19 million in trade.
10.
In addition to financing projects and programs, the AsDB is also involved in advisory
services and capacity development. These include technical assistance programs for urban
development in secondary cities, improved access to finance for women entrepreneurs,
infrastructure sustainability, preparation of an investment forum, and solid waste management. In
2013 ADB approved a TA program to carry out seismic risk mitigation study of public buildings in
four secondary towns. Armenia is also included in a number of AsDB's multi-country TA projects,
providing assessments and development plans in topics of common interest across countries.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of November 14, 2014)
Background
1.
Data provision by Armenia has shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
In November 2003, Armenia subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), and
the overall quality, timeliness, and coverage of macroeconomic statistics have improved
significantly over the past few years. The IMF has supported this process through TA from the
Statistics Department (STA), the Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD), and the Monetary and Capital
Markets Department (MCM). An April 2008 data ROSC mission prepared a detailed evaluation of
the quality of macroeconomic statistics. A multi-topic statistics mission visited Yerevan in
February 2010 to review progress with implementation of past recommendations and follow up on
outstanding issues in national accounts, balance of payments, and monetary and financial statistics.
A follow up STA mission in September 2010 provided further guidance, focusing on improving the
accuracy of annual and quarterly GDP estimates. Further improvements in real, fiscal, and external
sector statistics would be desirable to facilitate enhanced design and monitoring of economic
policies.
Real sector statistics
2.
The National Statistics Service (NSS) compiles and disseminates annual and quarterly
national accounts. The NSS also compiles and disseminates annually a full set of accounts (up to
financial accounts) for the total economy and by institutional sectors. The NSS is developing a plan
for implementing the System of National Accounts 2008 (2008 SNA).
3.
The accuracy of the annual estimates of the national accounts is undermined by the
lack of exhaustive source data for informal activities and of appropriate price and volume
indicators, particularly for construction activities. Construction output volume measures are
derived by deflating current values with a price index for output, which uses weights and base year
prices from a survey in 1984. To improve volume measures of construction, the NSS has started
compiling a new construction output price index based on more sound methodology. Until the new
construction price index becomes available, the NSS should use other indicators for deriving
construction aggregates at constant prices. The NSS should also implement new surveys to derive a
proper benchmark for informal activities.
4.
The production-side estimates at current prices are derived partially from cumulative
source data (from business statistics surveys) and partially from discrete data sources. The NSS
validates and reconciles data from different sources, but underlying problems associated with decumulating the cumulative output data distort the quarterly pattern. The NSS is currently working to
produce GDP data at current and at constant prices to be fully in accordance with the SNA. The NSS
received IMF TA on estimating quarterly GDP from discrete data sources only and is using statistical
techniques that conform to international standards. Recent publications of the NSS have reflected
this effort. The NSS has discontinued compiling GDP volume measures at the prices of the

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

corresponding quarter of the previous year and instead adopted the recommendation of the IMF
STA mission to compile only one set of quarterly GDP estimates—quarterly GDP at previous-year
average prices—and derive time series through chain-linking. These estimates would be
conceptually consistent with the annual data. They would also allow comparisons between different
periods, which are essential for analysis of the business cycle. Since 2012, NSS has discontinued
compiling GDP on average prices of 2005 and instead they just published GDP for 2009-2012 on
average prices of year 2008. As of January 2011, the NSS also started compiling a monthly indicator
of economic activity (IEA), following international best practices. The monthly GDP compilation was
discontinued. The monthly IEA is an implicit volume index compiled by aggregation of monthly
volume indices of output using gross output weights. The CPI covers 11 large population centers
and Yerevan. Since January 2011, the CPI has been computed using 2010 weights. Concepts and
definitions used in the compilation of the CPI are broadly in line with international standards; source
data and compilation techniques are generally adequate. The NSS compiles a ten-day and a
monthly CPI. The ten-day index and the monthly index are disseminated jointly. A February
data 2009 ROSC mission recommended development of an approach to include household
expenditure on owner-occupied dwellings in the CPI calculations.
Government finance statistics
5.
The budget execution reporting system compiles government finance data on a cash
basis, supplemented with monthly reports on arrears and quarterly reports on receivables and
payables. Daily revenue and cash expenditure data for the central government are available with a
lag of one to two days and monthly data on central government operations are disseminated one
month after the reporting period. The ministry of finance (MoF) is undertaking a comprehensive
reform of the treasury system, including the introduction of an internal auditing system in line
ministries and their respective budgetary institutions. A treasury single account (TSA) was introduced
in 1996, and all bank accounts held by budgetary institutions were closed, except for project
implementation units (PIU) that are required by donors to operate with commercial bank accounts.
Since 2010 these PIU accounts also are being moved gradually to the TSA. Starting in 2002, some
budgetary institutions have been converted into “noncommercial organizations” (NCOs). These units
have been taken out of the treasury system and have their own bank accounts, but since 2003
report data on cash flows and balances to the MoF. The February 2009 ROSC report recommended
including NCOs in the government finance statistics data published on national websites. These
exceptions notwithstanding, all government receipts and payments are processed through the TSA,
although there are still shortcomings on the timeliness and quality of data on the operations of local
governments.
6.
The budget presentation and the classification of items under the economic and
functional classification of expenditures need to be made more transparent; for instance, the
data have been subject to frequent reclassification, and wages for military personnel, teachers, and
doctors are reported in the category of goods and services and other expense, rather than as a wage
item. The February 2009 ROSC report recommended using market value rather than face value for
financial assets other than loans, and for nonfinancial assets. The reconciliation of central
government with general government operations is done by the NSS in cooperation with the MoF.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

7.
Since 2008, government finance statistics meet the classification requirements of the
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) for the central government.
Monetary and financial statistics
8.
Monetary and financial statistics are provided on a timely basis. Data on the accounts of
the CBA are provided daily with a one-day lag, while monthly data on the monetary survey are
provided with a three-week lag (and preliminary weekly data with a one-week lag). The balance
sheets of the CBA and of the deposit money banks follow IAS methodology. Monthly interest rate
data are provided with a one-week lag.
9.
Responding to an IMF STA request, the CBA has compiled and submitted a complete
set of monetary data beginning from December 2001 using standardized report forms (SRF).
STA validated the resulting monetary aggregates, and the data have been published since the
December 2006 issue of IFS Supplement and are used to update IFS. An integrated monetary
database has also been established by STA to share the SRF data with the IMF’s Middle East and
Central Asia Department. The CBA also produces the financial soundness indicator table every
month, published on both the IMF and CBA websites.
External sector statistics
10.
In 2009, the Armenian authorities decided to transfer the responsibility for compiling
the balance of payments, international investment position (IIP), and external debt statistics
from the NSS to the CBA. The February 2010 STA mission provided advice on an action plan aimed
at ensuring a smooth institutional transfer of responsibility, as well as consistency and continuity in
the production of the external sector statistics. The responsibilities of compiling external sector
statistics were de facto transferred to the CBA in January 2011, and since then, the CBA has compiled
balance of payments, external debt, and IIP data for 2011. The transfer of responsibilities was
smooth and during the short period after the transfer, the CBA undertook a number of important
actions aimed at improving the compilation system. A follow up IMF STA mission in October 2011
undertook a comprehensive assessment of the institutional arrangements, data sources,
methodology, and compilation practices for external sector statistics employed by the CBA, and
advised on areas for improvement including further developing data sources and compilation
practices.
11.
The coverage of external sector data has improved in recent years. Trade statistics are
provided on a timely basis, and trade data by origin, destination, and commodity are generally
available within a month. Price data for exports and imports are less readily available. Quarterly
balance of payments statistics are generally available with a three-month lag. However, for
remittances, there are considerable discrepancies among available source data. Remittance data
obtained from surveys are considerably lower than data obtained through the money transfer
system. The absence of a comprehensive, continuously updated business register hampers the
coverage of transactions and institutional units; in particular, the coverage of the financial account
items for the private nonbank sector. There are also concerns with regard to the collection of data
on international trade in services, specifically on import of services. The CBA is currently considering

16

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

the implementation of an international transactions reporting system that would allow for collecting
data on all cross-border payments and receipts going through the banking system.
12.
Quarterly data on the international investment position are published by the CBA
within one quarter after the reference period, and the annual data within two quarters; and
are also provided for publication in IFS.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND FIRST REVIEW UNDER THE EXTENDED
ARRANGEMENT—SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION,
SUPPLEMENTARY LETTER OF INTENT
Approved By:

Juha Kähkönen (MCD) and Ranil Salgado (SPR)

This supplement updates the staff report and the staff appraisal.

Developments
1.
Pressures in the foreign exchange (FX) market have continued, and
monetary conditions have tightened. The dram continued to come under pressure in
late November and early December, largely reflecting developments in Russia, including
further depreciation of the ruble, and affecting remittances and exports. The Central
Bank of Armenia (CBA) moved to stem these pressures through large, intermittent FX
market interventions, including sales of $33 million during the week of November 24–28
and $63 million during the week of December 1–5. The US$-dram exchange rate (ER)
moved from AMD 415 per dollar in mid-November to AMD 447.86 per dollar on
December 5, and net international reserves (NIR) of the CBA reached $760 million, well
below the end-December target. In addition, the CBA tightened dram liquidity
conditions by increasing the Lombard rate for repo transactions from 8.25 percent to
10.25 percent in late November, and further to 21 percent in early December. As a result,
interest rates on the overnight market jumped from 7.0 percent to 10.3 percent during
the week of November 24–28, and subsequently to over 20 percent during the week of
December 1–5.
2.
The authorities have taken specific actions to adjust FX and monetary
policies, in order to limit further ad hoc intervention and allow the dram to move
to a new equilibrium ER. These actions aim to address what now appear to be more
than temporary pressures. On December 8, the authorities began conducting pre-

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

announced daily FX auctions of up to a specific maximum amount that aims not to meet
market demand, but rather to provide limited liquidity to help with price discovery.1 The daily
maximum is moderate and sustainable, initially $6 million per day for the first week, and
declining significantly each week to less than $1 million daily in the fourth week. On the first 5
days of auctions, $6 million were sold each day, with bids amounting to approximately $20
million per day and a tightening of spreads among bids. The weighted average auction ER has
moved each day, reaching AMD 470.22 per dollar on December 12. The difference between
dollar sales and dollar purchase volumes of banks outside of the auction has narrowed. The
authorities expect to maintain their efforts to limit dram liquidity for the time being, until
conditions strengthen and there are clear signs that inflation remains anchored. Even with the
programmed maximum intervention, reserve levels would still be adequate based on standard
import and debt metrics, as well as the IMF’s composite metric (see figure).
3.
The auctions were pre-announced to market participants and the public and will
cap further FX sales through end-December, although CBA purchases are also possible.
The auction schedule will cap further sales at approximately $65 million through year-end.
However, if demand is less than the daily maximum, the CBA will sell fewer dollars. Also, the
CBA is expecting inflows in December of over $90 million, including disbursements from
official financing. The CBA may also be in a position to reverse its FX interventions and
purchase dollars from the market, as the end of the calendar year is a time of seasonal FX
sales, as firms and individuals convert dollars to pay taxes and make other end-year
transactions, including related to the holidays. The CBA and the government have stepped up
communications, with an interview by the Deputy Prime Minister on the actions on December
7 and a press conference by the CBA Chairman on December 9.
4.
The authorities intend to limit FX sales in 2015. The proposed end-March 2015
indicative target and end-June 2015 performance criterion on CBA NIR have not been
adjusted. These targets built in modest CBA market sales The authorities consider that the
targets are ambitious in light of the recent FX sales. However, the movement of the dram to a
new equilibrium level and enhanced ER flexibility should support the return to more normal
market conditions and the rebuilding of buffers. In a supplementary letter of intent, the
authorities have reiterated their readiness to adjust monetary and exchange policies—as well
as other policies—as needed.

Staff Appraisal

1

Staff assessed the CBA’s multiple-price FX auction to be a multiple currency practice (MCP) as there was no
mechanism in place to prevent spreads between the rates of winning bids from exceeding 2 percent. The
authorities have since adopted a provision to prevent spreads of more than 2 percent between the rates of
winning bids in the auction, based on which staff has found the MCP to be eliminated. As the overall auction
framework was in place prior to approval of the Extended Arrangement, the finding of the MCP (since
eliminated) has no impact on the continuous performance criterion on introduction or modification of MCPs.

2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

5.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ move to put in place a clear, transparent, and
sustainable FX framework in the face of market pressures. These pressures emanate in
large part from external developments that are expected to be more than temporary. The
changes were well communicated, and the authorities have demonstrated their commitment
to limiting FX auctions to the daily maximum, in order to establish credibility of the new
approach. This has provided a clear cap on CBA intervention, helping the market find a new
equilibrium ER, and fostering sales of FX by banks, exporters, and others. The new ER should
facilitate external adjustment and improve competitiveness.
6.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ commitments to limit FX sales in 2015, rebuild
buffers, and further adjust policies as needed. The authorities are to be commended for
limiting intervention and strengthening communications and guidance to market participants.
These should continue when there are seasonal FX demands. The steps to tighten liquidity
should be reversed when pressures have abated. The recently activated auction system
provides a framework for managing exchange rate pressures and preventing ad hoc
interventions. The auction could also be used to rebuild buffers in 2015, for example, by
providing a mechanism for daily FX purchases. As the dram adjustment and the increase of
interest rates—combined with slowing growth—could have implications for the banking
sector, the authorities should continue to monitor the situation closely, with frequent stress
testing and contingency plans in place. If pressures continue, a tightening of monetary and
fiscal policies may be needed.
7.
Challenges are likely to continue. The authorities have rightly noted that the period
ahead is expected to be characterized by continued uncertainty and volatility, including in the
oil markets and the regional geopolitical context. The policy framework of a low fiscal deficit,
reinforced exchange rate flexibility, sound buffers, and growth enhancing reforms is
appropriate, although as indicated in the staff appraisal, more ER flexibility and decisive
structural reform implementation would be desirable.
8.

Staff continues to support the conclusion of the First Review.

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

Republic of Armenia—Supplementary Letter of Intent
First Review Under the Extended Arrangement
Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431

Yerevan, December 15, 2014

Dear Madam Lagarde:
This letter supplements the letter of intent (LOI) for the First Review Under the Extended
Arrangement of December 3, 2014.
1.
Pressures in the foreign exchange (FX) market have continued, and monetary
conditions have tightened. The dram has continued to come under pressure in late November
and early December, mainly reflecting developments in Russia and depreciation of the ruble. The
Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) has moved to stem these pressures by selling FX and
simultaneously allowing the exchange rate of the dram to adjust. Monetary conditions have also
tightened, including the rate for access to the Lombard facility and overnight interest rates. Still,
pressures remain, and sizeable FX sales have continued. Timely actions are needed to address
what appear to be more than temporary pressures, to limit further CBA intervention, and to allow
the exchange rate of the dram to move to a new equilibrium.
2.
Accordingly, we have adjusted our FX and monetary policies. From December 8, we
began conducting pre-announced daily auctions of dollars up to a specific maximum amount
that does not aim to meet recent market demand in full, but rather to help with price discovery.
The maximum daily amount is limited, moderate, and sustainable—initially $6 million per day for
the first week. We have indicated in public announcements that the amount will be significantly
reduced each week. New specific daily maximum sales amounts will be preannounced for each
week, declining to $1 million or less in the fourth week. We will strictly limit sales to the
maximum daily amount to establish credibility of the new approach; foster sales of FX by banks,
exporters, and others; cap the potential maximum amount of CBA intervention; and support the
market in finding a new equilibrium rate. We recognize that the market may well temporarily
overshoot, and we are prepared for this. If demand is less than the daily maximum amount, the
CBA will sell less. Moreover, the CBA may be in a position to recoup its FX intervention, including
by using the auction mechanism for purchases; the end of the calendar year is a time of seasonal
FX sales as firms and individuals convert dollars to pay taxes or make other end-year transactions
and reflecting holiday-related FX flows.
3.
Recent efforts to limit dram liquidity will be maintained, but these could be eased
as conditions strengthen and as there are clear signs that inflation remains anchored. This
statement updates ¶16 of the December 3 LOI, which described the monetary policy easing cycle
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA

that began in November 2013 and suggested that the CBA may pursue further easing if
conditions warrant.
4.
We intend to continue to limit FX sales in 2015. We have not requested modification
of the proposed end-March 2015 indicative target or the end-June 2015 performance criterion
on CBA NIR that we agreed with the Fund staff in the context of the First Review discussions
(Table 1 of the December 3, 2014 LOI). The targets built in modest first quarter CBA sales to the
market ($30 million) reflecting seasonal demand patterns, including for example, for payment of
energy imports during the winter. While the targets are ambitious in light of the recent
developments and FX sales, we consider that the movement of the dram to a new equilibrium
exchange rate should support the return to more normal FX market conditions and provide
opportunities to rebuild buffers and meet the agreed targets, and stand ready to adjust other
policies as well as needed. At the same time, we are mindful that the period ahead is likely to be
characterized by continued uncertainty and volatility, including in the oil markets and in the
regional geopolitical context.
5.
We authorize the IMF to publish this Supplementary Letter of Intent and the
accompanying staff report supplement.

Very truly yours,

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 30, 2014

700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Completes First Review under the Extended Arrangement,
Approves US$17 Million Disbursement, and Concludes 2014 Article IV
Consultation with Armenia
On December 22, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
completed the first review of Armenia’s economic performance under a three-year program
supported by the extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF). The completion
of the first review enables the release of SDR 11.74 million (about US$17 million), bringing
total disbursements under the arrangement to SDR 23.48 million (about US$34 million). The
extended arrangement for SDR 82.21 million (about US$119.1 million was approved on
March 7, 2014 (see Press Release No. 14/88) In addition, the Executive Board concluded
the 2014 Article IV consultation1 with Armenia and endorsed the staff appraisal without a
meeting on a lapse-of-time basis.2
After a steady recovery during 2010–12 from the deep 2009 recession, Armenia’s growth
softened in 2013 and has remained subdued in 2014. The softening of economic activity has been
broad based, as growth of exports and remittances slowed, and government spending was lower
than budgeted. Construction, which had declined since the 2009 crisis, was relatively flat.
Growth is projected at 2.6 percent in 2014 and is expected to increase only gradually in 2015 and
over the medium term in light of expectations of slow growth in key trading partners. In line with
the subdued economic activity, inflation fell during the year below the Central Bank of
Armenia’s (CBA) target range (4±1.5 percent) but is expected to return to that range, as the
recent depreciation of the dram pushes the price of imported goods up.
In the context of regional developments, pressures in the foreign exchange (FX) market emerged
in early 2014 and reemerged in late November due to further depreciation of the Russian ruble.
The CBA moved to stem these pressures by allowing some depreciation of the dram in line with
changes in economic fundamentals, but also increasing its FX supply to the market. On
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.
2
The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse-of-time procedure when the Board agrees that a proposal can
be considered without convening formal discussions.

2
December 8th the CBA activated pre-announced daily FX auctions to help ensure smooth
functioning of the FX market. The CBA also tightened dram liquidity conditions by increasing
the Lombard rate for repo transactions to 21 percent in early December. As a result, interest rates
on the overnight market jumped to over 20 percent from December 1–5. International reserve
levels are adequate based on standard import and debt metrics. Reserves also continue to
compare well with peer countries.
The banking sector remains sound, but performance has been weakening amid challenging
economic conditions. In particular, bank profitability has declined as weaker economic growth
has been accompanied by an increase in non-performing loans (NPLs), which reached
6.5 percent in September, and as credit and deposits growth have slowed. The recent tightening
of domestic liquidity conditions and FX developments may also put pressure on bank profits
going forward. The CBA has continued to monitor financial sector developments closely, and the
robust capitalization of the banking sector constitutes an important cushion.
The fiscal deficit is expected to reach 1.5 percent of GDP in 2014, well below the budget
(2.3 percent of GDP). This reflects capital under-spending (especially in the multi-donor NorthSouth Highway), lower-than-budgeted matching pension contributions (due to pension reform
changes), and less spending on goods and services. Despite lower growth, revenues have been
close to budget targets so far this year, and even amid regional uncertainties, Eurobond spreads
have remained stable.
The authorities’ policies remain geared toward maintaining macroeconomic stability and
fostering sustainable and inclusive growth. The CBA continues to conduct monetary policy
under an inflation targeting framework, accompanied by exchange rate flexibility, and to
implement policies aimed at maintaining and strengthening financial sector stability. Fiscal
policy remains focused on keeping the deficit and debt at manageable levels, while augmenting
growth-enhancing expenditures and strengthening social protection. In addition, the authorities
are pursuing a structural reform agenda to foster growth. On October 10, the presidents of
Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia signed an agreement on Armenia’s membership in the
Eurasian Economic Union (EEU). Armenia is expected to formally join the Union in January,
once the treaty is ratified by the four national parliaments.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2014 Article IV consultation with Armenia, Executive Directors endorsed the
staff appraisal in the staff report as follows:
Armenia faces a period of slower growth unless decisive actions are taken. Sound
macroeconomic policies since the crisis have helped sustain domestic and external stability in a
highly uncertain context. However, going forward, projected growth rates will not be sufficient
to generate sufficient jobs and stem emigration. Sluggish investment in recent years, a still-weak

3
business climate, and the absence of strong growth drivers constrain the capacity of the economy
to generate sufficient jobs to stem emigration and reduce poverty. EEU membership could help
increase exports to the large EEU market, but medium-term growth prospects for Russia are
modest as well. Therefore, more decisive implementation of reforms, as anchored in the Fundsupported program, is needed to reduce vulnerabilities and boost potential growth.
Performance has moderated due to both domestic and regional factors. Growth is
expected to slow to 2.6 percent of GDP in 2014 from 3.5 percent in 2013, while inflation has
fallen below the CBA’s target range. Growth of exports and remittances has weakened, but
slower growth of imports meant that the FX market remained relatively stable through much
of 2014, although pressures emerged in November-December. The banking sector remains well
capitalized and liquid, but weakening conditions have been associated with an increase in nonperforming loans (NPLs). On a brighter note, while the slowdown has been broadly based,
agriculture and tourism are benefitting from investment and structural reforms and are growing
at a healthy pace.
Vulnerabilities remain high. While international reserves are adequate, the consolidation of
the external current account deficit has slowed in 2014 due to lower-than-expected exports and
remittances. Staff estimates that an adjustment of the real exchange rate over the medium term
would help facilitate further external adjustment and improve competitiveness. However, the
banking system is still highly dollarized, which could imply pressures on bank balance sheets if a
disorderly external adjustment occurs.
Armenia faces a high degree of risk. Growth is projected to pick up to 3.3 percent of GDP
in 2015, in the context of supportive macroeconomic policies—notably, monetary policy easing
in 2013–14 and stronger capital budget execution. However, the short-term outlook is subject to
a high degree of uncertainty, especially given regional geopolitical developments and tensions.
An intensification of these would lead to further negative spillovers to Armenia’s economy.
The authorities should create fiscal space to boost social and investment spending
over the medium term. Efforts should focus on revenues, as underexecution of capital spending
has had a negative impact on growth, although staff commends the authorities for not diverting
spending into low pay-off areas and welcomes efforts to assess and address reasons for
underspending. With lower growth, available financing, and few risks to inflation or
sustainability, staff sees merit in a higher deficit in the 2015 budget, with increased spending
going to capital outlays. Staff has long pressed for higher tax revenues to support higher social
spending and growth-enhancing infrastructure projects. Tax measures should also aim to
improve the tax system by eliminating gaps and ensuring greater equity. The upcoming
formulation of a comprehensive tax code is an opportunity to broaden the tax base and
rationalize exemptions and tax expenditures. EEU common customs pool revenues could provide
a further opportunity to build fiscal buffers through savings. However, the revenues must be
secured and in any event are transitory, as EEU tariffs are expected to decline over the medium-

4
term. Staff commends the authorities’ cautious approach in evaluating the sustainability of these
additional revenues, prior to incorporating them in the budget framework.
Further strengthening of monetary and financial sector policies should remain a priority, building
on recent progress. The CBA’s Inflation-Forecast Targeting (IFT) framework has served
Armenia well and remains an appropriate anchor for monetary policy. Nonetheless, the
effectiveness of the IFT framework should be further strengthened by reducing dollarization,
improving monetary policy instruments, and enhancing the CBA’s communication and modeling
capabilities. Similarly, the CBA has made noteworthy progress in implementing
recommendations of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and Basel III guidance,
while strengthening financial sector regulation and resilience. However, further work is needed
to incorporate new guidance on large exposures and liquidity requirements, as well as to revisit
the dedollarization strategy, and to foster better financial intermediation via improved legislation
on registration and execution of collateral.
Exchange rate policy should support external adjustment. The current situation poses challenges
to exchange rate policy, notably the recent depreciation of the Russian ruble, uncertainty
surrounding regional geopolitical events, and pressures to calm what are perceived as disorderly
conditions in a thin market. While limited interventions to mitigate disorderly conditions are
warranted, pressures that reflect economic fundamentals should be accommodated. Enhanced
central bank communications will be important to provide clarity and guidance. Maintaining
robust buffers, together with flexibility of the dram, should support further reduction of the
external current account deficit to its sustainable level.
The authorities should implement ambitious reforms to bolster potential growth and promote
inclusion. The successful implementation of “open skies” in civil aviation is a good example of
how bold policy decisions can have positive results in a relatively short period of time. Recent
delays in implementation of reforms in the competition and regulatory areas, while relatively
minor, should be reversed. The reform agenda should be implemented decisively to improve
Armenia’s capacity to grow, create jobs, and reduce poverty. Business environment reforms
should overcome long-standing concerns about uneven competition, unnecessary regulation,
high costs, and skills shortages and mismatches. The authorities should move quickly to bolster
the pension reform and ensure its long-run success. Reforms in the energy sector should be
compatible with long-term fiscal sustainability, involve the private sector, and be transparent and
cost-effective, while mitigating the impact on the poor. Finally, the authorities should leverage
EEU membership to increase exports, improve standards, enhance domestic competition, and
invest in infrastructure. They should also pursue deeper integration beyond the EEU to enhance
growth prospects and reduce vulnerabilities.
Policies under the program remain on track. All performance criteria and most indicative targets
were met. Competition and regulatory reforms have advanced at a slower-than-expected pace,
causing delays in meeting structural benchmarks, mainly due to the government change in mid2014 rather than a change in policy direction. Going forward, the program will accommodate a
modest fiscal stimulus in 2015, while maintaining macroeconomic stability and fiscal

5
sustainability. The Net International Reserves (NIR) targets will help maintain strong buffers.
Structural benchmarks for the remainder of 2014 and first half of 2015 are focused on core areas,
including tax administration, Public Financial Management (PFM), financial sector development,
and central bank operations.
Risks to the program are significant, but manageable, and Armenia’s repayment capacity remains
robust. While the short-term outlook is subject to a high degree of uncertainty, and Armenia is
vulnerable to geopolitical developments, the authorities have a strong track record of sound
macroeconomic policies and program implementation. A low fiscal deficit, moderate public debt,
broadly adequate reserves, and growth-supporting reforms embedded in the program reinforce
this assessment. Staff supports the authorities’ request for the equivalent of SDR 11.74 million to
become available with the completion of the first review.
In addition, the Executive Board endorsed the staff appraisal of the staff supplement as follows:
Staff welcomes the authorities’ move to put in place a clear, transparent, and sustainable FX
framework in the face of market pressures. These pressures emanate in large part from external
developments that are expected to be more than temporary, calling for ER adjustment. The
changes were well communicated, and the authorities have demonstrated their commitment to
limiting FX auctions to the daily maximum, in order to establish credibility of the new approach.
This has provided a clear cap on CBA intervention, helping the market find a new equilibrium
ER, and fostering sales of FX by banks, exporters, and others. The new ER should facilitate
external adjustment and improve competitiveness.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ commitments to limit FX sales in 2015, rebuild buffers, and
further adjust policies as needed. The authorities are to be commended for limiting intervention
and strengthening communications and guidance to market participants. The steps to tighten
liquidity should be reversed when pressures have abated. The recently activated auction system
provides a framework for managing exchange rate pressures and preventing ad hoc interventions.
The auction could also be used to rebuild buffers in 2015, for example, by providing a
mechanism for daily FX purchases. As the dram adjustment and the increase of interest rates—
combined with slowing growth—could have implications for the banking sector, the authorities
should continue to monitor the situation closely, with frequent stress testing and contingency
plans in place. If pressures continue, a tightening of monetary and fiscal policies may be needed.
Challenges are likely to continue. The authorities have rightly noted that the period ahead is
expected to be characterized by continued uncertainty and volatility, including in the oil markets
and the regional geopolitical context. The policy framework of a low fiscal deficit, reinforced
exchange rate flexibility, sound buffers, and growth enhancing reforms is appropriate, although
as indicated in the staff appraisal, more ER flexibility and decisive structural reform
implementation would be desirable.
Staff continues to support the conclusion of the First Review.

Sources: Armenian authorities; and Fund staff estimates and projections.
1/ From 2013, tax revenue includes social contribution.
2/ In 2013 includes 1.5 percent of GDP related to the acquisition by Gazprom from the government of 20 percent
of the shares of ArmRusGazprom, and the transfer (expenditure) of the same amount from the government to
ArmRusGazprom to liquidate liabilities. A surplus of 0.6 percent of GDP is obtained when this transaction is excluded.
3/ In 2013, a credit for $155 million is registered in FDI to reflect the acquisition by Gazprom of 20 percent
of the shares of ArmRusGazprom, while an offseting debit is registered in other capital (net) to reflect the
corresponding reduction in liabilities of the latter with the former.
4/ Based on public and publicly-guaranteed debt.
5/ Gross international reserves in months of next year's imports of goods and services, including the SDR holdings.
6/ A positive sign denotes appreciation.
