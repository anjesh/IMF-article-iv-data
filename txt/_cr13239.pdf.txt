STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Economic context. The non-oil economy has been gathering strength amid favorable
oil prices and capital inflows. The real estate market has started to recover from the 2009
crisis, in some segments rapidly, and there have been a number of announcements of
new megaprojects in real estate and tourism. Growth in oil production will likely slow in
the context of an amply supplied global oil market.
Policy Focus. In this environment, economic and financial policies should focus on
measures that will help prevent a renewed cycle of exuberant risk-taking and strengthen
the fiscal position, while completing the agenda of dealing with the legacy of the 2009
crisis by continuing the deleveraging and restructuring of government-related entities
(GRE).
Macroeconomic policy mix. The UAE plans for continued fiscal consolidation this year
at an appropriate pace, helping to further unwind the fiscal stimulus of recent years
without undermining the economic recovery. Medium-term fiscal plans point to further
consolidation. Monetary policy is expected to stay accommodative under the U.S. dollar
peg.
GREs. Building on progress in restructuring the debt of GREs, Dubai should continue to
focus on strengthening the GRE sector. This should include proactive management of
upcoming debt maturities and improving the GREs’ transparency and governance. The
new megaprojects should be executed at a measured pace, and new risk-taking by GREs
should be avoided.
Financial stability. The banking system maintains significant capital and liquidity
buffers. To preempt the build-up of new vulnerabilities, swift implementation of the
planned new prudential regulations for mortgage lending and loan concentration will be
important. This will mitigate the risk of rapid credit expansion and undue concentration
of loans to the real estate and GRE sectors in the future. Mortgage lending rules could
be complemented by targeted increases in real estate-related fees, should housing price
increases continue unabated.

BACKGROUND
1.
The UAE has profited from its safe-haven status amid the political and social unrest
that has been sweeping through the MENA region. Against a backdrop of political stability,
confidence has further increased, tourism has been firm, demand from expatriates from the broader
region has increased, and capital inflows have strengthened amid high global liquidity. The real
estate sector, which had been impaired since the 2009 crisis, has stabilized in Abu Dhabi and started
to recover in Dubai.
2.
The economic diversification drive is gathering further steam. Dubai aims to build on its
early achievements in becoming a hub for retail and wholesale trade, as well as a major tourism and
real estate investment destination for the wider region, and recently announced plans for several
new megaprojects in real estate and tourism. Dubai is a candidate city for the World Expo 2020, and
if it succeeds in its bid, the implementation of many of these plans will likely accelerate. While Abu
Dhabi continues to expand its hydrocarbon production capacity, the emirate is actively pursuing an
economic diversification strategy that relies primarily on petrochemicals, financial services, aviation,
renewable energy, and cultural tourism.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
3.
The economic recovery continued in 2012, supported by favorable oil prices. Economic
growth is estimated to have reached 4.3 percent in 2012. Oil production expanded by 5.2 percent,
and non-oil growth, driven primarily by growth in the services sectors, continued to accelerate to
3.8 percent. The real estate market, which had been a drag on growth since the 2009 crisis, began an
uneven recovery (Box 1). Inflation remained subdued at 0.7 percent on average, in light of a stilldeclining rent component and limited pass-through of international food prices.

The external position strengthened further. Backed by high oil prices and production, and
by buoyant nonhydrocarbon exports, the external current account surplus reached almost
17 percent of GDP in 2012. Dubai’s non-hydrocarbon exports, in particular, recorded high growth
rates, despite a significant decline in bilateral trade with Iran (down by 31 percent in 2012). Capital

inflows also strengthened, with corporates and banks having been active in issuing conventional
debt and sukuk throughout the year, taking advantage of falling risk premia, particularly for Dubai.
Gross foreign inflows to the banking sector also remained steady, reflecting the UAE’s perceived
safe-haven status and a modest interest rate differential with international rates. As a consequence,
central bank reserves increased markedly and reached $47 billion in 2012, covering 3.3 months
of imports (net of re-exports), just over half of short-term debt, or 20 percent of M2. While
substantially below the range suggested by the Fund’s new reserve adequacy metric1
($82-123 billion), central bank reserves are small relative to foreign assets in sovereign wealth funds,
which are mandated to make resources available in case of need and have a sufficiently liquid
portfolio to do so. As a result, external buffers appear adequate.
Box 1. Real Estate Market Developments
The UAE real estate market is in a phase of uneven recovery. Residential real estate prices in Dubai have been
rising substantially, while other market segments, especially office space, are recovering at a slower pace. The
recovery in the Abu Dhabi real estate market has been lagging.
The recovery in Dubai is largely concentrated in high-quality residential properties, helped by robust non-oil

The banking system is sound, but nonperforming loans (NPLs) remain high and
lending to the private sector continues to be sluggish. While NPLs have begun declining from
their high of December 2012, to 8.3 percent (12.6 percent in Dubai) in March 2013, there is still some
divergence among banks in the recognition of NPLs on restructured loans and provisioning
practices. UAE banks started

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
7.
Non-oil growth is expected to strengthen further in 2013. A broadening recovery in
construction and real estate, and ongoing growth in tourism-oriented sectors are likely to underpin
non-oil growth, which could reach 4.3 percent this year. Growth in oil production will likely slow to
around 2 percent in 2013 after two years of substantial expansion, as growth in global oil demand
remains weak amid expanding global supply (Box 2). Inflation could pick up somewhat this year to
around 2 percent as the housing market continues its recovery. The external current account surplus
is projected to remain high at around 15 percent, supported by high oil prices and strong
nonhydrocarbon exports and re-exports.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES

8.
Medium-term growth and diversification prospects are promising. Based on Dubai’s
further expansion plans in its core services sectors and Abu Dhabi’s intensified diversification efforts,
non-hydrocarbon growth is expected to remain strong at above 4 percent in the medium term.
9.
Downside risks to this outlook have declined over the past year but remain substantial
(see risk assessment matrix and Box 3). Domestically, a key medium-term risk is related to a possible
renewed building up of a boom-and-bust cycle in light of the recovering real estate market and the
announcement of new megaprojects. On the external side, a major downside risk is the possibility of
an abrupt reversal of capital inflows, which could be triggered, for example, by monetary policy
tightening in the United States or a re-emergence of global financial stress. This could affect
rollovers or raise borrowing costs for banks (though these maintain large liquidity buffers), GREs,
private borrowers, and government. Another downside risk is a deeper than expected economic
slowdown in emerging markets, particularly in Asia, reflecting the UAE’s close links with international
financial markets and emerging Asian economies. If adverse external developments trigger a large
and prolonged decline in hydrocarbon prices, it would ultimately result in reduced fiscal spending
and non-hydrocarbon GDP growth and could expose weaknesses in the balance sheets of GREs and
other companies. That said, the UAE’s substantial foreign assets and improving fiscal position
provide insulation against moderate or short-lived shocks.
10.
There are also a number of upside risks to the outlook. A faster recovery in the advanced
economies would have a positive effect on global growth and oil prices. More generally, higher oil
prices would further support fiscal revenues and the external current account, as long as oil exports
are not disrupted and confidence is maintained. Adequate macroeconomic policies and borrowing
restraint by GREs in the currently favorable economic conditions can support high and sustainable
economic growth without incurring undue macroeconomic risks.

Box 2. Hydrocarbon Sector Outlook
Global oil demand is expected to remain sluggish over the next few years amid ample
global oil supply. Global oil consumption grew by about 1 percent in 2012 and is projected by
major energy agencies to increase at a similar rate this year, in light of weak economic activity and
decreasing oil demand in the advanced economies, and slightly lower growth in emerging
markets. Global demand is

In this environment, the UAE’s oil production capacity is expected to rise substantially in
the medium term. The UAE’s oil output grew by 2½ percent year-on-year in Q1 2013, and output
growth for 2013 is expected to continue at a similar pace (2 percent). Regarding the medium term,
the UAE is second to Iraq among Gulf oil producers regarding plans for extending production
capacity, which could reach 3½ mbd by 2018 according to the authorities’ plans (the upcoming
renewal of legacy concession contracts could pose risks to this timeline). In light of the wellsupplied global oil market, staff’s projections of UAE hydrocarbon GDP growth allow for a slight
fall in capacity utilization.

Box 3. Quantifying the External Risks to the UAE Outlook
While it is inherently difficult to quantify the external risks to the UAE’s outlook, scenario analysis can
shed light on the potential magnitude of effects on the UAE of key external risk factors.
A deeper than expected slowdown in emerging markets. If investment by the BRICS (Brazil,
Russia, India, China, and South Africa) slows significantly, accompanied by tighter financial
conditions, their output loss could exceed 4 percent in the first year. The slowdown could reduce
global output by about 1 percent and oil prices by about $20 in the first year, keeping Brent below
$90 until at least 2017.1 The associated GCC output loss is estimated at ¾ percent in the first year
(higher if expenditure is cut on account of lower oil revenues) and could persist for many years.2
BRICS account for a quarter of the UAE’s non-oil exports, a share dominated by sales to India, and
the UAE would be materially affected. The UAE’s fiscal surplus would reach a low of 2½ percent in
2014 (on unchanged policies). In addition, a slowdown of capital flows to emerging markets would
affect prospects for debt refinancing.
A global re-emergence of financial stress associated with slow progress on euro area policy
commitments. Such a scenario could result in a fall in energy prices ($4 in 2014) and global GDP
(by less than ¼ percent in the first year).1 IMF estimates imply that the impact on GCC GDP would
be of a similar magnitude,2 though possibly higher in the UAE because of its financial exposures.
Higher interest rates and/or retrenched global financing would make it harder and more costly to
roll over maturing debt. Foreign claims by global banks on the UAE, two-thirds of which are of
European origin, are US$142 billion according to BIS data. The banking system would have enough
liquidity to withstand substantial withdrawals, though a few banks that rely on foreign wholesale
funding might face liquidity pressures. GREs, private borrowers, and the government could face
higher borrowing costs, and some weaker entities may find it difficult to roll over their maturing
debt.
Fall in oil revenues due to a large and prolonged global slowdown or expanding global
supply. Pricing in the uncertainties related to global oil demand and supply, options markets imply
a one standard deviation risk (about one-in-six chance) that oil prices will be $21 below the baseline
in mid-2014 and $30 below the baseline by mid-2015. Hydrocarbons account for over half of UAE
goods exports (excluding re-exports) and 80 percent of government revenue. Were oil prices to fall
$30 below baseline for a prolonged period, fiscal surpluses would erode, with a deficit of 3 percent
of GDP by 2018 on unchanged policies, higher if countercyclical policies are implemented. In
addition, if hydrocarbon production were to fall in response to a potentially lower call on OPEC
supply, this would further reduce hydrocarbon revenues.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
In the context of a strengthening economic recovery, quickly rising real estate prices in
some market segments, and newly announced megaprojects in real estate and tourism,
discussions focused on policies to strengthen fiscal and external buffers, bolster the GRE
and financial sectors, and minimize the risk of entering a renewed boom/bust cycle, while
continuing to focus on managing the legacy of the 2009 crisis by continuing the
deleveraging and restructuring of GREs.

A. Correcting Imbalances while Supporting the Economy
11.
The authorities plan for continued fiscal consolidation in 2013. The combined budgets
of the federal and emirate governments indicate a consolidation of the fiscal stance by around
2 percent of nonhydrocarbon GDP, driven by continued consolidation in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. The
fiscal consolidation is expected to be achieved by a rationalization of capital spending and subsidies
and transfers, while spending on goods and services, defense and security, and the wage bill are
expected to increase. A notable increase in development spending is a large affordable housing
program in Abu Dhabi which will be offset by cuts in other capital spending including loans and
equity. Dubai scaled down its development spending last year after completing a series of important
infrastructure projects and intends to cut overall spending in 2013, except for an increase in wages
and salaries.
12.
The pace of continued fiscal correction remains appropriate. Staff’s fiscal sustainability
analysis based on the permanent income hypothesis indicates that the UAE’s fiscal deficit exceeds
levels consistent with

Long-term sustainability here assumes intergenerational equity by calculating a constant real per capita
government spending path (and related non-oil deficit) that delivers a constant real per capita annuity to finance
government spending after hydrocarbon revenues are exhausted. Results are highly sensitive to assumptions,
particularly the interest rate and inflation.

to a marked decline in oil prices. At the same time, the recovery in the non-oil economy has gained
momentum and is unlikely to be undermined by the planned pace of withdrawal of fiscal stimulus.
13.
Medium-term fiscal plans point to further consolidation. Both Abu Dhabi and Dubai
target continued gradual consolidation in their non-oil balances through 2017, further correcting for
the UAE’s long-term intergenerational fiscal imbalances, reducing oil-price related risks, and, in the
case of Dubai, addressing debt-related concerns. Fiscal consolidation will be driven by restraint in
capital expenditure in the context of solid economic growth. It should also be supported by
reductions in energy subsidies, which would create fiscal space while improving energy efficiency.
Moreover, limiting further wage bill increases would support the objectives of maintaining flexibility
of the budget and making private sector employment more attractive for nationals. Over the
medium- to long-term, efforts should focus on returning the fiscal stance to levels consistent with
intergenerational equity. At the emirate level, a faster pace of consolidation in Dubai would be
desirable to address the emirate’s continued debt-related risks, as indicated by the debt
sustainability analysis (Box 4). In Abu Dhabi, planned cuts in subsidies and transfers in 2013 should
be sustained in the period ahead.
14.
Ensuring the long-term sustainability of Dubai’s public finances would require efforts
to secure a stable and buoyant revenue base. Dubai’s non-hydrocarbon revenues amounted to a
mere 5½ percent of GDP in 2012. Currently, the government of Dubai has no plans to implement
income or corporate taxes, and the timing of the GCC-wide initiative of introducing a VAT is
uncertain. Targeted increases in real estate-related fees from the current level of 2 percent could be
considered, particularly if risks of overheating in the real estate market rise, which would help
mitigate risks of a renewed real estate bubble while generating revenue in support of the emirate’s
ongoing fiscal consolidation.5 The government of Dubai indicated that fee increases (or the
introduction of new fees) could affect the emirate’s competitiveness, and would thus likely only be
considered in coordination with other emirates and the federal government.
15.
The introduction of a medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF) can help secure effective
implementation of the UAE’s fiscal policy objectives and enhance fiscal coordination.
A medium-term planning horizon is particularly important to prevent volatile oil revenues from
translating into expenditure fluctuations that can destabilize the economy and reduce the quality of
government spending. The federal government, Dubai, and Abu Dhabi have all made progress in
developing MTFFs. The federal government adopted a medium-term budget in line with the federal
strategy to set future budget priorities. Abu Dhabi has been making progress in developing
analytical capacity for MTFF to inform policy decision making, while Dubai implements a three-year
budget framework to guide the budgeting process. Based on these achievements, the authorities
should continue to refine their MTFFs, and, in the case of Abu Dhabi, increasingly integrate its MTFF
into the budget formulation process.
5

By way of comparison, in the context of a sharp run-up in real estate prices, Hong Kong SAR has increasingly
tightened its policies, and recently raised fees for properties resold within six months from 15 to 20 percent and
introduced a 5 percent fee for properties resold within two to three years. A 15 percent fee was introduced for buyers
who are not permanent residents.

Box 4. Dubai’s Debt Sustainability
The sustainability of Dubai government debt has improved with strengthening growth and progress in
fiscal consolidation. The government debt-to-GDP ratio has declined from its peak of 48 percent in 2009. The
baseline scenario assumes steady medium-term growth and a continuation of Dubai’s gradual fiscal
consolidation, with an almost balanced budget in 2014 in line with the authorities’ plans. This scenario shows a
steady decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio over the projection period.
Scenario analysis indicates that sever shocks can undermine debt sustainability. An initial sharp decline in
economic activity and a tepid recovery would raise the debt-to-GDP ratio by about 12 percentage points
compared to the baseline in
2018. Likewise, under a severe
global downturn scenario which

Monetary policy continues to support the U.S. dollar peg, which has served the UAE
well. The policy rate has been at 1 percent with a stable spread over the Fed funds rate since 2008
(Figure 1), and there are few near-term inflationary risks despite an expected pick-up in the housing
component of inflation. The real effective exchange rate (REER) depreciated slightly in 2012,
continuing a trend since 2009. Different methodologies yield mixed results for the exchange rate
assessment (Appendix 2). The projected current account balance of 7.4 percent for 2018 is close to
the estimate for the norm implied by the macrobalance approach (7 percent). The external
sustainability approach, which considers the level of imports consistent with intergenerational equity,
implies a need to accumulate further savings of about 9 percent of GDP in 2018. Since the
adjustment needs are centered on government rather than the private sector (see above),
adjustment should occur through fiscal consolidation rather than exchange rate devaluation. By
contrast, the equilibrium exchange rate approach indicates that the currency has not matched the
increase in oil prices since 2009, which implies moderate undervaluation under this model.

B. Managing Old and New Risks Stemming from GREs
17.
With GREs at the core of the 2009 crisis, ongoing focus on dealing with legacy issues
and on preventing new exuberant risk-taking is warranted.6 Dubai’s total debt continues to be
substantial at around $142 billion

confidence.

18.
Dubai’s ambitious expansion plans warrant measured execution amid strengthening
access to external financing. Dubai’s megaprojects will be executed to a large extent through
GREs. Although further investment in the development of Dubai’s economy is welcome, the
authorities should ensure that execution will be gradual and structured in a way that strictly limits
risk-taking by the still highly indebted GRE sector. This will help contain fiscal risks and reduce the
likelihood of another boom-bust cycle. Managing these risks thus calls for prioritizing and
sequencing major projects, assessing the quality of planned spending, and for improving the
framework to manage scrutiny, selection, delivery, and funding of major projects.
19.
Ongoing focus on improving the transparency of Dubai’s GREs will be important to
strengthen their resilience. Abu Dhabi has made notable progress in monitoring and
disseminating GRE debt and other financial data through its debt management office. Data
availability on financial conditions, debt stocks and maturity profiles of Dubai’s GREs, however,
continues to be inadequate for an assessment of the sector’s financial health and associated
macroeconomic risks. The Dubai government has created a dedicated team for government debt
and guarantee issuance. Building on this, Dubai should establish a full debt management office,
which would be tasked with implementing a proper risk management framework entailing effective
identification, assessment, monitoring, and reporting of contingent liabilities arising from GREs.
20.
Further strengthening the Dubai GREs’ corporate governance is also key. The Dubai
government has replaced many GRE boards of directors since the 2009 crisis, with representation of
key government officials on these boards, and introduced a requirement for approval by the
Supreme Fiscal Committee of any new GRE borrowing. Building on these improvements, key steps
for further strengthening the GRE’s corporate governance include (i) delineating clearly their
commercial and noncommercial operations; (ii) expanding the coverage of the 2009 corporate
governance code to public companies; (iii) strengthening the role and independence of company
boards to allow for more effective decision making; and (iv) improving risk management practices.
21.
The Dubai government emphasized that important lessons have been learnt from the
2009 crisis. While acknowledging that certain segments of the Dubai real estate market have been
recovering fast and that Dubai GREs have been regaining access to foreign funding, the Dubai
government stressed that the exuberance of the pre-crisis period that led to the previous boombust cycle is unlikely to return as the planned megaprojects will be executed in a gradual manner
over the medium- and long-term. Regarding Dubai’s debt, the Dubai authorities noted that, as in
the case of their January 2013 bond issuance, which pre-funded the 2013 government bond
maturities, they would continue to be proactive in debt refinancing, aiming to diversify funding
sources and to extend maturities by taking advantage of the low interest rate environment.

C. Financial Sector Soundness and Financial Spillovers
22.
The banking system maintains significant capital and liquidity buffers. While the level
of NPLs may have peaked, a potential further restructuring of GRE debt, including possibly on
already restructured debt, could still raise this level. Joint CBU/IMF staff stress tests show that the
domestic banking system could absorb even a significant increase in NPLs, with only a few banks
falling somewhat below the mandated minimum capital adequacy requirement in the event of an
extreme shock. Nonetheless, stricter recognition of NPLs and higher provisioning, particularly for
restructured loans, would further strengthen confidence in the banking system. Stress tests on nonresident liquidity withdrawal from the system further show that it would take a very large shock to
generate even a moderate systemic liquidity need, concentrated in a few banks, and still well within
banks’ holdings of CDs and reserves at the CBU.

23.
Shielding the banking system from concentration risk to the GRE and real estate
sectors is key. The UAE’s banks are strongly interconnected with GREs through ownership and
financial linkages. The interconnectedness, coupled with non-transparent corporate governance
structures and practices, makes managing the evolution of interconnected leverage challenging, and
could give rise to systemic risks. While GRE activities remain an integral part of the UAE economy
and their regular financial operations are key to supporting balanced growth, it remains essential
that rapid credit expansion and undue loan concentration to this sector be avoided to lessen the risk
of a renewed boom-bust cycle and to safeguard financial stability.
24.
Implementing the planned mortgage lending regulation and loan concentration limits
on GREs and emirate governments will help bolster financial stability. Following the
consultation with banks, these regulations should be implemented as soon as possible. Gradual

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES

transition paths should be agreed with any banks that might initially exceed the planned
concentration limits. In addition, imposing higher capital charges and introducing forward
provisioning on exposures to risky GREs could be considered to further mitigate risks to the banking
system. Regulation related to mortgage lending, including caps on loan-to-value and debt-serviceto-income ratios, will help mitigate real estate related risks, though the immediate effect on the
residential real estate market, currently largely a cash market, will be limited. Looking ahead, the
CBU should carefully monitor the interaction of mortgage lending and the real estate sector, and
tighten the mortgage regulation or introduce new measures as needed. It will also be important to
implement the forthcoming liquidity regulation in preparation for Basel III.

+ capital market funding maturing within 3 months
All scenarios assume that only 75% of non-resident interbank assets is available when calculating the liquidity gap.

25.
Strengthening the macroprudential framework, including through an enhanced
mandate for financial stability for the CBU, could help mitigate systemic risks.9
Macroprudential policy can play an important role in the UAE, particularly against a backdrop of
reliance on volatile hydrocarbon revenues, limited monetary policy independence in light of the peg
to the US dollar, the risk of procyclical fiscal policy, and an open capital account. The CBU’s
publication of its inaugural Financial Stability Review in 2012 was an important step highlighting the
importance of macroprudential policy. In addition, development of a more formal and transparent
macroprudential institutional and policy framework would be desirable: it should entail assigning
the mandate for financial stability, and defining a coordination framework, objectives, analytical

9

See Selected Issues Paper on “Macroprudential Policy in the United Arab Emirates”.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES

methods, and the policy toolkit. The adoption of the draft Financial Services Law would provide an
opportunity to establish the legal base for an improved macroprudential policy framework.
26.
The planned financial sector assessment will be a welcome opportunity to review the
sector’s strengths and weaknesses. The mission believes that an assessment under the Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), now planned for late 2014, could play an important role in
further strengthening the CBU as banking system regulator and supervisor, while facilitating further
financial sector development.
27.
Gross foreign inflows to the banking sector remain steady and would deserve closer
monitoring. Non-resident deposits have increased by more than 15 percent in 2012 and account
for 12 percent of total deposits. In the context of mounting international efforts against money
laundering and tax crimes, the authorities are encouraged to continue improving their
understanding of the origin of financial inflows and of the beneficial owners of deposits and loans in
the UAE. This would assist in effectively mitigating potential financial sector risks. In light of the 2008
anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) mutual evaluation
report and follow-up reports, as well as of the revised Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standard,
the authorities are encouraged to continue their efforts in bolstering the soundness of the financial
sector which could benefit from measures designed to improve compliance with the standard,
including those related to customer due diligence, cross-border cash couriers, and hawaladars. In
addition, staff invites the authorities to undergo an AML/CFT assessment in the context of the
planned FSAP.
28.
The CBU agreed that the banking system should be shielded from excessive exposure
to the real estate and GRE sectors. The CBU highlighted its efforts to ensure that the banking
system continues to have adequate buffers in the coming years, when a significant amount of
restructured debt is coming due. To this end, it imposed increasing general provisioning
requirements over time, and also stated its intention to continue with its policy of restricting
dividend distributions as needed. It stressed that the planned mortgage lending and loan
concentration caps, which were calibrated following consultation with the banking sector, will limit
excessive exposure while allowing for continued lending to these important sectors. The CBU
underscored recent measures it has taken to strengthen its macroprudential framework and analysis,
including increased resources for the Financial Stability Unit and expanding the analytical toolkit.
The authorities also noted that the current draft of the Financial Services Law explicitly provides a
legal base for an improved financial stability framework. They also stressed their strong efforts in the
area of AML/CFT, including domestic regulation and international cooperation.

D. Structural and Statistical Issues
29.
Effective intergovernmental coordination of fiscal policy will reinforce effective
demand management and fiscal sustainability. Given the federal structure, fiscal coordination
between the federal and emirate governments is important for strengthening near- and mediumterm fiscal planning. Notable progress has been made in sharing information on fiscal outcomes
among governments, facilitated by the Fiscal Policy Coordination Council. Staff encouraged the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES

authorities to further strengthen fiscal coordination by continuing to improve the quality and scope
of shared information, leveraging the information for macrofiscal analysis to inform policy-making,
enhancing expenditure policy coordination, and jointly discussing budgets and medium-term fiscal
plans. The authorities agreed on the importance of sustained efforts in this area, in collaboration
with the IMF through technical assistance.
30.
Developing the local currency debt market should be given greater urgency. Domestic
debt market development would help reduce UAE firms’ reliance on foreign funding and provide an
alternative to borrowing from the domestic banking sector, especially for long-term funds. As a first
step, the government securities market should be developed, providing a benchmark yield curve
and facilitating liquidity management with a view to the forthcoming Basel III liquidity norms for
banks. The federal and Abu Dhabi governments are both considering the issuance of domestic debt
to meet these objectives.
31.
The UAE has been working for several years on a set of laws in a push to modernize its
legislative system.10 Swiftly passing these laws, in particular the Insolvency Law, the Financial
Services Law, and the Public Debt Law, would be crucial to improving the effectiveness of the debt
restructuring process and financial sector regulation and supervision, as well as to developing the
domestic debt market.
32.
Steering nationals towards private-sector jobs has become a priority. Only a fraction of
nationals currently work in the private sector, and emiratization efforts have primarily been based on
training and placement programs and partnership initiatives with the private sector. The authorities
are considering additional measures to attract Emiratis to the private sector, recognizing that
effective labor market reform is a long-term policy agenda, with a wide range of measures including
reforms to the sponsorship system, internal labor market mobility, improved social protection
schemes, and, possibly, subsidies for employing nationals in the private sector.
33.
Further improving the UAE’s statistical capacity remains key. The authorities have made
laudable progress in preparing consolidated government finance statistics, as evidenced by the
UAE’s submission of its fiscal accounts to the GFS Yearbook for the first time in 2012. Moreover, the
planned introduction of an international transactions reporting system at the CBU will be an
important step toward strengthening the quality of balance of payments statistics. It will be
important to maintain the momentum of strengthening economic statistics by providing adequate
resources for improving the quality of the national accounts and for producing demographic and
labor markets statistics, while continuing to strengthen balance of payments statistics. The
authorities indicated interest in beginning to develop statistics on the International Investment
Position, which will be essential to close an important statistical gap.

These laws include the Commercial Companies Law, Auditors Law, Arbitration Law, Foreign Investment Law,
Industry Law, Insolvency Law, Small and Medium Enterprises Law, Financial Services Law, and Public Debt Law.

STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
Short- and medium-term growth prospects are positive, and external downside risks,
while still substantial, have declined. The non-oil economy is projected to expand by over
4 percent per annum in the coming years on the back of Dubai’s strong core services sectors and
Abu Dhabi’s diversification efforts. The still-uncertain global economic and financial environment
could pose external risks to this favorable outlook, although the UAE’s sizeable foreign assets and
improving fiscal position provide significant buffers.
35.
In this environment, it will be key to enact policies to strengthen the economy’s
resilience and mitigate the risk of entering a renewed boom-bust cycle. The pace of recovery in
some segments of the real estate market and a number of announcements since late 2012 of new
megaprojects in real estate and tourism warrant a cautious approach to policymaking. This approach
should entail implementing further fiscal consolidation, limiting new risk-taking by the large and still
highly indebted GRE sector, and devising prudent financial sector regulation. At the same time, there
is a need for continued focus on dealing with the legacy of the 2009 crisis.
36.
Fiscal policy is appropriately aimed at consolidation. The strengthening economy allows
for further withdrawal of the large fiscal stimulus implemented in the context of the 2009 crisis,
bringing spending again closer to levels consistent with intergenerational equity, and further
reducing break-even oil prices. Fiscal consolidation will also help contain fiscal vulnerabilities
stemming from Dubai in the face of potentially large contingent liabilities. Should the rise in real
estate prices in some sectors continue unabated, the authorities should consider implementing
targeted increases in real estate-related fees, which could help mitigate speculative price pressures
while generating revenue in support of fiscal consolidation. Building on recent progress in
developing MTFFs, such frameworks should continue to be refined, and, in the case of Abu Dhabi,
increasingly integrated into the budget formulation process.
37.
Building on progress in restructuring the debt of GREs, Dubai should continue to focus
on strengthening the GRE sector. The total debt of the Dubai government and GREs continues to
be large, and GREs are likely to continue facing financial challenges in light of large outstanding
debt and significant maturities, including on restructured debt, falling due between 2014 and 2018.
Many of Dubai’s GREs continue to be nontransparent, making an assessment of the sector’s financial
health and associated macroeconomic risks difficult. Improving the transparency and governance of
GREs, as well as timely communication about key maturing debt will be important to support market
confidence.
38.
Close oversight of the GREs will be essential to prevent a renewed cycle of risk-taking.
Dubai’s GREs and banks are increasingly regaining access to external financing in an environment of
high global liquidity and search for yield. Renewed large-scale external and domestic borrowing to
finance ambitious real estate and tourism projects should be preempted to avoid setting off a new
boom-bust cycle. Continued close oversight of GREs by the Dubai Supreme Fiscal Committee will be

essential, and should be strengthened by developing adequate mechanisms for prioritizing and
sequencing major projects, and for assessing the quality of planned spending.
39.
The implementation of planned prudential regulations will help mitigate the risk of a
build-up of banking sector vulnerabilities. With significant capital and liquidity buffers, banks
show substantial resilience to shocks. Building on this strength, it will be important to preempt the
build-up of new vulnerabilities. Swift implementation of the planned new prudential regulations for
mortgage lending and loan concentration would mitigate the risk of rapid credit expansion and
undue loan concentration to the real estate and GRE sectors in the future. These policies should be
complemented by developing a more formal and transparent macroprudential institutional and
policy framework. The proposed new Financial Services Law provides an opportunity to establish the
legal base for such a framework. Developing the domestic fixed income market would support
banks’ liquidity management as they prepare for the introduction of the Basel III liquidity norms, and
would help the diversification of funding sources for corporates. The planned assessment under the
FSAP will be a welcome opportunity to review the financial sector’s strengths and weaknesses. This
assessment would also be a suitable occasion to conduct a review of the UAE’s AML/CFT policies.
40.
Staff welcomes the notable progress made in fiscal coordination among the federal
and emirate governments. Building on this achievement, coordination can be further strengthened
by improving the quality and availability of fiscal information and macrofiscal analysis, jointly
discussing budgets and MTFFs, and enhancing expenditure policy coordination.
41.
Staff encourages the authorities to build on recent progress in improving statistics. It
will be important to maintain the recent momentum of strengthening economic statistics by
providing adequate resources for improving the quality of the national accounts and for producing
demographic and labor markets statistics, while continuing to strengthen balance of payments
statistics. Developing statistics on the International Investment Position will be essential to close an
important gap.
42.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12month cycle.

1.
The real exchange rate has
continued depreciating. Following its
peak in 2008, the trade-weighted real
effective exchange rate (REER) has been
depreciating, with the index falling by
4 percent year-on-year
in December 2012. The nominal
effective exchange rate (NEER) has
appreciated slightly over the same
period, in line with the U.S. dollar
(Figure 1).

2.
The equilibrium exchange rate approach indicates a moderate undervaluation. For
many commodity exporters, commodity price fluctuations can explain exchange rate changes
(Cashin, Cespedes and Sahay, 2004).

3.
The macroeconomic
balance approach indicates that the
currency is broadly in line with
fundamentals. In contrast to the
equilibrium exchange rate approach,
which directly compares the REER to
its determinants, the macroeconomic
balance (MB) compares the projected
current account balance to a number
of macroeconomic determinants of
the current account, including the

non-oil fiscal balance, hydrocarbon wealth, and estimates of accumulated foreign assets. It yields a
current account norm of 7 percent of GDP in 2018, compared to a projected current account surplus
of 7.4 percent, indicating that the current account is appropriate given projected fiscal balances and
other fundamentals (Table 1).
4.
The external sustainability approach indicates a need for long-term external
adjustment. The underpinning of this approach is that the sustainability of the current account
trajectory requires that the net present value (NPV) of all future oil and financial or investment
income (wealth) be equal to the NPV of imports of goods and services net of non-oil exports. The
current account norm represents the level of the current account which would support
intergenerational equity, given exhaustible oil reserves, through appropriately paced accumulation
of foreign assets. This

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of May 2013)
Technical cooperation between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the Bank started in 1980 on a
case-by-case-basis. By 1994, the relationship developed to the extent that a Framework Agreement
for technical cooperation was signed to facilitate an ongoing program of advisory services.
At the federal level, the Bank provided assistance to the Ministry of Finance in the area of debt
market development: a bond market development strategy was completed in May 2008, and the
Bank later assisted with certain aspects of its implementation. In 2010, the Ministry of Labor
requested technical assistance in labor market development, including Emiratization policies and
Labor Market Information System development; the project was completed in 2011. Currently, the
Bank is helping develop a national health insurance scheme and is preparing a public expenditure
review in the health and higher education sectors.
The Bank has also delivered technical assistance to individual Emirates. In Ras Al Khaimah (RAK),
technical cooperation included assistance in promoting a better investment climate and in
mobilizing private investment. Following such assistance, an investors' conference (May 2005)
attracted major strategic, financial and individual investors from around the world. More recently,
the Bank provided advice to the Government of RAK on a multi-jurisdictional student loan program
design.
In Abu Dhabi, the Bank provided assistance to Abu Dhabi Food Control Authority on a food security
program for the Emirate of Abu Dhabi; at present, the Bank is providing assistance to Abu Dhabi
Judicial Department on a court reform process and is in dialogue with Abu Dhabi Council to support
private sector development efforts.
In Dubai, the Bank assisted in the analysis of retirement planning options for expatriate workers;
follow-up technical assistance is under discussion. Currently, the Bank is analyzing the impact of
utilizing the Bank's framework to enhance the quality of education in private schools.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of May 2013)
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, but there are substantial shortcomings on
the accounts of government-related corporations. In particular, there is limited data on GRE debt and
contingent liabilities to the government. The federal and individual emirates’ agencies have improved the
availability and quality of the statistics, but more progress is needed. The adoption of the Federal Statistics
Law on May 18, 2009, and the establishment of an independent National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) are
important steps in establishing a statistical system at the federal level. While the Law expressly requires all
agencies and local statistical centers to provide data as required by the NBS, its success will depend on
implementing arrangements, staffing, funding and training.
National Accounts: The methodology broadly conforms to the 1968 SNA. GDP is compiled annually with
a lag of around 5 months. Some progress has been made in improving the source data but further work is
needed to improve updating procedures, and quarterly indicators are not available.
Price statistics: Following technical assistance from the IMF Statistics Department, the Ministry of
Economy started publishing a monthly CPI since January 2008. However, price indexes and GDP deflators
need further harmonization at the federal level.
Government finance statistics: In 2008, six of the seven emirates and the federal government have
received technical support in the compilation of fiscal data on a consolidated basis, using the GFSM 2001
format and 2008 as a base year. In 2011, GFSM 2001 was introduced by the federal and several emirate
governments, and the institutional arrangement to ensure adequate data provision was established. This
consolidation should complement initiatives to establish debt management units at both the emirate and
federal levels. The UAE submitted its fiscal accounts to the GFS Yearbook for the first time in 2012.
Monetary statistics: The central bank has shifted the responsibility for compiling and disseminating
monetary data to the Banking Supervision Department, in order to improve the timeliness of data to
monthly frequency with less than a month lag. Although some monetary aggregates and FSIs are already
published on a monthly basis, the Banking Supervision Department has not been trained in MFSM 2000
and the published data do not follow the recommended methodology.
Balance of Payments: The information needed to compile the balance of payments is insufficient,
especially for the financial account. Many components of the IIP also are missing or incomplete, as the
data on government foreign assets and private holdings of foreign assets and liabilities are not published
or lack appropriate surveys. The development of a comprehensive Balance of Payments and IIP is however
within the reach of the UAE if the central bank, the NBS, and the Ministry of Economy strengthen their
capacity and receive appropriate support at the high level. The CBU plans to introduce an international
transactions reporting system to strengthen the quality of balance of payments statistics. The authorities
indicated interest in beginning to develop statistics on the International Investment Position, which will be
essential to close an important statistical gap.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Participant in the GDDS since July 31, 2008. The metadata were last updated in 2008 (Monetary and BOP),
2008 (National Accounts and Prices), and 2008 (Government Finance). No Data ROSC is available.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 30, 2013

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with
United Arab Emirates
On July 15, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with United Arab Emirates and considered and endorsed the staff
appraisal without a meeting.1
The economic recovery continued in 2012 supported by favorable oil prices, capital inflows
and the UAE’s safe-haven status amid the regional political and social unrest. Overall GDP
growth is projected to have reached 4.3 percent in 2012 as hydrocarbon production expanded
by around 5.2 percent, and non-oil growth accelerated to 3.8 percent. The external current
account surplus rose to almost 17 percent of GDP supported also by buoyant
non-hydrocarbon exports. A broadening recovery in construction and real estate, and ongoing
growth in tourism-oriented sectors are expected to underpin a further acceleration in non-oil
growth to 4.3 percent this year. At the same time, growth in oil production will likely slow in
the context of ample global supply. Non-hydrocarbon growth is expected to remain strong at
above 4 percent in the medium term, though subject to substantial external risks. Inflation
remained subdued at 0.7 percent in 2012, and is expected to pick up only moderately in 2013.
Aiming to build on its achievements in becoming a regional services and tourism hub, Dubai
recently announced plans for several new megaprojects in real estate and tourism that will be
executed to a large extent through its Government-Related Entities (GRE). Dubai’s GREs are
increasingly regaining access to external financing in an environment of ample global
liquidity, while their debt continues to be high. While GRE debt restructurings related to the
2009 crisis are nearing completion, several large maturities are now drawing closer,
including on restructured debt, between 2014 and 2018.
The banking system maintains significant capital and liquidity buffers, and non-performing
loans may finally have peaked at 8.7 percent in December 2012. Nonetheless, further
restructuring of GRE debt, including possibly on already restructured debt, could still add
materially to this level. Despite the accommodative monetary stance under the peg to the
U.S. dollar, lending to the private sector has remained sluggish.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2013 Article IV consultation with the United Arab Emirates, Executive
Directors endorsed staff’s appraisal, as follows:
Short- and medium-term growth prospects are positive, and external downside risks, while
still substantial, have declined. The non-oil economy is projected to expand by over 4 percent
per annum in the coming years on the back of Dubai’s strong core services sectors and Abu
Dhabi’s diversification efforts. The still-uncertain global economic and financial
environment could pose external risks to this favorable outlook, although the UAE’s sizeable
foreign assets and improving fiscal position provide significant buffers.
In this environment, it will be key to enact policies to strengthen the economy’s resilience
and mitigate the risk of entering a renewed boom-bust cycle. The pace of recovery in some
segments of the real estate market and a number of announcements since late 2012 of new
megaprojects in real estate and tourism warrant a cautious approach to policymaking. This
approach should entail implementing further fiscal consolidation, limiting new risk-taking by
the large and still highly indebted GRE sector, and devising prudent financial sector
regulation. At the same time, there is a need for continued focus on dealing with the legacy
of the 2009 crisis.
Fiscal policy is appropriately aimed at consolidation. The strengthening economy allows for
further withdrawal of the large fiscal stimulus implemented in the context of the 2009 crisis,
bringing spending again closer to levels consistent with intergenerational equity, and further
reducing break-even oil prices. Fiscal consolidation will also help contain fiscal
vulnerabilities stemming from Dubai in the face of potentially large contingent liabilities.
Should the rise in real estate prices in some sectors continue unabated, the authorities should
consider implementing targeted increases in real estate-related fees, which could help
mitigate speculative price pressures while generating revenue in support of fiscal
consolidation. Building on recent progress in developing Medium Term Fiscal Frameworks
(MTFFs), such frameworks should continue to be refined, and, in the case of Abu Dhabi,
increasingly integrated into the budget formulation process.
Building on progress in restructuring the debt of GREs, Dubai should continue to focus on
strengthening the GRE sector. The total debt of the Dubai government and GREs continues
to be large, and GREs are likely to continue facing financial challenges in light of large
outstanding debt and significant maturities, including on restructured debt, falling due
between 2014 and 2018. Many of Dubai’s GREs continue to be nontransparent, making an
assessment of the sector’s financial health and associated macroeconomic risks difficult.
Improving the transparency and governance of GREs, as well as timely communication about
key maturing debt will be important to support market confidence.
Close oversight of the GREs will be essential to prevent a renewed cycle of risk-taking.
Dubai’s GREs and banks are increasingly regaining access to external financing in an
environment of high global liquidity and search for yield. Renewed large-scale external and

3

domestic borrowing to finance ambitious real estate and tourism projects should be
preempted to avoid setting off a new boom-bust cycle. Continued close oversight of GREs by
the Dubai Supreme Fiscal Committee will be essential, and should be strengthened by
developing adequate mechanisms for prioritizing and sequencing major projects, and for
assessing the quality of planned spending.
The implementation of planned prudential regulations will help mitigate the risk of a buildup of banking sector vulnerabilities. With significant capital and liquidity buffers, banks
show substantial resilience to shocks. Building on this strength, it will be important to
preempt the build-up of new vulnerabilities. Swift implementation of the planned new
prudential regulations for mortgage lending and loan concentration would mitigate the risk of
rapid credit expansion and undue loan concentration to the real estate and GRE sectors in the
future. These policies should be complemented by developing a more formal and transparent
macroprudential institutional and policy framework. The proposed new Financial Services
Law provides an opportunity to establish the legal base for such a framework. Developing
the domestic fixed income market would support banks’ liquidity management as they
prepare for the introduction of the Basel III liquidity norms, and would help the
diversification of funding sources for corporates. The planned assessment under the Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) will be a welcome opportunity to review the financial
sector’s strengths and weaknesses. This assessment would also be a suitable occasion to
conduct a review of the UAE’s Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of
Terrorism policies.
Staff welcomes the notable progress made in fiscal coordination among the federal and
emirate governments. Building on this achievement, coordination can be further strengthened
by improving the quality and availability of fiscal information and macrofiscal analysis,
jointly discussing budgets and MTFFs, and enhancing expenditure policy coordination.
Staff encourages the authorities to build on recent progress in improving statistics. It will be
important to maintain the recent momentum of strengthening economic statistics by
providing adequate resources for improving the quality of the national accounts and for
producing demographic and labor markets statistics, while continuing to strengthen balance
of payments statistics. Developing statistics on the International Investment Position will be
essential to close an important gap.
