I. STAFF APPRAISAL AND SUMMARY
1.
Montenegro is highly exposed to the rapidly dimming global outlook. Global
financial turmoil and recession will likely have a substantial adverse impact on confidence,
credit growth, tourism, and FDI inflows in the near term. Thus, a sharp deceleration in
growth is expected in the near term. Moreover, over the medium term only a modest rebound
in growth is expected, as FDI and credit growth are unlikely to return to the extremely high
levels observed in recent years. Cooling demand will also have a substantial adverse impact
on fiscal revenues, and the fiscal position is coming under pressure.
2.
Financial sector vulnerabilities are substantial. Banks’ Non Performing Loan
(NPL) ratios have been rising despite booming credit growth, and there is a substantial
exposure to the rapidly cooling construction sector. Banking system exposure to a sudden
stop or even reversal in foreign financing inflows from parent banks is also high. Public
confidence remains fragile, and a blanket deposit guarantee introduced in October 2008—as
nervousness about the impact of global financial turmoil on the largely foreign-owned
banking system intensified—slowed but did not stop deposit withdrawals. However, all
parent banks have supported their subsidiaries with additional funding thus far, thus partly
offsetting the drain on deposits.
3.
Moreover, fiscal plans are likely to undermine fiscal stability, and should be
reconsidered. As a result of a pro-cyclical fiscal policy in recent boom years, a substantial
structural deficit has already emerged in 2008. Plans for cuts in tax and contribution rates and
increases in capital and social expenditure will substantially increase the structural deficit in
2009 and beyond, leading to rapidly rising public debt. Moreover, there are substantial
contingent liabilities linked to the blanket guarantee of bank deposits, potential
recapitalization of banks, the lossmaking aluminum company, and longer term aging
pressures. And the fiscal stimulus is unlikely to be very effective, given the large share of
imports, narrow production base, and tight credit conditions.
4.
And rapid wage growth, in the context of the euro peg, is reducing the
competitiveness of the economy. A continued erosion in competitiveness will ultimately
undermine Montenegro’s attractiveness as a destination for FDI, making it more difficult to
broaden the production base of the economy.
5.
Policy should focus on maintaining financial sector and fiscal stability, while
continuing to improve the regulatory and institutional framework. In addition to
macroeconomic stability, sustained growth will require improvements to public infrastructure
and administration, the business environment, and the flexibility of the labor market.
6.
Fiscal policy should be guided by a net debt anchor, and supported by a medium
term expenditure framework to help entrench countercyclical policy. The objective
should be to reduce net debt to 20 percent of GDP by 2013, which would require a
cancellation of the tax and contribution cuts and capital expenditure increase, plus modest

5
restraint on current expenditure. A well designed medium term expenditure framework
would create scope for the free operation of automatic stabilizers while supporting
consolidation efforts. In order to be credible, the expenditure envelope should be
underpinned by the development of a coherent planning framework backed by tangible
measures and expenditure reforms.
7.
Continued vigilance and strong implementation of prudential measures will be
needed to enhance bank soundness. Welcome steps already taken include tighter reserve
requirements, temporary credit ceilings, a centralized credit registry, and higher solvency
ratios for banks with high credit growth. Moreover, tighter capital, liquidity, and provisioning
rules are being phased in through March 2009, which should help strengthen banks’
resilience to shocks. Reducing the lag in repaying deposits from failed banks would also
increase confidence in the deposit insurance system.
8.
Future economic growth will depend critically on further improvement of the
regulatory framework and institutions. Increased labor market flexibility and a substantial
reduction in red tape at the municipality level are needed to support private sector
development. And firm implementation of electricity sector reforms is needed to improve the
efficiency and reliability of electricity production. Moreover, some additional resources in
statistics will also go a long way in improving economic policymaking.
9.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.
II. CONTEXT
10.
Montenegro has made significant progress in overhauling its economy. The last
five years have seen inflation performance improved through the adoption of the euro as sole
legal tender; banking sector restructuring; significant privatization; strengthened market
infrastructure; and progress in fiscal consolidation. The authorities’ objective is to create a
business friendly, open economy with low taxes and minimal state interference, and to
integrate the country in Atlantic-European structures. After joining NATO’s PfP program in
2006, accession to the EU is at the top of the political agenda: the Stabilization and
Association Agreement (SAA) was signed in 2007, and an application for EU membership
was submitted in December 2008.
11.
Reform efforts have been rewarded, particularly following independence, by
strong foreign investor interest. There have been large FDI inflows primarily into the
tourism sector and associated real estate, and banking. Real estate sales to foreign investors
have generated strong wealth effects, contributed to a sharp increase in bank deposits, and
boosted domestic demand. Alongside, construction has boomed. Credit growth has soared,
stimulated by surging deposits and keen competition in the largely foreign owned banking
sector.

6
12.
As a result, the economy
has boomed (Tables 1–2). GDP
growth accelerated from
4.2 percent in 2005 to 10.7 percent
in 2007, led by construction and
consumption. Employment and
wages have grown strongly, while
registered unemployment has
halved from 20 percent in 2005 to
10.7 percent in 2008.

13.
However, financial sector stability and the fiscal position are coming under
pressure as the global outlook dims, and a large external deficit has emerged. Banks’
credit risk management does not appear to have kept pace with booming credit, and asset
quality is declining rapidly. Moreover, banks are vulnerable to shocks to foreign financing
from their parents as global financial turmoil continues. Also, a substantial structural fiscal
deficit raises the prospect of a rapid deterioration in the fiscal position as the demand boom
unwinds. And the current account deficit increased to over 30 percent of GDP in 2008 as
booming FDI and credit stimulated strong demand for imports.
14.
Much of recent Fund advice has been implemented. The central bank has
implemented most of the recent FSAP recommendations, and also reined in credit growth.
Privatization efforts continue, and in the electricity sector tariffs have been raised while cross
subsidization has been reduced. A new labor law goes some way towards meeting FundBank recommendations. However, it has proven difficult to implement countercyclical fiscal
policy during the boom.
15.
But despite reform progress, red tape and political strains persist. Excessive
regulation, particularly at municipality level, remains significant, constraining the business
environment. The grey economy is reportedly very large. And while the services and
construction sectors appear buoyant, the manufacturing base is narrow and has been
declining in 2008. There have also been strong differences in opinion on the reform agenda
within the ruling coalition, with the minority coalition partner exhibiting lower enthusiasm
for reforms, and raising concerns about corruption in the privatization process. Early
elections are expected by end-March.
16.
Given the concerns about fiscal and financial sector soundness and the
worsening outlook, the mission focused on policies to help achieve a soft landing. Thus,
discussions focused on measures to strengthen banking system stability; crisis response
preparedness; fiscal consolidation and measures to help entrench countercyclical policy; and
competitiveness.

Wages grew 25 percent in August
2008 (y/y) well in excess of
productivity growth and partly
reflecting a 30 percent hike in
public sector wages in early 2008.
Inflation also rose sharply in the
first half of 2008, reflecting
domestic demand pressures,
administrative price increases, and
the general global increase in food
and energy prices in early 2008, but
has since eased.

•

Private sector credit growth dropped to 23 percent in 2008, well below the record high
176 percent for 2007, reflecting prudential tightening measures in early 2008, lower risk
appetite by foreign and domestic banks, and a significant decline in deposits as global
financial turmoil tested public confidence (Figure 1).

•

And FDI inflows are weakening as investment opportunities narrow. For Q1–Q3 2008,
FDI inflows were €668 million, 10½ percent below the inflows for the same period of
2007. Construction activity has also weakened considerably in the latter part of 2008.
And while comprehensive data on real estate prices are not available, anecdotal evidence
suggests that prices in tourist areas have fallen sharply in the past few months.

•

As in other countries in the region, equity prices have dropped sharply in thin trading as
worries about the impact of global financial turmoil mount.

•

However, the trade deficit continued to widen, as import growth remained strong while
exports were dampened, in part, by the impact of low aluminum prices on the aluminum
company responsible for about 15 percent of exports.

Thus, GDP growth is projected to have declined to 7½ percent in 2008, while annual average
inflation is projected to have risen to around 8¾ percent. Also, the current account deficit is
expected to have increased to over 31 percent of GDP.

Staff project a sharp deceleration in growth in the near term. GDP growth is
likely to decline to about 2 percent in 2009–2010 as the demand boom fades. Credit growth
is likely to slow to low single digits at best in 2009, given banks’ reduced appetite for risk,
further prudential tightening, and the difficulty of accessing foreign financing in the current
global environment. And global recession is also likely to adversely affect tourism and FDI.
In addition, the aluminum company has already announced a halving of its output in 2009,
and it could shut down completely without public assistance.

1/ Fiscal projection reflects the authorities' plan.

19.
And only a modest rebound is likely as global recession ends. While FDI is likely
to remain strong over the medium term, the recent exceptionally high levels—which saw FDI
rise to as much as 21¾ percent of GDP in 2006—are unlikely to be repeated. Similarly,
credit growth is also unlikely to return to the unsustainably high levels observed in recent
years. Thus GDP growth is expected to increase to around 4½ percent over the medium term.
With demand pressures abating the current account deficit is projected to decline to
10 percent of GDP, while inflation is projected to fall to around 3¼ percent, over the medium
term.
20.
The authorities were more optimistic about the outlook, however. They pointed to
the country’s tourism potential and possible large FDI projects as drivers of growth.
However, over the course of the mission a steady flow of negative news on the global
economy and outlook caused some movement—particularly in the central bank—towards
staff’s position.
21.
Domestic and external risks to the outlook are substantial and tilted to the
downside. Financial sector, fiscal, and external vulnerabilities are substantial, and rapidly
declining growth in Europe could have a more adverse impact on growth than currently
envisaged.

10
•

Despite high credit growth, the NPL ratio has been rising, signaling a very rapid buildup
of bad loans (Tables 3–4). Problem assets (classified B-E) doubled in one year to
236 percent of banking system capital and reserves as of September 2008. Private sector
credit is now well above the typical level for countries at Montenegro’s stage of
development, and banks are heavily exposed to the rapidly cooling construction sector.

•

While the credit boom was initially funded by deposits, foreign financing from parent
banks has increased rapidly recently. As a result, the vulnerability of the banking system
to a sudden stop or even reversal in financing from parent banks is substantial (Figure 2).

Preliminary figures.

•

Reflecting these financial sector risks, the authorities have recently had to extend support
to Prva Banka, the second largest bank, and its loan portfolio is likely to contract
significantly in 2009. Also, in October the Hungarian bank OTP—parent of the largest
bank—came under pressure amid a sharp selloff in its equities, increasing public
nervousness about the banking system and contributing to significant deposit outflows.

•

While a substantial portion of the current account deficit is covered by FDI inflows, this
coverage is declining, and private external borrowing, particularly by banks, is rising
rapidly (Table 5). Although euroization shields Montenegro from currency crises, the
scale and pace of the deterioration in the current account could indicate eroding
competitiveness. From a savings-investment perspective, the main counterpart of the
current account deficit is high private sector dissaving (-10 percent of GDP in 2008).

And headline fiscal surpluses primarily reflect surging VAT revenues as demand boomed
(Table 6). Fiscal policy has been procyclical, and the structural deficit increased to an
estimated 3¼ percent of GDP in 2008. This raises the risk that a fiscal tightening may be
needed during a downturn, amplifying the cycle.

On the other hand, there is a possibility that large FDI projects could be implemented, which
would have a significant upward impact on economic activity. Also, the economic stimulus
packages worldwide could have a strong effect on foreign demand.
22.
While competitiveness appears
broadly adequate currently, it is likely to
decline further over the near term
(Figure 3, Box 1, Table 7). Given the
strong impact of credit growth on private
sector saving, the expected sharp
deceleration in credit growth should have a
substantial corrective impact on the current
account deficit. However, strong wage
pressures points to a further deterioration of
competitiveness, which will likely limit
Montenegro’s attractiveness as a destination
for FDI.

Box 1. Montenegro: Assessing Competitiveness
The CGER methodology yields divergent assessments, but, on balance, finds no substantive evidence of weak
competitiveness. Montenegro’s high current account deficit primarily reflects transitory demand pressures
(stimulated by extremely high credit growth and FDI inflows, and sharp increases in real estate and stock
market prices) and should decline as these pressures unwind. Under the macro balance approach, the
underlying balance, which adjusts for transitory factors, is currently close to its equilibrium level (which
includes FDI among its fundamental determinants), implying a moderate real exchange rate overvaluation of
6 percent. On the other hand, the external sustainability approach implies a 10 percent undervaluation, while
the ERER approach—with the largest uncertainty margin due to data problems—suggests undervaluation of
16 percent.

However, competitiveness appears to be declining. CPI-based competitiveness measures show little movement
but ULC-based measures suggest erosion of competitiveness (not atypical in the first phase of convergence).
There has been a large decline in the ratio of producer prices to unit labor costs, suggesting deteriorating

IV. FINANCIAL SECTOR RISKS REQUIRE CAREFUL MANAGEMENT
23.
Financial sector vulnerabilities are substantial, but the central bank has been
pro-active in introducing prudential measures. In addition to rising NPL ratios, key
financial stability indicators have been deteriorating, including bank profitability and
provisioning. The average banking system solvency ratio is 16 percent, but staff estimate that
a 10 percent loan loss will reduce it to 10½ percent, barely above the prudential minimum of
10 percent. Thus, strong prudential measures are needed to strengthen bank soundness.
Cognizant of these vulnerabilities, the central bank has taken several welcome steps to
strengthen financial sector soundness (Box 2). It has also been pro-active in seeking
understandings with parent banks and home supervisors regarding the handling of potential
liquidity and solvency problems. Market participants were very supportive of the temporary
ceilings on credit growth, which they considered instrumental for taming the race for market
share at the expense of loan quality.
24.
And in October 2008, as global financial turmoil intensified, the authorities took
strong steps to reduce banking system risks. As public nervousness about the impact of
global financial turmoil on the domestic banking system increased in late September,
widespread and significant deposit withdrawals occurred throughout the banking system,
prompting the announcement of a package of measures (see Box 2). These measures,
particularly the blanket deposit guarantee, helped slow deposit withdrawals. In addition, all
parent banks have supported their subsidiaries with additional funding, thus helping to
partially offset the decline in deposits, and banking system net foreign liabilities increased
significantly in Q4 2008 (see Table 3). However, confidence in the banking system remains
fragile, as deposit withdrawals have slowed but not stopped, particularly in the larger
banks—in December private deposits declined by a further 5 percent, bringing the
cumulative decline over Q4 2008 to 18 percent.
Staff welcomed these measures and urged firm implementation of the planned
prudential tightening. Stronger provisioning and larger capital and liquidity buffers would
improve the resilience of banks in weathering any shocks that could occur, and would also
help increase public confidence in the banking system. The mission also suggested that
excessively high debt to income ratios for borrowers should be discouraged. Staff also
recommended that the lag between a bank failure and repayment of deposits be significantly
reduced from the current 60 days, in order to increase public confidence in the deposit
guarantee system.
25.

26.
The enforcement powers of the central bank could be further strengthened, as
recommended in the recent FSAP. The current banking law does not give supervisors
sufficient latitude to impose remedial measures on banks under administration without prior
approval by shareholders, or to impose penalties without first obtaining court approval. And
legal protections for supervisors could be improved. The authorities considered that the
current level of legal protections had been adequate thus far but remained to be tested in

15
Box 2. Recent Measures to Strengthen Bank Soundness
The rapid credit expansion during the boom has overstretched banks’ credit risk management capacity,
leading to excesses and the weakening of prudential ratios (Table 4). With a view to safeguarding bank
soundness, the CBCG has taken several important measures to improve credit and liquidity risk management
at banks and beef up their capitalization:
To reduce credit expansion to more sustainable levels and improve credit risk management:
• Temporary bank-by-bank credit ceilings were introduced in January 2008. Ranging from 30% to
60%, the ceilings were inversely related to each bank’s receivables.
• The base for required reserves was broadened in January 2008 to include public sector deposits
irrespective of maturity, and the required reserves rate on time deposits with maturity of up to
180 days was increased.
• The credit registry became fully operational and banks were required to use it in assessing and
classifying loans.
To beef up capital, reserves, and liquidity buffers and improve the operating environment:
• Tighter rules for asset classification and provisioning were introduced in September 2007. The
threshold for “loss loans” was shortened from 270 to 180 days, and reserves for general banking
risks linked (positively) to credit growth; and banks were required to review monthly the
classification of assets and off-balance sheet items.
• The minimum solvency ratio was raised from 8% to 10% and the new Banking Law allows CBCG
to ask for en even higher ratio if warranted by the risk profile of the bank. Banks should comply
with the new provisions by March 2009.
• Stricter capital, liquidity and provisioning rules are to be phased in by March 2009.
• The AML/CTF framework is also being upgraded. A new Law has been passed and implementing
legislation is being prepared; meanwhile, the FATF-style regional body, MONEYVAL conducted a
mutual evaluation, the report of which is expected during 2009.
In addition, the following measures were taken in response to the international financial crisis.
The government:
• Guaranteed all bank private deposits, and on a case-by-case basis, interbank lending until end-2009
(a public contingent liability of about 48 percent of GDP).
• Stood ready to use the substantial government deposits to repay early bank loans to government, and
to provide banks with loans for up to one year against collateral of shares of at least equal nominal
value, to help boost liquidity. In this context, a collateralized loan of €44 million was provided to
Prva Banka in December.
• Pledged up to €100 million for bank recapitalization on a case by case basis at the request of banks
or, in the case of systemically important banks, the central bank.
The central bank
• Created a short-term liquidity support facility enabling solvent banks to borrow against prime
collateral for up to 30 days, renewable up to three times. It also allowed banks to borrow up to
50 percent of their required reserves for periods not exceeding seven days in each month.

16
courts, and noted that increasing legal protections further would require changes to the
constitution.
27.
The authorities’ crisis response preparedness appears to be good. The authorities
have demonstrated strong vigilance and appreciation of the financial sector risks, and have
implemented MCM recommendations on contingency planning for emergency liquidity
support situations. These recommendations included dialogue with parent banks regarding
liquidity support, detailed bank by bank contingency plans, increase in banknote inventory of
the central bank, and arranging contingent credit lines. A follow-up MCM mission on crisis
preparedness and management is planned for January 2009.

V. FISCAL STABILITY IS COMING UNDER PRESSURE
28.
Booming domestic demand helped generate a substantial improvement in the
headline fiscal balance in 2007. The fiscal balance improved by 4¼ percentage points to a
surplus of 6½ percent of GDP, led by strong VAT revenue from booming consumption and
imports. Corporate tax and social security contributions also performed strongly.
29.
But the fiscal surplus likely declined significantly in 2008. While strong demand
kept taxes buoyant, overall revenues declined (in percent of GDP) as a result of cuts to social
contribution rates and a decline in non tax revenues. Moreover, expenditures increased
significantly, as a result of the 30 percent hike in public sector wages and increased transfers,
capital expenditure and net lending. Thus the headline fiscal surplus is expected to have
declined to 1½ percent of GDP. Booming demand masked a worsening of underlying fiscal
balances, and staff estimate that the structural fiscal balance declined to a deficit of around
3¼ percent of GDP in 2008 (Figure 4).

And large deficits are projected for 2009 and beyond, undermining fiscal
stability. Announced plans to cut tax and contribution rates by 2010 will substantially
weaken revenues.1 Moreover, sharp increases in capital expenditure and social transfers are
envisaged in the proposed 2009 budget. In addition to the tax and contribution cuts, the
strong deceleration in demand expected as credit and FDI slowdown will weaken revenues
significantly, with much of the revenue loss being permanent. Thus, staff project a deficit of
6¼ percent of GDP in 2009, with the position worsening further over the medium term as
additional tax cuts and cooling demand reduce revenues. This would cause net public debt to
increase by over 22 percentage points to 45¾ percent of GDP by 2013, raising sustainability
concerns.

31.
Moreover, the planned fiscal stimulus is not likely to have a significant impact on
activity. The fiscal multiplier is likely to be low, given a narrow production base, a large
share of imports in GDP, the sharp ongoing deceleration of credit, and the fact that a rapid
rise in public debt could cause some households to increase saving.
32.
Staff pressed for adherence to a medium term net debt target of 20 percent of
GDP. During the 2007 Article IV consultations there was agreement that a medium term
gross debt target of 30 percent of GDP would be appropriate. However, given large
government deposits, staff argued that a net debt anchor—with a corresponding target of
20 percent of GDP—would be a better guide for preserving the net worth of government, and
would help reduce pressures to draw down deposits. Achieving this target would require a
cancellation of the tax and contribution cuts and capital expenditure increase, plus restraint
on current expenditure, sufficient to reduce the structural deficit by a modest 0.2 percent of
1

Personal income tax, pension contribution, and health contribution rates are to be cut from the current
15 percent, 21 percent, and 12 percent, respectively, to 9 percent, 20 percent, and 9 percent, respectively,
by 2010.

19
GDP in 2009 and a further 0.1 percent of GDP in 2010. Alongside, automatic stabilizers
would widen the headline deficit by about 2 percent of GDP in 2009 and 1½ percent of GDP
in 2010. Given large contingent liabilities linked to the blanket guarantee of bank deposits,
potential recapitalization of banks, the lossmaking aluminum company, and longer term
aging pressures this consolidation should be considered the minimum needed.

33.
Public administration reform has significant potential to reduce expenditure.
Public administration employment is well above European norms, and there is scope for
efficiency gains from reforms (see Figure 4).
34.
However, the authorities insisted that with the economy cooling rapidly they
could not remain passive. They noted that limited possibilities for financing large deficits
would act as a natural check, and that as financing options tightened they would reduce
capital expenditure alongside. They also observed that plans for large public infrastructure
projects to be financed using Public-Private Partnership agreements would have to be
curtailed given the dimming outlook.
35.
There was broad agreement on the need for a medium term expenditure
framework to help entrench countercyclical policy. Given the absence of monetary policy,
countercyclical fiscal policy is the main instrument available to help alleviate the buildup of
macro imbalances. Implementing this would require a sound medium term expenditure
framework to provide a more structural approach to fiscal planning, allowing automatic
stabilizers to work freely while strengthening consolidation efforts. Staff noted that the
credibility of the framework would need to be backed by tangible measures and expenditure
reform.

20
VI. FURTHER STRUCTURAL REFORMS ARE CRITICAL FOR SUSTAINED GROWTH
36.
Given euroization, a flexible labor market is critical for maintaining
competitiveness and stimulating sustained growth. Significant employment protections
and a centralized collective bargaining system with little firm level flexibility have helped
keep wage growth and the unemployment rate high, and limited the buoyancy of the
corporate sector. Reflecting these rigidities, despite high unemployment seasonal surges in
labor demand by the tourism industry are typically met by large inflows of foreign workers
rather than from domestic sources. A new labor law, passed in mid-2008, reduces some of
the rigidities but still contains substantial employment protections, discouraging job creation
and longer-term employment contracts. The authorities however noted that the new law
represented a social compromise, and it would be difficult to revise it so soon after its
adoption.
37.
Electricity sector reform is also needed to alleviate shortages that constrain
growth. After a promising start, the unbundling of the lossmaking state owned electricity
company (EPCG) appeared to stall in late 2008, following the authorities’ announcement that
they were seeking a strategic investor to take up a minority stake in EPCG (with the
government retaining a 55 percent share). The announcement created uncertainty about
whether the authorities remained committed to unbundling, or were contemplating keeping
EPCG as a single entity. The situation was further complicated by the failure of EPCG to pay
its licensing fee to the electricity regulator, which undermined the regulator’s financial
viability and ultimately resulted in a lawsuit against EPCG. The authorities however assured
staff that the unbundling process would be re-energized in early 2009, and that at least part of
the licensing fee arrears would be paid to keep the regulator going.
38.
Staff also stressed the need to reduce the significant bureaucratic impediments
to starting and operating businesses at the municipality level. The authorities
acknowledged that red tape at the municipal level remained significant, but noted that a
planned elimination of some municipal real estate related taxes would help improve the
situation.
39.
Macroeconomic data need further improvement. While there have been some
improvements in economic statistics, there remain significant weaknesses, which hamper
policymaking. 2 National accounts and balance of payments data (particularly trade data and
credit flows from abroad) are weak, and there are no data on the expenditure side of real
GDP.

2

For example, official GDP data for 2007, released in December, indicate that nominal GDP grew 30.7 percent.
While real GDP growth of 10.7 percent was in line with other indicators, the deflator grew by an implausible
18 percent.

Appendix I: Montenegro—Debt Sustainability Analysis
I. Fiscal Sustainability
1.
The monitoring of general government debt continues to improve with regular and
transparent reporting of public debt by debt management unit in the Ministry of Finance.
IMF has provided technical assistance over the last two years through a peripatetic advisor.
In addition, the authorities now also include reporting of government deposits, making
monitoring of net debt possible.
2.
This debt sustainability analysis includes gross public debt that is recognized by the
authorities and covers the general government.1 Estimates of the liabilities from the
restitution process are also included. Parliament has limited the overall liabilities stemming
from restitution to a maximum of 10 percent of GDP through amendments to the restitution
law, and the plan is that the government repay 0.5 percent of GDP per year over 20 years. As
of 2008, €325 million had been assumed. In 2008, approximately €105 million is added on
account of pension arrears, stemming from 2002-03. The government has also decided to
compensate confiscated foreign savings of Montenegrin citizens in banks outside
Montenegro2 and for losses incurred during the pyramid-schemes (additional €17.6 and
€9.5 million euro). Debt of municipal governments is now estimated at €42.4 million,
including domestic payment arrears of €20.5 million). On the external side, The discussions
between Serbia and Montenegro on the division of external debt are not yet final, and under
the current scenario, debt equivalent to €29.8 million is added in 2009 on account of assumed
debt from the former State Union.3 As regards Paris club debt, bilateral agreements have been
signed with United States and Switzerland, while negotiations are ongoing with France,
Spain, and Holland, and premature debt repayments are planned with Great Britain and
Japan. Of the larger Paris club creditors, only an agreement with Russia remains to be
concluded. There is still uncertainty regarding debt of public enterprises from before the
reconstitution of the Union between Serbia and Montenegro that ultimately could become a
liability of the government. Net debt is estimated at 23.1 percent of GDP at end-2008, with
general government gross deposits reported at €304.3 million (9.2 percent of GDP).
3.
Under the baseline scenario, reflecting the authorities’ fiscal plans, Montenegro’s
gross debt-to-GDP ratio would increase to 52.3 percent of GDP by 2013 (Table A1). The
1

The central government, social funds (pension, health and employment) and local governments. Debt of stateowned enterprises is included only as so far it is explicitly recognized as a liability of the government.
2

This goes beyond the previous compensation that applied only to foreign savings confiscated by banks in
Montenegro, and, in principle, the Montenegro government will have a claim on the countries in which these
banks reside.

3

Debt expected to be assumed by Montenegro is toward Kuwait, Libya, Czech Republic, Slovakia and UBS
bank (API bonds).

29
primary balance is projected to worsen substantially as the current boom dissipates, and
planned tax and contribution rate cuts and capital expenditure increases are implemented.
Nominal interest rates, while low due to the high share of relatively cheap domestic and
foreign debt, are projected to reach 2 percent on account of the government taking on a
higher proportion of debt on non-IDA terms, and declining real economic growth will
moderate the automatic debt dynamics. Privatization revenues are expected to decrease
following the windfall in 2005–08.
4.
The standard stress tests were performed using the methodology adopted in July 2005
(Information Note on Modifications to the Fund’s Debt sustainability Assessment
Framework for market access Countries-http://www-imf.org/external/ np/pp/eng/
205/070105.htm), but with modifications due to data constraints. Relevant economic
information for Montenegro prior to 2002 does not exist, and estimates for 2002–07 are used
for historical averages and standard deviations.
5.
The standard stress tests exacerbate the baseline trend of increasing gross debt
(Figure A1), and the debt path is particular sensitive to growth shocks and contingent
liabilities shocks. Montenegro is, furthermore, facing large risks due to external
concentration in trade and uncertainties in real debt levels; and euroization limits the
economy’s flexibility to respond to a shock. The relatively high sensitivity to changes in
growth and fiscal policy reinforces the importance of continued structural reforms and a
prudent fiscal stance.
II. External Sustainability
6.
It has benefited from a debt restructuring by Paris Club and bilateral donors in
2003 (which almost halved external public debt to around 33 percent of GDP) and another
debt write-off by Paris Club creditors in 2006 (which contributed to total external public debt
falling to about 24 percent of GDP). The evolution of external debt has also benefited from
favorable debt dynamics over the entire period.
7.
The statistical information on private external debt is weak; however, staff and the
authorities’ estimates indicate that external private debt has been increasing rapidly since
2006 which warrants cautious monitoring. Based on available data so far, private external
debt is expected to jump from 20 percent of GDP in 2006 to 63 percent in 2008. Commercial
bank debt accounted for the bulk of the increase, with banks resorting increasingly to foreign
financing and subsidiaries of foreign banks borrowing increasingly from parent institutions.
The remainder of the increase may partly reflect hidden FDI (driven by tax considerations),
with this debt converted later into equity.
8.
The macroeconomic framework projects real growth to slow down, while the current
account situation improves with the weakening of FDI related imports and the rebound of
private savings. Under the baseline scenario, the external debt-to-GDP ratio increases from
77 percent in 2008 to 87 percent in 2011 and declines gradually thereafter as the external

30
current account deficit drops below its debt-stabilizing level. During this period, the external
public debt declines gradually from 14 percent in 2008 to 11 percent in 2013. Meanwhile, the
private sector external debt is projected to rise to 63 percent by 2008, peak at 78 percent in
2011 and decline gradually thereafter.

Annex II: Statistical Issues
(As of January 16, 2009)
A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General
Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance.
Shortcomings are most serious in national accounts statistics. While the quality and
timeliness of data reporting vary across sectors, international reporting standards have been
adopted for monetary and balance of payments statistics. Reporting of fiscal data has recently
improved but coverage is limited. The quality of the labor and wage indicators is good.
The authorities have created a statistical council to coordinate efforts to improve data quality.
These efforts need to focus on developing comprehensive source data for national accounts,
improving concepts and classification of government finance statistics, strengthening the
coverage of balance of payments transactions, and introducing sound classifications in
compiling monetary and financial statistics.
National Accounts
The Statistical Office of Montenegro (MONSTAT) compiles real sector data. MONSTAT
has started to adopt the 1993 System of National Accounts as a framework for compiling
national accounts estimates. However, the scope of the accounts is limited to compiling
annual production account in current and in previous year prices. The accuracy of the data
sources needs to be improved. The business statistics are still following the material system
product concepts, collecting data mainly on quantities produced. The national accounts
estimates depend solely on bookkeeping data. The coverage of the unincorporated sector is
not exhaustive. On the expenditure side, there are no data on changes in inventories, and the
quality of investment and merchandise trade data is unsatisfactory. National accounts data is
also undermined by the lack of sound techniques to account for unobserved activities. Some
work has been done on measuring informal activity in construction, retail trade, hotels and
restaurants, but a more comprehensive approach needs to be developed. Statistical techniques
for deriving volume measures of GDP are constrained by the lack of suitable price and
volume indices.
Price Statistics
MONSTAT compiles and disseminates monthly consumer and producer price indices, which
broadly follow international standards. In both indices, the “carry-forward” technique for
treatment of seasonal goods, new goods, and missing items are used.

5
Government Finance Statistics
Fiscal data are compiled by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) based on a new GFS institutional
classification, and since early 2006, include data for the social security funds and local
governments. The chart of accounts introduced in 2001 has been implemented at the local
level from mid-2005. Fiscal data reporting suffers from frequent re-classifications,
especially, at the level of local governments and social funds. The MOF has recently created
a unit responsible for data collection for state-owned enterprises (SOE), but a satisfactory
compilation of the public sector fiscal balance requires significant further efforts. Data on
stock of local government arrears need to be strengthened. Montenegro does not report
government finance statistics for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook
or IFS.
Monetary Statistics
Monetary and financial statistics are compiled by the Central Bank of Montenegro (CBM),
broadly following the institutional coverage, classification, and valuation methodology set
forth in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. Dissemination practices meet the
recommendations of the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) with respect to the
periodicity and timeliness for financial sector data. Beginning in early 2006, the CBM
publishes detailed monetary statistics in its monthly Statistical Bulletin, which includes tables
on monetary statistics, balance sheets and surveys for the CBM and the commercial banks.
Significant progress notwithstanding, there is need for further improvement. A 2006 mission
made recommendations on methodological issues concerning: (i) the exclusion of two banks
in bankruptcy from financial reporting (the mission proposed that if these institutions are
excluded from the coverage of the monetary survey, a separate table on their monetary
accounts could be included in the CBM’s Statistical Bulletin); and (ii) treatment of interest
accrued but not yet due (which is maintained in aggregate on separate accounts rather than
incorporated in the outstanding amount of the financial asset or liability). The recording of
Fund Accounts in the CBM’s balance sheet also needs to be reviewed for consistency with
the recommendations on accounting for transactions with the Fund that were issued by the
IMF Finance Department. Appropriate recording of Fund Accounts will permit an enhanced
compilation of monetary accounts for the CBM.
Balance of Payments
Balance of payments statistics are compiled by MONSTAT (trade statistics) and the CBM
(other current account elements, capital and financial accounts). Significant improvement is
needed in data compilation, in particular in external trade, where MONSTAT uses the special
trade system for imports, but general trade system for exports. This inconsistency may have
resulted in the overestimation of imports. In addition, the classification used by MONSTAT
is the Harmonized System (HS), but data are disseminated according to the Nomenclature
générale des Activités économiques dans les Communautés Européennes (NACE), on highly

6
aggregated groups, and with a significant time lag. Some components are likely underrecorded, since a significant proportion of foreign exchange transactions occur through
informal channels.
Data on private external debt are weak. While the CBM has continuously maintained a
record of flows of private external debt in recent years, there is no data on the stock of
external debt. The authorities’ program includes strengthening the monitoring of private
external debt by CBM and MONSTAT.
In mid-2004, a STA mission assisted CBM staff with the adoption of compilation
methodologies consistent with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5).
The mission also provided recommendations to improve international trade and external debt
statistics through the international transactions reporting system (ITRS). The authorities have
implemented many of the mission’s recommendations. Following the authorities’ request for
further assistance, a mission visited Montenegro in September – October 2007. Although it
noted substantial progress, inadequate data sources continue to constrain progress in
improving balance of payments data. The mission recommended changes on the estimates for
merchanting, transactions involving foreign assets and liabilities, and reserve assets, while
additional data needed to be collected for travel and direct investment.
B. Data Standards and Quality
Montenegro does not participate in the GDDS, but may benefit to join the GDDS and use its
framework for the overall development of the country’s statistical system.
No data ROSC is available.
C. Reporting to STA (Optional)
A page for Montenegro in International Financial Statistics (IFS) was introduced in the
March 2007 issue.
The CBM does not yet report monetary data in the format of Standardized Report Forms
(SRFs). To avoid duplication of effort, the CBM will need to decide whether to adopt the
European Central Bank’s framework for collecting, compiling and reporting monetary data
or the STA-developed SRFs, either of which will provide monetary data that accord with
international standard.
Montenegro’s balance of payments data are not yet included in International Financial
Statistics or Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook.

a year later in January 2007. Even under the umbrella of the state union of Serbia and
Montenegro, the Bank had effectively established a functional relationship with Montenegro.
The World Bank’s support complements Montenegro’s socio-economic development and
politico-economic integration goals, including those spelt out in the Stabilization and
Association Agreement (SAA) signed with the European Union (EU) in October 2007.
Montenegro is in the process of developing and/or updating its development and sectoral
strategies and integrating those into the overarching national integration program outlined in
the 2008 National Program for Integration (NPI), superseding Montenegro’s medium-term
development strategy, as contained in the 2004 Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy
(DPRS)2 and the Economic Reform Agenda.
Following independence, and against the background of accelerating growth rates, largely
fueled by a very significant inflow of foreign-direct investments, Montenegro has made
substantial progress in advancing its development goals. Euroization has contributed to
anchoring macroeconomic stability as a central pillar of economic policymaking,
complemented by programs to advance privatization, liberalization, and structural reforms—
with the aim of ensuring fiscal consolidation and promoting stronger private sector-led
growth. The prolonged debate on the Constitution, the lack of institutional capacity, and the
reorientation of policy priorities has delayed the implementation structural reforms in several
areas and led to some relaxation of fiscal policies during late 2007. Having completed the
immediate state-building tasks, the government should overcome quickly the delays in
implementing the structural reform agenda.
World Bank Group Strategy
A Joint World Bank-IFC Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Montenegro, covering
FY07–10 and endorsed by the Bank’s Board on June 12, 2007, supports the government’s
key priorities—viz., to (i) enhance sustainable economic growth, through increasing
economic freedoms and strengthening the role of the private sector; (ii) build institutions and
the rule of law; and (iii) improve the standard of living of citizens, through efficient
education, health and social protection systems. A CPS progress report is scheduled to be
presented to the World Bank Boards of Executive Directors in early 2009.

The Document was presented to the Board as self-standing part of the joint Serbia and Montenegro Poverty
Reduction Strategy.

9
Coordination with the IMF has been strong, with cooperation having focused on
macroeconomic issues and sectoral ones with a potentially strong macroeconomic impact—
more important still after the government’s decision in mid-2007 not to request a Fundsupported program and in light of the increased risks to macroeconomic stability. The Bank,
through its ongoing and planned operations, as well its complementary economic and sector
work, will continue to provide input on issues such as (i) labor market reforms; (ii) energy
sector reforms; (iii) public expenditure, pension and health reforms, with a view to
streamlining service delivery, and (iv) an appropriate framework to regulate concession
arrangements and potential public/private partnerships, with a view to encouraging
investment in a way that would ensure that the government does not accumulate significant
contingent liabilities. The Fund has been part of the review process for the second volume of
the Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR), scheduled to be published in late
2008.
Total outstanding debt of Montenegro towards the various part of the Bank, as of November
12, 2008, was US$314.9 million (US$68.4 million for IDA and US$246.6 million for IBRD).
In 2007, the government prepaid €60 million.
World Bank Activities
The 2007 CPS envisages a total lending envelope of US$70–90 million (see table below).
Following the successful completion, in 2006, of the Second Structural Adjustment Credit
(SAC 2), the government decided not to request a follow-up development policy credit,
largely because of Montenegro’s strengthened fiscal position. Investments aim at fostering
private-sector activities and streamlining social services, while maintaining a quality
environmental infrastructure that is required for sustainable growth in tourism (a key
industry).

The Montenegro Environmentally Sensitive Tourist Areas Project is to create ecological and
commercially sustainable solid waste collection and disposal services in Montenegro coastal
municipalities, needed to maintain a clean, environmentally attractive coastal area. This is to
be achieved through the (i) development of the sector’s institutional, policy and regulatory
framework; (ii) rehabilitation of municipal disposal sites to function as properly designed
regional sanitary landfills; (iii) closing existing disposal sites in an environmentally
acceptable manner; (iv) provision of modern collection equipment; (v) initiating a pilot
recycling campaign; and (vi) strengthening multi-municipal joint companies (MJC) that will
be created to operate the two regional solid waste disposal systems.
The Healthcare System Improvement Project seeks to put in place first steps toward a
reformed healthcare system to increase the capacity for policy, planning, and regulation,
stabilize healthcare financing, and improve primary healthcare service delivery. The
implementation is proceeding well, and government ownership is strong. The Health
Ministry has succeeded in securing CIDA grant funds to co-finance the project.
With the Pension System Investment Administration Project, Montenegro seeks to improve
the financial sustainability, effectiveness, and efficiency of the pension system—by
(i) developing a unified contribution collection and reporting system and establishing central
registries that are based on modern information technology and processes; (ii) modernizing
and restructuring, as needed, the organization, processes, and technology in the Department
of Public Revenue and the Pension Fund; and (iii) developing capacity for better policy
design and analysis of the pension system and improving the readiness for future pension
reforms.
Streamlining social services is a particular challenge given the relatively large cost of social
services as a proportion of GDP, even when compared to neighboring countries with similar
income levels. The Montenegro Education Reform Project aims at strengthening the capacity
of the education system to make continuous improvements, especially in the quality of
teaching and learning in schools and in the efficient use of budgetary resources. There is a
high degree of government ownership and no problems in project implementation.
The Montenegro Sustainable Tourism Development Project is to help Montenegro to better
design and implement an integrated coastal zone management approach. With this, coastal
degradation is to be reduced and environmentally sound tourism development fostered by
supporting activities aimed at (i) enhancing spatial development, the use of natural resources,
regulatory policy, institutional capacity and governance of the coastal zone, and (ii) initiating
priority investments to improve environmental conditions and foster development of highquality tourism. These objectives will be achieved through (i) improvements in land-use
planning and protection to guard against uncontrolled construction and development; and
(ii) investments for the Continental and Southern part of the Regional Water Supply Scheme
with the capacity to provide water from Lake Skadar/Shkodër to the municipalities of Bar

11
and Ulcinj/Ulqin and the tourist areas of Valdanos and Velika Plaža. This phase of the
MSTDP will only finance the investments from Lake Skadar/Shkodër to Bar.
The Energy Community of South East Europe-APL3 Montenegro Project is awaiting
effectiveness. Procurement activities for the projects have started. The General Procurement
Notice is prepared and about to be published, while EPCG is finalizing the technical
specifications for the projects and is planning to issue tender documents of some of these
projects by end-December 2007. In addition, Bank teams have discussed an Energy
Efficiency Project, planned for FY09, to support financing related projects in the public
sector, especially in the education and health sectors. The Bank team has agreed with
government representatives on next steps for further assessment of prospects and scope of
energy efficiency investments in public sector buildings.
In addition, the Bank approved in May 2008 a US$4.6 million Global Environment Facility
(GEF) grant—US$2.0 million for Albania and US$2.6 million for Montenegro—for the joint
Albania-Montenegro Lake Skadar/Shkodër Integrated Ecosystem Management Project. The
funds are to help both countries to manage Lake Skadar/Shkodër more efficiently and in a
more environmentally-safe manner by promoting sustainable development, with a special
focus on tourism and fisheries that are to help to encourage action on some priority pollution
sites. Two further GEF grant applications have been made by Bank teams within the context
of the MIDAS and MSTDP projects, respectively. A PRS Trust Fund has been implemented
during 2008, while one study financed by the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility
(PPIAF) has been prepared and another is in preparation.
The Bank’s assistance has been supported by a standard package of analytical and advisory
activities. A CPAR and a CFAA were delivered in 2002, followed by a PEIR and a Poverty
Assessment in 2003. A Montenegro Economic Memorandum was completed in 2005 and
focused on macroeconomic issues (particularly public expenditure), labor market reform, the
business climate and also synthesized findings of supporting studies of energy. A PEIR
(2006), a Debt Sustainability Analysis (2007), a Poverty Assessment Update (2008), two
FSAPs (2006, 2008), and an Accounting and Auditing ROSC (2007) were completed. A
second PEIR is scheduled to be published in late 2008.
FIAS assisted the self-assessment of administrative procedures for Doing Business which
identified several major areas of concern: complex procedures for registration of enterprises,
along with the lack of funds as well as shortcomings in the legal framework for competition
and management of public and private enterprises.
MIGA, with EAR support, is implementing a capacity building project in support of the new
Montenegrin Investment Promotion Agency. MIGA’s TA activities are feeding into a new,
regional FDI outreach and marketing initiative for the Western Balkans launched in summer
2004 (the European Investor Outreach Program for the Western Balkans).

12
IFC has also provided $5.2 million through Opportunity Bank Montenegro to expand microand small-business enterprise loan portfolio. In addition, IFC has provided support through
its Southeast European Enterprise Development (SEED) facility, later transformed into
Private Enterprise Partnership of Southeast Europe (PEPSE) and assisted in introduction of
Financial Leasing Law through its Leasing Project.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
Republic of Montenegro
On February 23, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Republic of Montenegro. 1
Background
Montenegro has made significant progress in overhauling its economy, and has been
rewarded for this by strong foreign investor interest. As a result, the economy has
boomed in recent years, stimulated by large foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows and
high credit growth, with GDP growth averaging 7 percent from 2004–08. However, the
boom has also generated large macroeconomic imbalances, and the country is highly
exposed to the rapidly dimming global environment.
The current account deficit is estimated to have risen to 31 percent of GDP in 2008,
driven primarily by very low private sector savings and facilitated by rapid credit
expansion. Gross FDI inflows moderated in 2008 as investment opportunities narrowed
while the share of private external borrowing, particularly by banks, has risen rapidly.
Strong wage growth has also been eroding external competitiveness.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
Financial sector vulnerabilities are substantial. Banks’ non-performing loans have been
rising strongly, and there is a substantial exposure to the rapidly cooling construction
sector. Banking system dependence on foreign financing inflows from parent banks is
also high. Public confidence remains fragile, and bank deposits are declining. Private
sector credit growth decelerated to 23 percent in 2008 (compared to the record high
173 percent in 2007) reflecting prudential tightening measures, lower risk appetite and
declining deposits.
However, the authorities have taken several welcome steps to help strengthen financial
sector stability, beefing up banks’ capital and liquidity buffers, introducing a blanket
deposit guarantee, providing liquidity support and pledging public funds for bank
recapitalization. Also, all parent banks have supported their subsidiaries with additional
funding thus far, thus partly offsetting the drain on deposits.
On the fiscal side, after substantial improvement during the boom years the surplus is
estimated to have declined considerably to 1½ percent of GDP in 2008. While strong
demand kept taxes buoyant, the surplus shrank due primarily to cuts to social
contribution rates, a 30 percent hike in public sector wages and increased transfers.
Plans for cuts in tax and social contribution rates and increases in capital and social
expenditure will substantially increase the deficit in 2009 and beyond, implying a risk of
rapidly rising public debt. Moreover, there are substantial contingent liabilities linked to
the blanket guarantee of bank deposits, potential recapitalization of banks, the
lossmaking aluminum company, and longer term aging pressures.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the structural reforms implemented over the past few
years and financial integration that have helped Montenegro attract substantial foreign
direct investment and generate rapid growth with moderate inflation. Fiscal surpluses
were achieved in past years, allowing a decline in gross public debt. Directors noted
favorably the recent application for EU membership and negotiations to join the WTO.
Directors observed, nevertheless, that global financial deleveraging and the recession in
advanced economies will have a substantial adverse impact on economic activity in
Montenegro and cause a rise in financial, external, and fiscal vulnerabilities. Against this
background, Directors agreed that it will be important to maintain financial sector stability
and fiscal sustainability, while continuing the structural reform momentum. With
euroization, the burden on fiscal policy—the only available macroeconomic instrument—
is greater to strike the proper balance in supporting economic activity, assisting the
financial sector, and securing medium-term sustainability.

3
Most Directors recognized that the already large structural fiscal deficit and the
overhang of contingent liabilities related to the financial sector constrain the scope for
fiscal stimulus in 2009. Considering fiscal multipliers to be low in a small, open
economy, most Directors called for reconsideration of the planned cuts in taxes and
contribution rates. Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to reduce current
spending to create fiscal space and, if the economic outlook deteriorates further, to
scale back lower-priority capital expenditures. Directors generally encouraged the
authorities to better anchor medium-term fiscal sustainability by adopting a target for net
public debt and by the welcomed intention to create a medium-term expenditure
framework.
Directors supported the authorities’ actions to bolster financial system stability and
reduce vulnerabilities by intensifying supervisory oversight, tightening prudential
regulations, and lifting bank capitalization requirements. They welcomed efforts to
improve systemic liquidity management and to reach agreements with parent banks and
home supervisors related to possible liquidity and solvency problems. Directors
recommended strengthening further the enforcement powers of the central bank.
Directors noted the staff’s assessment that the real effective exchange rate was broadly
aligned with fundamentals. They also underscored the importance of continued
structural reform for raising potential growth and increasing the economy’s resiliency to
shocks. While welcoming the new labor market legislation, Directors encouraged further
measures to make the labor market flexible and to encourage job creation and longerterm employment. They supported efforts to reduce red tape at the central government
level to improve the business climate, and recommended that similar steps be taken at
the municipal level. They endorsed renewed efforts to reform the electricity sector.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue their efforts to improve the supply and
quality of statistical data.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Age Bakker, Executive Director for Republic of Montenegro
and Svetlana Cerovic, Advisor to Executive Director
February 23, 2009
The Montenegrin authorities would like to thank staff for the open and constructive dialogue
during the mission. The authorities broadly agree with staff’s analysis and share staff’s views
regarding the economic challenges ahead.
Macroeconomic developments and outlook
The Montenegrin economy has achieved impressive results over the past several years.
Ambitious structural reforms, substantial capital inflows, dynamic developments in the
banking sector, and strong fiscal performance positioned Montenegro as one of the fastest
growing European countries. Average annual GDP growth in the last four years was around
8 percent. However, as a small, open economy, Montenegro is not immune to global
economic developments. As for the region as a whole, the severe global economic crisis has
begun to spill over to the country, particularly since the last quarter of 2008.
Through most of 2008 there have been strong FDI inflows, helped by restructuring of large
public enterprises, and passage of several systemic laws (Labor Law, Banking Law).
Employment also remained on an upward trend, with the unemployment rate approaching a
single digit. Inflation picked up in the middle of the year, but has eased since then, although
slowly, because the decline in food and oil prices was partly offset by further liberalization of
electricity prices. The application for EU membership was submitted in December, and the
negotiations for joining the WTO are in the final stage, confirming the authorities’ objective
of integrating the country into European-Atlantic structures.
The sudden recent drop in aluminum prices, combined with a substantial drop in global
demand, affected production in the largest aluminum exporting company. Capital inflows
also slowed down, demonstrating that the economy has started to adjust to new external
developments. The banking sector came under pressure in October, when households, still
with memories of the financial failure in the 1990s, withdrew some of their deposits. The
authorities promptly reacted with a set of measures directed to secure confidence in the
banking system.
Noting the difficulties in capturing the total effects of the global crisis, and in that respect the
FDI inflows, macroeconomic projections inevitably have a high degree of uncertainty. The
difficulties of projections are particularly pronounced in a small economy such as
Montenegro, where a few large investment projects can make a significant difference. While
recognizing the downward risks, the authorities developed two scenarios, more and less
optimistic. The authorities are well aware of the challenges ahead, and economic policy for
this year is focused on attracting FDI and avoiding a hard landing and negative effects of the
crisis. They are monitoring the situation closely and regularly consult Fund staff.

2
Fiscal policy
Fiscal policy in 2008 was in line with medium and long-term objectives related to improving
the business environment, stepping up public institution reforms and nation building, and
improving public infrastructure. In addition, on account of the catching-up process with the
private sector, an increase in public-sector wages was observed. A stronger than expected
budgetary performance led to a higher than targeted surplus which, even after the
intervention to alleviate vulnerabilities in the banking system, reached 1.5 percent of GDP.
One of the issues highlighted in the staff report and extensively discussed during the mission
is the scope for countercyclical fiscal policy for 2009. The authorities are of the view that
spillover from global markets, liquidity shortages, and limitations of the monetary policy due
to the euroized economy, make countercyclical fiscal policy inevitable. In that respect, the
budget for this year introduced various stimulative measures against the cyclical downturn.
These measures mainly fall into three broad categories:
1) Support to households and individuals: through personal income tax and social
contribution cuts that will have multiplicative effects on the economy, subsidies on electricity
prices to the most vulnerable population categories, prepayment of internal debt payable by
restitution and old savings;
2) Acceleration of investments in infrastructure, including the main national projects;
3) Support the business environment by decreasing the price of electricity for SMEs, through
reduction of tax claims to EPCG, and guaranteeing bank borrowing from international
financial institutions to support small and medium-size enterprises. The budget also includes
the abolition of some fees. Implementation of the project “Job for you” is also envisaged.
The project focuses on ensuring easier access to funding sources through an active
employment policy for vulnerable categories of the population.
At the same time, in order to create space to support these measures, the budget envisages a
cut in current spending for materials and services. Should the economic outlook deteriorate,
and downside risks materialize, resulting in significantly lower than planned budget
revenues, an alternative fiscal scenario will be implemented. The alternative scenario, with a
deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP (significantly lower than staff’s projection), envisages the
reduction of capital expenditures, based on priorities. In fact, the planned large capital
expenditures over the medium term provide room for quick and immediate adjustments.
Moreover, tight financial conditions on domestic and international markets limit the
possibilities for financing large deficits, and in that respect restrain significant deterioration
of the debt-to-GDP position in the medium term.

3
Financial sector
Montenegro’s financial sector has not avoided the global financial crisis, but has so far
withstood the turbulence. The authorities’ response to the financial crisis has been prudent
and systematic since its outbreak. In October 2008, following the intensification of global
financial instability, the authorities adopted measures to preserve the stability of the financial
system, protect savers, and maintain adequate levels of bank liquidity. With respect to these
measures, the government made debt prepayments to banks, in order to boost their liquidity,
and a collateralized loan was provided to one bank. Pressures have alleviated, and there were
no other requests for the use of measures and mechanisms provided by the Law on the
Protection of the Banking Sector. Foreign banks’ ownership is dominant in the Montenegrin
banking system, and all parent banks have so far provided additional liquidity to their
subsidiaries.
The banking sector grew substantially in 2007. To protect the system from risks stemming
from rapid credit growth, the CBM implemented a set of prudent measures at the beginning
of 2008. The solvency ratio was increased, ceilings on credit growth were introduced, and the
reserve requirement base was broadened. Besides, the Credit Registry that enabled banks and
micro-credit financial institutions to gain insight into the indebtedness of legal entities and
private individuals, became operable. These actions prevented banks from pursuing more
risky strategies, and created buffers for the turbulent developments on the international
financial markets. Furthermore, the new Law on Banks, adopted in March last year, foresees
a compulsory capital increase of banks within a one-year period. The capital increase will
additionally strengthen the banking system and increase its capability to face various
potential shocks that the system may be exposed to in the future.
The authorities appreciate the Fund’s advice on contingency planning. Having implemented
the FSAP recommendations, they requested a follow-up mission on crisis preparedness and
management. Based on MCM’s recommendations, the CBM, the Ministry of Finance and the
Deposits Insurance Agency agreed to closely work together, each within their respective
roles and with their own responsibilities, in maintaining financial stability. Moreover, by the
end of the year, the authorities plan to revise the banking and bankruptcy law to address
some of the issues raised by the mission team.
Structural reforms
The authorities remain committed to continuing the structural reform agenda, and ensuring
sustainable economic growth in the long run. The adoption of the new Labor Law, which
incorporates EU directives and International Labor Organization (ILO) conventions, provides
for a more flexible and competitive labor market. While there is still room to increase
flexibility and improve legislation in this area, a large seasonal inflow of foreign workers
confirms that the labor market in Montenegro is very open.

4
The authorities attach great importance to comprehensive energy sector reforms, and they
remain committed to unbundling the EPCG. The activities in 2008 were primarily focused on
establishing preconditions for a full legal and ownership unbundling. As a result of these
activities in the unbundling process, a newly established transmission company shall start to
operate as of April this year. At the beginning of February this year, the authorities launched
a tender for sale and recapitalization of the EPCG, allowing strategic partners to become
shareholders of 18 percent of the total share capital. The process is planned to be finalized in
the third quarter of this year. The strategic investor will be allowed to acquire majority
control in EPCG in the next five years, under the condition of implementing the investment
program. The authorities are of the view that this approach will create increased efficiency
and profitability of EPCG.
