Executive Summary
Background and outlook
The economy is showing signs of overheating owing to high oil prices and a significant policy
stimulus. Real GDP is estimated to have grown by 6.6 percent in 2007/08 (fiscal year ends on
March 20), and gross official reserves reached $82 billion (12 months of imports) by the end of the
fiscal year. Inflation rose to 24.2 percent in April 2008, owing mainly to an expansionary credit
policy and a significant, albeit recently reduced, fiscal stimulus. Unemployment has declined only
slightly, against the background of an uneven pace of structural reforms.
The short-term growth outlook is good, but on current policies the staff envisages that inflation
would remain at about 25 percent. Over the medium term, real GDP growth is projected to moderate
to 4–5 percent a year, in part reflecting stagnant oil production. The medium-term external position
is very sensitive to the oil price assumptions.
Authorities’ views
Reducing inflation. The authorities indicated that efforts to reduce inflation would focus on
slowing expenditure growth and containing credit expansion through moral suasion on banks to
reduce lending to low-priority sectors.
Strengthening the public finances. Fiscal reform plans under discussion include phasing out
energy and nonenergy subsidies, streamlining the public administration, and strengthening revenue
collection.
Stepping up structural reforms. Structural reform priorities include recapitalizing large stateowned banks and privatizing smaller banks, intensifying divestment efforts, aligning customs
procedures with WTO standards, and improving the business climate.
Staff recommendations
•

Macroeconomic policies need to be significantly tightened to lower inflation. In particular, there
is a need to further reduce budgetary expenditure in 2008/09, and promptly increase banking
rates of return and allow for nominal exchange rate appreciation.

•

A decisive implementation of the envisaged fiscal reforms will help achieve further fiscal
consolidation in the medium term, which is needed to reduce inflation and increase the
economy’s resilience in case of a decline in oil prices.

•

Eliminating administrative controls, gearing the divestment process to private investors,
reducing trade protection, and improving the business climate and the labor legislation will
boost the economy’s growth potential and employment creation.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Iran is endowed with vast hydrocarbon resources, but its capacity to increase
hydrocarbon production is limited. In 2006, Iran had the second largest proven oil and gas
reserves, and it was the fourth largest oil producer in the world. However, its oil production
has remained virtually flat in recent years and will most likely stagnate in the medium term
due to insufficient investment.

2.
Iran has the largest economy in purchasing power parity terms in the Middle
East and Central Asia (MCD) region, with a sizeable and diversified non-oil sector
(Figure 1). Iran’s economy is closely linked to intraregional trade and capital flows. On the
one hand, Iran has benefited from rapid growth in the MCD region by increasing its regional
non-oil exports. On the other, Iran’s robust growth in recent years has had some positive
impact on smaller Gulf Cooperation Council countries serving as transit points for Iranian
imports and trade financing.
3.
Fund policy advice has focused on measures to reduce inflation and structural
reforms aimed at stimulating growth and employment creation. Consistent with Fund
recommendations, in 2007/08 the authorities reduced the non-oil fiscal deficit, contained
energy subsidies, improved revenue administration, and intensified their efforts to bring
banking supervision closer to international standards. However, there has been no political
consensus to implement other Fund recommendations such as tightening monetary policy and
reducing government interference in resource allocation.

Against the background of strong demand pressures and an uneven pace of
structural reforms, the consultation discussions focused on

Policies to reduce inflation,

•

Medium-term fiscal challenges, and

II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
5.
Real GDP growth is estimated to have picked up to 6.6 percent in 2007/08, from
6.2 percent in 2006/07. Increased direct government support to priority sectors, scaled-up
budgetary capital expenditure, and strong credit growth underpinned a robust and broadbased growth of the non-oil economy. Oil production, however, increased modestly, mainly
owing to insufficient investment (Figure 2 and Table 1).
6.
Intensified international pressures on Iran have negatively affected economic
activity. UN and U.S. sanctions against certain Iranian institutions have created difficulties
for trade financing and payments, discouraged foreign investment, and adversely affected the
profitability of the targeted financial institutions.
7.
Reducing unemployment has remained a challenge. The officially reported
unemployment rate declined only marginally to 9.8 percent in the year to December 2007, in
part reflecting a decline in the labor participation rate.
8.
Inflation has been on the rise. Expansionary policies against the background of
capacity constraints and to some extent rising import prices caused 12-month CPI inflation to
increase to 24.2 percent in April 2008, from 16.8 percent in April 2007. CPI inflation
excluding food and energy also increased to more than 20 percent in April 2008, suggesting
strong underlying domestic demand pressures.1
9.
High oil prices supported a further strengthening of Iran’s external position in
2007/08. The current account surplus is estimated to have increased from 9.2 percent of GDP
in 2006/07 to 10.2 percent in 2007/08 (Table 2). Notwithstanding large capital outflows
($5.5 billion in 2007/08), gross official reserves, including the Oil Stabilization Fund’s (OSF)
foreign assets, increased from $61 billion (10 months of imports) at end-2006/07 to
$82 billion (almost 12 months of imports) at end-2007/08.

1

Price controls contained the rise in CPI inflation: in 2007/08, the annual average increase in administered
prices, accounting for about 12 percent of the CPI basket, was about 10 percent, compared with a 19 percent
increase in the CPI.

Despite recent rapid real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciation, the
tradable non-oil sectors have performed relatively well (Figure 3). This could be
explained by some initial currency undervaluation (Box), increased subsidies, and the rapid
growth in trading partner countries. In addition, import-substituting manufacturing has
benefited from relatively high import tariffs.
Box. Assessing Iran’s REER Level
Staff estimates under the equilibrium real exchange rate approach (ERER) suggest that the
REER was slightly undervalued in 2006/07. MCD countries’ panel mean estimates suggest a
5 percent undervaluation. The panel covers the period 1986–2006 and includes the following
explanatory variables: relative productivity, the fiscal balance, the cumulative current account
balance, the terms of trade, and a trade openness indicator.
Some panel estimates for MCD oil-producing countries based on the macroeconomic balance
approach show a significant exchange rate overvaluation, reflecting the fact that Iran has
lower current account surpluses than many other oil-producing countries (Figure 4). However,
it is reasonable to expect that Iran should generate lower current account surpluses than the
macroeconomic balance approach would suggest because its oil wealth relative to its economy
is larger than that of many other oil-producing countries. Since oil wealth is not included in the
list of dependent variables, the existing estimates of current account norms for the panel of oilproducing countries are not suitable for Iran.

11.
Fiscal policy was tightened in 2007/08 following a significant fiscal relaxation
during 2005/06–2006/07. The non-oil primary fiscal deficit rose from about 15 percent of
GDP in 2004/05 to 21 percent in 2006/07, as the government increased transfers to
households, subsidies, capital expenditure, and OSF lending (Figure 5 and Tables 3–4).2 The
non-oil primary deficit, however, is estimated to have been reduced to 17 percent of GDP in
2007/08 through the rationing of subsidized gasoline, a reduction in nonwage current outlays,
more moderate growth of capital expenditure, and a decline in OSF lending.
12.
The Central Bank of Iran’s (CBI) ability to influence monetary policy decisions
has been further curtailed. In 2007/08, the Monetary and Credit Council chaired by the CBI
Governor was integrated into the government’s supreme council for economic management
and planning.
2

The OSF was set up in 2000 to reduce the impact of oil price volatility on expenditure. Revenues in excess
of budgeted amounts are deposited in the OSF. Up to 50 percent of OSF resources can be on-lent to domestic
companies via banks. The remaining assets are deposited at the CBI, which manages them together with official
reserves.

Credit conditions were loosened in 2007/08 and the rial continued to depreciate,
albeit at a slower pace. Faced with a reduction in budgetary expenditure and OSF lending,
both private and state-owned enterprises intensified pressures for increased bank credit. The
government’s decision to reduce banking rates of return in mid-2007/08 exacerbated these
pressures.3 To satisfy the growing demand for loans, state-owned commercial banks
increasingly resorted to the CBI overdraft facility. As a result, the CBI’s claims on banks
became one of the main sources of money and credit growth (Figure 6 and Tables 5–6). A net
redemption of Central Bank Participation Papers (CBPPs) and net purchases of foreign
exchange were additional sources of liquidity growth. The authorities continued to target a slow
rial depreciation vis-à-vis a basket of currencies, but the weight of the U.S. dollar in the basket
was significantly reduced in late November 2007. As a result, the monthly depreciation of the
nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) has recently declined (Figure 7).
14.
The deepening of financial intermediation has slowed down and dollarization has
increased recently. As real rates of return on domestic currency deposits became increasingly
negative, the inflow of rial deposits into the domestic banking system began to slow down in
2007/08. At the same time, relative returns on foreign currency deposits became more
attractive, which led to a significant rise in dollarization, albeit from a low base.
Notwithstanding the sharp increase in foreign currency deposits, the velocity of broad money
(including foreign exchange deposits) remained unchanged in 2007/08, in contrast with a
significant decline in previous years. The securities market has remained relatively modest.
15.
The legislative framework for banking supervision has continued to improve, but
some banking system vulnerabilities persist. The CBI approved new regulations on asset
classification, provisioning, and banks’ investment, and issued new guidelines on liquidity
management and internal controls. While an anti-money laundering (AML) law became
effective in January 2008, the law still contains deficiencies and its implementation will require
the adoption of detailed regulations. In addition, Iran does not currently have in place an

The rate of return on transaction contracts was reduced from 14 percent to 12 percent in state-owned banks and
from 17 percent to 13 percent in private banks. The minimum expected rate of return on profit-and-loss-sharing
(PLS) contracts was set at the same level. In April 2008, average lending rates for PLS contracts were estimated at
about 16 percent for state-owned banks and at 22–23 percent for private banks, below the current inflation rate.

appropriate framework to counter the financing of terrorism (CFT). Regarding banking
system indicators, the nonperforming loans ratio increased to about 16 percent at end-March
2007 (Table 7), and as mentioned earlier, the profitability of banks under sanctions has been
adversely affected. Against this background, the authorities have recently recapitalized three
state-owned banks by transforming OSF deposits funding loans to domestic enterprises
($3 billion, about 1 percent of GDP) into government equity. However, some state-owned
banks were still undercapitalized as of end-March 2008.

Progress on other structural reforms has been uneven. The increase in implicit
energy subsidies was contained through the rationing of gasoline at higher prices. In addition,
the preparatory technical and legislative work for implementing the VAT is close to
completion, and tax collection agencies have been upgraded with new IT technology.
Following the 2006 reinterpretation of Article 44 of the Constitution, the divestment process
has gathered pace. However, given the lack of large private investors, many governmentowned entities were acquired through noncash or deferred settlements by quasi-public sector
institutions. Furthermore, remaining weaknesses in the business climate, in particular in the
areas of employing workers and dealing with licenses, constitute an obstacle to private sector
development and employment creation (Figure 8).

III. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK
A. Baseline Scenario
17.
Iran’s short-term growth and external prospects are good. Real GDP growth is
projected to remain robust at 5.7 percent in 2008/09, despite a drought-related slowdown in
agriculture. Notwithstanding buoyant domestic demand, the external current account surplus
would be broadly unchanged at 9–10 percent of GDP in 2008/09, as oil prices are projected
to remain well above their 2007/08 level.
18.
Inflationary pressures are likely to persist in 2008/09. A projected widening of the
non-oil primary fiscal deficit and increasingly negative real rates of return would fuel
domestic demand growth. The staff believes that this, together with some exchange rate
depreciation, would cause inflation to remain at about 25 percent in 2008/09. The balance of
risks to this forecast is slanted to the upside, given a probable further reduction in regulated
rates of return and a potential intensification of the financial disintermediation process.
19.
Medium-term prospects are very sensitive to the oil price assumptions. The staff
discussed with the authorities an illustrative medium-term baseline scenario based on the
continuation of the government’s current policies. This scenario assumes that prices for
Iranian crude remain at $85–$90 per barrel,4 reforms advance unevenly, double-digit inflation
persists, and oil production stagnates. Under such a scenario, Iran’s growth potential would
dwindle, a budget deficit most likely requiring CBI financing would emerge, and the
economy’s vulnerability to a possible fall in oil prices would increase. Specifically, real GDP
growth is projected to decelerate to about 4½ percent a year by 2013/14, while the external
current account and budget positions would be in deficit by 2012/13, mainly reflecting flat oil
export volumes (Figure 9 and Table 8).
20.
The sensitivity analysis demonstrates upside and downside risks to the baseline
medium-term outlook. Should oil prices for Iranian crude stay above $110 per barrel, in line
with the current WEO forecast, Iran would continue to register significant current account
surpluses and would accumulate about $190 billion of gross official reserves by end-2013/14.
However, if oil prices for Iranian crude fell to $75 per barrel, the country would register
current account deficits in the medium term, which would be unsustainable because of Iran’s
limited access to international financial markets (Figure 9).

4

This oil price range is consistent with the Spring 2008 WEO assumptions circulated at the time of the
consultation mission.

B. Recommended Scenario
21.
The staff has also prepared an illustrative active scenario for 2008/09. It assumes
a reduction in the non-oil primary fiscal deficit and a tightening of monetary policy supported
by greater exchange rate flexibility. These measures would help slow domestic demand
growth and contain the annual increase in M1 to 18–20 percent,5 which would contribute to
reducing inflation to about 20 percent by end-2008/09. While the recommended adjustment
would involve some output cost, delaying it beyond 2008/09 would entrench inflationary
expectations, further increasing adjustment costs (Table 1).
22.
The medium-term outlook is significantly more favorable under the illustrative
active scenario because of further gains in macroeconomic stabilization and stepped-up
structural reforms. This active scenario assumes further fiscal consolidation and the
implementation of key structural reforms, including (i) the phasing out of energy subsidies;6
(ii) a further strengthening of revenue administration; (iii) the adoption of a rolling mediumterm fiscal framework and the integration of OSF expenditure with the central government
budget;7 (iv) the liberalization of the financial sector; and (v) measures to improve the
business climate. As a result of these reforms, real GDP growth could increase to 7–8 percent
a year, inflation would decline gradually to single digits, developmental and social budgetary
spending would increase, and both the external current account and budget balances would
remain in surplus, reducing the economy’s vulnerability to a potential decline in oil prices
(Figure 9 and Table 8).

5

Econometric evidence identifies a close link between M1 and inflation; and the recent decline in local currency
deposit growth is much more pronounced for time deposits than for sight deposits, suggesting that M1 is a better
intermediate target than M2 (see Selected Issues Paper “Forecasting Inflation in the Islamic Republic of Iran”).

21
IV. THE AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS
A. Policies to Reduce Inflation
23.
The authorities expressed concern regarding the recent rise in inflation. They
acknowledged that rapid domestic demand growth was an important factor driving inflation,
but argued that higher import prices and international sanctions were significant cost-push
factors. Against this background, the authorities stressed that they would seek to reduce
inflation without undermining their short-term growth and employment objectives.
24.
The authorities recognized that the fiscal relaxation envisaged for 2008/09 would
exacerbate domestic demand pressures. The approved 2008/09 budget is expected to result
in an increase in the non-oil primary fiscal deficit from 17 percent of GDP in 2007/08 to
20 percent in 2008/09. Capital expenditure, transfers to the National Iranian Oil Company
(NIOC), and OSF lending are budgeted to increase significantly. At the same time, non-oil
revenue is expected to decline owing to a temporary revenue loss from the switch from the
sales tax to the VAT and lower dividends from state-owned enterprises.
25.
The authorities indicated that the budget outcome in 2008/09 was likely to be
stronger, which would help contain domestic demand growth. They thought that non-oil
revenue would be above budget expectations on account of higher-than-expected inflation,
while capital expenditure would be reduced by 30 percent based on a recent government
circular. However, the authorities acknowledged that part of the savings from lower capital
outlays might need to be reallocated to current outlays due to a very tight current expenditure
envelope budgeted for 2008/09. All in all, based on the existing measures, the non-oil
primary deficit could be limited to 18.5 percent of GDP in 2008/09. In addition, further
expenditure reductions may be considered. The authorities also indicated that OSF foreign
exchange lending would be spared from the expenditure cuts because it was used for import
financing and had a limited impact on liquidity conditions.
26.
There are significant uncertainties regarding the direction of monetary policy.
The government called for a further reduction in banking rates of return to support growth
and employment creation. Following strong CBI opposition to this step, banking rates of
return have remained on hold so far. At the same time, in recognition of the need to contain
banks’ overdrafts and credit growth, the government endorsed the CBI’s proposal to intensify
moral suasion on banks to redirect lending from retail trade and purchases of existing housing
units to agriculture, industry, and construction. In addition, the outstanding stock of CBPPs
will be reduced because it was deemed that CBI operations in the nascent interbank market
would be more effective in mopping up excess liquidity.

22
27.
The authorities are evaluating whether the current exchange rate policy of slow
depreciation strikes the appropriate balance between competitiveness and disinflation.
They felt that some nominal depreciation would help slow down the ongoing rapid REER
appreciation, at least in the short term. At the same time, the authorities acknowledged that
this objective may conflict with the goal of containing liquidity growth and imported
inflation, and indicated that they would undertake a comprehensive study on the benefits and
risks of allowing a nominal appreciation of the rial. The authorities also characterized Iran’s
foreign exchange regime as a managed float (rather than a crawling peg) on the grounds that
they adjust the exchange rate based on a set of economic fundamentals, and these adjustments
are not automatic.
B. Medium-Term Issues
28.
The authorities are working on the design of a number of important reforms
that would improve the economy’s growth potential. Priority will be given to developing
the non-oil economy and increasing its overall efficiency. In addition, efforts will be made to
attract more foreign investment to both the oil and non-oil sectors. The authorities also noted
that, even in the absence of significant foreign investment in the oil sector, oil production
could still be increased at a pace that would be sufficient to cover domestic demand and
ensure adequate foreign exchange receipts.
Fiscal policy
29.
The authorities are preparing far-reaching fiscal reforms. In particular, the
government is finalizing a reform package aimed at phasing out explicit and implicit energy
subsidies, as well as budgetary non-energy subsidies, and replacing them with targeted social
assistance. Other planned fiscal reforms include a streamlining of the public administration to
reduce the wage bill and a broadening of the tax base through revenue administration
measures. The authorities would also examine the merits of moving from the current system
of five-year fiscal planning to a rolling medium-term fiscal framework.
30.
The authorities were broadly satisfied with the current institutional set-up of the
OSF. They did not see a need for shifting OSF lending to the budget because most of this
lending, in their opinion, was done on commercial or near-commercial terms and de facto
replaced foreign credit lines to finance imports in the context of intensified sanctions. The
authorities agreed that the transparency of the OSF could be further improved by publishing
summary annual reports on a dedicated website.
Financial sector
31.
The authorities will continue to support large state-owned banks and seek to
privatize smaller banks. They plan to inject about $10 billion of additional capital into the

23
remaining under-capitalized state-owned banks by converting OSF deposits with these banks
into equity. They have also slated two mid-sized banks for divestment and intend to re-invest
the related proceeds to strengthen their capital. The authorities indicated that they would
continue to regulate rates of return and sectoral credit allocation in the banking system in
order to ensure that priority sectors have access to borrowing at rates of return consistent with
their profitability.
32.
The authorities noted that they would aim at enhancing the attractiveness of the
domestic securities market. To this end, they are working on a new regulation on corporate
governance for companies listed in the Tehran Stock Exchange and on amendments to the
regulation on foreign portfolio investment.
33.
The authorities indicated that they are committed to continue improving the
AML/CFT legislation. They argued that an Intensified Anti-Economic Crime law had been
in place for the past few years, that the CBI’s AML/CFT regulations had been effectively
addressing both money laundering and financing of terrorism activities, and that the passage
of the new AML law had further strengthened the AML/CFT enforcement framework. The
authorities noted that the concerns of international observers about the effectiveness of the
AML/CFT legislation would be allayed through the implementation of the bylaws. To that
end, they indicated that AML implementing regulations are being prepared, a Financial
Intelligence Unit will be set up, and work on implementing CFT regulations is advancing.
The authorities requested an IMF technical assistance (TA) mission to examine progress on
developing the AML/CFT framework and provide further recommendations.
Other structural issues
34.
The authorities intend to move forward with other structural reforms. The
divestment program targets the transfer to the nongovernment sector of 80 percent of the
government’s shares in state-owned enterprises in most economic sectors by 2010 through
cash and deferred payments. The authorities believe that the program will help improve the
efficiency of enterprises, thereby stimulating growth and employment creation. They also see
the divestment process as a means of promoting social justice by transferring shares to the
lowest two deciles of the population at a 50-percent discount. In addition, the government is
interested in cooperating with the World Bank on improving the business climate to facilitate
private sector development and employment creation. Regarding trade reform, as part of its
WTO accession efforts, the government has prepared a new customs act to align national
customs procedures with WTO practices. However, at this time, there are no immediate plans
to reduce import tariffs in highly protected sectors (including automobiles, furniture, and
pharmaceuticals), with the possible exception of food products.

24
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
Iran’s economic growth has been boosted by rising oil prices, the regional
economic boom, and a strong policy stimulus. Real GDP growth averaged more than
6 percent a year during 2005/06–2007/08. Notwithstanding the strong domestic demand
growth, external current account surpluses increased markedly and gross official reserves
more than doubled during this period.
36.
Policies aimed at stimulating domestic demand, however, are becoming less
effective in supporting growth and employment creation. The recent rise in inflation
suggests that the economy is overheated; and the persistence of high unemployment indicates
that expansionary policies only have a temporary positive effect on employment creation
against the background of uneven progress on structural reforms. Looking forward, it is
crucial to slow domestic demand growth in order to lower inflation while stepping up
structural reforms to increase the economy’s growth potential and employment creation.
37.
In the short term, a significant strengthening of the fiscal position is essential for
containing inflationary pressures. While the authorities’ intent to limit the increase in the
non-oil primary fiscal deficit is a step in the right direction, an additional 2–3 percentage
points of GDP in measures (e.g., a further reduction in energy subsidies) would be needed to
significantly reduce the fiscal stimulus and limit the liquidity impact of fiscal operations.
38.
There is an urgent need to tighten monetary policy by intensifying the use of
market-based instruments. The rates of return on central bank facilities and the regulated
banking rates of return should be raised promptly. These measures, followed by a gradual
loosening of controls on banking rates of return and credit allocation, would help reduce the
banks’ use of the overdraft facility more effectively than moral suasion. Also, the authorities
should reconsider the intended reduction in the stock of outstanding CBPPs, and use this
sterilization instrument more proactively, given the uncertainties regarding the effectiveness
of the nascent interbank market. It would also be important to develop a secondary market for
CBPPs and promote their use as collateral in interbank transactions.
39.
Greater exchange rate flexibility would help pursue a more proactive monetary
policy. Discontinuing the depreciation of the rial vis-à-vis the basket of currencies and
allowing for greater exchange rate flexibility would help curtail monetary growth and reduce
imported inflation. The exchange rate will most likely appreciate under a more flexible
exchange rate arrangement.
40.
Providing the CBI with operational independence and establishing low inflation
as its main objective would facilitate the implementation of monetary policy and help
anchor expectations. In this regard, the authorities are strongly encouraged to resume their
work on the draft of a new central bank law.

25
41.
Iran’s medium-term prospects could be improved significantly. Over time,
sustaining the economy’s growth momentum and enhancing employment creation through
subsidies and administrative measures would become increasingly difficult, even under
relatively optimistic oil price assumptions. The medium-term outlook would be significantly
more favorable with further gains in macroeconomic stabilization and a decisive effort to step
up structural reforms.
42.
While long-term fiscal sustainability is not a matter of concern, further mediumterm fiscal adjustment is justified by domestic and external considerations. Under the
baseline scenario, the fiscal position would remain sustainable from a longer-term
perspective, notwithstanding the projected emergence of a fiscal deficit by 2010/11.
Nevertheless, it would be advisable to maintain fiscal surpluses in the medium term to
support the disinflation process, reduce REER appreciation pressures, and strengthen the
economy’s resilience to a potential decline in oil prices in a context of limited access to
foreign financing.
43.
There is a need to mobilize political support for the adoption and vigorous
implementation of the envisaged fiscal reforms. The medium-term adjustment effort
should focus on phasing out energy subsidies, an area where the authorities have been doing
valuable preparatory work. A gradual increase in energy prices to their international
benchmark levels over a three-year period would mobilize substantial additional budget
revenues, even assuming conservative oil prices by the end of the reform horizon. Efforts
should also be intensified to strengthen non-oil revenue administration, in line with current
plans. Part of these additional oil and non-oil revenues could be channeled to targeted social
assistance and other productive spending, in line with the government’s developmental
objectives.
44.
Implementing a rolling medium-term fiscal framework would facilitate fiscal
policy implementation in the face of oil price volatility. Such a framework should (i) focus
on a medium-term path for the non-oil primary deficit consistent with the authorities’
inflation objective, developmental priorities, and targeted accumulation of precautionary OSF
foreign assets; (ii) contain contingency plans for addressing any persistent deviations from
the oil price forecasts and potential costs related to the vulnerabilities of the banking system;
and (iii) allocate all oil revenues to the OSF and limit the use of its resources to financing the
non-oil budget deficit. The authorities’ intent to make more information about OSF
operations available to the public is welcome.
45.
The deepening of financial intermediation would benefit from a further
strengthening of banks’ financial position and the elimination of administrative
controls. Recent efforts to improve banking system supervision, privatize two mid-sized
banks, and recapitalize state-owned banks are steps in the right direction. These steps should
be accompanied by a strengthening of the CBI’s capacity to enforce prudential regulations.

26
Furthermore, phasing out administrative controls on banks and giving them more freedom in
selecting their clients and reflecting risk factors in the pricing of their products would
strengthen the banking system, foster its growth, and reduce the need for additional
recapitalizations in the future. To this end, strong political support will be necessary for the
passage of new market-oriented commercial banking legislation and its effective
implementation.
46.
A prompt resolution of the remaining issues in the AML framework leading to
its effective implementation and the establishment of a CFT framework will promote
the integrity of Iran’s financial system and improve the prospects for a closer
integration of Iran into the global financial system. The authorities are encouraged to
address the AML law’s deficiencies and adopt implementing regulations, and to ensure that
the CFT framework meets international standards. In this regard, the staff welcomes the
authorities’ intention to continue their cooperation with international organizations on these
issues. To assist the authorities in this endeavor, a TA mission from the IMF Legal
Department is prepared to visit Tehran in the near future.
47.
Further real exchange rate appreciation pressures are unavoidable in the
medium term, and related competitiveness concerns would be best addressed by
(i) gearing the privatization program toward genuine private investors rather than quasipublic sector institutions; (ii) implementing a reduction in trade tariff and non-tariff barriers
given the still high level of import protection; and (iii) continuing the dialogue with the
World Bank on other reforms critical for growth and employment creation (e.g., the business
environment and the labor market).
48.
The staff encourages the authorities to take the necessary steps to eliminate the
exchange restriction related to certain investments under the foreign investment law.
49.
Data reporting to the Fund is broadly adequate for effective surveillance, but the
remaining weaknesses need to be addressed. Recent improvements in data dissemination
on the CBI website are welcome. However, there is a need to expand the coverage of the
central government operations, and to improve the timeliness of financial sector vulnerability
indicators.
50.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with the Islamic
Republic of Iran be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Exchange System

The exchange rate is determined in the interbank foreign exchange market. Effective
December 1, 2007, the exchange rate regime was reclassified from the category of a de facto
fixed peg to a composite to the category of a de facto crawling peg to a composite.
With effect from September 6, 2004, the Islamic Republic of Iran accepted the obligations
under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. Iran maintains

3
one exchange restriction and two multiple currency practices subject to Fund jurisdiction
under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3.
a.
The exchange restriction arises from limitations on the transferability of rial profits
from certain investments under the Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Act and
from limitations on other investment-related current international payments under this act.
b.

The multiple currency practices arise from:

Budget subsidies for foreign exchange purchases in connection with payments of certain
letters of credit opened prior to March 21, 2002 under the previous multiple exchange rate
system; and
Obligations of entities that had received allocations of foreign exchange at subsidized
“allocated rates” under the previous multiple exchange rate system to surrender unused
allocations to the Central Bank of Iran at the allocation rate.

The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on February 23, 2007.

Annex III. Islamic Republic of Iran: Statistical Issues
Data reporting to the Fund is broadly adequate for effective surveillance, but the remaining
weaknesses need to be addressed. The Central Bank of Iran (CBI) disseminates key statistical
aggregates in its quarterly Economic Trends, also available at <http://www.cbi.ir/e/>. Recent
improvements in data dissemination on the CBI website are welcome. However, there is a
need to expand the coverage of the central government operations, and to improve the
timeliness of financial sector vulnerability indicators. Since 2002, the Fund’s Statistics
Department has assisted the authorities in their efforts to subscribe to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS), which is still pending.
Real sector statistics
•

National accounts statistics are reasonably sound. Improvements have been made in
the coverage of the informal economy. However, there is scope for further progress,
especially in the coverage of small-scale industries and services. Also, the CBI and
the Statistical Council of Iran (SCI) have undertaken to review and unify their
respective GDP estimates.

•

Price statistics are sound and released in a timely manner. The official labor market
statistics are released by the SCI, and are based on the definitions recommended by
the International Labor Organization (ILO). The data are based on an urban and rural
population sample of about 100,000 households, and the threshold for considering a
person employed is two days a week. Labor market statistics, however, could benefit
from further improvement, particularly with regard to employment and wage data.

Government finance statistics
•

The data are compiled in accordance with the Government Finance Statistics Manual,
2001 (GFSM 2001) for the core central government operations. Starting in 2003/04,
the fiscal data include implicit energy subsidies.

•

Data on central government operations, including the budgetary central government,
the Oil Stabilization Fund (OSF), and the Social Security Organization (SSO) are
reported to the Fund. Consolidated data on the budgetary central government and
SSO, and some elements of the OSF operations are disseminated.

•

There is a need to expand the coverage of central government to include four pension
funds and five procurement and distribution centers.

•

The submission for the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook includes data for
general and local governments starting in 2006.

•

The existing cash-based government accounting system should be upgraded to enable
recording of expenditures at the pre-payment stage.

7
•

The discrepancy between fiscal and monetary data on deficit financing has often been
relatively large, partly due to foreign currency valuation problems. There is a need to
develop a comprehensive database on domestic public debt, with a breakdown by
domestic creditor.

•

The Bonyad-e-Mostazafan va Janbazan (BMJ, Foundation of the Oppressed and
Injured) could be considered a holding company and classified in the nonfinancial
public corporations sector.

Monetary statistics
•

Monthly monetary data are reported to STA on a regular basis for publication in IFS,
but timeliness has been lagging.

•

Compilation of monetary statistics diverges from international standards in the
application of the residency criterion and in sectorization and classification. The
authorities are undertaking improvements in each of these areas, in line with the
recommendations of two STA missions in 2001 and 2003.

•

The measure of broad money employed by the CBI does not include deposits of
public nonfinancial corporations, local governments, or foreign-currency deposits of
residents.

•

The authorities are yet to submit test data in the format of Standarized Report Forms
(SRFs) developed by STA for reporting monetary data in line with the methodology
of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual.

External sector data
•

The accounting system for foreign exchange receipts and payments of the CBI and
banks is being implemented in line with the methodological guidelines of the Fund’s
Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5). This will allow compilation of
balance of payments statistics on a quarterly basis. Annual balance of payments data
up to 2000 were reported to STA for publication in BOPSY and IFS.

•

Some data on the international investment position are compiled and reported to Fund
staff. These data include gross international reserves, commercial banks’ assets, OSF
assets, and debt liabilities. However, only data on public and publicly guaranteed debt
and net international reserves are disseminated. Moreover, the debt classifications do
not fully accord with the guidelines of the External Debt Guide. The data template on
international reserves and foreign currency liquidity is not compiled.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
the Islamic Republic of Iran
On July 14, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Islamic Republic of Iran.1
Background

Iran’s growth performance has been robust in recent years, benefiting from high oil
prices, regional growth, and a strong policy stimulus. Real GDP growth is estimated
to have increased from 6.2 percent in 2006/07 (Iranian fiscal year starts on
March 21) to 6.6 percent in 2007/08, with real non-oil GDP growth estimated at
7.3 percent, on account of buoyant domestic demand and increased government
support for the priority sectors. Real oil GDP is estimated to have increased by about
1 percent, as production capacity was constrained by insufficient investment.
Unemployment declined slightly to 9.8 percent in the year to December 2007.
The external position is estimated to have strengthened significantly in 2007/08. The
current account surplus rose to 10 percent of GDP in 2007/08, from 9.2 percent in
2006/07. Gross official reserves reached $82 billion (12 months of imports) and the
external debt is estimated to have declined to 9 percent of GDP by end-March 2008.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2

Inflation rose to 24.2 percent in April 2008, from 16.8 percent in April 2007. A
significant increase in inflation excluding food and energy suggests strong
underlying domestic demand pressures. Higher import prices constituted an
additional cost-push factor.
While the fiscal stimulus was reduced somewhat in 2007/08, the budget continued to
provide impetus to domestic demand growth. The non-oil primary fiscal deficit
declined to 17 percent of GDP in 2007/08 from 21 percent in 2006/07, on account of
the rationing of subsidized gasoline, a reduction in nonwage current outlays, slower
growth of capital expenditure, and lower OSF lending. However, budgetary
expenditure increased by almost 15 percent in 2007/08 in addition to a cumulative
rise of more than 40 percent during 2005/06–2006/07.
Broad money growth remained relatively high in 2007/08. Reduced banking rates of
return, pressures on commercial banks to expand credit, and unsterilized purchases
of foreign exchange by the Central Bank of Iran contributed to this outcome. While
the banking supervision legislation has been improved, some state-owned banks
were still undercapitalized as of end-March 2008. Moreover, the deepening of
financial intermediation has slowed down in response to negative banking rates of
return in real terms.
Progress in structural reforms has been mixed. The increase in energy subsidies
has been contained through the rationing of gasoline at increased prices, the VAT is
close to implementation, and tax administration has been modernized. Moreover,
following the 2006 reinterpretation of Article 44 of the Constitution, the divestment
process has gathered pace. However, given the lack of large private investors, many
government-owned entities have been acquired through non-cash or deferred
settlements by quasi-public sector institutions. Furthermore, remaining weaknesses
in the business environment hinder private sector development and employment
creation.
The growth and external prospects for 2008/09 are good, but on current policies
inflation is expected to remain high. Real GDP growth is projected at 5.7 percent in
2008/09. Notwithstanding buoyant domestic demand, the external current account
surplus would remain broadly unchanged at 9–10 percent of GDP, as oil prices are
assumed to remain well above their 2007/08 level. The non-oil primary fiscal deficit
is projected to increase to 18.5 percent of GDP in 2008/09, from 17 percent in
2007/08. This, together with the maintenance of the current monetary policy stance,
will most likely cause inflation to remain at about 25 percent in the near term.

3

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Iran’s continued strong growth performance,
particularly in the non-oil sector. The country’s external position had strengthened
further, reflecting the impact of higher oil prices. They noted, however, that inflation
is rising, largely due to the expansionary policy stance and also, in part, to higher
import prices. Looking forward, Directors encouraged the authorities to act promptly
to prevent inflationary expectations from becoming entrenched, against a
background of a generally favorable short-term growth outlook.
Directors viewed that strengthening the fiscal position in 2008/09 will help to ease
demand pressures and limit the liquidity impact of fiscal operations. They welcomed
the authorities’ intention to contain expenditure below the budget level, and
observed that there is room for additional fiscal measures, particularly in the area of
energy subsidies.
Directors emphasized that, in the medium-term, further fiscal consolidation will be
needed to reduce inflationary pressures, prevent an erosion of external
competitiveness, and reduce the economy’s vulnerability to a possible decline in oil
prices. They agreed that adopting a rolling medium-term fiscal framework and
focusing the operations of the Oil Stabilization Fund (OSF) on its stabilization
objective would facilitate fiscal management in the face of oil price volatility.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ plans for far-reaching fiscal reforms and looked
forward to their steadfast implementation. In particular, they supported the intention
to replace the current subsidy program by targeted cash transfers to the poor.
Directors encouraged the authorities to move ahead with measures to improve tax
administration and streamline budgetary personnel expenditure.
Directors emphasized that the recent rise in inflation calls for monetary policy to be
tightened. They expressed doubt about the effectiveness of moral suasion and
interbank market operations in mopping up excess liquidity to slow money growth.
They encouraged a significant increase in banking rates of return as a more effective
way to tighten monetary conditions and support financial intermediation. Directors
generally recommended increased reliance on market-based instruments in
monetary operations. Most Directors were also of the view that greater exchange
rate flexibility would enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy.
Directors observed that strengthening the operational independence of the central
bank and establishing low inflation as its main objective will increase the
effectiveness of monetary policy and anchor inflationary expectations. They looked
forward to the resumption of work on a new central bank law.

4

Directors noted the importance of a strengthened and deregulated banking system,
welcomed recent steps to improve banking supervision and the authorities’ plans to
recapitalize state-owned banks. These measures would be enhanced by
accompanying improvements in the central bank’s capacity to enforce prudential
norms and a gradual deregulation of banking rates of return and credit allocation.
Directors looked forward to the prompt completion of ongoing work in the area of
anti-money laundering legislation through the adoption of appropriate implementing
regulations, and noted the authorities’ commitment to establishing an appropriate
framework for combating financing of terrorism. They welcomed the authorities’
intention to continue cooperating with international financial institutions on these
issues.
Directors noted that achieving the authorities’ objectives of improving
competitiveness and boosting economic growth and employment creation would
require an intensification of structural reforms aimed at stimulating private sector
development. In particular, they underscored the need to gear the divestment
process to private investors and improve the business climate in close cooperation
with the World Bank.
Directors also encouraged the authorities to take the necessary steps to eliminate
the exchange restriction related to certain investments under the foreign investment
law.
Directors welcomed the recent improvements in data dissemination and the
authorities’ intention to provide more information on Oil Stabilization Fund operations
to the public. They observed that further efforts were needed to broaden the
coverage of the central government operations and the timeliness of financial sector
vulnerability indicators.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's

Statement by Jafar Mojarrad, Executive Director for the Islamic Republic of Iran
July 14, 2008
1.
My authorities are thankful to the staff for the constructive policy discussions and the
high-quality reports, which provide useful insights into their policy challenges. As in the past,
the economic debate in Iran will continue to benefit from the IMF analysis and policy advice,
most notably the views expressed by Executive Directors.
2.
The authorities have continued to pursue their economic and social objectives under
the Fourth Five-Year Development Plan (FFYDP, 2004-09), now in the final stage of
implementation, and the 20-Year Vision Plan. The policy agenda has remained focused on
growth and employment, development of the non-oil sector, encouragement of the private
sector, and equitable distribution of resources in order to reduce regional and social
disparities. These objectives have been pursued with determination in an environment that
could be characterized as mixed. On the one hand, high oil export prices have provided the
necessary resources for financing investment in infrastructure and expanding production
capacity while maintaining an adequate level of social protection for the needy; on the other,
intensified international pressures and new sanctions have hindered foreign participation in
the oil sector, raised the cost of doing business with Iran, weakened the smooth functioning
of international banking payments and clearance, and complicated the task of macroeconomic
management.
Developments in 2007/08
3.
In 2007/08, growth was high and broad-based, and unemployment declined despite
the rapid growth of the labor force. Real GDP is estimated to have expanded by 6.6 percent,
supported by sustained domestic demand growth. The non-oil sector grew by 7.3 percent,
continuing a streak of high output growth since 2005/06, driven by strong performance in the
manufacturing and service sectors. The oil sector, however, recorded a moderate growth due
to insufficient foreign investment. The external position strengthened further in 2007/08, with
the current account surplus reaching an all-time high of 10 percent of GDP on the account of
increased oil exports and good performance of non-oil exports, the latter mainly reflecting
improved competitiveness. Gross official reserves, including those of the Oil Stabilization
Fund, rose to the equivalent of 12 months of imports.
4.
While these developments attest to the resilience of the economy, the rise of inflation
is a source of concern. My authorities believe that inflationary pressures have been driven by
a combination of factors, including strong domestic demand growth, high import prices, and
international pressures and sanctions. Efforts were made in 2007/08 to rebalance
macroeconomic policies toward containing inflation, but these have proved insufficient to
achieve the desired objective and would need to be strengthened in the period ahead.

2

5.
Fiscal policy was tightened in 2007/08. The non-oil primary deficit declined by about
4 percentage points of GDP, compared to 2006/07, and the non-oil deficit as a ratio of non-oil
GDP declined by about 5 percent. The brunt of the fiscal consolidation fell on capital
expenditure, which was reduced in real terms by 14 percent.
6.
The fiscal adjustment provided room for monetary policy tightening to reign in
inflation. The authorities increased the amount of open market operations on CBPPs to
absorb liquidity, but this proved insufficient to offset redemptions, given the negative real
rates of return. However, the effectiveness of monetary policy was constrained by several
factors, including the government-mandated reduction in banks’ rates of return to stimulate
private sector activity, liquidity injection by the OSF, and unsterilized net purchases of
foreign exchange by the Central Bank of Iran (CBI). Although in 2007/08 the growth of
broad money (M3) was reduced compared to the previous year, narrow money (M1) grew by
about 30 percent (or about the same rate as in 2006/07), and inflation started to move up.

The exchange regime has continued to operate smoothly, and confidence in the rial
has remained intact. The authorities have allowed for some depreciation in the nominal rate
to compensate for the inflation differential vis-à-vis Iran’s trading partners and protect the
competitiveness of the non-oil sector. This policy, however, may conflict with the disinflation
objective and will be reviewed in light of the findings of a comprehensive study on the
benefits and costs of allowing the rial to appreciate in nominal terms. The authorities are of
the view that Iran’s exchange rate regime is a managed float with respect to a basket of
currencies, since they do not target any particular rate. They remain open to further discussion
of this issue with staff. With regard to the exchange restrictions in connection with the
transferability of rial profits from certain investments under the foreign investment law, the
Ministry of Finance, after consultation with the IMF Legal Department (LEG), has sent the
draft amendments, which had been revised based on the IMF comments, to the cabinet for
approval.
8.
In the financial sector, domestic banks performed relatively well, even though the
international sanctions affected their relations with foreign partners. The private banks
continued to expand and have increased their market share to about 20 percent. In addition,
three state-owned banks were recapitalized and there are plans to privatize five mid-sized
state-owned banks. Regulations were set to allow foreign banks, or their branches, to be
established in the mainland. In this regard, the first branch of a European bank was recently
inaugurated in Tehran. The interbank market became recently operational, and the authorities
have requested technical assistance to enhance its operation. In addition, the CBI approved
new regulations on asset classification, provisioning, and banks’ investment, and has issued
new guidelines on liquidity management, internal controls, and corporate governance.
Moreover, bank supervision was strengthened significantly to bring it close to international
standards. Recent developments in the Iranian stock market are also promising, and stock
exchange indices have been on an upward trend since April 2008.

The passage of the AML law, which became effective in January 2008, further
strengthened the AML/CFT enforcement framework, and the by-laws and implementing
regulations are under preparation based on Fund TA recommendations. The authorities look
forward to receiving an IMF technical assistance mission to examine progress in developing
the AML/CFT framework and to provide further recommendations.
10.
Progress has been made in key structural reforms aimed at raising growth potential
and enhancing the role of the private sector. In this regard, privatization has shown
momentum, with private investors purchasing shares during the last two months to the tune
of 2 billion Euros in companies operating in steel, shipping, copper, and petrochemicals.
Preparatory work of a comprehensive subsidy reform also progressed. In the meantime, in
order to reduce the budget cost of subsidies on imported fuel products, rationing of gasoline
was introduced, which, consequently, has helped reduce consumption and imports. Fiscal
reform focused on revenue mobilization, including upgrading tax collection agencies with
new IT and accelerating the implementation of the VAT.
Policies in 2008/09
11.
Continued international pressures will impede expansion of oil production capacity,
while the drought will affect agricultural output and possibly weigh down on growth in the
non-oil sector. Against this background, macroeconomic policies will be geared toward
reducing inflation, while the pace of structural reforms will be accelerated to support growth
and employment and achieve the FFYDP’s targets. In the fiscal area, efforts will focus on
mobilization of non-oil revenue to offset the temporary revenue loss that could result from
the switch from the sales tax to the VAT. Based on a recent government circular to line
ministries, capital expenditure will be reduced by 30 percent, while current spending,
excluding on lending by OSF, will be slightly above the previous year’s level as a ratio of
GDP. As a result, my authorities expect the fiscal outcome to be stronger than envisaged
under the approved 2008/09 budget. They also stand ready to make further expenditure cuts
in the course of the fiscal year, if necessary.
12.
The CBI and the government’s Supreme Council for Economic Management and
Planning are working closely to formulate comprehensive policy recommendations to reduce
inflation. In the meantime, the CBI will seek to maintain the rates of return at their current
level, and will use moral suasion to contain the rapid credit growth. Also, the CBI will
continue to tighten its lending to banks through the overdraft facility to mop up excess
liquidity. In parallel and in light of the findings of the study mentioned above, exchange rate
policy will be made more consistent with the need to achieve disinflation.
13.
In the financial sector, the authorities plan to inject the equivalent of about $10 billion
of additional capital into the remaining under-capitalized state-owned banks by converting
OSF deposits into equity. To encourage private sector participation in the financial sector, the
government will divest its equity holding in two mid-sized banks.

Medium-term reforms
14.
The authorities’ medium-term strategy involves important, but challenging reforms
that could have far-reaching positive effects on the economy, the most important of which is
the reform of the subsidy system, together with the establishment of a more efficient and
better-targeted social safety net. In its well-crafted SIP, staff highlight in detail the high cost
and inefficiency of the current subsidy system and its harmful effects on the economy and the
environment. By and large, the authorities agree with these conclusions, and are working on a
comprehensive package of reforms to be implemented in the second half of the current
Iranian year. The main objective is to replace the present subsidy system with cash transfers
to households, to be modulated by income category based on a census on households’
economic situation.
15.
The pace of privatization will be accelerated. Following the reinterpretation of
Article 44 of the Constitution, about 80 percent of state-owned enterprises in the various
economic sectors, including oil and gas, petrochemicals, banks and insurances, and
telecommunications will be privatized by 2010. To facilitate the process, the authorities
intend to clarify the legal framework for the transfer of shares to the beneficiaries, provide
assistance to the public enterprises that will offer their shares on the Tehran Stock Exchange,
and restructure the companies that do not meet the requirements for divestiture. The
authorities look forward to cooperating with the World Bank to improve the financial
operations and management of public enterprises and enhance private sector participation in
the economy.
16.
In the fiscal area, plans are underway to streamline the public administration to reduce
the wage bill and broaden the tax base through revenue administration measures. The
authorities are also considering moving from the current system of five-year fiscal planning
to a rolling medium-term fiscal framework.
Other issues
17.
My authorities attach high value to their participation in the multilateral cooperation
system. In particular, despite the fact that Iranian law criminalizing money laundering and the
financing of terrorism has been in place since 1986, the authorities worked diligently to
obtain parliament approval of the AML bill, which became effective in January 2008. Soon
thereafter, they moved to accelerate the preparation of the by-laws and implementing
regulations, which are key to enhancing the AML/CFT framework. As explained last year,
under Iran’s legal system, laws are drafted in a summary form, leaving the technical and
procedural details to be clarified in by-laws and implementing regulations. The authorities
look forward to discussing these issues with the forthcoming IMF AML/CFT mission and to
benefit from its recommendations. Also, in the same spirit, the authorities have applied for
Iran’s membership in the FATF, and have asked that their application be placed on the fast

5

track agenda. Moreover, they have actively participated in the international community’s
efforts to support the reconstruction of Afghanistan and its economic developments.
18.
With regard to the recent decision by the governments of a few EU countries to freeze
the assets of Bank Melli’s subsidiary and branches in their respective jurisdictions, my
authorities believe that this decision is politically motivated and is not justified on regulatory
grounds. This subsidiary and branches have never been found in violation of the regulations
of the host countries.
19.
More generally, my authorities believe that the international payments system should
be insulated from the vagaries of political differences among member countries. Political
disputes between countries come and go, but the casualty should not be the credibility and
integrity of the international payments system. The IMF, as the guardian of this system, has a
role to play in this regard, and my authorities have full confidence in its capacity to do so.
