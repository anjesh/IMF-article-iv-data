IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Seychelles
On June 17, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Seychelles.
Macroeconomic outcomes remain solid, and most of the external pressures experienced in 2014
have abated. Weakness in the main exports combined with strong domestic demand in 2014 led to
depreciation pressures on the exchange rate. Beginning in late 2014, tighter monetary policy, a
recovery in tourism, and falling global fuel prices, together with the effects of the depreciation on
imports, helped to contain the external pressures. The combination of spending discipline and
buoyant fiscal revenues—driven by strong imports—resulted in a primary surplus of over 4½
percent of GDP in 2014, exceeding the target. However, disappointing tourism arrivals ensured that
growth remained subdued in 2014. Financial sector soundness indicators remain in the comfortable
range; the Central Bank of Seychelles had to take management control of a small off-shore bank in
October 2014 after it lost its correspondent relationship, but there should be no significant
repercussions on Seychelles’ economy.
With a continuing recovery in tourism and the effect of lower fuel prices, projected growth for 2015
is slightly higher than earlier envisaged at 3½ percent; the exchange rate has recovered modestly
against the dollar. The depreciation began to pass through to inflation, reaching 4.0 percent in May
2015 (year-on-year). The large current account deficit in 2014 is expected to contract sharply in
2015, helped by monetary policy tightening and lower fuel prices. In addition to a decline in
FDI-related imports, import demand will be restrained by the depreciation, continued tight
monetary policy, and a tight public sector wage round.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and
discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the
staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2

2

Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They commended the authorities for
the strong implementation of their Fund supported economic program, notwithstanding a difficult
external environment. The growth outlook is favorable, but the economy remains vulnerable to
global developments while domestic risks are linked to state owned enterprises. Against this
background, Directors underscored the importance of continued sound policies and structural
reforms to strengthen macroeconomic and financial stability, build policy buffers, and foster
sustained and inclusive growth.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to reducing public debt below 50 percent of GDP
by 2018. They observed, however, that achieving this target while continuing to address critical
infrastructure needs will require improving revenue mobilization and spending efficiency in the
context of a sound medium term budget framework.
Directors considered that the authorities’ tight monetary stance has been appropriate in light of the
recent external pressures and the rapid credit growth. Noting the risks to financial and
macroeconomic stability that continued credit expansion would entail, Directors welcomed the
authorities’ commitment to develop macro prudential tools and stressed the need for a determined
implementation of reforms in this area.
Directors welcomed plans to develop a more forward looking monetary policy framework, based on
liquidity and inflation forecasting and a strong coordination with the fiscal authorities. Directors
encouraged the authorities to further strengthen international reserves while maintaining
appropriate exchange rate flexibility, which has served the economy well.
Directors noted that the fragile financial situation of some state owned enterprises represents a
significant fiscal risk. Accordingly, they encouraged the authorities to push ahead with their strategy
to strengthen governance and performance of public enterprises. Directors also stressed that any
new expansions of state owned enterprise operations or mandates should be carefully vetted and
based on a strong and clear rationale for public sector involvement.
Directors agreed that further reforms are necessary to promote a dynamic private sector. They
supported measures to further improve the business and investment climate, including by opening
up key sectors so far protected from competition. Addressing skills mismatches in the labor market
remains an important policy priority.
Directors welcomed Seychelles’ subscription to the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard and
its recent accession to the World Trade Organization.

IMF Executive Board Completes Second Review Under the EFF with Seychelles and Approves
US$2.3 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed today the second review of
the arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) with Seychelles. The completion of the
review enables the disbursement of an amount equivalent to SDR 1.635 million (about US$2.3 million) bringing the total disbursements to SDR 4.905 million (about US$6.9 million).
In completing the review, the Executive Board also approved the authorities’ request for waiver and
modification of performance criteria. The 36-month, SDR 11.445 million arrangement under the EFF
(about US$16.1 million, the equivalent of 105 percent of Seychelles’ quota) was approved by the
Executive Board in June 2014 (see Press Release No. 14/262.).
Following the Executive Board's discussion, Mr. Min Zhu, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair
issued the following statement:
“Sound macroeconomic management has strengthened the Seychelles’ economy significantly. The
near-term growth outlook is favorable and prospects in the tourism sector remain strong, with
noticeable gains in both traditional and non-traditional markets.
“Policies have aimed at reinforcing resilience and entrenching macroeconomic stability. The
authorities remain on track to achieve their objective of reducing the debt burden below 50 percent
of GDP by 2018. Balancing this objective with the need to address critical infrastructure needs will
require tight control of current expenditure and improved governance and financial performance of
state-owned enterprises. Further progress in building international reserves has ensured an effective
buffer against external pressures.
“The authorities should continue to improve the forward-looking elements of their monetary policy
framework, including inflation forecasting and liquidity management. The exchange rate should
continue to be allowed to adjust freely to changes in the economic external and internal conditions.
“To support sustained and inclusive growth, structural reforms should aim to increase the role for the
private sector in the economy and enhance competition. In this regard, caution should be exercised
in expanding the roles and mandates of public enterprises. Accession to the World Trade
Organization is welcome, while further improvements in the business climate should aim to make
growth more inclusive by broadening access to credit, enhancing infrastructure, and reducing skills
mismatches in the labor market.”

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION,
SECOND REVIEW UNDER THE EXTENDED ARRANGEMENT, AND
REQUEST FOR WAIVER AND MODIFICATION OF PERFORMANCE
CRITERIA

KEY ISSUES
Context: The robust recovery from the 2008 balance of payments and debt crisis has resulted
in improved economic and social outcomes. Continued policy discipline and reforms are
needed for the microstate to mitigate its geographical and population constraints and
maintain momentum in developing a diversified and resilient economy.
Focus: With the fiscal stance anchored by the authorities’ debt reduction objective,
macroeconomic discussions concentrated on the smooth functioning of monetary and
exchange rate policies. On the structural agenda, the dialogue focused on policies to promote
sustained and inclusive growth, particularly on the appropriate role for state-owned enterprises
(SOEs).
Review: The program is on track. The authorities met the end-December quantitative
performance criteria except for narrowly exceeding the ceiling on reserve money. The structural
agenda remains broadly on track despite some delays. Staff recommends completion of the
second review under the Extended Arrangement and modification of the performance criteria
for end-June and end-December 2015, and supports the authorities’ request for a waiver for
the end-December 2014 performance criterion for reserve money.
Outlook and risks: With the external position having stabilized since the last review,
fundamentals are strengthening. However, the economy remains highly vulnerable to global
developments, including weakness in the key European markets, while domestic risks center on
the role of the SOEs.
Recommendations: The authorities’ objective of reducing public debt below 50 percent of
GDP by 2018 remains an appropriate and attainable anchor for fiscal policy. The monetary
policy framework should be further enhanced by increasing its forward orientation in the context of
a flexible exchange rate. Structural measures should focus on fostering inclusiveness and private

sector-led growth, while improving economic governance and the focus of SOEs.
Data: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. Priority areas include improved GDP
statistics, strengthening external sector statistics, and extending coverage of the international
investment position.

CONTEXT: MICROSTATE RECOVERING FROM CRISIS
Seychelles is an upper middle-income country—the smallest in sub-Saharan Africa—
successfully rebuilding resilience following a debt crisis in 2008-09.1 Per capita income has risen
over time, bringing it close to the World Bank threshold for high income status. However, income
inequality also appears to be high (as measured by the Gini coefficient).2 At the same time, absolute
poverty appears to be low,3 and most economic and social indicators compare well to other
microstates and advanced small island economies. In the aftermath of the 2008 balance of payments
and debt crisis, the authorities enacted an extensive set of reforms that quickly restored fiscal and
monetary credibility, with external support and Paris Club debt restructuring, and reduced the role of
the state in the economy. Historically, growth has been driven largely by capital accumulation, with
significant productivity gains evident primarily since 2008, when the reforms began (Annex 6).

Presidential elections are due by May 2016. Elections have been freely contested since the
1990s, although the ruling party candidate for president has won each election. In February 2015,
President Michel announced his candidacy for re-election to a third and final term. Despite a cabinet
reshuffle in January, the authorities have stressed continuity in economic policy, particularly the
commitment to macroeconomic stability and the EFF-supported program.
2.

The authorities’ policies have largely aligned with advice from previous Article IV
consultations. Fiscal policy has been appropriately tight to support continued reduction of the
public debt, monetary and exchange rate policies have allowed for an increase in the build-up of
foreign reserves, and Fund advice on mopping up the structural excess liquidity in the banking
system has been followed, supporting an evolving and more forward-looking monetary policy
framework. Structural reforms have also been implemented to improve the management of the
public enterprises, including the introduction of a Public Enterprise Monitoring Commission (PEMC).

Seychelles is a micro-state (i.e., population less than 200,000). While the overall area is 455 km , the population and
2
economic activity are concentrated on three mostly mountainous islands totaling 203 km , comparable to the size of
2
Washington, DC (177 km ).
2

The 2006/7 household survey measured the Gini of income inequality at 65.8 percent: while the results from the
2013 household survey are still being analyzed, they are also expected to yield a relatively high level.
3

Only 0.25 percent of the population was living on $1.25 or less a day in 2007. This measure may not be well adapted
to Seychelles and the World Bank is assisting the authorities in estimating a poverty line using the 2013 household
survey.

However, further progress is needed in implementation of the Public Financial Management Act,
particularly ensuring that all public enterprises submit audited accounts by end-March of the
following year.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK AND SPILLOVERS
Background and macroeconomic outlook. Macroeconomic outcomes remain solid, with
signs that most of the external pressures experienced in 2014 have abated. Output growth was
subdued in 2014, reflecting weakness in the main exports, tourism and canned tuna. Weak exports
combined with strong domestic demand4 led to depreciation pressures on the exchange rate, which
resulted in a 16 percent drop against the dollar from August through October 2014. Beginning in late
2014, tighter monetary policy, a recovery in tourism, and falling global fuel prices, together with the
effects of the depreciation on imports, helped to contain the external pressures and stabilize the
exchange rate. The combination of spending discipline and buoyant fiscal revenues—driven by
strong imports—resulted in a primary surplus of over 4½ percent of GDP in 2014, exceeding the
target, albeit with lower infrastructure investment than had been planned. The depreciation began to
pass through to inflation in 2015, with year-on-year inflation reaching 5.8 percent in March.5 In early
2015, the exchange rate began to recover modestly against the dollar (bringing depreciation from
July 2014 through April 2015 down to 9 percent). With a continuing recovery in tourism and the
effect of lower fuel prices, projected growth for 2015 is slightly higher than earlier envisaged at
3½ percent.
4.

Financial sector soundness indicators remain in the comfortable range; the Central Bank
of Seychelles (CBS) intervened in a small off-shore bank in November 2014, with no significant
repercussions on the domestic economy (Table 5 and Annex 7). Financial soundness indicators for
the domestic banking system continue to be solid despite the recent rapid rise in private sector
credit, with capital adequacy ratios substantially above the regulatory minimum, strong profitability
indicators, and a roughly stable non-performing loan ratio. In the wake of worldwide de-risking
associated with the increased attention given to AML/CFT obligations, Bank of Muscat International
Offshore (BMIO) – a joint venture between a government owned Seychelles bank (Nouvobanq) and a
Bahrain based subsidiary of Bank Muscat – lost its correspondent relationship, and the CBS took
management control. As an offshore bank with funds primarily invested in liquid securities, there
were no significant linkages with or repercussions on the economy in Seychelles. The CBS continues
to manage the institution, pending a reorganization plan to be approved by its shareholders.6
5.

The large current account deficit in 2014 is expected to contract sharply in 2015, helped
by monetary policy tightening and an improvement in the terms of trade. Weak export
revenues combined with strong imports pushed the current account deficit to 21.0 percent of GDP in
6.

4

The domestic demand pressures that led to the sharp rise in imports were fueled both by a 13 percent (year-onyear) rise in personal earnings economy-wide, associated with a large public sector wage increase, and a 26 percent
expansion in private sector credit. The demand pressures came despite the continuation of a generally tight fiscal
stance.
5

Historical pass-through data suggest a pass-through of 65 percent over 18 months.

6

The CBS has found a new correspondent relationship and has commissioned KPMG Mauritius to formulate a
reorganization plan, including strengthening its internal controls. MCM has offered advice on the process.

2014. In 2015, the current account deficit is projected to shrink nearly 6 percentage points of GDP,
thanks to lower world commodity prices (especially for fuel),7 lower import demand, and a recovery
in export volumes. In addition to a decline in FDI-related imports, import demand will be restrained
by the lagged effects of the 2014 depreciation, continued tight monetary policy (which is expected to
gradually contain private sector credit growth), and a public sector wage freeze.8 Rising volumes for
tourism and canned tuna are expected to partially offset falling prices in dollar terms. A recovery in
European tourism and continued growth from emerging markets (EMs) will likely boost tourist
arrivals, although downside risks are considerable (see below). However, tourism and tuna export
revenues in dollar terms are suffering from significant downward price pressures, offsetting the
measured improvement in the terms of trade.9 Beyond 2015, macroeconomic stability and resilience
are expected to strengthen as policies further anchor expectations and build buffers.
Spillovers. As a small, extremely open, tourism-dependent economy, Seychelles remains
highly sensitive to inward spillovers. The most important ones are falling fuel prices, the
appreciation of the US dollar against the euro, and weak growth in Europe and certain EMs. Lower
fuel prices have lessened pressures on the balance of payments. No major fiscal impact is expected
from lower fuel prices, however, since consumer prices adjust automatically and fuel taxes are
specific rather than ad valorem. With over a third of the public debt stock in Euros and SDR, the
balance sheet impact of the change in dollar/Euro cross-rate is partially mitigated. On the other
hand, the margins in the tourism sector are coming under pressure from the fall in the Euro relative
to the dollar—most hotels sell their rooms through international tourism operators, fixing prices in
Euros for the year ahead, while the bulk of costs for the hotels are in US dollars and Seychellois
Rupees. Tourism arrivals are closely linked to economic performance in Europe and increasingly
certain EMs (Annex 3).
7.

Risks. As an extremely open economy, Seychelles faces an inherently high vulnerability
to external shocks, as well as domestic risks, stemming for example from policy slippages or
the SOE sector. The successful management of the external pressures last year demonstrated the
authorities’ commitment to the flexibility built into the program, as well as some resilience in the
economy. However, the external environment continues to pose multiple risks (see Risk Assessment
Matrix (RAM), Box 1); tourism revenues are vulnerable to numerous developments, including a weak
recovery in the Euro zone and geopolitical risks in the Middle East and Russia; the latter risks could
add to balance of payments pressures through their knock-on effects on fuel prices. Moreover,
experience has shown that domestic policy loosening can quickly destabilize Seychelles’ open
economy. The large wage increases in 2014 and losses in SOEs in 2011-2012 translated quickly into
8.

7

Seychelles has not benefitted fully from the fall in world fuel prices; since it buys in small quantities and has a longterm supply contract, its purchase prices have not fallen as much as world market prices.
8

While there is a slight fiscal easing expected in 2015, the public sector wage freeze will have a more significant
impact on the current account, given its impact on private sector earnings and consequently on credit (for example
through debt to income ratios).
9

Tourism prices are not included in the terms of trade measure. The CBS, with the support of the IMF’s Statistics
Department (STA), has implemented a new methodology to estimate tourism earnings, based on tourism-related
transactions reported by authorized foreign exchange dealers. Under this methodology, tourism earnings have been
revised up by a significant amount, which contributes to the current account improvement.

GOOD PERFORMANCE UNDER THE EFF
The program is broadly on track, bolstering sustainability and resilience. The fiscal balance
benefited from revenue overperformance driven by the strong import demand. Spending levels were
roughly as anticipated, though with some decline in quality, as unexpected support of $8.5 million to
Air Seychelles11 was offset by reduced lending to the Public Utilities Corporation due to delays in
project implementation. The net result was the performance criterion (PC) on the fiscal primary
surplus was exceeded by ⅓ percent of GDP. After the rupee stabilized against the dollar in
November, the CBS was able to purchase nearly US$10 million and comfortably exceed the net
international reserves (NIR) PC. However, this purchase, equivalent to 6 percent of base money,
boosted liquidity. Following difficulties in policy coordination, operation of liquidity management
tools, and end-year liquidity forecasting,12 the PC on the ceiling for daily average reserve money was
breached by 0.4 percent. Nonetheless, inflation remained contained, well below program projections,
and reserve money was brought down below the program ceiling in January. Since the deviation
from the target was minor and temporary, staff support the authorities’ request for a waiver.
9.

Some program targets for 2015 are proposed to be strengthened. Considering the
improved external conditions, the previously conservative NIR targets for 2015 have been revised
upward to lock in last year’s overperformance and maintain stable reserve levels, despite downward
pressure due to the valuation effect.13 The average daily reserve money ceiling for the second quarter
has been lowered slightly to help rein in private sector credit growth. Other macroeconomic program
targets remain appropriate.
10.

Implementation of the structural agenda is generally proceeding as planned, despite
some delays (Tables 2a and 2b of Attachment 1, Appendix I). The authorities met the two endDecember 2014 structural benchmarks (SBs) on time, while they met the end-March 2015 and the
end-June 2014 SBs with a delay—a substantial one in the latter case. The National Assembly
amended the Seychelles Revenue Commission (SRC) Act to align the legislation with OECD
guidelines in December 2014 and ratified the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative
Assistance in Tax Matters in April 2015 (SB, end-June 2014)14 To maintain momentum in reforming
this sector, the authorities are proposing a new benchmark on submitting legislation to the National
Assembly on international corporate providers and trusts by end-December, which is being
developed in consultation with the OECD and other international partners. Measures aimed at
enhancing SOE oversight, including outside review of investment decisions (end-March 2015 SB),
11.

This amount had been agreed in the 2012 restructuring but it was not expected it would be needed in 2014 and
thus had not been incorporated into the 2014 budget.
12

In early November, the CBS and Treasury completed the agreed issuance of T-bills for monetary purposes. The
price-based deposit auctions proved insufficiently flexible to attract buyers in rapidly evolving conditions. T-bill
auctions for monetary purposes resumed in late December 2014 with the objective of bringing reserve money under
the ceiling but failed to attract enough interest, as banks preferred to hold liquidity for end-year contingencies.
13

Because the public sector foreign exchange cash flow is negative, the CBS must make significant purchases in the
market just to maintain stable NIR levels. The valuation effect reduces the dollar value of stable reserves in other
currencies, as the dollar appreciates.
14

These measures are considered macro-critical, because they are essential to the sustainability of the off-shore
global business services sector, which accounts for 4 percent of GDP.

SEYCHELLES

were adopted in early May; further efforts, including capacity building and rigorous evaluation of
new investments, are needed to contain the risks from the sector. It is proposed that the endOctober benchmark on a macroprudential framework be revised to accommodate the need for legal
changes. Other benchmarks have been met or are on track to be met.

MACROECONOMIC POLICY: BUTTRESSING STABILITY
Fiscal policy: Stay the course on debt reduction while improving the quality of spending
The 2015 budget target of a 3.7 percent of GDP primary surplus remains appropriate and
attainable. Spending plans maintain stable domestically-financed investment, relative to GDP,
thanks in part to restrained current spending. Revenues are projected to fall relative to GDP as the
overperformance in 2014 due to strong imports is not expected to be repeated; tax policy has
remained largely unchanged, apart from some increases in fees and excises. The depreciation of the
Euro also poses some risks to revenues as hotel yields come under pressure in rupee terms, though
this should be offset by the impact of some reduced Euro-denominated government spending.
12.

The authorities’ medium term goal of reducing public debt below 50 percent of GDP by
end-2018 provides a strong anchor for macroeconomic policy. Last year’s depreciation will
require a slight increase in the primary surplus path relative to the program request to preserve the
debt dynamics (Annex 1). Fiscal discipline is essential to further reduce vulnerabilities, as well as
supporting monetary and exchange rate policy in the context of a floating exchange rate in a small
open economy (one of the smallest in the world with a floating exchange rate).
13.

The tax system has been successfully overhauled since the crisis, and the tax take is high
relative to comparators (Text Figure 1). Overall, these reforms, most notably the introduction of a
VAT and a flat-rate personal income tax, succeeded in generating revenue with less distortions.
However, business tax collections have been disappointing, falling from 6.9 percent of GDP in 2009
to 4.2 percent last year: the

Staff noted that the progress made on the quality of expenditures in the immediate
post-crisis period has come under some pressure as a result of wage growth. Primary current
spending was 10 percent of GDP lower in 2013 than in the pre-crisis period. Government wages
reached their nadir relative to GDP in 2010, falling to 5.9 percent of GDP, less than half their pre-crisis
15.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 9

SEYCHELLES

level. Since then however, wages have risen again to 7 percent of GDP—or just under 9 percent if
wages of workers in government agencies are included.15 In the context of the debt reduction goal
and no major gains expected in revenues, staff highlighted that any further increase in the public
wage to GDP ratio risks crowding out investment spending or other current spending priorities, as
well as potentially weakening competitiveness.16
The authorities reiterated their commitment to the debt reduction goal. On revenues, they
noted the efforts they were making to audit large businesses, as well as recent initiatives introduced
to improve compliance and collect tax arrears. However, while they accepted the need for restraint
on current expenditures, they also noted that expenditure on public sector wages as a percent of
GDP remained relatively low in Seychelles compared to other small island states, and they stressed
that growth prospects depended importantly on investments in education. Staff agreed with the
need for a high quality and adequately staffed educational system but suggested further efficiencies
could be sought across public sector, for example by more efficient use of personnel or greater use
of technology.
16.

Monetary, financial and exchange rate policies: Further reinforce foundations for stability
Monetary policy should continue to remain tight to contain potential inflationary
pressures and strong private sector credit growth. By the third quarter of 2015, the pass-through
of exchange rate depreciation is expected to have largely dissipated, and private sector credit growth
should settle into a more sustainable pace (10-to-15 percent range). The CBS consequently decided
to tighten the reserve money targets for the second quarter. The tight monetary stance will also be
conducive for market conditions for foreign exchange purchases, although active sterilization policies
will be needed to avoid volatility in monetary conditions and interest rates.
17.

While the monetary policy framework has improved, staff and the authorities agreed
that further strengthening in liquidity management is warranted. The immediate problems
experienced in the last quarter of 2014 were corrected in the first quarter of 2015 through improved
coordination with the Treasury, which agreed to provide the amounts of T-bills deemed necessary by
the CBS for monetary sterilization, and quarterly average of daily reserve money moved back into the
target corridor. The CBS has also moved back to quantity-based deposit auctions. In the context of
an evolving monetary policy framework and a shallow financial sector, some initial difficulties are to
be expected, and the IMF’s Monetary and Capital Markets department (MCM) is providing ongoing
technical assistance (TA), particularly in liquidity management.

indicators remain strong; although the recent rapid private sector credit growth has reduced some
capital adequacy ratios, they remain well above minimum levels. Discussions did not reveal any
reports of weakening lending standards, some of the increase in private sector credit was a
revaluation of foreign exchange denominated debt,18 and private sector credit as a proportion of
GDP was only returning to previous levels (Text Figure 2). Nevertheless, given the pace of growth,
asset quality merits careful monitoring, especially if it does not moderate as planned. With TA from
MCM, the CBS is working to enhance its capacity to assess and monitor systemic risk, as well as to
develop appropriate capital-based, liquidity, and

banking supervision and bank resolution.
The flexible exchange rate facilitated Seychelles’s adjustment to a volatile external
environment in 2014 and 2015, but the small size of the market contributed to the occasional
emergence of backlogs in clearing transactions. As balance of payments pressures developed in
August 2014, backlogs materialized and then the Rupee began to depreciate. Small backlogs
occurred sporadically thereafter, especially when a large market player would decline to execute a
transaction – presumably out of fear of moving the rate more than desired or hoping for
interventions from the government or the CBS (there were no exchange restrictions causing the
backlogs). Market actors fear that the small size of the foreign exchange market, combined with a
shallow and concentrated financial system, can leave the market prone to large swings. Over time, as
it became clear that the authorities were unwilling to intervene to stop an orderly adjustment of
exchange rate to fundamentals, the backlog cleared and the exchange rate eventually stabilized.
Moreover, the exchange rate has demonstrated two-way flexibility, with the large depreciation in
August-October of 2014 followed by a partial recovery since then. The exchange rate now appears
broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals (Box 2 and Annex 4).
20.

Staff and the authorities agreed on the need to allow market forces to play their role in
equilibrating demand for foreign exchange. Throughout the depreciation episode, staff and the
authorities concurred on the need to intervene only in case of excess volatility. In addition, there was
agreement that reserves remain broadly adequate (given Seychelles’ vulnerabilities, the levels of
coverage exceeds adequacy according to standard metrics, Box 2 and Annex 4).19 There was also
21.

18

The valuation impact on nominal credit growth is estimated to have contributed 2 to 4½ percentage points of the
25 percent increase in nominal credit to the private sector (given that the data for domestic bank lending in foreign
currency are not broken down into their US dollar and Euro components, only a range estimate can be given).
19

The uptick in reserve import coverage in 2014 is due to a transitory fall in imports during 2015 that is expected to
unwind in future years, as oil prices rebound and the tight monetary policy stance is relaxed. Similarly, the temporary
dip in projected reserve coverage in 2016 reflects a transitory increase in imports in 2017 related to large FDI projects.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 11

SEYCHELLES

agreement on the need to continue gradual accumulation on an opportunistic basis (i.e., when
market conditions are propitious) over the medium-term to maintain coverage. Under the terms of
Seychelles’ public debt restructuring, external debt service will rise by 1½ percentage points of GDP
over the next two years. Making this debt service will require significant purchases in the market,
supported by macroeconomic discipline.
Box 2. External Stability Strengthening Despite Continuing Vulnerabilities
The immediate risks to external stability appear contained. The level of reserves exceeds all metrics for
adequacy by a comfortable margin, marking a steady improvement in comparison to the post-crisis years
(Annex 4). Reserves are sufficient to cover more than four months of imports and exceed the amount of
external public and private short-term debt. Nevertheless, continuing efforts to build the stock of external
reserves will be necessary over the medium term in order to preserve adequacy, in light of the intrinsic
vulnerabilities of the economy and expected increase in debt service payments.
Seychelles remains competitive in tourism, its main export. Its share in world tourism arrivals has been
growing gradually over time. Improving the business climate and continuing the marketing efforts to
promote Seychelles’ brand globally can sustain competitiveness and bring additional benefits to the tourism
sector and the economy.
The two-way flexibility in the exchange over the past year has proven helpful in adjusting to external shocks
while avoiding the need for excessive fiscal adjustments. While the exchange rate assessment pointed to
some potential overvaluation in

STRUCTURAL REFORMS: REDUCING RISKS AND
PROMOTING GROWTH
Generating sustained and inclusive growth in the Seychelles will require mitigating structural
disadvantages stemming from geography and size. In this context, discussions on the structural reform
agenda focused on three priority objectives: (i) sustaining inclusive growth; (ii) enhancing quality of
fiscal policy; and (iii) improved oversight and efficiency for SOEs (Tables 8 and 9 for Structural
Benchmarks).
Buttressing the foundations for sustained and inclusive growth
While social outcomes are favorable, inequality appears to be high. Spending on health,
education and social programs account for one-third of government expenditure, allowing for free
access to primary, secondary and most tertiary education, as well as to healthcare; as a result, literacy
rates are very high and rates of maternal and infant mortality very low. Yet despite very low
22.

12 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SEYCHELLES

unemployment levels (below 5 percent), income inequality is high.20 However, non-Seychellois
workers fill many skilled and professional jobs, suggesting a skills mismatch despite high literacy.
Progress in reducing inequality will require fundamental economic and educational reforms to
support broader-based economic growth over the medium term. In the meantime, it is important to
safeguard against measures that restrict non-Seychellois workers from providing services necessary
to ensure competitiveness.
To sustain growth and distribute its benefits more broadly, Seychelles needs to
strengthen the drivers for private sector-led growth. The recently adopted Medium-Term
National Development Strategy (MTNDS) identified the priorities for medium-term growth, including
most notably governance, the environment, and energy. The tourism sector has driven growth
historically, yet Seychelles’ small size and higher-end market niche limit the potential for expansion
through increasing the number and density of hotels. Medium-term structural reforms need to focus
on higher value-added tourism activities, more diversification of source markets, and broader,
competitive air transport connections, including direct links to Europe and China where profitable. To
help make growth more inclusive (Annex 6), the tourism sector could have more linkages to the local
economy, including for example promoting guesthouses and other tourist services provided by local
SMEs (Annex 5), and the generous tax incentives for investment in the industry should be reviewed.
23.

Sectoral diversification beyond tourism depends critically on improving the business
climate. Progress in this area is lagging—Seychelles’ ranking in the World Bank’s doing business
indicators was 85th (up only two places from 2014) (Text Figure 3). Businesses complain that they are
held back by the high cost of electricity, which results in part from cross-subsidies that the
government plans to reduce over the next 8-10 years. Staff encouraged the authorities to look for
ways to accelerate the reduction in cross-subsidies. In addition, staff stressed that successfully
expanding the global business services sector as planned will depend on strengthening the
governance of the sector, ensuring that it is brought into conformity with international norms. Some
large infrastructure projects, for example in the port, could boost growth sustainably, provided they
are carefully planned and financed; staff stressed that Public Private Partnerships need to minimize
risks to the public balance sheet. In the

establishing new businesses, such as financial literacy and red tape, rather than providing tax
incentives that could distort behavior and erode the revenue base.
The authorities agreed on the need to improve the business climate. A new Ministry of
Entrepreneurship Development and Business Innovation is considering measures to support new
enterprises, including working with other departments and the private sector to overcome hurdles to
establish new businesses, and refocusing the government’s SME loan guarantee scheme. The
authorities acknowledged that the price of electricity was an issue but highlighted the potential
distributional impact of speeding up the planned rebalancing. They also highlighted that in March
2015 Seychelles completed the WTO ratification process and has become its 161st member, which
should support policy stability and access to foreign markets. Concerning on Public Private
Partnerships (PPPs), the authorities were working with the African Development Bank and other
partners to formulate a policy, which would ensure transparency and accountability in taking any
risks on the public balance sheet.
25.

Improving access to finance is a key goal for robust and inclusive growth, motivating the
authorities’ Financial Sector Development Implementation Plan (FSDIP). Approved by cabinet
last year (SB, end-October 2014), the plan was developed with World Bank support. Its most
macroeconomically important elements are enhancing the legal and supervisory frameworks for
financial institutions (banks, nonbank financial institutions, offshore banks, and other offshore
financial services) and fostering capital market development. Other important elements of the FSDIP
include developing financial infrastructure, in particular the payments and credit information
systems, and improving access to credit for SMEs and households. Staff and the authorities agreed
on the need to maintain momentum in implementation. The authorities are in discussions with
partners, including the IMF, on accessing technical support for this effort.
26.

Staff and the authorities agreed that improving the quality of public finances and
spending will be vital in the context of continued debt reduction and expenditure restraint.
Public financial management reforms are advancing well (Annex 5); following the adoption of a
Medium-Term Fiscal Framework (SB, end-September 2014), the next step is to adopt a MediumTerm Budget Framework, which sets ministerial budgets in line with MTNDS’ priorities. The extension
of Program Performance Based Budgeting (PPBB) will promote more cost-effective spending and
medium-term planning. While a priority for reform and growth, public investment spending still
suffers from chronic under-execution of capital expenditure, despite the recent introduction of a
Public Sector Investment Plan.21 A new Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA)
assessment will provide an assessment of progress since the 2011 assessment and suggest areas for
improvement. Over the medium term, public spending will also have to adjust to face new
challenges. Healthcare, for example, will have to shift towards addressing diseases of affluence and
an ageing population, at the same time as education needs to refocus on the serious skills mismatch.
27.

Notwithstanding progress on SOE reform, further action is needed to contain fiscal risks,
ensure efficiency, and protect the role of private business. Although the PEMC regularly receives

data on SOEs’ financial performance, its role could be strengthened by enhancing its capacity to
analyze data and audit SOE governance (SB, end-June 2016).22 The authorities have approved plans
to strengthen oversight, including of new investment plans (SB, end-March 2015). However, fiscal
risks are rising as key SOEs expand their activities: Seychelles Trading Company (STC) is expanding
into a new larger retail outlet; Air Seychelles has added new destinations despite large operating
losses; and Seychelles Public Transport Corporation (SPTC) recorded a loss last year despite its
government subsidy.
Staff stressed that the role of the state holding company, Société Seychelloise
d’Investissement (SSI), should focus on government oversight and not the creation of new
sources of risk. The SSI was established to amalgamate commercial public enterprises in order to
provide more effective oversight. In addition, the authorities are considering a new investment
mandate for SSI proposed by its management, relying on dividends and leveraging its balance sheet.
Staff recommended that the mandate be limited to clear instances of market failure or public goods
in short supply, with careful vetting of proposed investments. Staff noted that unnecessary expansion
by SOEs into commercial ventures had led to major financial losses in the past and contended that
the private sector was better placed to engage in such activities. Continued improvements in the
governance of SSI are also important in the view of staff, particularly strengthening the
independence of its board from the management of its component companies.
29.

The authorities acknowledged the need for careful oversight of the SOE sector. They
pointed to the enhanced role of PEMC, and the progress made in establishing the division of labor
between the SSI and PEMC. In the case of Air Seychelles, they have worked with the management to
establish a clear plan to return the airline to profitability without budgetary support over three years,
including clear milestones by which progress could be assessed. They agreed that any public support
should be transparently budgeted, accommodated within the agreed medium-term fiscal balances,
and subject to review in the event that the milestones were not met. However, given Seychelles’
dependence on tourism, they saw a strategic need for a strong state-owned company in preventing
over-reliance on foreign carriers. In light of the country’s small size and the relatively-undeveloped
private sector, they also saw a need for government to play a large role in developing the economy,
overcoming weaknesses in competition and scale. However, the authorities agreed to work with the
World Bank and IMF in defining the SSI’s new mandate, which they stressed was not designed to
compete with the private sector.
30.

OTHER ISSUES
31.

In February 2015, the Paris Club agreed on an innovative proposal by the Seychellois

authorities for financing marine conservation through a debt buyback operation (Box 3). While
the operation does not reduce the country’s nominal obligations, debt service is re-profiled, reducing
a near-term hump, and foreign currency debt service is reduced, as a portion of estimated
$27 million of debt bought back from the Paris Club (out of total public external debt of
$512 million) will be replaced by local currency denominated obligations to the conservation project.

While all SOEs are required to submit audited accounts to the PEMC by end-March, only four have done so this
year, albeit an improvement on the one company that submitted on time last year.

Most significantly, debt service payments will go to marine conservation that protects Seychelles’ rich
fisheries and supports tourism.
Seychelles’ capacity to repay the Fund remains strong, as obligations remain small
relative to exports and reserves (Table 6). The adequate level of international reserves and the
authorities’ continued commitment to achieving their debt objective provide a strong anchor for
macro-stability, but the economy remains vulnerable to external shocks. In addition, the recent
follow up safeguards mission found that safeguards were broadly adequate, although the central
bank’s legal framework and audit functions need to be further strengthened in the course of
ongoing institutional development.

Box 3. Seychelles’ Debt Buyback for Conservation and Climate Adaptation
Seychelles has reached preliminary agreement with its Paris Club creditors (including South Africa as an ad hoc
participant) on an innovative debt operation which aims to ensure a continuing stream of resources to support
marine conservation while reducing its external debt burden. The operation involves a buyback of a portion of
Seychelles’ Paris Club debt (around $30 million is eligible) with financing from a marine conservation NGO. The
mechanics of the operation are as follows:
1. The Nature Conservancy, a global environmental NGO, funds a new trust in Seychelles (Seychelles
Conservation and Climate Adaptation Trust, or SCCAT) through its own resources and additional grants
raised from donors.
2. SCCAT lends the funds to the government, which then proceeds with the Paris Club buyback.
3. The government agrees to repay SCCAT at the face value of the claims over an extended period of time,
partly in local currency.
4. A marine conservation initiative is funded with these regular payments, with a fraction set aside to establish
an endowment dedicated to funding the project permanently.

The SCCAT is the final beneficiary of the negotiated discount on Seychelles’ debt and receives annual
flows, as well as a permanent endowment to support the environmental project. In this way, debt service is
re-directed to marine conservation.
The GoS extends its repayment period and partially converts the payment of the claims into rupees. It will
also benefit from the implementation of the marine conservation initiative.
The Paris Club obtains the immediate payment of a share of its claim, at a moderate discount.

Seychelles’ macroeconomic data are broadly adequate to conduct surveillance despite
some weaknesses. The authorities achieved compliance with SDDS on May 1, 2015. Further work is
underway to improve the compilation of external statistics and the international investment position
(IIP).
33.

STAFF APPRAISAL
The authorities continue to implement their macroeconomic program in the face of some
difficulties. Several years of fiscal discipline has led to a significant reduction in the public debt
burden. Fiscal and monetary authorities have cooperated to mop up substantial structural excess
liquidity, enabling monetary policy to play a growing role in managing demand and supporting
stability. The evolving monetary policy framework has understandably faced some difficulties, yet the
authorities have demonstrated their resolve and ability to manage successfully the pressures that led
to the depreciation in the second half of 2014; the sharp tightening of liquidity conditions was both
effective and appropriate. The accumulation and maintenance of an adequate level of reserves—an
important achievement in the face of volatile external conditions—can act as an effective bulwark
against shocks, boosting resilience.
34.

Nevertheless, as a very open economy, Seychelles remains vulnerable to external
developments despite the considerable progress made in recent years. The outlook for tourist
arrivals remains highly susceptible to external developments, such as the fitful recovery in the Euro
Area, weakness in the Euro, and geopolitical tensions disrupting the Middle Eastern travel hubs and
causing higher oil prices. The authorities in Seychelles are acutely aware of these vulnerabilities and
risks. In addition to actively developing multiple tourism markets to diversify, they are also rightly
focused on building macroeconomic buffers—in terms of robust debt dynamics and reserves—to
manage the impact of shocks. These vulnerabilities highlight the central importance of continued
macroeconomic discipline, sustained debt reduction, and preservation of adequate reserve coverage.
These policies, combined with exchange rate flexibility, have strengthened external stability recently,
and external risks appear contained. In particular, the exchange rate appears broadly in line with
fundamentals.
35.

The authorities should maintain the appropriately tight monetary policy stance until
inflation and private sector credit growth slows appreciably. The rapid growth of private sector
credit in 2014 weakened macroeconomic stability and was not sustainable. The authorities should
continue to make progress on the technical elements underpinning a forward-looking monetary
policy framework, including liquidity and inflation forecasting and strong policy coordination. While
the recent credit growth to date does not appear to have weakened financial sector soundness, it is
important to develop the macro-prudential tools to be able to safeguard the strength of the financial
sector if necessary. Further financial deepening remains desirable over the medium term, including
robust private sector credit growth that is consistent with macroeconomic and financial sector
stability. Improved guidance of market expectations through a stronger monetary policy framework
over the medium term will facilitate financial intermediation and access to credit, thereby supporting
growth in the private sector.
36.

The continued commitment to the debt reduction target provides a clear and
transparent anchor to the authorities’ fiscal strategy, as well as to policy more broadly. Lower

public debt is key to building the resilience of the economy. Similarly, close control over current
expenditure is necessary to ensure spending levels remain sustainable and leave sufficient room for
making investments in infrastructure, which are crucial to supporting growth. Improving the
execution and efficiency of planned investment spending is a high priority. In this context, further
progress on medium-term budget framework would provide a stronger basis for resource allocation
in what will continue to be a relatively tight fiscal environment.
Domestic risks center on the performance and role of the SOEs, where potential
mistakes could imperil the hard-won macroeconomic progress. Air Seychelles is developing a
plan to eliminate operating losses and budget support by the end of 2018, which will require a
substantial turnaround. The authorities should assess any failure to achieve the milestones in the
plan and consider prompt corrective action, including the option of rationalizing operations to
profitable routes. Similarly, the expansion plans of STC should be carefully vetted and monitored to
minimize risks. Being mindful of unprofitable public sector investments in commercial enterprises in
the past, the new investment mandate for the SSI should focus exclusively on areas where public
involvement is essential. Transparency and accountability in its investment decisions will be
important; in this regard it is vital to strengthen the independence of SSI’s Board.
38.

Sustained and inclusive growth in Seychelles will require further reforms to support an
increased role for the private sector and competition. Key sectors that have been protected from
competition, such as in the provision of port services, should be opened up. Rapidly reducing crosssubsidization in electricity prices would enable the private sector to be more competitive and foster
growth. Development of the financial sector, entrepreneurship and SMEs will promote a dynamic
private sector that leads to a broad distribution of benefits. Staff commend the authorities for the
completion of the WTO accession process, which can help provide a more transparent and
predictable environment for both exporters and inward investment. Finally, inclusive growth will
require addressing skills mismatches in the labor market, as well as improved targeting of social
programs to support higher labor force participation.
39.

40.

Data are broadly adequate for surveillance. The recent achievement of compliance with the

SDDS is an important step forward in signaling commitment to timely and quality statistics, though
additional progress could be made improving the compilation of external statistics and the IIP.

In light of the authorities’ continued strong program implementation and determined
policy response to safeguard macroeconomic stability, staff supports the authorities’ request
for a waiver for end-2014 performance criterion on reserve money, for the completion of the
second review under the Extended Arrangement, and the modification of the quantitative
performance criteria for end-June and end-December 2015. It is recommended that the next
Article IV consultation with Seychelles be held in accordance with the decision on Article IV
Consultation Cycles adopted on September 28, 2010, as amended.

Annex I. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
Seychelles’ debt trajectory remains sustainable. Under the baseline scenario the country is on-track
to attain its longstanding goal of reducing debt below 50 percent of GDP by 2018, further
strengthening sustainability. At 18 percent of GDP, gross financing needs are high but are expected
to decline as domestic debt is reduced. External public financing needs are also significant but can
be readily met from financing expected from official multilateral and bilateral creditors.
Nevertheless, as a small island economy Seychelles remains vulnerable to a number of shocks which
could prevent the 2018 target from being realized.
Macroeconomic and fiscal assumptions. The assumptions underpinning the DSA are those of
the baseline scenario of the staff report, and broadly similar to those underlying the DSA at the
time of the program request. Real GDP growth is projected at 3.5 percent in 2015, remaining
around that level in the medium term. Inflation is projected at around 3 percent over the medium
term. The program primary fiscal surplus is expected to remain just under 4 percent until the
authorities’ overarching debt target is attained, after which it is projected to decline somewhat.1
Realism of baseline assumptions. The median forecast error for real GDP growth was 0.01, with
no significant upward or downward bias. While the projected primary balances imply a surplus in
the top quartile, Seychelles’ strong performance in the past means that this does not require any
significant fiscal adjustment.
The definition of public debt in this DSA includes: (i) central government debt as reported by
the authorities; (ii) government guarantees issued for loans extended to state-owned enterprises;
and (iii) obligations to the IMF. In view of the persistent excess liquidity in the Seychelles, debt
issued by the central government for monetary purposes is included in the public debt stock in
this analysis: for while there is an offsetting unremunerated deposit in the central bank, the debt
does impose an interest cost and rollover need for the public sector, and there is limited potential
for this debt to be unwound over the medium term.2 This DSA does not incorporate the impact of
the recent debt buy-back operation agreed with the Paris Club, given that the details of the
repayments to be made to the Seychelles Conservation and Climate Adaptation Trust have yet to
be finalized. However, given that the operation replaces obligations to the Paris Club with broadly
similar obligations (in PV terms) to the Trust, the net impact on debt sustainability will be limited,
albeit positive, and the conclusions of the DSA unchanged.3

1

The program primary surplus includes net lending to SOEs, reflecting the consideration that the PUC’s tariff
structure is insufficient to cover its capital costs.
2

In order to illustrate the impact of excluding debt issued for monetary purposes, the “net public debt” figures
shown in the tables consist of gross debt less the government deposits held at the central bank as a counterpart
to the sterilization operations. The net debt does not exclude other, smaller, government deposits which may be
required for cash management purposes etc.
3

The operation is expected to achieve a modest re-profiling and small shift to debt service in local currency. Debt
service is expected to fall by around $1.5-2.0 million per year in the period up to 2022 as a result of the operation,
but increase by a similar amount in the decade thereafter.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 29

SEYCHELLES

The DSA framework suggests that Seychelles’ public debt is currently slightly below the
high-risk benchmark and is falling rapidly. The DSA indicates that the debt remains high at
around 65 percent of GDP at end-2014, close to the 70 percent indicative threshold used in the
DSA framework to highlight high risk debt levels (red in the standardized heat map on page 4).
The slight increase from 2013 came despite the large primary budget surplus, and reflected the
depreciation of the rupee and the issuance of significant debt to mop up the structural excess
liquidity in the banking system. However, assuming the authorities’ commitment to debt
reduction and fiscal discipline remains unchanged, and that the economy suffers no major
negative shocks, the debt level is projected to fall by almost 25 percentage points in the medium
term under the baseline scenario, reaching 40 percent in 2020.
Gross financing needs, at 18 percent of GDP, are high but are expected to fall over the
medium term. Since the last DSA, the primary balance path has been revised upward in order to
attain the debt target in the face of the depreciation. The higher fiscal surpluses are assumed to
pay down short term domestic debt, in light of its higher interest rate and the rollover risks
posed.4 This reduction of short-term debt is also projected to improve the composition of debt
over the medium term, as the average maturity lengthens.
However, external public debt service will increase significantly over the medium term as
payments come due on the rescheduled Eurobond. In 2010, a new Eurobond was exchanged
for an existing bond, as part of Seychelles’ debt restructuring; with the new bond having a 6-year
grace period, 16 year maturity, and stepped-up interest rate schedule. The first payments on the
outstanding principal of $169 million fall due in the second half of 2016. While the resulting
higher debt service payments will put some additional pressure on the balance of payments, the
amounts – biannual principal payments in equal installments over a decade (i.e., $17 million a
year) – are expected to remain manageable in view of the country’s comfortable reserve position
and the expected external inflows.
While a large and growing proportion of the debt is owed to non-residents in foreign
currency, the risks are mitigated by the significant finance available on favorable terms
from official creditors. Similarly, while the economy’s large external financing needs pose risks,
in the past these needs have in large part been met through FDI (Annex 2). Any reduction in FDI
should also serve to reduce the FDI-related imports that account for a significant proportion of
the trade deficit.
Under a number of individual shock scenarios the debt-to-GDP ratio remains below the
corresponding high-risk benchmark of 70 percent. Under the growth shock, the debt-to-GDP
ratio would peak in 2017 and fall thereafter, but would remain 10 percentage points above the
50 percent target for 2018. A real exchange rate shock would see the debt increase slightly in
2016 but fall rapidly thereafter. Other one-time shocks to the primary balance and the real
interest rate would merely moderate the pace of the fall in the debt-to-GDP ratio, but would
delay the authorities’ attainment of their debt reduction goal by one or two years. A combined
macro-fiscal shock would send the debt-to-GDP ratio above the critical value of 70 percent. This
4

Staff will discuss the authorities’ debt plans over the medium term, including whether retaining some short term
debt would be advisable for market development purposes.
30 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SEYCHELLES

combined shock is an aggregation of the shocks to real growth, the interest rate, the primary
balance and the exchange rate. Under this scenario the debt-to-GDP ratio would peak close at
around 85-90 percent before falling gradually, while the debt-to-revenue ratio would increase to
almost 270 percent.
The public enterprises continue to pose risks to the achievement of the 2018 debt reduction
goal. The SOE contingent liability shock assumes that the government would have to assume
costs equivalent to five percent of GDP in 2017, equivalent to the liabilities assumed during the
Air Seychelles restructuring in 2012. Under this scenario, the 2018 debt target would be exceeded
by almost five percent of GDP, although over the medium term it would resume its downward
trajectory.
The baseline scenario and the numerous shocks produced by the DSA template indicate
that, while Seychelles remains very vulnerable to exogenous shocks, continued strong
policy implementation should see these risks diminish over the medium term. Under the
baseline, gross financing fall below the 15 percent indicative threshold by the end of the
projection period. While public debt as a percent of revenues remains at broadly sustainable
levels under the shock scenarios, gross financing needs increase significantly, especially under the
combined macro-fiscal shock or the real GDP growth shock, highlighting the need for continued
fiscal consolidation and growth to reduce risks. The authorities agreed with the broad conclusions
of the debt sustainability analysis, and stressed their commitment to continued debt reduction.

1/ Public sector is defined as central government and includes public guarantees, defined as .
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over German bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes changes in the stock of guarantees, asset changes, and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Annex 2. External Debt Sustainability Analysis
For the first time, this DSA includes data from the private sector and commercial SOEs.1
Consequently, the debt-to-GDP ratio at end-2014 is now estimated to be around 117 percent (this
newly collected data may very well be subject to revisions in the future). Despite this high number,
staff view the risks as mitigated in light of the composition of external debt and maturity profile.
The analysis suggests that the external debt burden remains stable and is projected to be on a
downward trajectory under the baseline scenario. However, given the country’s small size, large
external debt, and heavy import dependence, the debt trajectory remains sensitive to exogenous
shocks, especially in the exchange rate.
Seychelles’ debt stock consists largely of borrowing by the public and tourism sectors. As
of end 2014, one third of the country’s external debt is long-term government borrowing, largely
from official sources (Table 1). A further third is FDI-related borrowing, largely to the hotel sector,
and less than 20 percent of the debt is short-term, largely trade credits and other lines of credit.
The intra-company lending that accounts for a large portion of the debt stock is believed to pose
lower risks than unrelated lending, due, for example, to the greater ease of rescheduling in the
event of a downturn.2
The country’s external debt burden increased slightly in 2014, following a widening
current account deficit and the rupee depreciation. External debt stood at 117.1 percent of
GDP in 2014, 4.9 percentage points higher than in the previous year but considerably below the
levels prevailing during 2010-12 (Table 2). Large FDI inflows, lower-than-projected public
borrowing, and the fall in the Euro (over a quarter of the country’s debt stock is Eurodenominated) offset the wider current account deficit and the effect of the currency depreciation.
As a result of the compilation of data on the IIP, the CBS has revised the relative
composition of FDI from 2015 and beyond. While it had previously been assumed that
approximately 2/3 of FDI consisted of equity investments and the remaining fraction of debt
liabilities, recent data suggest that the debt component is larger. While the data for past years
have not yet been revised, the projections for 2015 and beyond incorporate the modified
assumption. This explains the increase in the stock of external debt to 130 percent of GDP in
2015 and the more modest contribution of non-debt creating capital inflows compared to
previous years. Under current policies, the external debt level is projected to fall gradually over
time.
1

As a result of data constraints, previous external DSAs for Seychelles focused exclusively on external government and
government-guaranteed debt. However, a Statistics TA mission conducted in February 2014 supported IIP compilation,
including improved coverage of the accounting data of SOEs, hotels, construction companies, deposit taking institutions and
other entities with considerable external assets and liabilities.

Standardized stress tests confirm that the country’s external debt is particularly sensitive
to currency depreciation shocks. A 30 percent depreciation of the domestic currency would
increase the external debt-to-GDP ratio almost 60 percent in the first year after the shock, and is
projected to remain considerably higher than the baseline by the end of period. While this
scenario does not account for beneficial second round effects coming from the improved
competitiveness and trade balance, it is reasonable to assume that these gains would be smaller
than in other countries, given the structural constraints to which a small, tourism-dependent
island economy like Seychelles is subject.
Interest rate, growth and current account shocks would have a more muted effect on the
debt profile. A ½ standard deviation increase in nominal external interest rates on new debt
over the period 2015–2020 would have minor consequences on the profile of the external debt
stock. This outcome is partly due to the relatively low and fixed interest rates that the country
contracted in the past, thanks in large part to the official sources that lent and restructured debt
at favorable rates, along with the current global low interest rate regime. A permanent
½ standard deviation shock to either growth or the current account (excluding interest
payments) would lead to a slow build up of the external debt-to-GDP ratio over time,
overshooting the baseline projection by about 10 percentage points in 2020.

Annex 3. Inward Spillovers and the Tourism Sector
Being a small and very open economy that relies heavily on imports and counts only one major export
service sector, Seychelles is naturally highly exposed to inward spillovers from the rest of the world. This
annex quantifies the domestic transmission mechanism to exogenous growth shocks and assesses the
business cycle properties of tourism flows conditional on the identified shock. To this end, a vector
autoregressive model (VAR) is estimated on annual data covering the period from 2000 to 2013.
Bayesian methods are adopted to cope with short sample problems, while the prior distributions of the
parameters are centered to the posterior values obtained from a panel-VAR for Seychelles, Mauritius
and Maldives in order to further tailor the model to regional-specific characteristics.1 The results
suggest that the domestic multiplier to an expansionary output shock in the Euro Area exceeds unity.
The short-run dynamics of private investment and trade are influenced to a considerable extent by the
economic performance of key source markets for tourists, which can be a source of vulnerability.
Diversification of tourism markets away from Europe would decrease sensitivity to economic
developments in a single region and enhance resilience. The creation of domestic value added can be
facilitated by further integrating domestic businesses into the tourism value chain.
Seychelles is considerably exposed to growth shocks coming from Europe. A one standard
deviation negative shock to Euro Area output reduces the number of tourist arrivals in Seychelles,
and has a contractionary effect on domestic output, which remains below its equilibrium level for
several years (Figure 1). Private investment falls on impact, as plans to improve the existing stock of
tourism facilities and the launch of new ones are temporarily reduced. The external balance
improves, which suggests that the imports of goods fall more than the exports of tourism services in
response to the shock.2
The domestic business cycle is linked to traditional source markets in Europe, although this
may change in the future as arrivals from emerging markets pick up. Domestic output in
Seychelles moves more than one-to-one in response to a growth shock in Europe, a fact that
confirms the strong link between the Seychelles and its traditional tourist source markets (Table 1).
The largest growth multiplier is observed with France (1.59), while Germany and Italy score 1.32 and
1.02 respectively. Therefore, the economy in Seychelles remains primarily exposed to growth
impulses from Europe, while emerging market countries are marginal for the domestic business cycle
as their growth, investment and current account multipliers are lower3. However, the situation may
change in the future as the number of arrivals from emerging markets rises further, and businesses
from those regions consolidate their presence in Seychelles. This will help to reduce the sensitivity of
1

Identification of the shock is obtained by means of a Cholesky decomposition of the posterior variance-covariance matrix of the
residuals. The variables are ordered as follows: source country output, tourist arrivals, real effective exchange rate, domestic output,
investment and the ratio of exports over imports of goods and services. For a similar application see F. Canova and P. Dallari “How
important is tourism for the international transmission of cyclical fluctuations? Evidence from the Mediterranean”, ECB Working
Paper No. 1553.
2
As most goods for consumption and investment are imported from abroad, a slowdown in domestic output is closely reflected in
imports’ dynamics. In fact, the correlation of imports with domestic (0.87) output is higher compared to the correlation between
exports and output (0.67) over the estimation sample.

the domestic cycle to economic developments in a single region, to increase the level of income
generated by tourism-related activities, and to make tourism flows more stable throughout the year.
In fact, compared to European tourists, tourists from the UAE have higher per capita expenditures,
and they reportedly tend to engage in high value added activities more often than Europeans tend
to do, such as shopping and sport fishing.4 Importantly, the geographical proximity to tourist
markets in Africa and the Arab peninsula can help to increase the share of repeat visitors in
Seychelles, which was only 10 percent of total tourist arrivals in 2014.

The tourism sector is a key channel for the transmission of inward spillovers from abroad, as
more than 30-60 percent of the international transmission of the shock can be traced to
tourism. The responses of domestic variables to a shock in output in the Euro Area are the sum of
two distinct effects: a pure output shock effect and an effect due to changes in tourism flows. The
first measures spin-offs due to the fact that shocks in source and destination country output may be
correlated; the second the indirect effect that source country output fluctuations may have via
tourism flows. A counterfactual simulation is used to estimate the response of domestic output in
Seychelles to the shock assuming that no change in tourist arrivals is observed.5 Absent the tourism
channel, domestic output would increase on impact 36 percent less than under the baseline
according to the central estimate, and 58 percent less compared to the upper bound of likely
outcomes (Figure 2, black line). In other words, within the first year from the shock, up to almost two
thirds of the expansion in domestic output occurs through tourism-related activities. As the growth
differential under the two scenarios is not limited to the first year, but instead remains stable
throughout the projection period, the cumulated (central) losses in terms of unrealized growth
potential can be substantial.

Equivalently, the indirect contribution to the growth multiplier coming from tourism is zeroed out, leaving only the pure output

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 43

SEYCHELLES

Income sensitive tourism flows and high concentration of investment plans in the tourism
sector constitute major vulnerabilities. The short-run elasticity of tourist arrivals to output shocks
is around two in all top European source markets (Table 1). The high elasticity of tourism flows to
available income may result from several factors, including the fact that Seychelles is perceived as a
luxury destination, a “once-in–a-lifetime” experience that European households undertake when
disposable income is high. Clearly, this leaves the domestic economy highly exposed to headwinds
from Europe. Also, the large elasticity of private domestic investment to the European business cycle
suggests that a relevant part of investment opportunities in Seychelles are related to the tourism
sector and dependent on factors that are exogenous to the local economy. This can jeopardize the
contribution of investment to growth, as private funds are used to finance facilities to serve the
tourism market, rather than projects aimed at improving the country’s infrastructure needs.
Future analysis should focus on linkages, especially the contribution of the tourism sector to
the domestic economy and on identifying ways to maximize the creation of value added onsite. The interconnectedness of Seychelles with the rest of the world is substantial, and it occurs for
the most part through the tourism industry. Future work will aim at identifying strategies to augment
the domestic component of tourism-related activities, and to maximize the benefits to the local
community that is generated from the industry. In principle, this may encompass a wide array of
topics, such as tax policies, financing incentives, or entertainment activities for tourists envisaging a
strong engagement from locals. Some progress in this direction has already been realized. The
number of guest houses has been increasing recently; compared to international hotel groups, guest
houses are more often managed by locals and have stronger linkages to the local economy. The
hotels too are increasingly focused on the local content and “flavor” of their product, whether it be
local fresh fish or offering excursions and water sports provided by local businesses.

Annex 4. External Stability and Competitiveness Assessment
Under the current policy plans, external stability is strengthening and near-term risks appear contained.
Reserve coverage is projected to remain at adequate levels, taking into account Seychelles’
vulnerabilities. Exchange rate flexibility has allowed the value of the Seychellois Rupee to remain
broadly in line with fundamentals.
Staff’s analysis suggests that the immediate risks to the external position appear manageable.
The balance of payments pressures that led to a 16 percent depreciation in the rupee percent against
the dollar in the second half of 2014 have abated as tourism recovered, such that the Central Bank
was able to make additional international reserves purchases. The current account deficit is expected
to fall over the medium term as FDI flows moderate, policy tightening has an effect, and the oil price
stabilizes at levels lower than those prevailing in the recent past. However, medium-term
vulnerabilities remain significant and need to be addressed through continued fiscal discipline,
structural reforms to support diversification of the economy, and exchange rate flexibility.

Seychelles remains a competitive destination for tourism. Its share in global tourist arrivals has
been growing gradually, during the last six years, though after an exceptional 2013 there was a slight
dip in 2014. Arrivals recovered towards the end of the year and closed 1 percent higher compared to
the previous year. As Seychelles’ traditional source markets are located in Europe, development of
the tourism sector has suffered from the region’s protracted slow growth. However, increased arrivals
from Germany partially offset the reduction

outlook for the island’s tourism industry.
More could be done to improve Seychelles’ attractiveness to investors, both foreign and
domestic. According to the World Bank Doing Business indicators, access to electricity, starting a
business and credit availability are particular areas of weakness, although the country’s scores
improved in contract enforcement and the process of resolving insolvency, both relevant for the
tourism industry as they are conducive to foreign investments (see Text Figure 3). However,
additional actions from the authorities, leading to a more expeditious improvement in the overall
doing business indicators, are recommended.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 45

The path of international reserves is projected to remain at adequate levels over the medium
term, after taking account of expected pressures. Seychelles’ reserves as of end-2014 appear
comfortable by the IMF’s composite metric, as well as the other commonly-used rules of thumb,
even after reflecting the higher private debt in the new International Investment Position data (which
might be subject to revision). The import coverage ratio reached 4.6 months in 2014, higher than
projected, thanks to the rapid decline of the oil price which contributed to reducing the country’s
import bill (Table 1). At the same time, the Central Bank of Seychelles capitalized on favorable
developments in the market for foreign exchange to further strengthen its international reserves
buffer.1 The projections for outer years indicate a marginal decline in reserve coverage as the debt
service due on the Eurobond begins to fall due, and as inflows of foreign capital stabilize.
As of end-2014, the real exchange rate of the Seychellois Rupee appears to be in line with
medium-term fundamentals. Staff’s empirical strategy follows Vitek’s “Exchange Rate Assessment
Toolkit” (2012), based on the application of three CGER approaches: macroeconomic balance (MB),
external sustainability (ES) and equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER).2 The results are broadly
congruous across the three methodologies. The estimated exchange rate misalignment is
comparable to past trends, and it falls within the statistical confidence interval. The forecasts carried
over the projection horizon point to the beneficial role that the rupee depreciation played starting
from end 2014 to help contain an incipient exchange rate misalignment that had built up in the first
half of the year.
The MB approach shows that the measured real exchange rate misalignment, which was
around 5 percent in 2013, increased in 2014 but is expected to recover promptly in the
following years.

According to the ERER results, the equilibrium exchange rate has remained fairly constant
since 2008, while the monthly observations capture the rising undervaluation, which
bottomed by the last quarter of 2014. The estimated real exchange rate misalignment remains
roughly stable compared to the previous year, and the confidence bands around the central estimate

The ES approach also captures the widening current account deficit and correspondingly
detects a real exchange rate overshooting. However, the widening current account is temporary in
nature and the misalignment small in size. As the newly adopted methodology to estimate tourism
earnings led to a remarkable increase in the value of service exports, the current account norm under
the ES approach is now estimated around -12 percent of GDP, in line with the MB approach.

Annex 5. The Medium-Term Fiscal Challenges
Seychelles has made considerable progress over the last six years in restoring fiscal discipline, reducing
debt, and improving public financial management. In order to ensure that fiscal policy continues to
support inclusive growth over the medium term, the authorities should focus on: avoiding an erosion of
the revenue base; improving the quality of expenditures by tying the budget process, and in particular
capital expenditure, more closely to the medium-term priorities; and improving the governance
structure of the SOEs to minimize risks to the public balance sheet.
Introduction
In response to the 2008 public debt crisis, the Seychellois authorities undertook a
comprehensive reform of their fiscal framework. The reforms aimed to deliver a sustainable and
effective public sector while at the same time reducing the country’s vulnerabilities by cutting the
public debt burden by nearly two-thirds, to below 50 percent of GDP by 2018. The introduction of a
VAT and income tax and reform of business tax modernized the tax system by broadening the
revenue base, and simplifying and reducing rates. Revenue administration was overhauled with the
incorporation of risk assessment and improved technology. The legal basis for taxation was also
reformed with the passage of a new Revenue Management Act in 2011 and legislation introducing
the new taxes.
At the same time fiscal expenditures were rationalized. This effort included a voluntary departure
and early retirement scheme which led to a reduction in government employment by some 2,500
employees (about 15 per cent of the public sector workforce). Primary current expenditure, which
had averaged 38 percent of GDP in 2000 to 2008, fell by 16 percentage points to 22 percent in 2009–
2014 as the overall balance swung from a deficit to a large surplus. The management of public
expenditure was reformed with the introduction of a Treasury Single Account, a new chart of
accounts to allow for functional classification, and a new Public Enterprise Monitoring and Control
Act that established financial reporting obligations and corporate governance guidelines for all
public entities and laid the groundwork for the preparation of IPSAS cash-based financial statements
for all SOEs.

Revenue effort in Seychelles
Government revenue as a percentage of GDP in Seychelles is relatively high compared with
other countries in the region as well as other small island states (Text table 1). From 2008–2012
the tax system was reformed with a view to broadening the base and reducing rates: a flat-rate
personal income tax replaced the social security tax, the sales tax was replaced with a VAT, and

This overall positive picture, however, conceals some less favorable trends. In particular,
business taxes have been somewhat disappointing, falling from a peak of 6.9 percent of GDP in 2009
to 4.2 percent in 2014. This fall cannot be wholly ascribed to major policy changes during these
years, so it must reflect either lower declared profitability of domestic companies or reduced
compliance. Given Seychelles’ relatively robust growth in the post-crisis period, some issues of
compliance and transfer pricing seem likely. Seychelles’ business tax is relatively narrowly based, with
30 companies accounting for over two-thirds of the tax business tax take, with tourism-related
companies substantially underrepresented.
In part, the relatively low business tax take from the hotel industry reflects the lingering
effects of generous incentives. Under the revised taxation system, tourism-related services (along
with some other industries such as agriculture and fisheries) continue to benefit from a special rate
of business tax: 15 percent compared with the regular 30-33 percent rate. Moreover, accommodation
providers benefit from a generous schedule of accelerated depreciation on investments. In this
context the authorities introduced two turnover taxes, a Marketing Tourism Tax payable by tourism
operators, banks, telecom operators and insurance companies, and a Corporate Social Responsibility
charge, applied more generally to businesses with a turnover in excess of SR1 million. While turnover
taxes avoid many of the tax evasion strategies that can be applied to corporate income taxes, they
have a disproportionate impact on high turnover/low margin businesses, and their lack of
deductibility implies some regression towards the cumulative taxation that characterized the prereform period.

Several countries justify lower VAT on hotels in light of the potential for job creation, particularly in a context of high
youth unemployment, whereas Seychelles already imports significant labor for the hotel industry.

Over the medium term the authorities should consider further measures to streamline
business taxation. The continued existence of three different business tax rates (15 percent,
30 percent, and 33 percent) is suboptimal and can distort economic decision-making. A single,
harmonized rate would therefore be preferable, assuming that this could be achieved in a way that
does not undermine revenue efforts. Allowing the turnover taxes to be deducted against business tax
should also be considered, as this would eliminate the aspect of cumulative taxation. While there
would be some decline in revenue, this could potentially be offset by an increase in the rates to bring
them closer to the rates for the non-tourism sector.
One further element of tax reform that was recommended by Fund technical assistance but
not yet implemented was adjusting specific tax rates on excisables for inflation. The Fund’s
review of taxes noted that excise on fuel in particular was low by international standards, and
recommended an immediate increase above and beyond inflation, and inflation indexation
thereafter. However, while excise on tobacco and spirits was increased in the 2014 budget, the tax
rate on fuels remains unchanged in nominal terms since 2008, at 8 SR/liter for motor spirits, although
the CPI has doubled since then.2 Measures to halt this erosion of the real value of fuel taxes would
support the debt reduction objectives, benefit the environment, and be particularly apposite given
the very low global fuel prices.
The government has also expressed interest in introducing a measure of progressivity to
income tax over the medium term: at present the income tax is a flat rate with zero
exemptions. Introducing different marginal tax rates could be desirable from a social equity
perspective, particularly given the large income disparities revealed by the past household survey.
However, staff stressed the important consideration that successful introduction will require
overcoming capacity constraints at the SRC, as well as supporting the employers that will be required
to help administer the system. The authorities might also consider other measures such as a real
estate tax with a high exemption, either as an alternative or complement: this would be simpler to
administer and harder to evade, while still generating the desired social outcomes.
Key Trends in Government Expenditure
Between 2009 and 2014 total government expenditure increased by less than one percent of
GDP, at the same time as primary current

GDP: however this understates the true cost, since administrative and accounting changes meant
that part of the increased wage bill was reclassified as transfers.

Whilst the post-crisis period was characterized by a growth in primary spending enabled by
falling interest payments, this pattern will not be repeated in the coming years. At only just
over two percent of GDP, interest payments have limited room to fall further. Moreover, with
pressing investment needs including in water, sewage and electricity, the share of capital expenditure
and net lending as a percentage of GDP should be increasing.3 In this context, maintaining a firm
grip on current spending will be essential. While expenditure on wages and salaries is not out of line
with other small island states, the rate of increase over the last two years could not be sustained long
into the future, since other expenditures are already being crowded out: the World Bank’s Public
Expenditure Review on the education sector noted that in 2012 over 90 percent of current
expenditures were being spent on staff wages and benefits, reducing the room for vital investments
in learning materials and training.
Public Financial Management Reforms
The reform program also encompassed major changes to public financial administration. The
adoption of a Treasury Single Account and a forecasting and analysis bureau represented major
improvements to cash management and budget credibility. The monitoring of SOEs was overhauled
with the 2010 passage of the Public Enterprise Monitoring and Control Act, which mandated
comprehensive reporting to the Public Enterprise Monitoring Division, which was later established as
a separate commission. Considerable progress has been made in improving the accounting
framework, and more comprehensive financial statements are now being prepared in accordance
with the cash-based IPSAS methodology. The previously ad hoc approach to public investment was
improved with the introduction of a Public Sector Investment Program (PSIP) in 2013 to set out
planned capital investment over the medium term.

3

Much of the investment program of the Public Utilities Corporation is supported by on-lending from the central
government.
52 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SEYCHELLES

Despite this considerable progress, more remains to be done to deliver an efficient and
effective public sector. Adoption of a full medium-term budget framework will require moving
towards a more comprehensive, top-down budget process, wherein rolling multi-year expenditure
plans are prepared, and indicative ceilings are issued to ministries at the beginning of the annual
budget process to guide ministries’ budget submissions. Budget credibility must also be improved
by reducing forecasting error: while revenue projections are much improved and generally accurate,
expenditures—and in particular investment spending—remains an area of concern. Some of the
PUC’s larger projects, for example, have been significantly delayed, while other projects (such as the
purchase of replacement generation capacity) were brought forward.
Improvements to the capital expenditure process are warranted throughout the project cycle:
in project selection, implementation, operation, monitoring and evaluation. The establishment
of a Development Committee to oversee implementation of the PSIP, and ensure its consistency with
the National Development Strategy, is a critical step, but it will be important to ensure that it has a
clear role, and the ability to exercise that role. In particular, it will need the capacity to conduct an
independent assessment of the economic feasibility of large projects before they can proceed. At the
same time, it will be important to ensure sufficient training of staff at the Finance Ministry and
project-implementing ministries and agencies to implement, monitor, and evaluate the capital
expenditures.
Capacity-building will also be important if the Public Enterprise Monitoring Commission is to
exercise effective vigilance over the SOE sector. Strong accounting skills in particular are essential
to assess where risks are emerging and flag concerns early. Moreover, the entire governance
framework should be reconsidered if early warning signs of financial problems are to be translated
into action and if new investment or expansion projects are to be properly vetted. At present, Société
Seychelloise d’Investissement (SSI) is intended to exercise a fiduciary role over the commercial SOEs.
However, the Board of the SSI consists largely of the CEOs of the very companies which it oversees.
These companies are also engaged in transactions with the SSI itself, for example over the use of its
land resources. These circumstances raise questions about it playing a role of genuinely independent
oversight and control.

Annex 6. Sources of Growth
Introduction
Growth in Seychelles averaged 4.5 percent between 1969 and 2013, compared to 3.8 percent
for Sub-Saharan Africa. To determine drivers of growth in Seychelles, this study used the CobbDouglas production function which assumes constant returns to scale. The production function was
augmented for skilled labor.

The production function is as follows:
Yt=AtKtαLt 1-α
Y =domestic output,
K = capital stock
L= labor
α is the partial elasticity of output with respect to capital. Since we assume constant returns to scale,
1- α is the partial elasticity of output with respect to labor and t is time. A, is total factor productivity.
We can differentiate the production function as follows:
dY/Y=dA/A+α dK/K+(1-α)dL/L
The contribution to domestic output by each factor can now be determined and total factor
productivity (TFP), is calculated as residual—captures the impact of other factors such as institutions,
infrastructure etc on growth.
Ls =SL
Where Ls = skill augmented labor.
dY/Y=dA/A+α dK/K+(1-α)dLs/Ls
Capital Stock
Capital stock was derived following the equation below:
Kt=(1- δ)Kt-1+It
δ is the depreciation rate and I is gross capital formation. The data were sourced from the World
Development Indicators of the World Bank. These data were then used to calculate the initial capital

stock following the Harberger approach. Also three depreciation rates were used in the analysis.
Choice of depreciation rate is of particular importance as errors in the choice of depreciation rate
could accumulate in subsequent years.

Labor is not augmented and 2000s include 2013.
Using a depreciation rate of 7 percent in the traditional model in which labor is not
augmented, output has been driven more by capital accumulation (Figure 1). Total Factor
Productivity has been negative in both 90s and 2000s. Low or even negative TFP is not uncommon in
middle income small island economies, with the exception of Mauritius (Figure 2).

Analysis using augmented labor changes the results, increasing the contribution of TFP.
However, since Seychelles does not readily have data on average years of schooling, enrolment rate
was used as a proxy. As could be seen above, production has been mainly capital driven in Seychelles
from the 1980s to 2013. The results also indicate that skilled labor is of particular importance to
Seychelles. Inclusion of skilled augmented labor in the model led to positive TFP in 2000s. Two other
scenarios were examined—depreciation rate of 5 percent and 10 percent which also gave similar
results.

Our results suggest that the reforms of the 2000s, and particularly those implemented

essential precondition for further growth. However, in order for the economy to achieve its full
potential, further measures should be considered, including: 1) increasing savings and investment
rates, including improving access to credit, 2) reforms to encourage greater labor market
participation , 3) accelerating investment in education to address existing skills mismatches, and 4)
broader reforms to improve the business climate, including strengthening for the role of the private
sector by reducing regulation and enhancing competition, and improving governance of the SOEs to
strengthen their finances and focus their activities on their core mandates.

Annex 7. Establishing a Macroprudential Framework
In response to rising concerns about financial stability risks going forward, the Seychelles authorities
have decided to move expeditiously toward the creation of a macroprudential framework. Available
indicators do not, as of now, signal a need to activate additional policy measures to address bank
exposure to macrofinancial risks (see figure below), but the fast increase of bank credit to the private
sector requires close monitoring. Moreover, gaps in available data need to be addressed as a
precondition to comprehensive analysis of financial vulnerabilities. Policy responses should be
considered and implemented by a Financial Stability Committee (FSC) to be established in the near
future.1
Structure of the financial system in Seychelles. The financial system in Seychelles is small and
dominated by three commercial banks. Bank and nonbank lending amount to 32 percent of GDP.
Bank assets comprise 97 percent of all financial sector assets. Three banks (two of which are majority
foreign-owned, the other majority government-owned) hold 85 percent of all bank assets. While
interconnectedness between banks appears to be weak, the high concentration implies substantial
systemic risk for each of the larger banks. The sectoral distribution of bank credit reflects the
undiversified structure of the economy: 43 percent of bank lending is directed to construction, real
estate, and tourism. Banks are regulated and supervised by the CBS, following Basel I.2 Banks report
aggregate data on core financial soundness indicators (CAR, ROA, ROE, NPL, as well as some liquidity
and cost indicators) on a monthly basis.

Cyclical, balance sheet, and capital exposures. A snapshot of selected indicators for credit cycle,
balance sheet risks, and loss-absorbing buffers indicates that rapid credit growth appears to have
been the main driver of potential exposure to the build-up of systemic risk in 2014. Measured
against economic activity, credit to the private sector suffered from a steady decline since 2010,
before recovering in 2014. Tourism, real estate, mortgage, and trade are the most prominent drivers
of overall credit growth, which nevertheless did not increase concentration risks. Moreover, other
available indicators of bank balance-sheet health and capital buffers are broadly benign and do not
indicate a build-up of systemic risk.
Major sources of risk and stress-testing. The analysis of the structure of the commercial banking
system’s balance sheet reveals vulnerabilities from credit exposure to the tourism sector, potential
real estate bubbles, and (to a lesser extent) foreign-exchange funding withdrawals in the offshore
sector. Stress-testing exercises undertaken in the past focused on sensitivity analysis of isolated
shocks to the capital-adequacy ratio of banks. While useful, the lack of granular data and of models
to calibrate shocks and their impacts has revealed the need to move toward a more systemic
approach. A TA mission from MCM in early 2015 introduced to CBS staff improved templates for
conducting stress test exercises, with a view to using scenarios derived from a globally and
domestically informed risk-assessment matrix (RAM); work on this is continuing. First-glance systemic
indicators appear benign, but they are surrounded by considerable uncertainty. Further analysis,
tools, and institutions need to be set up for an in-depth assessment and treatment of systemic risks
that transcend monetary policy.

Currently available data and indicators have limitations. With shallow financial markets, price
indicators from secondary markets are largely nonexistent. Macroprudential surveillance will need to
rely primarily on balance sheet-based indicators rather than market price-based indicators.3
However, the current balance sheet-based core indicators, as provided by banks through the

comparatively better at identifying potential spillovers.

SEYCHELLES

monthly reporting system, are not yet sufficient for comprehensive monitoring of financial stability.
First, the reported data lack granularity. For example, NPLs are currently not broken down by sector.
Second, important information reflecting lending standards (such as LTV, DSTI) is not reported. Third,
and perhaps most importantly, there are no data reports on changes in the prices of houses and real
estate properties. However, there is considerable unrealized potential for improving indicators: Large
banks already base their lending practices on internal standards on LTV, LTI, and DSTI, and an
efficient reporting system that would allow cross-dimensional analysis of loan data appears feasible.
With technical assistance, the National Bureau of Statistics should be able to collect data and
construct an index on real estate and house prices.
Policy tools. Given the volatile external environment of Seychelles, it appears that broad-based
policy tools, such as countercyclical buffer adjustments to the CAR, would not appear to be very
efficient and practical (though sector-specific adjustments in risk-weights might be). In comparison,
LTV and DSTI ratios for household lending could be adjusted more rapidly and forcefully, for
example when there are mutually supporting indications of rising house prices, credit increase, a
widening current account deficit in conjunction with rising imports, and an appreciating real
exchange rate.
Institutional setup. The Seychelles authorities are addressing these challenges by setting up a
macroprudential framework. Given the overlap between monetary policies and financial stability
measures, the division of labor between different regulators (such as the FSA for nonbank financial
services), and the strong role of the public sector in the banking system, the best solution appears to
create an inter-agency Financial Stability Committee (FSC), in which the CBS would take a leading
role. A small macroprudential technical unit in the CBS, forged from bank supervisors and
macroeconomists, would inform the FSC on an ongoing basis.

Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
May 14, 2015
Dear Ms. Lagarde:
1.
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) describes Seychelles'
recent performance as well as our policies for the period 2015–16.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 60

2.
The IMF Executive Board on June 4, 2014 approved our request for a 3-year arrangement
under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) for an amount of SDR 11.445 million (105 percent of quota).
Seychelles has met all the quantitative Performance Criteria for end-December 2014 in the EFFsupported program (Table 1), with the exception of the performance criterion on reserve money, for
which we are requesting a waiver. We met the two end-December 2014 structural benchmarks (SBs)
on time, as well as the one from end-June 2014, albeit with a substantial delay. We have met the
end-March SB with some delay as Cabinet only approved the policy paper on the 6th of May 2015.
We are on track to complete the other measures envisioned in the SBs for end-May and end-June
(Table 2). Based on our performance under the program and the sustainability of our planned
policies, we are requesting through this letter that the IMF Executive Board complete the second
review of the EFF-supported program and approve the associated purchase of the third tranche of
SDR 1.635 million (15 percent of quota).
3.
We believe that the economic and financial policies set forth in the MEFP are sufficient to
ensure that the objectives of the program will be met. The program’s proposed quantitative
Performance Criteria and Indicative Targets, as described in the Technical Memorandum of
Understanding, and proposed structural benchmarks for end-December 2015 are set out in Tables 1
and 2. We stand ready to take any further measures that may prove necessary to meet our
objectives. We will consult with the Fund on the adoption of these measures, and in advance of
revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP, in accordance with the Fund’s policies on such
consultations.
4.
In line with our commitment to transparency, we request that the IMF publish this letter, the
MEFP, the technical memorandum of understanding (TMU, which is unchanged from the last review),
and the staff report. We will simultaneously publish these documents in Seychelles.
Sincerely yours,
/s/

Recent economic developments and performance under the program

1.
The implementation of the program supported by the Extended Fund Facility approved by
the Executive Board of the IMF on June 4, 2014 is proceeding with determination, and we have
respected all but one of the quantitative performance criteria established for end December 2014.
The end-December ceiling for average reserve money was exceeded by 0.4 percent, and we are
requesting a waiver for this minor and temporary non-compliance. In particular, the net international
reserves target for end-2014 was exceeded by the equivalent of US$22 million, when reserves are
valued at the program exchange rate. In the structural reform area, we implemented the agreed
reform program; we met the two end-December 2014 structural benchmarks (SBs) on time, as well as
the one from end-June 2014, albeit with a substantial delay. We have met the end-March SB with a
delay; this was mainly because of further discussions required with stakeholders, as the policy
includes the commercial enterprises that are established as limited liability companies under and
subject to the Companies Act.
2.
As we described in the Letter of Intent of November 14, 2014, macroeconomic performance
in 2014 has met some challenges, in particular in the balance of payments area, as the wage increase
to civil servants granted at the beginning of 2014 and the acceleration in credit to the private sector
led to an increase in import in the third quarter and the emergence of pressures on the exchange
rate starting in July. The pressures abated towards the end of the year, as the result of tightening of
monetary policy and also because of the decline in the international petroleum prices that led to
significant savings in the monthly petroleum import bill. In 2014 the real GDP growth rate, at
3.3 percent, was somewhat higher than projected at the time of the first review, while the decline in
international petroleum prices resulted in an almost stable consumer price index in the 12 month to
end- December 2014. The external current account deficit was lower than projected at the time of
the first review by 1.5 percentage points of GDP, because of lower oil prices and higher estimate for
tourism earnings resulting from a revised methodology.
3.
In the budgetary area, in 2014 we achieved a higher primary surplus target than programmed
(4.6 percent of GDP as against 4.4 percent programmed), owing to overachievement in revenue
collection. Revenue and grants reached 35.7 percent of GDP compared with a target of 35.3 percent,
and revenue, at 32.8 percent of GDP, exceeded the target also by 0.3 percent of GDP.
4.
On the tax revenue side, there was a strong overperformance of receipts under value added
tax, trade tax and excise tax because of strong growth of imports and domestic demand, spurred by
(i) the wage increase granted to public sector workers at the beginning of the year which was
matched in the private sector, and, (ii) by the government-backed incentive scheme for borrowing by
small and medium scale enterprises. Income tax and business tax receipts fell modestly below the
target. Non-tax revenues were lower than targeted by 10 percent, as a result of lower dividends.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 61

5.
On the expenditure side primary current expenditures were in line with the target at
24.7 percent of GDP, while capital expenditure, at 5.5 percent of GDP, modestly exceeded the target
(by 0.2 percent of GDP). Wages and salaries reached 6.8 percent of GDP, up from 6.1 percent in 2013
as a result of the wage increase granted at the beginning of the year. The government focused on
implementing the capital budget and was able to improve the execution rates of domestically
financed capital projects, while projects with external loan financing encountered delays due to
technical difficulties in implementation.
B. Policies for 2015
I.

Macroeconomic prospects

6.
In 2015 we expect real GDP growth to accelerate modestly to 3.5 percent, up from
3.3 percent in 2014. Inflation for the 12 months of 2015 is expected to come close to 5 percent,
because of the pass-through of the depreciation of the exchange rate, which is however partially
offset by the decline in international prices of fuel. We expect the balance of payments deficit on
current account to show a marked decline from 2014 (from 21 percent of GDP to 15 percent), as
petroleum import costs will decline significantly. Tourism earnings valued in US dollars could decline
modestly, because a large part of hotel tariffs are priced in the weakening euro. In line with program
objectives, we are targeting stable net international reserves, in dollar terms, which offsets a
substantial negative valuation effect from international exchange rate movements of early 2015.
Debt policy will be prudent, with the aim to reduce the public debt/GDP ratio by around three
percent to 62 percent of GDP.
II. Fiscal policies
7.
The budget for 2015 aims at achieving a primary surplus target of SR 720 million, as
indicated in the previous letter of intent. This is equivalent to 3.7 percent of projected GDP.
Following the strong performance of consumption taxes in 2014, we aim to strengthening in 2015
revenue performance in the area of business tax, and to that end we are taking a number of
measures which include: (i) online submission of tax returns and expanded e-payment facilities;
(ii) strengthening capability to analyze transfer pricing; (iii) conducting 60 audits of large businesses
(SB), with the assistance of externally recruited auditors, and using a risk management process to
prioritize audits; (iv) improve collection of tax arrears; (v) improving customs compliance;
(vi) simplifying procedures of excise tax collection at customs.
8.
On the expenditure side, primary current expenditure as a share of GDP would decline by
1 percentage point to 23.6 percent, thanks to wage restraint and tight control of expenditure on
goods and services. Capital expenditure would rise by 0.7 percentage points to 6.2 percent of GDP,
with significantly higher capital grants, owing to larger external assistance.
III. Tax policy and Improvements in tax administration
9.
SRC is undertaking a comprehensive action plan to improve compliance level and enhance
revenue collection for 2015, as detailed below.
62 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SEYCHELLES

III.1. Introducing online submission of Business Tax Returns and expand e-payment facilities
10.
To facilitate and improve voluntary compliance SRC will be introducing online submission of
Business Tax Returns and expanding e-payment facility to include two additional banks (MCB and
Nouvobanq) in 2015. The online submission of business tax return is on schedule for testing in midMarch and expected to become operational in April 2015.
III.2. Building Transfer Pricing Analysis Capability
11.
As transfer pricing becomes a growing concern nationally and in the region, SRC are taking
steps to combat and deter transfer pricing. SRC has developed an action plan to build capacity to
tackle the risks posed by transfer pricing. The plan includes:a)
Public Ruling of Section 54 of the Business Tax – to explain SRC’s view on when and how SRC
will use Section 54 of the Business Tax Act. This will also include requirement of transfer
pricing documentation. The ruling is currently in draft and will be distributed to tax
practitioners for input as part of the consultation process.
b)

Training of staff – development of a Transfer Pricing Manual/Procedure guide that explains
SRC’s audit transfer pricing issues. On the job training and mentoring of local staff will be
conducted by expatriate auditors and other technical specialists as appropriate.

c)

Enhance working relationship between Customs and Tax - improve sharing of information
and the working relationship between Post Clearance Audit (PCA) and intelligence/audit
section in tax. Work to train Tax staff in the use of ASYCUDA World has commenced to
support this process.

d)

FIU Assistance/Training – Liaise with recently recruited FIU advisor for potential assistance
and training.

III.3. Conducting Business Tax Audits of 60 businesses from January to September 2015 to
improve revenue collection especially business tax
12.
SRC have identified the list of 60 businesses that will be audited from January to September
2015. Some of the cases have already been allocated to the auditors.
III.4. Improving collection of tax arrears
13.
SRC have introduced a strategic approach to dealing with outstanding tax debt. An
enforcement strategy for reduction of debt has been developed.
The SRC strategy has two parts:
First, an amnesty on business tax due as at December 2013, and other taxes (including taxes
outstanding with Customs) due as at December 2014. The amnesty will apply on arrears due as at
December 2013, as follows:

100 percent of penalties to be waived on arrears cleared by May 31, 2015;

50 percent of penalties to be waived on arrears cleared by August 31, 2015;

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 63

SEYCHELLES



25 percent of penalties to be waived on arrears cleared by October 31, 2015. SRC is
proactively promoting the amnesty in their dealings with clients (tax payers and importers) to
encourage them to pay outstanding debts during the amnesty period.

Second, to complement the amnesty other measures have been proposed including:

Proactively seeking payment of taxes that are due monthly, especially VAT & Income Tax
(stop the growth of debt)

Monitoring the top 100 Business taxpayers (Pay As You Go) for early warning/weak signal
analysis

Using more frequent and intensive field visits to enforce payment

Proactively managing the outstanding debts with Customs by introducing a unit to manage,
monitor and undertake field work for Customs debts

Undertaking a reconciliation process of outstanding and duplicate Bills of Entry created in the
period of transition from ASYCUDA ++ to ASYCUDA World (June 2013 – June 2014)

More extensive use of Legislative Provisions such as:
o Garnishee Notices
o Seizure of Assets
o Departure Prohibition Order (some success in late 2014)
o Tax Clearance Certificate prior to awarding Government contract
o Liquidation of persistent non-complying companies or bankruptcy.
III. 5. Capacity building in Post Clearance Audit (PCA) and Investigation
14.
To address the increasing issue of fraudulent documents provided to Customs in attempts to
evade correct payment of duty and/or taxes both the PCA and investigation capability has been
improved through formal training through international agencies (e.g. INTERPOL) and specialist
mentoring from SRC’s Customs Advisors and other agencies (e.g. IMF TAs). The PCA function will be
focused on working with importers to improve compliance.
III. 6. Customs Compliance Program
15.
SRC acknowledge that the level of non-compliance in relation to Customs requirements is
intrinsically linked to the poor levels of professional knowledge in the Customs Agent and Direct
Trader/importer population. Customs have plans to develop the Customs Compliance Program,
which is a Diploma level course aimed at addressing the deficiencies that cause delays for trade and
result in the incorrect taxes and duties being applied to imports.
The Customs Compliance Program will also help Customs move closer to developing an Authorized
Economic Operator program and move to a true risk-based approach to trade facilitation.
III. 7. Excise
16.
Excise has been a main focus for SRC since the first IMF mission in November 2013 when
estimated excise leakage in Seychelles was thought to be at a level of up to 60 percent. Although the
first stage of changes have been made, there are still a number of important projects that need to be

64 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SEYCHELLES

completed for Customs to gain control over alcohol, tobacco and fuel to ensure that due excise is
collected including:

Alignment of the Seychelles excise tax regime with the other SADC member states with the
view to harmonize excise tax laws within the region. scheduled to commence in June 2015

Implementation of a ‘Customs registration process’ for licensed excise operators

Establishment of a framework for the removal of excise collection through CMS and enabling
electronic collection through ASYCUDA World (i.e. Customs to take full ownership of excise)

Drafting legislative amendments to provide excise officers with the required powers to
effectively monitor excise manufacturers and enforce penalties for non-compliance

Proposed implementation of the tax stamp initiative as a control tool

Apply findings of the recent SEYPEC systems audit and implement Customs control measures
to eliminate the non-sanctioned use of duty-free fuel in Seychelles.
IV. Public Financial Management and Expenditure Reform
IV.1. MTFF
17.
The Medium Term Fiscal Framework benchmark was approved by the Cabinet in November
2014. In 2015, the MTFF will mark the first step in the formulation of the 2016 Budget by establishing
indicative Budget ceilings over a five year period. A Fiscal working group has been established,
comprising of members from MoFTBE divisions to ensure the consistent updating of the MTFF
variables and resolve issues.
18.
Moving forward, the major task remaining is setting up the proper policy framework to
incorporate in the medium term. This will establish integrated multi-year policy-based targets for the
main fiscal aggregates—debt, financing, primary balance, revenues and expenditures—consistent
with the overall macroeconomic framework. With this incorporated, the MTFF will provide the
foundation for a full MTBF, which will allow for an improved process for the allocation of budgetary
resources.
IV.2. PPBB
19.
The Program Performance Based Budgeting (PPBB) has been adopted for the first two pilot
ministries in 2015. Despite some challenges to migrate towards this new method of budgeting the
two portfolios are operating with the continuous support of the World Bank (WB) and the Ministry of
finance. In addition three other pilot ministries and their related agencies have also joined the
piloting process with their second technical assistance from the WB that had completed in March
2015, which resulted in finalizing the program structures and migration of their spending to PPBB
baselines. Next mission will cover developing portfolio medium term expenditure strategies.
IV.3. PFM Action Plan
20.
The authorities will also ensure continuous improvement in the public financial management
(PFM) by adopting a new PFM action plan 2015–2018. This updated plan is geared towards
improvement in capital project cash and asset management as well as an improved medium term
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 65

SEYCHELLES

budget framework (MTBF) so as to better improve on medium term budgeting across MDAs. More
emphasis will also be placed on the management of state-owned enterprises though management
and governance audits so as to further enhance SOE transparency and governance and enhance SOE
efficiency and delivery of public services. A new Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability
assessment, to be carried out in 2015, will help set these priorities.
IV.4. PIM
21.
A Development Committee has been appointed in March 2015 to ensure that all public
sector capital projects over R10 m in the Public Sector Investment Program, PSIP are coordinated and
appraised before final approval and funding is catered. With key technical assistance from the World
Bank guidelines on capital project management with templates for project submission and appraisal
for various types/groups of projects are to be developed. The authorities will also ensure that
adequate training for projects officers and decision makers in project appraisal are provided.
IV.5. IPSAS
22.
Government for the second year will be producing the annual audited financial reports in
accordance to internationally recognize public sector accounting standards (IPSAS). The aim for the
2014 audited financial report is to have a full consolidation of State-Owned Enterprise with central
Government. This will enable Government to have a consolidate overview of the cashflows of central
Government and SOEs. For the year 2014 accounts, Government is working closely with Auditor
General to ensure all queries are discussed early so that the audited accounts are submitted around
July 2015.
IV.6. Cash Management
23.
The government will further re-enforce the Treasury single account (TSA) by improving the
reporting of all balances of commercial bank accounts outside of the TSA. This will allow
comprehensive reporting of all commercial bank balances held by the MDAs and subordinate
agencies through Quarterly reconciliation of all government’s budget dependent entities’
commercial bank accounts which is to be submitted to Treasury.
This will therefore facilitate annual reporting of the government financial statement as all such
accounts will be captured and account balances disclosed.
IV.7. Public Private Partnership (PPP)
24.
Development of a Public Private Partnership Framework
The Government remains committed to putting in place a comprehensive Public Private Partnership
(PPP) framework to support the transition of the Seychelles economy towards greater private sector
participation and economic contribution. The framework also aims at ensuring value for money from
PPPs as well as limiting fiscal risks.
The first phase for the development of the framework which is the preparation of a PPP policy has
been launched with the assistance of the Investment Climate Facility for Africa (ICF).
A needs assessment has been conducted involving the following:
66 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SEYCHELLES

1.
2.
3.
4.

Reviewing the current legal , institutional and regulatory framework
Examination of past and ongoing PPP experiences in Seychelles
Assessment of Government agencies capacities to develop and implement PPP projects
Identification of potential sectors for PPP in Seychelles

Following the needs assessment, a policy has been drafted by the consultant, reviewed by the
Government, and discussed by relevant stakeholders in the economy through a validation workshop
on the 15th of April. The final national PPP policy is expected to be submitted to cabinet for approval
in Q2 2015. The policy will set clear country definition of PPP, sectoral coverage as well as clear
guidelines and principles for the implementation of PPP projects in Seychelles. The next phase is the
development of the PPP Legal, Regulatory and Operational framework with technical assistance from
AFDB.
V. State-owned Enterprise Reform and Performance
25.
To strengthen the overall corporate governance, the Public Enterprise Monitoring
Commission (PEMC) will undertake the task of developing a Code of Governance to be adopted
by Public Enterprises upon approval of the Cabinet. To facilitate Board nomination process on PE
boards, the Commission shall initiate the creation of an Institute of Directors as well as providing
training for Board appointees. The Commission with the assistance of the World Bank shall also
conduct governance reviews and operational/business assessments on the Public Enterprises (three
by end-June, 2016, revised SB).
26.
For effective government oversight and to enhance accountability a State Ownership Policy
separating the state’s ownership function from its policy and regulatory functions will be developed
which would further enhance the Commission’s monitoring role. The government intends to
strengthen the supervision of SOEs investments. To that end, the government proposes that the
Development Committee that was established to approve all investments above SR10M in the Public
Sector Investment Program, be tasked by the Société Seychelloise d’Investissement to review all
investments of SOEs above the same threshold. A cabinet paper on strengthening SOE oversight (SB,
end-May) has been approved on the 6th of May 2015.
27.
Comprehensive asset registers for five state owned enterprises were published via the PEMC
website (SB for End December 2014) and the Commission intends to publish the asset register for
the remaining Public Enterprises in an effort to ensure transparency.
28.
The operational performance of SEYPEC and PUC improved in 2014. Air Seychelles recorded
operational losses in 2014, which were offset by contributions previously committed by the
government of Seychelles, and by its other shareholders Etihad as part of Air Seychelles’
restructuring program. SEYPEC tankers’ business recorded a modest loss after loan repayment, much
lower than in 2013, and could break even in 2015, resulting in overall profitability for the company.
PUC benefits from a decline in the cost of fuel oil, which it will pass on to the consumer in April. Air
Seychelles recorded significant losses on its European route, via Abu Dhabi, because of very modest
load factor, which were not offset by profits on its regional network. It has announced the
introduction of a direct route to Europe from July 1, codeshared with Air France, the success of which
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 67

SEYCHELLES

will depend on the ability of attracting a high load factor. The route is highly welcome by the hotel
operators. The government is considering the possibility to extend a time bound and limited
contribution to the company for a limited time period, to support the marketing of this route in the
initial phase of operation of the new route. The precise amount of this marketing support will be
defined in the coming months, but will be incorporated within the existing fiscal balances, and will be
dependent on the company achieving key milestones. The marketing effort of the new route will also
be supported by the Seychelles Tourism Board. The company has redesigned its regional network in
December 2014, with the aim to attract new regional customers to channel to its direct route to
India. It has intensified the monitoring of operating results by individual routes, and strengthening
the reporting of operation of results to PEMC.
29.
The SSI has been established to guide the strategy and oversees the performance and
objectives of all government owned commercial parastatals. It can serve as an investment vehicle for
the government in key strategic sectors and also operates as a government holding company for all
commercial ventures. To improve the governance of SSI and its supervisory role, the participation in
the board of any CEO will be phased out. The government is committed to ensure that the dividends
paid by the SOEs accrued to the State budget, and they are not diverted for investment purposes.
Any new investments will have to be based on a clear justification for government intervention. To
strengthen the effectiveness of SSI in supervising major investments by SOEs, the SSI will use the
services of the Development Committee as specified above. The government is drawing on advice
from the World Bank, IMF, and other development partners to define SSI’s mandate consistent with
these principles.
VI. Promoting growth and private sector development
30.
The government is committed to promote competition and increased private sector
involvement in key sectors, including infrastructure, fisheries and port services. Regarding the
development of the Port of Victoria, which plays a key role in economic activity, the government has
taken the decision to build a new quay for use by commercial fishing activity on the basis of a public
private partnership with a private operator. To that purpose a joint venture was established, with
government 40 percent share which will be in the portfolio of SSI. The private partners are providing
most of the funds for the building of the quay. As far as current operation of the Port are concerned,
the government has benefited from an IFC report examining the options regarding the existing
concession agreement with Land Marine, that runs up to 2022, and which currently gives an exclusive
right to that company to run port services. The government is reviewing the different options on
renegotiation of terms of the concession, to open up more services to competition, and plan to
present them to Cabinet before end of May 2015 (SB).
31.
The government will also facilitate title registration, by adopting an automated system, in
order to speed up the provision of housing financing by financial institutions.
32.
The EITI Board admitted Seychelles as an EITI Candidate country on the 6th August
2014. In accordance with the EITI Standard, Seychelles is required to publish its first EITI Report
within 18 months after being accepted as Candidate Country (6th February 2016).

68 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SEYCHELLES

VII. Public Debt Management Strategy
33.
Seychelles is on track with its strategy of reducing public debt to sustainable levels.
With the strong fiscal performance and GDP growth forecast in the medium term, public debt is
expected to be reduced below 50 percent of GDP in 2018. The aim is to continue with the
borrowings on favourable terms and gradually extend maturities of the debt portfolio. Medium term
Treasury bonds issued locally in 2014 for a total amount of SR813 million were fully subscribed and
most external borrowings have been from multilaterals. With debt service set to rise sharply in the
near term as grace periods on principal come to an end, it will create increased pressures on the
external accounts. Consequently, one of the key debt management goals is to smooth out the
external debt service profile and shift public borrowing to local currency wherever possible. It is with
these objectives in mind that we are implementing a partial swap/buyback of Paris Club debt
maturities at a fair market price.
34.
On 25th February 2015, Paris Club creditors with the participation of South Africa
agreed to an early repayment scheme for the debts of Seychelles rescheduled by the Paris Club
in 2009, in support of marine conservation efforts. Under the partial buyback agreement, an
amount of US$30 million will be transferred in terms of a fund for the protection and development of
the marine space of Seychelles. The transaction will enable Seychelles to buy back a portion of the
debt maturities falling due to the Paris Club between 2015 and 2021 at a 5 percent discount to face
value. The debt to be bought back will be converted into new Government of Seychelles debt
obligations, which will be partly repaid in local currency, to be issued to the Seychelles Conservation
and Climate Adaptation Trust (SCCAT) – the local trust created to fund and manage the marine
conservation.
VIII. Foreign Trade Regime
35.
In December 2014 the General Council of WTO approved Seychelles’ Accession Package. The
Package has been presented to the Seychelles National Assembly in the third week of March 2015
for ratification. On the 24th of March 2015, the National Assembly unanimously enacted into law the
Protocol on the accession for Seychelles to the WTO. Following the Act of Parliament, His Excellency,
President James Michel signed the Instrument of Acceptance of the Protocol of Accession of the
Republic of Seychelles at a plenary meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers on the 25th March 2015 and
subsequently deposited to the WTO Director General. On the 26th April, Seychelles became the
161st Member of the WTO.
36.
In March 2015 the National Assembly ratified Seychelles’ accession to the SADC Trade
Protocol. Upon gazettal of the SADC FTA Regulations under the Customs Management Act, 2011,
Seychelles shall also become a member of the SADC FTA.
IX. Monetary, Exchange Rate, and Financial Sector Policies
37.
The quarterly average value of reserve money will continue to serve as the nominal
anchor in monetary policy implementation. Under the current flexible monetary policy framework,
there is an important focus on short-term liquidity conditions as CBS lays the foundation to move
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 69

SEYCHELLES

towards a more forward-looking framework. The interest rate corridor has been introduced so that
more guidance is provided to the market and to allow commercial banks to improve liquidity
management whilst also strengthening interest rate transmission. To improve monetary policy
analysis and forecasting, which will eventually further strengthen the monetary policy framework,
CBS has requested technical assistance from the IMF.
38.
As per the Memorandum of Understanding between the Ministry of Finance and the
Central Bank of Seychelles, the Ministry will continue to issue T-Bills and T-Bonds for
monetary policy purposes. To that end, the Ministry has agreed to issue government securities as
needed during 2015 in support of monetary policy.
39.
CBS is to maintain a tight monetary policy stance as long as necessary to mitigate
possible inflationary pressures and support external balance. The data from the recently revised
CPI basket for January 2015 suggest some inflationary risks starting 2015. In addition, growth in
credit to the private sector remained strong in recent months. We aim to bring such growth down
over the full year 2015 to a level that is more sustainable over the medium-term. Inflationary
pressures are expected to be dampened by the recent appreciation of the domestic currency and by
the fall in key prices such as fuel and utility, reflecting the recent fall in oil and commodity prices
internationally. Monetary policy will be relaxed once inflation starts to recede, which is forecasted to
happen in the second half of 2015. CBS stands ready to adjust policy as circumstances require.
40.
The Bank is committed to a floating exchange rate regime. Following a sharp
depreciation in the second half of 2014 during which the market gradually cleared the existed
backlogs in meeting demand for foreign exchange, the rupee has been trading in a relatively narrow
range against its main counterpart but remains vulnerable to excess demand, a weakened Euro and
downside risk emanating from the Euro area. On a positive note, lower energy and commodity prices
are expected to dampen the value of imports and reduce potential demand pressure on the
domestic currency. The exchange rate flexibility will ensure adjustments are in line with economic
fundamentals. The Bank remains vigilant and ready to take necessary measures to ensure orderly
conduct in the foreign exchange market and hence will only intervene in the event of excessive
volatility.
41.
In order to build further resilience against external shocks, reserves accumulation
remains an important objective of the authorities. During 2015, CBS is to accumulate
international reserves through opportunistic purchases from the market without influencing the
exchange rate. We will seek to exceed our reserves targets if conditions allow.
42.
The Bank remains committed to improve its reserves management capacity during the
year. In December 2014 the Board approved the engagement on the Reserves Advisory and
Management Programme (RAMP) with the World Bank. Moreover, in the first quarter of 2015, staff
concerned with reserves management intends to complete the first part of a training provided by
Crown Agents Investment Management (CAIM), which is offered as part of the external investment
management agreement.

70 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SEYCHELLES

X. Financial Sector Development and Stability
43.
A strong macro prudential policy framework is important to continue to safeguard the
financial sector. In this regard CBS will implement a Financial Stability Framework with the
establishment of Financial Stability Committee (FSC). The FSC will have the primary responsibility of
taking action to reduce systemic risks and enhancing the resilience of the Seychelles financial system.
It will have a secondary objective to support the economic policy of the Government and could issue
guidance on on-going surveillance, diagnostic assessment and policy actions. The basic elements of
the framework will be set up by October 2015. In particular, the CBS will establish a macroprudential
unit within the Financial Services Supervision Division (FSSD) and achieve Board approval for the set
of macroprudential policies and measures that can be implemented under the existing legal
framework. In addition this will involve the setting up of a Financial Stability Committee under the
Chairmanship of the Central Bank.
44.
With the aim that financial services be used more effectively and in responsible and
sustainable manner the CBS will enhance its mandate for consumer protection and develop a
strategy for financial literacy. With Technical assistance from World Bank, the options for
establishing a financial ombudsman function in Seychelles with adequate enforcement powers will
be explored based on international experience and trends. CBS will also be the focal point for
financial literacy in Seychelles. As a first step, a financial literacy baseline study will be commissioned
to identify the target groups and design a comprehensive and cost effective strategy and
implementation plan for reaching them.
45.
CBS will continue to pursue its effort to upgrade banking regulations. In this regards a
complete review of the Financial Institutions Act will be effected. This will cater for implementation of
Basel 2 and 3 as per the revised road map (proposed to push to 2017) prepared with assistance of the
IMF TA. Moreover, drawing on recent experiences with CBS’ bank intervention, an enhanced
resolution framework for banks will be developed to ensure that it is in line with new developments
both domestically and internationally. TA from the IMF has been requested to implement such.
46.
In line with emerging risk from the offshore sector CBS and other authorities such as
the Financial Intelligence Unit and Financial Services Authority will strengthen the regulation
of the offshore sector. Consistent with new developments in AML regulatory framework
internationally, Seychelles authorities will take necessary steps to ensure that the industry and local
regulatory standard are in line with the above. The CBS will undertake joint inspections with the FIU.
Moreover, the regulation of the ‘offshore banking’ sector will be enhanced to ensure that any
contagion effect emanating from the offshore is mitigated. In this regards CBS is currently receiving
TA from the IMF.
47.
With regard to the CBS’ Credit Information System (CIS), significant reforms will be
undertaken to increase its usefulness for lenders. The CBS will enhance the overall scope of the
CIS by including credit data from all relevant lenders, including those that do not fall under its
regulatory purview, and eventually other types of data providers such as utilities companies. The
frequency and type of data that is collected by the CIS and the information that is distributed back to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 71

SEYCHELLES

lenders will be improved. In the medium term, another structural improvement will be a more
comprehensive legal and regulatory framework for credit reporting activities in Seychelles.
48.
Work on a modern payment system continues. Following the successful implementation
of the first phase of the Seychelles Electronic Funds Transfer (SEFT) project across all banks in midAugust 2013, the second phase of the project currently under implementation since July 2014 is
progressing well, with a new scheduled date of completion set for June 2016. Since the launch of
phase one, the majority of participants have now integrated their CORE banking systems to SEFT to
allow for straight through processing of incoming and outgoing payments and CBS is continuing its
efforts to encourage other participants to follow suit prior to the launch of the second phase. This
second phase of the SEFT project will further modernise and increase the efficiency of the country’s
payments systems by extending the new internet based online platform from the banks domain to
the general public.
49.
CBS remains committed in its endeavour to modernize the country’s national payment
system. Work is ongoing to formalize the Terms of Reference for the National Payments Task Force
and the National Payments Committee which amongst others provides for a regular schedule of
meetings and sets out the objectives of the two forums which are key drivers in the modernization
process. Moreover, the bank in collaboration with other stakeholders, is working on a new vision and
strategy for modernization of the national payment system covering the period from 2015 to 2018.
The CBS is also engaging the assistance of AfDB for external consultants to undertake a feasibility
study in 2015 and subsequently, assist with the introduction of a Central Securities Depository (CSD)
as well as a Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS).
50.
The regulatory framework for oversight of payment systems in Seychelles is being
enhanced. With the creation of a new division within CBS in 2014 to regulate payment systems in
Seychelles, the CBS has issued the National Payment Systems Act in August 2014 and the Licensing
and Authorisation Regulations in December the same year. It is further expected that Regulations on
the continuous oversight of payment systems will be issued in 2015 with the help of Technical
Assistance being received from the World Bank. In regards to alignment with international standards,
work has commenced with the aid of technical assistance from the IMF in order to assess the
national payment system’s compliance with the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures in April
2015.
XI. Financial Services Authority and Non-Bank Financial Services Sector
51.
The work of the Global Forum on transparency and exchange of information in tax matters
remains priority of the FSA for the coming years. In order to satisfy the recommendations made by
the Global Forum in the Seychelles’ report on the effectiveness of sanctions and monitoring of the
availability of ownership and accounting information, new obligations have been imposed on
International Corporate Service Providers (ICSPs) to monitor compliance by specified entities and
foundations under their administration, with certain record-keeping requirements (e.g. ownership
registers, directorship registers and annual returns) and report any non-compliance to the FSA. The
FSA completed its focused onsite inspections on all ICSPs in April 2015 and is currently using a riskbased approach to rank the ICSPs accordingly in terms of risk levels.
72 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

52.
The new IBC law is undergoing final industry consultation and is expected to be submitted to
the National Assembly by the end of June 2015. A new piece of legislation, Global Corporations, to
replace the Companies (Special Licence) Act is also undergoing industry consultation and is expected
to be enacted by September 2015. A new International Corporate Service Providers Act and Trusts
Act is expected to be submitted to National Assembly by December 2015 (new SB). The Seychelles
Gambling Act has been enacted in January this year and the FSA will be administering this piece of
legislation, mainly the regulation of casinos, slot machines and online gambling. However, this Act is
expected to be operational in the last quarter of 2015 which will allow the FSA to build capacity and
allow sufficient time for existing licensees to comply with the requirements of the new law when the
latter becomes operational. In order to strengthen the regulation of insurance and pensions sector,
ADB through ICF will be providing technical assistance to the FSA in the form of capacity support. In
addition, the FSA will also be seeking technical assistance from the IMF or World Bank to review the
existing laws on Insurance, Securities, and Mutual and Hedge Funds in order to identify gaps or
weakness in these laws and bring them in line with international standards and best practices.
XII. Implementation of the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters
53.
The Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters is a multilateral
agreement, developed jointly by the OECD and the Council of Europe in 1988, to promote
international co-operation for a better operation of national tax laws and has the ultimate goal of
combating tax avoidance and evasion. 84 countries so far have signed the Convention and is open
for signatures. The aim of this Convention is to enable the Seychelles Revenue Commission (SRC) to
engage in exchange of information, assistance in recovery of tax, and service of documents to the tax
authorities of other signatory countries.
54.
At its sixth meeting in Jakarta on 21st to 22nd November 2013, the Global Forum on
Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes (the “Global Forum”) published
Seychelles’ ratings on the level of compliance with the internationally agreed standard for exchange
of information in tax matters. Seychelles alongside three other countries was assigned the overall
rating “non-compliant”. The ratings for the element C.2 (amongst ten other elements) relating to
Exchange-of-information mechanisms with all relevant partners, was deemed Partially Compliant, as
it was seen that Seychelles was not encouraging tax information exchange agreements. To this effect
and upon acquiring Cabinet approval (Cabinet Minutes Ref No. C13/M21), on 30th October 2013, the
Government of Seychelles on 22nd November 2013, in Jakarta, signed a letter of intent expressing
Seychelles’ commitment to become party to the OECD Multilateral Convention on Mutual
Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters. For the Agreement to be signed, however, it was required
that an amendment be made to the Seychelles Revenue Commission Act to satisfy that all
information received under the terms on the Convention, will be treated with high confidentiality.
On 19th January 2015, the mentioned Amendment was gazetted and on 24th February 2015, the
Convention was signed. Following submission by the government, the National Assembly ratified the
SRC Act amendments and the Convention on 14th April, 2015. Signing and ratifying this Convention
complements Element C of our Peer Review so that it could be utilised to trigger Seychelles’
supplementary review and subsequently bring Seychelles to a compliance status.

XIII. National Statistics
SDDS Subscription
55.
An SDDS assessment mission by the IMF was undertaken in early February 2015. Individual
meetings were held with the agencies for the respective sectors namely NBS (Real Sector), Ministry of
Finance, Trade and the Blue Economy (Fiscal Sector), Central Bank of Seychelles (Financial and
External Sectors). A template has been agreed upon and finalised for the SDDS National Summary
Data Page (NSDP) and the Advance Release Calendar (ARC). These have been populated with data
for the relevant periods and uploaded on the NBS website.
56.
The link to the populated template was submitted to the IMF at the end of February as per
agreed actions and timelines. The template is being further polished to include relevant hyperlinks
for more detailed access by users to underlying data and will be updated periodically in line with the
ARC dates.
57.
Based on the assessment and discussions between the IMF and all national agencies at the
end of the mission, an agreement was reached that Seychelles could graduate to the SDDS at the
end of April 2015, a couple of months earlier than the initially agreed upon time frame. On account
of our discipline and performance, we officially graduated to the SDDS starting on May 1st, 2015.
Major recommendations include:


Monthly compilation of the Industrial Production Index (IPI) and the Producer Price Index
(PPI). These are currently being compiled and published on a quarterly basis through the use
of a flexibility option on both frequency and timeliness



Incorporation of offshore activities in the BOP, IIP and external debt position of the country



Creation of a website for the MFT&BE



Reviewing all metadata and submission of the same to the IMF by end of March 2015

2013 Household Budget Survey (HBS)
58.
The results of the 2013 HBS have been incorporated in the compilation of the monthly CPI as
from January 2015. This includes new basket and weights.
59.
Work has also started to use 2013 HBS results to compile Household Final Consumption
Expenditure (HFCE) as part of our short to medium term objective of compiling GDP using the
expenditure approach GDP (E), in addition to the production approach. This is being done with the
assistance of the NA expert from the IMF-AFRITAC South institute.
60.
The data from the 2013 HBS will also be further exploited and used to calculate a poverty
line. This poverty study is being supported by the World Bank through technical assistance missions

and will include training in the use of the ADEPT software. This project is planned to take place in
April and May 2015 and the Agency for Social Protection (ASP) is expected to participate in this
exercise.

Attachment 2: Technical Memorandum of Understanding
1.
This technical memorandum of understanding presents the definitions of variables included
in the quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets set out in the letter of intent (LOI), the
key assumptions, and the reporting requirements of the Government and the Central Bank of
Seychelles (CBS) needed to adequately monitor economic and financial developments. The
quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets, and the benchmarks for 2015 are listed in
Tables 1 and 2 attached to the MEFP, respectively.
I. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
A. Net International Reserves of the CBS (Floor)
DEFINITION
2.
Net international reserves (NIR) of the CBS are defined for program monitoring purposes as
reserve assets of the CBS, minus reserve liabilities of the CBS (including liabilities to the IMF). Reserve
assets of the CBS are claims on nonresidents that are readily available (i.e., liquid and marketable
assets, free of any pledges or encumberments and excluding project balances and blocked or escrow
accounts, and bank reserves in foreign currency maintained for the purpose of meeting the reserve
requirements), controlled by the CBS, and held for the purpose of intervening in foreign exchange
markets. They include holdings of SDRs, holdings of foreign exchange, demand and short-term
deposits at foreign banks abroad, fixed-term deposits abroad that can be liquidated without penalty,
and any holdings of investment-grade securities. Reserve liabilities of the CBS comprise liabilities to
nonresidents contracted by the CBS, any net off-balance-sheet position of the CBS (futures, forwards,
swaps, or options) with either residents or nonresidents, including those to the IMF.
Calculation method
3.
For program monitoring purposes, reserves assets and liabilities at each test date must be
converted into U.S. dollars using the end of period exchange rates assumed in the program.
Monitoring and reporting
4.
Semiannually, at each test date for program performance criteria, the net international
reserves data submitted by the CBS to the IMF will be audited by the CBS’ internal audit division in
accordance with International Standards on Auditing, to ensure conformity with the program
definition and calculation methods. Reports will be submitted to the IMF no later than two months
after each test date.
Adjusters
5.
The floor on the CBS’s NIR will be adjusted upward (downward) by the amount by which the
external non-project loans and non-project cash grants exceeds (falls short of) the amounts assumed
in the program (LOI Table 1). The floors will also be adjusted upwards (downwards) by the amount
that external debt service payments fall short (exceed) the amounts assumed in the program.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 79

SEYCHELLES

B. Reserve Money and Reserve Money Band (Ceiling)
Definition
6.
Reserve money is equivalent to currency issued and deposits held by other depository
corporations at the central bank (bank reserves), including those denominated in foreign currencies.
The reserve money targets are the projected daily averages of the quarter preceding the test date,
surrounded by a symmetrical band of three percent in both directions. The upper bound of the band
serves as performance criterion or indicative target (ceiling). Quarterly average reserve money will be
calculated as the arithmetic average of reserve money observed on all days over the quarter. The
resulting value will be compared with the program ceiling.
Monitoring and reporting
7.
Daily reserve money data will be submitted by the CBS to the IMF on a weekly basis with a
time lag no later than one week. The cumulative average over the quarter will also be monitored by
the CBS and reported to the IMF on a weekly basis.
C. Program Primary Balance of the Consolidated Government (Cumulative Floor)
8.
The program consolidated government primary balance from above the line on a
commitment basis is defined as total consolidated government and social security fund revenues
(excluding privatization and long-term lease income receipts) less all noninterest (primary)
expenditures and net lending of the government and social security fund. For program purposes the
transfer of assets from the Social Security Fund to the Seychelles Pension Fund planned for 2015 will
be excluded from expenditures.
D. Public External Debt (Ceiling)
9.
The ceiling applies to the contracting or guaranteeing of new external liabilities by the public
sector (including the central government, the CBS, and all public agencies and parastatals for
operations that are not directly linked to commercial activities). The ceiling does not apply to the use
of Fund resources, operations related to external debt restructuring; normal import related credits;
purchases of treasury securities by nonresidents; or borrowing by parastatals in the conduct of
normal commercial operations. The non-zero ceilings on the contracting or guaranteeing of external
debt are to allow for normal public project finance and program support from multilateral
institutions exclusively. Debt shall be valued in U.S. dollars at program exchange rates. A zero subceiling on short-term external debt applies to the contracting or guaranteeing of short-term external
debt by the public sector, with an original maturity of up to and including one year. External debt is
defined on a residency basis.
10.
For the purposes of this performance criterion, the definition of debt is set out in Point 9 of
the “Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to External Debt in Fund Arrangements,”
attached to Executive Board Decision No. 6230-(79/140), as amended. Debt is understood to mean a
current, non contingent liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of
value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make
one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some future points in

80 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SEYCHELLES

time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the
contract. The ceiling on contracting official and officially guaranteed external debt includes all form
of debt, including:
a. loans, that is, advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of an
undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits, bonds,
debentures, commercial loans, and buyers credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that
are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is required to repay the
funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future
(such as repurchase agreements and official swap arrangements);
b. suppliers credits, that is, contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payments
until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered or services are provided; and,
c.

leases, that is, arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has the right
to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the total
expected service life of the property, while the leasor retains title to the property. The debt is
the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made
during the period of the agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation,
repair, or maintenance of the property;

d. arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment
under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on
an obligation that is not considered debt under this definition (e.g. payment on delivery) will
not give rise to debt.
E. External Arrears of the Public Sector
11.
The nonaccumulation of arrears to external creditors will be a continuous performance
criterion under the program. External payments arrears for program monitoring purposes are
defined as the amount of external debt service due and not paid within the contractually agreed
period, subject to any applicable grace period, including contractual and late interest. Arrears
resulting from the nonpayment of debt service for which a clearance framework has been agreed or
a rescheduling agreement is sought are excluded from this definition.
F. Domestic Arrears of Government
12.
The nonaccumulation of budget expenditure arrears will be a performance criterion under
the program and will be measured on net basis from the beginning of a calendar year. Budget
expenditure arrears are defined as the sum of (1) any invoice that has been received by a spending
agency from a supplier of goods, services, and capital goods delivered and verified, and for which
payment has not been made within the contractually agreed period, or in the absence of a grace
period, within 30 days; (2) unpaid wages, pensions, or transfers, pending for longer than 30 days to
domestic or foreign residents, irrespective of the currency denomination of the debt; and (3) debt
service payment on domestic debt of the government or guaranteed by the government that has not
been made within the contractually agreed period.

Implementation of HIPC Initiative: Not applicable
Safeguards Assessments:
The Central Bank of Seychelles (CBS) was subject to a safeguards assessment with respect to the Stand-By
Arrangement for Seychelles. The original assessment completed in 2008 found high risks in all areas of
the CBS’s safeguards framework, and several measures were included in the program. Two updated
assessments related to the Extended Fund Facility (completed in July 2010 and in October 2013) found
significant improvements and that the authorities had implemented most of the measures recommended
in earlier assessments. In particular, the governance structure at the CBS has been strengthened, and

84

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SEYCHELLES

accountability and transparency continue to be robust. The 2014 follow up safeguards mission assessed
that the safeguards are broadly adequate. Areas for further development include the bank’s legal
framework and internal audit procedures and capacity.
Exchange Rate Arrangement:
The exchange market was liberalized in November 2008, which resulted in the elimination of all
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions that are
subject to Fund approval under Article VIII Sections 2, 3, and 4. The de jure exchange rate regime is
floating.

From mid-March 2013 to end-March 2014, the rupee depreciated within a 2 percent band against the U.S. dollar.
Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified from floating to crawl-like, effective March 12,
2013. Since end-March 2014, the exchange rate has departed from the 2 percent band. Accordingly, the de facto
exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to a floating arrangement, effective March 27, 2014.

RELATIONS WITH THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
GROUP
The Bank commenced operations in Seychelles in 1978 and has since approved 31 operations,
comprising 13 projects, 3 lines of credit and 1 partial credit guarantee as well as numerous studies,
capacity building, technical assistance and emergency relief operations (14 in total). The cumulative value
of approvals, net of cancellations, as at March 2015 was UA 110.56 million, of which 80.8% from the ADB,
7.6% from the ADF, 9.7% from the NTF, and the remaining 1.9% from the AWF and the Fund for Africa
Private Sector Assistance (FAPA).
The current Country Strategy Paper (CSP) covers the period 2011–15 and focuses on one pillar of
support, “Strengthening Private Sector Development and Competitiveness”, which is divided into three
complementary sub-pillars; infrastructure development, enabling financing and regulatory environment,
and human capacity development. Following the Mid- Term Review of the Strategy in 2013, the areas of
support were expanded to also include public financial management.
The total number of approvals under the CSP 2011-15 is expected to reach 13 operations, with total
commitments amounting to UA 46.43 million (USS$64.23 million).
The lending program under the 2011-2015 CSP included UA 20million (US$30million) towards budget
support operations focused on economic competitiveness and public finance management reforms - an
operation of US$20million for 2013-2014, The Inclusive Private Sector Development and Competitiveness
Programme, was prepared and disbursed across two tranches in December 2013 and December 2014,
against satisfactory fulfillment of conditions of disbursement. Phase two of this operation, for an amount
of US$10 million, is being prepared for approval in July 2015 and disbursement by end December 2015.
The operation targets reforms aimed at improving the investment climate, through an improved legal
framework and systems for business facilitation; initiatives to increase access to credit for MSMEs; and an
improved regulatory framework for non-banking financial sector. The operation also targets reforms
aimed at enhancing public sector efficiency, including through the establishment of a regulatory
framework for PPPs and improved transparency and participation in procurement and budget processes.
In addition to the budget support operations, the Bank supported the Seychelles East Africa Submarine
(SEAS) cable ICT PPP project, amounting to US$39 million, of which the Bank financed US$12million,
which was successfully implemented and completed in 2012. The most recent project approval by the
Bank, on 1 April 2015, was for a US$20.6 million loan in support of the Mahe Sustainable Water
Augmentation Project (MSWAP).
The on-going non-lending program includes two new technical assistance packages in support of the
reforms targeted by the budget support operation, including support to Private Sector Development,
particularly access to finance and skills development for small and medium enterprises, valued at
approximately US$1.5million, as well as a project provided jointly with the Investment Climate Facility in
support of PPP legal, regulatory and operational framework, for approximately US$740,000. The Bank is
also preparing a Technical Assistance package to support the implementation of the Financial Sector
Development Implementation Plan for approval this year.

SEYCHELLES

The AfDB is currently preparing the next Country Strategy Paper for Seychelles. The proposed
overarching objective of the Bank’s new CSP for Seychelles 2016-20 is to accelerate diversified economic
growth by focusing on the private sector as the main engine of inclusive and green growth and
employment creation. Two main pillars of support are being proposed, Pillar 1 – “Strengthening energy
infrastructure to support green and inclusive growth” and Pillar 2 – “Promoting private and
financial sector development to support economic diversification”.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
SEYCHELLES—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
As of January 5, 2015

I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but it is broadly adequate for surveillance. The country
participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since December 2006 and in government
finance statistics modules of the Anglophone Africa project funded by the U.K. Department for
International Development (DFID). Good progress has been achieved in improving statistical capacity,
though sustained technical assistance and additional resources will be required for statistical
development over the medium term in order to improve the quality of economic statistics. Having met all
Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) requirements and following review of metadata by the IMF
Statistics Department, Seychelles subscribed to the SDDS on May 1, 2015.

National accounts: National accounts data are prepared on a calendar-year basis with 2006 serving as
the base year for constant price measures. The NSB has developed quarterly national accounts data for
the period 2006-14. Further technical assistance is being provided to allow for a rebasing of the national
accounts to 2013 (reflecting the results of the new Household Budget Survey), compilation of the
quarterly national accounts using the expenditure approach, and production of seasonally-adjusted
quarterly GDP figures. Tourism statistics are compiled on a weekly and monthly basis. Production
indicators are compiled quarterly, and both are reported to the IMF in a timely manner. Data on average
earnings and employment by sector are collected on a quarterly basis by the NSB, but there are no data
on unit labor costs.

Price statistics: A new consumer price index (CPI) was introduced in January 2015 based on expenditure
weights derived from the 2013 household budget survey.

Government finance statistics: Seychelles reports to STA the cash flow statements and financial
balance sheet data based on the Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM 2001). Main
recommendations of the 2011 GFS mission were: (i) establish a GFS task force among Treasury, Financial
Planning and Control Division (FPC), Debt Management staff, and other relevant agencies to discuss and
resolve technical and methodological issues; (ii) establish a strategic plan that specifies how to address
weaknesses in terms of: (1) augmenting the cash recording of transactions in the execution of the budget
with relevant accrual-based measures; (2) improving data on other economic flows for financial assets
and liabilities; and, (3) addressing the lack of stock data on government holdings of nonfinancial assets,
beginning with fixed assets and non-produced assets (lands). While substantial progress has been made,
further work will be needed to support a full move to GFSM 2001.

Monetary and financial statistics: Monetary and financial sector data are reported regularly to STA for
publication in the IFS. The analytical framework underlying the compilation of monetary statistics is
generally sound. An integrated monetary database has been developed and is fully operational using the
standardized report forms (SRF) for reporting monetary data to the Fund. The SRF-based monetary data
have been published in the IFS Supplement since its March 2007 issue.

Financial sector surveillance: The authorities are compiling financial soundness indicators and report
them to the Fund on a monthly basis. Work is ongoing to establish a macroprudential framework under
the aegis of a financial stability committee, with TA provided by the Fund.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 91

SEYCHELLES

External sector statistics: The authorities have adopted the methodology of the sixth edition of the
Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, and are expected to compiled the
international investment position in 2015 for the first time. Annual balance of payments data are reported
to the Statistics and African Departments nine months after the reference period, but provisional
estimates are provided to missions earlier. Quarterly BOP data have been compiled since 2009, and were
made publicly available and also reported to STA in 2015. Merchandise trade data are reported on a
quarterly basis. Considerable progress has been made in collecting and updating data on public sector
external debt and debt-service and payments of external arrears. Remaining priority areas include
improving the coverage of external sector statistics, and compiling private sector debt data.

II. Data Standards and Quality
No ROSC has been carried out.

Statement by the Staff Representative on Seychelles
Executive Board Meeting
June 17, 2015
1.
Since the issuance of the staff report, the following information has become available.
This information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Macroeconomic outcomes have been somewhat stronger than projected. Tourism
arrivals in the first four months of the year have been 13 percent higher than during the same
period in 2014, driven by the buoyant growth of the Indian market and continued expansion
of the traditional French and Italian markets. With monetary and fiscal policies in line with
program targets, the recovery in tourism, and lower commodity import prices, the balance of
payments has strengthened, with the exchange rate rising to 13.2 SCR/Dollar, a nominal
appreciation of around 6 percent against the dollar since the start of the year. Inflation, which
had reached 5.8 percent in March, fell to 4.0 percent in May, largely as a result of lower fuel
prices feeding through to the electricity tariff.
3.
Program performance appears to be on track to exceed targets. Preliminary data
suggest that the Q1 fiscal primary surplus exceeded the target by around ¾ of a percent of
GDP, supported by strong revenues. The authorities have taken advantage of the improved
external environment to purchase foreign exchange and boost gross international reserves to
$512 million on June 8 (implying NIR of $406 million comfortably above the end-June target
of $367 million). Cumulative quarterly reserve money has stayed within the target corridor
during the second quarter of 2015. Growth of credit to the private sector has begun to
moderate, with annual growth decreasing from 25 percent in December 2014 to 23 percent in
March 2015.
4.
The authorities have also made progress on the structural agenda. On June 3 the
Cabinet approved a strategy aiming to reduce restrictions and encourage competition in the
provision of port services, meeting a structural benchmark with a small delay. Consultations
on new legislation on International Business Companies for submission to the National
Assembly (structural benchmark, end-June) are advancing more slowly than expected, and the
legislation is expected to be submitted in the second half of the year.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SEYCHELLES

Statement by Ms. Plater, Executive Director for Seychelles
and Mr. South, Advisor to Executive Director for Seychelles
June 17, 2015
After experiencing a debt crisis in 2008-09, the very small archipelago state of Seychelles has
pursued ambitious and wide-ranging reforms aimed at stabilizing the economy and reorienting
fiscal and monetary policies to lift and entrench growth. The authorities have made significant
progress in building a resilient and more diversified economy under successive programs
supported by the Extended Fund Facility. Macroeconomic stability has been restored, growth has
returned, inflation has moderated, the exchange rate has stabilized, public debt has declined
sharply, and net international reserves have been steadily accumulated. These outcomes have
been underpinned by the floating of the exchange rate, and tighter monetary and fiscal policies.
However, the authorities are keenly aware that continued efforts are needed. As a very small,
highly open economy that is heavily reliant on tourism and imports, Seychelles remains
particularly vulnerable to external shocks. The authorities continue to focus on strengthening
macroeconomic stability by further reducing public debt from high levels, accumulating
additional international reserves, and pursuing deep structural reforms to promote inclusive
growth.
The authorities remain firmly committed to the program and request the completion of the
second review. The authorities successfully met all but one of their quantitative program targets
for end-December 2014. Importantly, public debt remains on track to fall below 50 percent of
GDP by 2018, which has been a target firmly embedded in the authorities’ reform program since
2008. The targets for the fiscal primary surplus and higher net international reserves were
surpassed comfortably last year, while the reserve money ceiling was exceeded by a very small
margin, which was later corrected. The authorities request a waiver for this minor and temporary
breach. The authorities have made considerable progress on the structural benchmarks, which
remain broadly on track albeit with some delays.
RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
With stronger fundamentals now in place, the Seychellois economy proved better equipped
to deal with external challenges in 2014. Real GDP grew by 3.3 percent in 2014, while the
decline in oil prices contributed to stable inflation outcomes. External pressures heightened
through 2014, with weaknesses in key exports. The economy adjusted successfully, benefitting
from the reforms of recent years. The exchange rate depreciated by 16 percent in the three
months to October 2014 before stabilizing and appreciating by around 6 percent since the start of
this year. The balance of payments pressures abated towards the end of 2014 as a result of
tightened monetary policy, the decline in oil prices and in response to the exchange rate
depreciation. The current account deficit of 21 percent of GDP was lower than projected at the
time of the first review, largely due to lower oil prices. It continues to be financed by strong FDI

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 95

SEYCHELLES

inflows. For 2014, the primary fiscal surplus exceeded program targets, as indirect tax
collections reflected strong import growth and domestic demand. Income tax and business tax
collections fell modestly below initial targets. Non-tax revenues were lower than targeted, as a
result of lower dividends from SOEs. Primary current expenditures were in line with program
targets, while capital expenditure modestly exceeded the target. While expenditure on wages and
salaries increased following the pay increase to civil servants granted at the beginning of 2014,
such expenditure remains relatively low compared to other small island states and the authorities
have maintained appropriate wage restraint more recently.
The outlook for 2015 is positive, though substantial risks remain. In 2015, the authorities
expect real GDP growth to accelerate modestly to 3.5 percent. Inflation is likely to be around 5
percent, with the effect of the depreciation of the exchange rate being partially offset by the
decline in oil prices. The current account deficit is expected to contract to 15 percent of GDP in
2015, again largely reflecting the falling cost of petroleum imports. The US dollar value of
tourism earnings has declined modestly, reflecting the pricing of most hotel tariffs in the
weakening euro. Given the considerable reliance on tourism from Europe, Seychelles remains
vulnerable to the faltering recovery in Europe.
FISCAL AND STRUCTURAL POLICIES
Seychelles is continuing to make good progress in restoring fiscal discipline, reducing
debt, and strengthening public financial management. The 2015 budget aims to achieve a
primary surplus of SR 720 million, equivalent to 3.8 percent of projected GDP. Prudent debt
policy aims to reduce public debt to 63.7 percent of GDP in 2015, and is on track to achieve the
target of 50 percent of GDP by 2018. Considerable progress has been made in implementing
public financial management reforms, including the adoption of a Medium-Term Fiscal
Framework that has anchored Seychelles’ fiscal strategy and the medium-term national
development strategy. However, the authorities are conscious that more remains to be done. A
new PFM action plan for 2015-18 is geared towards improvement in capital project cash and
asset management as well as a further enhanced medium-term budget framework.
The introduction of a VAT and flat-rate personal income tax has yielded sound revenue
collections and the authorities are now focused on improving business tax collections. Tax
collections are relatively high compared with other countries in the region as well as other small
island states. Reforms implemented between 2008 and 2012 improved the efficiency of the tax
system by broadening the base and reducing rates, while maintaining the overall tax burden. The
authorities continue to modernize tax administration and are now focusing on improving
business tax compliance, including by undertaking risk-based audits of 60 large businesses, and
improving the revenue administration’s capacity to analyze transfer pricing arrangements. They
are also focusing on simplifying payment procedures and improving the collection of arrears.
The authorities are focused on ensuring the quality of spending and that ongoing
investments in health, education and social programs support growth prospects and social

96

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SEYCHELLES

outcomes. Seychelles has achieved sound outcomes for its citizens in education, health, poverty
eradication, and the environment. Underpinning these outcomes has been a policy of free access
to healthcare and education. The authorities are taking steps to improve the training of functional
skills, as a means to address the skills shortage and mismatches.
The authorities are continuing to strengthen the accountability, monitoring and control of
SOEs to improve the efficiency of SOEs and reduce fiscal risks. As a microstate of many
small islands, the lack of competition and need for scale in some sectors of the economy call for
a larger role for government. Accordingly, SOEs exist in Seychelles to deliver a range of
essential services in electricity, water, roads, seaports, fuel supply, transport and aviation. The
authorities are mindful of the need for accountability, monitoring and control so that SOEs do
not present undue risks to public finances. In particular, the authorities are placing more
emphasis on applying best practices to SOEs through management and governance audits so as
to further enhance transparency and efficiency in the delivery of public services. The operational
performance of the state-owned petroleum (SEYPEC) and utilities (PUC) companies improved
in 2014. However, Air Seychelles recorded large operational losses, which were offset by
contributions previously committed by the government of Seychelles and by the airline’s other
private shareholder. Air Seychelles has announced the introduction of a direct route to Paris from
1 July 2015, codeshared with Air France, aimed at boosting arrival numbers from this key
market. The government of Seychelles has worked with Air Seychelles to establish a clear plan
to return the airline to profitability, including milestones by which progress will be assessed.
The authorities also recognize that the private sector is the engine of growth and are
committed to ensuring that the operation of SOEs does not obstruct the participation of
private sector in competitive markets. The authorities agree on the need for SOEs to focus on
core mandates in order to minimize risks to the public finances and to allow for the development
of the private sector. Furthermore, recognizing the need for a vibrant and competitive private
sector, the authorities will continue to promote competition in key sectors such as fisheries and
port services. The authorities are pursuing a PPP model for the participation of private investors
in the expansion of the port of Victoria, and are working to appropriately balance the share of
risks and incentives for the private involvement. More generally, the authorities are working with
the African Development Bank and other partners to develop a PPP policy, which would ensure
transparency and accountability in the risks to the public balance sheet.
Seychelles is on track with its strategy of reducing public debt to sustainable levels. The
strong fiscal performance and forecast of GDP growth in the medium term mean that public debt
is expected to fall below 50 percent of GDP in 2018. The authorities aim to place borrowings on
favorable terms and gradually extend maturities of the debt portfolio. With debt service set to
rise sharply in the near term as grace periods come to an end, one of the key debt management
goals is to smooth out the debt service profile and shift borrowings on to local currency wherever
possible. It is with these objectives in mind that the authorities have agreed on a debt
reorganization to smooth and reduce debt service obligations while providing a stream of

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 97

SEYCHELLES

resources to support marine conservation. Under this agreement, Paris Club creditors and South
Africa will receive the immediate repayment of a share of claims, at a moderate discount. The
government of Seychelles benefits from an extended period over which it will make repayments,
which are partially converted into domestic currency. A portion of the repayments will be set
aside for marine conservation activities through a global environmental NGO.
Seychelles continues to deepen its integration with the global economy. Seychelles joined the
WTO in April 2015, an important step given the economy is reliant on open access to trade in
goods and services. The authorities also ratified the Convention on Mutual Administrative
Assistance in Tax Matters, bringing Seychelles into line with existing international standards on
the exchange of tax information. Seychelles has also joined the group of early adopters of the
new global standard to automatically exchange tax information. Seychelles is strongly committed
to transparency through the adoption of internationally accepted best practices in statistics, and
has recently graduated from the GDDS to subscribe to the SDDS. As an EITI Candidate country,
Seychelles will publish its first EITI Report by February 2016.
MONETARY POLICY AND THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
The Central Bank of Seychelles (CBS) intends to maintain a tight monetary policy stance as
long as necessary to guard against possible inflationary pressures and support external
balance. Recent data suggest some emerging inflationary risks and the aim is to moderate the
recent strong growth in private sector credit to more sustainable levels. While the small size of
the foreign exchange market led to some backlogs in the last 12 months, these delays were
short-lived and the CBS remains committed to a floating exchange rate regime to ensure
adjustments reflect economic fundamentals.
In order to build further resilience to external shocks, reserves accumulation remains an
important objective of the authorities. In line with program objectives, the authorities are
targeting a modest increase in net reserves. During 2015, CBS plans to make opportunistic
purchases of international reserves that do not influence the exchange rate. The CBS remains
committed to improve its reserves management capacity with the help of the World Bank.
The CBS continues to move towards a more forward-looking monetary policy framework.
An interest rate corridor is providing guidance to the market and allowing commercial banks to
improve liquidity management while also improving the transmission of monetary policy. The
CBS and the Ministry of Finance have agreed that the Ministry will continue to issue T-Bills and
T-Bonds for monetary policy purposes. The CBS learnt from the experience in late 2014 that led
to the temporary breach of the reserve money ceiling and is receiving technical assistance from
the IMF to further strengthen its liquidity management.
The authorities continue to bring financial regulation into line with evolving international
standards. The CBS continues to upgrade banking regulations to cater for implementation of
Basel II and III standards. Moreover, a new resolution framework for banks will be developed to

98

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SEYCHELLES

ensure that it is in line with new developments, both domestically and internationally. Given
emerging risks from the offshore sector, the authorities are bringing the AML regulatory
framework in line with international standards.
The CBS is also working to draw on recent experience to strengthen the frameworks for
offshore banking supervision and bank resolution. In November 2014, the CBS took over
management control of the Bank of Muscat International Offshore (BMIO), which had lost its
foreign correspondent banking relationship as a result of worldwide de-risking associated with
the increased focus on AML/CFT obligations. By December 2014, the CBS had re-established a
correspondent banking relationship for BMIO. However, given tighter international risk
management requirements, the CBS decided to reorganize BMIO and retained full management
control over BMIO during this process. Despite its operational difficulties, BMIO remained
financially sound throughout and as an offshore bank with funds primarily invested in liquid
securities, there were no significant impacts on the economy.
The authorities agree on the need for a strong macro-prudential policy framework to
continue to safeguard the financial sector. In this regard the CBS is establishing a Financial
Stability Committee that will be responsible for taking action to address systemic financial
system risks. The recent strong private credit growth is expected to moderate to more sustainable
levels following the policy tightening of the CBS. While there are no indications of weakening
lending standards and the recent growth comes after a period where the supply of credit appeared
to be overly restrained, the authorities are closely monitoring these trends.
The CBS is continuing to develop the financial infrastructure, in particular the payments
and credit information systems, and improving access to credit for SMEs and households.
Work on a modern payment system is being accelerated. In 2013, Seychelles implemented a
system for the electronic transfer of funds across all banks. In 2015, a further phase in this
project will extend this online platform from banks to the general public. The CBS is also
focused on enhancing consumer protection and financial literacy.
CONCLUSION
The authorities are very appreciative of the continued close engagement with the IMF, which has
supported the considerable progress they have made in restoring inclusive growth and resilience
to the economy. They wish to thank the Article IV team, led by Mr. Marshall Mills, for the
constructive discussions, analysis and advice. In addition, the IMF’s technical assistance
continues to be highly valuable to the authorities as they make progress on their reform agenda.
