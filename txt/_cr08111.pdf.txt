EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Headwinds from a more testing international environment and domestic political tensions
are challenging Belgium’s enviable economic performance. Economic growth is expected to
decelerate significantly—in the staff’s view to 1.6 percent in 2008, though the authorities
remain somewhat more sanguine. The recent spike in energy and food prices will likely push
average inflation to 2.9 percent in 2008. Partial indexation will temper its impact on real
incomes, but poses risks to competitiveness. With political tensions following the June 2007
elections, federal policy making has been at a standstill since April 2007, delaying much
needed fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. Meanwhile, the window to tackle the
implications of population aging—through fiscal pre-funding and higher growth—is closing
rapidly.
The impact of financial turmoil on the financial system appears contained but, together
with heightened cross-border integration, will continue to require the dedicated attention
of supervisors. While not ruling out downside surprises, especially in the event of a severe and
prolonged economic downturn, supervisors indicated that financial institutions remained
sound. More transparent disclosure of exposures and valuation assumptions and their
implications for banks’ earnings and capital would dampen market volatility. While already
high-quality prudential supervision is being further enhanced, the relentless rise in the crossborder dimension of the financial system requires stronger coordination with host country
authorities.
Though the policy agenda to address aging and fiscal federalism imbalances is well
known, timely delivery is not certain. On the positive side, fiscal consolidation is set to
resume in 2008, without recourse to significant one-off measures. But plans fall short of staff
advice and the urgent reform of fiscal federalism arrangements will need to be executed
without fiscal costs. Greater accountability, more transparency, and stronger coordination
among federal and sub-federal entities are key to achieving the required medium-term buildup
of fiscal surpluses. Structural reforms will need to resume without delay to boost employment
rates and productivity.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
While economic performance has remained good, difficulties in building
consensus for institutional reform have caused an ill-affordable hiatus in economic
policy making. Economic growth was robust in 2007, bringing down unemployment to the
lowest level since 2002. As elsewhere in the euro area, growth is expected to slow
significantly owing to a weakening of the international environment and financial turbulence,
though the domestic financial system appears to be resilient. The recent spike in energy and
food prices is of concern, as partial indexation may pose risks to competitiveness. More
worrisome is the interruption in policy-making at the federal level, broadly since April 2007,
reflecting a complex political environment (Box 1). The coordinated early and decisive
policy response to tackle long-term challenges that Executive Directors called for in last
year’s consultation has thus remained absent.
Box 1. Complex Political Environment
In the June 2007 federal elections, voters rejected the outgoing left-right coalition and put the center
Christian Democrats in a commanding position to form a new coalition, but disagreements on reforms of
fiscal federalism arrangements led to a 6-month political impasse. In the absence of a federal government,
policy making continued only at the regional, community, and local levels but without the usual
coordination mechanisms.
To deal with urgent policy matters, especially the 2008 budget, an interim federal government was formed
on December 21, 2007, under outgoing Prime Minister Verhofstadt. A regular federal government is
expected to be put in place by March 23, 2008, consisting of the same coalition partners but headed by a
new Prime Minister. However, serious tensions remain within the coalition, especially surrounding
constitutional reforms, and the policy

the perspective of the regional

elections of 2009.
Spread 1/
The impact of the political uncertainty
can be seen in movements in sovereign
spreads (Figure 1), with spikes in
political tensions1 leading to their
widening. Indeed, fiscal policy has so
far been the main victim of the
political turmoil: the general
government is likely to record a deficit
of 0.1 percent of GDP in 2007 instead
of the targeted surplus of 0.3 percent
of GDP required under the previously
agreed strategy to deal with aging.

II. OUTLOOK: SUPPORTING GROWTH, MANAGING INFLATION, AND PRESERVING
COMPETITIVENESS
A. How Significant a Slowdown Lies Ahead?
2.
A mostly favorable global
environment and strong domestic demand
delivered robust economic growth in 2007
(Figure 2). The strong performance of
Germany and emerging markets as well as
easy financing conditions created a supportive
external environment during most of the year.
Domestically, household and business
confidence indicators rose significantly,
inflation was subdued, and job creation
increased significantly. All in all, GDP rose
by 2.7 percent in 2007.
3.
Robust economic activity absorbed a
growing labor force and allowed the
unemployment rate to decline
continuously (Figure 3). In addition to
cyclical factors, employment growth also
benefited from a sharp increase in the selfemployed, associated with labor immigration
following EU enlargement, and the
government-subsidized voucher program for
domestic services which led to the creation
of low-skill jobs in the services sector. As a
result, 55,000 jobs were added during the
first 9 months of 2007, raising households’
net disposable income which, in turn,
spurred strong consumption growth.
Meanwhile, labor shortages have started to
appear in some regions and sectors.

The authorities and staff agreed that growth would decline significantly, but
differed on the degree of the slowdown. The authorities’ macroeconomic framework
underlying the budget is based on GDP growth of 1.9 percent in 2008, which they felt was
only slightly on the optimistic side. The staff expects economic growth to fall to 1.6 percent
(Text Table 1). There was agreement that the slowdown would affect all demand
components. Business investment is expected to decelerate due to greater uncertainty and to
a lesser extent because of less favorable financing conditions (Figure 4). Residential

6

construction will ease from historic highs in line with developments in house prices and
mortgage markets (Figure 5).1 Consumption will grow at a lower pace mostly due to sluggish
real disposable income growth as inflation rises and the pace of job creation diminishes.
However, with consumer credit less developed than in Anglo-Saxon countries, the drag from
less favorable financing conditions will be smaller. Finally, the global slowdown and euro
appreciation will dampen export growth.

However, with residential construction only making up 5.7 percent of GDP in 2007, the slowdown in this
sector is not a major factor.

There was agreement that risks were tilted to the downside, but that there was
no need for a policy response beyond the operation of automatic fiscal stabilizers. Oil
prices, the euro appreciation and the duration of the financial turmoil are all weighing on the
downside, while lack of decisive progress with domestic reforms could further sap
confidence (Figure 6). The staff supported the authorities’ intention to allow automatic
stabilizers to operate, thus abandoning the past procyclical practice of targeting nominal
balances. However, the staff cautioned that consolidation would need to resume in earnest
(see Section IV.A.) and that, with widespread indexation practices (see Sections II.B
and II.C), broader fiscal support to the economy could prove counterproductive.

The chart includes the following risks to the baseline projections of growth (2.7 percent in 2007
and 1.6 percent in 2008):
● persistent tightening of financing conditions;
● 10 percent euro appreciation;
● 1 percent drop in foreign demand;
● boost in domestic confidence reflecting steady progress in reform agenda;
● a US recession and a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances.
They are weighted by the staff's subjective probability assessment of their occurrence.

B. How is Inflation Affecting the Economy?

6.
The factors that moderated inflation in the course of 2007 reversed toward the
end of the year. The liberalization of the gas and electricity markets in Brussels and
Wallonia initially reduced the consumer price of energy, exerting a moderating effect on the
HICP until the summer of 2007, and allowing inflation to stay well below the average of the
euro area. However, subsequently, the sharp increase in energy and food prices pushed
inflation up to 3.1 percent in December 2007.

8
7.
Inflation is expected to peak in early 2008 and recede in the course of the year
(Figures 7 and 8). Even though energy and food markets are likely to stabilize, base effects
and increases in the distribution margins in the energy sector in January will keep inflation
high during the first quarter of 2008. Thereafter, inflation is projected to decline gradually to
around 2 percent by year-end, but the year average will register about 2.9 percent.

Low-income groups are being disproportionately affected by the food and
8.
energy price increases, triggering a necessary increase in targeted income support. With
consumption patterns varying according to the income level of the household, a study by the
central bank (NBB) shows that lower-income households suffer greater loss of purchasing
power when these components register above average increases. This was observed between
2004 and 2006 (Text Table 2), and is again applicable since September 2007. Hence, the
authorities have increased the subsidies to low-income households for purchases of heating
oil, through a mechanism that is generally well targeted and whose budgetary implications
are capped.

More general income support measures would not be justified, especially since
existing partial indexation practices already hold up purchasing power. Public and
private sector wages are indexed to a core inflation index, the so-called “health index,”
though some increases are subject to a lower cap. These mechanisms will boost wages by 3
percent in 2008. Even so, against the background of tight labor markets, there are calls for
further wage increases. The mission cautioned against broader wage increases, which would
evoke past episodes of mishandled supply shocks and subsequent painful adjustment. In line
with the tradition of responsible wage bargaining and mindful of the risks to competitiveness,
labor union leaders emphasized the need to stick to existing wage agreements, though they
recognized that recent price increases had raised social tensions. Meanwhile, the authorities
indicated that they had no intention to provide broad income support and would consider the
mission’s advice to seek ways to contain prices by further promoting competition, especially
in the retail sector, and reviewing the distribution margins in the energy sector.
C. Is Competitiveness an Issue?

10.
The authorities agreed that various indicators suggest that the current level of
the real effective exchange rate is broadly appropriate. Export performance remains
relatively robust, with the trend decline in export shares, except for a brief episode in 2006,
fully in line with what is to be expected from the mature structure of the economy. Based on
the CGER methodology, staff estimates of the REER range between a 2 percent
undervaluation (reduced-form estimation) and a 4 percent overvaluation (external
sustainability approach). The former approach evaluates the difference between the current
REER and an equilibrium REER derived from a panel regression in which fundamental
determinants of the REER are evaluated at their trend levels.2 The latter approach verifies
whether on the basis of current trade elasticities, the actual exchange rate is consistent with
maintaining a benchmark level of net foreign assets as a share of GDP, here chosen to be the
2006 level.
Current and trade accounts have been recording a steady surplus. The current
11.
account surplus reflects net savings of the private sector, more than offsetting public sector
deficits. This is driven by high corporate savings, while Ricardian equivalence considerations
have led to a decline in household savings (Text Table 3).3

2

For Belgium, the relevant fundamental variables are: relative productivity, the net foreign asset position, the
terms of trade, and government consumption. For details, see Methodology of CGER Assessments
www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2006/110806.pdf.

3

The government’s fiscal consolidation led individuals to lower their saving rate (see e.g. J. C. Cuaresma, and
G. Reitschuler, 2007, “Is the Ricardian Equivalence Proposition an ‘Aerie Fairy’ Theory for Europe?”
Economica, 74).

Investment in Belgium remains attractive, but the high level of labor costs
12.
underscores the importance of preserving competitiveness through wage moderation.
The authorities have eased business regulation and cut corporate income taxes, thereby
supporting corporate profitability. Moreover, the 2007-08 wage agreements planned to keep
wage growth well below key trading partners. However, higher-than-expected inflation will
trigger wage indexation in 2008 and lift wages above the envisaged path. Hence, labor costs
will evolve in line with partner countries, albeit from a higher starting level. Consequently,
additional wage moderation will be necessary, though the extent of the recent REER
appreciation would be smaller with more up-to-date weights (Figure 9, Text Table 4).
Continuing labor and product market reforms would also help boost productivity
(Section V).

III. FINANCIAL SECTOR: ADDRESSING TURBULENCE AND ENHANCING STABILITY
A. How is the Financial System Coping with Financial Turbulence?

13.
The impact on the financial sector of the ongoing financial turbulence appears
manageable. The balance sheets of the major banks have deteriorated since mid-2007 and
synthetic credit default insurance spreads have risen significantly in response to the global
financial problems (Figure 10). However, strains appear to be smaller than in other major
markets, although they vary from bank to bank. Bank exposure to subprime mortgages is
limited to less than 1 percent of total assets and credit risk stress tests for subprime-related
exposures do not result in a significant impact. Although the size of current financial
vulnerabilities is inevitably subject to much uncertainty and differs by bank, estimated
exposures to asset-backed securities (ABS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDO) also
appear moderate. ABCP conduits sponsored by some of the largest banks have experienced
difficulties in rolling over maturing commercial paper and some banks have brought these
vehicles back on their books, but their size is small compared to the banks’ total on-balance
sheet assets.
Despite some write-offs related to the financial turmoil, supervisors judged the
14.
financial system to have remained sound. Banks remain well capitalized, and solvency and
coverage ratios of insurance companies and pension funds have been increasing.
Participation in ECB liquidity operations does not seem to have been affected by the
financial turmoil, and in response to the stress in financial markets, banks have taken
liquidity-enhancing measures and reinforced contingency funding plans and liquidity

contingency procedures. Moreover, banks’ vulnerability to liquidity shocks is mitigated by
the traditionally large costumer deposit base relative to the loan book, and the presence of a
large securities portfolio, which can be deployed to obtain secured financing in wholesale
markets. Exposure to emerging markets is modest at less than 4 percent of total assets.
Nonetheless, recent volatility in equity prices of financial institutions indicates
15.
the need for more transparent disclosure of exposures and their implications for banks’
earnings and capital. Recent actions taken by some banks to consolidate off-balance sheet
exposures, albeit generally not large, generated unease about banks’ earnings, even while the
adverse impact of the turbulence on profitability and balance sheets of financial institutions
appears manageable. Supervisory authorities agreed that early and clear disclosure of
exposure by financial institutions and their valuation assumptions and methods would help
ease such concerns and were actively encouraging financial institutions to improve
transparency. Nevertheless, valuation remained a difficult task and volatile market conditions
were likely to persist for some time. The authorities also support an international tier to
supervision for regionally and globally systemic institutions and coordinated efforts to
address and prevent further financial turbulence.
B. Will Financial Strains Impact the Real Economy?

16.
Repercussions of the financial turbulence on the real economy have so far been
limited. In contrast to the tightening credit standards in the euro area as a whole, there is no
tightening trend in the lending criteria applied by Belgian banks (Figure 11). Bank credit
demand by non-financial corporate firms increased in late 2007 and was expected to stabilize
in early 2008. Household appetite for credit was robust in late 2007 and anticipated to hold
up in early 2008, despite a slowdown in the mortgage market. At the same time, banks
remained cautious about lending prospects, noting the adverse impact of the financial
turbulence on their balance sheets. The authorities agreed that continued turbulence in
financial markets but, more importantly, a severe and protracted slowdown of economic
activity, could strain the financial sector’s balance sheets, with repercussion for credit
conditions.
The high personal savings ratio and low household leverage provide a buffer to
17.
financial turbulence, but not complete insulation. Gross financial assets of the household
sector amount to over 400 percent of gross disposable income compared to financial
liabilities of around 80 percent, contributing to one of the highest levels of accumulated net
worth in industrialized countries. At the same time, the household sector has sharply
increased its borrowing in recent years, lifted by a buoyant mortgage market. With housing
and equity prices moderating, net wealth creation is expected to slow down. In addition,
households have been increasing their claims on institutional investors, raising the risk
profile of household assets. Hence, while households do not appear overly sensitive to credit

conditions, financial turbulence has raised uncertainty about household real incomes. With
the sensitivity of private consumption to changes in real income comparatively high in
Belgium, a slowdown in private demand is likely.
The deleveraging of the corporate sector has reduced debt-financing risks in the
18.
short term. Profit margins of nonfinancial corporations continued to rise through mid-2007,
allowing internal funds to finance investment. Similarly, with the implementation of the
notional interest rate deduction for corporate equity in 2006, equity financing exploded. The
corporate sector’s healthy balance sheets suggest resilience to a credit squeeze. However, the
financial turbulence-induced slowdown in domestic and global demand is likely to pressure
profit margins and delay investment plans.
C. How Can Financial Stability be Further Enhanced?

19.
Commendable progress has been made in enhancing the effectiveness of the
prudential supervision, helping to safeguard financial stability. In line with the 2005 FSAP
recommendations, the supervisory framework is being continuously upgraded. The
management committee of the Banking, Insurance and Finance Commission (CBFA) has
been streamlined and synergies between the CBFA and the central bank (NBB) have been
further developed. Regular stress tests have helped promote a systematic dialogue between
supervisory authorities and market participants, while a thorough test of detailed procedures
for financial crisis management yielded a satisfactory outcome. Prudential supervision of the
insurance sector has been upgraded and regulation of the pension funds sector reinforced.
At the same time, financial innovations and cross-border consolidation are
20.
modifying the financial landscape considerably. Given the increasing sophistication of
financial instruments and the complexity of bancassurance conglomerates, the authorities are
well aware of the need to remain vigilant and ensure that their capacity to identify risks keep
pace with market developments. To help limit the adverse effects of the ongoing financial
turbulence, they favor more disclosure of exposures, risks, and valuation assumptions and
methodologies. The staff noted that with the cross-border dimension of the financial system
continuing to gain importance, especially following the recent Fortis-ABN AMRO
transaction, deeper coordination with host country authorities will be needed.

16
IV. FISCAL POLICY: RESUMING CONSOLIDATION AND IMPROVING INSTITUTIONS
A. Why has Fiscal Consolidation Become an Urgent Priority?

21.
Fiscal adjustment should be at the core
of a comprehensive strategy to address the
projected rise in aging-related costs. Population
aging will raise public expenditures by close to
6 percentage points of GDP by 2050 (Figure 12).
In the absence of fiscal adjustment, the public
debt-to-GDP ratio is set to move onto an
unsustainable path. There is broad public support
for a significant pre-funding of the rise in agingrelated spending, reflecting concerns about
intergenerational fairness and the need to avoid
activity-discouraging tax increases or drastic
spending cuts in the future. This strategy, as
carefully articulated by the High Finance Council
(HFC), consists of building surpluses gradually and
using the savings from declining public debt to
finance part of the costs of aging (Figure 13).
Durable primary expenditure restraint will be
needed to deliver the required primary surpluses as
Belgium’s revenue-to-GDP ratio—close to
50 percent of GDP—is already very high. Ideally,
spending should be lowered even further to allow a
reduction in the tax burden on labor, which would
help job creation, as would growth-enhancing
policies and entitlement reforms.

Initially planned to begin in 2007, fiscal
22.
consolidation has slipped below the HFC’s
recommended path. The 2007 budget is now estimated to post a small deficit instead of the
planned surplus of 0.3 percent of GDP (Text Table 5). The authorities stressed that fiscal
slippage was mostly due to the hiatus in policy making since April 2007, albeit partly offset
by higher revenue reflecting higher-than-anticipated economic growth. In addition, with the
elimination of one-off measures, fiscal policy was broadly neutral, with the structural balance
remaining close to balance. However, on current policies, the fiscal position is set to
deteriorate, raising concerns about medium and long-term sustainability (Figure 14). In this
context, the authorities recognized that fiscal consolidation is a priority to address the
projected rise in aging-related costs.

confidence in economic policies, especially
important now that other sources of uncertainty cloud the outlook. On the basis of the
authorities’ macroeconomic assumptions, this approach would imply a nominal budget
surplus of nearly 0.2 percent of GDP. The authorities responded they would try to achieve a
small surplus, though this would be difficult, and emphasized that balancing the budget in
nominal terms in 2008 was their minimum objective. At the same time, they conceded that
uncertainty regarding constitutional reform and the political economy of the 2009 regional
elections posed significant risks for fiscal consolidation.
The authorities are focused on using structural measures to deliver the required
24.
consolidation, while avoiding recourse to one-off measures. They agreed that such

18
measures only postponed the needed adjustment and often constitute non-transparent claims
on future resources. For the same reason, staff emphasized that public-private partnerships
should not be used to circumvent fiscal adjustment needs. Risks and future spending
obligations related to such arrangements should be reported in a transparent way.
Delivering the envisaged structural adjustment requires a concerted effort at all
25.
levels of government. The authorities agreed that there is little room for new spending
initiatives or tax cuts, absent compensation elsewhere within the tighter budget envelope,
though various coalitions partners remained to be convinced. At the same time, the high tax
pressure, especially on labor, also rules out further increases in the overall tax burden.
Hence, the adjustment will need to focus on expenditure restraint, for which the following
will be essential:
•

Any savings from a declining interest bill will have to be set aside.

•

Regions and communities will need to contribute more than envisaged in the budgets
adopted for 2008. Sustaining a surplus of at least 0.3 percent of GDP, as was
achieved in 2007, seems feasible (Text Table 6). In the staff’s view, such an objective
is justified because commitments to future spending have increased under publicprivate partnerships, and the resolution of vertical imbalances in the fiscal federalism
arrangements will require a devolution of competencies and associated spending to
the regions without a proportional transfer of revenues. However, some regions
disagree with this approach and seek further transfers from the federal level.

•

The social security surplus should be maintained at its current level (about 0.5 percent
of GDP). The authorities agreed that the rise in health care spending could be kept in
line with trend-GDP growth without compromising the high quality of the health care
system.

•

Similarly, there is scope to slow the pace of spending growth on priority items in the
federal budget compared to existing plans, and curb other discretionary spending,
e.g., by streamlining functions across levels of government, deriving efficiency gains
from upcoming retirements from the civil service, outsourcing of activities, and
cutting subsidies.

•

In addition, subsidies (including tax expenditure) for key items rose by ½ percentage
point of GDP over the past five years. Partly reversing this process (e.g., by lowering
the subsidies for service vouchers) will help fiscal adjustment and raise efficiency and
fairness. Moreover, tax exemptions (e.g., on some savings instruments) can usefully
be tightened.

Fiscal adjustment over the medium term will need to make up for the recent

slippage. The authorities argued that the measures adopted in the 2008 budget together with
upcoming reforms to fiscal federalism arrangements should set in motion sufficient
adjustment to deliver the HFC-recommended surplus of 1.1 percent of GDP by 2011,
consistent with a primary structural surplus of close to 4½ percent of GDP. Staff noted,
however, that future surpluses will need to exceed this path to make up for the recent
slippage and catch up with the required reduction in public debt. Interest savings from
favorable debt dynamics will then bring about further increases in nominal surpluses.
More generally, refocusing the fiscal framework on a medium-term path for the
27.
primary surplus will allow to anchor sustainable fiscal consolidation. The authorities
noted that moving away from a nominal budget target could complicate public
communication and accountability, but agreed that a multi-year expenditure framework
would help guide the annual budget process, including through the careful costing of
initiatives within a multi-year budgetary envelope. In addition, a performance-oriented
approach to budgeting should help increase efficiency and the effectiveness of public
services.

20
B. Why is There a Need to Revise Fiscal Federalism Arrangements?

28.
The current fiscal federalism arrangements have led to unsustainable fiscal
imbalances among different levels of government. Current expenditure and revenue
assignments will result in widening imbalances between the federal institutions (federal
government and social security, the so-called “Entity I”) and regional and local governments
(the so-called “Entity II,” Figure 15). With
Figure 15. Vertical Imbalance most of the increase in aging-related spending

burden in the context of changes in the fiscal
federalism arrangements, possibly through a

responsibilities from Entity I to Entity II. The
authorities agreed that such a shift would be

need to become fully accountable for any
decisions that impact the social security
system. In addition, strengthening the municipalities’ accountability for their budgetary
decisions was also necessary. The authorities hoped to be able to build a consensus to solve
these vertical imbalances in the next few months.
Current fiscal federalism arrangements also feature horizontal imbalances

within Entity II. These imbalances reflect

(Figure 16). While tempered by an

complexity to reaching agreement on

consensus will have to guide their resolution.
Source: High Finance Council
It will be essential that any new agreements be
neutral from a consolidated budget
perspective, provide incentives for regions to work toward narrowing income differences,
and are fully transparent about the intergovernmental solidarity mechanisms.

21
30.
Successful medium-term adjustment will also require greater accountability,
more transparency, and stronger coordination among government entities. The
arrangements to coordinate fiscal policy between levels of government centered on the High
Finance Council overall have been effective, but could be further strengthened. To avoid a
hiatus in these arrangements in periods of political uncertainty, targets for the different levels
of government could be fixed for a rolling multi-year horizon, which would facilitate
medium-term expenditure planning, and be embedded in published internal stability pacts.
The role of the High Finance Council could be reinforced and expanded through a mandate
that includes an assessment of compliance with the internal stability pact at the stage of
budget submission to parliament, and through a strengthening of the analytic capacity of the
HFC. The authorities agreed that further devolution of competencies would necessitate
strengthening of coordination and accountability for budgetary and other economic policies,
but there was no agreement yet on what mechanism to put in place.
V. STRUCTURAL REFORMS: RAISING EMPLOYMENT AND PRODUCTIVITY

31.
Pressing ahead with structural reforms, especially in the labor market, is key to
preserving high living standards. Without further reforms, demographic trends will
dampen long-term growth, as population aging curbs labor supply and sharply raises
dependency ratios. Despite recent increases, employment rates remain among the lowest in
the industrialized world, especially among older and low-skilled workers (Figure 17). While
some areas of the country are close to full employment, others are mired in high
unemployment, contributing to geographical differences in growth and income. In addition,
labor market participation is low throughout the country, underscoring fundamental skill
mismatches and limited labor mobility.

To sustain good rates of job creation, further labor market reforms will be
essential. The spotlight on activation policies (i.e., enforcing job search requirements and
providing job search assistance) has been appropriate, and has taken advantage of the until
recently buoyant economy. Nonetheless, better tailoring of labor market policies to regional
needs and coordination across regions and sub-regions is necessary to raise their
effectiveness. Consensus is lacking for a new round of comprehensive labor market reforms,
though most stakeholders agree on the need to further improve labor market performance.
Specifically, labor market reforms should involve:
•

Raising investment in human capital. There is broad agreement that the pursuit of
ongoing initiatives with respect to R&D, the further strengthening of programs for
on-the-job and life-long training, and an increase in the efficiency of secondary and
higher education are likely to pay off handsomely in terms of the economy’s ability to
adopt new technologies, attract foreign investment, and maintain comparatively high
living standards.

•

Removing inactivity traps and keeping older workers in the labor force. To achieve
the first, a comprehensive review of the tax-benefit system would be useful, but parts
of the political spectrum and labor unions are adverse to lowering or taxing benefits.
In line with OECD recommendations, a balanced reform could consist of the phasing
out of unemployment benefits—virtually all other industrialized countries have strict
time limits and phased benefits—in exchange for an increase in payouts during the
first few months of unemployment. It could be accompanied by the inclusion of all
out-of-work benefits and allowances in taxable income, in exchange for a gradual,
rather than immediate removal of these benefits when jobs are taken up.
Alternatively, a higher earned income tax credit could be considered. Such an
approach would reap the synergies between fiscal adjustment and labor market
polices. To help raise employment rates of older workers, the planned extension of
activation policies to these workers is welcome, but it will need to be complemented
by a complete phasing out of early retirement regimes.

•

Sustaining wage moderation and increasing wage flexibility. While the central
wage-bargaining framework is likely to continue to maintain wage moderation,
shifting its focus from job preservation to job creation would improve labor market
outcomes. To take better account of productivity differentials between regions,
sectors, and enterprises, and foster a dynamic reallocation of workers to new
activities, the practice of “all-in” wage agreements should be extended and larger
margins for wage differentiation allowed. Social partners, however, do not see a need
for any significant changes to the current wage-bargaining framework.

More competition in product markets will boost productivity. The authorities
33.
agreed that continuing the reduction in the administrative burden on businesses and
households, and the swift implementation of EU directives regarding market liberalization

23
and the removal of obstacles to competition would raise efficiency. They indicated that
progress in this area had fallen victim to the hiatus in federal policy making following the
June 2007 elections and suffered from lack of coordination between regional and federal
levels of government. With the preoccupation about fiscal federalism reforms, they conceded
that reviving attention for structural reform could take a while.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL

34.
With growth slowing and the window to address population aging closing
rapidly, returning to an ambitious reform agenda has become urgent. Expectations a
year ago that, following the June 2007 elections, a new federal government would take
immediate decisive action to meet long-term challenges have not been validated. The
difficulty in creating consensus around much needed fiscal federalism reforms has so far
prevented the emergence of a full-fledged government and diverted attention from these
priorities. However, further delays in building up fiscal surpluses and boosting employment
rates and productivity cannot be afforded. Meanwhile, clarifying the direction of policies
early on has become especially important now that other sources of uncertainty cloud the
outlook.
Addressing the cyclical downturn through automatic fiscal stabilizers is
35.
appropriate, while the impact of partial indexation on competitiveness will require
continued wage moderation. After several years of robust economic performance, growth is
expected to slow significantly, mostly owing to external factors. In addition, risks are tilted
to the downside. Provided fiscal consolidation is resumed, the authorities’ intention to allow
fiscal stabilizers to operate fully and abandon the procyclical use of one-off measures to meet
nominal budget targets is welcome. Similarly, limiting the response to energy price spikes to
an increase in well-targeted and capped income support for the lowest-income households is
apposite. Indeed, with widespread partial indexation, broader measures would be
counterproductive. Furthermore, maintaining competitiveness, which is broadly fine at its
current level, will require wage moderation going forward.
Maintaining a sound financial system and high-quality supervision are
36.
paramount. Financial institutions have remained resilient in the face of the ongoing
financial turbulence, but market conditions have yet to return to normal and a stronger-thanexpected economic slowdown could prove taxing. Financial institutions therefore need to
uphold capital buffers. Actions by supervisors to promote early disclosure of exposures and
losses and enhanced transparency practices would be welcome as they would help dampen
market volatility and underpin confidence. While already high-quality prudential supervision
is being further enhanced, the relentless rise in the cross-border dimension of the financial
system requires stronger coordination with host country authorities.
Resuming ambitious fiscal consolidation and improving fiscal frameworks and
37.
federalism arrangements are urgent priorities. While there has so far been broad support
for a strategy of pre-funding of the expected rise in aging costs, actual fiscal consolidation

24
has slipped below the path recommended by the High Finance Council as the result of the
hiatus in policy making at the federal level since April 2007. It will be important to get back
on track as soon as possible:
•

From this perspective, the intention to resume fiscal consolidation in 2008 is
welcome, but a more ambitious effort, amounting to an improvement in the structural
balance by ½ percent of GDP, would better underpin credibility and bolster
confidence in economic policies.

•

Delivering the necessary structural adjustment will require a concerted effort at all
levels of government. There is no room for new spending initiatives or tax cuts, while
the high tax pressure, especially on labor, also rules out further increases in the
overall tax burden. Expenditure restraint will thus need to be the primary source of
adjustment.

•

Refocusing the fiscal framework on a medium-term path for the primary surplus will
be key to achieving consolidation objectives. The authorities’ intent to avoid recourse
to one off measures is welcome, as such measures often imply nontransparent claims
on future resources. In the same vein, recourse to public-private partnerships, which
has risen substantially recently, should be restrained.

•

Finally, while a broad consensus will need to guide the revision of fiscal federalism
arrangements, it will be important that new arrangements be neutral from a
consolidated budgetary perspective, provide incentives for regions to narrow income
differences, and be accompanied by strengthened accountability and stronger
coordination of economic policies across all levels of government.

Implementing a new round of structural reforms will be essential to reap
38.
synergies with fiscal adjustment and achieve the much needed increase in employment
rates and productivity growth. Progress in raising employment rates is evident, owing to
better activation policies, while initiatives with respect to training, education and R&D
investments are likely to pay off in terms of productivity. Meanwhile, the wage bargaining
framework continues to deliver wage moderation. Nonetheless, labor market performance is
still lagging well behind the OECD average, and large geographical differences in
unemployment rates reflect deep-rooted structural problems. Priority areas for reform are
removing inactivity traps, raising low employment rates of older workers, and fostering labor
mobility. Addressing these issues would generate synergies between fiscal adjustment and
labor market reforms. Further goods and services markets reforms would boost productivity
growth and consumer welfare.

It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
39.
cycle.

Exchange Rate Arrangements

•

Belgium’s currency is the euro, which floats freely and independently against other
currencies.

•

Belgium maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers
for current international transactions, except for restrictions maintained solely for
security reasons. These measures are established by European Union regulations and
have been notified to the Fund pursuant to Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51)
(see EBD/90/251 (8/17/90), EBD/94/187 (11/29/94), EBD/92/139 (7/7/92) and
EBD/06/133 (11/6/2006)).

FSAP Participation:

FSAP Assessment

IMF Country Report No. 06/75

Summary: The report concluded that Belgium’s financial system is resilient and benefits from a
number of Belgium-specific features that help stability. These include a traditionally cautious
attitude toward risk by banks, large holdings of government securities, extremely low holdings
of equity by banks, a stable source of funding benefiting from generous tax incentives, a high
standard of banking supervision, and a stable macroeconomic policy framework. Overall,
supervision showed a high degree of compliance with international standards. Near-term
vulnerability appears low, reflecting the soundness of the dominant banking system, the
generally benign financial environment, the strong financial condition of the corporate sector,
and the relatively healthy financial position of the household sector. Financial institutions were
found to withstand an adverse macroeconomic stress well, helped in part by the beneficial
diversification in the bancassurance model.

33

Notwithstanding the strengths of the Belgian financial sector, a number of issues emerged from
the FSAP. The heavy exposure abroad, the open nature of the economy, and the importance of
the Euroclear Group globally, made the domestic financial system potentially vulnerable to
global economic developments and financial contagion. Risks remained and may increase with a
downturn in the business cycle, increased cross-border operations, and deeper links with the
global money centers. In line with the 2005 FSAP recommendations, the supervisory framework
has been strengthened. The Banking, Finance, and Insurance Commission’s (CBFA)
management committee has been streamlined and synergies between the CBFA and the National
Bank of Belgium (NBB) have been further developed. Regular stress tests have helped promote a
systematic dialogue between supervisory authorities and market participants, while detailed
procedures for financial crisis management have been tested. Prudential supervision of the
insurance sector has been upgraded and regulation of the pension funds sector reinforced.

34
APPENDIX II. BELGIUM: STATISTICAL ISSUES

Belgium’s economic and financial statistics are adequate for surveillance purposes. The
National Bank of Belgium (NBB) regularly publishes a full range of economic and financial
data and provides calendar dates of main statistical releases. On-line access to these
comprehensive databases is facilitated by the NBB’s data search engine, Belgostat. Belgium
is a SDDS subscriber. Statistics for International Financial Statistics on banking institutions
and monetary aggregates are prepared on a monthly basis and are timely.
Belgium adopted the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts 1995 (ESA95)
in 1999. Revisions of national accounts started in November 2005 to comply with
EUROSTAT requirements and prepare for the adoption of chain-linked national accounts
statistics. Unlike in other countries, the NBB is responsible for compiling national accounts
statistics. Quarterly accounts are published within a lag of three months. Both annual and
quarterly accounts data are of good quality, with shortcomings mainly related to export and
import deflators, which are based on unit values, rather than prices collected directly from
exporters and importers.
General government revenue, expenditure, and balance on an accrual basis (ESA95) are
published annually. The NBB publishes monthly data on central government operations and
quarterly data on general government operations since April 2007.
The overall quality and availability of financial indicators are good. The authorities are
providing quarterly updates of financial sector indicators (FSIs) in a timely manner.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
BELGIUM
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European Department
(In consultation with the Policy Development and Review Department)
Approved by Alessandro Leipold and Michael Hadjimichael
March 19, 2008

This supplement to the staff report for the 2007 Article IV consultation with Belgium
provides an update on the staff’s revised economic outlook, recent developments in financial
markets, and the 2008 budget proposal. A fiscal ROSC is being issued separately in the
context of this Article IV consultation. The information does not alter the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
Summary
Growth is forecast to dip to 1.4 percent in 2008, somewhat lower than anticipated in the staff
report due to a further weakening of the global environment. Headline inflation has risen
more than expected in January, given higher oil and food prices. The financial system has
absorbed further write-downs linked to the ongoing financial turmoil. The government has
reached agreement on balancing the 2008 general government budget.
Output and inflation
1.
Staff projects a deceleration of GDP growth to 1.4 percent in 2008, from
1.6 percent growth in the Staff Report (Table 1). The revision is driven by slower growth
in the U.S. and Europe and reflects broadly evenhanded reductions in growth among
Belgium’s main economic partners. While consumer and business confidence remained
strong in January, encouraged by continued credit supply, inflation is higher and the impact
of the global financial market turmoil is expected to be larger than envisaged earlier. In
addition, significant downside risks remain, related to the international environment and
financial turmoil.

2
Financial sector
2.
The financial sector disclosed additional subprime-related losses. Recent
volatility in equity prices as well as a widening of credit default spreads indicates continuing
market concerns about asset valuations and their implications for banks’ earnings and capital.
Credit default swap spreads have increased sharply for all Belgian banks, in line with those
for banks in other euro area countries, and perhaps also related to exposure to emerging
Europe whose vulnerabilities have risen. Fortis, Belgium’s largest bank, reported a
45 percent decline in Q4 profits and has further shored up its capital. While Moody’s
reaffirmed the AAA rating of Dexia’s U.S bond insurance unit, FSA, Dexia’s CDS spreads
continued to increase. If they remain high or widen further, additional accounting impacts on
Dexia’s first quarter results may be expected.

The authorities agreed on balancing the 2008 general government budget. The
federal budget frees up €340 million (0.1 percentage point of GDP) for well-targeted
initiatives to support purchasing power, notably through an increase in small pensions and a
tax reduction for low-income workers. At the same time, a special tax for power companies,
the sale of vacant government-owned buildings, and increased efforts to reduce tax fraud are
expected to boost revenues. Regional authorities have agreed to aim for a surplus of
0.2 percent of GDP in 2008. Discussions on the economic program for the follow up fullfledged federal government—which is to take office before end-March—continue and will
be reflected in the new budget. Achieving a balanced budget would imply essentially no
structural adjustment on the basis of the authorities’ macroeconomic assumptions. The
budget agreement does not materially alter the staff’s appraisal, though the recourse to oneoff measures (albeit on an admittedly very limited scale, slightly less than 0.1 percent of
GDP) reduces somewhat the quality of the underlying adjustment (Text Table 1 and Table 2).

Fiscal ROSC
4.
Belgium broadly meets, and in several areas exceeds, the requirements of the fiscal
transparency code. Budget formulation is supported by medium-term macroeconomic
forecasts and clearly formulated medium-term fiscal policy goals. On the expenditure side,
there is room to clarify objectives and targets to help gear decision-making toward the
medium term. More information could be included in the budget on tax expenditures and
fiscal risks, while institutional arrangements for fiscal policy coordination could be
strengthened. A detailed assessment is presented in the accompanying Report on The
Observance of Standards and Codes: Fiscal Transparency Module.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 28, 2008

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
Belgium
On March 21, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Belgium.1
Background
With a supportive external environment and buoyant domestic demand, GDP is estimated to
have grown by 2.7 percent in 2007 and unemployment declined to its lowest level since 2002.
Rapid job creation contributed to rising households’ net disposable income and private
consumption. Meanwhile, business investment firmed up, boosted by strong net revenue growth
in the first half of 2007. However, headwinds from a worsening international environment,
combined with domestic political tensions, contributed to a slowdown of activity toward the end
of the year.
Looking ahead, the spike in oil prices, euro appreciation, the spillovers from the global financial
turmoil, and dimmer economic prospects in partner countries will exert a drag on activity.
Hence, the staff projects output growth to weaken to 1.4 percent in 2008. Greater economic
uncertainty and less favorable financing conditions will lower business investment and
consumption will decelerate in response to more sluggish real disposable income growth and a
slower pace of job creation. Moreover, concerns about the depth and persistence of the ongoing
financial market turmoil and its effects on growth constitute downside risks.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
Headline inflation has risen to 3.5 percent in January 2008 with the surge in food and energy
prices. Partial wage indexation will boost wages and shield purchasing power,
but it will drive up hourly labor costs in excess of what was envisaged in earlier wage
agreements. These agreements contained moderate wage increases to help preserve
competitiveness. The authorities have responded to the energy price spike by raising targeted
income support for the energy needs of low-income households.
The ongoing financial turbulence has so far had only a limited impact on the financial system
and the economy. Banks’ exposure to the U.S. subprime market is small, bank capitalization is
strong, and liquidity shocks have been absorbed. Nonetheless, recent volatility in equity prices
as well as a widening of credit default spreads indicates continuing market concerns about
asset valuations and their implications for banks’ earnings and capital. Meanwhile, the crossborder dimension of the financial system has gained further importance with a partial merger
between a Belgian and Dutch bank.
With political tensions following the June 2007 elections, federal policy making has been at a
standstill, delaying fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. The 2007 general government
outcome is estimated to show a small deficit, short of the planned surplus of 0.3 percent of
GDP. The stance of fiscal policy was broadly neutral, with the structural balance remaining
close to balance. The authorities agreed on resuming fiscal consolidation and balancing the
2008 general government budget. Current fiscal federalism arrangements have led to
unsustainable fiscal imbalances, both between the federal and regional entities and between
the regions, but lack of consensus about a new allocation of competencies between federal and
regional governments has delayed their reform.
Demographic trends are projected to dampen long-term growth, as population aging curbs labor
supply and sharply raises dependency ratios. Despite recent increases, employment rates
remain among the lowest in the industrialized world. At the same time, skill mismatches and
geographical differences in growth and income persist, amid limited labor mobility.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the upswing of recent years with robust growth continuing in
2007 that brought unemployment down to a low level. Directors noted, however, that the
economy now faces headwinds, largely due to external factors. They commended the
authorities for their prudent 2008 budget and the well-targeted approach to addressing the
consequences of the spike in inflation. Looking forward, Directors noted the need to address
population aging, and encouraged the authorities to adopt a program of medium-term fiscal
consolidation and implement reforms to raise employment rates and productivity.
Directors noted that prudent domestic policies are called for to meet the challenge of the nearterm outlook. With protracted global financial turmoil and the slowdown in partner countries,
GDP growth is expected to weaken in 2008 and remain subdued in 2009. This combined with a
sharp rise in inflation presents significant policy challenges. They encouraged the authorities to
allow fiscal stabilizers to operate fully around a medium-term consolidation path and avoid
recourse to one-off measures to achieve nominal budget objectives. Given the widespread

3
practice of wage indexation and the increase in targeted support for low-income households,
they felt that purchasing power is adequately protected and called for continued wage
moderation to prevent a further erosion in competitiveness.
Directors noted that the financial system had been only moderately affected by the recent
financial market turbulence, but cautioned that its resilience was likely to be tested further. They
supported the authorities’ encouragement of early and transparent disclosure and saw the need
to ensure that financial institutions maintain adequate capital buffers to deal with further risks.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ continuing efforts to further enhance already high-quality
supervision, and noted that—with ongoing cross-border consolidation modifying the financial
landscape considerably—deeper coordination with host country authorities will be needed.
Recognizing that the political situation had caused delays in policymaking, Directors
encouraged the new government to take decisive and medium-term oriented action. They
welcomed the intention to achieve a balanced budget for the general government in 2008,
underpinned by the regional authorities’ efforts to aim for a larger-than-planned surplus.
Nonetheless, Directors felt that the credibility of the authorities’ strategy to deal with aging will
depend on promptly adopting the structural expenditure restraint needed to return the fiscal
consolidation path to that recommended by the High Finance Council, and on making up for
recently lost ground over the medium term.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to revise fiscal federalism arrangements to
address fiscal imbalances among different levels of government. They underscored that any
new agreements should be neutral from a consolidated budget perspective, provide incentives
for regions to narrow income differences, and be transparent about the intergovernmental
solidarity mechanisms. Directors noted that further devolution of competencies would need to
be accompanied by strengthened accountability and stronger coordination among federal and
sub-federal entities of economic policies, for which existing fiscal institutions may need to be
strengthened.
Directors saw labor and product market reforms as vital to raise growth, reduce unemployment,
increase employment rates, and boost productivity. They recommended comprehensive reforms
that would involve a further streamlining and coordinating of labor market policies across
regions, an improvement in training and education, a revision of the tax-benefit system, and
phasing out early retirement schemes. Directors felt that the wage bargaining framework ought
to be made more conducive to achieving higher employment rates.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
