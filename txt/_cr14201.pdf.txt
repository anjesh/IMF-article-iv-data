STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
May 19, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Setting: Lesotho achieved strong economic growth in recent years, with only moderate
inflation. International reserves have largely been rebuilt, thanks to a sustained period of
fiscal restraint and recovery in revenues from the Southern African Customs Union
(SACU). However, unemployment remains high and poverty is widespread, especially in
rural areas. Since 2012, Lesotho has been led by a coalition government with a slim
majority.
Outlook and risks: Growth is expected to be robust over the medium term—led by
mining, construction, and services—but there are risks, mainly arising from Lesotho’s
heavy dependence on volatile SACU revenues. A loosening of the fiscal stance in the
recently approved budget for 2014/15 threatens to erode official international reserves.
The budget also indicates that recurrent expenditures—most notably the government
wage bill—will remain elevated over the medium term.
Policy mix: Staff recommends a more moderate easing in the fiscal stance than the
budget’s and curbing recurrent expenditures to allow greater investment for inclusive
growth. Preserving international reserves—to ensure a secure exchange rate peg—and
debt sustainability are critical for macroeconomic stability. Over time a rules-based fiscal
framework could strengthen stability.
Financial sector: Overall, indicators point to a sound banking system. Implementing the
Financial Sector Development Strategy would improve access to financial services and
support private sector development.
Structural agenda: An ambitious reform effort, particularly in the fiscal area, is needed
to achieve a more efficient public sector and enable private sector-led growth.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK AND RISKS
A. Economic Developments in 2010/11–2013/14
1.

The Lesotho economy performed well in recent years, despite being hit by a severe

balance of payments and fiscal shock and periods of adverse weather conditions for
agriculture. Since fiscal year 2010/11 (April-March), real GDP growth averaged just over
5 percent a year—driven by large scale investments in the mining and water sectors—while
annual inflation fluctuated between 3½ and 6 percent (Tables 1-6 and Figures 1–3). An ample
stock of official international reserves, together with a large fiscal adjustment initiated in 2010/11,
was critical to this positive outturn, as revenue from the Southern African Customs Union
(SACU)—which is also Lesotho’s main source of foreign exchange—fell by more than half (to
about 15 percent of GDP a year in 2010/11 and 2011/12). The Lesotho loti’s hard peg to the
South African rand remained secure throughout this crisis, but a large share of international
reserves was consumed in the process. Maintaining a relatively tight fiscal stance then allowed
for a rapid replenishment of international reserves, when SACU revenues recovered in 2012/13.
This adjustment effort was supported by the Fund with a three-year arrangement under the
Extended Credit Facility (ECF), which was successfully concluded in September 2013 (Box 1).
2.

Fiscal performance slipped in 2013/14, but official gross international reserves still

inched higher (to 4.8 months of imports for the following year). The deterioration of the
fiscal performance was largely the result of a dip in SACU revenues (relative to GDP) and a
shortfall in domestic tax revenues,1 while recurrent expenditure rose slightly (to over 45 percent
of GDP), led by increased spending on wages. The overall fiscal balance fell into deficit (more
than 1 percent of GDP), after recording a significant surplus the year before. The core SACU fiscal
deficit, which helps to gauge the underlying fiscal stance, also widened (by over 2½ percentage
points of GDP to nearly 8½ percent of GDP).2 Although capital spending subsided, mainly
reflecting poor project implementation, external borrowing remained elevated in 2013/14, which
facilitated the increase in reserves.

1

The authorities are investigating the unexpected tax revenue shortfall. The ongoing restructuring of the Lesotho
Revenue Authority (LRA) may have temporarily disrupted collections, which fell by a percentage point of GDP
relative to the previous year and were well below budget expectations.
2

Core SACU revenues is a construct that represents the stable component of SACU revenues. They are defined as
the minimum annual amount of revenues received (15 percent of GDP) over the past 20 years. The core SACU
fiscal deficit excludes the volatile (non-core) component of SACU revenues, as well as spending on projects
financed by external borrowing.

Box 1. IMF Policy Advice in the 2012 Article IV Consultation and Program Outcome
Lesotho’s previous Article IV consultation was completed on April 12, 2012, in conjunction with the
combined second and third review of its program supported by a three-year arrangement under the
Extended Credit Facility (ECF).
Since then, the authorities achieved progress in the following areas recommended by staff:
 Macroeconomic stability was enhanced by rebuilding international reserves and strengthening debt
sustainability; notably, a substantial fiscal surplus was achieved in 2012/13.
 Domestic arrears were audited and largely eliminated; a time-bound plan for capacity building was
adopted, and the front office revenue receipting system was implemented.
 Despite fiscal adjustment various social programs were safeguarded (such as, school-feeding, old-age
pensions, and the HIV/AIDS program), although there remain questions about their effectiveness at
protecting the most vulnerable.
 The Financial Institutions Act, which strengthened the regulatory and supervisory frameworks for banks
and non-banks, was enacted.
However, there have also been some setbacks:
 Under execution of the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP).
 Public financial management—specifically cash management and the integrated financial management
and information system (IFMIS)—remains weak.
 Private sector development continues to be hampered by a difficult business environment, as
manifested by long delays in issuing construction permits, limited access to finance, difficult property
registration, obstacles to cross-border trade, and weak enforcement of contracts.
 The supervisory capacity of the Central Bank of Lesotho (CBL) needs further improvement.
The 2012 Article IV consultation provided a basis for the policy agenda for the latter part of the
ECF-supported program. The sixth and final review of the program was completed on September 9, 2013.
Over the course of the program all but two quantitative performance criteria (PC) were met—early in the
program, net international reserves fell slightly short of the target; also, a nonconcessional external loan was
contracted. As indicated above, progress on the structural agenda was mixed. Out of 19 structural
benchmarks, 7 were implemented as programmed, 10 with delays, and two—the monthly reconciliation of
all Treasury accounts and submission to Parliament of the amendments of the Loans and Guarantees
Act—remain outstanding.

3.

Despite robust economic growth, unemployment remains high and poverty is

widespread, particularly in rural areas. Moreover, several indicators point to worrisome
conditions, such as the low quality of primary and secondary education and a high incidence of
HIV/AIDS, which has had a devastating impact on life expectancy (Table 7).3 While there has been
progress on reducing infant, child, and maternal mortality rates in recent years, they are still high
relative to the more distant past. Poor implementation of the National Strategic Development
Plan (NSDP), which was officially launched in 2012, has weakened the fight against poverty. In
3

Life expectancy in Lesotho remains low at 46 years of age, reflecting a 23 percent incidence of HIV/AIDS.

addition, low capacity has impaired planning and implementation of government investment
projects intended to support more inclusive growth. Meanwhile, the public sector wage bill
(relative to GDP) is the highest in sub-Saharan Africa, partly due to political pressures to expand
employment.

Given that Lesotho had episodes of difficult political transition prior to 2012, the

NSDP places a high priority on strengthening the democratic process. In this context the
peaceful transfer of power to a coalition government following the elections in May 2012 was an
important milestone. Moreover, the government has made progress in fighting corruption and
strengthening governance, as evidenced by Lesotho’s moving up to the 55th place out of
177 countries in the Corruption Perception Index by Transparency International. To further
reduce corruption the government has emphasized compliance with public service regulations
that require senior officials to declare their assets. In addition, to improve accountability, the
government has been introducing performance contracts for cabinet ministers. However, with
only a slim (one-seat) majority in the National Assembly, there is some fragility in the coalition
government, which adds to the challenge of policy making. In late March 2014, the National
Assembly was adjourned indefinitely following the submission by the opposition of a noconfidence motion against the Prime Minister and coalition government.

B. Outlook and Risks for 2014/15 and the Medium Term
5.

The underlying strength of the Lesotho economy is expected to support robust

growth over the medium term. After dipping to 4 percent in 2014/15, real GDP growth is
projected to pick up to 5–5½ percent a year over the medium term, driven by projected strong
expansions in construction, mining, and private sector services. In particular, construction is
expected to receive a major boost from large infrastructure projects—most notably, the second
phase of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP-2) and a large mining project is expected
to begin production.4 At the same time, inflation is projected to remain moderate, in line with
that of South Africa.
6.

However, over the medium term, the economy is likely to become more vulnerable

to risks. In particular, based on the recently approved government budget for 2014/15 and the
authorities’ fiscal projections, persistent government deficits would consume existing buffers and
contribute to a rundown in official international reserves. Tax revenues are projected to grow
only slightly over the medium term, while government employee compensation is projected to
remain at about 20 percent of GDP. In addition, SACU revenues are projected to steadily decline
during this period, contributing to an increasing overall fiscal deficit. With net external financing
projected to hold steady at 3–3½ percent of GDP a year, the government would eventually start
drawing down on its deposits in the CBL. Correspondingly, official international reserves are
projected to decline to about 4 months of the following year’s imports over the medium term.
7.

Staff’s risk assessment identified the possibility of a sudden and permanent drop in

SACU revenues as a serious potential threat to the Lesotho economy (Table 8). While the
likelihood of a collapse in SACU revenues is considered to be low-to-medium in the near term,
recent experience has shown that the impact can be severe, especially if a drop in revenues is
prolonged or permanent. Staff also explored the impact of the possible expiration of Lesotho’s
trade preferences under the United States’ African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and

4

Investment in LHWP-2 is expected to total USD 1½–2 billion (or roughly 75–100 percent of today’s GDP) over
several years. Following a roughly USD 250 million investment, the expansion of the Liqhobong diamond mine is
expected to begin production within the upcoming year. These activities are conservatively projected to raise
GDP growth about 1 percentage point above Lesotho’s long-term average growth trend of 4½ percent a year
over the latter half of this decade.

spillover effects from a possible prolonged growth slowdown in South Africa and other emerging
markets.5

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Policy discussions centered on stepping-up implementation of the NSDP to achieve more inclusive,
private sector-led economic growth, while maintaining macroeconomic stability. Four main themes
emerged: (i) balancing macroeconomic policies for growth and stability; (ii) strengthening public
financial management (PFM); (iii) deepening the financial sector and maintaining its soundness;
and (iv) enhancing competitiveness and private sector development.

A. Policy Theme 1: Balancing Macroeconomic Policies to Support
Stability and Inclusive Growth
Ensuring macroeconomic stability
8.

Lesotho’s macroeconomic stability is anchored upon the loti’s hard peg to the rand,

which has helped to contain inflation and strengthened the country’s close economic and
financial ties with South Africa. To preserve confidence in the peg, it is critical for Lesotho to
maintain an ample stock of international reserves and sound fiscal policies, including debt
sustainability. Over the medium term, risks to macroeconomic stability could be mitigated by
moving toward a rules-based fiscal framework.
9.

The medium-term target for gross international reserves of the past few years

(equivalent to 5 months of the following year’s imports) remains appropriate. In addition to
fulfilling Lesotho’s commitments under the Southern Africa Common Monetary Area (CMA),6 this
target provides a fiscal cushion (equivalent to about 1½ months of imports or about 15 percent
of GDP). This cushion is much needed in light of the government’s heavy dependence on volatile
SACU revenues. Indeed, experience from the 2010/11-2011/12 SACU revenue crisis—when
reserves fell from over 6 months to about 3½ months of imports—demonstrated that the
additional fiscal cushion is warranted. Staff recommended that the authorities strive to achieve
the medium-term reserve target by end-2015/16, while SACU revenues are projected to still be
relatively strong. This would require a moderately tighter fiscal stance than the approved
2014/15 budget (Table 9).
5

The Fund’s Global Risk Assessment Matrix (G-RAM) updated in March 2014 places a high likelihood on the
possibility of a prolonged slowdown in emerging market economies. It is widely expected that the AGOA
program would be renewed.
6

The CMA requires members to maintain rand reserves equivalent to 100 percent of narrow money (M1). The
Central Bank of Lesotho (CBL) adheres to a more conservative minimum of 120 percent of M1, which is roughly
equivalent to 3½ months of imports.

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KINGDOM OF LESOTHO

10.

Lesotho remains at moderate risk of external debt distress, implying that the

authorities will need to exercise caution to maintain debt sustainability.7 Under the
approved 2014/15 budget, it is anticipated that government’s net external financing would be
3–3½ percent of GDP a year over the foreseeable future, which together with the large financing
needs of the forthcoming LHWP-2 project, would drive debt indicators toward their
corresponding thresholds for debt sustainability. Government external borrowing would need to
be limited largely to loans on concessional terms; although there is some scope for domestic
borrowing. Staff recommended limiting government annual net external borrowing to
1½–2 percent of GDP on concessional terms to provide a more comfortable margin for debt
indicators and macroeconomic stability. Staff also encouraged the authorities to submit the new
Public Debt Management Bill to parliament without further delay and to make the medium term
debt strategy operational.
11.

Over the medium term, moving toward a rules-based fiscal policy framework could

reduce Lesotho’s vulnerability to volatile SACU revenue (Box 2). That is, a rules-based
approach could reduce the pro-cyclicality of government spending and, by budgeting
appropriately for the volatility of revenues, reduce the exposure to revenue shortfalls. While it
would take some time to gain sufficient experience to determine and employ a firm rule, staff
recommended extending the current practice of segmenting SACU revenues between core
(permanent) and non-core (volatile) components, and targeting the core-SACU fiscal balance
such that eventually a surplus that is consistent with maintaining an adequate level of
international reserves, is generated. The volatile non-core component of SACU revenues could
then be directed toward capital spending, possibly using some averaging or a “permanent
income” approach to determine annual expenditures. The mission recommended researching
options, noting that lessons from countries with exhaustible natural resources might be relevant,
given that SACU revenues are volatile and expected to decline over time. Finally, because a wellfunctioning rules-based fiscal framework would mitigate much of the risk associated with volatile
SACU revenues, an analysis of reserve adequacy suggests that, once such a framework would be
in place, a lower level of reserves could be optimal (Appendix 1), thus freeing up resources for
additional capital spending down the road. Staff emphasized that transparency and quality public
financial management (PFM) are critical to the success of a rules-based approach.

Box 2. Lesotho: Developing a Rules-Based Fiscal Framework
Discretionary fiscal policy has led to significant swings in fiscal performance in Lesotho. Relaxed
spending constraints during periods of high SACU revenue required abrupt adjustment when SACU revenue
declined. This pro-cyclical pattern was temporarily broken in 2012/13, when fiscal policy focused on
maintaining a given fiscal deficit, excluding SACU revenues, so that the recovery in these revenues reduced
fiscal and external imbalances and secured international reserves and broadly sustainable debt.

A rules-based fiscal policy framework could help to balance immediate and medium-term fiscal
priorities with available resources.



Macroeconomic stability requires that fiscal balances support the reserve target. To this end, Lesotho
would need to maintain an overall surplus, consistent with a borrowing constraint. Over the medium
term, Lesotho could aim to finance recurrent spending and reserve accumulation with domestic
revenue, and channel SACU revenue toward development needs. This would require broadening the
tax base and streamlining recurrent spending. To mitigate the effects of volatile SACU revenue on
fiscal policy Lesotho could manage the fiscal stance by controlling a core SACU balance, which
excludes the volatile part.



Debt sustainability—the inter-temporal resource constraint—ensures government solvency. Lesotho
does not face an imminent risk of debt distress, but excessive spending when SACU revenues are
high could undermine fiscal stability. Imposing a debt ceiling and translating it into an annual
borrowing constraint would help ensure fiscal sustainability.



Refraining from pro-cyclical fiscal policy could help avoid abrupt fiscal adjustments. Countercyclical
policy may lead to savings in excess of those required by a reserve target, improving economy’s
resilience to shocks. Keeping expenditures constant or reducing them in percent of GDP during the
time of robust economic growth would allow the government to streamline recurrent spending and
raise capital expenditure. Once expenditures reached their optimal level, their growth could be
constrained by a numerical rule.

KINGDOM OF LESOTHO

Authorities’ view
12.

The authorities confirmed that the exchange rate peg has served Lesotho well,

particularly as the anchor for macroeconomic stability. They agreed that the medium-term
target for gross international reserves of five months of import coverage is still appropriate and
expressed concern over the deterioration of reserve under the budget projections. In particular,
they agreed that a somewhat tighter fiscal stance would be appropriate and that revenue and
spending measures would be needed. They emphasized, however, the CBL’s statutory
requirement to maintain reserves of 120 percent of narrow money (M1) is already a conservative
sum for safeguarding the loti’s parity with the rand, given the lower requirement under the CMA.
Over time, the authorities may want to explore if part of the fiscal cushion could be used to
finance development needs. They welcomed the implication that under an effective rules-based
fiscal framework, which requires strong public financial management, the optimal level of
reserves could be lower and agreed that further research on this issue is needed.8
13.

The authorities agreed with the conclusions of the DSA and the importance of debt

sustainability for macroeconomic stability. They will continue to seek low-cost sources of
external financing, including grants and concessional loans, to contain the debt burden, but
noted that the hydro-power component of the forthcoming LHWP-2 project would likely require
substantial financing on commercial terms, as assumed in the DSA. They agreed that the next
DSA update should take the findings of the ongoing LHWP-2 feasibility study into account, but
noted that staff should be open to various financing options that limit Lesotho’s exposure to risk.
Enhancing the inclusiveness of growth
14.

In line with the NSDP, the authorities envisage a multi-pronged approach to

generate more inclusive growth and reduce poverty. First, the government aims to step up its
investment spending to support growth in priority sectors (manufacturing, tourism, information
technology (IT), and commercial agriculture), which have the potential to create employment
opportunities. Second, the government allocates substantial resources to education, health, and
social transfers—such as pensions. Third, the authorities seek to create a more enabling
environment for private sector growth. While progress on these three fronts has been limited,
the authorities are trying to reinvigorate their efforts. In January 2014, a National Economic
Workshop was held to draw attention to some key issues, but further work is needed to form an
implementable action plan.
8

The authorities agreed that shifting to a rules-based fiscal framework should be a gradual process, which would
involve testing various options, such as limiting SACU revenues to financing government investment projects.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

KINGDOM OF LESOTHO

15.

However, under the approved budget, there is little scope for stepping up

government investment to support inclusive growth, despite the excessive loosening of
the fiscal stance. This is mainly because of a weakening in revenue collections and the further
expansion of recurrent expenditures. Staff recommended taking both immediate and mediumterm actions that could generate fiscal space for investment. On the revenue side, further tax
policy measures, including unification of the value-added tax rates, could be taken to build upon
the steps approved in the 2014/15 budget—notably, the elimination of the zero income tax rate
for non-SACU manufacturing companies, which would create a more level playing field in
manufacturing and simplify tax administration. In addition, based on recent Fund technical
assistance (TA), the authorities should prepare an action plan for tax reform, including taxation of
the mining sector and the introduction of a property tax. The Lesotho Revenue Authority (LRA)
must also strive to reverse the recent slippage in revenue collections by steadfastly implementing
a medium-term action plan to strengthen the LRA.9
16.

Ongoing efforts to rationalize the civil service are critical not only for generating

savings, but also for improving the delivery of government services. During the second half
of 2013/14, the government embarked upon pilot payroll audits in three line ministries
(Education, Health, and Local Government). Although there have been delays, the audits have
revealed large numbers of “ghost” employees. Staff urged the authorities to strengthen public
resource management by completing the pilot payroll audits and extending them to all ministries
during 2014/15, eliminating ghost employees, and strengthening management and control of
the public service. Once a clear picture of the civil service has been established, a functional
review is needed to ensure efficiency and the delivery of much needed services.10 Staff
recommends that after achieving greater efficiency in the civil service, the total wage bill be kept
constant in real terms to maintain discipline and create further fiscal savings that could be
directed to capital spending. Finally, an assessment is also needed for other recurrent
expenditures beyond the wage bill—such as keeping recurrent spending fixed in real terms.
Despite high levels of spending relative to GDP, progress on improving social indicators has been
weak.
17.

On capital spending, staff welcomed the authorities’ recent initiative to appraise all

new projects before including them in the budget. This would not only improve execution of
the capital budget, but could generate a higher rate of return on government investment and
9

Fund technical assistance has provided a basis for an action plan.

10

The authorities indicated that they will work more closely with the World Bank on rationalizing the civil service.

help focus scarce resources on the strategic sectors that enhance inclusiveness and employment.
Finally, whereas under execution of the capital budget has been an issue in recent years, staff
recommended that underutilized portions of capital budgets be retained exclusively for future
capital spending on priority needs.
18.

Taking these fiscal recommendations together demonstrates the potential to strike

a balanced macroeconomic policy framework that generates space for investment to
promote inclusive growth, while maintaining adequate international reserves and
preserving debt sustainability (see illustrative scenario in Table 9). Staff’s projections assume
that the above revenue measures could increase domestic revenue collections by ½ percentage
point of GDP a year over the medium term. Holding recurrent expenditures constant in real
terms would then open space for a gradual increase in capital spending of about 5 percentage
points of GDP by 2019/20, while achieving an overall fiscal surplus of about ½–2 percent of GDP
a year. This would be consistent with the target for international reserves and improved debt
sustainability.
Authorities’ view
19.

The authorities agreed that actions are needed to generate fiscal space for capital

spending and development projects to support inclusive growth. They have begun to
investigate the recent shortfall in tax collections, with a view toward correcting problem areas in
the LRA. With further TA support from the Fund, they also hope to implement an action plan for
tax reform. The authorities indicated that they would refrain from issuing mining licenses until
after a new mining tax regime is in place. Moreover, they agreed that addressing high recurrent
expenditures—and the wage bill in particular—is a matter of urgency. They are pressing ahead
with the pilot payroll audits, including an ongoing verification process whereby civil servants
need to collect their paychecks in person with the proper identification, and will expand the audit
to the rest of the civil service shortly.11 They also agree that the Ministry of Public Service
urgently needs to regain management control of the establishment list (hirings). While the
authorities did not commit to putting any ceiling on the wage bill over the medium term, they
explained that the 2014/15 budget does not include any real wage increases, except for police
officers (M25 million).12 Finally, with a view toward rationalizing public sector employment, they
11

The authorities will request TA for the payroll audit from the World Bank. Progress on the audit will be an
important factor for future budget support from the Bank.
12

Most of the increase in the wage bill in 2014/15 is a reclassification of wage payments that had previously been
classified as grants.

will conduct a functional review of the entire civil service, once the payroll audits have been
completed.
20.

The authorities emphasized that the new policy on project appraisals is an

important step forward to improve the effectiveness and implementation of the capital
budget. They have stepped up the appraisal of projects, to minimize any delays in including new
projects in the budget. The authorities acknowledged the need to address the unspent capital
appropriations.
Mitigating risks to the medium-term outlook
21.

A significant and, possibly, permanent reduction in SACU revenues is the major risk

facing Lesotho. For instance, a permanent decline in SACU revenue to 15 percent of GDP would
require substantial fiscal adjustment to preserve macroeconomic stability. To mitigate other risks,
it is necessary that the authorities maintain an ample stock of international reserves and a
relatively disciplined fiscal policy. In particular, the estimated magnitude of the potential
slowdown in South Africa is relatively modest.13 In addition, spillovers affecting Lesotho from a
weakening of South Africa’s economy (and the global economy more generally) can have
offsetting effects, such as lower prices for imported fuel and lower interest rates. Nevertheless,
possible layoffs of Basotho miners in South Africa would reduce remittances and lead to a
modest widening of the current account deficit and slower accumulation of reserves. Lesotho’s
medium-term economic growth, however, is driven primarily by construction and the domestic
mining sector, which would slow down only slightly. Given the relatively low value added of
textile manufacturing in Lesotho, the main risk from adverse developments to AGOA would be
the fiscal impact of worker layoffs, since the net impact on the balance of payments and tax
revenue side are small.
Authorities’ view
22.

The authorities agreed with the thrust of staff’s risk assessment. They agreed that a

significant and permanent decline in SACU revenue would require a major shift in
macroeconomic policies. They also acknowledged the importance of maintaining adequate
international reserves to mitigate risks, and saw the value of moving toward a rules-based fiscal
framework to reduce vulnerabilities.
13

Based on simulations using the Fund’s Vulnerability Exercise for Low-Income Countries and the G-RAM’s
projected slowdown in South Africa’s average annual growth rate (of about ½ percentage point).

B. Policy Theme 2: Strengthening Public Financial Management to
Improve Government Services
23.

Public financial management in Lesotho is weak, seriously impairing budget

planning, execution, and monitoring and the overall delivery of government services. Staff
encouraged the authorities to build upon the PFM workshop that was held in November 2013,
and actively pursue the implementation of the PFM reform action plan. Efforts need to be
stepped up in the following areas: (i) strengthening the PFM Secretariat so that it can advance
the reform agenda and coordinate the contributions of development partners; (ii) making the
Cash Management Unit (CMU) operational and introducing the monthly reconciliation of all
Treasury accounts to strengthen the auditing of government operations; (iii) implementing the
IFMIS upgrade; (iv) finalizing the draft regulations for the Public Financial Management Act
(PFMA); (v) strengthening the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) to ensure
meaningful medium-term expenditure ceilings to line ministries; and (vi) building government’s
capacity for project appraisal to enable capital spending to generate high returns. Finally, staff
encouraged the authorities to submit the Public Debt Management bill to parliament without
any further delay and to ensure its expedient passage and implementation in order to strengthen
debt management procedures and eliminate the remaining legal loopholes, including the
issuance of government guarantees to private entities. The draft law would give legal backing to
the work of the Debt Management Committee which is required to review and analyze all
requests for guarantees and, among other things, conduct due diligence and analysis of possible
risks. The single public debt ceiling would also include guarantees granted by the government.
Authorities’ views
24.

The authorities acknowledged the need to step up PFM reforms and assured staff

that the recently appointed Accountant General has been working on making the CMU
operational, collaborating with the World Bank on implementing IFMIS upgrades and
introducing monthly reconciliation of all Treasury Accounts. The weak capacity of the
Drafting Office has led to a delay in a submission of the Public Debt Management Bill to
parliament and the completion of drafting the PFMA regulations.

C. Policy Theme 3: Sound Deepening of the Financial Sector
25.

Lesotho’s financial sector is dominated by the banking system, which as a whole

appears quite sound (see Table 6). There are four commercial banks, three of which are
subsidiaries of South African banks and account for over 95 percent of total loans and deposits.
The fourth bank, the Lesotho Post Bank, is government-owned and has long faced solvency
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

KINGDOM OF LESOTHO

issues. For the system as a whole, nonperforming loans are small (3.8 percent of total loans as of
end-2013), much of which was covered by banks’ provisions. Financial intermediation is still
limited in Lesotho, especially on the credit side (below 21 percent of GDP), even though lending
received a substantial boost by the passage of the Land Act in 2012, which allowed residents to
use their property as collateral for bank loans.
26.

The nonbank financial system continues to be dominated by pension plans and

insurance companies, with assets amounting to 17 percent and 14½ percent of GDP,
respectively, as of end-2012.14 The principal challenges facing these nonbank financial
institutions (NBFIs) are: (i) only about ¼ of wage earners participate in the pension plans, and
these are mostly public sector employees; and (ii) the regulatory framework and supervision of
the insurance sector are weak. Expanding the coverage of pension plans could generate a
valuable source of long-term savings available to finance investment. For the insurance sector,
there has been some progress with oversight in recent years. First, two small insurance
companies that were insolvent have been absorbed by larger companies. Also, the new Insurance
Bill was approved by parliament in mid-May 2014. The bill is a major improvement over the
previous Insurance Act, which dates back to 1975 and is marked by excessive rigidities. However,
the new bill does not cover insurance intermediaries—agencies and brokers—despite evidence
of inappropriate and risky business practices. The authorities are preparing implementing
regulations and amendments, including coverage of intermediaries. Also, training is needed to
strengthen supervision of the industry.
27.

Better access to finance, sound financial intermediation and financial sector

deepening would support private sector development. Staff welcomed the authorities’ efforts
to strengthen banking regulation and supervision, launch a credit bureau in June 2014, and step
up work on developing microfinance institutions. In line with Fund TA, staff recommended to
finalize regulations supporting the implementation of the 2012 Financial Institutions Act (FIA);
strengthen on- and off-site supervision; and gradually adopt pillar II of the Basel II capital
accords. Given the dominant role of South Africa’s banks in Lesotho, it is important to strengthen
cross-border supervision by enhancing coordination with the South Africa Reserve Bank,
including the updating of the memorandum of understanding for cooperation and information
sharing. In addition, the CBL needs to formulate a training curriculum for staff, especially new
employees, that among other things builds capacity in risk-based supervision and to pursue a
14

credits cooperatives (SACCOs).

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KINGDOM OF LESOTHO

human resources policy that would increase retention of high-performers, including career
advancement. The approval of the Financial Sector Development Strategy (FSDS)—an important
milestone in financial sector development—needs to be followed by its expedient
implementation.15 To this end, staff recommended (i) to conduct a strategic review of the Post
Bank considering options of continued stand-alone operation, seeking a strategic partner, or
winding down operations; (ii) develop the interbank market and the CBL’s capacity for liquidity
management; and (iii) take steps to establish a yield curve, including issuance of treasury bills
and bonds of various maturities.
Authorities’ views
28.

The authorities noted that strengthening financial sector supervision and the

implementation of the FSDS are major priorities. They acknowledged that the completion of
financial regulation facilitating the implementation of the FIA has been delayed, due to the low
capacity of the Drafting Office. They expect that approval by parliament of the Insurance Bill
would strengthen the regulatory framework for the insurance industry and noted that they have
been strengthening the regulatory framework for pension funds. The CBL has been closely
monitoring non-performing loans and the risks remain contained, since banks are cautious in
their lending and maintain high loan-loss provisions.

D. Policy Theme 4: Enhancing Competitiveness and Enabling Private
Sector Development
29.

A sustained structural reform effort will be needed to support the growth strategy.

Staff recommended stepping up structural reforms promoting international competitiveness and
private sector development, in collaboration with the World Bank, in the context of the Second
Growth and Competitiveness Development Policy Grant (Box 3). This work should aim at
addressing the shortcomings of the business environment by drafting the Business Registration
Bill and accompanying regulations; regulations for the Industrial Licensing Bill; streamlining the
construction permit system within the Maseru City Council; modernizing the Insolvency
Proclamation to facilitate debt enforcement collective creditor recovery; and further
strengthening anti-corruption efforts.
15

The FSDS is a comprehensive plan that covers financial inclusion and literacy, creditors’ rights, the
strengthening of institutions, financial innovations and payments systems, resource mobilization, as well as
strategies to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory frameworks for banking, insurance, and pensions. The
FSDS benefitted from extensive World Bank and Fund TA.

Box 3. External Stability Assessment: Exchange Rate and Competitiveness
Staff’s exchange rate assessment exercise suggests that the Lesotho loti is broadly in line with
medium term fundamentals (Appendix 2). The approaches used yielded the following results:





External sustainability - undervalued by about 5 percent.
Equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) - undervalued by about 16 percent.
Macroeconomic balance - the real exchange rate is in line with equilibrium.

In view of data weaknesses, staff finds the macroeconomic balance approach to be the most reliable.
Results from the ERER approach are skewed towards undervaluation by Lesotho’s high levels of
government consumption (due in part to large SACU revenue transfers) and remittance inflows.
Recent surveys indicate that Lesotho has a poor
environment for private sector growth and place it
among the world’s less competitive countries. The
World Bank’s 2014 Doing Business Report ranks Lesotho
136th (out of 185), identifying major problems in all
important stages of business—obtaining construction
permits, access to land and electricity, registering property,
access to credit, trading across borders, and enforcing
contracts. The 2013-14 Global Competitiveness Index (WEF)
rd
places Lesotho in 123 place (out of 148), citing among the
greatest problems access to finance, inadequate
infrastructure, inefficient government bureaucracy. Areas
where Lesotho has made progress in recent years include
streamlining procedures for property registration and
business licenses. For example, the number of days to start
a business was reduced to 29 days (from 73 days).
Ongoing initiatives to improve the business climate
include implementing the Land Act, Land
Administration Act, and the Companies Act. These acts
will facilitate land access, including through subleases, and
reduce the time needed to obtain a construction permit
(currently 330 days). The authorities are also seeking to
simplify cross-border trade. The authorities are setting up a
credit reference bureau and instituting the national ID
system, which are critical for increasing access to financing.

Authorities’ views
30.

The authorities acknowledged impediments to doing business, such as relatively

high costs, border controls, a narrow production base, and the dominant role of the
government in the economy. Moreover, structural issues, including cumbersome regulation
and legislation have made Lesotho less attractive for domestic and foreign investment, hindering
18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KINGDOM OF LESOTHO

the transfer of knowledge and skills. The implementation of the NSDP, according to the
authorities, would help closing infrastructure gaps and improving labor skills, potentially
strengthening Lesotho’s international competitiveness and expanding economy’s capacity. The
authorities plan to continue collaborating with the World Bank on improving business
environment.

E. Other Surveillance Issues
31.

Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance with some key data

shortcomings in fiscal and external sector statistics. The mission welcomed the recent release
of GDP data. To build further on this development the mission encouraged the authorities to
take steps to produce quarterly GDP data and GDP by expenditures. Production of monthly and
quarterly fiscal data would allow much better monitoring of government operations.
Authorities’ views
32.

The authorities acknowledged the need to improve the quality, coverage and

timeliness of data, including monthly and quarterly fiscal data, and noted that they have
been working with the developing partners on improving the quality and timeliness of
data.

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.

Lesotho’s economy performed well in recent years, despite being hit by a severe

balance of payments and fiscal shock and adverse weather conditions for agriculture. In
addition, since the crisis in 2010/11 and 2011/12, international reserves have largely been rebuilt
thanks to a period of fiscal adjustment and recovery in SACU revenues. However, progress
toward a sound macroeconomic policy framework stalled in 2013/14, due to fiscal slippages. In
addition, despite robust GDP growth, unemployment is still high and poverty remains
widespread, particularly in rural areas.
34.

The government budget recently approved by parliament has gone too far in

loosening the fiscal stance. This would lead to a rundown of international reserves and greater
exposure to risks over the medium term. Moreover, the budget continues to favor recurrent
expenditures, most notably the wage bill, rather than capital spending to support inclusive
growth. Instead, staff recommends a more balanced fiscal policy (small overall surpluses) that is
consistent with a gradual buildup of international reserves and debt sustainability, while also
creating space for increased capital spending to support inclusive growth. In particular, staff

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

KINGDOM OF LESOTHO

recommends that the authorities take immediate action to get the wage bill under control by
completing the ongoing payroll audits being piloted in the Ministries of Education, Health, and
Local Government and eliminating “ghost” workers. The payroll audit would then need to be
extended to the entire civil service. At the same time, it is critical that the Ministry of Public
Service regain its management control of the establishment list (hirings). Following the payroll
audits, the government could conduct a functional analysis of the civil service to ensure that
personnel are used most effectively. Fiscal savings achieved in this exercise could usefully be
directed to increase capital spending.
35.

Reversing the recent drop in government revenues is also important to achieve an

appropriate fiscal stance. This will require tax policy measures as well as a strengthening of
revenue administration, areas that have both benefitted from recent Fund TA. It is particularly
urgent that reform of mining taxation is implemented before any new mining licenses are
granted.
36.

Maintaining debt sustainability is critical to macroeconomic stability. Given the large

financing needs of the LHWP-2 project, it will be necessary for government to contain its own
borrowing needs—and to limit this borrowing to concessional loans—to ensure sustainability.
Submission to parliament of the new Public Debt Management Bill, which has been held up in
the Drafting Office, is critical for ensuring that the Ministry of Finance has full control of the debt.
37.

The loti’s hard peg to the South African rand has served Lesotho well by anchoring

macroeconomic stability, reducing the transactions cots, and facilitating financial
integration. Maintaining an ample stock of international reserves has helped to mitigate risks
and secure the peg. Staff recommends that the authorities explore moving toward a transparent
and predictable rules-based fiscal framework, which would further reduce risks and could
eventually reduce the need for international reserves, thus opening up more fiscal space for
scaling up capital spending.
38.

PFM reform is critical to a successful macroeconomic policy framework in Lesotho.

At this time, there are serious difficulties with budget planning, execution, and monitoring, which
not only impair macroeconomic policies but also weaken the effectiveness of government
services. Staff urges the authorities to make the Cash Management Unit operational and to
conduct monthly reconciliation of all Treasury accounts as soon as possible.
39.

Deepening the financial sector, while maintaining its soundness, would be an

important contribution to an enabling environment for private sector led growth.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KINGDOM OF LESOTHO

Strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework, including effective cross-border
supervision with South Africa, would enhance financial sector stability. Establishing a functional
credit reference bureau could also be help reduce intermediation costs and increase access to
credit. Good progress on the comprehensive reform agenda to enhance private sector
competitiveness will also be critical for employment-creating inclusive growth.
40.

Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Lesotho take place on

the standard 12-month cycle.

The difference in "Revenue and grants" in the two scenarios is explained by the difference in tax revenue. In the
alternative scenario tax revenues increase by 0.5 percent of GDP per annum because of tax policy reforms and
improved tax administration.

Appendix I. Reserve Adequacy in Lesotho1
1.
Lesotho’s foreign reserves have increased significantly from about US$380 million in 2001
to about US$1100 million (43% of GDP) at end-2013. In comparison with other countries in the
Southern African Customs Union (SACU), Lesotho has the second highest stock of foreign reserves as a
percentage of GDP (Figure 1). 2 The substantial accumulation of reserves in recent years has been the
result of the authorities’ desire to support their exchange rate policy and to mitigate the impact of the
volatility of SACU revenues on the economy.3 As a result, reserves have been largely driven by the
fluctuations in the SACU receipts over time.
2.
Despite the decline during the recent global financial crisis, Lesotho’s foreign reserves
remained above the minimum threshold of the traditional metrics (3 months of import, 100 percent
of short-term debt, and 20 percent of broad money), as well as those for the ARA risk-weighted metrics
suggested in the 2011 IMF policy paper. Indeed, as of 2013, the stock of reserves represent almost
5 months of next year’s imports, 1.5 times broad money, 2 times M1, and 24.7 times short-term debt. The
risk-weighted approach suggests that the adequate level of reserves for Lesotho was between
US$411 million and US$616 million—roughly one-third to one-half actual reserves.

3.
To determine the optimal level of reserves for Lesotho, we applied a cost-benefit analysis
proposed by Dabla-Norris et al. (2011). In this framework, the optimal reserve level balances the
expected benefits of holding reserves against the opportunity cost associated with such holdings. In
order to simulate “worst case” conditions, shocks were applied to two

Under the recent ECF-supported program, the medium-term target for international reserves was five months of imports.

3

By virtue of its membership of the Common Monetary Area (CMA), the Lesotho loti, is pegged one-for-one to the South African rand.
CMA members are required to maintain net international reserves (NIR) of at least 100 percent of the narrow definition of money supply
(M1). The Central Bank of Lesotho, however, sets its floor at 120 percent of M1.

scenarios. In the first one, a “weak fiscal position”, we use the average of the fundamental and external
shock variables over the past five years (2009–13). In the second scenario, a “strong fiscal position”,
forward looking projections over the period 2014–18 are used. Since, Lesotho is not heavily dependent
on foreign aid, the foreign aid shocks are set at zero (Table 1).
4.
Given Lesotho’s large infrastructure investment needs, the opportunity costs of reserve
holdings could be relatively high

5.
It should be noted, however, that this estimated optimal level constitutes a lower bound
for precautionary motives that can be rationalized in terms of self-insurance against adverse
potential external shocks faced by the country. Furthermore, since Lesotho has limited access to
international markets and it is difficult to ascertain the opportunity costs of holding reserves due to the
low implementation capacity for investment projects, the country may aim for a level of reserves beyond
this estimated level.

Appendix II. Lesotho: External Stability Assessment1
Exchange Rate Assessment
1.
Based on the methodologies adopted by CGER2 and applying updated coefficients from the
relevant econometric models, the exchange rate assessment exercise suggests that the Loti is broadly in
line with medium term fundamentals.
2.
Under the macroeconomic balance approach, the current account balance norm (as modeled
by the determinants of the country’s savings and investment in medium run equilibrium) has been
identified at -6.2 percent of nominal output, while, the underlying current account balance (as
determined by the exports and imports functions of the current real effective exchange rate) was at
-6.1 percent, implying that the real exchange rate is in line with equilibrium.
3.
Under the equilibrium real exchange rate approach, the current real exchange rate appears to
be undervalued by about 16 percent. This test places higher degree of significance on relative
government consumption and remittance inflows as compared to other indicators (such as terms of
trade, relative productivity, aid inflows) in determining the medium run equilibrium real effective
exchange rate (REER). The current high levels of government consumption (due in part to high level of
SACU revenue transfers) and remittance inflows in the case of Lesotho skew the equilibrium towards
undervaluation. In the long run, more moderate inflows from SACU and remittances would imply a
smaller deviation of the REER from the long run equilibrium REER.
4.
Under the external sustainability approach, the degree of undervaluation of the real exchange
rate is estimated at about 5 percent, indicating that the present ratio of the current account balance to
nominal output is broadly consistent with the norm for the ratio of the net foreign asset position to
nominal output, which is determined based on the recently observed values.
5.
Of the three methods, the most reliable for Lesotho is deemed to be the macroeconomic
balance approach, which suggests that the exchange rate is in line with the medium term macroeconomic
fundamentals.

Competitiveness Assessment
6.
Given that the Loti is hard-pegged to the South African Rand and due to strong economic
ties of Lesotho to South Africa, real effective
exchange rate changes are largely driven by
economic developments in South Africa. For
example, recent nominal depreciation of the Rand
(by about 20 percent in 2013) led to the depreciation
of the REER of the Loti by about 10 percent.
However, preliminary data suggest that exports have
not picked up as a result of the depreciation,
implying limited elasticity of exports to exchange
rate changes. This could be explained by the
structural impediments that constrain export
competitiveness of the Lesotho’s economy.
7.
Lesotho continues to be lacking a viable private sector,
capable of competing regionally and internationally. The
National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) identified an
“uncompetitive business environment” as one of the most binding
constraints on the growth of private enterprises, adversely
affecting both FDI and local SMEs. The 2014 Doing Business
Report ranks Lesotho in the lower range of countries at 136th
place (out of 185), in particular indicating biggest problems in all
important stages of business – obtaining construction permits,
access to land and electricity, registering property, access to credit,
trading across borders with South Africa, and enforcing contracts.
For example, it may take more than two years for a foreigner to
establish a firm in Lesotho; it takes less than a year in such
countries as South Africa, Rwanda, and Vietnam.
8.
In recent years Lesotho has made important steps in
improving business climate, notably in streamlining the
process of registering a property and obtaining business
licenses. In particular, they have begun implementing the Land
Act of 2010, Land Administration Act of 2010, and the Companies
Act of 2010.

land access by investors. Lack of availability of factory shells
and serviced industrial sites has often been cited by potential investors as a constraint to
establishing a business in Lesotho. The Land Act of 2010 allows land subleasing (which could facilitate
provisioning of factory shells), but the act does not specify the rights of sub-lessees. The Government

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

37

KINGDOM OF LESOTHO

plans to submit to Parliament Amendments Land Bill to address this issue. The authorities have also
submitted to Parliament a Sectional Title Bill, which allows citizens to sell or transfer a section of their
property with an accompanying title for ownership.
10.
The Government is also taking measures to reduce the number of days to obtain a construction permit.
According to the World Bank (2013), it takes 330 days to obtain a construction permit, including 65 days
to obtain a building permit from the Maseru City Council (MCC) and another 180 days to request and
obtain telecommunications connections. The two most important bottlenecks in the process are getting
an environmental assessment for construction of buildings, which are 550 square meters or more, and
getting consent from the utility companies to issue a building permit. The Government has issued
regulations to require environmental impact assessments only for construction projects for industries that
pose high environmental risk, rather than for all projects. This would be in line with international best
practices, which recommend a risk-based approach. This single measure will shave 25 days off the
process of obtaining construction permits for most firms. For MCC building permits, the Government will
introduce streamlined procedures and an automated electronic workflow system to better integrate
approvals from various utility bodies.
11.
The process of starting a business in Lesotho has improved recently. According to the 2014
Doing Business, starting a business requires seven procedures, takes 29 days, and costs 11.4
percent of per capita income. Over the past few years, the Government has taken important steps to
reduce the number of days to start a business (down from 73 days in 2008); however, it is still high
compared to other countries. The new Industrial Licensing Act will facilitate and promote industrial
development and micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) through a new regulatory regime that is
simple, short, and cost effective. The Industrial Licensing Act reduces the time it takes to obtain a license
from five days to one day.
12.
Access to finance for SMEs is a severe constraint. Credit is largely provided through micro
lenders and informal mechanisms rather than formal financial institutions. With a view to increase
access to SMEs, the Central Bank of Lesotho is working on establishing a credit bureau, which is expected
to go live in June 2014. The establishment of a national identity system is crucial to setting up a credit
bureau. On June 2013, the Government launched the national ID system and currently covers about 5
percent of the population.
13.
Trading across borders has improved, and further reforms are being prepared. The time
required to import has fallen from 49 days in 2007 to 33 days in 2013, and to export from 44 days
in 2007 to 31 days in 2013. Despite the improvements, trade transactions costs are high. To improve
cross-border trading, the Government has drafted a Customs Modernization Strategy. It provides a
longer-term framework for coordinating and aligning customs-related activities, including the
introduction of an integrated border management approach to align numerous border agencies. With the
implementation of the strategy, which is planned for the end of 2014, the Government will reduce the
number of days for export and import clearances from 4.6 days to one.
14.
In addition to institutional impediments, the trade is constrained by the small size of
Lesotho’s economy and its very narrow export base, having to rely on diamonds and textiles as the

38

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KINGDOM OF LESOTHO

main sources of exports, which account for about 27 and 43 percent of total imports in 2012/13.
While domestic diamond industry has experienced a strong growth in recent years, it remains to be seen
whether this could be sustained and expanded to other natural resources. At the moment, as the country
intends to undertake a number of exploratory projects there are no significant identified deposits.
15.
Textile industry proved to be limited mainly to the exports to the US under the AGOA
arrangements, which is set to expire in 2015. In the absence of its extension, there is a significant risk
that the textile exports could sharply decline. In the past, uncertainties about the extension of this
arrangement led to the decline in production as investors awaited the political decision before making
longer-term investment plans. Amidst the lack of useful data on labor market and wages in Lesotho,
available research suggests that in addition to remote location of the country from main markets and key
disadvantages identified in the WB’s Doing Business Report, Lesotho lacks competitive advantage in the
labor market. A post-AGOA comparative study of Lesotho’s textile factories with seven similar factories in
Asia indicates that labor productivity is 30-70 (with average of 50) percent below in Lesotho than in Asia.
The industry is governed by a statutory minimum wage requirement, which played a role in recent rising
labor costs. For the past decade or so, the minimum wages have been set broadly indexed to the
domestic inflation.
16.
In addition, the country has arrangements with South Africa on the supply of water, which
contributed an additional 8 percent of total receipts from exports in 2012/13.
17.
In conclusion, while the real exchange rate appears to be broadly in line with medium term
fundamentals, numerous structural issues prevent the development of the private sector capable
of competing regionally and globally.

Safeguards Assessment
An update safeguards assessment of the Central Bank of Lesotho was completed in
November 2012 in connection with the augmentation of access under the ECF arrangement
approved in April 2012. The assessments confirmed that the CBL has taken steps to
strengthen safeguards since the 2010 assessment, but also that risks remain. In 2010, Deloitte
(South Africa) was appointed as the CBL's external auditor. The firm has since completed the
audits of financial years 2010, 2011, and 2012 within the three-month statutory deadline and
issued an unqualified audit opinion following each audit. Since the 2012 assessment, aspects
of the monetary data reporting process have been strengthened with IMF technical
assistance.
Exchange arrangement:
Lesotho is a member of the Common Monetary Area (CMA) and the Lesotho loti is both de
facto and de jure pegged at par to the South African Rand, which is also legal tender in the
country. Lesotho has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the
Articles of Agreement and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making
of payments and transfers for current international transactions. Staff is currently assessing
whether certain exchange measures maintained by Lesotho and recently identified by LEG are
consistent with Article VIII of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement. As of March 31, 2014, the
maloti rate per U.S. dollar was M10.2.
Article IV consultation:
The 2012 Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on April 19, 2012.
Lesotho is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle.
Technical assistance
The Fund has been providing Lesotho with technical assistance and training to help
authorities strengthen their capacity to design and implement effective policies. Technical
assistance covers wide range of areas in macroeconomic, fiscal, and monetary. Specific
technical assistance projects since 2008 are the following:

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance with some key data shortcomings in fiscal and external sector
statistics.
National Accounts: Bureau of Statistics (BOS) compiles and reports national accounts statistics on an annual basis. Statistical
methods used to derive GDP have improved and new sources of data were developed, although serious challenges remain.
National accounts were revised and rebased in 2008 and 2009. New sources of data, including VAT records, the 2008 labor
force survey, 2010-11 household budget survey, household consumption surveys, and ongoing economic census (business
survey) have improved the quality of the national accounts. Annual GDP estimates in current prices and volume terms from
the production, expenditure, and income sides are currently produced and published by the BLS. Other macroeconomic
indicators, such as high-frequency industrial production/trade indices, are used to monitor developments during the year.
The source data needs to be improved by developing high quality data on intermediate consumption for key economic
activities, intra-SACU exports and imports, and gross fixed capital formation in machinery and equipment, and formal and
informal construction activities. Private consumption and gross fixed capital formation are now estimated within the
framework of a supply and use table, although a discrepancy between supply and use leads to a discrepancy between GDP
by activity and expenditure. BOS, with the help of Fund’s TA, intends to begin compiling quarterly national account series.
Price Statistics: The official monthly consumer price index (CPI), a composite of urban and rural price data, is available on a
timely basis. The index has been re-referenced to March 2010=100, using 2002/03 Household Budget Survey. The work on
developing producer and export price indices is ongoing. In the meantime, the national accounts rely on South Africa’s
producer price index and import price indices, used as deflators for imports from SACU- and non-SACU countries,
respectively.
Government Finance Statistics (GFS): The compilation of GFS is consistent with GFSM 2001, although the quality, timelines,
and periodicity of data have shortcomings. GFS are not provided on a regular basis and the quality of data remains poor, as
indicated by significant discrepancies between transactions above and below the line. GFS are compiled from the Integrated
Financial Management Information System (IFMIS), supplemented with data from the Lesotho Revenue Authority (LRA), other
government departments and units and the banking system. Teething problems experienced with phasing in the IFMIS and
in the absence of monthly reconciliation of all Treasury accounts, the coverage of revenue and expenditure data could be
incomplete The authorities have been working with international partners, including the EU, the World Bank, and FAD on
improving the functionality of the IFMIS and launching monthly reconciliation of all Treasury accounts. GFS is compiled for
central government and general government statistics are not available.
Monetary and Financial Statistics (MFS): The Central Bank of Lesotho (CBL) reports monetary data on a regular basis based
on Standardized Report Forms (SRFs), with monthly data disseminated through the IFS. Improved data sources helped
improve classification and sectorization of accounts. The institutional coverage of MFS needs to be expanded to include
other depository and other financial corporations.
Financial sector surveillance: The CBL has begun the process of compiling FSIs on a consistent basis and started by
recreating consistent FSIs since 2006. FSIs on depository corporations are reported on a quarterly basis with a lag. However,
FSIs on non-financial corporations, households, and real estate markets are not available. A recent mission visited Maseru
during April 7–April 11, 2014 to assist CBL staff in the compilation of FSIs according to the FSIs Compilation Guide and work
with CBL staff to disseminate the FSI data and metadata on the IMF’s FSI website.
External Sector statistics: Lesotho benefited from technical assistance provided by STA on the compilation of external
sector statistics. Until recently, the CBL compiled and disseminated detailed quarterly balance of payments data in
accordance with BPM5. The April 2014 technical assistance mission assisted the CBL in converting the quarterly balance of
payments and international investment position (IIP) to the BPM6 framework, which eliminated a number of errors and
inconsistencies in data. From the subsequent release, data will be published under BPM6 format. External debt database
includes outstanding and contracted loans, their currency composition, debt service and amortization, as well as scheduled
future disbursements and debt servicing. The centralized database for external grants has not been regularly updated.
Data Standards and Quality
Lesotho is a GDDS participant. GDDS metadata have been posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board since
August 2003. Pending metadata updates in GDDS include those referring to recent/prospective revisions of the national
accounts, government finance, and balance of payments statistics.

DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS UPDATE
May 19, 2014

Approved By

Anne-Marie Gulde-Wolf
and Chris Lane (IMF);
Marcelo Giugale and
Jeffrey D. Lewis (IDA)

Prepared jointly by the staffs of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Development
Agency (IDA).

This debt sustainability analysis (DSA) updates the joint IMF/IDA DSA from September 2013. It
incorporates macroeconomic projections consistent with the government budget for 2014/15,
which was recently approved by parliament, and employs the 5 percent discount rate that is now
standard for present value calculations. Results indicate that Lesotho remains at moderate risk of
external debt distress. 1 However, these results are sensitive to the assumptions concerning the
financing of the hydropower plant under the second phase of the Lesotho Highlands Water
Project and projections of government’s annual financing needs. Given the low level of domestic
public debt, the debt indicator for total public debt remains well below its relevant benchmark.

1

The low-income country debt sustainability framework (LIC DSF) recognizes that better policies and
institutions allow countries to manage higher levels of debt, and thus the threshold levels are policydependent. Lesotho’s policies and institutions, as measured by the World Bank’s Country Policy and
Institutional Assessment (CPIA), place it as a “medium performer”, with an average rating of 3.45 during
2010-12. The relevant indicative thresholds for this category are: 40 percent for the present value (PV) of debtto-GDP ratio, 150 percent for the PV of debt-to-exports ratio, 250 percent for the PV of debt-to-revenue ratio,
20 percent for the debt service-to-exports ratio, and 20 percent for the debt service-to-revenue ratio. These
thresholds are applicable to public and publicly guaranteed external debt.

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
1.
Based on recent revisions to historical national accounts data and revised assumptions
concerning the timeline for construction of the water and hydropower components of the second
phase of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP-2), real GDP growth is projected to dip in 2014
before picking up over the medium term. On average, growth rates are slightly higher in 2015–17,
compared with projections for the previous DSA. Over the long term, the average annual growth rate was
revised downwards from 4.8 percent to 4.5 percent, mainly reflecting a lower share of capital spending in
the government’s budget. For imports, the underlying long-term trend anticipates a slight import
substitution effect with growth, while over the medium term increases in imports would outpace GDP
growth because of imported inputs for LHWP-2 construction. Export growth over the medium term is
largely determined by expected developments in the mining and manufacturing sectors. Over the long
term exports would receive a boost from the completion of LHWP-2.

Projections

2018 2019-33
Average

2.
On the fiscal side, the government revenue (excluding grants) was revised upward on
average by 2 percent of GDP a year over the long run, largely reflecting higher revenue projections
from the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) – compared with projections in the previous DSA.
Primary (noninterest) expenditure projections have also been increased to reflect the latest projections in
the authorities’ medium-term fiscal framework, resulting in an average primary deficit of 4.3 percent of GDP
per annum, which is assumed to be financed mostly through external concessional borrowing.
3.
The assumptions regarding the hydropower component of LHWP-2 remain broadly the
same as those in the previous DSA with respect to costs ($500 million) and financing terms and
conditions (80 percent commercial, 20 percent grants). Only the timeline has been pushed back to
2019–26, in light of recent delays.2 However, these assumptions are tentative as the project’s feasibility

2

As before, construction under the water component is expected to begin in 2014-15 and would run through
2021/22. The total cost of this component (US$900 million) will be financed by grants from South Africa.

study is still underway (expected to be completed by end-2014). The actual size of the project could be
larger and the terms of the financing could differ.
4.

In line with the current policy, this update also uses a discount rate of 5 percent.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
A. Baseline
5.
All external debt sustainability indicators remain below their corresponding thresholds in
the baseline scenario (Table 1a). For example, the present value (PV) of external debt to GDP ratio is
expected to fall to below 30 percent in 2016, after which time it is expected to rise to 39 percent in 2022,
before subsiding to 34 percent in the early 2030s. The temporary rise in the debt ratio is driven by the
construction of a hydropower plant under LHWP-2 and related financing needs. Moreover, in the long run
the looser fiscal outlook (higher primary deficits) raises the PV of external debt to GDP ratio by more than
10 percent of GDP, compared with the previous DSA.
6.
These results are sensitive to the assumptions concerning the amount and concessionality of
LHWP-2 financing, the future of SACU revenues, and the concessionality of external borrowing in
general. The temporary increase in PV of external debt to GDP ratio is driven entirely by higher
nonconcessional borrowing for the LHWP-2. The increased borrowing during the construction of the
power plant does make Lesotho temporarily more vulnerable to external shocks. The authorities are
currently undertaking a feasibility study, results of which would provide a better idea about the financing
options. While the baseline assumes that the government revenue would gradually decline from 56 percent
of GDP in 2014 to 48 percent of GDP in 2023 and onwards, largely due to a decline in SACU revenue, a
more abrupt and permanent decline of these revenues—as discussed in the risk assessment matrix in the
staff report for Lesotho’s Article IV consultation (EBS/14/[ ])—would require a major fiscal adjustment to
maintain macroeconomic stability rather than additional borrowing.

B. Sensitivity Analysis
7.
Stress tests show that Lesotho’s external debt vulnerabilities would increase significantly, in
particular in the event of a worsening of borrowing terms, a major exchange rate depreciation, or if
the export growth turned out to be lower than the historical average. (Table 1b). A 200 basis point
increase in interest rates for new public sector loans in 2013–33 (A2) would increase the PV of external
debt-to-GDP ratio to 55 percent in 2024 and beyond. Similarly, in the event of a one-time 30 percent
depreciation of the nominal exchange rate (B6) in 2014, the PV of external debt-to-GDP ratio would
increase to 55 percent by 2021/22, gradually falling thereafter to 50 percent by 2028 and staying at about
48 percent thereafter. In both of these stress tests, the 40-percent threshold would be breached
throughout the projection period. In a scenario where export value grows (B2) at one standard deviation
lower than the historical average, the PV of external debt-to-export ratio would rise from 2018 and peak in
2021 at 142 percent, before easing to 100 percent in 2030s. In a scenario in which the key variables are set
at their average of the past 10 years, Lesotho’s external debt ratios actually fall relative to the baseline,
reflecting an average fiscal surplus over the past years thanks to the large SACU revenue in 2006–09.
However, given the structural break, the historical scenario could be considered less relevant for the
analysis.

C. Including Remittances3
8.
When remittances are included in the analysis, a key external debt indicator would be
briefly breached, albeit by a small margin. (Figure 2). The PV of external debt to GDP plus remittances
ratio is expected to fall to 28 percent by 2017, after which time it is expected to rise, reaching nearly
36½ percent in 2021–23 (the relevant threshold is 36 percent), and then fall to 32 percent by the end of
the projection period. Other indicators behave similarly to the analysis excluding remittances.

PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
9.
Public debt indicators largely mirror those of external debt, because domestic debt remains
low throughout the projection period (2–4 percent of GDP). Domestic debt is projected to fall to about
2 percent of GDP by 2018/19, and thereafter to gradually increase to about 4 percent of GDP in 2032/33.
The PV of public sector debt stood at 37 percent in 2012/13.
10.
The standard sensitivity tests for public debt distress point to higher degree of vulnerability
of public debt to lower long-run GDP growth (Table 2b). In the case of permanently lower GDP growth
(A3) the PV of debt to GDP ratio would increase permanently throughout the projection period to
56 percent. The permanently-lower-GDP-growth test has a similar effect on the PV of debt-to-revenue and
debt service-to-revenue ratios.

CONCLUSION
11.
Lesotho remains at moderate risk of external debt distress. All external debt and debt service
indicators for the base case remain below their respective thresholds. However, there is a permanent
breach in the sensitivity tests. Compared with the previous DSA, the primary fiscal deficit has deteriorated
throughout the projection period by an average of about 4 percent of GDP a year, increasing the PV of
external debt to GDP ratio by 12 percentage points at the end of the projection period. The risks appear
manageable, provided that the fiscal stance does not deteriorate further and that government’s external
borrowing is largely on concessional terms. Uncertainty about the parameters of the LHWP-2 project and
its financing could also create some risk to debt sustainability. For the next DSA, these parameters should
be updated based on the conclusions of the project’s feasibility study currently underway.
12.
The authorities broadly agreed with the assessment of moderate risk of external debt
distress. They appreciated that the PV of external debt ratio rises owing to the construction of the LHWP-2
and agreed that care would be needed to ensure that the financing arrangements do not increase the risk
of external debt distress.

3

Presenting the analysis including remittances is mainly for illustrative purposes. With declining migrant employment
in South Africa’s mining sector, Lesotho’s dependence on remittances continues to diminish. In the long term, the
ratio of remittances to GDP is expected to fall well below 10 percent.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and
ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments.
For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

level after the shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 5, 2014

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with
the Kingdom of Lesotho
On June 4, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Kingdom of Lesotho. 1
Background
Since 2010, the economy performed well with the growth of real Gross Domestic Product
averaging over 5 percent a year and inflation held to single-digit levels. International reserves
have recovered to close to 5 months of import coverage after dipping to 3½ months of imports in
2012 in the wake of the balance of payments and fiscal crisis caused by the sharp drop in
revenues from the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) in fiscal years 2010/11 and
2011/12. The recovery from the crisis was achieved with the help of a sustained fiscal adjustment
effort supported by the IMF with a three-year arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility
(ECF), which was successfully concluded in September 2013.
The economic outlook for Lesotho is positive with strong economic growth and low inflation.
Economic activity is expected to be supported by large public investment projects, including the
second phase of Lesotho Highland Water Project. The authorities are also taking steps to
strengthen the role of the private sector. However, there are risks, most notably from the high
volatility of SACU revenues.
Despite the recent strong growth, unemployment remains high and poverty is widespread, while
some social indicators on primary and secondary education and HIV/AIDS highlight the future
challenges.
In the near term, the authorities are faced with the issue of domestic tax performance. In
2013/14, the domestic tax revenue experienced a shortfall of 4 percent of GDP and resulted in
the overall fiscal deficit of more than 1 percent of GDP, compared with a strong surplus the
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

previous year. On the spending side, Lesotho is faced with an extraordinarily high government
wage bill—the highest in sub-Saharan Africa (relative to GDP)—which to some extent crowds
out public investment projects needed to promote inclusive growth under the National Strategic
Development Plan (NSDP).
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended Lesotho’s robust economic growth with moderate
inflation, and welcomed the recovery of international reserves on the back of a period of fiscal
adjustment. The outlook is positive, but the economy faces risks from the volatility of revenues
from the Southern African Customs Union, while unemployment remains high and poverty
widespread. A strengthening of fiscal policies and stepped up reform implementation will
therefore be needed to enhance resilience and promote private sector-led inclusive growth.
Directors saw a need for a tighter fiscal stance consistent with maintaining an adequate
level of international reserves and creating space for priority social and capital spending. They
encouraged the authorities to improve revenue administration and tax policy, including in
mining, and to contain recurrent expenditure, notably the wage bill. In this regard, Directors
urged completion of the ongoing pilot payroll audits and extension of the exercise to the entire
civil service while strengthening control over hirings. They also encouraged the authorities to
step up public financial management reforms.
Directors noted that substantial financing will be needed for the second phase of the
Lesotho Highlands Water Project, and encouraged the authorities to pursue a prudent debt policy
to ensure sustainability. They recommended prompt submission of the new public debt
management bill to parliament.
Directors observed that the loti’s peg to the South African rand has successfully anchored
Lesotho’s macroeconomic stability. They encouraged the authorities to consider moving toward
a transparent and predictable rules-based fiscal framework, which, in addition to maintaining a
sufficient stock of international reserves to secure the peg, would further reduce risks.
Directors welcomed the soundness of the banking sector. They emphasized the need for
financial sector deepening to enable private sector-led growth, and recommended further
strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework, including effective cross-border
supervision with South Africa, and establishing a functional credit reference bureau.
Implementation of the Financial Sector Development Strategy will be important in this regard.

2

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors encouraged the authorities to step up implementation of the National Strategic
Development Plan to improve the business climate, raise competitiveness, and promote
broad-based growth and poverty reduction.

Statement by Mr. Momodou Bamba Saho, Executive Director
for the Kingdom of Lesotho
June 4, 2014
The Lesotho authorities are appreciative of the constructive engagement they shared with
staff during 2014 Article IV consultation in January 2014.
Lesotho’s economic performance remained significantly healthy despite being hit by severe
shocks in 2009/10. Sound economic management prior to the global financial crisis provided
sufficient policy space for the authorities in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.
Following the crisis, government revenue from the Southern African Customs Union
(SACU), which had previously accounted for about half of total government revenue, fell to
about 30 percent of total revenue (about 15 percent of GDP) in 2010/11 and 2011/12 . In
response the budget deficit increased to 5 percent of GDP in 2010/11 and almost 11 percent
of GDP in 2011/12.
Despite the deterioration in the fiscal position that was driven by the decline in SACU
revenue, the authorities were able to maintain the loti (domestic currency) peg to the South
African rand and overall macroeconomic stability. This was made possible largely by strong
accumulation of international reserves prior to the crisis that stood at over 5 months of
imports in 2009/10. The authorities’ prudent policies received a boost from the Fundsupported ECF arrangement in June 2010 and were subsequently reinforced by a rebound in
SACU revenue, which rose from 15 percent to 30 percent of GDP in 2012/13.
Against this background, while the authorities and staff largely share similar policy concerns,
several issues in the staff report need further clarity. The rest of this statement is devoted to
clarifying some of these issues; and follows up with a brief summary of the authorities’
policy priorities as set out in the budget speech that was presented to Parliament on February
20, 2014.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
Despite a history of solid macroeconomic performance, the authorities share staff’s concern
about the need for a gradual rebuilding of international reserves to create space for increased
investment spending. However, the gloomy picture painted in the staff report, particularly in
the appraisal section, is not consistent with Lesotho’s strong macroeconomic performance.
Hence, it is difficult to justify on the basis of the data and the authorities’ reform efforts,
staff’s assessment that “progress toward a sound macroeconomic policy framework stalled in
2013/14, due to fiscal slippages”. For example, Table 3 of the main staff report shows a
budget deficit for 2013/14 as 1.2 percent of GDP and, according to Table 5, gross
international reserves were estimated at 4.8 months of imports. These data compare much
favorably with their levels in 2010/11 and 2011/12, with fiscal deficits of 5 percent and 10.6
percent of GDP and reserve coverage of 4 months and 3.6 months of imports, respectively.
Furthermore, it is hard to justify the basis for staff’s suggestion that the recently approved
budget (with a deficit of 1.8 percent of GDP) has loosened the fiscal stance too far. As

2
explained in the Budget Speech by the Minister of Finance to Parliament on February 20,
2014, proposals for 2014/15 budget allocations were, to the extent possible, based on their
potential to contribute towards (a) facilitating job creation, inclusive growth and economic
diversification; (b) reducing economic and social vulnerabilities; and (c) improving public
sector delivery and efficiency. It is expected that future budgets will become progressively
tighter as low priority activities are weeded out. Supported by ongoing public financial
management reforms, these efforts have the potential to further improve Lesotho’s fiscal
position.
In addition, at the time of the Article IV mission, the authorities were already pursuing
various reform measures that were aimed at improving the fiscal position, by controlling
increases in current expenditure to create room for increased capital spending going forward.
These measures included the payroll audit of the civil service that was being piloted in the
three largest ministries. As indicated in the staff report, the authorities’ intention was to,
subsequently, extend the audit to other government ministries.
According to the staff report, in paragraph 3, “poor implementation of the National Strategic
Development Plan (NSDP), which was officially launched in 2012, has weakened the fight
against poverty.” However, the implementation of the NSDP has been delayed mainly on
account of resource shortages. In addition, as was re-emphasized during the staff visit in
January, the authorities have been working on measures to strengthen their capacity to plan,
evaluate and execute projects. In this context, the Government of Lesotho, in partnership
with the IMF, held a consultative conference on January 27, 2014. The conference, which
was attended by various stakeholders, aimed at informing the country’s development agenda
and refocusing structural reforms towards sustainable and inclusive growth. Moreover, as
highlighted in the 2014/15 Budget Speech, the authorities remain concerned that economic
progress achieved thus far has not translated into job creation and poverty reduction and are
committed to addressing these challenges.
The authorities have repeatedly expressed their desire for leaner and more efficient civil
service, to improve government’s ability to deliver services to the citizens. However, the
point made by staff in paragraph 3 that the size of the wage bill is driven, in part, by
“political pressure to expand employment” is inaccurate. In contrast, in Lesotho, the
government is the largest formal employer because the private sector is relatively small and
unable to absorb the skilled workforce. In addition, wages in Lesotho are driven in part by
competition for skilled labor in South Africa, the region’s largest economy.
Financial Sector Developments
The financial system remains sound and adequately capitalized, and the authorities remain
committed to enhancing financial sector stability. To mitigate risks presented by the nonbank sector, the authorities will continue to expand supervision and oversight of the sector. In
this context, the passage of the insurance act by Parliament has been a step in the right
direction.

3
The authorities also welcome staff's recommendation to deepen the financial sector. Hence
the implementation of the Financial Sector Development Strategy will be critical for the
achievement of this objective. However, it is important to note that the dominant role of
South African banks and the funding links they share with their parent banks have tended to
depress demand for an inter-bank market in Lesotho.
National Strategic Development Plan 2012/13 – 2016/17
Promotion of peace, democratic governance and building of effective institutions is only one
of the six strategic goals of the NSDP. While the authorities acknowledge that, like in many
other developing countries, there is always room for improvement of democratic institutions
and processes, it is not clear why staff describes Lesotho’s history of political transitions
difficult. Nonetheless, political transitions in Lesotho, at least since the restoration of multiparty democracy in 1993, have often not resulted in significant macroeconomic policy
changes. More importantly, as it may be recalled, the coalition government came to power,
following the national elections in May 2012, at the time when Lesotho was in the middle of
an ECF arrangement with the Fund. Contrary to expectations, the coalition government kept
policy commitments made by the previous administration under the ECF, despite an
expanded cabinet that had a potential to put pressure on financial resources. Therefore, any
perceived fears that a potential collapse of the coalition government will result in significant
changes in government policies are misplaced. Furthermore, we are surprised by staff’s
assertion that the coalition government’s “slim majority in the National Assembly adds to the
challenge of policy making” as there is no clear evidence of this claim.
On the whole, the authorities consider political assertions made in paragraph 4 difficult to
substantiate. For example, it is not clear why the introduction of performance contracts for
cabinet ministers, intended to improve service delivery by government ministries, is
attributed by staff to efforts to reduce corruption.
Policy Priorities for 2014/15
In 2014/15, the authorities will continue to pursue policy priorities that are consistent with
the NSDP and the National Vision 2020. These priorities will put particular emphasis on
economic transformation to promote sustainable and broad-based growth and reduce poverty.
Specifically, as detailed in the budget speech, efforts will be geared towards (a) facilitating
job creation, inclusive growth and economic diversification; (b) creating enabling investment
climate and regulatory framework; (c) development of a minimum infrastructure platform;
and (d) improving public sector efficiency and effectiveness. Thus, interventions implied in
the budget proposals for 2014/15 are based on their potential to contribute toward these broad
objectives.
