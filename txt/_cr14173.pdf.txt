STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. The economy is steadily recovering from a substantial slowdown in 2012–13,
helped by improving conditions in main trading partners and a rebound in job creation
and household consumption. Financial markets and the zloty have stayed relatively
stable amidst renewed global financial market turmoil. Going forward, growth is
expected to continue to strengthen, though external risks remain on the downside.
Interconnectedness. Strong interconnectedness with Europe through both trade and
financial linkages has served Poland well, but makes it susceptible to growth shocks from
Europe. Poland’s open capital account exposes it to changes in investor sentiment,
including those resulting from a rise in geopolitical tensions surrounding Russia and
Ukraine. The latter could also affect Poland through trade and energy links.
Monetary policy. Monetary policy is at a challenging juncture: inflation is well below the
target, but the recovery is strengthening. While monetary policy has appropriately
remained on hold, the Monetary Policy Council should stand ready to further cut rates if
the recovery falters or inflation fails to pick up.
Fiscal policy. After a cyclical deterioration in the headline deficit to 4.3 percent of GDP
in 2013, fiscal consolidation is projected to resume in 2014. Additional moderate fiscal
consolidation would be needed in 2015–16 to reach the authorities’ medium-term
objective and put public debt on a stronger downward path. Ongoing pension changes
are expected to result in a long-term improvement of fiscal aggregates, but will be
matched by an increase in gross implicit pension liabilities.
Financial sector policy. The financial sector weathered the recent slowdown well and
remains well-capitalized, liquid, and profitable. While credit growth is picking up,
nonperforming loans (NPLs) remain high. Hence, tackling legal obstacles and tax
disincentives to resolving NPLs remains a priority. Work to establish the macroprudential
framework and bank resolution regime should be finalized.
Structural reforms. Boosting potential growth will require pressing ahead with reforms
of the labor market to address duality and the business environment to boost
investment.

CONTEXT
1.
The Polish economy experienced a substantial growth slowdown in 2012–13, but is
now recovering. Growth dropped in the second half of 2012 and into 2013 as uncertain prospects
for euro area growth weighed on confidence, adding to a contraction in public investment. As a
result of the slowdown and external factors (such as subdued energy prices), inflation fell sharply
below the target range. A recovery is now underway as the economy expanded by a higher-thanexpected 3.4 percent (yoy) in the first quarter of 2014.
2.
Poland weathered bouts of emerging market volatility in 2013 and early 2014
relatively well. Strong fundamentals, combined with very strong policies and the insurance
provided by the Flexible Credit Line (FCL) arrangement, helped support favorable financial market
perceptions amidst Fed tapering and geopolitical tensions surrounding Russia and Ukraine.
3.
Poland is highly interconnected with global markets through trade and financial links.
Poland’s integration with Europe—including through participation in the German supply chain—has
served it well, supporting income convergence and higher living standards. However, its high
interconnectedness also makes it susceptible to external shocks, including those emanating from
Europe, Russia/Ukraine, and global capital markets.


Trade. Europe remains Poland’s main export destination (in 2011, about ⅔ of the domestic
value added content of Poland’s exports was consumed in Europe). Efforts to enter new
markets in Eastern Europe (as a result of recent weak demand in Western Europe) led to an
increase in the share of gross exports finally consumed in this region to around 15 percent in
2011, of which Russia accounted for 6 percentage points.



Foreign direct investment. In 2012, close to 90 percent of the stock of inward foreign
direct investment (representing around 40 percent of GDP) originated from the European
Union, while exposure to Russian and Ukrainian FDI is small. Though corporate external debt
is high relative to peers, vulnerabilities are mitigated by intercompany loans, which account
for more than 50 percent of total corporate external debt.



Financial. Poland’s banking system is largely foreign-owned with foreign claims of BIS
reporting banks amounting to close to 60 percent of GDP, of which more than 80 percent is
accounted for by euro area banks. However, reliance on parent funding has declined in
recent years and is moderate.



Capital markets. Poland’s open capital account makes it susceptible to spillovers arising
from shifts in investor sentiment, including possibly from a sharp increase in geopolitical
tensions surrounding Russia and Ukraine or global volatility arising from the normalization

of U.S. monetary policy. The increase in the share of foreign investors in the domestic bond
market, induced by recent pension changes, could exacerbate these risks.1

4.
With elections approaching next year, momentum for reforms is waning. Presidential
elections are scheduled to take place in summer 2015, followed by parliamentary elections in the
autumn. The appetite for significant reforms is very limited, given the election cycle and the ruling
coalition’s slim parliamentary majority.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
A. The Economy is Steadily Recovering
5.
The economy is recovering from the 2012–13 slowdown. It grew by 1.6 percent in
2013—the same as in 2009—as the slowdown in core euro area countries and adverse confidence
effects weighed on private investment and consumption, alongside a contraction in public
investment. A gradual, but balanced and steady recovery started in the second quarter of last year,
led by improving conditions in main trading partners (especially the euro area) and a recovery in
domestic demand. More recently, household consumption has continued to strengthen along with a
pick-up in retail sales growth, rising confidence, low borrowing costs, and increasing real wages. The
manufacturing PMI has been in expansionary territory since July 2013, and capacity utilization is at a
post-crisis peak (Figure 1 and Table 1).
6.
Labor market conditions have improved, but unemployment remains high. After
reaching a six-year peak of 10.6 percent in early 2013, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate
started to decline. A pick-up in job creation in the export-oriented manufacturing sector helped

overall employment growth turn positive at the end of the year (Figure 2). However, at close to
10 percent (sa), the unemployment rate remains high and dominated by structural factors.

7.
Inflation remains subdued and well below the target. Despite the strengthening
recovery, inflation has remained muted. At 0.3 percent (yoy) in April, it is significantly below the
lower band of the target range (2.5 percent ± 1 percentage point) and core inflation (excluding food
and energy) is also weak (0.8 percent in April) (Figure 3). The low inflation readings appear to reflect
a combination of low imported inflation, including from energy prices, and domestic factors (weak
demand in 2013, favorable weather conditions for crops in 2014, and one-offs, including reductions
in electricity tariffs, may still be weighing on prices). While consumer inflation expectations are
highly adaptive, consensus forecasts of professional forecasters remain well anchored.
8.
The current account balance continued to improve and the external position remained
consistent with medium-term fundamentals. At 1.3 percent of GDP in 2013, the current account
deficit narrowed to its lowest level in more than 15 years as the trade balance turned positive for the
first time in two decades (and remained positive in the first quarter of 2014), partly on account of
higher export market shares outside the euro area (Figure 4 and Table 2). External debt is high and
gross external financing needs substantial, but this is in large part related to intercompany debt and
parent bank funding (Annex I). While they have increased recently, net errors and omissions remain
below the EU average of around 2 percent of GDP. Poland’s external position is consistent with
medium-term fundamentals (Box 1).
9.
Financial markets have been resilient to Fed tapering jitters and geopolitical tensions
surrounding Russia and Ukraine, despite capital outflows. Net portfolio and, for the first time in
more than two decades, FDI flows were modestly negative in 2013 amid bouts of volatility in
financial markets. Yet, on the back of strong fundamentals, sound policies, and the insurance
provided by the FCL arrangement with the IMF, sovereign bond yields have remained low by
historical standards and the zloty has been relatively stable (Figure 5). More recently, escalating
geopolitical tensions surrounding Russia and Ukraine contributed to additional, moderate, financial
market volatility. Although FDI was weak in 2013, this appears to reflect global trends as Poland’s
share in global FDI actually increased.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF POLAND

Box 1. External Sector Assessment
The external position is broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals and appropriate policies,
though potential vulnerabilities exist.
Current account. The current account deficit has narrowed substantially from 3.7 percent in 2012 to
1.3 percent at end-2013. The cyclically adjusted current account balance is broadly consistent with
fundamentals and desirable policies.
Real exchange rate. The real exchange rate is assessed to be broadly consistent with fundamentals and
desirable policy settings. Alternative approaches suggest a modest undervaluation of between 0 and
8 percent (there is no estimated undervaluation using the current account norm; the estimated
undervaluation using the ES estimate of the real effective exchange rate (REER) gap is 8 percent; and the
estimated undervaluation using the REER regression approach is 5 percent). Nonetheless, some further
reduction in the structural fiscal deficit and current account deficit would be appropriate. The zloty has
fluctuated along relatively narrow margins.
Capital and financial account. Financial flows have weakened, particularly in the domestic bond market,
following Fed tapering-related announcements in May 2013. FDI flows have also weakened as a result of
income repatriation, while EU funds—which finance the bulk of the current account—have remained stable.
Although part of the decline in net FDI inflows was associated with one-off factors, going forward, financing
of the widening current account could prove challenging should net FDI inflows fall significantly below
current projections.
Foreign asset and liability position. Substantial net IIP liabilities have stabilized and stood at 69 percent of
GDP in 2013. Associated vulnerabilities are mitigated by the large and diversified share of FDI liabilities and
related intercompany lending (over 40 percent of foreign liabilities are FDI investments).
Reserve adequacy. Reserves are broadly adequate at about 126 percent of the IMF’s composite reserve
adequacy metric and 100 percent of short-term debt at remaining maturities (90 percent of short-term debt
at remaining maturities plus the current account deficit). However, in light of downside external risks
stemming from the normalization of U.S. monetary policy and geopolitical tensions surrounding Ukraine,
and in preparation for an eventual exit from the FCL arrangement with the IMF, moderate reserve
accumulation would be prudent.

B. The Banking System Has Remained Resilient
10.
The largely foreign-owned banking system is well-capitalized, profitable, and liquid
with declining reliance on external funding (Figures 6 and 7). Capital to risk-weighted assets has
remained strong, reaching 15.6 percent at the end of the first quarter of 2014 (Tier 1 ratio at
14.1 percent), in large part due to retained earnings. Profits have held up and liquidity indicators
have remained robust. Reliance on parent funding has declined, on-balance sheet open foreign
currency positions have narrowed, and regulatory changes to curb foreign currency credit growth
have led to a halt in foreign currency mortgage lending. Nonetheless, a loan-to-deposit ratio above
110 percent and reliance on swaps to fund the legacy stock of foreign currency mortgages could
expose the sector to liquidity risks (Table 3).

11.
Credit expansion is strengthening. Both corporate and consumer credit are expanding,
reflecting an increase in demand. In addition, for consumer loans, regulatory changes that eased
documentation requirements for small loans and replaced caps on the debt-service-to-income
threshold (instead allowing banks to use their internal models) likely helped support the expansion
of credit. For small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the de minimis program on government
credit guarantees was expanded to cover investment financing. NPLs, at around 8.5 percent of loans,
have begun to inch down but appear notably sticky and are still elevated in the corporate sector.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
12.
The near-term economic outlook is for a continuing recovery. GDP growth is projected
to reach 3.3 percent in 2014, underpinned by a rebound in domestic demand. A strengthening labor
market and increasing real wages should boost private consumption, while rising credit growth and
improving financial conditions should support investment. External demand is expected to recover,
supported by stronger growth in Poland’s main trading partners. However, inflation is expected to
remain low, reaching only around 1 percent in 2014.
13.
Over the medium term, growth is expected to gradually reach its potential. GDP
growth is projected to accelerate to around 3.5 percent in 2015‒16. The absorption of Poland’s new
allotment of EU structural funds for 2014‒20 (euro 82 billion in current prices; the largest in the EU)
should provide an impulse to public and private investment, and job creation should further reduce
unemployment over the medium term. Hence, rising domestic demand is projected to continue to
gradually erode the net export contribution to growth, and the current account balance is expected
to widen to around 3 percent by 2016. Given the recent and projected strengthening of domestic
demand growth (which is highly correlated with inflation 2–3 quarters forward) and the narrowing
output gap, the baseline inflation path envisages a gradual rise toward the target. However, given
low imported inflation and a stable exchange rate vis-à-vis the euro—despite substantial policy
interest rate cuts last year—there are downside risks to the inflation forecast.
14.
Risks to the growth outlook have become more balanced but with external factors still
firmly on the downside (see also Table 4 with the Risk Assessment Matrix).

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF POLAND



Global financial conditions. A renewed worsening of global financial conditions could lead
to capital outflows and an increase in interest rates, not least amidst a normalization of U.S.
monetary policy (Box 2 and Chapter I of Selected Issues). An increase in the share of foreign
investors in the domestic bond market, induced by the recent pension changes (see Policy
Discussions, Section B), has heightened the risks stemming from a sudden reversal of capital
flows—either because of renewed bouts of emerging market volatility or because of rising
geopolitical tensions surrounding Russia and Ukraine. In addition, depending on the reliance
on variable rate debt, interest rate shocks could raise the share of corporate sector debt at
risk (Chapter II of Selected Issues).



Geopolitical tensions. Poland is exposed to Russia and Ukraine through energy and trade
links, while direct financial links are small (Box 3). Considering the significant gas and oil
imports from Russia, spillovers from geopolitical turmoil, reflected in disruption of gas and
oil supply to Poland, would severely affect gas-intensive industries. In addition, confidence
effects could result in renewed financial market volatility and capital outflows.



Slower trading partner growth. Poland remains vulnerable to a protracted period of
slower growth in the euro area due to its strong trade and financial linkages with core euro
area countries. Such a scenario would weaken growth in Poland through lower exports and
adverse confidence effects.



Domestic risks. On the upside, the absorption of EU funds could be more frontloaded than
projected, leading to an earlier pickup in investment.

15.
Risks to the inflation outlook are on the downside. Inflation could fail to pick up as
envisaged in the baseline—either on account of external factors (low imported inflation) or domestic
factors (entrenched low inflation expectations)—and remain low for a protracted period. In
particular, should prolonged low inflation among European trading partners (which could result in
continued low imported inflation if exchange rate adjustments do not offset it) materialize, domestic
demand may not be sufficient to pull inflation back toward the target as envisaged in the baseline.
Authorities’ views
16.
The authorities shared staff’s views on the outlook, and underscored that risks were
mainly external. They agreed that a broad-based recovery is underway and broadly concurred with
staff’s forecasts for growth and inflation. They nonetheless felt that Poland’s recovery hinged
importantly on a continued recovery in the euro area. On risks, the authorities agreed that a
protracted period of slow growth in Europe or a reversal in foreign investor sentiment—either
because of global financial conditions or geopolitical issues—posed the main risks. They
nonetheless felt that Poland was well-positioned to manage risks associated with reversals of
investor sentiment given its well-diversified investor base, strong fundamentals, sound policies, and
insurance provided by the FCL arrangement. On the potential for a sharp increase in geopolitical
tensions surrounding Russia and Ukraine, the authorities emphasized that the impact on Poland
would depend critically on the precise nature of the increase in tensions. They also noted that, even

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

REPUBLIC OF POLAND

if Poland avoided a significant adverse macroeconomic impact, particular sectors of the economy
(such as agriculture) could be affected.
Box 2. Global Financial Spillovers and the Role of the Investor Base1
Ample global liquidity in recent years has increased foreign participation in many EM government
bond markets. During the past decade, the foreign investor share in the Polish domestic government bond
market rose by about 11 percentage points to 32 percent at end-2013, while yields on long-term zlotydenominated government bonds declined by close to 230 basis points between 2004‒13.
Foreign financing could quickly reverse on account of external shocks. Poland weathered the bouts of
emerging market volatility in 2013 and early 2014 well. Nonetheless, cumulative capital outflows of about
$7.2 billion took place between June 2013 and March 2014 and yields increased by about 30 basis points.
Staff analysis suggests that high foreign participation and high investor base concentration in localcurrency government bond markets increase the sensitivity of yields to global financial shocks.
Specifically, when foreign participation increases beyond 30 percent and investor base concentration
increases above the median (0.2, based on a Herfindahl-Hirschman index), the transmission to yields of
global financial shocks is significantly amplified in EMs. For Poland, foreign participation at 32 percent is
above the foreign participation threshold, suggesting potentially significant spillovers in case of tightening
of financial conditions. However, the concentration of Poland’s investor (measuring 0.1 on the HerfindahlHirschman index) is more diversified than the median EM, suggesting greater resilience to shocks. As in
previous bouts of volatility, Poland’s strong fundamentals should also help dampen adverse financial
spillovers. These results should be interpreted with caution. First, the absence of data on the profile of
foreign investors (i.e. whether these are retail or institutional investors) holding EM local-currency bonds,
makes it difficult to generalize

Box 3. Poland’s Links to Russia and Ukraine
Poland imports significant natural gas and crude oil from Russia, but some factors mitigate the
potential impact of energy supply disruptions.


Russia supplies 57 percent of Poland’s gas consumption and 94 percent of its crude oil
consumption.



However, relative to other countries in the region, Poland’s reliance on gas in its primary energy
supply is limited: only around 13 percent of energy supply comes from natural gas, with most
provided by coal (56 percent) and crude oil (23 percent).



In Poland, natural gas is used most heavily by industry (60 percent), with households (25 percent)
and the electricity sector (11 percent) less reliant. In case of disruptions, gas-intensive industries,
such as chemical and metallurgy (which comprise about 3 percent of GDP), would be severely
affected.



There are some mitigating factors that could reduce the adverse impact of energy supply
disruptions on Poland. These include: (i) the end of the winter-heating season; (ii) gas inventories
(estimated at around 30 days of imports); (iii) the long-term gas contract with Gazprom (which helps
shield Poland from price hikes); and (iv) scope to import gas from Germany (rather than Eastern
European neighbors, although this would not help in the case of pan-European gas disruptions).
Looking ahead, Poland is in the process of building a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal, which is
expected to be operational in 2015.

Trade links with Russia and Ukraine are moderate.


Russia. About 5 percent of Poland's exports are to Russia (while imports from Russia represent
slightly over 10 percent of the total), and about 6 percent of Poland’s exports are finally consumed
in Russia. 7 percent of Polish food exports go to Russia and bans on these exports (such as the
recently imposed one on pork) could have adverse effects on Polish food processing and
agricultural sectors.



Ukraine. Trade links with Ukraine are modest: less than 3 percent of Polish exports go to Ukraine,
while Polish imports from Ukraine represent 1.3 percent of the total.

FDI links are weak. Polish FDI in Russia stands at 2.5 percent of total FDI abroad (0.3 percent of GDP), while
in Ukraine it is 1.9 percent (0.2 percent of GDP). Russia and Ukraine also have limited FDI positions in Poland.
Direct financial linkages are limited, but indirect effects could be substantial. There are risks of
contagion through confidence effects and common investor linkages.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
17.
Amid continued external risks, Poland’s main policy challenge is to continue
adjustment while protecting the recovery. To support the recovery while continuing to rebuild
buffers, gradual fiscal consolidation is appropriate (Box 4). Monetary policy is at a challenging
juncture, with low inflation and a steady growth rebound. While keeping policy interest rates on
hold has been appropriate, further monetary easing may be needed if the recovery falters or
inflation fails to pick up. Considering the resilience of the financial sector, addressing obstacles and
disincentives to dealing with NPLs, completing the macroprudential framework, and revamping the
bank resolution framework are key priorities. Over the medium term, boosting potential growth will
require pressing ahead with reforms of the labor market and the business environment.

Box 4. Implementation of Past Fund Advice
Policy implementation has been broadly in line with past Fund advice:


Monetary policy. The Monetary Policy Council (MPC) continued the easing cycle to help counter
the downturn, followed by forward guidance to indicate that the key policy rate would remain
unchanged for an extended period. The legal framework is in the process of being strengthened,
with consideration of staggered terms of MPC members.



Fiscal policy. In response to the economic downturn, the pace of fiscal consolidation slowed in
structural terms, avoiding unwarranted drag on the economy. Meanwhile, the authorities have
remained committed to their medium-term objective (MTO), which is deemed adequate to rebuild
fiscal buffers. The permanent expenditure rule was approved and would be operational starting in
2015. Recent increases in the retirement age were consistent with Fund advice, but reform of the
special pension schemes still needs to be advanced.



Financial sector. The authorities have stepped up oversight of the small but vulnerable credit union
segment, initiating rehabilitation of a number of institutions. Work to establish a systemic risk board
(SRB) and new bank resolution framework has continued, though final legislation has been delayed.



Structural reforms. The authorities continued to reduce the number of regulated professions,
initiated legislation to lessen duality in the labor market, and adopted a law to improve the
functioning of public employment services. Ongoing work on the new insolvency regime is welcome
and should be concluded without delay. Progress to improve the business climate is commendable
and should be pursued further.

A. Monetary Policy: Addressing Low Inflation in the Face of External Risks
18.
Substantial cuts in policy interest rates last year helped ease financial conditions. The
key policy rate was lowered 225 basis points to a historical low of 2.5 percent between November
2012 and July 2013. This improved financial conditions and transmitted into lower lending rates,
suggesting that the monetary transmission mechanism is working (Figure 8 and Table 5). While
ending the easing cycle, the Monetary Policy Council (MPC) initiated forward guidance to maintain
rates at their current levels for an extended period (currently until at least the end of the third
quarter of 2014).
19.
While acknowledging the importance of
the past monetary easing, staff noted that
further cuts may be needed if the recovery
falters or inflation fails to pick up. Staff
emphasized that monetary policy is at a
challenging juncture: inflation remains well below
the target range, but economic activity is
strengthening and credit growth is rising.


Though inflation is very low, this appears
to partly reflect external factors as

time, the economy is steadily improving.



Monetary conditions remain supportive—lending rates have continued to decline and credit
growth is rising (and now stands at around 5 percent).



Given staff’s projection of strengthening domestic demand growth (which is highly
correlated with inflation 2–3 quarters forward) and the closing of the output gap in 2016,
inflation is projected to rise toward the target under current policies.



While the Monetary Policy Council has appropriately kept rates on hold, it should stand
ready to further reduce rates if the recovery falters or if revised projections indicate that
inflation would remain well below target for a protracted period (taking into account
monetary policy transmission lags). On the latter, second round effects from low energy
prices could weigh on core inflation, entrenching expectations of low inflation going
forward. To the extent that inflation remains low due to subdued imported inflation, further
rate cuts may also be associated with moderate zloty depreciation, which should help lift
imported inflation.

20.
Staff suggested that moderate reserve accumulation would be prudent. International
reserves at about 126 percent of the IMF’s composite reserve adequacy metric are broadly
adequate. However, in light of downside external risks—including from U.S. Fed tapering and
geopolitical tensions surrounding Russia and Ukraine—and in preparation for an eventual exit from
the FCL arrangement, moderate reserve accumulation would be prudent.
21.
In the event of severe external pressures, the exchange rate should be allowed to play
its appropriate cushioning role, taking into account its impact on the stock of foreign currency
mortgages. Intervention, including verbal, could be used to curb excess volatility. Meanwhile, the
NBP should continue to stand ready to ensure adequate zloty and FX liquidity in the banking sector.
To the extent that inflation fails to pick up, severe external pressures may limit the scope for policy
rate cuts.
Authorities’ views
22.
The authorities agreed that monetary policy faced challenges, but were more cautious
than staff regarding the potential for further lowering the policy rate. In particular, the
authorities felt that low inflation would primarily pose concerns if the recovery faltered. While they
agreed that part of the low inflation in Poland was imported or affected by one-off factors, they
viewed this as generally favorable as low food and energy prices could be having virtuous secondround effects (by lowering other prices) and thus boosting household purchasing power.
Nonetheless, the authorities were of the view that inflation would pick up along with growing
private consumption. On reserves, they agreed that moderate reserve accumulation would be
prudent.

B. Gradually Continuing Fiscal Consolidation
23.
The fiscal deficit widened in 2013 as a result of weak economic growth. The economic
slowdown took a toll on tax collections (including VAT, which has seen an unfavorable trend in
collection efficiency in the last five years (Chapter III of Selected Issues)). As a result, the deficit
widened from 3.9 percent of GDP in 2012 to 4.3 percent of GDP in 2013 (Tables 6 and 7). In late2013, the fiscal framework was overhauled with the approval of a permanent expenditure rule, which
will begin to take effect in 2015.2
24.
The gradual resumption of fiscal consolidation this year is appropriate given the
economic recovery underway. The 2014 budget

end-2014, largely on account of a one-off transfer
of public debt from the pension fund’s second pillar to the general government. As in previous
years, financing is comfortable: more than three-fourths of government 2014 financing needs have
already been covered.
25.
The recent changes to the pension system will improve the fiscal aggregates, but staff
underscored that maintaining fiscal prudence remains essential to further reduce public debt.
The changes to the pension system—which entail a downsizing of the second pillar—were
motivated by concerns about the performance and fiscal costs of the second pillar and have led to
criticism by some observers on property rights and policy continuity grounds (Box 5).The changes
are estimated to deliver an improvement in the fiscal accounts of around 30 percent of GDP in net
present value terms during 2014–60, matched by an increase in gross implicit pension liabilities
(Chapter IV of Selected Issues).3 The structural fiscal deficit should drop to 2 percent of GDP by 2016,
and public debt (ESA 95) is expected to fall to around 45 percent of GDP by 2019, helped by gradual
asset transfers from the pension system’s second pillar. However, staff noted that additional

A permanent expenditure rule was passed by parliament in late 2013 and will become operational in 2015. The new
rule links public expenditure growth to average GDP growth and requires additional expenditure consolidation
when the debt-to-GDP ratio surpasses pre-established thresholds. Staff’s assessment of the rule can be found at
http:/www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2013/cr13220.pdf.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF POLAND

consolidation measures of around ½ percent of GDP per year during 2015–16 would be needed to
reach the authorities’ medium-term objective (MTO) of a 1 percent of GDP structural fiscal deficit
and put the debt ratio on a stronger downward path. Strict enforcement of the new permanent fiscal
rule should help ensure that fiscal policy remains prudent. In this regard, the recent lowering of the
public debt thresholds contained in the fiscal rule is welcome. Staff also noted that conducting an
expenditure review (including tax expenditures) may also help identify areas where savings can be
made, while protecting priority spending.
26.
Staff underscored the importance of addressing legacy flaws in the pension system to
help reduce long-term fiscal risks. A sizable drop in projected replacement rates increases fiscal
risks stemming from old-age poverty. Hence, staff encouraged the authorities to consider ways to
boost savings in the voluntary third pillar to help ensure socially sustainable pensions in the future.
Other fiscal risks stemming from pre-existing flaws in the pension system could be ameliorated by
revising the indexation of notional accounts in the first pillar, seeking better alignment of the
disability formula with the core pension system, and implementing pending reforms in special
pension schemes.
27.
Fiscal policy should continue to flexibly respond to the state of the economy. In the
event of a better-than-expected recovery, there is scope for a more frontloaded fiscal adjustment in
2015. However, should growth fall significantly below the baseline path, automatic stabilizers should
be allowed to operate fully, while room for discretionary countercyclical fiscal policy would be
limited by the relatively high debt-to-GDP ratio (Annex II).
Authorities’ views
28.
The authorities broadly shared staff’s assessment of fiscal policy, but questioned some
of the implications of the pension changes set out by staff. They agreed that the fiscal deficit
was set to be substantially reduced in 2014, partly on account of the pension changes. However, the
authorities’ projections entailed a somewhat more conservative rebound in tax revenues than staff,
coupled with slightly lower expenditure projections. The authorities also agreed with staff that
additional measures would be needed to reach the MTO. On pension changes, they shared staff’s
assessment that the changes would yield a long-term improvement in the fiscal accounts and their
figures were similar to staff’s. However, they felt that staff was overstating some of the potential
drawbacks of the pension changes—notably with respect to liquidity in the domestic government
bond and equity markets (where they noted that there was no perceptible drop in liquidity) and
policy continuity (where they felt that they had clearly explained their rationale to the markets and
the public, thus mitigating risks in this area).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF POLAND

Box 5. Implications of Changes to the Polish Pension System1
The Polish pension system underwent significant changes in 2014: (i) pension funds’ holdings of
Treasury and Treasury-guaranteed bonds were transferred to the social security administration then Treasury
securities were acquired by the Ministry of Finance and cancelled (corresponding liabilities were transferred
to individual notional accounts in the first pillar and thereafter indexed by the five-year average nominal
GDP growth); (ii) new pension contributions will be channeled to the social security administration, unless
contributors “opt-in” to the second pillar; (iii) pension funds were banned from investing in government
bonds, and current benchmarking and penalty systems were removed to encourage more active portfolio
management; (iv) limits on holdings of foreign securities will be lifted over time, from the current 5 percent
of pension funds’ portfolios to 30 percent by 2016; and (v) pension payouts will be centralized in the public
system, with a gradual transfer of assets to the first pillar starting ten years before retirement.
The changes to the pension system would lead to a long-term improvement in fiscal accounts. The
changes imply a substantial downsizing of the funded second pillar, while maintaining the defined
contribution nature of the pension system (since the first pillar is a notional defined contribution system).
Thus, the economic implications are less fundamental than in some other countries that have undertaken
similar changes to their pension system. Staff analysis indicates that, under baseline population and
macroeconomic projections over 2014‒60 and assuming that half of the contributors switch completely to
the first pillar, the 2014 pension changes would lead to an improvement in the fiscal accounts of about
30 percent of GDP in net present value terms, matched by an equivalent increase in gross pension liabilities.
The increased reliance on the unfunded first pillar had a number of parallel implications:


Explicit versus implicit liabilities. Since the system operates as defined contribution, the
improvement in the fiscal accounts will be matched by an increase in gross implicit pension
liabilities. Given demographic trends, these liabilities may not be fully covered by the stream of
pension contributions beyond 2060, until the system reaches equilibrium.



Intergenerational equity. The 1999 pension reform (which established Poland’s three pillar
pension system) entailed significant fiscal costs associated with the funding of the second pillar.
These costs would have had to be borne mainly by the current generation, as legal debt limits
prevented sharing them fully with future generations via new debt issuance. Downsizing the second
pillar reduces the costs of the transition and the associated burden on the current generation.



Adequacy of pensions. The 2014 pension changes preserved the actuarial balance of the system by
keeping the defined contribution nature of the benefits. Given demographic trends, this would
imply a sharp drop in replacement rates over time, increasing risks of old-age poverty and
associated fiscal risks. These risks could be alleviated by promoting voluntary pension savings.



Constitutional aspects and policy continuity. The 2014 pension changes have been controversial,
particularly with respect to their constitutionality and property rights of second pillar assets. These
issues are under consideration by Poland’s Constitutional Tribunal. The pension changes could also
raise concerns about policy continuity and credibility. To date, however, such concerns do not seem
to have materialized—financial markets have been stable, as both market participants and ratings
agencies do not appear to have been rattled by the changes.



Domestic capital market impact. The downsizing of the second pillar would reduce inflows to the
domestic capital market, possibly affecting its speed of development. In the short run, it could also
adversely affect liquidity and increase volatility.



Risk diversification. Concentrating pensions in the first pillar, where they are primarily indexed to
the wage bill, reduces the diversification of sources of future pension income. To the extent that
greater diversification helps mitigate risks arising from idiosyncratic shocks (such as to the wage
bill), it will be important to seek additional forms of pension savings (including through increases in
private savings). See also Chapter V of Selected Issues for an analysis of saving accelerations.

C. Further Enhancing the Resilience of the Financial Sector
29.
The banking system continues to be resilient. Stress tests conducted by the NBP indicate
that the banking system can withstand adverse macroeconomic shocks with the majority of banks
able to absorb potential losses. While risks to the banking sector are mitigated by low household
indebtedness (Figure 9) and a narrowing funding gap, NBP stress tests show that some banks, which
are largely financed with foreign funds or hold substantial foreign currency loan portfolios, may
have insufficient buffers in the event of a severe liquidity shock associated also with capital outflows
and zloty depreciation. Increasing buffers in these banks would further strengthen the sector’s
resilience. The development of additional sources for long-term funding would also help banks
prepare for Basel III liquidity requirements concerning the net stable funding ratio.
30.
Supervisory measures are further strengthening the financial system. The
recommendation (to take effect from July 2014) that foreign currency mortgages be issued only to
borrowers with adequate foreign currency income, alongside past supervisory measures in this area,
has led to a halt in foreign currency mortgage lending. However, the share of legacy foreign
currency mortgages—while declining—remains sizeable, with many exhibiting high loan-to-value
(LTV) ratios. In this respect, the gradual lowering of LTV ratios on new housing loans to 80 percent in
2017 is a step in the right direction. Continued careful oversight of lending practices and credit risk
management is also essential in light of recent changes replacing general caps on debt-service-toincome ratios with those derived from banks’ internal models. Greater budgetary flexibility would
help the financial supervisory authority (KNF) ensure that its resources are deployed in the most
effective manner.
31.
Staff urged the authorities to continue to restructure credit unions. While the credit
union segment is small, with assets accounting for around 1½ percent of banking sector assets, its
capital position is inadequate. Hence, in line with the 2013 FSAP recommendation, KNF has stepped
up oversight of this vulnerable segment, initiating rehabilitation of a number of institutions (Table 8).
32.
A more proactive approach to address the outstanding stock of NPLs would be
beneficial. The stock of NPLs in the nonfinancial sector has appeared sticky at only ½ percentage
point below the 9 percent peak in January 2011. To prevent NPLs from potentially constraining
credit expansion, and ultimately economic growth, tax disincentives (in the form of constraints on
the deductibility of loan losses and debt relief) and legal obstacles (related to insolvency
procedures) to address impaired loans should be removed.
33.
Staff strongly encouraged the authorities to complete the macroprudential and bank
resolution frameworks. Legislation to create the Systemic Risk Board (SRB) involving an
independent body with responsibility for systemic risk identification and analysis and with powers to
issue directives and recommendations regarding the use of tools continue to be delayed. Staff
urged the authorities to move ahead with the legislation as establishment of the SRB is essential for
macroprudential supervision. Separately, staff welcomed continued work to overhaul the bank

resolution framework but noted that a concerted effort is needed to overcome the protracted delays
in final legislation.
Authorities’ views
34.
The authorities broadly agreed with the missions recommendations. They highlighted
the continued resilience of the financial system as one of Poland’s key strengths. Work to restructure
the credit union segment was ongoing. The legislation to create the SRB was advancing, but the
legislation to overhaul the bank resolution framework was being modified to make it consistent with
the recently issued EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive. On NPLs, the authorities were less
concerned than staff, citing the recent pick-up in credit growth and strong bank profitability. They
also noted that, in practice, the tax authorities allowed for more significant deductions of loan losses
and debt relief than that which would appear based on a strict reading of the statutes.

D. Deepening Structural Reforms
35.
Structural reforms are crucial to ensure sustained long-term growth. Since 2007, Poland
has achieved faster convergence with Western Europe than other EU new member states but its
distance to advanced economies remains large. Additional structural reforms should unleash
potential growth, crucial to avoiding a middle-income trap and fostering continued income
convergence. For example: (i) labor market reforms would help increase the participation rate, which
is below that in many regional peers, and reduce labor market segmentation, which is significantly
higher than the EU average; and (ii) improvements in the business climate would help boost
investment (Figure 10).
36.
Staff welcomed efforts to improve the functioning of the labor market and strengthen
the business climate. The authorities continued liberalizing access to regulated professions—so far
benefitting about 250 professions—and parliament passed legislation to improve the efficiency of
public employment services (for example, by providing funding to facilitate labor mobility). A draft
law—approved by the government—aims at reducing labor market segmentation by increasing the
coverage of social contributions, and work on capping the duration of temporary work contracts is
underway. Some administrative requirements were eased to help support new business start-ups.
Privatization has slowed considerably, with signals from the authorities that ownership
transformation is coming to an end. Additional privatization revenues will be directed to capitalize
the recently established state-owned investment vehicle to support infrastructure investments.
37.
To further support employment and boost potential growth, staff urged the
authorities to continue the reform process:


18

Labor market. Further actions to reduce labor market segmentation are warranted,
including by tightening rules on temporary contracts and making regular contracts more
flexible. The plan to further open access to regulated professions is welcome, and could also
help boost labor market participation.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF POLAND



Business environment. Despite substantial improvements, additional steps are needed to
reduce unwarranted administrative burdens to facilitate entry and exit of firms and boost
investment. The business climate could be further strengthened through lower costs of
contract enforcement, improvements in the insolvency regime to promote rehabilitation of
viable companies, and simplified zoning and construction regulations.



Privatization and corporate governance. While the authorities suggested that
privatization is near completion, they continue to hold stakes in more than 200 active
companies. To this end, there is scope to reduce public ownership in firms that operate in
competitive sectors and to ensure strong corporate governance standards in firms that will
remain public.

38.
Euro adoption remains an important long-term objective. The authorities continue to
make progress toward fulfilling all entry criteria, not least with the fiscal deficit anticipated to be
reduced below 3 percent of GDP in 2015. However, no target date for euro adoption has been
announced.
Authorities’ views
39.
The authorities highlighted recent advances in their structural reforms agenda. They
pointed to measures undertaken to improve the functioning of the labor market, including by
deregulating professions, reforming public employment services to enhance their efficiency, and
introducing new instruments to boost labor activity in vulnerable groups such as the youth. The
planned reform agenda includes revising insolvency regulations to promote restructuring of firms
instead of liquidation, streamlining construction and zoning regulations, and continued efforts to
reduce red tape. To ensure successful euro adoption, the authorities expressed a preference for the
additional buildup of economic buffers, including through greater labor market flexibility and further
reductions in public debt.

STAFF APPRAISAL
40.
On the back of Poland’s very strong fundamentals and policies, growth has started to
gain traction. Fiscal automatic stabilizers were allowed to operate and monetary policy was
substantially eased, which helped support the growth pick-up during the second half of 2013. At the
same time, strong fundamentals, combined with the insurance provided by the FCL arrangement
with the IMF, helped Poland weather bouts of financial market turmoil.
41.
Growth is set to strengthen further, though risks remain tilted to the downside.
Economic activity is expected to continue to gather pace, led by domestic demand. External risks are
firmly on the downside. A protracted period of slow growth in Europe, a sharp increase in
geopolitical tensions surrounding Russia and Ukraine, or side effects from global financial conditions
pose the main risks. Domestically, risks arise from a protracted period of low inflation.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

REPUBLIC OF POLAND

42.
Monetary policy has appropriately supported the economy, but rate cuts would be
needed if the recovery falters or inflation fails to pick up. Monetary policy is at a challenging
juncture: inflation is very low (partly reflecting external factors) but the recovery is continuing,
monetary conditions appear supportive, and credit growth is rising. The MPC should stand ready to
reduce rates if the recovery falters or projections indicate that inflation would remain well below
target for a protracted period. Although international reserves remain broadly adequate, moderate
reserve accumulation would be prudent in light of downside external risks and in order to prepare
for an eventual exit from the FCL arrangement.
43.
The structural fiscal consolidation planned this year is appropriate at this stage of the
economic cycle. The fiscal deficit is projected to drop by 1 percentage point to 3.3 percent of GDP
on account of modest consolidation measures, the effects of pension changes, and a cyclical
recovery in tax revenue. Reflecting the authorities’ sound public debt management strategy,
financing is comfortable with over three-quarters of government financing needs for 2014 already
covered.
44.
The ongoing pension changes are expected to improve the fiscal aggregates but may
heighten long-term fiscal risks. The changes to the pension system—which entail a downsizing of
the second pillar—are estimated to deliver an improvement in the fiscal accounts of around
30 percent of GDP in net present value terms during 2014–60. However, liquidity in the government
bond and equity markets could be adversely affected by the reduced presence of the pension funds,
risk diversification will decline, and gross implicit pension liabilities will rise. Importantly, legacy flaws
in the pension system continue to present long-term fiscal risks, and the sharp drop in future
replacement rates raises risks of old-age poverty. Measures to address these risks—including better
aligning the indexation mechanism of the notional pension accounts with wage and growth
outcomes, addressing imbalances in the special occupational pension schemes, and examining
policies to help boost voluntary private savings—will be essential going forward.
45.
Over the medium term, additional fiscal consolidation is needed to put public debt on
a stronger downward path. As the economy recovers, additional measures of ½ percent of GDP
per year would be needed in 2015‒16 to reach the authorities’ MTO of a structural deficit of
1 percent of GDP. While the permanent expenditure rule should provide an anchor, strict
enforcement of the rule will be important. In this regard, the recent lowering of the public debt
thresholds contained in the fiscal rule is welcome.
46.
The banking system has remained resilient with work to further strengthen
supervision helping to contain risks. The banking system has remained well-capitalized, liquid,
and able to withstand severe macroeconomic shocks. Nonetheless, addressing the elevated stock of
legacy NPLs by tackling tax and legal obstacles remain essential to prevent them from unduly
constraining credit growth. Final legislation to put in place the macroprudential and bank resolution
frameworks should be advanced quickly.
47.
Recent efforts to improve the business climate and labor market are welcome, but
further reforms are crucial to ensure sustained long-term growth. Progress in opening access

to regulated professions and steps to improve the business climate are welcome, but additional
reforms would help further boost long-term growth. Further steps to reduce labor market
segmentation, including by tightening rules on temporary contracts and making regular contracts
more flexible, and ease access to regulated professions are warranted. The business climate would
benefit from finalizing work on the new insolvency regime to promote rehabilitation of viable
debtors and further reducing administrative barriers. Ensuring strong corporate governance
standards in firms that will remain public will also be important.
48.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

1/ Note: Each axis shows the share of workers facing that type of skill mismatches. Mismatch of
education levels happens when the education level of a worker (e.g. high school) does not match the
job requirements (e.g. university). Mismatch of skill field happens when the worker’s field of education
(e.g. engineering) does not match the job requirements (e.g. medicine).

weak demand that could turn into stagnation.
 NPLs would increase as a result of the growth slowdown, but the
banking sector’s strong capital position is a mitigating factor.
Medium
 Significant disruptions could occur in global
financial, trade, and commodity markets,
triggering a re-pricing of risks and heightened
market volatility.
 Spillovers would materialize through trade,
financial, and confidence channels.

Medium
 Gas supply disruptions would adversely affect Poland,
particularly heavy industry (which is more reliant on imported
gas).
 Financial market/confidence effects could lead to capital flow
reversals and pressure on Polish financial markets.

4. Protracted period of low
inflation

Low/Medium
 Inflation could fail to pick up as envisaged in
the baseline—either on account of external
factors (low imported inflation) or domestic
factors (entrenched low inflation
expectations)—and remain low for a
protracted period.

Medium
 Very low inflation would increase (ex-post) real interest rates,
and weigh on investment and ultimately growth.
 To the extent that household inflation expectations in Poland
are adaptive, breaking out of a protracted low inflation
environment could be more difficult than in countries where
inflation expectations are well anchored.

5. Sovereign stress in the

Low
 Bank-sovereign-real economy links could reintensify because of stalled or incomplete
delivery of policy commitments at the
national or euro area level.
 Strong market pressure on euro area
economies would likely reverberate across
financial markets.

Medium
 Poland could face capital flow reversals and exchange rate
pressure.
 High participation of foreign investors in the domestic bond
market entails a potential transmission channel, but risks may
be mitigated by prudent public debt management.
 Liquidity in the FX derivatives market could be adversely
affected, increasing banks’ hedging costs, but risks are
mitigated by strong liquidity positions in the banking sector.

The exchange rate should be allowed to
float freely, but intervention could be used
to dampen excessive volatility. Interest
rate hikes could be used to stem pressure.
 The NBP should provide liquidity support
(including in FX) if needed.
 The FCL arrangement could be used under
extreme circumstances.
 Monetary policy should be further eased.
 Fiscal automatic stabilizers should be
allowed to operate, while paying careful
attention not to unduly widen the
structural deficit.
 In the event of adverse growth effects,
monetary policy should be further eased,
unless Poland is faced with strong capital
outflows, and fiscal automatic stabilizers
should be allowed to operate.
 The exchange rate should be allowed to
float freely, but intervention could be used
to dampen excessive volatility.
 Policy interest rates should be cut
substantially.
 The exchange rate should be allowed to
float freely.
 The scope for rate cuts could be limited in
circumstances of severe external pressure.
 The exchange rate should be allowed to
float freely, but intervention could be used
to dampen excessive volatility.
 The NBP should provide liquidity support
(including in FX) if needed.
 The FCL arrangement could be used under
extreme circumstances.

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment
of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on
the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Table 8. 2013 FSAP Recommendations and Actions Taken1

1

Key Recommendations

Status

Addressing impaired loans: (i) intensify oversight of credit risk
management and restructuring practices; (ii) standardize and
enhance transparency of bank accounting practices; and (iii)
standardize debt-to-income ratio calculation.

The authorities have completed a
thematic supervisory review of
impaired assets and issued a letter
to banks, summarizing regulatory
recommendations.

Strengthening banking supervision: (i) expand the scope for KNF
to issue legally binding prudential regulations; (ii) allow KNF's Board
to delegate administrative and procedural decisions to its
management, increase KNF independence, and address other
governance issues; and (iii) increase KNF flexibility to allocate
budgetary and staff resources and enhance its analytical
capabilities.

Pending.

Strengthening credit unions: (i) eliminate the dual supervision;
require a solvency ratio of 8 percent in 5 years; and clarify the
governance of the stabilization fund; (ii) develop an inclusive set of
SKOK regulations and apply accounting principles for financial
institutions to SKOKs; and (iii) develop capital rehabilitation plans
for financially weak SKOKs.

Rehabilitation plans are being
developed with 44 of 55 SKOKs
obliged to prepare recovery plans.

Developing sound macroprudential policies: (i) ensure the
macroprudential supervisory law provides for SRB's independence
(with a leading role for the NBP), accountability to Parliament, and
power to make recommendations coupled with an "act or explain"
mechanism; and (ii) develop clear macroprudential policy objectives
that are distinct from those of monetary and microprudential
supervisory policy.

The legislative process for setting
up a SRB is underway.

Improving the bank resolution framework: (i) ensure precedence
of administrative powers over corporate insolvency procedures; (ii)
ensure that the creditor claims hierarchy protects BFG's claims on
resources provided for balance sheet "gap filling" measures; and (iii)
include a Tier-1 capital trigger and link the "public interest" trigger
to financial stability.

Draft legislation on resolution is
progressing. The authorities focus
on adjusting the draft BFG Act to
that of BRRD.

See “Republic of Poland: Financial System Stability Assessment”, IMF Country Report No. 13/221, 2013.

Key Recommendations

Status

Improving the deposit insurance system: (i) remove the PBA
from the BFG Council; (ii) ensure adequate funding and capacity,
revise and introduce new regulations, and enhance protocols in
light of expanded mandate; and (iii) amend code of conduct to
restrict employment in member institutions to all employees.

Poland is broadly compliant with
International Association of Deposit
Insurers (IADI) Core Principles and
will be even more so once the
resolution framework has been
adopted.

Strengthening pension reform and capital markets: (i) allow
lifecycle strategies in pension funds, and measure performance of
pension funds in relation to the benchmark portfolio; (ii) amend
MCB framework to allow broader issuance and adopt a legal
framework for mortgage securitization; (iii) strengthen
enforcement of security interests and judicial decisions.

The pension system was changed in
2014. To protect pension fund
assets in the last period of saving
for retirement, they will be
gradually transferred to the Social
Security Fund, starting 10 years
before reaching retirement age.

Republic of Poland: External Debt Sustainability Framework, 2009–19

REPUBLIC OF POLAND

Annex II. Public Sector Debt Sustainability Analysis
Public debt is moderately high, at 57 percent of GDP in 2013, but sustainable. Ongoing changes to the
pension system are expected to generate a sizable one-off drop in the public debt-to-GDP ratio to
about 49½ percent of GDP in 2014. The profile of public debt in terms of interest, rollover, and foreign
currency risks appears robust. The main risk to the debt outlook stems from a negative shock to GDP
growth. In addition, a relatively large share of foreign investors in the domestic debt market entails a
channel of transmission from global shocks, although the composition of the investor base and the low
share of public debt at floating rates provide some mitigating factors.

A. Baseline and Realism of Projections


Debt levels. Poland’s favorable public debt dynamics are underpinned by a decline in the
primary deficit, a favorable differential between projected GDP growth and the real interest
rate (as the economy recovers), and the effects of ongoing changes to the pension system.
The latter would contribute to reduce the ratio of public debt-to-GDP relative to the 2013
Article IV projections by some 8 percentage points.



GDP Growth. The projections assume a gradual acceleration of GDP growth, from
1.6 percent in 2013 to 3.3 percent in 2014 and further to 3.6 percent in 2019. The output gap
is expected to close in 2016. In recent years, staff projections of growth have displayed small
forecast errors, with some indication of a pessimistic bias relative to other countries.



Fiscal Adjustment. Under the baseline, the primary deficit is expected to decline from
1.7 percent of GDP in 2013 to about balance in 2018‒19, reflecting modest fiscal measures
already in the pipeline, the changes to the pension system, and the gradual recovery in tax
revenue (closer to recent historical levels). In the recent past, staff forecasts errors of the
primary deficit in Poland have not displayed an apparent bias and have been more
conservative than those of other countries. Overall, the projected fiscal adjustment seems
feasible, as indicated by cross country benchmarks.



Sovereign yields. The effective interest rate on public debt dropped from 6.6 percent in 2005
to 5.9 percent in 2009 and further to about 5 percent in 2013. It is projected to remain stable
at around 4.8 percent over the projection period. In recent years, Poland has maintained
access to capital markets at favorable terms, even during periods of global financial distress.
Bond yields increased following Fed-tapering announcements, from a historic low average of
3.3 percent in May 2013 to around 4.1 percent in April 2014. Spreads over 10‒year German
bonds reached a minimum of 176 bps in May 2013 and increased to an average of 257 basis
points in April 2014, while EMBI and CDS spreads averaged around 110 bps and 70 bps,
respectively. While there is uncertainty about the impact of normalization of monetary policy
in the U.S. on market conditions, pass-through from interest increases to the budget would
be very slow, as about 80 percent of debt carries a fixed interest rate and the average
duration stands at 3.6 years. A 100 bps parallel shift in the yield curve will lead to an increase
in the interest bill of about 0.1 percent of GDP in the first year.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND



Changes to the pension system. Public debt projections under the baseline are strongly
influenced by ongoing changes to the pension system. From the fiscal perspective, these
changes generated a large one-off drop in (explicit) public debt in the first quarter of 2014
(with a matching increase in gross implicit public pension liabilities), and a reduction in public
financing needs over the medium term. The latter reflects the combined effect of lower public
debt service, a partial redirection of pension contributions from the second pillar to the social
security administration, and a gradual transfer of assets to the social security administration
ten years before retirement. By contrast, the associated increase in public pension payments
will gather pace in the long run, well beyond the projection period. Staff calculations, using
baseline projections for 2014‒60, indicate the pension changes would lead to a long-term
improvement in the fiscal account of about 30 percent of GDP in net present value terms.



Maturity and rollover risks. The share of short-term debt in total government debt is
negligible (there have been no t-bills outstanding since August 2013). Rollover risk for 2014 is
negligible as the authorities covered more than three-quarters of the financing needs by endMay. Going forward, rollover risk could increase somewhat as a result of the pension changes:
the share of foreign investors in the domestic market is set to increase from about 34 percent
in 2013 to 38 percent in 2014 and the overall share of external debt in total public debt will
rise from 51 percent in 2013 to about 58 percent in 2014. In addition, the share of foreign
currency debt in total debt will also increase from 30 percent in 2013 to 35 percent in 2014.
The baseline assumes gradual convergence toward the current structure of public debt in
terms of the share of foreign currency debt in total debt (30 percent) and external debt in
total debt (about 50 percent).



DSA risk assessment. The heat map highlights risks associated with the share of public debt
held by non-residents, plus the relatively large external financing requirements (25 percent of
GDP in 2012). The latter, however, is heavily influenced by the external gross financing needs
of the private sector, which include a substantial share of intercompany financing.



Fan charts. Symmetric fan charts, which treat upside and downside risks equally likely, show
that public debt is more likely to enter a downward trajectory during the projection period.
The lower bands indicate that the debt-to-GDP ratio could drop to around 40 percent by
2019 with a 25 percent probability. On the other hand, the upper bands indicate that debtto-GDP ratios could surpass 55 percent by 2019 with a 10 percent probability. A more
stringent exercise, however, combining restrictions to the upside shocks to interest rates and
GDP growth (200 bps and 1 percent, respectively), increases the probability of debt-to-GDP
surpassing 55 percent in 2019 to 25 percent. This result is still commensurate with a
sustainable debt path, but it illustrates the degree of uncertainty around the baseline.

B. Shocks and Stress Tests


Primary balance shock. An assumed deterioration in the primary balance by 0.9 percentage
points in 2014‒15 delays by two years the downward trend of the debt-to-GDP ratio and
pushes up slightly public debt to revenues to about 130 percent in 2015 (from about
127 percent in 2014). Gross financing needs peak to about 12 percent of GDP in 2015 but
converge to the baseline by 2017.



Growth Shock. The stress scenario assumes a drop in GDP growth by 1.9 percentage points
in two consecutive years (2014‒15) relative to the baseline, combined with a 0.5 percent drop
in inflation and deterioration in the primary balance by 0.9 percent in 2014 and further by
1.8 percent in 2015. Under these assumptions, public debt increases to about 54 percent of
GDP in 2016 before trending downward to about 50 percent of GDP by 2019. Gross financing
needs increase to about 14 percent of GDP in 2016, but then converge quickly toward the
baseline in the outer years.



Interest rate shock. A permanent 200 bps increase in the nominal interest rate starting in
2014 (equivalent to the difference between the maximum real interest rate during
2003‒13 and the average real interest rate over the projection), would lead to an increase in
the effective interest rate on debt by 52 bps in 2015 and further gradual increases to 170 bps
by 2019. Under this scenario, public debt dynamics deteriorate marginally relative to the
baseline. Public debt remains at about 48 percent of GDP by 2016, while gross financing
needs reach about 12 percent of GDP at the end of the projection period.



Exchange rate shock. The combined shock also assumes an exchange rate depreciation of
about 26 percent in 2015 (from 3.1 PLN/USD to 3.9 PLN/USD), calibrated to emulate the
maximum historic movement of the FX rate over the last 10 years. Under this scenario, Gross
public debt increases to about 50 percent of GDP in 2015 before trending downward to
about 46 percent by 2019. The resilience reflects the predominance of public debt in local
currency.



Combined shock. Under the combined shock, the public-debt-to-GDP ratio jumps sharply to
about 60 percent in 2016 and remains broadly stable afterward. In turn, gross financing needs
increase to about 14 percent of GDP in 2015‒16, and remain between 12‒14 percent of GDP
in the outer years.

1/ Public sector is defined as general government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over German bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ From 2014 onwards, reflects the transfer of pension fund assets and liabilities to the social security administration.
9/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
10/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Exchange Arrangements:
The zloty is freely floating.
Poland accepted the obligation of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on June 1, 1995. Poland maintains an
exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions, except for the exchange restrictions imposed by Poland solely for the preservation of
national or international security as introduced by the European Union within the framework of the
Common Foreign and Security Policy. The consolidated list of such sanctions is available at:
http://eeas.europa.eu/cfsp/sanctions/consol-list/index_en.htm.
Article IV Consultation:
The last Article IV consultation was concluded on July 17, 2013. In concluding the consultation,
Directors emphasized that Poland’s sound macroeconomic management, strong fundamentals, resilient
financial system, and adequate international reserves have helped preserve confidence in the country’s
policies. The Precautionary Flexible Credit Line arrangement has provided insurance against external
risks. At the same time, they observed that Poland’s high trade and financial interconnectedness with
Europe and open capital account make it susceptible to shocks. Directors commended the authorities’
commitment to fiscal sustainability. For 2013, most Directors agreed that automatic stabilizers should
be allowed to operate fully around budgeted measures, though a few considered that further
consolidation measures could be necessary. Directors broadly agreed that the medium-term objective
of a structural deficit of 1 percent of GDP by 2016 remains appropriate. However, they noted that
additional fiscal measures would be needed to put the public debt ratio firmly on a downward path.
Directors looked forward to the implementation of a simple and transparent expenditure rule, which
should allow for countercyclical fiscal policy. On monetary policy, Directors agreed that the
accommodative monetary policy stance is appropriate in a context of muted inflationary pressures and
narrow fiscal space. However, a number of Directors advised a cautious approach to further easing,
given risks associated with a low rate environment. Directors welcomed the findings of the Financial
System Stability Assessment that the banking system is well capitalized, profitable, and liquid. At the
same time, they underscored that safeguarding asset quality will be essential. Directors looked forward
to the establishment of macroprudential and bank resolution frameworks. Directors encouraged
continued structural reforms to boost potential growth and maximize the benefits of integration into
global supply chains.
Resident Representative:
Mr. James Roaf replaced Mr. Mark Allen as the Senior Regional Resident Representative for Central and
Eastern Europe, effective August 8, 2013.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance (continued)

General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: The Central Statistical Office (GUS) compiles and disseminates annual and quarterly
GDP by production and expenditure approaches, both at current and previous year’s prices following
1993 SNA and ESA 1995. A full set of annual accounts, including financial accounts by institutional
sectors, is also compiled but with a lag of 2 years. A supply and use table is only available for the year
2005.
Price Statistics: The CPI does not cover the imputed rents of owner-occupied dwellings. The scope of
the index covers all resident households, except those in some rural areas. The PPI does not include any
estimation for missing prices or quality and seasonal adjustments.
Government Finance Statistics: General government data are released on a quarterly basis, and
compiled on the same basis as the annual general government data, i.e. derived from detailed ESA
(European System of Accounts) data. Revenue and expense are available according to the full economic
classification and, in addition, expense is also available according to COFOG (Classification of the
Functions of Government).
Further significant enhancements to government data are necessary to comply with the accrual basis of
reporting and to compile full information on financial and nonfinancial asset stock data for general
government.

Monetary and Financial Statistics: Beginning with data for January 2004, the National Bank of Poland
(NBP) compiles monetary accounts in accordance with the ECB’s framework for monetary statistics using
the national residency approach. An earlier ROSC mission recommended that the NBP, in cooperation
with the Ministry of Finance, reconcile monetary and government finance statistics and carry out a
reconciliation exercise on a regular basis. In November 2009, the NBP began reporting financial
soundness indicators based on the IMF’s Financial Soundness Indicators Compilation Guide. Data are
reported on a quarterly basis with a lag of approximately one quarter.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 7

REPUBLIC OF POLAND

I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance (concluded)

Balance of Payments: Largely to improve data accuracy, the NBP reduced its reliance on the
International Transactions Reporting System (ITRS) and increased its reliance on survey-based source
data, starting in the first quarter of 2010. STA undertook an evaluation mission to Poland in July 2009,
and followed up in June 2011 to assess further data improvements and anticipated revisions in the
external sector accounts. Due to the comprehensive work on improving the data sources, the errors and
omissions reduced from 4 percent of GDP in 2004 to around 2 percent of GDP in recent years, which is
comparable to the level in other European countries. Authorities are committed to further improving the
compilation system for the external sector statistics.
Starting with the data for Q1 2014, Poland, as all other EU countries, will start disseminating balance of
payments data in accordance with the sixth edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments and International
Investment Position Manual (BPM6).

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Poland
On June 23, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with the Republic of Poland.
The economy is steadily recovering from the 2012–13 slowdown on the back of Poland’s very
strong fundamentals and policies. Real GDP growth moderated to 1.6 percent in 2013 as the
slowdown in core euro area countries had knock-on effects on consumer and investor
confidence. However, a steady recovery is now underway with growth accelerating to
3.4 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2014, led by improving conditions in main trading
partners and a recovery in domestic demand. Nonetheless, partly reflecting external factors, CPI
inflation remains well below the target range, declining to 0.2 percent year-on-year in May. As
the trade balance turned positive in 2013, the current account deficit narrowed to its lowest level
in more than a decade.
The outlook is for a continuing recovery but external risks remain firmly on the downside.
Growth is expected to reach 3.3 percent in 2014 but strong trade and financial linkages with core
euro area countries make it vulnerable to growth shocks. Although the U.S. tapering of
unconventional monetary policy has so far had only limited impact on Polish financial markets, a
further tightening of global financial conditions could lead to capital outflows and increase
interest rates, as could rising geopolitical tensions surrounding Russia and Ukraine. Poland’s
Flexible Credit Line (FCL) arrangement with the IMF helps mitigate these risks.
Policies have appropriately supported the recovery while continuing adjustment. The fiscal
balance worsened to 4.3 percent of GDP in 2013 on account of weak economic growth, which
took a toll on tax collections. However, the cyclically-adjusted balance continued to gradually
improve and the fiscal framework was overhauled with the approval of a permanent expenditure
rule. More recently, the pension system underwent significant changes, entailing a downsizing of
the second pillar. Monetary policy has kept rates on hold after a substantial easing cycle ended in
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

July 2013. The banking sector has remained well capitalized, profitable, and liquid, reliance on
parent funding has declined, and foreign currency mortgage issuance has effectively halted.
However, the share of foreign currency mortgages remains high and the Non-Performing Loan
(NPL) ratio, while starting to edge down, has remained sticky at around 8½ percent.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted that Poland’s very strong fundamentals and economic policies had
helped it weather the turmoil in financial markets during 2013–14, and welcomed the current
economic recovery, buoyed by more robust domestic and external demand. Noting that external
risks—including geopolitical developments, tightening global financial conditions, and slower
growth in main trading partners—remain elevated, Directors encouraged the authorities to
strengthen the economy’s resilience by rebuilding policy buffers and stepping up critical
structural reforms. They noted that the precautionary FCL arrangement provides important
insurance against external risks.
Directors advised that a measured pace of fiscal consolidation over the medium term would help
restore the fiscal deficit to more prudent levels without weighing unduly on growth. The
authorities’ medium-term objective, and a stronger downward trajectory for the public debt ratio,
could be achieved through better expenditure prioritization, following a review of public
expenditures, and improved tax compliance and efficiency of tax administration. Directors
considered that the changes to the pension system would deliver an improvement in the fiscal
accounts, and urged the authorities to address legacy flaws in the pension system and consider
measures to deal with the sharp drop in future replacement rates. Directors also advised
continued monitoring of liquidity in the government bond and equity markets, given the reduced
presence of pension funds.
Directors concurred that the monetary stance was broadly appropriate within the context of
limited inflationary pressures and subdued euro area inflation. However, heightened vigilance is
needed, as policy interest rates could be further reduced if the recovery falters or if revised
projections indicate below-target inflation for a protracted period.
While noting that international reserves remain broadly adequate, most Directors concurred that
moderate reserve accumulation would be prudent in light of external risks. However, some
Directors questioned the need for further reserve accumulation given that they were assessed to
be broadly adequate under the IMF’s metric.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3
Directors commended the resilience of the banking system, which remains well capitalized,
profitable, and liquid. However, they called for enhanced financial sector supervision, given the
elevated ratio of NPLs and the large share of foreign-currency-denominated mortgages. Directors
advised tackling legal obstacles and tax disincentives to resolving NPLs, and expediting the
completion of the macro-prudential and bank resolution frameworks—including legislation to
create a Systemic Risk Board.
Directors encouraged the authorities to deepen structural reforms to achieve more inclusive
sustainable growth. They called for further liberalization of regulated professions and other labor
market reforms, to help reduce segmentation and unemployment. Additional privatizations,
further reduction of administrative barriers, and finalization of the work on the new insolvency
regime to promote rehabilitation of viable debtors would also help improve the business climate.

Statement by Dominik Radziwill, Alternate to the Executive Director for the Republic
of Poland, and Joanna Osinska, Advisor to the Executive Director,
June 23, 2014
On behalf of our Polish authorities, we would like to thank staff for the constructive
consultations held in Warsaw and the comprehensive set of papers. The authorities broadly
agree with staff's assessments and policy recommendations.
Economic Outlook
Between late 2011 and early 2013, the Polish economy was experiencing a cyclical
slowdown with growth moderating to below 2 percent due to unfavorable economic
conditions in the euro area (Poland's main trading partner), lower household consumption,
fiscal tightening, and falling public investments financed with EU structural funds. Last year,
however, the economy started to recover. Since the last quarter of 2013, economic growth
has been driven mainly by a rebound in domestic demand, which was supported by a rise in
private consumption and investment growth. The acceleration in private consumption
resulted from an improvement on the labor market. In the coming quarters, consumption
growth should be further spurred on by an increase in households’ real disposable income,
prompted by low inflation. Private investment activity will be supported by rising exports
thanks to higher growth among Poland's trading partners, low financing costs and the
government’s "Polish Investments" program. According to official projections, economic
growth is expected to reach levels well above 3.0 percent in 2014.
Poland remains one of the top EU performers in terms of economic growth. Over the recent
years, Poland has been the fastest catching-up-economy in the EU. In contrast to other
countries, Poland avoided recession and its cumulative real GDP growth since 2008 reached
20 percent—almost twice as much as for Slovakia, the second top performer.
Labor market conditions are also slowly improving. The unemployment rate, although still
high, has decreased to 9.7 percent in April—the lowest level over the past three years. While
productivity has been steadily rising, limited wage pressure keeps unit labor costs in check
and translates into improving labor cost competitiveness.
External Sector
The current account (CA) deficit in 2013, at 1.3 percent of GDP, reached its lowest level in
over a decade. A favorable competitive position and weak domestic demand, translating into
lower imports, fuelled a sharp improvement in the balance on goods and services. Export
dynamics were sustained by gains in the market share and an expansion toward Central and
Eastern European as well as other developing markets.

2
In April 2014, according to preliminary data, the current account recorded the highest surplus
in the recent history. This contributed to a reduction of the overall CA deficit in terms of
12-month GDP to only 0.8 percent. It was accompanied by a substantial capital account
surplus, primarily a factor of a strong inflow of the EU structural funds. External debt is
relatively stable—approximately 70 percent of GDP. At the same time, around two-thirds of
corporate external debt is either intercompany or trade credit, which substantially reduces
roll-over risk. The level of official reserves slightly decreased over the last few months, but
remains broadly adequate, fully covering short-term external debt. Moreover, Poland
continues to benefit from the precautionary Flexible Credit Line arrangement with the Fund
which provides an additional reserve buffer against external shocks and helps strengthen
investor confidence.
Fiscal Policy
In 2013, the Polish authorities faced challenging conditions for fiscal consolidation. An
unfavorable external environment, cyclical slowdown and the widened output gap translated
into a significant decline in tax revenues. This hindered the realization of the previously
foreseen fiscal adjustment path. In December 2013, the Ecofin Council issued a new
recommendation extending the deadline for correction of Poland’s deficit by one year, to
2015. Poland’s general government deficit, in 2013, widened to 4.3 percent of GDP, which
was lower, however, than the 4.8 recommended by the Council. At the same time, in
response to the Council’s recommendation, the Polish authorities took further consolidation
measures. In result, in the recent European Commission's assessment, Poland has met the
recommended change in the structural balance foreseen for 2014 and is expected to stay
within the ceiling of the headline deficit recommended by the Council.
Looking ahead, the government is committed to reducing the excessive imbalance in public
finances in a manner which would not pose a threat to medium-term growth prospects. In line
with the Council recommendation, the authorities are aiming at bringing down the deficit in a
sustainable manner below 3 percent of GDP in 2015. In addition, fiscal policy in the coming
years will be oriented towards achieving the medium-term budgetary objective (MTO) of
1 percent of GDP. This will be fostered by compliance with the new stabilizing expenditure
rule introduced last year.
This year, the general government sector is projected to record a one-off surplus of
5.8 percent of GDP due to the effect of the recent reform of the pension system. This follows
a review concluded by the authorities last year and their decision to introduce changes to the
second pension pillar in order to eliminate inefficiencies inherent in its original design. The
creation of the second pension pillar in 1999 led to a significant financing gap in the first
pillar, operating on the PAYGO basis. This gap had to be financed with transfers from the
state budget, which necessitated additional debt issuance. In the years 1999–2012 the
accumulated amount of that debt reached 17.5 percent of GDP.

3
As a result of the reform, part of the pension fund assets (Treasury securities and Treasuryguaranteed bonds) were transferred from the second (privately managed) to the first (public)
pillar. Cancellation of the acquired Treasury securities (after their equivalent was registered
on the individual social security sub-accounts) led to a significant reduction in the general
government debt (from 57.1 percent of GDP in 2013 to, projected, 49.5 in 2014). Changes to
the pension system had been subject to extensive discussions with all stakeholders. The
authorities also placed high importance on ensuring that they clearly communicate the
changes to the markets. Rating agencies assessed the changes as rating neutral. In the long
term, the effects are expected to be positive—thanks to lower debt, servicing costs, and
borrowing requirements. Furthermore, given the significant reduction in the debt-to-GDP
ratio, two new lower public debt thresholds triggering downward corrections in the
expenditure growth limits were introduced in the public finance law—together with the new
stabilizing expenditure rule. They are equal to, respectively, 43 and 48 percent of GDP, and
they replaced the previous 50 percent threshold.
Monetary Policy
In 2013, inflation pressure in Poland was very weak and the headline CPI remained
significantly below the inflation target. The low inflation rate resulted from low demand
pressures, and favorable dynamics of electricity and food prices. The Monetary Policy
Council (MPC) continued the cycle of interest rate cuts initiated in late 2012. Over the entire
cycle, NBP reference rate was reduced by 225 bps, from 4.75 percent in November 2012 to
the all-time low 2.50 percent in July 2013. The MPC has kept the interest rates unchanged
ever since, and on several occasions signaled that the rates should further remain unchanged
in subsequent quarters. The Council currently assesses that NBP interest rates ought to be
kept unchanged until the end of the third quarter of 2014. The MPC does not exclude interest
rate adjustments if the incoming information supports such a decision.
Financial Sector
Amid the GDP slowdown in 2012–13 and the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area, the
Polish financial sector has remained stable and resilient. In spite of the impact of the financial
crisis on some of the foreign parent institutions, there has been no evidence of disorderly
deleveraging in the Polish banking sector. Banks maintain low leverage ratios, remain liquid,
well-capitalized, and highly profitable. The banking sector has ample capital resources to
meet credit demand as growth picks up, while improving economic fundamentals should in
turn further strengthen its position.
Despite an unfavorable environment, the net profits of Polish banks have been stable since
reaching a record high in 2011. In line with recommendations issued by the Financial
Supervisory Authority, banks maintained their capital buffers with the capital adequacy ratio
reaching 15.6 percent at the end of Q1 2014 and Tier 1 capital representing around
90 percent of total capital. At the same time, the liability structure of Polish banks improved

4
as the parent-based funding was reduced in an orderly fashion and, to some extent,
substituted with deposits from non-financial residents.
After a slower credit growth in 2013, the expansion picked up this year. As of Q1:2014,
overall credit to the non-financial sector grew by 4.4 percent y-o-y (after exchange rate
adjustment). The growth in loans to enterprises continues to be supported by the successful
government guarantees program “De Minimis”, now covering both—working capital and
investment loans.
Simultaneously, work is progressing on further measures to strengthen the financial sector
and improve supervision, including macroprudential and bank resolution frameworks.
Regulatory and supervisory actions to reduce the share of FX loans in new mortgage lending
proved successful as the FX mortgage portfolio has been in runoff mode since mid-2012.
Loan-to-value limits for housing and commercial real estate loans, which came into force in
early 2014 and will be gradually tightened until 2017, should contribute to strong loan
quality going forward. While still high, the share of NPLs in non-financial sector decreased
slightly over the past year, on the account of improving economic conditions and sales of
NPLs by some banks. The coverage of NPLs by provisions remains at a comfortable level.
Structural Reforms
The Polish authorities continue to implement their structural reforms agenda. Starting this
year, they plan to undertake new measures to improve tax compliance and strengthen the
efficiency of tax administration. They maintain efforts to further advance labor and product
market reforms, with a focus on increasing the labor participation rate, especially among
women, limiting labor market segmentation, and reducing youth unemployment. Important
steps have been taken to facilitate access to regulated professions, with subsequent tranches
of de-regulations gradually entering into force. In addition, the authorities remain committed
to further improving the business environment and reducing red-tape.
