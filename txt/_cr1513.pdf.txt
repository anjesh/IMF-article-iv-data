STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 24, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Focus: The main themes centered on tackling macroeconomic vulnerabilities and
improving the medium-term outlook by achieving an ambitious fiscal adjustment while
protecting social spending, creating an environment for higher private sector-led
growth, and building a robust financial sector.
Main policy issues


A reduction in the fiscal deficit of 3½ percent of GDP is needed over the next three
years to place public debt on a sustainable path to maintain access to market
financing on favorable terms. This adjustment should be accompanied by welltargeted social spending to protect the most vulnerable and continued progress in
lessening inequality.



A broad strategy is also needed to reduce the growing imbalances in the pension
system and restore its sustainability for future generations. In this regard, a broadbased dialog across all segments of Salvadoran society is needed to build support
for a reform that should include an increase in the retirement age and introduce a
progressive taxation of benefits. Steps are also needed to further strengthen public
financial management to mitigate key fiscal risks, including by enhancing
expenditure monitoring and control (to avoid future spending arrears) and
recording contingent fiscal liabilities transparently in the fiscal accounts.



The authorities’ goal of raising potential growth to 3 percent while reducing
inequality will require substantial supply-side measures to enhance productivity
and competitiveness. These should aim to reduce red-tape, increase access to
credit, upgrade infrastructure, provide access to and lower the cost of energy, and
diversifying the economy. The FOMILENIO II grant from the U.S. provides a
valuable opportunity to catalyze such growth-enhancing reforms.



Banking indicators appear sound, a product of prudent supervision and regulation.
Nonetheless, there is scope to further strengthen the institutional underpinnings
for financial stability by upgrading the legal framework for bank resolution and by
creating an appropriate liquidity safety net for banks.

BACKDROP
1.
Economic Context. Over the last five years, progress has been made in lowering poverty,
undertaking tax reforms, and implementing some structural reforms, including recent legislation
on Private-Public Partnerships (PPPs) and Anti Money Laundering. These have occurred within
the context of low and stable inflation in the fully dollarized economy. Policy initiatives were
taken to lower the fiscal deficit—including during two Fund-supported Stand-By Arrangements
in 2009 and 2010—but have proved insufficient. Fiscal imbalances, which widened during
the 2009 global crisis, have persisted. As a result, public debt is now on an upward trend and
projected fiscal and external gross financing needs are high, putting at risk the macroeconomic
and social gains made so far. Progress in broader reforms to attract private investment and for
financial sector development has been limited causing growth in El Salvador to underperform
that of its peers (Annex I).
2.
Political context: President Sanchez Cerén of the left-wing FMLN party took office in
June 2014. He has vowed to raise growth to at least 3 percent on a sustained basis and
undertake “austerity” in non-essential spending to create room for more social outlays. However,
the Congressional elections planned for March 2015 are hindering effective policymaking.

A CHALLENGING ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
3.
Low growth, but with low and stable inflation. For over a decade, El Salvador’s growth
has lagged the Central American region (Figure 1). Private consumption, partly financed by
remittances, has been the main driver while investment has been the lowest in the region. In
2013, against slowing remittances, growth decelerated to 1.7 percent, with some one-off capital
projects boosting investment. Growth has picked up to 2 percent in H1 of 2014—reaching
El Salvador’s estimated potential growth (Box 1)—on the back of higher remittances, but highfrequency indicators have been weaker in Q3. Inflation has hovered at around one percent for
the past two years, but peaked at 2 percent in August 2014 due to a drought-related increase in
food prices which has now subsided.

Box 1. El Salvador: Potential Growth, Investment, and Institutions1
Potential growth is estimated to be around 2 percent, with weak capital formation and productivity.
Competitiveness gaps, uncertainty from frequent elections, and high debt are a drag on investment.
Potential growth: Based on various filters and total factor productivity (TFP) analysis, potential growth is
estimated at about 2 percent for the period of 1999–2015, with factor accumulation being the main
contributor. TFP has been negative in recent years, lowering potential growth, unlike in the rest of the region
which had a positive contribution to potential growth from TFP.

Investment analysis: Average private investment in El Salvador
during 2008–13 was below 12 percent of GDP, the lowest in the
region. Based on regression analysis, increasing El Salvador’s
competitiveness, the quality of economic institutions to regional
levels, and reducing political uncertainty from frequent electoral
cycles would raise private investment between 1 to 6 percent of
GDP. If competitiveness scores and institutional quality levels
reach the highest scores in the region (Costa Rica and Panama,
respectively), the investment ratio increases by about 1¼ and
6 percent of GDP, respectively. Furthermore, investment
increases by 1–2 percent of GDP if debt levels drop to 40 percent
of GDP.

Low unemployment, but a large informal economy. The unemployment rate is
relatively low (5.9 percent in 2013). This, however, masks the less favorable underlying
employment situation given extensive underemployment (28 percent of urban employees either
work part-time or receive below-minimum wage) and the large informal economy (about
60 percent of labor force). Private sector minimum wages are not high compared to the region,
despite the 4 percent increases in June 2013 and January 2014. However, they are set to rise by
another 4 percent in January 2015, which, along with high growth in public wages, may impact
competitiveness.
5.
High fiscal imbalances. The fiscal deficit has been about 4 percent of GDP since 2010,
generating annual gross financing needs of around 8–9 percent of GDP, which is significant for a
country with the domestic market size of El Salvador, creating periodic financing pressures and

The US$800 million Eurobond—issued in
September at 6.4 percent yield—has eased immediate financing pressures and allowed a sizable
reduction in arrears. However, the public debt stock is likely to rise above 60 percent of GDP by
end-2014.

6.
Weakening competitiveness. The current account deficit deteriorated in recent years
due to a decline in private saving/investment balance and the absence of fiscal consolidation
(Figure 3). In 2013, it reached 6½ percent of GDP as exports faced broad-based weaknesses,
including from the coffee leaf-rust disease. With very low FDI, the 2013 current account deficit
was mostly financed by commercial bank and corporate borrowing, and a drawdown of
international reserves.1 The external position improved in H1 2014 due to lower imports, services
exports, and recovering remittances. For the whole year, it is expected to be about 5½ percent,
also reflecting the recent drop in oil prices. El Salvador’s real effective exchange rate is slightly
overvalued (by 2 to 9 percent), and non-price indicators point to a growing competitiveness gap
(see Annex II). Reserve coverage is slightly below the IMF’s composite metric and the authorities’
own goal (of about 12 percent of GDP). However, staff’s preferred metric (which is more tailored
to a fully-dollarized country requiring fiscal and financial sector buffers) implies a greater
shortfall relative to an assessed adequate level of reserves of around 17 percent of GDP.2

is expected to unwind from 2016 due to receding terms of trade gains and a fiscal deficit
widening to 5½ percent of GDP by 2019. Public debt is expected to rise to over 70 percent of
GDP by 2019 (Annex III).
8.
Risks: Global uncertainties linked to the normalization of U.S. monetary policy or a
deteriorating economic outlook for advanced and emerging markets have the potential to
interact with domestic vulnerabilities and create significant downside risks (Table 1).


Risks from abroad: Higher-than-expected global interest rates may increase borrowing
costs and worsen the public debt dynamics (since some 43 percent of public debt is at
floating rates linked to the U.S. LIBOR). An unexpected increase in global risk aversion
could limit access to international capital markets, which may trigger a costly and
disorderly adjustment. On the upside, a sustained further fall in oil prices could lessen
external imbalances and have some positive growth effects, although these would be
partly offset by consumption imports and a limited supply-side response of the economy
to the better terms of trade. Similarly, better-than-expected growth in the U.S. would
have positive spillovers to El Salvador through remittances and trade.



Domestic risks: A worsening of domestic policies—including through a rise in public
spending in the run-up to the March 2015 election—could further weaken fiscal and
external balances. Poor security, political fragmentation, and vulnerability to natural
disasters pose further downside risks. Growth could also be lower if the expected
investment projects face execution or financing delays. A prospective downward
statistical revision to GDP could worsen investors’ perceived country risk.

9.
Authorities’ views. The authorities argued that staff’s baseline was too pessimistic and
some risks were exaggerated. They forecast growth of 2.2 percent in 2014 and 3.1 percent in
2015. They cited stronger spillovers from the U.S. recovery, higher investment levels and more
favorable investment multipliers than those envisaged by staff. The authorities acknowledged

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

EL SALVADOR

that higher global interest rates were a possibility, but did not consider this a significant risk for
2015. They were confident that the need for further Eurobond issuance in 2015 and even 2016
was low, and regarded any constraints on market access as unlikely given their successful track
record of domestic and international bond issuances.

and-shaming of tax delinquents—but staff estimates that these will only deliver a fraction of the
promised adjustment (0.1–0.2 percent of GDP in the long-term, although short-term savings
from the FTT could be higher). The remaining measures have yet to be identified or legislated,
and may include a luxury property tax and spending cuts. Even if the planned adjustment was
fully implemented, it would still be insufficient to prevent a steady increase in public debt over
the next decade.
11.
A more ambitious effort—of 3½ percent of GDP during 2015–17—is needed to
achieve debt sustainability. This adjustment could be spread over 3 years to minimize

below on a potential fiscal adjustment scenario).
The authorities’ intentions, as expressed in the FRL, are a good first step and the latest Eurobond
issuance helps buy some time to undertake the adjustment. The recent decline in oil prices may
also help improve fiscal accounts through lower subsidy spending (particularly on liquefied
petroleum gas (LPG)), but staff estimates that such savings would be small (0.1 percent of GDP).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

EL SALVADOR

Regardless, these favorable developments should not lead to complacency or underestimation of
the urgent need for fiscal adjustment. Rather, the uncertainty and risks linked to global interest
rates and the market’s willingness to continue financing El Salvador should lead to a
reinvigorated effort to lower the public sector deficit and build fiscal buffers. Caution should be
exercised in spending to limit the 2014 deficit to 4 percent of GDP but without accumulating
arrears or creating a large drop in public investment. For 2015, lowering the deficit by around
1½ percent of GDP would represent an important down-payment on the path of fiscal
adjustment. Over the next two years, the deficit could then be lowered by around 1 percent of
GDP each year.

Box 2. Sizing Up a Sustainable Level of Public Debt for El Salvador
The highest debt/GDP ratio consistent with El Salvador’s debt sustainability is assessed to be 40–50 percent.
To identify a prudent range for El Salvador’s public debt, several methodologies were tested:
The Signal Approach minimizes the noise-to-signal ratio

10

during debt distress episodes. For El Salvador, this yields
a public debt limit of 46 percent of GDP. The calculation
is, however, sensitive to the definition of a debt distress
event.

Debt Intolerance Approach infers country-specific debt
targets based on determinants of investor ratings. The
analysis (Bannister and Barrot, 2012) estimates a debt
tolerance of up to 34 percent of GDP, below which the
country would be considered sub-investment grade. Such
an “investment grade threshold”, however, may be a
tougher standard than the level consistent with debt
sustainability.

Exceptional Fiscal Performance Approach assesses the maximum debt consistent with a highest primary
balance, contingent on a realistic outlook for the interest-growth differential. For El Salvador, the historically
negative average growth-interest rate differential is expected to continue. Given that the maximum primary
surplus achieved was 0.6 percent of GDP (in 2007), it suggests that public debt should not exceed 50 percent
of GDP.
An Uncertainty Approach takes the level of debt consistent with an exceptional fiscal performance and
builds in a buffer to handle the likelihood of reasonable shocks to the fiscal position and the interest-growth
differential. On this basis, the debt threshold is estimated at about 45 percent of GDP.
Comparing with other fully-dollarized economies with an explicit debt limit in their fiscal framework, a
“safe” level of debt is estimated at around 40 percent of GDP.

The growth implications of the adjustment. There would likely be a negative growth
effect from the proposed fiscal adjustment. Based on conservative multipliers,3 growth would
decline to 1½ percent in the near-term but, with the benefit of supply-side reforms and lower
fiscal and external vulnerabilities, growth could accelerate to 3 percent by 2018–19. The adverse
short-term growth effects could be more muted if the fiscal effort succeeds in generating
positive confidence effects. However, the near-term growth effects should not justify inaction as
the benefits would outweigh the costs. Public debt would be lower by 15 percent of GDP in 2019
relative to the baseline, the current account deficit would fall to around 4 percent of GDP, and
there would be no fiscal financing gap after 2016. Thus, undertaking the adjustment
preemptively in the next few years would lower the probability of a disorderly market-led
adjustment, which would be very costly in terms of likely output losses.

Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed with the need to reduce fiscal imbalances, but
disagreed with the recommended size and pace of the proposed adjustment. They were

concerned that the adverse consequences for growth could be larger than the projected
0.5–0.7 percentage points, and could impact social stability. They expected fiscal financing costs
to remain relatively low and stressed that the bulk of the fiscal deficit (about 2 percent of GDP)
and debt (11 percent of GDP at end-2013) was linked to imbalances in the pension system. Thus,
they considered a smaller and more gradual non-pension fiscal adjustment as striking a
reasonable balance between fiscal sustainability and inclusive growth. At the same time, they
proposed addressing pension-related imbalances on a separate track over a longer horizon (¶15
and 18). The authorities argued that their preferred adjustment could be achieved by revenuebased measures including a wealth tax and crackdowns on tax exemptions in particular sectors.
They did, however, indicate that the potential for subsidy rationalization would be examined after
the March elections.

Background. Since 1998, El Salvador has been moving
toward a fully-funded, defined-contributions (DC) pension
system. The reform entailed substantial fiscal “transition
costs” as most of the contributions accrued to the private
pension funds for future pension payments, but current
pension obligations had to be budget financed. Also, over
the past decade, there were periodic decisions to “top-up”
benefits under the DC system—mostly aiming to match it
with the defined benefits (DB) of the old segment—making
the transition protracted and more costly. Dependence on
budget support remains heavy, including for the still-large
“grandfathered” DB segment that offers generous benefits
The transition has also distracted attention from parametric
reforms like raising retirement age, which is among the
lowest in the region.

Current shortcomings. (i) Pressures for discretionary increases in benefits are a key source of instability and
vulnerability; (ii) unfunded liabilities are estimated at 94 percent of GDP in NPV terms; (iii) future replacement
rates are projected to almost halve; (iv) coverage, participation, and contribution payments are low (partly due
to the expected fall in future replacement rates); (v) benefits are highly unequal across pensioners, and

Projections and risks. Pension payments will significantly
burden the fiscal accounts at least for the next 15 years,
adding to an already-high public debt. Significant risks also
arise from potential new policy initiatives including extending
a “top-up” to the cohort who are currently expected to
receive fully-private pensions. This would put the unfunded
liability near 200 percent of GDP.

Elements of a solution. In 2013, the government evaluated

that aligning parameters to international levels eliminates
only about one-third of the estimated unfunded liability. Beyond its fiscal impact, a parametric reform would
also raise replacement rates, thereby limiting the risk of further top-ups. In staff’s view, an effective reform
strategy should be comprehensive and include: (i) full costing of key policy options and risks that are
integrated and regularly updated within a DSA; (ii) an ambitious package of parametric reforms;
(iii) progressive taxation of pension benefits, to mitigate highly unequal benefits; and (iv) clearly identifying
the residual budget support needs to maintain the viability of the system for current contributors.

16.
Improvements to the Fiscal Responsibility Law: The societal dialog triggered by the
draft FRL highlights the need for institutional mechanisms to guarantee fiscal discipline. The draft
law makes progress in several procedural aspects—e.g., fiscal transparency, cash management,
medium-term orientation, and budget process—but needs improvement in other dimensions
(Box 4). In particular, the numerical fiscal rules need to (i) prioritize among the multiple (and
sometimes inconsistent) fiscal “anchors”; (ii) adopt mechanisms to automatically correct
slippages from the targeted medium-term path, and (iii) introduce well-defined escape clauses to
allow for policy flexibility during severe economic downturns.
17.
Enhancing public financial management (PFM). Enhancing the monitoring of
spending arrears and creating a more robust system for measurement and control of spending
commitments is needed. Fiscal transparency would also benefit from a systematic recording of
contingent fiscal liabilities into the budget and the government’s accounts (including those
linked to pensions and PPPs). This could be complemented by a detailed fiscal risk statement in
the annual budget proposal. Finally, transactions with PetroCaribe (if undertaken by the
nonfinancial public sector) should be reported in the budget documents and to the public.
18.
Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed that pension reforms are important for fiscal
and social sustainability. They committed to action in this area after the March elections,
although they do not yet have a clear plan. Counterparts were open to incorporating additional
technical recommendations on the FRL, but noted that making changes now would depend on
the ability to secure political compromises, noting that several draft versions of the FRL were
currently circulating in the Legislative Assembly. Improvements in PFM and fiscal transparency
are being considered as part of the FRL, building on recent progress in publishing more
comprehensive fiscal information through the Ministry of Finance’s transparency portal.

of electoral years, enhanced reporting by subnational
governments, explicit budgeting for tax refunds, reducing scope for short-term debt financing, provisioning to
save part of revenue over-performance during the budget year, and escape clauses from numerical targets due
to natural or security emergencies.

Assessment. The proposed FRL represents important progress. However, several revisions could significantly
improve the FRL.



Procedural improvements: (i) a “pay-as-you” go rule could be included for tax reductions or spending
initiatives that requires offsetting measures to preserve the primary deficit target and contain any withinyear spending drift (e.g., Colombia); (ii) an independent professional body to provide macroeconomic and
fiscal projections and limit the optimistic bias in budgetary projections (e.g., Chile); and (iii) a substantial
reduction in the constraints on spending to improve reallocational efficiency.



Numerical rules improvements. A more effective rules-based framework would include: (i) an adjustment
effort that would credibly deliver sustainable public debt; (ii) streamlining and prioritizing the multiple
numerical fiscal objectives—limited to either the overall debt or deficit—focusing on achieving debt
sustainability; (iii) an automatic corrective mechanism in this debt/deficit anchor to restore the fiscal
position on track following slippages; and (iv) broader escape clauses to cover economic emergencies.

BOOSTING GROWTH AND COMPETITIVENESS
19.
Headwinds to potential growth. A weak business environment (as typified by
El Salvador ranking 84 out of 144 in the Global Competitiveness Survey), combined with low
productivity and high crime, has depressed potential growth to about 2 percent., These factors
have discouraged domestic and foreign investment, undercut competitiveness, weakened activity
in the tradables sector, and fueled a large informal economy. Exports are relatively low and
undiversified both geographically (with the bulk going to the U.S. and Central America) and in
composition (concentrated in low value-added sectors and textiles). These growth headwinds are
exacerbated by the policy uncertainty associated with frequent election cycles.

Steps to boost potential growth. The authorities’ goal of reaching 3 percent growth on
a sustained basis is achievable if supported by far-reaching structural reforms that enhance
productivity and attract investment. There is a common diagnostic across the government and
the private sector on the important elements of such a growth-promoting strategy. These
include promoting economic diversification, reducing red-tape, increasing access to finance
(particularly for SMEs), improving access and lowering the costs of energy, enhancing legal and
physical security, and upgrading physical infrastructure. The 2014–19 Plan Quinquenal
appropriately seeks to promote job creation, education, and security. Staff discussed the
authorities’ productive transformation policy and welcomed their focus on promoting private
sector investment and tradable sector development. In addition, the FOMILENIO II grant offers
an opportunity to accelerate structural reforms to help raise productivity and competitiveness.
Steps to address organized crime, including by effectively implementing the AML/CFT and anticorruption frameworks, are also critical. Tangible progress to address these issues has, however,
been limited. Staff recommended moving quickly to resolve the remaining bottlenecks to
efficient implementation of investment projects, including PPPs, implementing the proposed
“regulatory guillotine” project to simplify business regulations, and channeling more resources to
SMEs via the development bank (BANDESAL).

Box 5. Tackling Inequality and Fostering Inclusive Growth
Poverty and inequality in El Salvador have improved but there is still a long way to go.
Inequality has fallen. El Salvador’s Gini declined from 54 in 2000 to
41 in 2012, helped by redistributive policies. Still, inequality remains
high by global standards (the global Gini is 37). Poverty has been
declining from 35 percent in 2005 to about 30 percent of the
population in 2013. Rural poverty has declined but remains about 10
percent higher than urban poverty. Inequalities also prevail in
education outcomes—average years of schooling are 9.2 years in
urban areas but only 5.6 years in rural areas. Illiteracy is also
significantly higher in rural areas.

Subsidies are mostly untargeted. Fuel subsidies are the highest in
the region, and electricity subsidies are third highest. Higher income
deciles benefit from about 40 percent of the LPG subsidies,
50 percent of electricity subsidies, and 70 percent of transportation
subsidies. In addition, 60 percent of cross subsidies on water mostly
accrue to (wealthier) urban consumers. Eliminating such subsidies
while providing a more generous safety net for poorer households
could generate fiscal savings of up to about 1 percent of GDP.
High informality impedes more inclusive growth. Informal
employment is about 60 percent of total employment (largely in
commerce, hotels, and restaurants). The informal economy is
characterized by low productivity, low labor quality, little worker
protection, and low and depreciating human capital. There are few
opportunities or incentives to move from the informal to the formal
sector even though such a move would allow firms to grow, be
more productive, and generate employment. Incentives for higher
formal labor market participation and lowering migration are key to
improving inequality and creating more inclusive growth.

Social spending is high and poorly targeted. Spending on
education, health, and social protection grew rapidly after 2008, and
is among the highest in Central America. However, untargeted
school uniform and food programs have accounted for much of the
increase in education spending, and about half of it accrues to
middle- and high-income households. Despite increased spending,
school enrollment rates and test scores have lagged. Likewise,
spending on health has increased but access to basic health services
for the poor remains limited. Improving efficiency of health and
education spending could bring sizeable gains in life expectancy (by
3 years) and school enrollment (25 additional students for every 100
students) at a relatively small fiscal cost (Grigoli (2014) and Grigoli
and Kapsoli (2013)).

21.
Tackling inequality. Important progress has been achieved in lowering poverty and
income inequality, but these indicators are far from where they need to be to establish a
reasonable standard of living (Box 5). Faster and sustained growth will help alleviate poverty and
inequality. However, given budget financing constraints, priority should be on (i) better targeting
and expanding coverage of the existing conditional cash transfer programs (which cover only a
third of those living in poverty); (ii) directing public resources toward raising the effectiveness of
health and post-primary education spending; and (iii) rationalizing subsidies to electricity and
LPG, since such subsidies largely accrue to higher income groups.
22.
Authorities’ views. The authorities noted that their productive transformation policy—
which identifies 6 priority sectors for development—will address the key bottlenecks to the
development of the tradable sector. They also pointed to specific plans in multiple areas
including electricity generation, light manufacturing, and tourism. PPP projects for airport
expansion and renewable energy were expected and a framework for such projects has been
legislated. Draft laws are also being prepared to reduce red-tape and provide legal stability by
guaranteeing unchanged regulations and taxes for a period of time for investors. The authorities
also expressed a strong commitment to maintaining and expanding their existing social
programs and prioritizing the financing of such programs.

BUILDING A ROBUST FINANCIAL SECTOR
23.
A broadly sound banking system. The mostly foreign-owned banking sector is highly
liquid and reports strong capital positions, with low non-performing loans (NPL) and high
provisioning (Figure 4). The shift to risk-based supervision is ongoing. Credit growth has been
moderate (7 percent in 2013–14), but partially funded by external borrowing in the absence of
corresponding deposit growth, creating an inherent vulnerability.
24.
Bolstering the institutional framework in the financial system: Implementation of
outstanding financial reforms recommended in the 2010 FSAP and the more recent Financial
Stability Strategy (Table 2) would strengthen the institutional underpinnings for financial sector
stability. Specifically:


The legal framework for bank resolution needs amending, including eliminating the
requirement to notify an affected bank 3 days before potential resolution measures are
implemented, and accelerating the provision of bank recovery and resolution plans for
each bank.



Additional funding needs to be secured to back the public LOLR facility, building on an
initial US$100 million credit line from the IDB. Also, a complementary Financial Stability
Liquidity Fund should be created by pooling a small part of banks’ required reserves. Use
of the latter mechanism should be conditioned on strict requirements on the solvency of
those banks that draw resources from the fund and a clear decision-making framework
to provide such support.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

EL SALVADOR



Crisis management procedures need improvement through an updated memorandum of
understanding between the central bank, the superintendency, and the deposit
guarantee institute to strengthen interagency cooperation and coordination. Establishing
a permanent financial sector stability committee with clear legal powers to decide on
systemic cases and help design prudential norms for systemic institutions would be a
critical step forward.



Developing a well-functioning secondary market for LETES, including building a yield
curve that could be monitored by market participants, would make public debt
instruments more liquid (particularly given LETES currently qualifies as a liquid asset for
the purposes of fulfilling the 3 percent Liquid Assets Requirement).

25.
Authorities’ views. The authorities highlighted their progress in improving the
institutional framework for financial stability. The central bank is exploring options to create a
pooled reserve fund that would be fuelled by an IFI credit line and a portion of the banks’ reserve
requirements. There is a need, however, to build broader political and societal support for such
measures in order to secure legislative approval.

STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
El Salvador’s growth has been modest and macroeconomic vulnerabilities are
rising. The persistently low growth reflects both domestic policy weaknesses and a fragile
external environment. Public debt dynamics are becoming unsustainable, the fiscal and current
account deficits have grown, and gross financing needs are sizable.
27.
The new government has an opportunity to build on the emerging broad social and
political consensus to address the economic imbalances and social challenges. There is
agreement on the need to strengthen the foundations for growth, address the country’s fiscal
imbalances, and deepen efforts to support the poor. Progress has been achieved in recent years
to raise tax revenues, lower inequality, and maintain financial stability, but significant challenges
remain. The ongoing parliamentary discussion of the draft FRL has brought fiscal issues to the
forefront. However, the support for the necessary fiscal adjustment is lacking, and social and
political pressures ahead of the 2015 congressional elections are delaying effective policymaking.
28.
An ambitious fiscal adjustment that protects social spending should be a top
priority. With medium-term gross financing needs projected to remain high, policies must focus
on mitigating potential risks posed by a future increase in global risk aversion or higher global
interest rates. A fiscal adjustment of around 3½ percent of GDP over the next three years will
help maintain access to market financing on favorable terms and place debt on a sustainable
path, while reducing the risks of a disorderly macroeconomic adjustment. The adjustment would
likely have an adverse growth impact, but it could accelerate to 3 percent in the medium term
with the benefit of supply-side reforms. The fiscal adjustment should occur alongside an increase
in targeted social spending to protect the most vulnerable and lessen income inequality. A
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

EL SALVADOR

broader strategy will also be needed to attain a sustainable pension system and strengthen
budget procedures.
29.
A better business environment is imperative to enable private-sector led growth.
Raising potential growth to 3 percent is an achievable goal but will require determined and
ambitious supply-side reforms that substantially raise productivity and competitiveness and
improve security. The envisaged steps to bolster public investment and promote economic
transformation by diversifying the energy matrix, prioritizing key manufacturing and tradable
service sectors, and upgrading infrastructure. Reforms to reduce red-tape and bureaucracy,
increase financing for SMEs, improve access to energy and lower its costs, and better security
should be quickly legislated to attract high-quality private investment. FOMILENIO II offers an
opportunity to accelerate such reforms.
30.
Improving the institutional framework for the banking sector is important. Financial
indicators generally appear sound, a product of ongoing prudent supervision and regulation.
Nonetheless, there is still scope to upgrade the legal framework for bank resolution and install an
appropriately funded safety net for the banks.
31.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV Consultation be held on the standard 12month cycle.

Table 1. Risk Assessment Matrix1
Source of risk

Geopolitical fragmentation that
erodes the globalization process
and fosters inefficiency: Heightened
risk of fragmentation/state failure in
the Middle East, leading to a sharp
rise in oil prices, with negative
spillovers to the global economy.

Side-effects from global financial
conditions: an abrupt surge in
global financial market volatility.

Protracted period of slower growth
in advanced and emerging
economies.

Further weakening of the fiscal
position

Political fragmentation and
worsening security

Natural disasters

Up/Downside

Likelihood

↓

Medium. Geopolitical risks in the
Middle East could lead to a sharp
rise in oil prices, with negative
spillovers to the global economy.
In the case of El Salvador, its
energy matrix heavily relies on oil
imports.

↓

↓

↓

↓

↓

High. Revised market
expectations on UMP exit in the
US could trigger higher global
interest rates and/or a sustained
reversal of capital flows with high
risk premiums across vulnerable
markets.

High. Slower growth in the US
(main trading partner of El
Salvador) and regional trading
partners.

Medium Given upcoming
elections in March 2015.

Medium. El Salvador is exposed
to frequent electoral cycles. Also,
security, which is one of the worst
across the region, is among the
critical factors affecting the
business climate.

Medium. El Salvador is exposed
to earthquakes, floods, droughts,
and hurricanes.

Impact

High. A sharp increase in oil
prices would worsen the trade
balance due to the high
dependence on oil imports.

Policy response

Allow full pass-through and
strengthen targeted social safety
net, including targeted
assistance, to protect the
vulnerable. Over the mediumterm increase reliance on
renewable sources of energy.

High. A global interest rate
shock would both constrain
access to international capital
markets in the context of
elevated financing needs and
worsen public debt dynamics
(almost half of public debt is
linked to the US LIBOR).

Implement fiscal consolidation to
both reduce external financing
needs and improve debt
dynamics. Improve fiscal and
external buffers.

Medium/High. A slowdown in
the US would reduce El
Salvador's exports, remittances
inflows, and GDP growth.

Given limited fiscal space,
implement refroms to attract
private investment, including
better business climate, export
diversification, and
competitiveness. Strengthen tax
administration and expenditure
management to protect the fiscal
position.

High. Fiscal slippages will
worsen macroeconomic
imbalances and affect confident
economic growth.

Implement fiscal consolidation to
both reduce external financing
needs and improve debt
dynamics.

Medium. Political paralysis will
exacerbate macroeconomic
imbalances because of
ineffective policy making. Lack
of security would adversely
affect investment.

Broad based policy dialogue to
support macroeconomic stability.
Develop and implement coherent
and comprehensive policies to
improve domestic security,
including by effectively
implementing the AML and anticorruption frameworks.

Medium/High. The economic
impact could be significant
through its effects on economic
growth and fiscal pressures.

Ensure that fiscal buffers
(including official loans) are
adequate to support vulnerable
segments of the population.
Prepare and assess enrollment in
insurance schemes against
natural disasters.

1 The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of
risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and
30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the
authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Annex I. Implementation of Fund Policy Advice
The 2013 Article IV Consultation focused on the need to ensure economic stability during the
government transition in mid-2014 and tackle longer-term challenges. Directors recommended:
 Facilitating a nation-wide dialogue on short- and medium-term growth priorities,
including developing a medium-term growth agenda. The process is still at an early stage since
the government took office in June.
 Implementing fiscal consolidation to lower the deficits by 1 percentage point of GDP
annually in 2013–14 to stabilize the public debt ratio. Consolidation efforts have not borne fruit
and the 2013–14 deficits have stayed at around 4 percent of GDP with debt-GDP continuing to
rise. The draft Fiscal Responsibility Law commits to a cumulative adjustment of 1½ percent of
GDP over 3 years, which is insufficient to prevent a steadily increasing debt-GDP ratio.
 Pursuing comprehensive pension reform to ensure sustainability and reduce inequalities in
the system. There have been no policy steps to address imbalances in the pension system.
 Completing financial sector reform agenda, by fully funding the central bank’s new liquidity
framework, including the LOLR facility, and raising reserves of the deposit insurance fund to
strengthen the financial safety net. Partial progress has been made on funding the LOLR facility
with a US$100 credit line from IDB but there has been no progress on deposit insurance.

Annex II. External Assessment1
Based on quantitative indicators, El Salvador’s real effective exchange rate (REER) is assessed to be
modestly overvalued by 2–9 percent. Non-price indicators also point to diminished competitiveness.

El Salvador’s CPI-based REER has depreciated by
7.6 percent since end-2001. However, this decline
masks a real depreciation with respect to most
regional trade partners that was offset by a
9 percent real appreciation vis-à-vis the U.S. (El
Salvador’s largest trading partner buying
47 percent of exports). Since end-2012, the small
appreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate
has been more than offset by the decline in relative
inflation.

The External Balance Assessment (EBA-lite)—
Source: Fund staff estimates.
based on existing fundamentals and desirable
policies—suggests an overvaluation of about 2½ percent. The methodology points to a
cyclically-adjusted current account norm of 5½ percent of GDP, which is about 1 percentage point
smaller than the actual deficit of 6½ percent in 2013. This gap mainly reflects fiscal and reserve
adequacy policy gaps. The identified fiscal gap is a significant contributor to El Salvador’s current
account gap. However, these estimates should be treated cautiously since the methodology does
not account for dollarization and its implication for reserve adequacy.
CGER-like methods indicate an REER overvaluation in the range of 2 to 9 percent.
The macro balance approach (based on
medium-term fundamentals) points to an
overvaluation of about 2½ percent.

Other indicators suggest a clear problem with competitiveness, some part of which may be
linked to an overvalued exchange rate. FDI and exports are the lowest in the region. FDI has
averaged 2.3 percent of GDP since 2005, peaking in 2007 from banking sector investments. In 2013,
nearly three-quarters of total FDI was in non-tradables, one of the highest shares in the region.
Exports of goods and services are only 24 percent of GDP compared to 33 and 43 percent in
Honduras and Nicaragua, respectively. Also, while total exports have risen in recent years, the
growth rate is among the lowest in the region.

El Salvador’s exports are highly concentrated in both destination and composition. The top
5 export destinations (U.S., Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica) account for almost 80
percent of all exports. No other country in the region trades as much with CAPDR— El Salvador
exports 40 percent to the regional block followed by Guatemala with 26 percent. El Salvador’s
exports are also concentrated in relatively low value-added and labor intensive goods, which are
likely to be sensitive to the relative valuation of the exchange rate (40 percent of exports are
clustered in low-end textiles). While El Salvador’s market share of textiles (apparel) in the U.S. has
increased by over 50 percent since 2005, it has declined by over a third in Central America and
Panama. El Salvador’s market share in commodities (mostly coffee and sugar) has in general
increased but accounts for a much smaller portion of its total export basket (8 percent).

El Salvador’s business environment has deteriorated. According to the World Bank’s Doing
Business indicators, El Salvador shows a low ranking in investor protection, starting a business, tax
payment, dealing with construction payments and contract enforcement.2 The World Economic
Forum’s competitiveness index has shown some improvement particularly in 2013 (e.g. intellectual
property protection, transparency of government policymaking, efficiency of legal framework,
infrastructure, goods market efficiency, business sophistication and innovation). Nevertheless, it also
points to an erosion in labor market efficiency (i.e., in the flexibility of wage determination and pay
and productivity) and the institutional environment (notably weaker investor protections and the rise
of organized crime and general business costs). According to the World Bank’s enterprise survey,
El Salvador has the highest proportion of firms paying for security with average security costs equal
to about 3.4 percent of annual sales, the highest in the region after Honduras.

The investment climate faces multiple bottlenecks. These include security, legal stability, red tape
(government bureaucracy), infrastructure services (transport, logistics and customs), access to
financing (especially for SMEs), and low access and high cost of energy. The authorities are
addressing some of these bottlenecks in the context of its Productive Transformation Policy (PTP).3
They have drafting new legislation to address some of these issues (e.g., red tape to facilitate private
sector investment, electronic signature and legal stability). The development bank (BANDESAL) also
plans to channel more resources to SMEs. Finally, the implementation of energy projects would
increase the reliability and lower the cost of energy over the medium-term.

2

These indicators should be interpreted with caution due to a limited number of respondents, a limited geographical
coverage, and standardized assumptions on business constraints and information availability.
3

The PTP has identified productive sectors with higher value added and comparative advantages in international
markets (vertical policies), and also bottlenecks that are common across sectors (transversal policies).

Annex III. El Salvador: Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
1
(Higher Scrutiny Case)
The DSA highlights El Salvador’s unsustainable debt dynamics under current policies. The drivers
include high primary deficits, low growth, and rising interest rates. The relatively high financing needs
and large contingent pension liabilities are key vulnerabilities in the fully dollarized economy.
Downside risks from growth and global interest rate shocks are partly mitigated by the relatively long
maturity of existing debt and a stable investor base.

A. Key Assumptions
Debt definition. El Salvador’s public debt is defined as the sum of gross debt of nonfinancial public
sector (including pension-related debt) and external debt of the central bank (1 percent of GDP). This
definition better captures quasi-fiscal liabilities (relating to public enterprises and the public financial
sector) due to the large role of a fiscal backstop under a dollarized economy’s funding constraints.
Growth. The baseline reflects the estimated growth potential of 2 percent. Susceptibility to shocks
(including natural disasters and external spillovers especially from the U.S.) is a downside risk.
Fiscal policy and financing. Under current policies, the primary deficit remains broadly constant.
The headline deficit would increase above 5 percent of GDP in the medium term, due to the higher
interest bill from the rising debt and (US LIBOR-dependent) servicing costs. The baseline assumes
that unidentified financing gaps are filled with long-term loans from official and private creditors.
Alternatively, the debt profile could become riskier, reflecting a growing share of short-term debt.

B. Results and Assessment
Results. Under current policies, public debt would be over
70 percent of GDP by 2019, staying on an upward
trajectory thereafter.2 The gross financing needs would
average above 8 percent of GDP, increasing to 11 percent
by 2019 due to a Eurobond repayment. The authorities’
draft fiscal responsibility law would imply a cumulative
adjustment of 1½ percent of GDP. Debt dynamics under
this scenario would be more benign than under the
baseline, but would still imply a debt of 66 percent of GDP
in 2024 and rising thereafter. This would be well above the
assessed sustainable level of public debt.

Drivers. The upward debt dynamic is driven by high real interest rates and primary deficits
(contributing about 2 and 1½ percent of GDP respectively on an annual basis). Real GDP growth
would reduce the ratio by a little more than 1¼ percent of GDP annually.

Assessment. Most standard debt profile characteristics are at or close to “danger” levels (see heatmap). The heat-map may also be understating some risks: (i) the threshold for gross financing (15
percent of GDP) does not take into account funding constraints of dollarization, whereby there is no
backstop for LOLR or other shocks; (ii) the indicator of change in short-term external debt in 2013 is
favorably impacted by the one-off repayment of LETES from the stock of reserves (since the
repayment did not improve the underlying debt sustainability position); and (iii) the measured share
of “foreign currency” debt (close to zero) reflects the legal adoption of the US dollar, not the implied
benefits of issuing own-currency liabilities.
Mitigating factors. Existing debt has a relatively long average debt maturity (12 years) and a stable
investor base (over a half of the debt is held by domestic pension funds and official creditors). In the
latter aspect, the heat-map may overstate risks from “nonresident holdings.”
Stress tests. Real GDP, interest rate, and contingent liability shocks have a significant impact. The

15 percent of GDP in 2019.
Idiosyncratic risks and issues: These include: (i) A potential one-off downward revision of nominal
GDP; (ii) unfunded pension-related liabilities, estimated at 94 percent of GDP in NPV terms; (iii) the
potential assumption of enterprise debt; and (iv) contingent liabilities from PPP projects (the legal
cumulative ceiling for PPPs has been set at 3 percent of GDP, but it could be increased up to
5 percent in some circumstances). In addition, some of the pension bonds already issued (the socalled CIP-B series), equivalent to 6 percent of GDP, should also be recognized as public debt.
Long-term debt and pensions. Projections were extended to 2030. Assuming a constant primary
deficit at the 2019 level, debt would continue growing rapidly, exceeding 100 percent of GDP by
2030, with the overall deficit exceeding 7 percent of GDP. El Salvador’s pension system would be a
key additional driver of debt dynamics and would increase the deficit by an annual average of ½
percent of GDP during 2015–30 relative to the baseline, and steadily increase fiscal spending.
Authorities’ views. In addition to considering staff's growth and interest rate assumptions to be
pessimistic, the authorities also regarded gross national disposable income (which would include the
high remittance flows), rather than GDP, to be a better measure to gauge the country's capacity to
repay.

Source: Fund staff estimates and projections.
1/ Public sector is defined as non-financial public sector.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over U.S. bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

yellow if country value is between the lower and upper risk-assessment benchmarks. If data are unavailable or indicator is not relevant, cell is white.
Lower and upper risk-assessment benchmarks are:
200 and 600 basis points for bond spreads; 5 and 15 percent of GDP for external financing requirement; 0.5 and 1 percent for change in the share of short-term debt; 15
and 45 percent for the public debt held by non-residents; and 20 and 60 percent for the share of foreign-currency denominated debt.
4/ Long-term bond spread over U.S. bonds, an average over the last 3 months, 09-Aug-14 through 07-Nov-14.
5/ External financing requirement is defined as the sum of current account deficit, amortization of medium and long-term total external debt, and short-term total external
debt at the end of previous period.

Exchange Rate Arrangement. The U.S. dollar is legal tender and circulates freely. The dollar is used
as a unit of account and a medium of exchange, with no limitations. All payments may be made in
either dollars or colones. The BCR has the obligation to exchange colones for dollars upon request
from banks, at a fixed and unalterable exchange rate of C8.75 per U.S. dollar. As a result, El Salvador
has an exchange rate arrangement with no separate legal tender category. El Salvador has accepted
the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system that is free
of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.

EL SALVADOR

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
1.
Collaboration. In the context of the joint management action plan (JMAP) for Bank-Fund
collaboration, the IMF team met on several occasions with the World Bank team to discuss
El Salvador’s main macroeconomic challenges, identify macro-critical structural reforms, and
coordinate the work of both teams.
2.
Macroeconomic challenges. The teams have agreed that the challenges facing El Salvador
are to safeguard fiscal sustainability, deepen financial reforms, boost growth and shared prosperity.
The priority is to place the public debt-to-GDP ratio on a sustainable path and reduce the
government’s financing needs. Improvements in competitiveness and the business climate are
needed to unleash the growth potential of the dollarized economy and elevate standards of living.
3.
Structural reforms. Based on this shared assessment, the teams have identified four macrocritical structural reform areas:


Fiscal sustainability. The fiscal consolidation strategy should comprise expenditure and
revenue reforms to lower the fiscal deficit, while raising infrastructure, security, and other
social spending. In particular, the increase in current primary spending recorded since the
global crisis of 2008–09 should be reversed, including subsidies and wages, and the tax
effort should be aligned with country peers. The pension system should also be put on a
sound financial footing.



Public financial management. The focus should be on addressing shortcomings in the
budget process, including by: (i) adopting a medium-term expenditure framework;
(ii) introducing a unified budget for the nonfinancial public sector; and (iii) broadening
coverage of autonomous and decentralized institutions. Resolving these weaknesses will
improve the ability to control public expenditure and execute the investment budget.



Financial system. The priority should be to strengthen its crisis preparedness and increase
financial intermediation by: (i) making operational the central bank’s lender-of-last-resort
facility and setting up an additional liquidity fund; (ii) shifting to risk-based supervision and
improving cross-border consolidated supervision; (iii) addressing deficiencies in bank
resolution procedures and strengthening the deposit insurance scheme; and (iv) improving
the legal framework for El Salvador’s capital markets.



Competitiveness. There is a need to boost domestic investment in El Salvador, which for
many years has remained low in terms of GDP and compared to regional peers. Weaknesses
in areas such as security, education, and innovation, and lack of private participation in large
infrastructure projects weigh on investment and growth.

4.

Division of labor. The teams agreed on the following division of labor:



Fiscal sustainability. The IMF (the Fund) will continue to provide advice on macro-fiscal
issues, including fiscal consolidation, and technical assistance (TA) to strengthen tax
collection and reduce evasion. Building upon previous tax policy TA, the Fund support will
focus on improving control of large taxpayers and enhancing auditing capacity, as well as
strengthening customs control while facilitating trade through risk-management schemes.



Public financial management. The Fund will further assist the authorities in implementing
medium-term expenditure framework, setting up a treasury single account, and enhancing
capabilities in debt sustainability analysis. The World Bank is undertaking a regional study on
public expenditure review in the social sector in Central America.



Financial system. The Bank and the Fund will continue to cooperate as needed in assisting
the authorities to implement the 2010 FSAP Update advice. The Fund will provide assistance
with norms and procedures to shift to risk-based supervision, cross-border consolidation
supervision, and the liquidity policy of the central bank. The Bank will provide new assistance
on the regulatory framework for the provision of mobile financial services and insurance.



Competitiveness. The Fund will also assist in strengthening the framework for publicprivate partnerships and managing potential fiscal risks through regional seminars. The
World Bank has also been working to strengthen the legal framework for public-private
partnerships and to improve the investment climate. The World Bank is also providing TA to
build the institutional capacity for technology and innovation.

5.
Information sharing. The teams have agreed to share information on progress in the above
macro-critical structural reform areas.
6.

Work programs. The following table lists the teams’ work programs through April 2014.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of October 2014)

A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: National accounts data are based on 1990 weights and compiled under the
1968 SNA, although a project is underway to transition to the 1993 SNA and the most important
recommendations of 2008 SNA for the country, with 2005 as new reference year. The project also
envisages the publication of quarterly national accounts by expenditure, which are currently
available only on an annual basis.

B. Data Standards and Quality
El Salvador is a subscriber to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since 1998.
El Salvador is taking a flexibility option for the periodicity of the labor market and wages/earnings
data category and will continue at this time to publish annual data with a timeliness of one quarter
after the end of the reference year. A data ROSC was published in December 2004.

Press Release No. 14/567
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 11, 2014

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with El Salvador
On December 11, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with El Salvador1 and considered and endorsed the
staff appraisal without a meeting.2
Background
El Salvador’s growth—driven by private consumption—has continued to lag the Central
American region. In 2013, growth decelerated to 1.7 percent, as private consumption slowed
against weaker remittances. Growth accelerated slightly to 2 percent in the first half of 2014
as remittances recovered. Inflation—anchored by full dollarization—has remained low at 1-2
percent.
The fiscal deficit has remained high and external imbalance has risen since 2010. Despite
strong revenue performance through 2013, the fiscal deficit has remained at 4 percent of
GDP due to higher wage bill and current transfers. The resulting tight financing situation has
lowered public investment and caused an accumulation of payment arrears; the latter reduced
sizably following the issuance of a US$800 million Eurobond in September. However, public
debt is set to reach 60 percent of GDP by end-2014. The rising current account deficit
reflects a decline in private saving/investment balance and sustained fiscal deficits. In 2013,
it reached 6½ percent of GDP as exports faced broad-based weaknesses. The external
position is, however, improving in 2014 due to lower imports, services exports, recovering
remittances, and the recent drop in oil prices.
The banking system is broadly sound. The mostly foreign-owned banking sector is highly
liquid and reports strong capital positions, with low non-performing loans and high

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every
year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's
economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for
discussion by the Executive Board.

considered without convening formal discussions.

provisioning. Credit growth has been moderate (7 percent in 2013–14), but partially funded
by external borrowing in the absence of corresponding deposit growth.
Under current policies, growth is expected to be around 2 to 2¼ percent in 2014-15, and
reach about 2½ percent in 2016–18 reflecting private and public investment projects
expected to come on stream. The ongoing reduction in external current account deficit would
unwind in the medium term partly as the fiscal deficit is projected to widen to 5½ percent of
GDP and public debt would rise above 70 percent of GDP by 2019.
Key risks include global uncertainties linked to the normalization of U.S. monetary policy or
a deteriorating economic outlook for advanced and emerging markets, which could interact
with domestic fiscal and external vulnerabilities. On the upside, a more sustained fall in oil
prices could lessen external imbalances and have some positive growth effects, while betterthan-expected growth in the U.S. would have positive spillovers to El Salvador. In addition,
promoting regional cooperation, including under the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern
Triangle, could also attract further private investment and provide sustained job creation.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2014 Article IV consultation with El Salvador, Executive Directors
endorsed staff’s appraisal as follows:
El Salvador’s growth has been modest and macroeconomic vulnerabilities are rising. The
persistently low growth reflects both domestic policy weaknesses and a fragile external
environment. Public debt dynamics are becoming unsustainable, the fiscal and current
account deficits have grown, and gross financing needs are sizable.
The new government has an opportunity to build on the emerging broad social and political
consensus to address the economic imbalances and social challenges. There is agreement on
the need to strengthen the foundations for growth, address the country’s fiscal imbalances,
and deepen efforts to support the poor. Progress has been achieved in recent years to raise tax
revenues, lower inequality, and maintain financial stability, but significant challenges remain.
The ongoing parliamentary discussion of the draft Fiscal Responsibility Law has brought
fiscal issues to the forefront. However, the support for the necessary fiscal adjustment is
lacking, and social and political pressures ahead of the 2015 congressional elections are
delaying effective policymaking.
An ambitious fiscal adjustment that protects social spending should be a top priority. With
medium-term gross financing needs projected to remain high, policies must focus on
mitigating potential risks posed by a future increase in global risk aversion or higher global
interest rates. A fiscal adjustment of around 3½ percent of GDP over the next three years will
help maintain access to market financing on favorable terms and place debt on a sustainable
path, while reducing the risks of a disorderly macroeconomic adjustment. The adjustment

3

would likely have an adverse growth impact, but it could accelerate to 3 percent in the
medium term with the benefit of supply-side reforms. The fiscal adjustment should occur
alongside an increase in targeted social spending to protect the most vulnerable and lessen
income inequality. A broader strategy will also be needed to attain a sustainable pension
system and strengthen budget procedures.
A better business environment is imperative to enable private-sector led growth. Raising
potential growth to 3 percent is an achievable goal but will require determined and ambitious
supply-side reforms that substantially raise productivity and competitiveness and improve
security. The envisaged steps aim to bolster public investment and promote economic
transformation by diversifying the energy matrix, prioritizing key manufacturing and tradable
service sectors, and upgrading infrastructure. Reforms to reduce red-tape and bureaucracy,
increase financing for SMEs, improve access to energy and lower its costs, and better
security should be quickly legislated to attract high-quality private investment. FOMILENIO
II offers an opportunity to accelerate such reforms.
Improving the institutional framework for the banking sector is important. Financial
indicators generally appear sound, a product of ongoing prudent supervision and regulation.
Nonetheless, there is still scope to upgrade the legal framework for bank resolution and
install an appropriately funded safety net for the banks.

STATEMENT OF THE ECONOMIC AUTHORITIES OF EL SALVADOR REGARDING THE 2014 IMF ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION

First, we would like to thank the staff of the International Monetary Fund for the visit to El Salvador in October
of last year, which had the primary purpose of conducting a short- and medium-term assessment of economic
growth, the fiscal situation and the pension system, the external sector, and the financial system. We are also
grateful for the technical and professional rigor of the staff of the mission headed by Uma Ramakrishnan.
In general, we are in agreement with many of the assessments in the IMF report that recognize the country’s
advances in the areas of poverty reduction, enacted tax reforms, reforms that have enhanced the investment
incentives, and anti-money laundering measures. We also share the assessment of the major challenges facing
the country such as boosting economic growth, private investment, public investment, and social expenditure,
as well as the opportunities that the current government must continue to use in order to make gradual
progress on the structural correction of macroeconomic imbalances and achieve sustained growth that yields
decent jobs, better education with social inclusion, and strengthened security. Such are the priorities of the
2014-2019 Five-Year Development Plan, which aims to achieve a more productive, educated, and secure
country.
However, as regards the Fund’s macroeconomic and fiscal projections made at the time of the mission, it is
important to note that recently there have been significant changes in international commodity prices and
stronger growth in the U.S. economy, which confirm the government’s more optimistic assessment as
reflected in its projections. These factors are positively impacting the country’s domestic and external
economic position, as reflected in increased demand for goods, lower inflation and energy prices – and the
resulting effect on purchasing power and competitiveness, lower costs of inputs and raw materials for
industries and activities that use petroleum products, lower expenditures on subsidies on public
transportation and liquid petroleum gas, which could conceivably continue to shrink without any impact on
the number of beneficiaries, and a reduction in the external sector deficit. Similarly, our authorities believe
that an increase in international interest rates is unlikely to materialize in the short term.

Based on the projections of public and private investment and of the implementation of strategic projects
considered in the Five-Year Development Plan – diversification of the production and energy matrices,
reduction of energy costs, simplification of bureaucratic procedures, and expansion of the logistical and road
infrastructure, among others – we are convinced that it will be possible to achieve a sustained rate of
economic growth of 3 percent in the next five years.
The economic authorities also do not agree with the fiscal adjustment target of 3.5 percent of GDP proposed
by the Fund nor with its speed (3 years), as this would have a negative impact on growth and on the
socioeconomic conditions of the poorest and most vulnerable segments of the population, which could in turn
affect the governability of the country.
Regarding the pension system, a concerted process of comprehensive reform will be implemented, which
would guarantee the right to a decent pension and the system’s financial sustainability; gradually provide
universal coverage, especially in excluded sectors; and function within a framework of equity and solidaritybased collective and individual protection. These reforms will reduce the pressure on public finances currently
exerted by the pension system.

Finally, we agree with the Fund on the importance of moving forward with a comprehensive process of
dialogue with the main sectors of society, which would permit to conclude basic agreements around a national
agenda on key development issues such as growth, fiscal sustainability, and pension system reform.
