Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2008 Article IV Consultation with Tonga
Approved by Jeremy V. Carter and Anthony Boote
June 17, 2008

• Discussions: Nuku’alofa, April 9–18, 2008. The team met with Prime Minister Sevele,
Minister of Finance Matoto, National Reserve Bank of Tonga Governor Mafi, and other
senior government officials, as well as private sector representatives.
• Team: Mses. Liu (Head), Fujita, and Mr. Vitek (all APD). Ms. Cocker (OED) joined
the discussions.
• Past surveillance: The 2007 Article IV Consultation was completed on July 11, 2007.
Executive Directors’ views and comments can be found at
http://www.imf.org/external/country/TON/index.htm.
• Focus of discussions: Near-term macroeconomic policies should be geared toward
reviving growth while containing inflation and vulnerability. Over the medium term,
policies will need to aim at putting the budget on a sound footing, improving debt
dynamics, and promoting investment and structural reform to boost private sector-driven
growth.
• Outreach: The mission held a press conference on April 18, and also met with
business, donor, and diplomatic representatives.
• Exchange rate: Basket peg to the U.S., Australian, and New Zealand dollars and
Japanese yen, with monthly adjustment band of ±5 percent.
• Exchange system: Accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. The
authorities plan to retain the exchange restriction in the form of a tax certification
requirement applied to various current international transactions, and agreed to review this
requirement in the context of the 2009 Article IV consultation discussions. The Board
approved this restriction until July 9, 2008 or the 2008 Article IV consultation, whichever
is earlier. At this point, staff does not propose an approval of this restriction.
• Statistics: Data quality, coverage, and timeliness have been hampered by several
deficiencies, including capacity constraints, which have complicated effective surveillance.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background: Tonga’s economy has shown resilience in the aftermath of the November 2006 riots,
with policies and strong remittances underpinning the recent recovery. Government reconstruction
loans and the King’s coronation in August 2008 may provide additional growth stimulus. However,
the global upswings in fuel and food prices have intensified pressures on inflation and external
reserves. Outward migration has been substantial, and strong remittances have become the key
mitigating factor to external shocks. Near-term growth prospects are favorable, but risks remain,
particularly from further hikes in world food and fuel prices.
Main Issues: Adverse terms-of-trade shocks have complicated economic management in delivering
low inflation and stable growth, while safeguarding external stability. As recognized by the authorities,
it is important to improve Tonga’s resilience to external shocks through rebalancing the policy mix
toward a tighter monetary stance, supported by fiscal prudence and increased exchange rate flexibility.
Staff’s Views: Rebalancing the policy mix would improve the macroeconomic framework to address
concerns of rising inflation and external vulnerability.
•

On the fiscal front, a balanced budget in FY07/08 is likely to be achieved, and maintaining
this stance in FY08/09 is crucial to sharing the burden of macroeconomic management while
generating fiscal savings to buffer increases in debt service over the medium term. Achieving
this objective will require sustainable fiscal measures to further improve tax administration
and rationalize capital spending in line with donor financing and Tonga’s implementation
capacity. Moving toward a more orderly public wage policy is also critical to reduce fiscal
vulnerability arising from ad hoc and large wage adjustments experienced in the past.

•

The joint WB/IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis suggests that with the proposed reconstruction
loan, Tonga remains at a high risk of debt distress, mitigated by large remittance inflows. Debt
sustainability hinges on a phased utilization of the loan in line with the medium-term fiscal
framework to support capital projects that will generate growth and employment opportunities.
Tonga should rely as much as possible on donor grants to finance future development.

•

Early actions to tighten monetary policy are warranted to anchor inflation expectations in
advance of the finalization of the FY08/09 budget. Monetary tightening should be achieved
through the use of effective, market-based instruments, including the issuance of central bank
notes.

•

Rebalancing the policy mix would support increased exchange rate flexibility to safeguard
reserves while keeping inflation under control, as well as help correct a likely modest
overvaluation of the pa’anga to ensure external stability over the medium term.

Authorities’ Views: There was broad agreement on issues and policy requirements. The authorities
are aiming at a balanced budget and will take additional measures if needed to ensure the target is met.
On the monetary front, the authorities acknowledged that inflation has already exceeded their comfort
zone of single digit levels. They are committed to tightening monetary policy, if necessary, to
safeguard reserves and contain inflation. They noted that the magnitude of exchange rate depreciation
will be carefully considered given its inflationary impact.

4
INTRODUCTION
1.
Tonga’s economy has shown resilience in the aftermath of the November 2006
riots and is now on a path to recovery.1 The key factor underpinning resilience has been
private investment. Donor supported government reconstruction loans are expected to add
further momentum to the recovery. The King’s coronation in August 2008 may also provide
additional growth stimulus. Political stability seems to have been restored, and the
parliamentary election in late April 2008 did not generate any marked discontent.
2.
The global upswings in fuel and food prices, however, have intensified pressures
on inflation and external reserves, the latter mitigated to a large extent by strong
inflows of remittances. Tonga continues to rely heavily on imports, mostly of food and fuel,
while its export base remains narrow, making the trade balance highly vulnerable to major
external price shocks. With limited employment opportunities, outward migration has been
substantial, and remittances from abroad have risen steadily. Remittances are now the key
mitigating factor to external shocks.
3.
The economy continues to face structural and policy impediments that
undermine growth. Over the past decade, real GDP growth averaged 1.9 percent,
underperforming most other Pacific Island countries (PICs). High costs of labor and energy,
limited export diversification, and the lack of long-term investment to improve productivity
and efficiency are among the main factors that continue to impede high sustainable growth.
4.
Against this background, discussions centered on the appropriate policy mix to
improve the economy’s resilience to external shocks, supported by medium-term
structural reforms to improve growth potential. Staff recommendations would facilitate
progress toward achieving the authorities’ objectives of lowering inflation and maintaining
external stability, while supporting economic recovery under a less favorable global
environment.
I. ECONOMIC AND POLICY DEVELOPMENTS
Background
5.
Tonga’s output growth was severely disrupted in FY06/07 (ending June),
following the November 2006 riots. Policies and strong remittances have underpinned the
recent recovery (Table 1).

1

Tonga’s constitutional monarchy was challenged by a vocal force calling for a move toward more democracy
following the death of the previous King Topou IV in September 2006. In November 2006, the government’s
rejection of a proposal to increase popular representation in parliament sparked riots in the capital city,
Nuku’alofa, with estimates of losses in infrastructure and inventories exceeding 10 percent of GDP.

inflation appears to be on a rising trend

in early 2007 may have also played a role. The impact of the public wage settlement on
inflation was somewhat offset by retrenchment of about 20 percent of total civil service
workers (Tables 2 and 3).

Outlook and Risks
6.
Prospects for economic recovery are favorable, but with downside risks,
particularly from further hikes in world fuel and food prices in the near term (Table 5).
•

Near term: Real GDP is projected to expand by 1¼ percent in FY07/08, underpinned by a
recovery in private domestic demand, while the contribution of external demand to
growth remains negative. Inflation is expected to remain high at above 10 percent over
the next few months, reflecting the combined effect of the pass-through of higher fuel and
food prices and a further modest depreciation of the pa’anga against the currencies of
Tonga’s major trading partners.

•

Medium term: Real GDP growth is expected to reach 2¾ percent in FY08/09 as
reconstruction activity gains momentum, and to return to its long-run average of
1¾ percent over the medium term. Inflation is expected to trend downward as world
prices of fuel and food are projected to stabilize over the medium term (based on the
WEO assumptions).

•

Near-term risks: On the upside, the King’s coronation in August 2008 is likely to
stimulate growth through rising remittances, hotel occupancy, and consumption spending
in the run-up to the event. On the downside, high fuel and food prices could entrench high
inflation and intensify external vulnerability, weakening domestic confidence and real
economic activity. The King’s coronation could also possibly lead to spending overrun in
the budget.

•

Medium-term risks: Tonga has untapped growth potential, especially in tourism, and a
strong base to support remittances, which could be channeled to productive investment,
including for export diversification. However, competition in tourism could be stiff,
especially from Fiji where tourism infrastructure and services are significantly more
developed. Continued adverse terms-of-trade shocks and the reemergence of wage
pressures are major risks to fiscal and external sustainability. Tonga’s constitutional
reform toward a democratic system could also potentially spark tensions when the process
begins in 2010.

The Authorities’ Views
7.
The authorities broadly concurred with these assessments. However, they expect
food inflation in Tonga to be somewhat contained as Tonga remains largely a subsistencesupported economy, and if price differentials become significant, Tongans are highly likely to
replace the imported food with locally produced root crops. The rising world fuel prices,
however, could have a significant impact on inflation as electricity generation in Tonga is
entirely fuel based. Moreover, at an average of about two cars per family, higher oil prices
could force substitution away from imported food in order to maintain levels of petrol
consumption.

7
II. POLICIES TO IMPROVE RESILIENCE AND SUSTAIN RECOVERY
In response to significant adverse terms-of-trade shocks, rebalancing the policy mix toward a
tighter monetary stance, supported by fiscal prudence and increased exchange rate
flexibility, would address concerns of rising inflation while safeguarding external stability.
A. Ensuring Fiscal Prudence
Background
8.
A balanced budget in FY07/08 is likely to be achieved, but maintaining this
stance in FY08/09 will be challenging in the absence of new measures.
•

Significant efforts have been made to achieve a balanced budget in FY07/08. During the
first nine months of FY07/08, revenue performance remained buoyant, boosted by a
recovery of arrears and a containment

to support higher maintenance and
capital spending. At the same time, the budget also focuses on improving business
competitiveness through a reduction in the maximum tariff rate to 20 percent (from
45 percent). In addition, it aimed at supporting household disposable income by lifting the
individual income tax exemption threshold to TOP7,400 (from TOP2,500), together with
a reduction in the corporate tax rate for large taxpayers.

Policy Issues and Staff Views
9.
Continued fiscal prudence is warranted to share the burden of macroeconomic
management to ensure domestic and external stability in the near term, while
generating fiscal savings to buffer increases in debt service over the medium term.
•

Achieving a balanced budget in FY08/09 will require sustainable fiscal measures,
particularly by further improving tax administration and rationalizing capital spending.
It is important to maintain the momentum of tax revenue collection achieved so far, while
containing allocations of contingency funds and rationalizing capital spending priorities
to a level that is in line with Tonga’s implementation capacity and the availability of
nondebt generating financing.

8
•

A more orderly public wage adjustment process is also important to reduce fiscal
vulnerability. The wage bill remains large by regional standards. A sustainable wage
structure could include annual wage adjustment broadly in line with inflation, supported
by limited public hiring and a gradual decompression of the public wage structure to
retain high-skilled workers. Moreover, public wage adjustment will need to be formulated
within a medium-term fiscal framework to ensure fiscal sustainability (Box 1).

The Authorities’ Views
10.
The authorities are committed to a balanced budget, and there are contingency
funds to buffer potential shortfalls in tax revenue. They noted that, if necessary, additional
expenditure measures will be taken, mostly through prioritization of capital spending, to
ensure limited recourse to domestic financing. They have already revived a high level
Expenditure Review Committee to conduct quarterly budget reviews with the aim to
minimize possible fiscal slippages.
B. Moving Toward Monetary Tightening and Improved Exchange Rate Flexibility
Background
11.
Monetary policy was eased in several steps in early 2007 to support economic
recovery. At the time, inflation was less of a concern. The impact of monetary easing has
only started to materialize recently.
•

•

Private sector credit growth picked up
gradually. It reached 16½ percent (y/y)
at end-February 2008, from 6½ percent
at end-March 2007. Banks’ business
loans, however, grew at a faster pace
(to almost 30 percent by endDecember 2007), while growth in
housing loans has been relatively slow.

Excess liquidity climbed up to over
30 percent of reserve money in early 2008, but it has declined to around 10 percent in
recent months. This draw down was largely used to finance oil imports, with a
corresponding decline in NFA of the NRBT.

Box 1. Tonga: The Civil Service Wage Settlement
Substantial wage settlements over the
past few years have imposed significant
challenges to fiscal management.
Following a civil service strike that lasted
six weeks, the government and the Public
Service Association agreed in September
2005 on a large civil service wage increase
of 60–80 percent, with the wage increase
for FY05/06 to be paid in two phases
during FY05/06 and FY06/07. To partly
offset these large wage increases, the
government carried out a major voluntary
redundancy program in April–June 2006,
reducing personnel by 18 percent.

These developments had significant
fiscal implications. The total cost of the
wage settlement, including one-off
payments such as severance package,
accounts for about 9 percent of GDP in
FY05/06, and 3¾ percent in FY06/07.
Despite the substantial civil service
retrenchment in end-FY05/06, the wage
bill is still projected to increase to
13¾ percent of GDP in FY07/08 from its
pre-settlement level of 11¾ percent in
FY04/05.

Policy Issues and Staff Views
12.
Monetary easing in early 2007 was appropriate to revive the economy at a time
of low inflation, but a shift towards monetary tightening is warranted now with the
economy recovering and inflation rising.
•

Early monetary actions are needed to anchor inflationary expectations in advance of the
finalization of the FY08/09 budget. This is crucial to minimize wage pressures and to
prevent high inflation from becoming entrenched, as well as to help contain liquidity
pressure on the balance of payments.

•

Monetary tightening should be achieved through the use of effective, market-based
instruments, including the issuance of NRBT notes and increases in reserve requirements.
The reliance on administrative controls, such as credit ceilings, should be limited.

•

The NRBT could also step up prudential measures to help monitor the fast growth in
business loans. A continuation of this trend could pose risks to financial stability going
forward, especially in an environment of low growth that could undermine business and
households’ debt servicing capacity. The enactment of amendments to the NRBT Act,
approved by parliament in August 2007, will help further enhance the NRBT’s capital
base, strengthen its accountability in bank operations, and clarify its profit transfer rules.

The Authorities’ Views
13.
The authorities are committed to tighten monetary policy if necessary in order to
safeguard reserves and contain inflation, supported by a balanced budget.
•

Monetary actions are guided by two key considerations: maintaining reserves at a
minimum of three months of imports and keeping inflation under control. The authorities
acknowledged that inflation is already running at above their comfort zone of single digit
levels, and they are closely monitoring external developments, particularly oil payments
and remittances, as both items have significant but offsetting implications for reserves.

•

The NRBT concurred that relying on market-based instruments is desirable. They noted,
however, that the issuance of NRBT notes will only be efficient if there is excess liquidity
in the system. Achieving monetary tightening beyond that stage may require the use of
other instruments, including statutory reserve requirements and credit ceilings, to contain
credit growth. A continued reliance on NRBT notes at that stage may result in increased
costs for the NRBT, undermining its own financial soundness.

11
C. Improving External Viability
Background
14.
Staff analysis suggests that Tonga’s REER appears to be broadly in line with
economic fundamentals, although quantitative estimates point toward a likely
overvaluation that could be corrected within the adjustment band under the current
exchange rate regime. The results are subject to considerable uncertainty due to significant
data deficiencies.
•

Recent balance of payments dynamics appear sustainable, although trade performance
warrants close monitoring in light of a sustained rise in international fuel and food
prices. In the absence of further major external shocks, the current account deficit as a
share of GDP is expected to narrow significantly over the medium term as fuel and food
prices stabilize. Under this scenario, reserves should remain at around three months of
imports. The recent progress with banks to reduce the transaction costs for remittances
should support continued strong inflows, which will in turn help reduce external
vulnerability. However, the external vulnerability could be aggravated by further
increases in food and fuel prices.

•

Quantitative assessments of Tonga’s REER indicate a likely overvaluation of 5–
10 percent, which could be corrected within the monthly adjustment band under the
current exchange rate regime.2

•

The NRBT seems to have made little use of exchange rate flexibility since 2003, reflecting
concerns about the inflationary impact of further currency depreciation. The pa’anga
depreciated by 2¼ percent in nominal effective terms in 2007 against a weighted basket
of major currencies, while it appreciated by 5 percent vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. In real
effective terms, the pa’anga appreciated by 1¾ percent, reflecting mainly inflation rate
differentials with Tonga’s trading partners.

Policy Issues and Staff Views
15.
Following a depreciation of about 9 percent during 1997–2003, the REER
appreciated by 13 percent over 2003–07, reflecting mainly externally driven higher
inflation in Tonga relative to its trading partners.

2

Under a modified version of the Macroeconomic Balance (MB) approach, the REER overvaluation is
estimated at 3½ percent in 2006/07, whereas the equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) approach suggests an
overvaluation of about 10 percent. The external sustainability (ES) approach suggests that the REER would need
to depreciate by 8½ percent to stabilize the NFA of the banking system at its end-2006/07 level (17 percent of
GDP); economy-wide international investment position data are not available.

16.
External price competitiveness does not seem to be an immediate concern.
Tonga’s exports remain small (less than one-tenth of imports), and its major export product,
squash, is limited to a niche market in Japan where competitiveness is dominated by factors
such as local production patterns, quarantine standards, and other factors such as bilateral
preferential tariff treatment. Staff’s preliminary assessment indicates that the current weights
in the currency basket remain broadly in line with Tonga’s currency composition of trade,
provided that export revenues are augmented with remittance receipts, which may be viewed
as derived from service exports of human capital.
17.
Rebalancing the policy mix would support increased exchange rate flexibility to
safeguard reserves while keeping inflation expectations under control. This flexibility in
the near term would imply the need for a modest depreciation of the pa’anga in view of the
current level of reserves and strong import demand. This should help speed up balance of
payments adjustment and a reduction of pressures on reserves by lowering imports, which
would help create a virtuous cycle of policies that will reinforce each other to achieve the
authorities’ policy objectives. Increased exchange rate flexibility within the monthly
adjustment band would help correct a likely modest overvaluation of the pa’anga and ensure
external stability.
The Authorities’ Views
18.
The authorities agreed that recent balance of payments dynamics do not indicate
large exchange rate misalignment. While the current account deficit widened during the
last few years, this was mainly driven by negative terms-of-trade shocks, and remittance
inflows have continued to play a stabilizing role by supporting nearly 80 percent of imports.
The authorities expected that, in the event of a slowdown in remittances, imports would
decline accordingly. The authorities also emphasized that the current exchange rate regime
could provide sufficient flexibility to adjust a possible overvaluation, if needed.
19.
External price competitiveness was not a concern of major exporters. Despite the
fact that exports of squash have weakened in recent years, exchange rate competitiveness has

13
not been seen as a primary contributing factor, in part because squash production relies highly
on imported inputs, including fertilizer, while demanding quarantine standards, financing
difficulties, and supply side volatility overseas are more of a concern.
20.
The authorities noted that the magnitude of exchange rate depreciation will be
carefully considered given its inflationary impact. They nevertheless agreed that a prudent
fiscal stance and further monetary tightening should allow the NRBT to exercise increased
exchange rate flexibility to strengthen the policy framework under less favorable global
conditions.
D. Ensuring Debt Sustainability
Background
21.
The last Article IV consultation raised concerns about debt sustainability,
particularly relating to the size and timing of the China reconstruction loan. Agreement
with China’s EXIM Bank was signed in November 2007 for a RMB 440 million
reconstruction loan, currently valued at about US$63 million (23 percent of GDP), at
2 percent and 20-year maturity, with a grace period of five years, The initial plan was to
disburse the overall amount over a two-year period during 2008/09–2009/10 for the
reconstruction of Nuku’alofa. The actual disbursements, however, have been postponed as
the private sector has taken a significant lead in the reconstruction efforts. The government is
currently reassessing the funding requirement for future reconstruction, and is working on a
better-defined framework for the use of this loan.
Policy Issues and Staff Views
22.
Reconstruction will need to be implemented in line with the medium-term fiscal
framework to ensure debt sustainability. The Low Income Country Debt Sustainability
Assessment (LIC DSA, accompanying document) suggests that Tonga’s public and publicly
guaranteed external (PPG) debt is manageable in view of the positive debt dynamics over the
projection period. For illustrative purposes, the DSA assumes a utilization of US$10 million
of the reconstruction loan per year over FY08/09–FY12/13, with GDP growth rate at
historical average and fiscal consolidation. Reflecting Tonga’s low exports, however, NPV of
external debt and debt service-to-exports ratios are projected to exceed or be close to their
respective indicative thresholds of 100 percent and 15 percent, indicating a high risk of debt
distress. This risk is significantly mitigated by large remittance inflows. Indeed, remittances
have grown over time to reach seven times the value of exports in 2007, are the main sources
of foreign exchange earnings, and contribute significantly to revenue and national income.
23.
Limiting the use of nonconcessional financing to support future development
program is crucial. As the DSA illustrative scenario indicates that, if the reconstruction loan
mentioned above is disbursed in large sums over the next two years as initially planned, debt
service could jump to over 1 percent of GDP and 3 percent of projected reserves starting in
FY13/14 (after a five-year grace period), intensifying risks of external debt distress.

14
24.
A sound public debt management policy is needed to guide Tonga’s future
development financing and ensure debt sustainability over the medium term. Given the
current public debt dynamics, it is desirable for Tonga to rely as much as possible on donors’
grants to finance future development, supplemented by some use of long-term concessional
financing. Reliance on nonconcessional external borrowing is highly discouraged.
Development projects will need to be prioritized to be in line with the availability of donor
grants and concessional resources, as well as the country’s implementation capacity. The
private sector should be given a broader role in project implementation to improve efficiency.
Fiscal prudence, export diversification, and improved tourism, as well as policies to enhance
growth prospects are also critical underpinnings to debt sustainability over the medium term.
The Authorities’ Views
25.
The authorities broadly agreed with the general assessment of the DSA,
indicating that the overall size and business needs of the reconstruction loan are
currently being reviewed. This may lead to a significantly smaller disbursement over a
longer horizon than initially planned, along with a well-defined reconstruction program to be
financed by such credit. They also noted that donors are planning to step up grant financing
for Tonga over the next 2–3 years, but the capacity to fully utilize donor grants will need to
be significantly improved. Moreover, a strengthened policy framework and strong
remittances should help improve Tonga’s capacity in servicing its debt.
E. Structural Reform and Capacity Building
Background
26.
Corporatization and privatization of public enterprises has advanced, but
pressure on the government to take over a private power company, Shoreline, currently
owned by the King, has increased.3 The value of Shoreline was estimated by Deloitte and
Touche, an international accounting firm, at US$21 million in March 2007. Combined with
an additional US$5 million administrative fee, the total value of this transaction could cost
the government nearly 10 percent of GDP or 59 percent of reserves. The government is
considering using the foreign exchange proceeds from the sale of Westpac Bank of Tonga to
help finance this transaction, which could take place in the second half of FY07/08.
27.
Tonga’s governance indicators (World Bank, 2006) are perceived as weaker
than those of its regional peers. In particular, administrative impediments to business,
including restrictions on business licensing, land issues, and immigration visas, continue to
deter investors. However, these indicators may be outdated in view of recent developments in
this area. In particular, the Cabinet passed the Procurement Bill in late 2006, and final
3

There is a strong call from general public for the King to divest all his holdings in private companies prior to
his coronation in August 2008 to minimize the risk of conflict of interest.

15
preparations are underway to outsource certain government operations starting in FY08/09. In
addition, training courses have been provided on corporate governance and compliance, and
task forces have been created to review land, immigration visa, and business licensing issues.
The Independent Anti-Corruption Commission has also been granted legal enforcement
power to help enforce public governance.
Policy Issues and Staff Views
28.
Structural reform in Tonga should aim at raising efficiency, reducing quasifiscal risks, and improving governance. In this context, the proposal by the government to
retake the Shoreline is of concern, including to the donor community.
•

In particular, the estimated value of the company seems too large to be absorbed by the
fiscal accounts. The use of the foreign exchange proceeds from the sale of Westpac Bank
of Tonga for this transaction would undermine the objective of the NRBT to support
reserves under increased external pressure.

•

The government should make every effort to seek potential investors who may be
interested in acquiring Shoreline in the near future. Options to delay payments associated
with the underlying financial transaction until Shoreline is sold to private investors should
be considered as the best approach.

29.
Sound measures to address administrative impediments to investment and
increased transparency are two key pillars to improve public governance in Tonga. In
this context, implementation of the new Procurement Bill is a step in the right direction.
Outcomes of the task forces on governance should also be transformed to concrete,
monitorable measures. Moreover, improved public discussion of policies and timely
dissemination of information could help correct perceptions.
The Authorities’ Views
30.
Efforts will be made to ensure that the repurchase of Shoreline by the
government will be transparent, while options are being considered to minimize the
fiscal burden of this transaction. While noting the political sensitivity of this issue, the
authorities agreed that the search for potential investors should be given priority.
31.
There is a need to update the Governance Indicators for Tonga in view of the
latest developments. The government is ready to work closely with the donor community to
monitor the implementation of the Procurement Bill and further improve transparency.
STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
Tonga’s economy is recovering from the aftermath of the November 2006 riots.
However, adverse terms-of-trade shocks have contributed to inflation and balance of

16
payments pressures, and complicated economic management aiming at delivering low
inflation and stable growth while safeguarding external stability.
33.
As recognized by the authorities, it would be desirable to improve the
economy’s resilience to external shocks through rebalancing the policy mix. This would
require a policy shift toward a tighter monetary stance and a sound fiscal framework to
contain inflation, while facilitating greater exchange rate flexibility at a time of significant
external pressure.
34.
The authorities’ commitment to a tighter monetary policy stance is welcome,
but early actions are warranted to anchor inflationary expectations, particularly in
advance of the finalization of the FY08/09 budget. Monetary tightening should be
conducted through the use of effective, market-based instruments, and reliance on credit
ceilings should be limited. High credit growth to the business sector may also need to be
closely monitored to ensure financial stability. The extent of monetary tightening may need to
be reviewed on a timely basis to avoid inflation becoming entrenched.
35.
A balanced budget for FY08/09 is appropriate to share the burden of
macroeconomic management. Meeting this target requires sustained efforts to limit new
public hiring, contain nonwage spending, and improve tax administration. This is crucial to
address downside risks arising from new tax measures introduced in the past two years.
Further improvement in expenditure management is also essential, including a prioritization
of capital projects in line with the availability of donor grants and nonconcessional financing,
and Tonga’s implementation capacity. The authorities’ decision to utilize the Expenditure
Review Committee to conduct quarterly budget reviews is timely to help minimize risks of
fiscal slippage. Over the medium term, the fiscal framework should aim at small budget
surpluses to buffer future increases in debt service payments, underpinned by tax
administration reform and a more orderly public wage policy.
36.
The exchange rate appears to be broadly in line with economic fundamentals,
although quantitative estimates point toward a likely modest overvaluation which could
be corrected under the current exchange rate regime. Given the current level of reserves
and rising import demand, a modest depreciation of the pa’anga may be required in the near
term to speed up a real adjustment in the balance of payments, thereby containing pressures
on reserves. An improved policy mix would provide scope for a modest depreciation while
keeping inflation expectations under control.
37.
The authorities plan to retain the exchange restriction in the form of a tax
certification requirement applied to various current international transactions. The
Board approved this restriction until July 9, 2008 or the 2008 Article IV consultation,
whichever is earlier. In the absence of the firm timetable for the removal of this restriction,
staff does not propose further approval of this restriction.
38.
Tonga’s medium-term debt sustainability hinges on the strength of fiscal
consolidation and prospects for securing nondebt-creating flows. Tonga’s public debt
dynamics reveal that donor grants and long-term concessional loans are the preferred form of

17
financing. Recourse to nonconcessional borrowing should be avoided. The reconstruction
loan of US$63 million puts Tonga over the external debt distress thresholds over the medium
term, suggesting a high risk of distress. In this context, the authorities’ decision to review the
size of this loan is timely, and the amount of annual disbursement should be kept to levels
consistent with Tonga’s medium-term fiscal framework and implementation capacity.
Remittances play an important role in significantly mitigating external debt and debt service
risks. Nevertheless, a sound public debt management policy, together with export
diversification and increased tourism, will further enhance Tonga’s debt sustainability.
39.
The government’s plan to temporarily renationalize Shoreline should be
carefully reviewed and articulated to the public. Every effort should be made to seek
potential investors who may be interested in acquiring the company in the near future. In the
meantime, options to delay payments associated with the underlying financial transaction by
the government until Shoreline is sold to private investors should be considered.
40.
The authorities have made progress in the area of governance, including through
the approval by the Cabinet of a Procurement Bill to be implemented in FY08/09.
Further efforts are needed to address land, immigration visa, and business licensing issues,
which have deterred investment and given rise to public perceptions of weak governance.
Moreover, public discussion of policies and timely dissemination of information could help
improve transparency and help communicate the authorities’ policy intentions.
41.
Improving statistical capacity remains a priority, and further technical
assistance in this area is needed. The authorities have identified the national accounts and
price statistics as priorities in need of technical assistance, and they are encouraged to work
closely with PFTAC and AsDB to review the existing TA programs to help address these
issues.
42.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Tonga takes place on a
standard 12-month cycle.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND AND
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TONGA
Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis 20081
Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
The International Development Association
Approved by Jeremy V. Carter and Anthony Boote (IMF)
and Vikram Nehru and Carlos Primo Braga (IDA)
June 17, 2008
Under the baseline scenario, the NPV-of-debt to GDP as well as the NPV-of-debt to export
ratios remain above the country-specific indicative thresholds for a prolonged period.
Consequently, the Low Income Country Debt Sustainability Analysis (LIC DSA) indicates
that Tonga remains at a high risk of external debt distress. At the same time, Tonga benefits
from very high remittance inflows (over 30 percent of GDP), which are by far the largest
source of foreign exchange earnings and have a countervailing effect by helping to mitigate
liquidity risks. Moreover, Tonga’s overall public sector debt indicators, while elevated over
the short term, show a decreasing trend over the longer run. Taking into account the cushion
provided to the economy by the large workers remittances, the debt should remain
manageable.
The LIC DSA suggests limiting the utilization of the nonconcessional reconstruction loan
while lengthening its disbursement horizon, together with increases in donor grant and
concessional financing to support future developments, are crucial for further improving
Tonga’s public debt dynamics. Fiscal prudence and policies to enhance growth prospects are
also critical underpinnings to debt sustainability over the medium term.

This DSA was prepared jointly with the World Bank in accordance with the Debt Sustainability Framework for
low-income countries approved by the Executive Boards of the IMF and IDA. The debt data underlying this
exercise were provided by the Tongan authorities.

DMSDR1S-#3597178-v8-Tonga - 2008 Art IV - Staff Report - DSA Supplement.DOC July 29, 2008 (5:08 PM)

2
I. BACKGROUND
The external and public debt sustainability analyses are based on the standard LIC
DSA framework.2 The DSA presents the projected path of Tonga’s external and public
sector debt burden indicators, and draws some conclusions on the forward-looking
sustainability of debt.
Tonga’s total public sector debt stock (including publicly guaranteed debt) declined to
45¼ percent of GDP in FY06/07 from 48½ percent of GDP in FY05/06. External debt to
GDP fell as donor financing declined in real terms, while fiscal consolidation to limit domestic
budget financing also contributed to a downward trend in domestic public debt to GDP.
Following the civil unrest in November of 2006, the government made a significant
effort toward securing financing for the reconstruction of the capital city of Nuku’alofa.
This includes donor grants of about $15 million, to be channeled through designated banks to
business entities affected by the riots in the form of off-budget, low interest rate loans in the
second half of FY07/08. The government also signed a long-term reconstruction loan from
the EXIM Bank of China in November 2007. Disbursements of this loan have been
postponed, as the government is currently reassessing the overall financing requirement for
the reconstruction, with an aim to reduce the overall loan utilization and lengthening the
disbursement horizon.3
II. BASELINE
Tonga’s DSA builds on the baseline scenario assumptions presented in Box 1. It assumes
real GDP growth rate at its historical average, fiscal consolidation, a utilization of
$50 million of the reconstruction loan over FY08/09–FY12/13, with an even disbursement of
$10 million per year and repayments after a five-year grace period. The baseline assumes no
other major external nonconcessional borrowing. The authorities are currently reassessing the
overall financing requirement to be supported by the reconstruction loan, with an aim to
significantly reduce the overall size of loan utilization while lengthening the disbursement
horizon. Accordingly, the assumption on the reconstruction loan under the baseline is likely
to be an upper bound.

The 2008 DSA baseline shows an improved public debt and debt service profiles over the medium to long
term as compared with those presented in the 2007 DSA where the reconstruction loan was assumed to be
disbursed and utilized fully over a two-year period during FY08/09–09/10.

III. EXTERNAL DSA
External debt declined to 40½ percent of GDP in FY06/07, from 42½ percent of GDP in
FY05/06, over 80 percent of which is on concessional terms. Under the baseline scenario,
the NPV of PPG external debt is projected to increase by about 5 percent of GDP, to
38 percent of GDP by FY12/13, above its indicative threshold of 30 percent, but decline
subsequently to 16½ percent of GDP by FY27/28.4 The NPV of debt and debt service-torevenue ratios also remain well below their respective indicative thresholds of 200 percent
and 25 percent over the projection period (Table 1a).
Reflecting Tonga’s low exports, the NPV of PPG external debt-to-exports ratio is
projected to exceed the respective indicative threshold of 100 percent. However, this is
mitigated by the fact that large remittances, which are the largest source of foreign exchange
earnings (one half of Tongans live abroad, mostly in Australia, New Zealand, and the United
States) have a countervailing effect by helping to reduce liquidity risks.5 Efforts to improve
the policy framework, including fiscal consolidation, will also be critical to reduce risks of
external debt distress.

4

The average World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment for the period 2005–2007 classifies
Tonga as a poor performer. The corresponding debt distress thresholds are: NPV of debt-to-exports (100
percent), GDP (30 percent), and revenues (200 percent); and debt service in percent of exports (15 percent) and
revenues (25 percent).

5

The baseline scenario assumes that net private transfer receipts will climb to an average 45½ percent of GDP
over the projection period from a historical average of 33½ percent, mainly reflecting the recent increase in the
number of Tongan workers abroad as well as a reduction in transfer costs.

1/ Represents Low Income Country DSA indicative thresholds for Tonga that is classified
as a poor performer under the World Bank's Country Policy and Institutional assessment.

The alternative scenarios and bound tests indicate Tonga’s vulnerability of its external
debt position to negative shocks to remittances and exports (Table 1b, Figure 1). Stress
tests also underscore the importance of limiting the nonconcessional borrowing to reduce the
risk without undermining debt sustainability. Moreover, a return of key variables, including
GDP and export growth, to their historical averages, would imply a deterioration in all ratios.
IV. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Tonga’s public debt sustainability depends critically on fiscal prudence, the
government’s commitment to limit new public borrowing, and its adoption of a phased
approach to utilizing the reconstruction loan (Table 2a). Under the baseline scenario, total
NPV of public debt is projected to increase by 5 percent of GDP by 2012/13 (to 43 percent of
GDP), and gradually decline to about 18 percent of GDP over the longer term, benefiting in
part from a favorable fiscal policy stance under the baseline scenario. Domestic public debt is
also projected to narrow markedly under this scenario, in line with recent policy
commitments, to below 6 percent of GDP by 2012/13 and less than 1 percent of GDP by
2027/28.
Alternative scenarios and stress tests highlight the vulnerability of the total public debt
to growth shocks, which could lead to a sharp deterioration in the debt burden
indicators. Furthermore, if other debt-creating flows increase, or the primary fiscal deficit
returns to its historical average of 0.6 percent of GDP, the public debt dynamics would
become much less favorable. The size of the reconstruction loan also remains a key risk,
especially if it were to be fully disbursed in the next two years (FY08/09–09/10), as
originally planned.

5
V. STAFF ASSESSMENT
Tonga remains at a high risk of external debt distress. At the same time, Tonga benefits
from very high remittance inflows, which are the largest source of foreign exchange earnings
and have a countervailing effect by helping to mitigate liquidity risks. Moreover, Tonga’s
overall public sector debt dynamics, while elevated over the short term, shows a decreasing
trend over the longer run, suggesting that it should remain manageable.
Stress tests highlight key vulnerabilities to debt sustainability over the medium term,
including lower GDP growth, major external shocks, and borrowing on less
concessional terms. This underscores the importance of sound macroeconomic policies to
improve growth potential on a sustainable basis, export diversification, and continued efforts
in fiscal consolidation. Moreover, limited use of nonconcessional borrowing and increased
utilization of donor grants and concessional financing would substantially improve the public
debt dynamics and reduce the risk of external debt distress. A sound public debt policy, in
line with the medium-term fiscal framework, is also essential to guide future development
financing in Tonga. In this context, priorities should be given to projects which would help
generate high growth and employment to ensure debt service capacity in the future.

6
Box 1. Baseline Assumptions
Real GDP growth is projected to average 1¾ percent over the period 2007/08–2012/13. This
reflects a transitory growth stimulus spurred by reconstruction activity in the capital city over
the first two years, and a return to a historical average of 1½ percent thereafter. This
conservative long-run growth outlook reflects structural impediments which continue to
constrain Tonga’s growth potential.
Inflation, as measured by the GDP deflator, is projected to average at around 8 percent over
the projection period of 2007/08–2012/13, reflecting partial pass through of world food and
fuel price increases assumed by the WEO. In U.S. dollar terms, GDP deflator inflation is
projected to average around 4 percent over the same period, reflecting modest depreciation of
the pa’anga against the U.S. dollar.
The fiscal balance is projected to achieve a virtual balance during 2007/08–2008/09 and
small surpluses over 2009/10–2012/13, based on the authorities’ stated objectives to limit
domestic financing of the budget. In the long run, tax revenue is projected to stabilize near its
historical average of around 32 percent of GDP, while total expenditure to come slightly
below its historical average of 32 percent of GDP through a modest containment of the wage
bill in real terms. This implies a fiscal surplus of ¼ percent of GDP in the long run to build
fiscal savings.
The current account deficit is projected to narrow to about 7 percent of GDP over the
medium term and stabilize around that level thereafter (from 10 percent of GDP in 2007/08).
Export base is projected to remain narrow and relatively undiversified, while strong
remittance inflows are expected to continue. Growth of imports is projected to moderate
markedly as reconstruction-related imports subside and world food and fuel prices stabilize.
Meanwhile, the outlook for net foreign direct investment remains favorable, broadly in line
with the past five-year average of 5½ percent of GDP. Official foreign reserves are projected
to remain comfortable in terms of import cover.
Reconstruction financing under the baseline represents an illustrative scenario where a softloan of about $10 million per year would be disbursed over a five-year period during
2008/09–2012/13. The cumulative loan disbursement of about $50 million represents a
plausible upper bound on the utilization of the $63 million reconstruction loan over the next
five years. This loan has an interest rate of 2 percent and a maturity of 20 years, with a 5-year
grace period.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating
flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline, while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the
baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after
the shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

the U.S. dollar as the intervention currency. In July 2000, the Japanese yen was
added to the basket, and the monthly maximum adjustment limit was raised to
5 percent from 2 percent that had prevailed since March 1998, when the allowance
for adjustment was introduced. Tonga has accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3 and 4. Tonga presently imposes an exchange restriction subject to
approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a). This restriction consists of the tax
certification requirement imposed by the authorities on the making of payments and
transfers for certain current international transactions: (i) payments for oil imports;
(ii) airline ticket sales; (iii) payments for specified charges/fees/services;
(iv) insurance payments; (v) lease payments; (vi) payments for medical expenses
incurred by residents; (vii) transfers by nonresidents of profits and dividends abroad;
(viii) external loan payments; and (xi) maintenance payments including remittances
for family living expenses.

ANNEX II. TONGA: RELATIONS WITH THE
PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTRE1
(As of February 2008)
Assistance to Tonga since 2002 included 31 advisory missions, mostly on tax and customs
administration and banking. During 2000–06, Tonga has sent 54 officials to the Centre’s
regional seminars, workshops and training courses, and six attachments were organized.
Public Financial Management
Since 2003, PFTAC's missions have focused on complementing the considerable assistance
provided by other TA agencies, including through the introduction of a midyear economic
review and fiscal update, reconciliation of monetary and fiscal data, and changes in budget
documentation. For the 2003/04 and 2004/05 budgets, assistance was provided in presenting
the final aggregate budget figures on a GFSM2001 basis. In 2004, PFTAC arranged for a
Tongan official to participate on a delegation of Pacific Island officials to the Australian
Commonwealth Ministry of Finance. During 2005, the PFTAC PFM Advisor participated in
a joint donor/government Feasibility Study related to a proposed long-term Financial and
Economic Management Program (FEMP), as well as worked with the Ministry of Finance on
assessing the financial implications of the proposed civil service wage increase. Since then
assistance in the form of a peripatetic advisor has been provided in 2006, and again in 2007,
to assist in revenue estimation work. The PFM Advisor has also delivered lectures on PFM to
all CEOs, in late April 2007. A joint PFTAC mission on revenue estimation and Statistics is
to visit Tonga in mid-March 2008 to further assist in these areas.
Tax Administration and Policy
A tax reform package, including a new consumption tax, was designed by PFTAC in 2002.
Follow-up missions in 2003 and 2004 were designed to assist preparations for the
implementation of that package. At the end of January 2005, the Minister of Finance
announced a substantially altered plan to implement a consumption tax and some other
changes on April 1, 2005. PFTAC was not requested to assist in its implementation. The
Centre will, however, provide assistance in the redrafting of the Customs legislation. In
late 2005, NZAID offered additional assistance to PFTAC to fund three short expert visits to
Nuku’alofa to assist with revenue forecasting; the first of these missions took place in
February 2006.

The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) in Suva, Fiji is a regional technical assistance
institution operated by the IMF with financial support of the Asian Development Bank, Australia, Japan, Korea
and New Zealand. The Centre's aim is to build skills and institutional capacity for effective economic and
financial management that can be sustained at the national level. Member countries are: Cook Islands,
Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa,
Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.

4
Following the restructuring of the Public Service, PFTAC carried out a mission in
September 2006. The mission also coincided with the public consultation of a new income
tax and Customs bills, both based on self-assessment principles. The mission’s primary
recommendations related to the compliance management of large taxpayers, a post
implementation review of the Consumption tax, workforce management—including change
management and the managing of risk in the Customs. The mission identified a number of
areas where PFTAC could be of further assistance. No formal response has been received to
date which PFTAC recently followed up on. In that context, account does need to be taken of
the disruption in Nuku’alofa of the recent civil riots and the resulting change to the
governments priorities.
Banking Sector Regulation and Supervision
An assessment to determine compliance with the Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking
Supervision (BCP) was conducted in 2002. It identified some shortcomings in Tonga’s legal
framework and resulted in a review of the Financial Institutions Act (FIA). The enhanced
FIA was enacted in late 2004. A TA mission provided assistance with drafting regulations
and guidelines, and establishing procedures for their implementation in April 2005. Further
assistance in supervision was provided in late 2005 and again in February 2006, as the on-site
examination process has been regularized with PFTAC assistance. Amendments to the
NRBT Act, which will strengthen the central bank’s enforcement capacity, are still awaiting
Parliament’s enactment. PFTAC also arranged, through funding provided in late 2005 by
NZAID, for the renewal of the secondment of a central banking manager from the Reserve
Bank of Fiji to serve as the Deputy Governor of the National Reserve Bank of Tonga.
Economic and Financial Statistics
In 2002, two reviews were undertaken in accordance with the GDDS and the Data Quality
Assessment Framework; one on BOP statistics and the other on the wider statistical system.
Subsequent missions in 2004 finalized GDDS metadata, provided training in BOP concepts
and practices, developed a new BOP business survey, and reviewed national accounts data.
In September 2005 a partial update of the 2002 statistical system review was done, focused
on outputs of the Statistics Division of the Ministry of Finance. Further assistance was
provided to peer review GDP and BOP estimates prior to publication. GDDS metadata was
approved and published in 2006 on the Data Dissemination Bulletin Board. A TA mission in
April 2007 provided further assistance with reviewing BOP statistics. In addition to the joint
PFTAC mission on revenue estimation and statistics in mid-March 2008, a further TA
mission is planned for early June 2008 to assist the Statistics Division with GDP and BOP
estimates.

ANNEX III. TONGA: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP2
(As of May 2008)

Since becoming a World Bank Group member in 1985, Tonga has received a total of five IDA
credits totaling SDR 15.2million (original amount USD equivalent of 22.8 million). Tonga is
eligible for an IDA 14 allocation of SDR 4.2 million (indicative only) over FY2006–08. The key
components of the Bank’s current program in Tonga are:
•

Health: The Tonga Health Sector Support Project (USD10.9 million credit approved in mid2003) aims to support the Government in improving the performance of its health sector
through appropriate health financing policy, revised health information systems, and
improved management and infrastructure of the country's main hospital. Construction of the
hospital, which is the major component of the project, has been satisfactorily completed.
Health financing policy has been developed and mechanisms of implementation are being
finalized.

•

Natural Hazard Management: The Cyclone Emergency Recovery and Management
Project, with an IDA credit of US$5.9 million approved in 2002, is assisting Tonga in
replacing and strengthening the resilience of social infrastructure and helping upgrade
Tonga’s emergency and risk management capacity to ensure it can cope better with future
disasters and the risk posed by climate change.

•

Education System: The Tongan Education Support Project with an IDA credit of
US$1.0 million and an NZAID trust fund of US$4.1 million (managed by the Bank) was
approved in June 2005. The project’s school grants fund (1) has been successfully
implemented in its first phase with nearly all schools having received grants on a capitation
basis and spent over 80% of the funds on educational materials and maintenance, and (2) has
been successfully evaluated, and lessons learned will be addressed in the second phase. At
the request of the Government of Tonga, the IDA Credit Agreement was amended in
January 2008 to allocate IDA funding to the third phase of the school grants program
in 2009.

•

Financial Management and Procurement: An IDF grant of US$200,000 was approved in
December 2003 to support public procurement reforms and procurement capacity building
through the provision of technical assistance. The draft Procurement Law, prepared by the
government-appointed consultant and based on the UNCITRAL Model Law, has been
reviewed by the Bank and comments were provided to the Government. It is being revised by
the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and Crown Law. Implementation for activities 2 and 3
(manual, standard bidding documents and training) is under way as MOF has just appointed
an individual consultant to provide assistance in the area.

2

Prepared by World Bank staff.

6
•

Transport Sector Reform: The Bank has completed a Transport Sector Review Study that
provides analytical assistance to support the Government’s commitment to improve the
structure and efficiency of the sector, including assessing options for sustainable financing. A
study of opportunities for public-private partnership in the airport sector was completed in
April 2006, leading to the corporatization of the airport on a business basis. The Bank is
preparing a lending program to help the Ministry of Transport to consolidate its recent laws
and realign its functions, as well as to improve inter-island ferry services (the project is
scheduled to go to the board on June 26, 2008). There is a tentative follow up Tonga
Transport project for FY11 which will draw upon the findings of a planned study on
infrastructure needs (supported by the new Pacific Regional Infrastructure Facility).

•

Private Sector Development: The World Bank Group has an active BEE program through the
trilaterally funded (IFC, FIAS, World Bank) Tonga Implementation of Regulatory Reform
Program (US$700,000 over two years). A draft MoU for a new BEE project is currently with
the Ministry of Finance for review. This project will build upon work carried out under the
previous Tonga Regulatory Reform Phase II. Under that project a Taskforce for the
Implementation of Regulatory Reform was established in January 2006, overseeing four
public-private Working Groups: Starting a Business; Licenses and Permits; Fishing (tax
focus); and Immigration. The membership of the Taskforce comprises four Ministers and
four senior private sector representatives, and its mandate is to identify and remove
regulatory impediments to private sector growth.

ANNEX IV. TONGA: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK3
(As of February 2008)
The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) strategy for Tonga supports the Government’s Strategic
Development Plan Eight 2006/07–2008/09 (SDP-8) development goals aimed at creating a
society in which all Tongans enjoy higher living standards and a better quality of life. The
government’s strategic objectives emphasize the need to have an average budget deficit less
than 2 percent of GDP, inflation below 7 percent, GDP growth in the 3–4 percent range and a
reduction in the poverty headcount index below 23 percent, through a dynamic and highly
competitive economy driven mainly by the private sector and an efficient public sector.
As agreed with the government, the new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2007–2012 for
Tonga will support the SDP-8 implementation in alignment with the objectives of the 2005
Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. The CPS will focus on poverty reduction by means
of three intervention pillars—pro-poor, environmentally sustainable integrated urban
infrastructure development; financing of pro-poor policies through effective, prudent
macroeconomic and fiscal management; and private sector development—that address
binding constraints on growth. Capacity strengthening and institution building will be among
the key outcomes of the results-based CPS. The CPS outcomes expected are (i) improved
fiscal governance, (ii) improved social services delivery in urban areas, and (iii) an improved
private sector-enabling environment.
AsDB has approved 15 loans totaling $57.8 million from the Asian Development Fund
(ADF) to Tonga since it joined AsDB in 1972. Fifty-four technical assistance projects with a
value of $15.3 million were also provided to improve capacity and strengthen institutional
development in various sectors. Past AsDB investments have focused on finance
development and infrastructure development in transport, power, agriculture, and fisheries.
Active projects include five TAs in the country portfolio. The latest loan on Economic and
Public Sector Reform was completed successfully in 2004. The five ongoing TAs focus on
public enterprise reforms, youth micro-enterprise development, preparing the integrated
urban development projects, support for the implementation of SDP-8, and Rationalization of
Public Enterprises, Phase III. Another TA on strengthening pro-poor policy in the Pacific for
Tonga for $0.2m has been implemented on a regional basis to support economic sector work
and some work is being prepared to complete that work. It is counted as country TA.

ANNEX V. TONGA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
While economic statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance, data deficiencies continue to
complicate the monitoring of economic conditions and policy formulation. The Statistics
Department (SD) and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) have received, on a regular basis,
technical assistance in national accounts, government finance, and balance of payments
(BOP) statistics from STA as well as the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre
(PFTAC); nevertheless, data provision to the Fund continues with long delays.
The two main sources of statistical information are the Quarterly Bulletin of the National
Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT), and the annual and semi-annual budget reports from the
MOF. The country has been participating in the GDDS since May 30, 2006. The metadata
are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(http://dsbb.imf.org/Applications/web/gdds/gddscountrycategorylist/?strcode=TON ).
Real Sector Statistics
The national account estimates are based primarily on the production approach; only rough
estimates of expenditure components are available. The SD has completed the revision of the
national accounts (base period 2000/01), based on the results of a new business establishment
survey, and with technical assistance from the Secretariat for the Pacific Community.
However, the response rates are very poor and there are major delays in data processing due
to staff capacity and shortages. In August 2004, a PFTAC mission proposed improvements to
source data and methodologies and suggested revisions of recent GDP estimates. A follow up
mission took place in March 2008 with a focus on balance of payments and national accounts
estimates and building linkages between government finance and national accounts statistics.
The mission found only a few of the GDP components were compiled to a reasonable
standard and were based on actual data (e.g. electricity and water supply). The mission raised
concerns about the widespread use in compilation of out-of-date fixed ratios, extrapolations
not founded on good data, and inappropriate price deflators.
The Consumer Price Index is based on a basket of goods and services from the 2000/01
Household Income and Expenditure Survey. Technical assistance is being provided in 2008
on the development of an import price index.
Labor market statistics are weak: employment statistics have not been compiled since 2003;
and average earnings statistics are not available.
Government Finance Statistics
The FY 2002/03 Budget Statement introduced a presentation of fiscal data compiled
according to the methodology of the 2001 Government Finance Statistics Manual. However,
improvements are still needed to ensure accurate and reliable fiscal data. Proper classification
of transactions is needed to permit reconciliation with monetary financing data. Lags in
updating the accounting system should be shortened. Published data are often subject to
significant revisions. No data are reported for publication in the IFS or GFS Yearbook.

9
External Sector Statistics
Official BOP statistics are compiled annually by the SD with long lags. Monthly trade
figures, derived from customs data, are available with a three-month lag. Unofficially, the
NRBT compiles monthly balance of payments statistics based on the Overseas Exchange
Transactions records of the banking system with a six-week lag. There are significant
differences between the BOP estimates compiled by the two agencies. Moreover, large errors
and omissions point to possible under recording of imports. Work is needed to reconcile the
data on stocks of reserve assets that are available from various data sources. The MOF has
put in place a system that provides detailed information on official sector external
disbursements and debt service.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
Until recently, the reporting of monetary and financial statistics (MFS) to the Fund for
publication in International Financial Statistics (IFS) was irregular. This was particularly
worrisome since these data are shared with APD through an integrated monetary database.
This situation has improved, as the NRBT now reports data for the central bank, other
depository corporations, and monetary aggregates using the standardized report forms
(SRFs). These data were published for the first time in the March 2008 issue of IFS and IFS
Supplement on Monetary and Financial Statistics. The NRBT will have to allocate resources
to improve the quality of MFS by obtaining source data suitable for compilation of the SRFs
in line with the recommendations of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 31, 2008

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with Tonga
On July 2, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Tonga. 1
Background
Tonga’s economy has shown resilience in the aftermath of the November 2006 riots and is now
on a path to recovery. The key factor underpinning this resilience has been private investment.
Donor-supported government reconstruction loans are expected to add further momentum to
the recovery. However, the global upswing in fuel and food prices has intensified pressure on
inflation and external reserves, the latter mitigated to a large extent by strong inflows of
remittances.
Real GDP contracted by about 3¼ percent in FY06/07 (ending June), following the
November 2006 riots, but the private sector quickly relocated businesses and replenished lost
inventories. Preliminary indicators for the first half of FY07/08 suggest that the economy is on a
path to recovery led by the services sector.
Adverse terms of trade shocks contributed to inflation pressures. Major increases in external
food and fuel prices, combined with a nominal depreciation of the pa’anga against the
currencies of major trading partners, have led to a marked increase in CPI inflation, which
reached 12½ percent at end-March 2008 (from 6¾ percent at end- December 2007).
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2

Tonga’s external position is expected to weaken, reflecting mainly the impact of rising food and
fuel prices. The current account deficit is projected to remain high in FY07/08 at about
10 percent of GDP, as sharp increases in imports, reflecting the economy’s heavy reliance on
oil imports, are matched by increases in remittances. External reserves have declined
somewhat since last June, but are expected to stabilize at around 3-months of imports at endFY07/08 on account of the projected improvements in official and private capital inflows.
Significant efforts have been made to achieve a balanced budget in FY07/08. During the first
nine months of FY07/08, revenue performance remained buoyant, boosted by a recovery of
arrears and a containment of the public wage bill and nonwage spending. The authorities have
proposed a balanced budget in FY08/09 to limit domestic and nonconcessional external
borrowing. The budget proposes over 20 percent growth in tax revenue to support higher
maintenance and capital spending. At the same time, the budget also propose a reduction of
maximum tariff rates and increase in the individual income tax exemption threshold, together
with a reduction in the corporate tax rate for large taxpayers.
Monetary policy was eased in several steps in early 2007 to support economic recovery. At the
time, inflation was less of a concern. The impact of monetary easing has only started to
materialize recently. Private sector credit growth picked up gradually. It reached 16½ percent
(y/y) at end-February 2008, from 6½ percent at end-March 2007. Banks’ business loans,
however, grew at a faster pace (to almost 30 percent by end-December 2007), while growth in
housing loans has been relatively slow.
Tonga’s total public debt stock declined to 45¼ percent of GDP in FY06/07 from 48½ percent of
GDP in FY05/06. External debt to GDP fell as donor financing declined in real terms, while fiscal
consolidation to limit domestic budget financing also contributed to a downward trend in
domestic public debt to GDP. Following the civil unrest in November of 2006, the government
made a significant effort toward securing financing for the reconstruction of the capital city of
Nuku’alofa; the government contracted a long–term soft loan of about US$63 million (or
23 percent of GDP in FY07/08), but disbursements of this loan have been postponed.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the resilience of the Tongan economy in the aftermath of the
November 2006 riots. With political stability now restored, private investment is picking up and
near-term growth prospects have become more favorable, especially in the tourism and
construction sectors. Directors considered that attention should now turn to rebalancing the
economic policy mix, in order to address the inflationary risks and external vulnerabilities arising
from increases in world food and fuel prices.
Directors commended the authorities for the progress they have made in ensuring fiscal
prudence, including the recovery of tax arrears and the containment of the public wage bill and
nonwage spending. They welcomed the planned balanced budget in FY07/08, which is
evidence of strengthened fiscal discipline, and considered it to be essential to maintain a

3
tightened fiscal stance in FY08/09 in order to help fight inflation. Directors called for a more
orderly public sector wage policy to reduce fiscal vulnerability.
Directors recommended an early monetary tightening to support fiscal policy in the effort to
contain inflation and anchor inflation expectations. This should be achieved through the
increased use of market-based instruments, including the issuance of reserve bank notes.
Directors encouraged the authorities to step up prudential measures to help monitor the fast
growth in business loans.
Directors agreed that Tonga’s current balance of payments position appears broadly
sustainable, and considered that external price competitiveness has been generally preserved.
However, in light of the sustained rise in international fuel and food prices, they recommended
monitoring trade performance closely. Directors took note of the staff assessment that the real
effective exchange rate of the Tongan pa’anga is close to its equilibrium level. At the same time,
they observed that allowing some greater exchange rate flexibility, underpinned by appropriately
tight fiscal and monetary policies, would help ensure external stability and safeguard external
reserves, although it was recognized that the potential inflationary impact of such a move would
need to be monitored carefully.
Directors stressed the importance of assessing the debt sustainability implications of the
reconstruction loan contracted with a major donor. They cautioned that the loan, as currently
structured, could increase Tonga’s risk of debt distress, although the large remittance inflows
could help mitigate this risk. Directors therefore welcomed the authorities’ decision to review the
size of the loan to ensure that it is consistent with Tonga’s medium-term fiscal framework, its
implementation capacity, and real sector business needs, and to best utilize this loan over a
suitable longer time horizon. They called on the authorities to strengthen their public debt
management policy and limit the recourse to non-concessional borrowing to ensure debt
sustainability over the medium term.
Directors commended the authorities for the progress made in the corporatization and
privatization of public enterprises, as well as the measures to improve governance. The
Procurement Bill has been implemented, which will make government contracting more
transparent, and a task force has been set up to review administrative impediments to business.
Directors recommended revisiting plans for the government to purchase the electricity company,
bearing in mind the financial burden and the quasi-fiscal and governance risks of such a step. A
better alternative would be to seek private investors to acquire the company.
Directors encouraged the authorities to work closely with technical assistance providers to
improve further Tonga’s statistical capacity, particularly in the areas of national accounts and
price statistics.
