STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 16, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context and Outlook. The economy has entered a broadly favorable trajectory of
healthy and balanced growth, thanks to a multi-year reform effort. Output should
surpass its pre-crisis peak of 2008 for the first time this year, but now in a sustainable
manner. Downside risks dominate however, reflecting primarily external factors. The
income gap with Western Europe remains considerable, underscoring the need for
continued policy discipline and reform. The momentum will need to come increasingly
from structural changes as dividends from macroeconomic adjustment run their course.
Analysis of key structural issues in this report draws on the companion Baltic Cluster
Report.
Euro Adoption. Lithuania is well placed to adopt the euro next year, in terms of entry
criteria, sustainability of low inflation and public finances, and external stability. It will be
a welcome boon to the economy, enhancing financial stability and bringing integration
gains. But upgrading supporting policy frameworks, especially to better control the
business cycle, will be imperative for EMU membership to be a lasting success.
Fiscal Policy. The repair of public finances is well advanced but not yet complete. More
consolidation is needed to reach the medium-term objective and materially bring down
the debt ratio after its relentless post-crisis increase. It should come from high-quality
revenue measures; a public expenditure review would help ensure spending efficiency
within an overall tight envelope.
Financial Stability. Financial stability has improved further and the main challenge now
is resuscitating private sector credit growth to support investment.
Structural Reforms. Tackling high structural unemployment, securing a vibrant export
sector for the future, and pushing ahead with key infrastructure projects in energy and
transport are important priorities.

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA

CONTEXT
1.
The authorities remain on track with public finance repair and meeting conditions for
euro adoption. Scope for bold reforms is limited in the four-party coalition led by the Social
Democrats since late 2012, but two key projects are advancing well: (i) Prime Minister Butkevicius
has staked his political survival on successfully adopting the euro next year, with the Lithuanian
economy now well placed to do so, and (ii) fiscal consolidation is moving further ahead, with the
public debt ratio now on the verge of starting to decline. Presidential and European elections are
due in May. Incumbent President Grybauskaite is running as an independent and is leading opinion
polls by a large margin.
2.
The economy has entered a broadly favorable trajectory of healthy and balanced
growth—output is set to surpass its 2008 peak for the first time this year. Determined reform
efforts since the 2008/09 crisis have produced strong economic growth of more than 3 percent in
each of the past three years. Similar prospects for 2014 will put real GDP above 2008 levels, but this
time the current account is in slight surplus, inflationary pressures are absent, and the banking
system’s loan-to-deposit ratio is contained at not much above 100 percent.
3.
Nonetheless, income convergence with Western Europe has a long way to go,
underscoring the need for continued reforms, policy discipline, and consistently high
investment. Despite strong progress since the
mid-1990s, Lithuania’s per capita GDP has
advanced to only one-third of Western Europe’s
and, at 11.4 percent, unemployment is too high.
With demographic headwinds building and
dividends from macroeconomic adjustment
running their course, the onus for driving future
income convergence will increasingly shift
toward structural reforms.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Growth in 2013 remained solid, despite a difficult external environment. Largely driven
by domestic demand, real GDP expanded by 3.3 percent, as rising real wages boosted private
consumption and investment rebounded on the back of high capacity utilization, more public
investment, and a recovery in construction. Export growth slowed in the second half of the year,
reflecting a softening of trading partner demand and weaker agricultural export growth following
the 2012 bumper harvest. Unemployment continued to fall, including for youth and the longer-term
unemployed.
5.
Global price developments further reduced inflation. Average inflation continued to
moderate from 3.2 percent in 2012 to 1.2 percent in 2013, reflecting falling energy prices, food price

disinflation, and global price trends. Average core inflation ran at a moderate 1.4 percent last year,
despite a pickup of wage growth, partly reflecting the sizable one-off minimum wage increases in
July 2012 and January 2013 for a cumulative 25 percent.

External stability is in place, with the exchange rate broadly aligned with fundamentals,
manageable external debt and international investment positions, and the current account in
moderate surplus (Box 1). Despite slowing exports, Lithuania continued to gain world market share
and the current account balance improved in 2013 on account of a pickup of current transfers from
the EU. Lithuania has among the best absorption rates of EU funds, with 99 percent of funds from
the 2007–13 framework contracted and 75 percent paid as of end-2013. Lithuania’s international
reserve coverage appears relatively low at some 70 percent of the Fund’s reserve metric, but much
of the external debt reflects inter-company loans and euro adoption would remove any remaining
vulnerability.

The current account is broadly balanced. Adjustment from the large deficits of the 2003–08 boom period
was primarily driven by a surge in exports, rather than a compression of imports, thus suggesting that the
adjustment effort is sustainable. Staff projects the current account to swing into a deficit on the order of
1½–2 percent of GDP over the medium term as income levels converge with Western Europe. It would be
more than fully covered by FDI.
Gross external debt has come down significantly in
recent years and now stands at 65 percent of GDP.
Standardized tests suggest that it would remain
sustainable under a variety of adverse shocks (Figure 1A).
Private external debt relative to GDP and gross external
debt relative to exports remain below the customary
vulnerability thresholds. Moreover, a significant share of
external debt is owed to foreign parent companies and
foreign banks and should therefore not be subject to
disruptive withdrawal.

The international investment position stands at negative 46 percent of GDP. The excess of inward over
outward foreign direct investment together with net parent bank funding for Lithuanian subsidiaries fully
explain this liability position.
International reserves stood at a relatively low €6 billion at end-2013, compared to an adequacy metric
of €8.9 billion. Elevated short-term foreign debt is partly responsible, although much of it is owed to parent
banks and companies. Nonetheless, reserves are also on the low side when related to GDP (17 percent) or
months of imports (2½ months). But this will no longer be a source of vulnerability when Lithuania adopts
the euro.

7.
The repair of public finances continues to advance, but court rulings to correct some
of the crisis-related expenditure cuts have yet to be implemented.


The 2013 fiscal deficit likely overperformed its 2½ percent of GDP target. Tight expenditure
allocations and control, as well as efforts to improve upon the sluggish tax collection in the first
part of the year, reduced the deficit to an estimated 2.1 percent of GDP, following the
abrogation of the EC’s Excessive Deficit Procedure last June based on the 3.2-percent-of-GDP
deficit in 2012.



The 2014 budget targets a deficit of 1.9 percent of GDP for the general government.
Forgoing generalized pension and wage increases drives the further consolidation. In a

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA

loosening relative to recent years, other expenditure is allowed to grow roughly in line with
nominal GDP. No significant tax policy changes are envisaged.


Recent Constitutional Court rulings mandate the restoration and compensation for wage
and pension cuts to the extent that they were disproportionate across pensioners and
government employees, respectively (Box 2). Pension and wage restoration has already taken
place and is reflected in the 2014 budget law. But compensation for wage and pension losses in
the crisis years costing between 0.8 and 1.5 percent of GDP is not, pending decisions on the
modalities and phasing of compensation payments.
Box 2. Constitutional Court Ruling on Pension and Wage Cuts
Background. In the wake of the 2008/09 crisis, wages for government employees and pensions were cut as
part of the necessary fiscal consolidation effort. Cuts were larger and hence disproportionate for higherwage and higher-pension earners.
Decisions. In two separate rulings, the Constitutional Court established that this disproportionality was
unconstitutional. It mandates disproportionate cuts to be reversed and foregone income to be
compensated. The rulings do not precisely pin down the modalities and timing of corrective actions.

Next steps. Pension and wage restoration has already taken place. Compensation schemes remain under
discussion, with decisions likely to be taken in a staggered manner and payments phased over several years.
Once compensation payments have been approved by Parliament, their full amount will immediately be
recognized as public expenditure, thereby increasing the accrual fiscal deficit as calculated by Eurostat. But
as a one-off expenditure, it would not affect the structural fiscal balance. It may also be excluded or
discounted when assessing compliance with SGP deficit limits.

8.
The financial system is stable, but credit growth remains sluggish. Over 90 percent of
the system is owned by Nordic cross-border banking groups. Capital adequacy rose further to a
comfortable 17½ percent at end-2013 and liquidity indicators are well ahead of regulatory minima.
While some smaller banks would benefit from bigger capital buffers—especially as the regulatory
bar will rise with the implementation of global and European reforms—and credit unions are in need
of reform, they do not pose material risk to overall financial stability because of their small size.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA

Despite good progress in reducing non-performing loans, private sector credit has yet to return
decisively to positive growth, likely reflecting engrained post-crisis risk aversion on the part of both
potential borrowers and banks, as well as debt overhang in many households.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
9.
Growth is expected to pick-up from 3.3 percent this year to 3¾ percent in the medium
term and to remain balanced. Momentum in domestic demand will likely extend into 2014 (and is
already evident in readings of high frequency indicators early in the year). High capacity utilization,
territorial planning reform, and efforts to avoid a dip in the availability of EU funds in the transition
to the new 7-year financial perspective should underpin strong investment and a continued recovery
in the still low investment-to-GDP ratio. The rise of real wages in line with productivity should
support robust private consumption. Externally, improving prospects for western export markets are
likely to be offset by the clouded outlook for Russia and other CIS countries. With the output gap
expected to close in 2014, future growth will mirror potential growth, which is projected to rise to
some 3¾ percent over time.1 Income convergence is likely to move the current account into a small
deficit position and entail a slight pickup of inflation from its current historical lows.
10.
Risks around this outlook remain tilted to the downside, primarily due to external
factors. As a small, open economy with strong trade and financial linkages, Lithuania is susceptible
to spillovers from abroad, although the balanced external position and the absence of domestic
overheating provide a degree of protection. A protracted period of low growth in advanced and
emerging economies would weigh on exports, which account for some 80 percent of GDP.

than staff and the Ministry of Finance puts medium-term growth some ½ percent higher. They saw
slower trading partner growth as the most important downside risk, but noted that exports were
well diversified and that Russia was important primarily for Lithuanian transport companies rather
than domestic manufacturers. They downplayed risks from tighter global financing conditions,
considering limited external financing needs and little remaining reliance on parent bank funding,
but noted susceptibility of parent banks to housing market developments in the Nordics. They
agreed that sustained lack of credit growth could eventually undermine investment. Efficient use of
EU funds was equally important to further investment for income convergence.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
12.
Discussions focused on policies to further advance income convergence with Western
Europe: the planned euro adoption would spur economic integration and entail a strengthening of
policy frameworks; fiscal policy could pay dividends from raising the quality of public spending and
continuing with its disciplined approach; with financial stability in place, the focus is shifting to
ensuring sufficient credit to fund productive investment; and structural reforms would help raise
economic efficiency. The authorities are open to the Fund’s policy advice and have implemented
many past recommendations (Box 3).
Box 3. Implementation of Past Fund Advice
Fiscal Policy. The authorities have been pushing ahead with the recommended fiscal consolidation and
appear to have met the euro entry criterion on the fiscal deficit with a good safety margin. However,
consolidation remains biased to the expenditure side. Suggestions to consider higher recurrent taxation of
wealth and property remain under discussion.
Financial Sector Policy. The Fund’s past advice has focused on addressing weaknesses in the domestic
banking system. The authorities have meanwhile intervened and closed the two largest domestic banks,
thereby removing risks to financial stability. Attention has now turned to issues in the small credit union
sector. MCM has provided technical assistance for reform.
Structural Policy. The authorities share the Fund’s view that price competitiveness gains from post-crisis
adjustment need to be preserved. They have taken steps to further improve the business climate, including
through simplification of territorial planning rules. Migration policies to help address challenges from
demographic aging are under consideration. There has also been some progress with improving frameworks
to work out debt.

Lithuania appears on track to meet the
entry criteria for euro adoption. The fiscal deficit
and public debt are well below Maastricht
thresholds; the exchange rate has long been fixed
under the currency board arrangement, and
inflation and interest rates run at less than the
reference values—the average of the three “bestperforming” EU economies plus a margin of 1.5
and 2 percentage points, respectively. Prospects
for sustaining good fiscal performance and low
inflation in the longer run are favorable, provided
policies remain supportive (Boxes 4 and 5).

ECB, to be published in June.
14.
After two decades of a currency board arrangement, the economy is well prepared for
EMU, but supporting policy frameworks would benefit from further strengthening. Lithuania
has demonstrated economic flexibility and political grit to deal with shocks and deliver adjustment—
most recently in the wake of the 2008/09 crisis, but also during the Russia crisis of 1998 and
following 2002 when the currency board was re-pegged from a weak U.S. dollar to a strengthening
euro. But controlling the business and financial cycles has proved more challenging, as evidenced by
the large boom-bust cycle during 2003–10. It will therefore be essential to preserve and build upon
economic flexibility while strengthening countercyclical policy frameworks to make EMU
membership a lasting success.


The fiscal framework will be strengthened by the Fiscal Compact, but it should be
supplemented by a countercyclical fiscal rule to ensure that fiscal buffers are built in good times,
to provide the space needed for economic stabilizers to operate freely in downturns. Integration
with the compact’s correction mechanism is important to avoid potential inconsistencies and
fragmentation in public financial management. The planned establishment of a fiscal council in
the National Audit Office should be expedited to allow sufficient time to build expertise.



The financial framework will benefit from establishing macro-prudential powers for the Bank of
Lithuania, with related legislation currently before Parliament. This will allow leaning against the
wind when financial cycles cannot be addressed adequately by common monetary policy. Close
cooperation of home and host country authorities of cross-border banks remains important—
the Nordic-Baltic cooperation forums are valuable platforms that should be preserved, built
upon, and adapted to the emerging European banking union.



There have been tangible reforms to the restructuring and insolvency frameworks and more
are in the pipeline. This will not only facilitate dealing with existing debt overhangs, but can also
help guard against debt-deflation problems in future, potentially arising from asymmetric
shocks inside the currency union. Court rulings have established precedents that clarify
implementation and application of the law and this has helped speed up resolution of nonperforming loans. Speedier and more widespread use of the household insolvency law that
came into effect in early 2013 would be desirable.3 Recent changes to the corporate insolvency
framework are helpful but the limited effectiveness of the framework for going-concern
restructurings is yet to be tackled.



Labor market flexibility should be safeguarded and built upon. Large flows in and out of
unemployment and high cross-border mobility attest to a flexible labor market, with moderate
unemployment benefits and contained minimum wages. Yet, skill mismatches in the labor

market, overly restrictive provisions in the labor code, and a high tax wedge make for high
structural unemployment (see below).
15.
Euro adoption would be a welcome boon for the economy. While not a sea change from
the euro-based currency board, it will shift several factors in Lithuania’s favor: a relatively low reserve
cover will be replaced by access to ECB liquidity, thereby enhancing financial stability and putting
downward pressure on risk premiums; and, if accompanied by the right policies, even closer
integration with the euro area could help foster trade, involvement in global value chains, and
foreign direct investment—a welcome impetus given the importance to secure a vibrant export
sector for future (see below and Baltic Cluster Report).
16.
The authorities feel ready for euro adoption and are firmly committed to the project.
They recognize that there is no room for complacency once inside EMU and saw no tangible risk of
undue relaxation of policies—this has not been Lithuania’s track record. The European framework
imposes many checks and balances, wage formation is market driven, and external price
competitiveness is high. The Bank of Lithuania underscored the importance of the forthcoming
macroprudencial policy tools. Their effectiveness would further strengthen with improved homehost cooperation under the European banking union. But successful macroeconomic management
requires support from fiscal policy. The Ministry of Finance is committed to complete full alignment
of the fiscal framework with all EU and euro area requirements in the near future, although work on
an explicit countercyclical fiscal rule seems to be left for later.

Lithuania’s inflation track record is reassuring. It has
maintained comparatively low inflation since 1999 with an
annual average inflation differential to the euro area (EA)
of just 0.8 percentage points—one-third that of Latvia and
less than half that of Estonia. Since mid-2013, inflation has
converged to euro area levels and the differential turned
negative in mid-2013. However, inflation has been much
more volatile than in the EA, primarily reflecting the
pronounced boom-bust cycle of the Baltic economies
during 2003–10. With negative output gaps now closing, a
harder test for containing inflation lies ahead.

Source: Eurostat.

Income convergence implies somewhat higher inflation in Lithuania than in the EA. Catching-up
economies are characterized by higher productivity growth in the tradable sector but not necessarily in the
nontradable sector than richer economies. International price equalization for tradable goods and wage
equalization within countries across tradable and nontradable sectors then imply a positive inflation
differential in catching-up countries—the so-called Balassa-Samuelson (BS) effect. A simple accounting
exercise confirms this pattern of relative productivity growth for Lithuania compared to the EA and puts the
BS effects at about 0.7 percentage points, or 73 percent of the observed inflation differential with the EA
since 2000. Econometric estimates, accounting also for inflation persistence, the impact of commodity prices,
and short-run cyclical factors, suggest a long-run BS effect of some 1.1 percentage points annually. The
analysis finds no empirical support for the presence of price convergence channels over and above the BS
effect.
In the short-run, business cycle divergence, asymmetric effects of global commodity price
movements, and idiosyncrasies in wage dynamics can easily swamp the underlying BS dynamics.
Econometric analysis suggests that a one-standard-deviation shock to commodity price growth would cause

This econometric evidence suggests an annual inflation differential of about 0.7 percentage points
vis-à-vis the EA over the next five years. This is contingent on maintaining policy discipline and thus
having strong supporting frameworks in place. It assumes unchanged wage formation processes, historical
productivity differentials, gradually closing output gaps, and commodity prices in line with the IMF’s World
Economic Outlook. In addition, there may be a small one-off inflationary impact from the switch over to the
euro of 0.2 to 0.4 percentage points.

Lithuania’s traditionally prudent fiscal policy
suffered a major setback in the 2008/09 crisis
but it was followed by a determined multiyear consolidation response. Public debt stood
at a mere 15 percent of GDP on the eve of the
crisis, but the deficit deteriorated sharply to 9.4
percent of GDP in the 2009 recession, despite
strong consolidation measures. Determined
subsequent adjustment achieved exit from EDP in
spring 2013 and a deficit near 2 percent of GDP
for 2013.

Sources: IMF World Economic Outlook; and IMF staff calculations.
Lithuania’s public debt-to-GDP ratio remains
low by EU standards and is set to decline further. The debt ratio has now stabilized at some 40 percent of
GDP and would gently decline even in a passive scenario with no further consolidation measures beyond
those embedded in the 2014 budget. The authorities are rightly committed to much more aggressive debt
reduction, with the precise target path to be updated in their 2014 Convergence Program. Rollover, interestrate, and exchange-rate risks to Lithuania’s public debt stock are all well contained.

banks (Snoras and Ukio) are likely to be
repaid and relatively modest in any event at around 2 percent of GDP. Court-mandated compensation for
past pension and wage cuts have yet to be made, but would be a one-off expense of 0.8–1.5 percent of
GDP. This leaves costs related to demographic ageing as the only material concern, which could add 5–6
percent of GDP to public spending by 2060 in the absence of pension reform.

There is substantial potential to strengthen public finances, especially on the revenue side. At around
26 percent of GDP, Lithuania’s overall tax-to-GDP ratio is the lowest in the EU—some 13, 6, and
4 percentage points of GDP lower than the EU, CEE, and the other Baltics average, respectively. This gap
largely reflects generous allowances, exemptions, and preferential rates in Lithuania’s tax system. The
recurrent taxation of wealth and property is underdeveloped. In addition, the estimated share of the shadow
economy (28.5 percent of GDP) is one of the largest in the EU, but bound to retreat with income
convergence.

B. Completing Public Finance Repair and Locking in Gains
17.
The repair of public finances is well advanced but not yet complete. If the fiscal over
performance in 2013 is confirmed, a further moderate deficit reduction of ½ percent of GDP in
structural terms in 2014 would seem sufficient. This would ensure further steady progress toward
the medium-term objective (MTO) of a broadly balanced budget, no undue drag on the economy
that is just returning to full capacity and a genuine decline of the public-debt-to-GDP ratio for the
first time since the 2008/09 crisis. To achieve this consolidation, measures over and above those in
the 2014 budget may be required.4
18.
In the medium run, the authorities would be well advised to temporarily drive
consolidation beyond their MTO. The authorities’ 2013 convergence report sets a structural deficit
of 1 percent of GDP. While sufficient to ensure sound public finances in the long run, it still implies a
rather slow reduction of the public debt ratio that has more than doubled since the crisis (see
second figure in Box 5). A temporarily more ambitious target would be needed to demonstrate the
ability to not only stabilize debt ratios but to materially bring them down after a setback and build
the fiscal buffers to fall back on in the next downturn. Achieving this will require taking measures—
the deficit on current policies (i.e., approved measures) would only decline marginally beyond 2014
(see “passive fiscal projections” in Tables 1 and 2).
19.
Remaining consolidation should preferably come from the revenue side and the
quality of spending should be reviewed. The bulk of the post-crisis consolidation came from
emergency expenditure cuts, leaving Lithuania with one of the lowest expenditure ratios in the EU
and a potentially suboptimal spending structure. Remaining consolidation should therefore be met
by high-quality revenue measures, in particular hitherto underdeveloped recurrent wealth and
capital taxation (Country Report No. 13/82). A public expenditure review could identify areas where
past cuts have gone too far and where there is remaining slack, thereby helping increase the quality
of spending within Lithuania’s tight overall spending envelope. Pension reform and tax
administration improvements are additional key projects to redress the looming costs of
demographic aging.
20.
The compensation schemes for past pension and wage cuts should be carefully
designed, mindful of competing claims on scarce budgetary resources when transposing the court
rulings into concrete proposals. Spreading payments over time would avoid a spike in public
borrowing or derailment of the impending decline of the public debt ratio.
21.
Local government finances require enhanced control. Past spending overruns and
accumulation of arrears are a matter of concern, albeit not of macroeconomic proportions

4

The 2014 budget targets a deficit of 1.9 percent of GDP and the 2013 deficit is estimated in the range 2 to
2½ percent of GDP, with 2.1 percent of GDP being staff’s best point estimate. Gross public debt already declined in
2013 as a ratio to GDP, but this was driven by a drawdown of cash balances rather than a small budget deficit.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA

considering the small size of local governments.5 Debt and borrowing limits for local governments
are soft, as they are adjusted frequently and breaches remain essentially unsanctioned. Moreover,
only spending related to special grants from the central government is independently audited. An
increased revenue share for local governments from 2014 may help, but ultimately it will take hard
budget constraints on their debt and borrowing limits that remain stable over time and independent
scrutiny of their finances to instill better spending discipline and improve incentives to raise
revenues locally.
22.
The authorities fully supported the debt reduction objective. They plan to lower the
headline deficit by about one percentage point each year until a surplus of 1½ percent of GDP is
reached in 2017 to visibly reduce the debt ratio, although concrete underpinning measures are yet
to be specified. The introduction of a car tax was under active consideration but is unpopular. They
plan to stagger compensation payments. Government officials noted that Lithuania already has
several forums that review public spending, but saw potential merit in an independent overarching
exercise that would cover the general government. The authorities agreed in principle with the need
to better control local government finances, but noted that the existing framework of
intergovernmental relations needed to be respected.

C. Maintaining a Sound Financial System that Supports Investment
23.
Much progress has been made in working through crisis legacies. Non-performing loan
ratios have been brought down from a peak of 20 percent to 11 percent, with one major bank
reporting that it will essentially be done with addressing the aftermath of the crisis in the course of
2014. High reliance on parent bank funding has been consigned to the past as loan-to-deposit
ratios fell to 107 percent—a level that parent banks generally feel comfortable with. But progress
has been uneven across banks, meaning that supervisors need to remain vigilant. The authorities are
rightly tackling governance and competency issues in the small credit union sector (2 percent of
financial sector assets) through a combination of stop-gap measures and limited legislative changes
until a broader reform of the sector can be put in

Yet, private sector credit shows only
tepid signs of recovery at best. Staff analysis for
the Baltic Cluster Report confirms that “creditless
recoveries” are to be expected after large financial
boom-bust cycles like those experienced by the
Baltic economies. However, even by this benchmark,
real private sector credit growth should have turned
positive by now, but has not. Both credit demand

45

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA

and supply factors seem to be responsible, with strong risk aversion now entrenched in potential
borrowers and banks. Accordingly, banks chase after perceived good credits—large and successful
firms—while SMEs and new companies risk falling by the wayside. Credit developments require
close monitoring. Further improvements in the insolvency frameworks could help support more
credit to the economy.6 And fostering more reliance on other sources for financing investment, such
as capital market development and leasing, is worth considering.
25.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment of the financial sector. They felt
that the financial sector is characterized by a high degree of stability, following the successful
intervention of two domestic banks in 2011 and 2013. Remaining areas of softness, such as the
credit union sector, were well under control. A consultation paper on fundamental credit union
reform had already been issued and the four most problematic credit unions (out of a total of some
80 credit unions) have been closed in the past two years. The authorities indicated that they intend
to participate in the Asset Quality Review ahead of planned euro adoption. They thought that
progress in reducing NPLs and loan-to-deposit ratios improved prospects for a resumption of credit
growth, but agreed that investment could be hampered if it failed to materialize in the not-toodistant future. They agreed that capital markets played only a marginal financing role, in part due to
shallow domestic markets failing to attract investor interest. Efforts to complete the already welladvanced regional integration of Baltic exchanges are underway.

D. Advancing Structural Reform to Further Income Convergence
26.
Lithuania’s export sector has been key to postcrisis recovery and all efforts should be made to extend
its success. As documented in the Baltic Cluster Report,
exports were a key driver in pulling the economy out of the
2009 recession and facilitating the correction of the large
current account deficits. Longer-term, Lithuania has been
gaining global market share, successfully upgraded product
quality, and reoriented away from traditional CIS markets.
Yet, success relied to a large extent on labor intensive
exports, and was also facilitated by favorable trading partner
growth and export price developments, while involvement in
global value chains has been more limited. Future success
can therefore not be taken for granted, especially as
demographic aging becomes more acute. Cost

Staff analysis suggests: (i) exploring whether the limited progress of household debt resolution under the law
reflects teething problems or undue administrative hurdles; (ii) equipping the corporate restructuring law with the
necessary tools for going-concern restructurings, such as protection for fresh money and lower voting thresholds to
get creditor consent for restructuring plans; (iii) providing more scope for compromise in corporate enterprise
bankruptcy to facilitate, e.g., debt-equity swaps and reduce reliance on auctions.

in exports, should be preserved and direct obstacles to global value chain involvement should be
addressed. But much of the critical support for the export sector would need to come from more
general structural reforms—to make the most of labor resources, upgrade key infrastructure, strive
to advance the business climate further, and tap synergies from regional cooperation.
27.
Labor resources need to be better utilized. As analyzed in the Baltic Cluster Report, high
structural unemployment seems to coexist with otherwise fairly flexible labor markets. The current
unemployment rate of 11.4 percent is found to be essentially entirely structural, with strong wage
pressures emerging at materially lower rates. Reducing the significant skill mismatches ultimately
requires reform of an education system that features one of the highest tertiary education rates in
the EU, but where many graduates work in fields other than those of their study, emigrate, or take
up work below their qualifications. Unemployment benefits are moderate by OECD standards, but
the uncontrolled tapping of multiple benefit programs, along with relatively high labor taxation,
could still create unemployment traps for workers

augmented by fostering the return of emigrants
and easing labor market access for non-EU citizens.
28.
Upgrading the energy and transportation infrastructure remains a high priority.
Important projects in the gas, electricity, and rail sectors are underway. Russia is currently the sole
supplier of natural gas, and also an important provider of oil and electricity. Energy prices are high
and scope for effective downstream competition limited. Railroad infrastructure is well suited for
trade with the CIS, but there are few north-south lines and tracks with Western European gauge.
Projects should be carried out in the context of a regional strategic plan, so as to share costs and
exploit scope for synergies, and geared toward the ultimate objective of reducing user costs and
increasing the efficiency of the economy.
29.
Reform of public enterprises should be advanced, especially as they would play a key
role in carrying out the large infrastructure projects. Already initiated governance reform of
state-owned enterprises should be pushed forward—to achieve tangible results in terms of more
independent directors on enterprise boards and faster progress toward return-on-equity targets—
and broadened to also cover municipally-owned enterprises.
30.
The authorities pointed to the many reform initiatives already underway on the
structural front. While skeptical whether historical reliance on labor-intensive exports and limited
18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA

involvement in global value chains necessarily create a problem for the future, they broadly
concurred with the policy recommendations. Improving energy security and efficiency through new
cross-border gas and electricity linkages has long been a policy priority and key projects, such as the
LNG terminal, will become operational by year end. As staff, they consider current unemployment as
mostly structural. A working group for a revamp of the labor code has already been formed and
government recently adopted broad guidelines for migration policies, but comprehensive reform of
social security taxation would be considered only after completion of euro adoption. They noted
Lithuania’s favorable ranking in the World Bank’s “Ease of Doing Business” report. Recent further
improvements to the business climate included reform of territorial planning and streamlining of
business inspection regimes.

STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
The economy has entered a broadly favorable trajectory of healthy and balanced
growth, but income convergence with Western Europe has a long way to go. With output
expanding at 3–3½ percent, peak income levels of 2008 are set to be surpassed this year, but this
time in a sustainable manner. Nonetheless, the large income gap with Western Europe underscores
the need to continue with the disciplined policy approach and persevere with reform to modernize
the economy. The impetus will increasingly have to come from the structural front as dividends from
macroeconomic adjustment run their course.
32.
Euro adoption in 2015 would be the next logical step on Lithuania’s European
integration path. It would remove one of the few remaining vulnerabilities—low international
reserve coverage, reduce risk premiums by strengthening financial stability, and bring integration
gains from fostering trade, FDI, and global-value-chain involvement. Lithuania seems ready for euro
adoption, in terms of meeting the entry criteria, sustainability of low inflation and public finances,
and external stability.
33.
Euro adoption is an opportunity to upgrade supporting policy frameworks and ensure
that EMU membership is a lasting success. Two decades of operating under a currency board
arrangement have amply demonstrated that Lithuania has the economic flexibility and political grit
to deliver adjustment when needed without recourse to independent monetary policy. However, the
business cycle was poorly controlled, pointing to gaps in policy frameworks. This will be addressed
with the impending strengthening of macroprudential policy tools and the transposition of the fiscal
compact, but a mechanism to reliably build fiscal buffers in economic upswings is still missing.
34.
Much progress has been made in restoring healthy public finances but a final
consolidation push is still needed. A determined multi-year effort has brought the fiscal deficit
comfortably below Maastricht limits and the public debt ratio is now stabilizing. But the mediumterm objective of a broadly balanced budget is not yet reached and the ability to materially reduce
the debt ratio remains to be demonstrated. Consolidation has to continue. It should preferably
come from the revenue side, with more reliance on hitherto underdeveloped recurrent taxation of

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA

wealth and capital. After extensive expenditure cuts since the crisis, a public expenditure review
would help ensure that the overall tight spending envelope is efficiently used and sustainable.
35.
Financial stability has strengthened further, with rising bank capitalization and the
intervention of two insolvent banks in 2011 and 2013. Remaining areas of softness, such as
those in the small credit union sector, are rightly being addressed with determination.
36.
Delays in the recovery of credit are a potential area of concern that requires close
monitoring. Progress with reducing non-performing loans and now well contained loan-to-deposit
ratios should help lay the foundations for a resumption of credit growth, but it has yet to materialize
and is delayed by historical standards. If it remained elusive for much longer, investment, critical for
the modernization of the economy, could be constrained. Further strengthening of the insolvency
and restructuring regimes should be considered, along with steps to foster capital market
development.
37.
Labor resources need to be better utilized. Structural unemployment is uncomfortably
high, which is particularly problematic when considering the impeding onset of demographic aging
and an external sector that thrives on labor-intensive exports. While Lithuanian labor institutions are
fairly flexible, there is room to reform the labor code and improve the management of out-of-work
benefits. Reducing high labor taxation would also be desirable, but would need to be imbedded in
comprehensive tax and pension reform to be fiscally neutral. Addressing skill mismatches will
ultimately require comprehensive education reform.
38.
In other structural reforms, upgrading of the energy and transportation infrastructure
remains a high priority. The many ongoing projects should be embedded in a regional strategic
plan geared toward reducing user costs. Reform of state-owned enterprises—many of them
responsible for the infrastructure projects—should be pushed ahead and broadened to municipallyowned enterprises.
39.
It is recommended that the next Article IV Consultation be held on the twelve-month
cycle.

1/ Excluding foreign bank branches.
2/ Total profits (losses) after tax. Interim quarterly results are annualised.
3/ From end-2005 to Q1-2008, NPLs are loans overdue more than 60 days. Untill 2004 NPLs are loans in Substandard, Doubtful and Loss loans categories.
4/ Starting June 2008, non-performing loans are defined as the sum of impaired loans and non-impaired loans that are overdue more than 60 days.
5/ Large exposure means loans granted to the borrower the net value of which equals to, or exceeds, 10 per cent of bank capital.
6/ Credit registry data from 2005. According to Nace 1. Due to ongoing revisions to Nace 2, no data available for 2011-12.
7/ Composition of liquid assets and current liabilities is defined in the Liquidity Ratio Calculation Rules approved by Resolution No. 1 of
the Board of the Bank of Lithuania of 29 January 2004.
8/ Data as of the end of period.
9/ As defined in Rules for Calculation of Capital Adequacy approved by Bank of Lithuania Board Resolution No. 138 of 9 November 2006.
10/ Information is based on interbank deals of all maturities (mostly overnights) made between resident banks in national currency within the last quarter of the period.
11/ The large majority of foreign currency loans and foreign currency liabilities are in euros, to which the national currency is pegged via a currency board arrangement.
12/ Specific provisions include provisions against general portfolio risk until end-2004. From end-2005, due to the change in definition of NPLs, specific
provisions are not directly attributable to the NPLs. Therefore, the ratio may be negative.
13/ Specific provisions include allowances for both individually and collectively assessed loans.

shocks. Figures in the boxes represent average projections for the respective variables in the
baseline and scenario being presented. Ten-year historical average for the variable is also shown.
2/ For historical scenarios, the historical averages are calculated over the ten-year period, and the
information is used to project debt dynamics five years ahead.
3/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and current
account balance.
4/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent occurs in 2014.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

1/ Public sector is defined as general government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over German bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Anti-Money Laundering and Combating Financing of Terrorism: Lithuania’s compliance with the
Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standard, was last assessed by MONEYVAL, the FATF-style regional
body of which it is a member, in April 2012. The assessment report was published in December 2012 and
indicates several deficiencies, in particular with respect to the money laundering offense, customer due
diligence measures, politically exposed persons, transparency of beneficial ownership of legal persons,
and the financial intelligence unit. In response, the authorities reported to Moneyval that measures have
been undertaken to amend the Criminal Code to properly criminalize the financing and support of
terrorism, broaden the definition of money laundering, and enhance capacity and autonomy of the
Financial Crime Investigation Unit.

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA

STATISTICAL ISSUES
General: Over the past several years, Lithuania has made good progress in establishing a macroeconomic
database. Official data for all sectors are adequate for surveillance purposes. Lithuania subscribed to the
Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) in May 1996, and its metadata have been posted on the Fund’s
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB) since April 1997. Lithuania meets the SDDS specifications for
coverage, periodicity and timeliness of the data, and for the dissemination of the advance release calendars. A
significant amount of economic and financial information is now available on various websites through the
Internet (see section on Dissemination of Statistics, below). A ROSC data module was published in November
2002. Data provision to the Fund for surveillance purposes is considered adequate.
National Accounts: The national accounts are compiled by Statistics Lithuania (SL) (the former Department of
Statistics) in accordance with the guidelines of the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA 95). Quarterly GDP
estimates at current and at constant prices are compiled using both the production and expenditure
approaches. GDP estimates by production are considered to be more reliable than the corresponding
estimates by expenditure, but no statistical discrepancies between these two estimates are shown separately in
the published figures as the discrepancies are included in the estimates of changes in inventories. The annual
and the quarterly national accounts are compiled at previous year prices and chain-linked to 2000. In general,
good data sources and sound methods are used for the compilation of the national accounts, but measuring
activity during the volatile environment of the 2008/09 crisis proved challenging. Moreover, difficulties remain
in measuring the economic activity of the informal sector. These estimates are compiled at detailed levels of
economic activity using fixed coefficients derived from a benchmark surveys conducted in 1996 and 2003, and
updated in 2006, and in 2011. According to the most recent updates, the informal sector was estimated to be
13 percent of GDP in 2008.
Price Statistics: Since December 1998, CPI weights have been updated annually. The monthly CPI is available
in the second week following the reference month. The producer price index is calculated according to the
chain-linked Laspeyres formula with weights updated every year.
Government Finance Statistics: Data on the central government budget execution are available at a monthly
and quarterly frequency, although these data are subject to frequent revisions. The ongoing treasury project is
expected to improve fiscal data quality substantially. However, further work is needed to clarify the treatment
of public health care providers and of EU transactions, and the consolidation procedure for government
operations. A new classification, incorporating the GFSM2001 was approved in mid-2003. Since then, the MoF
has been reporting to STA general government’s annual data on an accrual and cash basis (except for local
governments, which are still on a cash basis) for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook
(GFSY). In addition, the MoF has been reporting quarterly and monthly data in the GFSM 2001 format for
publication in the IFS.
Monetary Statistics: The Bank of Lithuania (BoL) reports monetary and financial statistics (MFS) to STA on a
timely and regular basis. The scope, concepts and definitions of the MFS are broadly in line with the guidelines
of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). Following Lithuania’s accession to the European

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA

Union, the BoL implemented the ECB framework for compiling and reporting monetary data reflecting the ECB
regulations and ESA 95 on sectorization, valuation and classification of financial instruments.
Balance of Payments: The BoL is responsible for compiling balance of payments, international investment
position (IIP), external debt and international reserves statistics. The BoL reports quarterly data on balance of
payments, IIP and monthly international reserves to STA on a timely and regular basis. Balance of payments
data (on a monthly and quarterly basis) are compiled using the format recommended in the Balance of
Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5). The monthly data correspond to several key balance of payments
components, compiled on the basis of a sample survey covering the public sector, commercial banks, and
some nonfinancial private sector institutions. The Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign
Currency Liquidity is disseminated monthly according to the operational guidelines and is hyperlinked to the
Fund’s DSBB. Since late 2004, the BoL disseminates quarterly external debt data in the World Bank’s Quarterly
External Debt Statistics (QEDS) database.
Data Standards and Quality: The authorities publish a range of economic statistics through a number of
publications, including the SL's monthly publication, Economic and Social Developments, and the BoL's
monthly Bulletin. A significant amount of data is available on the Internet:


metadata for data categories defined by the Special Data Dissemination Standard are posted on the
IMF’s DSBB (http://dsbb.imf.org);



the BoL website (http://www.lb.lt/statistical_data_tree) provides data on monetary statistics, treasury
bill auction results, balance of payments, IIP, external debt and other main economic indicators;



the SL website (http://www.stat.gov.lt/lt/) provides monthly and quarterly information on economic
and social development indicators;



the MoF (http://www.finmin.lt) home page includes data on the national budget, as well as
information on laws and privatization; and government finance statistics (deficit, debt).



NASDAQ OMX Baltic website (http://www.nasdaqomxbaltic.com/market/?lang=en) includes
information on stock trading at NASDAQ OMX Baltic stock Exchange in Vilnius (the former Vilnius
Stock Exchange)

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with
the Republic of Lithuania
On May 5, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Lithuania.
The economy has entered a broadly favorable trajectory of healthy and balanced growth, but
income convergence with Western Europe has a long way to go. With growth above three
percent in each of the past three years and similar prospects, real GDP is set to surpass the peak
level of 2008 for the first time this year, but now free of external and internal imbalances.
Nonetheless, per capita income remains considerably below Western European levels and
structural unemployment is uncomfortably high.
Lithuania targets to adopt the euro next year to further deepen integration with Western Europe.
With inflation at historical lows and well-advanced repair of public finances damaged by the
2008/09 crisis, meeting the entry criteria seems on track. The Economic and Financial Affairs
Council of the European Union will take a final decision about EMU membership this July,
based on convergence reports by the European Commission and the European Central Bank.
A determined multi-year consolidation effort has reduced the fiscal deficit to close to 2 percent
of GDP in 2013. Public debt is now on the verge of starting to decline as a ratio to GDP. At
around 40 percent of GDP it is relatively low compared to other EU countries.
Financial stability has improved further in 2013, with the capital adequacy ratio exceeding
17 percent and steady progress in reducing non-performing loans. The main challenge is now
resuscitating sluggish private sector credit growth, which could undermine investment and the
recovery if it continued for much longer.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted that the pursuit of prudent policies has led to robust balanced growth,
falling inflation, and strengthened public finances, thereby placing Lithuania on track for euro
adoption in January 2015. Looking ahead, with risks still tilted to the downside, Directors
recommended the consolidation of recent macroeconomic gains, and a deepening of structural
reforms to provide the impetus for sustainable job-creating growth and income convergence with
Western Europe.
Directors commended the strengthening of the public finances in recent years, but noted that
expenditure compression is reaching its practical limits after bearing the burden of recent
adjustment. They called for further, well-calibrated fiscal consolidation through enhanced
revenue mobilization, to help achieve a structural budget balance in the medium term and reduce
the public debt-to-GDP ratio. Recurrent taxation of wealth and capital could be improved, the tax
base broadened and tax administration strengthened. Directors also considered that a public
expenditure review would help promote efficiency and sustainability.
With sound public finances and low inflation, as well as external stability, Directors agreed that
the Lithuanian economy is well prepared for euro adoption, which could deliver significant
benefits by strengthening financial stability, reducing risk premiums, and fostering further
integration with the euro area. Directors recommended strong supporting policy frameworks and
macro policy tools to help underpin a successful euro area membership. While Lithuania has
demonstrated the ability to deliver economic adjustment when needed, Directors advised
strengthening countercyclical tools to rebuild buffers in good economic times. In this regard,
they welcomed the impending strengthening of macroprudential powers of the Bank of Lithuania
and the planned transposition of the Fiscal Compact. Directors advised improving the
accountability and control framework for local government finances and noted that pension
reform was needed to enhance fiscal sustainability.
Directors considered that decisive action and effective supervision have improved overall
financial sector stability and welcomed efforts to tackle remaining areas of softness, such as in
the small credit union sector. They advised that these efforts be sustained, and looked forward to
a review of banks’ asset quality. Directors called for a revival of credit growth in support of
investment, through further strengthening of insolvency and restructuring frameworks and
fostering non-bank sources of finance.
Directors recommended continued implementation of structural reforms to further improve
competitiveness and the business climate and tackle high structural unemployment. Wage

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

increases should be aligned with productivity growth, and the management of out-of-work
benefits and other key aspects of the labor code strengthened. Reducing Lithuania’s relatively
high social security taxes in a fiscally-neutral manner would be desirable, as well as redressing
skill mismatches through education reform.
Directors welcomed the emphasis on upgrading energy and transportation infrastructure, and
advised that ongoing projects should be embedded in a regional strategy to reduce user costs.
They supported reform of state- and municipally-owned enterprises—with many of the former
tasked with implementing key infrastructure projects.

Statement by Mr. Audun Groenn, Executive Director for the Republic of Lithuania
and by Ms. Ramune Arust, Advisor to the Executive Director
May 5, 2014
Our Lithuanian authorities appreciate the constructive and forward-looking discussions with
the staff mission team and thank them for a well-balanced Article IV Report. They broadly
share its analysis and assessment of the country’s economic outlook, as well as staff’s view
of the challenges to be addressed to make the prospective euro area membership a lasting
success.
Strong GDP growth continues on a healthy and balanced path
Since 2011, Lithuania has remained one of the fastest growing economies in the European
Union, and last year was no exception. GDP, which at the end of 2013 was 2 percent below
the pre-crisis level, is expected to reach that pre-crisis level this year, on a more robust
footing. At the beginning of this year, high-frequency economic indicators show that strong
growth continues as expected. More importantly, economic growth has become more
balanced and sustainable, with the tradable sector obtaining higher weight in overall
economic activity. The composition of GDP is also becoming more broad-based. While
exports remained traditionally strong, private consumption picked up significantly and was
the main driver for economic growth in 2013.
Our authorities broadly share staff’s view of the economic outlook and expect a strong and
balanced economic growth this year and in the medium term. Strengthened domestic demand
is expected to be the main factor driving future growth, since the private consumption is
supported by an improving situation in the labor market and low inflation. Investments are
also set to increase in view of capacity utilization being at a record high. However, moderate
economic growth for Lithuania’s trading partners and a fluid geopolitical situation in the
region create elevated risks for exports.
Positive impulse is expected from the prospective Euro adoption
Lithuania aims at sustainable fulfillment of the Maastricht criteria with a target date to adopt
the euro on January 1, 2015. The goal to introduce the euro is based on a legal obligation
under the EU Treaty, policy consistency, proven economic flexibility and capacity to operate
under the fixed exchange rate regime, as well as the high level trade and financial integration
with the euro area.
The economy is on a solid and sustainable recovery path. The crisis response proved to be
efficient and imbalances have been corrected. With the lack of clear pressure in the labor
market and with commodity prices continuing to drop, consumer prices are rising only
slightly and less than expected. Fiscal policy has been put on a sustainable path. The
authorities have learned their lessons from the past and have been focused on building a

2
balanced and competitive economy. To ensure stable economic growth and further
convergence, the authorities have introduced new and more powerful macro-policy tools.
The Fiscal Discipline Law was enacted to ensure fiscal discipline. To increase the resilience
of the financial sector, macro-prudential instruments (85 percent loan-to-value ratio (LTV)
and 40 percent debt service-to-income ratio (DSTI)) were introduced by the Bank of
Lithuania (BoL).
At the same time, the authorities are fully aware that policy prudence, especially on the fiscal
side, will remain a key prerequisite for successful functioning in the euro area, helping to
avoid the emergence of macroeconomic imbalance.
Adoption of the euro is expected to have a significant positive effect on Lithuania’s economy
through the enhancement of economic integration. A quantitative assessment of the likely
impact of the adoption of the euro shows that the positive effect of introducing the euro will
be felt by citizens, businesses, and government finances. In the medium term, a successful
integration into the euro zone is expected to boost Lithuania’s real GDP on average by
1.8 percent.
The level of public debt has stabilized
A prudent fiscal policy underpinned by the law on Fiscal Discipline and the Stability and
Growth pact is at the core of Lithuania’s policy framework to ensure macroeconomic
stability. Lithuania continues to strengthen its fiscal framework through transposing the
provisions of the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in EMU (“Fiscal
Compact”) into its national legal system, including the constitutional law on the
implementation of the fiscal treaty that lays down commitment to sustainability of general
government finances.
Last year the fiscal budget deficit turned out to be markedly smaller than expected
(2.2 percent instead of the planned 2.5 percent of GDP). This improvement in the country’s
fiscal position was driven by accelerating revenues from corporate and household income
taxes. A steadily decreasing budget deficit since the crisis firmly stabilized the ratio of public
debt to GDP just below 40 percent of GDP and is expected to start decreasing after 2014.
The authorities are committed to continuing a growth-friendly fiscal consolidation at a pace
aiming to reach a structural budget surplus of 0.9 percent of GDP in 2017. According to the
government’s program, a further budget consolidation will be based on strengthening tax
administration and rising revenues through initiatives that support economic growth and
create new jobs. There are a number of major legal initiatives and conventional measures
coming to tackle the shadow economy and improve tax administration. The government has
already proposed amendments to the laws regulating tax administration and the value added
tax (VAT). Besides, the consolidated view is being applied and specific measures are
envisaged with a focus on ensuring the VAT, excise duty obligation compliance, as well as
on strengthening collection of taxes on personal income. In addition, discussions on a

3
comprehensive review of the tax system will continue, with particular emphasis on reviewing
taxation on labor and the application of reduced VAT rates.
On the expenditure side, particular attention is paid to the efficient use of resources and
prioritization. No cuts to productive, job-creating expenditures, such as investment and
expenditures on research and development, are foreseen.
The authorities share staff’s concerns about the deficiencies in the control framework of local
government finances and are ready to address them. The government is considering asking
the Fund to provide technical assistance to improve the accountability and control framework
of local government finances. The initial talks with the Fund on such assistance have already
started.
The financial sector is stable and resilient
Lithuania’s financial system remains stable and resilient. The banking sector is well
capitalized and liquid. In 2013 the capital adequacy ratio improved by 2 percentage points
and reached 17.6 percent. This higher capital adequacy ratio was achieved by retaining
profits. The liquidity ratio at 41.2 percent was well above the required level of 30 percent.
The continuously improving quality of loan portfolios as well as measures undertaken by the
authorities to improve the legal and regulatory framework for NPL resolutions are also
yielding results. In 2013, NPLs decreased to 11 percent.
Although the stock of outstanding credit has not been increasing, credit flows to the economy
continue at a steady pace. In 2013, new loans to non-financial corporations and households
amounted to 15.9 billion litas (16.0 billion litas in 2012) or 13.3 percent of GDP, of which
70 percent was lent to non-financial corporations. Commercial banks in Lithuania expect a
2–3 percent growth in their loan portfolio this year.
The financial sector supervision is focused on identification of risks and decision making at
an early stage. The BoL has shifted to a risk-based supervisory process by concentrating on
systemically important and high risk financial market participants.
The government together with the BoL devotes substantial efforts to strengthen and reform
credit union regulation. The current reform aims to make the credit union sector strong,
sustainable, and able to effectively complement the existing banking sector. To reform this
sector, an inter-institutional working group (comprised of representatives from the Ministry
of Finance, the BoL, the Central Credit Union of Lithuania, and credit union associations)
has prepared draft laws for the regulation of credit union activities. This draft legislation has
been submitted to parliament for discussion and subsequent approval.
Alongside these efforts, the BoL has prepared a document for public discussion on how to
reform the credit union sector. Particular attention is given to eliminating the moral hazard
problem and aligning shareholders’ incentives with prudent risk taking. The reform proposals

4
draw extensively upon Lithuania’s own experience and international best practice. The
document also incorporates recommendations provided by the Fund’s technical assistance,
which is highly appreciated by the authorities.
On other supervisory matters, the authorities are working on the implementation of CRD IV
into national laws. The preliminary assessment shows that, due to the high quality of Tier I
capital of the banks, reduced capital requirements for FX positions (if the euro is adopted),
decreasing of risk weights for small and medium enterprises exposures, the introduction of
releasing regime for exposures secured by mortgages on residential property and other
measures, the implementation of the new requirements would contribute to increasing the
capital adequacy ratio.
The government and the BoL are also preparing for changes to the financial sector’s
supervisory framework related to the prospective euro area membership, including the asset
quality review (AQR) exercise and necessary adjustments of legal acts. In December 2013,
the Board of the BoL approved the position of the BoL on participation in the Banking
Union. The base case scenario is that Lithuania joins the Single Supervisory Mechanism
(SSM) and Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) in 2015, together with the accession in the
euro area. It is expected that after joining the SSM, the ECB would take supervision of the
3 largest banks (71 percent of the market share), while other banks would remain under the
direct supervision of the BoL.
The process of broadening the BoL’s mandate to include macro-prudential policy is nearly
complete. The relevant amendments to the Law of the Bank of Lithuania granting the macroprudential mandate is expected to be adopted during the Spring parliamentary session ending
in June 2014. Currently, the BoL indirectly pursues macro-prudential policy by empowering
the Responsible Lending Regulations approved in 2011. In addition to LTV and DSTI, a
wide macroprudential toolkit specified in the EU level legislation is envisaged to apply once
CRD IV is transposed into the national legislation. It is expected that countercyclical capital
buffer application will become fully operational in the end of 2014, whereas an interim
decision has been made to apply a 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer starting in 2015.
Structural reforms aim to create more jobs
The government is continuing its policies of promoting pro-growth structural policy
measures, such as improving the business environment and reducing high unemployment.
Despite significant improvement in employment trends over the recent years, unemployment
remains high, especially for the youth and the long-term unemployed. This is a priority area
for the authorities. To address this situation, the government is taking measures on both the
labor demand and supply sides. On the labor demand side, the authorities continue to support
a number of investment projects expected to raise the supply side potential of the economy.
The housing renovation project has advanced considerably since its start in 2012. The energy

5
sector reforms are also very high on the agenda. The Liquid Gas Terminal (LNG) in Klaipėda
is expected to be completed by the end of this year.
On the labor supply side, the government is taking active measures to realign worker skills
with employer needs. Active labor market policies, training and dialogue with educational
institutions has been enhanced. To reduce the administrative burden of labor market
regulations, a number of amendments to the Labor Code have been submitted to parliament
for approval. Also, a working group has been established for a comprehensive review of the
Labor Code.
Lithuania has further improved its business environment. In 2013 Lithuania moved to the
17th position among all countries and the 6th position among EU countries in the World Bank
“Ease of doing business report 2014”. The adopted new territorial planning laws, together
with labor market flexibility, technological innovations, and high participation of women in
the workforce, have all contributed to these high rankings.
