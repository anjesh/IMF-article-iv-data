IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Spain

On July 27, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Spain.
Spain’s recovery has gathered speed, but unemployment is still very high. Growth has picked up
and is expected at 3.1 percent in 2015 and 2.5 percent in 2016, well above the euro area average.
Strong policy implementation has supported the return of confidence, and significant external
tailwinds are helping the rebound. The current account maintains a small surplus while financial
conditions remain supportive. The pace of private sector deleveraging has slowed and new credit
is being extended. Job creation has picked up, but more than 5 million people remain
unemployed and new jobs still rely heavily on temporary and part-time contracts.
Past reforms are contributing to the recovery. Spain’s labor market reforms and moderate wage
growth have supported employment and helped regain competitiveness. The Market Unity Law
has begun to address some of the obstacles for firms to grow and raise productivity. The positive
report card from the European Central Bank’s comprehensive assessment confirmed that the
country’s financial sector reform efforts have progressed well, supported by the European
Stability Mechanism. These reforms, together with continued fiscal consolidation, have
reassured markets and boosted consumer and investor confidence.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A
staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic
developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board.

However, deep structural problems limit Spain’s growth potential going forward and
vulnerabilities remain. The high structural unemployment and pervasive labor market duality,
and the lack of economies of scale of Spain’s many small firms hold back medium-term growth.
Public and private debt levels are still high and are likely to keep weighing on consumption and
investment. Spain has a large negative net international investment position, which adds to its
external vulnerabilities. In this context, a key risk is a reversal of reforms already carried out,
which would create uncertainty and could hamper the recovery, especially if the external
environment were to deteriorate sharply.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their strong policy implementation and
reform efforts, which, complemented by easier financing conditions, have enhanced confidence
and underpinned Spain’s remarkable rebound from the crisis. They noted in particular that labor
market reforms and wage moderation have boosted jobs and competitiveness. However, despite
significant adjustments in key economic flows over the past few years, the persistently high level
of unemployment, low productivity, and still sizable public and private debts continue to pose
policy challenges for the period ahead.
Against this background, Directors emphasized that sustaining the growth momentum over the
medium term requires continued fiscal consolidation and steadfast reforms to address remaining
structural rigidities, as well as favorable demand conditions in the broader euro area. Financial
volatility and uncertainty in the region warrant continued vigilance, although Spain’s improved
resilience, along with policy measures at the euro-area level, has reduced contagion risks.
Directors saw merit in further improving the labor market and the conditions for small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to grow, with a view to generating jobs and fostering higher,
more inclusive growth. They recommended keeping wages in line with productivity and business

Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can

conditions at the firm level, lowering labor market duality, and strengthening the skills of the
long-term unemployed. Directors welcomed initiatives to promote competition, especially in the
services sector, support the internationalization of SMEs, and improve their access to finance.
Directors noted that Spain’s financial sector continues to strengthen, with improved liquidity,
efficiency, and profitability. They welcomed the recent insolvency reforms, including the
approval of a “fresh start” for entrepreneurs and consumers. With effective implementation and
clarity on some key elements, these reforms can facilitate private sector deleveraging while
ensuring that a strong payment culture is protected. Directors supported ongoing efforts to
encourage banks to boost their high-quality capital and reduce nonperforming loans, thereby
facilitating credit growth.
Directors emphasized the importance of placing the public debt-to-GDP ratio firmly on a
downward path by pursuing gradual growth-friendly fiscal consolidation and saving any windfall
from higher nominal growth and lower borrowing costs. They called for ambitious and wellspecified budget measures, while protecting the most vulnerable. Improvements to the regional
fiscal framework and close coordination across all levels of the government are also critical to
these consolidation efforts.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. The recovery has strengthened and employment is increasing, driven by the
rebound in consumption and investment. Reforms and strong policy implementation
have supported the return of confidence, and significant external tailwinds are helping.
However, the level of unemployment remains very high and without further reforms the
growth momentum is expected to slow in the medium-term. This reflects still sizable
public and private debt overhangs and persistent structural problems, including
remaining impediments in the labor market and the low productivity of Spain’s many
small firms.
Policies. Sustaining the current high levels of growth and job creation over the medium
term and further reducing vulnerabilities will require additional policy efforts. Key
priorities include the following:


Enhancing labor market performance. Maintaining wage growth in line with
developments in productivity and external competitiveness, ensuring wages
adequately reflect differing business conditions across firms, lowering duality, and
enhancing the skills of the long-term unemployed will improve prospects for higher
and more inclusive growth also in the medium term.



Supporting growth of small firms. Removing obstacles for Spain’s many small
firms to grow will allow them to benefit from economies of scale both in domestic
and external markets and raise productivity.



Facilitating private deleveraging. Continuing to reduce firm and, especially,
household debt will foster investment and growth. Further strengthening the
banking system will ensure that banks can support growth as credit demand
recovers.



Anchoring confidence. Sustaining a gradual and growth-friendly fiscal
consolidation, well coordinated across all levels of governments, will help maintain
strong market confidence and put public debt on a firmly declining path.

Borrowing costs of Spanish corporates and households have fallen as well, although the decline
came later. Employment has increased with the rebound in demand and moderate wage growth. At
the same time, a significant share of the jobs created still takes the form of temporary and part-time
contracts. More than 5 million Spaniards, over 23 percent of the labor force, remain unemployed,

2.
The reforms are making a difference. Labor market reforms and moderate wage growth
have supported job creation and helped Spain regain competitiveness lost during the pre-crisis
boom. The Market Unity Law has begun to address some of the obstacles for firms to grow and
raise productivity. The progress achieved by financial sector reform, supported by the European
Stability Mechanism, has been confirmed by the positive outcome of the ECB’s comprehensive
assessment. Together with continued fiscal consolidation, these reforms have reassured markets,
consumers, and investors alike.

3.
Deleveraging is slowing and new credit is being extended, especially to firms with
strong financial positions. New credit to households is also growing. This comes on the back of
improving banking sector performance, with increased capital and earnings, improved asset quality
and provisioning, and more favorable funding conditions. There are also signs that the real estate
sector might have begun to turn the corner. After a long period of decline, housing prices started to
increase moderately in the second half of 2014—albeit unevenly across regions—and investment
and employment in construction have started to recover (Figure 2).
4.
The current account maintains a small surplus, but external vulnerabilities remain. As
in past recoveries, imports accelerated with the strong rebound in domestic demand. However, the
external current account registered a 0.8 percent of GDP surplus in 2014. This reflects, in part,
healthy export growth supported by regained competiveness from price and wage moderation.
Employment in the tradables sector has been relatively resilient throughout the crisis as more firms
turned towards external markets. However, Spain’s negative net international investment position
(NIIP), while expected to improve in the medium term, is still among the highest in Europe at
93 percent of GDP in 2014 (Figure 3).1 Given the need to improve the NIIP, the cyclically adjusted
current account remained ½ to 2½ percent of GDP weaker than what would be consistent with
medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings, and staff assesses that the real effective
exchange rate (REER) is still about 5–10 percent overvalued (see Appendix I for the External Stability
Report, ESR).
5.
Against this background, the growth momentum is expected to carry on this year and
next. The forces driving private consumption and corporate investment are expected to weaken
only gradually, while construction investment should continue its moderate recovery. Net exports
will profit from the gradual pickup in euro area activity and the expected continuation of
improvements in competitiveness, helped by moderate wage growth. Overall, real GDP growth is
expected at 3.1 percent in 2015 and 2½ percent in 2016, well above the euro area average.
6.
However, deep structural problems
remain and vulnerabilities persist, limiting
Spain’s growth potential in the medium term.
As the recovery matures and tailwinds dissipate,
growth is bound to decline to levels closer to
Spain’s still very low rate of potential growth of
less than 1½ percent. Absent further reforms, this
will leave unemployment at its estimated
structural level of about 16½ percent even as the
output gap closes. Moreover, a strong link
between domestic demand and imports is
expected to persist and will continue to curb the

scope for current account improvement as growth strengthens. Multiple factors are holding back
the prospect for well balanced growth in the medium-term:


Labor market challenges. Structural unemployment is persistently high and the crisis has
lengthened unemployment spells and aggravated skill deficits, especially for the young.
Moreover, duality is still pervasive, and labor market participation is declining. A lack of
differentiation in wage dynamics across firms slows the reallocation of labor toward more
productive sectors.



Low productivity. Spanish firms tend to be smaller, less productive, and less export-oriented than
their European peers. A number of obstacles prevent them from generating economies of scale
domestically as well as externally, which would allow them to compete more successfully in
global markets and against imports.



Continuing deleveraging. Private and public debt levels remain high, at 235 and 98 percent of
GDP, respectively. Household debt, in particular, is still significantly above its pre-crisis levels
(Figures 4 and 8). Hence, deleveraging is likely to proceed, continuing to weigh on domestic
demand (Box 1).

7.
Vulnerabilities amplify risks on the downside. Risks of contagion from developments in
Greece remain significant. Although the initial market reaction from the recent breakdown in
negotiations with official creditors and the Greek referendum have been contained, there is still
substantial uncertainty about potential spillovers. Depending on the final outcome, heightened
uncertainty could weigh on market sentiment and renew sovereign and financial sector stress in
Spain. These risks, however, would be mitigated if timely and effective policy measures are
implemented at the euro area level, including—if necessary—an expansion of the asset purchase
program and additional longer-term liquidity support for banks. Domestically, a firm commitment to
complete the reform agenda and to reduce the level of sovereign debt through continued fiscal
consolidation would help anchor market confidence.

The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is
meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a
probability of 30 percent or more). See Risk Assessment Matrix (Table 3) for further discussion of risks and methodology.

8.
In this context, a key risk is a reversal of past reforms. Such a reversal would create
uncertainty and could hamper the recovery, especially if the external environment were to
deteriorate significantly. On the external side, other important risks are weaker than expected
demand and inflation in the euro area and a sharp asset price adjustment and decompression of
credit spreads (see Appendix II for the full Risk Assessment Matrix).

Authorities’ view
9.
The authorities have higher forecasts for medium-term growth while agreeing that
remaining vulnerabilities and structural issues require attention. They broadly shared staff’s
view about the short-term outlook and risks and stressed that high growth and progress achieved in
the correction of imbalances offered important protection against a possible deterioration of the
external environment. In this context, they emphasized the role played by past reforms in explaining
the strong economic rebound and the progress already made in reducing domestic imbalances,
especially with regard to public finances, private sector deleveraging, the financial sector, and
employment. They expect higher growth in the medium term as the output gap is still large, but
agreed that there was still significant scope to improve Spain’s long-term growth potential. They
considered that external imbalances have already been reduced amid structural competitiveness
improvements, and pointed out that, unlike in previous recoveries, higher GDP growth rates have
been accompanied by current account surpluses. At the same time, they recognized the need for
further competitiveness gains.

POLICY AGENDA
10.
Sustaining the current high levels of growth over the medium term and reducing
vulnerabilities requires additional policy efforts. Spain has rebounded strongly and employment
is increasing. However, the level of unemployment is still painfully high and domestic and external
vulnerabilities remain. Sustaining job-rich, inclusive growth at the current pace, transitioning to a

ensuring wages reflect differing business conditions across firms, and strengthening the skills of
the long-term unemployed will enhance prospects for higher and more inclusive growth.


Enhancing small firm growth. Removing obstacles for Spain’s many small firms to grow will allow
them to scale up both domestically and externally, and raise productivity.



Facilitating private debt reduction. Further reducing firm and household debt will support
investment and growth going forward. Continued strengthening of banks will ensure they
support growth as credit demand recovers.



Anchoring confidence. Continued gradual and growth-friendly fiscal consolidation, well
coordinated across all levels of governments, will help maintain strong market confidence.

A. Further Strengthening Labor Market Performance
11.
The labor market reforms are helping, but unemployment remains very high. The 2012
reforms increased room for workers and firms to adjust wages and hours worked, and staff analysis
suggests that this helped protect

job. Moreover, about 60 percent of the
unemployed have been jobless for over a year, many of them low-skilled, and risks of poverty and
social exclusion have been rising with the level of unemployment since the crisis.
12.
Despite the reforms, wage dynamics still do not adequately reflect differences in
business conditions across firms. Not enough firms are yet making use of the flexibility clauses
introduced by the reforms to deviate from sector-level wage agreements. This reflects, among other
things, administrative and legal costs to firm-level wage agreements, and uncertainties over the
abolishment of the automatic extension of expiring collective wage agreements (ultra-activity),
where recent court decision could limit firm-level adjustment going forward. As a result, it remains
difficult for the labor market to adjust to variations in sectoral or regional demand. This also reduces

2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SPAIN

the incentives for workers and capital to move from low- to high-productivity firms, including in the
tradables sector, which slows Spain’s much needed adjustment towards a model of faster and more
export-oriented growth.
13.
Labor market duality remains high. Measures to reduce duality, including statutory
limitations on the use of temporary contracts and hiring subsidies for new permanent workers—
which were modified earlier this year to benefit low-income earners more—appear to have
contributed to a pickup in employment based on permanent contracts. However, after dropping
sharply during the recession, the share of temporary jobs in overall employment has remained fairly
steady at around 25 percent, still among the highest among European peers. Such high duality in
the labor market exacerbates downward wage rigidity, lowers workers’ productivity, and
concentrates the burden of market adjustment on those temporarily employed.
14.
This suggests there is still significant scope for measures that will foster high-quality
job creation. Further action in this direction will help reduce unemployment and, thereby, raise
Spain’s longer-term potential for inclusive growth. Steps toward this goal include the following:


Setting the right labor market conditions. Keeping wage growth in line with developments in
productivity and external competitiveness is key for promoting strong and sustainable
employment growth in the medium-term.



Promoting firm-level adjustment. Making sure that wage dynamics reflect differences in firmand sector-specific conditions will boost aggregate productivity and income. To this end, it is
important that the existing options for firm-level adjustment are used as needed, and that
remaining obstacles to firm-level wage bargaining and opt-out, particularly for small firms, are
removed.



Lowering duality. The new incentives for permanent hires are better targeted but temporary in
nature. At the same time, the cost of dismissing a permanent worker is still materially higher
than that for a temporary one. This gap should be closed, for example by introducing a single
contract with tenure-based dismissal costs in sectors without high seasonal turnover.
Alternatively, other approaches could be considered—for example, uniformly financing dismissal
costs through regular employer contributions to a common fund so that workers are adequately
protected and employers’ hiring decision are not distorted toward excessive reliance on
temporary contracts. Finally, reducing legal and administrative uncertainties in collective
dismissals and streamlining the application of objective criteria for fair dismissals would also
help support permanent hiring.



Making Active Labor Market Policies count. The recent measures to improve the skills of the longterm unemployed and low-skill youth are important. However, to be effective these programs
need to be closely monitored, evaluated, and, if needed, fine-tuned, starting with the more
transparent use of regional coverage and enforcement data. Steps to increase the effectiveness
of public and private job-placement agencies also deserve consideration.

Authorities’ view
15.
The authorities broadly agreed with the assessment of the impact of labor market
reforms and most of the remaining challenges. They stressed that the reforms have been a
crucial driver of the Spanish recovery and the pickup in employment. They shared the view that firm
and sector-level adjustment should improve further and suggested that, given the significant scope
of recent reforms, more time is needed for the social partners to adapt to the new rules before
considering additional measures. The authorities recognized that duality is still a problem but noted
that the solutions to address it are complex.

B. Boosting Small Firm Growth
16.
Productivity growth is fundamentally weak, partly reflecting the dominance of small
firms. Spanish firms tend to be more numerous, smaller, less productive, innovative, and exportoriented than those of most European peers. Firms with fewer than 50 workers employ nearly two
thirds of the labor force while generating only about half of the value added in the economy. At the
same time, the productivity gap between small and large companies is wider than in many other
European countries. Staff analysis suggests that, for example, lowering the share of small firms to
match that of Germany and closing the productivity gap between small and large firms to German
levels could raise the level of aggregate total factor productivity (TFP) by as much as 9 percent, with
most of the improvement coming from the reallocation of employment between firms.3
17.
A number of obstacles prevent firms from expanding to exploit economies of scale.
Staff analysis shows substantial variation of TFP across firms’ size, sector, and region. This regional
heterogeneity could point to market fragmentation from the proliferation of regulatory
requirements and practices (such as permits and standards) at the regional and local level, which
constitute barriers to entry and inhibit competition. Other obstacles to growth include sizedependent thresholds in regulation (e.g., in reporting, auditing, and labor-related regulation) and
taxation, as well as limited financing access (Figure 6).
18.
Creating the conditions for small- and medium-size enterprises (SME) to grow is
critical. A number of measures can help generate crucial economies of scale, both in domestic and
external markets. Exploiting these would increase productivity, long-term growth, and employment.


Fostering competition. Fast and effective implementation of the Market Unity Law and moving
ahead with the long-delayed liberalization of professional services would facilitate market entry
and allocation of resources to their most productive uses.



Lowering constraints. The recent corporate tax reform is set to reduce fiscal disincentives for
companies to expand. However, a careful review and assessment of all size-related rules and
regulations is needed to identify and eliminate other unwarranted obstacles to growth.

Supporting exports. While the number of exporting
firms has increased significantly since the crisis, the
degree of internationalization of SMEs is still
relatively low. Against this background, the
government strategy for boosting
internationalization could do more to help SMEs
enter export markets and remain competitive, for
example by helping reduce the high fixed costs of
exporting—including market penetration and other
trade costs, and fostering innovation.

In this context, efforts to strengthen smaller
firms’ access to finance are still important. While bank lending will remain dominant, efforts to
increase market-based financing for SMEs, including via alternative exchanges, venture capital, and
securitization should continue. The accuracy of financial reporting and transparency could be
increased, for example by incorporating consolidated financial information of SMEs in the
centralized database and register. For the financing of new firms, the ongoing program providing
guarantees and direct financing through ICO, a state-owned financial institution, remains highly
relevant and could be complemented by European efforts (including by guarantees extended under
the Juncker plan), while making sure they support all SMEs lacking market access.

Authorities’ view
20.
The authorities agreed on the need to help firms grow and stressed recent progress in
this area. They noted that the implementation of the Market Unity Law is ongoing and that
differences in regulatory norms and practices across Spain, which among other factors limit firm
growth, are being addressed. They emphasized the link between firm size and export orientation,
pointing out that, despite recent advances, additional efforts are necessary to support the
internationalization of Spanish SMEs.

C. Further Strengthening Banks While Reducing Debt
21.

Banking system indicators have improved in the last year:



Banks’ asset quality and specific provisioning have strengthened. The domestic non-performing
loans (NPL) ratio fell to 12.1 percent at end-March 2015 from 13.4 percent one year earlier, while
provisions rose to 57 percent of NPLs—significantly above the euro area average (Figure 7).



Banks have increased nominal capital, mostly through reinvested earnings and equity issuance.
The phased-in Basel III CET1 capital ratio of the system has increased, reaching 11.8 percent
(ranging between 9.7 and 12.7 in the case of the 10 largest banks), comfortably above the
minimum regulatory levels. Spain’s large banks are on track to complete the fully-loaded Basel
III capital schedule on schedule—or ahead of time in case of the two systemically important
financial institutions (SIFIs), which are benefiting from globally-diversified earnings.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

SPAIN



Funding conditions have become more favorable, supported by the ECB’s Targeted Longer-Term
Refinancing Operations (TLTROs) and lower market financing costs, although resident deposits
declined moderately mainly due to a shift to higher yielding instruments.



Liquidity has also improved, with Spanish banks now fully complying with the phased-in
requirement of 60 percent for the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR).



The profitability of the banking system has increased reflecting lower provisioning costs due to
improved asset quality, stronger net interest margins, as deposit rates declined more rapidly
than lending rates, and mark-to-market gains on holdings of government bonds linked to the
ECB’s purchase program.



Banking sector efficiency has continued to strengthen. Spanish banks lowered operating coststo-income by 1.5 percentage points (to 49 percent) at end-2014, which compares favorably with
peers in large euro area economies. Efficiency gains have followed significant consolidation of
the banking sector during 2012–14, with the number of commercial banks falling from 50 to 15.

22.
Progress towards the banking union continues. The Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM)
now directly supervises Spain’s larger banks, representing more than 90 percent of the assets in the
banking system. The transposition of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) in Spain,
approved in June 2015, constitutes an important step in implementing an effective European
resolution framework. The law established a two-tier setup, with the Bank of Spain being responsible
for pre-resolution tasks and the national bank resolution fund (FROB) responsible for all resolution
functions in the execution phase. The European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) has noted that further
progress is needed to bring the macroprudential framework in line with its recommendations.
23.
Against this background and with the outlook improving, the ongoing deleveraging
process has become more selective. The overall level of credit in the economy is still declining but
the pace has slowed from around -10 percent at end-2013 to -5 percent year-on-year in April 2015,
and it is expected to turn positive by the end of this year. Meanwhile, new credit is being extended,

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SPAIN

especially to non-financial corporations outside real estate and construction with healthy financial
positions. New household credit is also growing. The improved credit outlook is mostly demand
driven. In the meantime, the process of dealing with the public legacy of the financial crisis
continues (see Box 3).
24.
However, banks still face challenging operating conditions. Upcoming international
regulations on fully-loaded Basel III capital, total loss-absorbing capital (TLAC), and minimum
requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) will likely demand additional lossabsorbing capacity, including capital, for most banks. A change in the treatment of deferred tax
assets (DTAs) might require additional capital buffers for some banks. A prolonged low-interest rate
environment in the euro area could compress lending margins, while some banks continue to face
significant costs from foreclosed assets and high levels of NPLs. In this context, pressures to cut
operational costs are likely to persist.
25.
Continued strengthening of the Spanish banking sector will support growth as credit
demand picks up. It remains important to further encourage banks to increase high-quality capital
(e.g., through equity and restraint on dividends and bonuses) and reduce the carrying costs (e.g., for
administration, capital, and funding charges) associated with high levels of NPLs. This will ensure
more favorable credit conditions for financially-sound households and corporates, and make it less
likely that credit growth will be constrained by supply as the recovery matures.
26.
The recent insolvency reforms are significant steps to help facilitate private sector
deleveraging. Consistent with previous staff recommendations, in early 2015 Spain introduced a
“fresh start” for individual entrepreneurs and consumers. The new mechanism allows for a
conditional discharge of individuals’ residual debt after liquidation of assets in bankruptcy. This
could encourage liquidation of nonviable businesses whose debt is inseparable from that of
individuals (e.g., sole proprietorships) and help households reduce debt to sustainable levels. Other
reforms include amendments to the out-of-court restructuring mechanism for SMEs and the
restructuring and liquidation procedures within insolvency to facilitate restructuring of viable firms
and the sale of businesses as going concerns.
27.
Implemented effectively, the “fresh start” can encourage demand and entrepreneurial
activity in the formal sector, while preserving Spain’s strong payment culture. Staff analysis
suggests that this could potentially reduce the stock of household debt by around 3–4 percent and
the level of corporate debt by about 1–2 percent relative to the baseline, which would contribute to
higher private consumption and investment (Box 1).4 At the same time, the negative effects on bank
earnings are estimated to be limited. Correspondingly, banks are unlikely to face significant impact
on their ability to extend credit.

See fourth chapter of Selected Issues Papers.

28.

However, there are critical challenges related to implementation, including:



Achieving the greatest possible clarity regarding the post-liquidation payment plan and
conditions that would lead to a revocation of the fresh start would reduce uncertainty for
debtors and limit potential for abuse, ultimately maximizing the positive effects of the reform.



The inclusion of public creditors—fully involving them in all restructuring processes of the
insolvency regime and making at least those public claims considered ordinary (i.e., 50 percent
of tax and social security claims) subject to discharge after liquidation—would increase the
effectiveness of the system and avoid creating incentives for debtors to strategically prioritize
payments to public creditors at the expense of private ones, with negative effect on payment
culture.



Staff estimates that the possible immediate impact on the public sector will likely be small, and it
could be positive in the longer term if formal-sector activity increases.

Authorities’ view
29.
There was broad agreement on the assessment of banks. The authorities stressed the
progress made in dealing with crisis legacies and the continued strengthening of the banking
system in terms of capital ratios, profitability, asset quality, funding and liquidity conditions, while
acknowledging the challenges coming from a prolonged low interest rate environment and new
regulatory issues, including the prospects for higher international loss-absorbency requirements in
the coming years.
30.
The authorities also generally concurred with staff’s views on the reforms to the
insolvency regime. They agreed with the need to clarify certain key elements in the “fresh start”
reform, and pointed out that Parliament has already approved amendments to do so. While taking
note of staff’s concerns regarding the exclusion of public creditors, they did not consider that this
would limit the reform’s effect, and pointed to potential fiscal repercussions of excusing even
bankrupt firms from their obligations to the public sector and the harmful impact on the current tax
deferment policy. The authorities broadly agreed that the short-term impact of the recent insolvency
reforms on banks’ earnings was likely to be limited while stressing that the effects on Spain’s strong
payment culture deserved careful monitoring.

D. Ensuring a Coordinated and Credible Fiscal Consolidation
31.
Deficit reduction is continuing, supported by higher growth and lower interest rates,
but public debt is close to 100 percent of GDP and still increasing. Deficit reduction over the last
four years has been critical for underpinning confidence. However, the pace of consolidation has
slowed and is stalling this year in structural terms, although significant tailwinds from higher than
expected nominal growth and relatively low interest rates are helping to meet the 2015 deficit target
of 4.2 percent (Figure 8). Bringing the headline deficit below 3 percent to exit the Excessive Deficit
Procedure (EDP) in 2016 and reaching structural balance in 2020 in line with European Union and

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SPAIN

national rules will be challenging. One reason is that measures specified so far fall short of the
required structural adjustment.
32.
Fiscal risks at the regional level are particularly high.5 The contribution of regional
governments to post-crisis consolidation has been significant, helped by reforms in fiscal
governance—in particular the adoption of Spain’s Budget Stability Law (BSL) in 2012 and
subsequent improvements in regional budget practices and fiscal transparency. However, fiscal
efforts have been uneven across regions and the overall regional target has been systematically
missed, threatening to undermine the credibility of the overall consolidation effort going forward
(Figure 9). Regional liquidity mechanisms in the form of conditional loans at low interest rates from
the central government have helped regions but also raised moral hazard risks.

At the regional level, there is scope for additional
efficiency gains and fiscal savings—for example, by reducing the costs of providing public health
and education services and, as recommended by the Tax Reform Expert Committee last year, by
increasing the regions’ regulatory power to establish copayments for these services. To maintain
access and affordability of public education and health services, copayments could be reduced

or eliminated for vulnerable groups on the basis of means testing as well as for specific health
services (e.g., chronic diseases, preventive care, and immunization).
34.
Further improving the regional fiscal framework would help with these efforts. While
post-crisis reforms have strengthened regional fiscal autonomy and governance, there is scope for
further advances:


The monitoring and enforcement of regional fiscal targets, rules, and access to regional liquidity
mechanisms under the BSL and related instruments could be enhanced. This could be achieved,
for example, by introducing pre-agreed intra-year targets and corrective measures, stressing
regional best budgeting practices, and improving the responsiveness to the independent fiscal
council’s recommendations.



Risk sharing and discipline could be rebalanced. Consideration could be given to strengthening
the conditionality of existing regional liquidity mechanisms (for example, by making access to all
mechanisms conditional to the approval of an adjustment plan and disbursements to
compliance with intra-year fiscal targets under this plan) or by adding new conditional credit
facilities to help finance regions in bad times (e.g., tax-based rainy day funds).



Fiscal equalization and settlement procedures under the current regional finance system could be
improved. A more effective way of equalizing the regions’ resources to meet their spending
needs would increase their capacity to reach their fiscal targets. Reviewing the rules determining
how intergovernmental transfers are advanced and settled would reinforce their incentives to
follow through with fiscal adjustment.



Consideration could also be given to allowing regions’ fiscal targets to differ—in a rules-based and
transparent fashion—taking into account structural differences in adjustment needs and
capacity.

Authorities’ view
35.
The authorities are confident that they can achieve the deficit targets. The planned
reduction in the headline deficit this year and next is supported by the strong economic recovery,
lower interest rates, and the measures envisaged under the Stability Program. They stressed that the
BSL and, in particular, the expenditure rule should help ensure regional fiscal targets are met. They
saw public debt on a clear downward path and argued that historical sustainability scenarios based
on an extraordinary difficult period including the recent crisis period could be misleading.
36.
The authorities broadly agreed with the need to strengthen the regional financing
system. They saw merit in a review of the financing system of the regions pointing out the
complexity of the issue. They felt that monitoring and enforcement rules under the BSL have
supported achieving general government deficit targets and that the conditionality requirements
under existing regional financing mechanisms are sufficient to mitigate moral hazard risks.

STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
Spain’s recovery has accelerated. Stronger confidence is supporting the rebound of
domestic demand, aided by the ECB’s expansionary policies and external tailwinds. Employment is
growing, even though, at more than 5 million people, unemployment remains painfully high.
38.
Past reforms and strong policy implementation are contributing to the recovery. Labor
market reforms and moderate wage growth, the Market Unity Law, financial sector reform, and
continued fiscal consolidation have reassured financial markets and underpinned confidence.
39.
However, it will take additional efforts to sustain growth at current levels. In the
medium term, the expansion is constrained by still sizable public and private debt overhangs that
are weighing on consumption and investment and deep structural problems, including high
structural unemployment and the notoriously low productivity of Spain’s many small firms.
40.
There is still significant room for improving labor market performance. Keeping
aggregate wage increases in line with productivity and competitiveness while allowing firm-level
wages to better reflect business conditions will promote job-rich growth and encourage resources
to move to more productive and export oriented sectors. Reducing duality and implementing more
effective active labor market policies would improve skills and help the long-term unemployed find
work.
41.
Reducing obstacles for small firms to grow can unlock productivity. Accelerating the
implementation of the Market Unity Law and opening up professional services would foster market
entry and competition. A careful review of size-related rules and regulations, supporting SME
internationalization, and further developing access to finance would allow firms to scale up and
significantly improve Spain’s growth potential.
42.
Further strengthening banks will support growth as credit demand recovers. The ECB’s
comprehensive assessment confirmed the much stronger position of the banking system, but
operating conditions remain challenging. This calls for continuing to build high-quality capital and
reducing the carrying costs of high NPLs.
43.
The “fresh start” reform facilitates private sector deleveraging. Implemented effectively,
it can boost demand and future entrepreneurial activity while protecting Spain’s strong payment
culture. Fully involving public creditors would add to the impact of the reform.
44.
Credible, coordinated, and growth-friendly fiscal consolidation needs to continue. The
deficit has been declining, but consolidation efforts have slowed. A pace of structural adjustment of
around ½ percent of GDP per year should be ensured to put debt on a firmly declining path. Any
windfalls from lower interest rates and higher-than-expected growth should be saved. Additional
measures will be required at all government levels to achieve EDP and Medium-Term Budgetary
Objective (MTO) targets. These should be implemented in such a manner as to protect the
vulnerable.

45.
The regional fiscal framework can be strengthened further. Regions contributed
significantly but unevenly to post-crisis consolidation. To reduce implementation risks, monitoring
and enforcement of fiscal targets and access to regional liquidity mechanisms could be improved
and design drawbacks in the regional finance system addressed, including by allowing fiscal targets
to vary in line with adjustment needs and capacities.

Box 1. Household Deleveraging and Growth
What are the implications of household debt deleveraging for private savings and consumption
dynamics? Private consumption has rebounded recently and there is much upside potential. The level of
consumption is still 11 percent below its 2007 peak and lagging GDP, which has recovered to about
7½ percent below the pre-crisis peak. The household savings ratio has declined to 9.7 percent in 2014 and
could, in principle, fall further. However, the savings rate is already well below its 2000–14 average of
10.6 percent and, at 109 percent of disposable income, Spanish household debt is still high—both in
historical and international comparison.

Household savings decisions will also be affected by the need to rebuild assets and wealth. Household
wealth has declined substantially since the pre-crisis peak. While the household debt-to-disposable income
ratio dropped by 25 percentage points since 2007, household wealth-to-disposable income fell by nearly
30 percent, with house wealth, the bulk of household assets, losing about a third of its value since 2007.
Empirical evidence suggests that households’ debt and asset position have had a major influence on
consumption in Spain and elsewhere since the crisis.

Simulations illustrate the link between deleveraging, asset accumulation, and household savings. In a
baseline scenario, households reduce their gross debt/GDI ratio to its 2004 level within 20 years while house
prices are assumed to rise such that the gross asset/GDI ratio improves by 3¼ percent by 2020. With GDI
growing at 3½ percent per annum over 2015–20, on average, this would require an increase in household
saving ratio from current levels to slightly below the long run historical average. However, achieving the
same deleveraging target in just 10 years would require higher savings of ½ percentage point of GDI per
year, on average, compared to the baseline (scenario 1). An even more ambitious strategy to rebuild

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SPAIN

Box 1. Household Deleveraging and Growth (concluded)
household net wealth by achieving the same deleveraging target in 10 years, while maintaining a constant
share of financial assets-to-GDI would require higher savings of 1¼ percentage points of GDI per year, on
average, compared to the baseline (scenario 2). If implemented effectively, the recent insolvency reforms,
allowing for a “fresh start” for individual entrepreneurs and consumers, could facilitate a decline in
household debt and reduce savings. Depending on the speed at which the reform’s effects unfold, it could
lower savings by up to a ½ to a third of a percentage point of GDI per year, on average, over a 10 to 20 year
period, respectively. This, for example, would at least partially offset the hypothetical increase in the savings
ratio vis-à-vis the baseline modeled in scenario 1.
The alternative scenarios would imply lower household
consumption than under the baseline, but the effects on
aggregate demand depend on the circumstances. For
example, aggregate demand would remain unchanged if
the higher household savings would finance higher netexports or be channeled into higher investment, with
possible benefits for potential growth going forward.
Conversely, to the extent that these additional savings
would be used to pay down existing external debt and to
lower the very high negative NIIP (see fifth chapter of
Selected Issues Papers), aggregate demand would be lower.

Note: Baseline assumes a return of the gross debt to gross domestic income (GDI) ratio
to its 2004 level within 20 years; and an improvement in house prices of 3 percent of
GDI by 2020. Scenario 1 achieves the same debt deleveraging in only 10 years, while
Scenario 2, in addition, assumes that the financial asset to GDI ratio is brought back to
its 2006 level in 6 years.

Box 2. Potential Output Growth in Spain: What Is the Scope for Improvement?
Potential growth slowed significantly since the global
financial crisis. Multivariate filter-based estimates suggest
a drop from about 3 percent in 1995–2007 to around
¾ percent since 2008.1 The crisis led to a sharp fall in
investment, with balance sheets effects aggravating the
impact of weak demand.2 Unemployment rose rapidly,
leading to an increase in long-term and structural
unemployment. Empirical measures of TFP have shown
some improvement relative to the very low levels in the
past, and this has been linked mostly to the exit of lowproductivity firms and the drastic labor shedding, especially
of relatively lower-skilled temporary workers, during the crisis.

Absent additional reforms, potential growth is expected to remain low. Staff estimates place potential
growth at well under 1½ percent per year on average 2015–20. This reflects the expectation that capital
accumulation is likely to remain subdued as firm balance sheet constraints would still weigh on investment,
adverse population dynamics, and persistent structural unemployment at around 16 percent. In addition,
TFP growth is expected to remain low, reflecting the continued dominance of small firms and labor market

duality, which lowers incentives to invest in workers’ skills.

respectively.3 Tackling duality, addressing skills deficiencies,
and other reforms that would lower structural unemployment to about 10 percent would lift potential
output by an estimated additional 4 percent. Joint implementation within a 10 year time frame would result
in potential annual growth of about 2½ percent, almost double the rate currently expected under the
baseline.

Box 3. Public Stakes in the Financial Sector
Spain’s bank resolution fund, FROB, is making progress in the sale of public stakes in the financial
sector, but remaining divestments appear more challenging in the near term. Since 2009, FROB
provided €53.5 billion of public support to banks in the form of equity stakes. In 2014, the fund sold its
holdings in NCG Banco and Catalunya Banc, as well as a 7.5 percent stake in Bankia, resulting in about
€3.5 billion of revenue over a number of years as payments are being received in installments. Buyers of
banking stakes have been mainly domestic banks, while portfolios have been acquired by private equity
funds. Selling the two remaining stakes (in Bankia and BMN), worth about €11 billion, ahead of the end-2017
and early-2018 deadlines could be more difficult. Although these banks’ earnings have increased, their share
price valuations remain below target sale prices, in part due to potential concerns about a large share of
deferred tax assets (DTAs) in capital. The FROB also maintains a 45 percent equity stake in SAREB, Spain’s
Asset Management Company, amounting to approximately €½ billion, which is expected to be divested by
2027.
SAREB has continued to face losses. Losses amounted to €0.3 billion in 2013 and €0.6 billion in 2014,
mainly owing to optimistic valuations of the assets transferred—even though the real estate market has now
stabilized after a roughly 40 percent decline. The original portfolio (€50.7 billion) has been reduced by
almost 15 percent, broadly in line with the targeted 15-year unwinding schedule. The business plan has
recently been updated to reflect more realistic assumptions and SAREB has also hired 4 investment
companies, including distressed debt funds, as servicing companies, to manage the cash flow and sales of
the bulk of its portfolio assets.

rate

Background. Since mid-2012, financing conditions have greatly eased, with sovereign bond yields near historical lows,
non-resident portfolio inflows have resumed, and ECB borrowing has fallen significantly.
Assessment. The ECB’s actions as well as domestic reform progress have greatly helped improve investor sentiment.
However, large external financing needs both in the public and private sector leave Spain vulnerable to sudden changes
in market sentiment and spillovers from Europe.
Background. The euro has the status of a global reserve currency.
Assessment. Reserves held by the euro area are typically low relative to standard metrics, but the currency is free
floating.

Overall Assessment:
The external position in 2014 was
substantially weaker than that consistent
with medium-term fundamentals and
desirable policy settings.
As of May 2015, the impact of lower oil
import prices and REER depreciation is
broadly offset by strong domestic demand
growth. However, these recent
developments do not change the overall
assessment.
In particular, despite the strong
improvement in the current account since
the pre-crisis peak deficit in 2007,
achieving both a sufficiently declining IIP
and much lower unemployment would
require a substantially weaker real effective
exchange rate.
Potential policy responses:
The authorities’ recent reforms and policy
plans to deliver gradual fiscal
consolidation, further improve active labor
market policies, foster corporate and
household debt restructuring, and to
advance product market reforms, are in
line with reducing imbalances.
A more ambitious fiscal adjustment would
lead to a faster improvement of the current
account. In the medium term, further
structural reforms of the labor market and
accelerated implementation of product
market reforms would be required to
speed the adjustment.
Continued monetary easing at the euro
area level—motivated by the need to raise
the prospects of achieving the ECB’s price
stability objective and to support demand,
given the weak and fragile growth, large
output gaps and very low inflation for the
euro area as a whole—would also support
Spain’s adjustment efforts.

Background. The net international investment position (NIIP) liabilities dropped from -34 percent of GDP in 2000
to -91 percent of GDP in 2009, driven mainly by substantial current account (CA) deficits but also reflecting valuation
effects. The current account improved subsequently, but the NIIP remains elevated at -93 percent at end-2014. High
gross external debt has stabilized around 160 percent of GDP.
Assessment. The large negative NIIP comes with external vulnerabilities, including from valuation changes and the
large gross financing needs from external debt. Mitigating factors are a favorable maturity structure of Spain’s
outstanding sovereign debt with an average of 6 ½ years and current ECB measures such as QE.
Background. With imports accelerating along with the recovery, the CA declined to a 0.8 percent of GDP surplus in
2014 (or -0.5 percent of GDP cyclically adjusted) after a 1.4 percent surplus in 2013 and a peak deficit in 2007 of
10 percent of GDP. Since 2014, the sharply lower oil price helped reduce overall import costs, partly offsetting higher
import growth following the surge in domestic demand. The depreciation of the euro positively contributed to Spain’s
exports outside the Euro zone, while ECB measures have helped to drive down interest rates on external debt.
Assessment. Although the EBA model-based estimates of current account norms would suggest a balanced CA for
2014 (0 percent of GDP), the staff assessment considers the overriding need to sharply improve the NIIP and gauges
the 2014 cyclically-adjusted CA to have been 0.5-2.5 percent of GDP weaker than desirable. Surpluses of this magnitude
will need to be maintained until the NIIP is at safer and sustainable levels. Under staff’s current forecast, a gradually
improving current account will improve the IIP by about 3-4 percent of GDP annually in the medium term. To the extent
the output gap is larger, for example, reflecting a structural level of unemployment closer to international peers, the
cyclically-adjusted current account would be lower and thus the gap with respect to the desirable level larger.
Background. By 2014, the CPI-based real effective exchange rate (REER) had declined by 1 percent from its 2013 level,
and by 3 percent from its 2008 peak, only a limited reversal of the almost 12 percent appreciation since euro entry. The
ULC-based REER, however, shows the appreciation has been substantially reversed since that time, largely reflecting
substantial labor shedding. Export market shares have been resilient. Recently, as of May 2015, the REER has
depreciated by 5 percent from its 2014 average.
Assessment. The two EBA REER regression model approaches, the “index” and “level” REER tools, estimate an
overvaluation of 13.3 and 10.3 percent for 2014, respectively (with reference to the CPI-based REER); a historical REER
(CPI and ULC based) and other model-based analysis, including taking into consideration IIP sustainability, suggest the
overvaluation may be smaller. On balance, staff assesses a 2014 gap of around 5 to 10 percent above the level
consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. However, as for the current account analysis,
achieving significantly lower unemployment rates closer to international peers in the medium term would likely imply a
larger gap.

relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent,
“medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall
level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Appendix III. Spain: Debt Sustainability Analysis
Public debt sustainability risks remain significant, despite the reduction of the fiscal deficit over the
last four years. Under the baseline scenario, public debt is projected to peak at 98.5 percent of GDP
in 2016 before declining to 93.9 percent in 2020. This is a result of fiscal efforts to bring the deficit to
3 percent of GDP and exit the EDP in 2016, higher growth, and lower interest rates. Beyond 2016,
fiscal adjustment - to the tune of ½ percent of GDP per year - would be needed to make sure that
public debt will be on a firmly declining path and to reduce sovereign vulnerabilities, in particular to
growth, fiscal adjustment and contingent liabilities shocks. While still above early warning
benchmarks, gross financing needs are expected to decline to 16.2 percent of GDP in the medium
term, reflecting lower headline deficits and fairly long term maturity structure of public debt.

A.

Background



Public debt comprises Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) debt in hands of the General
Government.



The General Government includes the Central Government, Regional Governments, Local
Government, and Social Security Funds. It does not include public enterprises.



EDP debt is a subset of General Government consolidated debt (i.e., it does not include trade
credits and other accounts payable) and the stocks are recorded at their nominal value.



The public debt-to-GDP ratio increased from 35.5 percent of GDP in 2007 to
97.7 percent in 2014, driven by large fiscal deficits.



The composition of public debt is tilted towards long-term debt (81 percent of the total) in a
similar proportion to the one that existed before the crisis. The fraction of public debt in hands
of domestic residents increased from 52.2 percent in 2007 to 58.8 in 2014.

B.

Baseline



Debt is projected to continue increasing and peak at 98.5 percent of GDP in 2016, before
declining to 93.9 percent by 2020.



The main assumptions underlying the baseline reflect the current WEO forecast, including: (i) a
gradual fiscal consolidation in 2015–16 to reduce the deficit to 3 percent of GDP, needed to exit
the EDP, followed by a slowdown in fiscal efforts beyond 2016; (ii) stronger growth for this and
next year, but somewhat slower medium term growth reflecting still sizeable debt overhangs,
low productivity, and high unemployment, and (iii) effective interest rate estimates factor in
lower marginal interest rates for this year and next due to the ECB’s QE, and a gradual increase
thereafter, reflecting higher inflation in the medium term. Nevertheless, the effective rate is
projected to remain fairly stable despite the increase in marginal costs, given that the average
maturity is assumed to remain fairly long (6½ years, on average).

Stress Tests



Primary balance shock. The primary balance in 2016-17 is hit by a shock equal to
2.5 percent of GDP (50 percent of the 10-year historical standard deviation of the primary
balance-to-GDP ratio). The debt/GDP ratio peaks at 103.1 percent of GDP in 2017 and then
gradually declines to 99.1 percent in 2020, about 5.2 percentage points higher compared to
baseline debt in 2020.



Growth shock. Real GDP growth rates are 2.7 percent lower in 2016–17 (100 percent of the
10-year historical standard deviation of real GDP growth rates). The debt-to-GDP ratio peaks at
108.5 in 2017 and then declines gradually to 104.4 percent in 2020 (10.4 percentage points
higher than the baseline).



Interest rate shock. Nominal interest rates increase by about 200 basis points during
2016–20. The effective interest rate increases to 3.7 percent by 2020 compared to 2.8 percent in
the baseline. The debt-to-GDP ratio peaks at close to 99 percent in 2016 and then gradually falls
to 96.1 percent in 2020 (2.2 percentage points higher than the baseline).



Combined shock. A simultaneous combination of the previous three shocks would result in an
increasing debt-to-GDP ratio that peaks at 110.1 percent in 2017 and then declines gradually to
107.9 percent in 2020 (14 percentage points higher than the baseline).



Contingent liability shock. A one-time increase in non-interest expenditures equivalent in 2016
to 10 percent of banking sector assets combined with lower growth and lower inflation in 2016–
17 (i.e., growth is reduced by 1 standard deviation) results in debt-to-GDP ratio peaking at
115.5 percent in 2017, followed by a gradual decline to 111.7 percent in 2020 (17.8 percentage
points higher than the baseline).

1/ Public sector is defined as general government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over German bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Statement by the Staff Representative on the Spain
Executive Board Meeting
July 27, 2015
This statement updates information in the staff report without altering the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
The situation in Greece has been evolving rapidly. Since the issuance of the staff report, the
Greek parliament passed a package of reforms as the basis for starting negotiations on a new
ESM program. National parliaments in several euro area countries have endorsed these
reforms. Market developments in the euro area have been broadly positive. Spanish
sovereign bond yields and spreads relative to the German Bund have declined, while equity
prices, especially bank stocks, have risen.
Nonetheless, further episodes of significant uncertainty and volatility arising from the
situation in Greece cannot be ruled out. As noted in the staff report, these risks can be
mitigated by timely and effective policy measures at the euro area level. In Spain, a clear
commitment to continue structural reforms and to put the level of sovereign debt on a firmly
declining path would help anchor confidence.

Statement by Mr. Jimenez Latorre, Executive Director for Spain,
Ms. Sanchez Rodriguez, Advisor to the Executive Director, and Mr. Lopez, Alternate
Executive Director for Spain
July 27, 2015

After an unprecedented deep and long lasting recession, Spain is now reaping the benefits of a
very ambitious policy agenda. Spain is currently among the fastest growing advanced economies,
with leading employment creation in the Euro area. These very welcome developments are
underpinned by a strong commitment to reforms and fiscal consolidation, which need to be
sustained so as to address the still significant challenges ahead. We thank staff for the candid
dialogue held during the mission and for its hard work, including the seven high quality and well
balanced selected issues papers. We agree with staff’s assessment that “reforms make a
difference” and that their reversal would have a negative economic impact. We also agree with
their many constructive and useful economic policy recommendations, which are in line with the
authorities’ goals.
Correction of macroeconomic imbalances and the improving picture of the Spanish
Economy
The Spanish economy is in a much better position now than three years ago. Confidence has
been restored, and this includes foreign and domestic investors, consumers and entrepreneurs
alike. This improvement stems from the correction of macroeconomic flow imbalances, which
has played a major role in the change of perception towards the Spanish economy:
-

Spain has regained the competitiveness lost after joining the euro vis-à-vis main trading
partners through a sizable internal devaluation process. Unit labor costs have come down
substantially, and other relative competitiveness indicators, such as CPIs or REERs, are
also showing important gains. Alongside with demand compression, there has been a
major structural reallocation of production towards the external market: the export sector
is thriving, with exports now accounting for 32 percent of GDP vs. 23 percent of GDP in
2009.

-

The sheer size of the adjustment in the current account surplus, over 11 points in 5 years,
is unprecedented by historical standards for an advanced large non-commodity exporting
economy, as staff rightly acknowledged in last year’s Art. IV consultation. Spain has
been running a current account surplus since 2013; and, more importantly, this surplus is
expected to be maintained over the coming years despite a fast growing domestic demand
environment, which signals the structural nature of the adjustment. This is no lesser feat:
2015 will be the third consecutive year with current account surplus, which is
unprecedented by historical standards.

-

The deleveraging process is ongoing, with significant progress both in the corporate and
household sectors. Private debt has fallen by 38.2 percentage points from its peak, and
household debt as a share of net assets stands at 69.9 percent of GDP, a level last seen in
2006, suggesting that consumption growth could be sustained well into the future. The
analysis of household debt in terms of net assets is very relevant in the case of Spain,
where there is a deep culture of home ownership; the use of this metric should be
promoted within the Fund, as has been the case in other European countries’ Art. IV
consultations, and for the 2015 WEO.

Economic performance is finally reflecting these corrections: output is growing at an annualized
rate of around 4 percent and Spain is profiting from an employment-rich recovery. No analyst or
economic institution envisaged this improvement two years ago. As a matter of fact, in 2013 the
IMF forecasted 0 percent growth for 2014 and 0.3 percent for 2015, as well as negative potential
output, depicting Spain as the example of a stagnant economy saddled by the legacies of the
crisis.
A recovery underpinned by a strong policy agenda
An appropriate fiscal consolidation strategy and an ambitious structural reform program have
underpinned the turnaround of the Spanish economy.
Fiscal consolidation
From its peak, the fiscal deficit is expected to be reduced by 6.6 percentage points of GDP in
nominal terms in 2015, against the backdrop of a severe recession, with a sizable structural
effort. The authorities remain firmly committed to delivering on fiscal targets, bringing down the
fiscal deficit below 3 percent in 2016 and reaching the medium-term objective (MTO) of a
balanced budgetary position in structural terms by 2019.
Structural reforms have also been implemented on the fiscal side: the fiscal framework has been
strengthened under the Budget Stability Law and a new independent fiscal institution is now
operational. Commercial arrears to public sector suppliers have been cleared and efforts have
been made to streamline and increase the efficiency of the public sector, with structural reform
has also had a positive impact on the fiscal consolidation process, putting the Spanish pension
system on a sustainable footing for the future. On the revenue side, progress has been made to
rebalance direct and indirect taxation so as to promote an employment rich recovery.
Structural reforms
The Spanish authorities have forcefully implemented a comprehensive policy agenda to recover
competitiveness and increase the flexibility of the Spanish economy. The 2012 labor market
reform has helped firms navigate difficult economic times while at the same time preventing

labor shedding in the scale seen before the reform. Now that the economy is growing, the reform
has spurred faster job creation and good employment prospects.
Other important reforms include the Market Unity Law, curbing red tape and market
fragmentation; an overhaul of insolvency regulations to facilitate deleveraging and encourage
‘fresh start’ while at the same time preserving payment culture; and a broad range of other
measures to improve SMEs’ financing, corporate governance and competition.
Financial sector and credit
Over the last few years Spain has completed deep and comprehensive reforms in the financial
sector that have included strengthened provisioning requirements and transparency, asset quality
reviews, stress tests, recapitalization and transfer of impaired real estate assets to an asset
management company. These reforms have also encompassed an overhaul of corporate
governance, the savings banks regime, investor protection rules and prudential requirements
(such as a narrower definition of capital and stricter forbearance criteria, to name a few).
As a result of all these efforts, the Spanish banking sector has notably strengthened its situation
in terms of solvency, profitability, asset quality, provisioning, funding and liquidity, as the staff
report acknowledges. Consequently, the Spanish banking system obtained the best result in the
asset quality review, and the second best result in the stress test of the Comprehensive
Assessment run by the ECB in 2014.
The Spanish economy is already reaping the benefits of a sounder financial system in terms of
credit flows and, hence, growth and job creation. Specifically, flows of new credit for SMEs and
households have been positive for the last year and a half, and the overall figure for credit to
non-financial corporations also turned positive at the beginning of 2015.
Non-financial private sector deleveraging is well advanced and has become compatible with new
credit. The aggregate amount of credit is now contracting less sharply than in previous years,
both in terms of lending to households and to non-financial corporations, reflecting both net
amortization of old loans and dynamic creation of new ones. This aspect is extremely positive, as
deleveraging is ongoing while at the same time banks are capable of extending new credit, which
is being allocated to more productive and financially solvent borrowers, therefore increasing the
quality of banks’ assets.
Stock vs. flow adjustment
Despite the significant correction achieved in terms of flows, the Spanish authorities see no room
for complacency, in so far as the adjustment of stocks needs to continue. It should be noted that
correction of stock imbalances, particularly coming from high levels, takes time.

Staff’s report rightly focuses on the importance of correcting stock imbalances, but gives less
attention to the remarkable and historically exceptional ongoing correction of flows that is taking
place in the Spanish economy. As an example, we would have welcomed a mention to
employment creation numbers, a major achievement of the Spanish economy that stems from the
2012 labor market reform: according to data from the first quarter of 2015 around 500,000 new
jobs were created over last year (on seasonally adjusted terms), reducing unemployment by more
than 2 percentage points.
In the same vein, a reference is made to the high level of structural unemployment and the low
level of potential growth. Two years ago the estimate for structural unemployment, at 20 percent,
was almost 4 percentage points higher and, at the same time, potential growth was deemed to be
close to nil, around 1 percentage point both lower than current estimates.
Flow adjustments matter, and they are a precondition for stock adjustments. Lack of attention to
the extraordinarily significant flow adjustments can lead to bias in risk assessment. Staff
concludes that Greek contagion risks on the Spanish economy “remain significant” and could
lead to “renewed sovereign and financial sector stress.” A closer look at the resilience of flow
developments (strong growth, employment creation, external surplus, fiscal prudence) would
suggest otherwise. We would have also welcomed a stronger mention to the reinforcing of euro
institutions, such as the ESM, the banking union or the ECB’s initiatives. Staff’s pessimistic
assessment is also at odds with the assessments contained in the Art. IV report for the Eurozone
as well as in recent Art. IV reports for other Eurozone countries.
External sector
The performance of the external sector has been very positive since the beginning of the crisis.
After many years of demand compression and high unemployment, domestic demand started to
recover last year without a significant deterioration of the current account, which is still in
surplus. Moreover, this recovery of domestic demand has happened in a context of continued
credit contraction and deleveraging, which shows that the recovery is not a return to a creditfuelled absorption boom. Favorable developments of energy prices and the euro have also
contributed to a more positive evolution of the current account.
NIIP has worsened substantially since 2000, mainly driven by sustained current account deficits
during the boom years—which have now been corrected—and, as staff rightly acknowledges, by
substantial valuation effects that are expected to subside. However, there are mitigating factors to
the assessment of the net debtor position, correctly considered in the external sector SIP—
although not mentioned in the body of the report. The NIIP has a large FDI component (20
percent of GDP), and significant large gross equity liabilities and assets (60 percent of GDP).
Debt is in domestic currency in net terms and its maturity is predominantly long term; as for
assets, they are diversified. Both authorities and staff expect the NIIP to improve substantially
over the coming years.

The prospects for the Spanish economy
The Spanish economy has corrected its flow imbalances and stock imbalances have improved
significantly. These corrections attest to the effectiveness of an economic policy agenda based on
fiscal discipline and supply side reforms. However, there is no room for complacency. Spain still
faces significant challenges ahead. The sizable imbalances accumulated prior to the deep and
long lasting recession, together with those created by the economic crisis, cannot be corrected in
a couple of years; the Spanish authorities are convinced that fiscal consolidation and reform
momentum should continue going forward.
