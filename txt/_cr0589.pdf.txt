EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
After a slowdown in 2002, Albania’s macroeconomic performance has been commendable: growth
has been 6 percent in 2003–04 with low inflation, and the lek has appreciated reflecting increasing
confidence. The public debt-to-GDP ratio has fallen from nearly 67 percent at end-2001 to about
55 percent at end-2004, and external liabilities, at 17 percent of GDP, are limited. However, despite a
narrowing of the external deficit, the trade deficit remains wide and the economy is dependent on
transfers from abroad—as a broad-based export-driven expansion has not yet taken root. Thus,
improving competitiveness and attracting investment are key priorities. Performance under the
program since the fourth review has been good and program conditionality was observed, some with
significant margins. The political environment is dominated by the upcoming mid-2005 elections.
Policy discussions focused on maintaining macroeconomic stability, strengthening the monetary,
financial, and budget policy frameworks, and improving the investment climate. The accompanying
Ex Post Assessment was also discussed with the authorities.
●
The outlook is for growth to remain close to its 6 percent trend supported by domestic demand
in the near term, and then increasingly by productivity and external trade gains in the medium term.
However, maintaining this growth pace will require significant improvements in infrastructure and
the business climate, including governance, property rights protection, and the rule of law.
●
The newly appointed management of the Bank of Albania (BoA) reiterated the commitment to
a strong monetary policy framework based on BoA independence, price and financial stability, and a
flexible exchange rate. The monetary stance remains tight, but the current neutral bias is appropriate.
In the wake of the large Savings Bank privatization, the financial sector is showing welcome
dynamism and the BoA is stepping up prudential vigilance. The upcoming FSAP will contribute to
these efforts. Financial intermediation is expanding, helped by the authorities’ initiatives to build
market infrastructure and curtail the use of cash—including by paying public wages through the
banking system. Dollarization hinders the monetary policy transmission mechanism, but does not
pose an immediate financial stability threat.
●
Staff supported the 2005 budget, which embodies further fiscal and public debt retrenchment.
It envisages current spending restraint leading, for the first time, to a current surplus—thus, providing
for increased public investment. The budget is premised on a realistic projection of revenue, which
should help planning and implementation. Discussions covered policies to improve tax compliance,
taxpayer rights, budget process, expenditure management and civil service reform. In this context, the
authorities agreed to refrain from across-the-board wage increases in 2005 and will formally
eliminate inflation indexation of wages before the 2006 budget.
●
Other structural reforms have experienced increased momentum, notably privatization,
electricity sector restructuring, and national accounts statistics. But further progress in infrastructure
provision, economic statistics, and investment climate is needed. Indicators of absolute poverty have
improved reflecting increasing incomes, but targeted social programs need strengthening.
The accompanying supplementary Memorandum of Economic and Financial policies constitutes a
strong policy program and staff supports completion of the 2004 Article IV consultation, fifth review
of the program, and financing assurances review.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The overall macroeconomic performance of the Albanian economy has been
remarkable (Table 1). After a slowdown in 2002, growth has recovered to about
6 percent; inflation has declined, with the 12-month rate generally remaining within the
2–4 percent target of the Bank of Albania
(BoA); the lek has shown an appreciating

doubled (Figure 1). This has resulted in reductions in absolute poverty (Table 2), although
one fourth of the population is still below the poverty line and poverty alleviation remains a
key challenge.
2.
The continuation of high growth, however, cannot be taken for granted as a
self-sustained, broad-based expansion of tradeable output has not yet taken root.
Expansion of the market economy and an open trade regime have generated large increases
in productivity through reallocation of resources since the start of the transition (the private
sector now accounts for about ¾ of GDP). However, analyses by Fund and World Bank
(WB) staff indicate that this source of total factor productivity (TFP) growth may be
waning.1 In particular, nontradeable

which was 23 percent of GDP in
2004 (Table 3). This trade deficit has largely been covered by migrant remittances and
other private and official transfers from abroad, buttressing incomes and domestic demand.
But remittances and transfers cannot be relied upon to sustain the current fast growth pace
for much longer. Indeed, these sources can be expected to decline over time as a share of
GDP.

Therefore, looking towards the future, the challenge will be to foster
significant increases in competitiveness and high quality investment. The recent

This analysis and policy perspective has been at the core of earlier IMF Board
discussions and has been incorporated in the authorities’ Poverty Reduction Strategy
Papers (PRSPs).2 On occasion of the 2002 Article IV consultation, and more recently, at
the conclusion of the fourth review, Directors praised the good macroeconomic
performance of Albania, fiscal consolidation, adept monetary and prudential policies, and
selected structural reforms. Nevertheless, Directors also pointed out that a broad-based
export-driven expansion had not yet taken hold and stressed the need to accelerate
structural reforms, improve physical and financial infrastructure, and strengthen
governance and the rule of law.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
5.
Since the fourth review,
performance under the program has
been good and all program conditionality
has been observed. Quantitative and
structural performance criteria for endSeptember 2004 and the structural
performance criterion for end-2004 were all
met, some with significant margins (Table
4). Tax collections have met program
projections although foreign project-related
disbursements and grants continued to
underperform. In response, fiscal spending
was contained to meet program targets on
domestic borrowing—resulting in an
overall deficit lower than programmed by

1¼ percentage point of GDP (Tables 5a, 5b, and 6). Monetary conditions have stayed tight
and both BoA’s net domestic assets and international reserves also overperformed,
resulting in a comfortable 4-month reserve import cover (Table 7).
6.
Some structural reforms gained momentum in 2004—notably privatization,
financial framework development, electricity sector restructuring, customs
modernization, and budget process. The successful privatization of the large Savings
Bank (more than half of banking sector deposits) has revamped banking activity. In
addition, notable progress has been made on the privatization of other large public
enterprises—i.e., INSIG (insurance), Albtelecom (fixed-line telecom) and ARMO
(refinery)—and on implementation of the Power Sector Action Plan (PSAP), allowing the
elimination of electricity import subsidies in the 2005 budget. Customs modernization with
EU assistance—e.g., deploying the ASYCUDA system in the main custom houses (a
program performance criterion)—has tangibly improved efficiency and revenue. The
average custom clearing time has been reduced from more than five days in 2003 to below
two days, and seizures and cases submitted for prosecution have increased steeply—the
latter more than fivefold. Nevertheless, much remains to be done on tax administration, and
taxpayer harassment and poor professionalism of some public servants are consistently
singled out by private sector bodies as key investment deterrents. The 2005 budget
discussion process incorporated substantial advances in transparency, civil society
participation, and supporting analyses and information—including much improved revenue
forecasts and the simultaneous presentation for parliamentary discussion of the MediumTerm Expenditure Framework (MTEF).3
7.
However, progress on wider institutional reforms, mostly beyond the scope of
the program, has been protracted and suffered from increasing polarization in the
run-up to the mid-2005 general elections. Multilateral and bilateral donors are providing
assistance on a broad range of political and institutional reforms, but progress has been
slow. Partly as a result, ongoing negotiations on a Stabilization and Association agreement
with the EU have not yet been concluded. In its early-2004 Stabilisation and Association
Process report, the European Commission called for greater authorities’ commitment in
fighting organized crime, human trafficking, money laundering and corruption. Some
significant steps, however, have been taken in 2004, including the implementation of asset
disclosure requirements for public officials, passage of the property restitution law, and
active anti-money laundering collaboration.
8.
Turning to economic activity, output accelerated during the second half of
2004, after a weak start at the turn of the year, to an annual rate of about 6 percent.
While statistical evidence is scant, it seems that output decelerated substantially by end2003, partly due to stricter enforcement of urbanistic regulations that dampened
construction activity, and to restrained public spending. However, activity picked up in

2004Q2 underpinned by favorable weather
conditions that boosted agricultural and agroprocessing production, and electricity supply
aided by sectoral performance improvements.
Output accelerated further in the summer
supported by a strong tourism season,
increased remittances, and public investment.
Based on partial indicators of turnover,
annual GDP growth in 2004 is estimated at
about 6 percent—subject, however, to a wide
uncertainty margin.

about 6 percent with respect to the euro
during 2004 despite easing domestic interest rates and occasional BoA interventions. In
this regard, while Albania’s cost advantage remains wide, competitiveness may be starting
to erode.
10.
In collaboration with staff, INSTAT published recently 2001–02 national
accounts—incorporated in this paper—resulting in a 7 percent lower nominal GDP
level (Box 1). Beyond this level effect, the revisions do not alter the assessment of the
recent past (for which national accounts are not yet available).4

Box 1. National Accounts Revisions
The first national accounts for Albania, published in 2003, covered the period 1996-2001. In
September 2004, INSTAT issued 2002 national accounts and revised 2001 estimates. Figures
for periods after 2002 are preliminary estimates or projections agreed with the authorities,
but have no national accounts support. The main revisions introduced by the new national
accounts estimates are as follows.

Real GDP growth in 2002 has been corrected downwards reflecting a sharper drop in
electricity output and lower growth in industry and services.
Both 2001 and 2002 GDP deflators are now lower.
As a result, 2002 nominal GDP is now 7 percent lower than in previous staff
reports—a difference carried forward.

Other revisions for years after 2002 reflect estimates of activity in 2004, lek appreciation,
and WEO projections, including oil prices.

III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
11.
Discussions centered on the program objectives of cementing macroeconomic
stability, building up solid institutional frameworks for macroeconomic policy
implementation, and improving the investment climate. The authorities see the ongoing
expansion in financial intermediation as the cornerstone for expanding private investment
and moving economic activity into the formal sector. Thus, nurturing confidence in the
monetary policy framework and promoting financial development are key priorities. Given
the low level of external debt (17¼ percent of GDP, mainly official assistance), the
sustainability of public finances hinges on reducing the domestic borrowing requirement
and domestic debt, while the overall deficit is capped by the availability of donors’
assistance. Structural reforms on the fiscal area focus on channeling increasing resources to
investment in priority areas and improving the quality of fiscal institutions—including by
strengthening governance and implementation capacity. Other structural reforms

- 11 -

encompass privatization, sectoral restructuring, and removing barriers to investment—
aiming at promoting private sector development and completing the transition to a modern
rules-based market economy.
12.
The authorities agreed with the thrust of the staff’s analysis and
recommendations. In particular, there was agreement on the importance of medium termoriented structural reforms within the policy agenda. While there has been progress in this
area, stability of purpose and consistent implementation will be essential.
A. Macroeconomic Outlook
13.
The authorities envisaged 6 percent growth in 2005, which underlies budget
projections, or possibly even somewhat higher. Staff concurred that a number of
arguments supported this scenario, but with some downward risk. Domestic demand
appeared robust and activity was accelerating, further buttressed since the summer by
increased public investment and planned privatizations that would attract FDI and support
investors’ confidence. Banking intermediation and domestic lending was also growing and
several banks had started to tap the consumer credit market. The external current account
deficit (before official transfers) is projected to remain broadly unchanged as a share of
GDP, as export growth is offset by the negative impact of oil price increases and a
deceleration of external transfers. On the downside, however, the external environment will
probably be less expansionary than in 2004, particularly with a stronger lek, and
investment could slow down owing to electoral uncertainties.
14.
Over the medium term, under the assumption of an improved investment
climate, growth can remain close to its historical 6 percent trend. This expansion,
however, is predicated on rising exports and productivity, as structural reforms,
improvements in the business climate, financial intermediation, and credit facilitate
investment. Reforms to improve the efficiency of tax administration and budget
expenditure are envisaged to protect fiscal consolidation gains, while gradually permitting
greater expenditure on infrastructure and poverty alleviation. As export earnings and
domestic savings expand, the external deficit is projected to resume a downward trend,
although possibly remaining around 5–5½ percent of GDP in the medium term owing to
capital inflows and associated imports.
15.
The main risks to this scenario stem from possible floundering on structural
and institutional reforms. With low external liabilities, debt sustainability analyses
(DSAs) reveal limited vulnerability (Appendix IV). Under the central projection, DSAs
point to a steady improvement of the external and public finance positions—a robust
outcome under most stress tests. Nevertheless, the DSAs also show that curtailing the trade
deficit and sustaining high growth are essential to debt sustainability. Should investment
and exports disappoint, output growth could be significantly lower: while imports would
also undershot projections to some extent, the bulk of adjustment would need to fall on
domestic absorption.

B. Monetary and Financial Sector Policies
16.
Despite interest rate cuts, the monetary policy stance has remained tight and
inflation subdued—against the backdrop of a strengthening banking sector. The
BoA’s independence and determination in pursuing its price and financial stability
mandates has built credibility on the monetary and financial frameworks, and anchored
inflation expectations after the 2002 depreciation and banking stress episode. Although the
BoA’s policy rate has gradually eased since 2002

The newly appointed management of the BoA reaffirmed its commitment to
price stability, a flexible exchange rate regime, and central bank independence.
Although parliamentary appointment of the new BoA Board and Governor had suffered
delays and at times become politicized, the authorities provided assurances of their
commitment to BoA independence and a strong monetary policy framework. In this regard,
the Treasury’s overdraft facility with the BoA (which is seldom used, and always for

- 14 -

liquidity management and not for budget financing) is to be phased out, starting 2005; and
government securities have been issued to the BoA to cover the reserve valuation losses
stemming from the lek appreciation in accordance with the Central Bank Law (MEFP ¶18).
Staff supported BoA’s plans to reinforce its analytical and forecasting capabilities. In order
to raise the understanding of policy actions by financial market participants and enhance
the leading role of the BoA in setting expectations, staff recommended that Board meetings
be followed by public statements explaining the Board’s policy stance.
18.
There was also agreement that foreign exchange interventions should keep
aiming at smoothing out fluctuations, maintaining reserve cover, and facilitating the
shift towards lek assets of private sector balance sheets—without any exchange rate
target. There had recently been public calls for the BoA to counteract actively the strength
of the lek. However, the authorities consider that, while the lek appreciation has resulted in
some temporary loss of competitiveness, monetary policy should stay focused on the
inflation target. Moreover, the appreciation with respect to the US dollar is largely
explained by the evolution of the euro—which the lek broadly tracked during the second
half of 2004.
19.
With inflation subdued and the lek appreciating, the BoA’s gradual easing of
its policy stance had been appropriate, but there was agreement that a pause was now
warranted. Over 2004, increased lek demand, appreciation, and favorable domestic supply
conditions had allowed the interest rate to reach record lows without triggering inflation.
At the time of the discussions, however, expectations of price increases around the
holidays, agricultural output seasonality, and the possible lagged effect of higher
international oil prices argued for a waiting period with neutral bias before any further repo
rate move.
20.
The authorities are undertaking reforms to foster financial intermediation,
curtail the use of cash in the economy, and strengthen prudential supervision. Credit
to the private sector is still low (8½ percent of GDP in 2004), but it is growing fast at
30 percent annually and the banking sector is showing welcome dynamism and expanding
the range of its products. Supporting this process, the BoA successfully introduced a realtime gross settlement system and plans to launch in 2005 a bulk clearing system for small
transactions that will facilitate the payment of bills, credit card use, and other services
through the banking system. The government is channeling the payment of salaries through
banks, rather than using cash—which will improve governance and expenditure
management as well as household access to financial services (MEFP ¶16). The authorities
are also considering the development of an inter-bank collateralized money market and
foreign exchange swaps to foster better liquidity management and mitigate spot market
shocks. In staff’s view, measures to deepen the T-bill market also warrant consideration—
including extending participation to large enterprises and introducing market-making
arrangements. With MFD and WB assistance, the authorities are upgrading their prudential
monitoring capacity and taking an increasingly proactive approach to supervision. In this
vein, the authorities see the 2005 FSAP as an opportunity to assess financial stability issues

- 15 -

and chart future improvements in the monetary framework and supervisory capacity,
including in the incipient insurance sector.

C. Fiscal Policy
21.
The public finances have strengthened substantially over the past few years,
but progress on budget process and administration has lagged behind. The overall
deficit improved by about 3 percentage points of GDP in 2002-2004, reflecting expenditure
retrenchment. But, although tax collections have increased somewhat, primarily as a result
of tax policy measures, tax and customs administrations’ capacity remains low. Progress in
budget implementation, expenditure planning and control, and investment in priority areas

have been undermined by repeated over-optimistic budget revenue projections—resulting
in haphazard spending cuts when expected resources failed to materialize.
22.
In 2004, the authorities stayed the course of fiscal consolidation and, after
downward adjustments to revenue and expenditure projections during the fourth
review, budget implementation has improved. Through a supplementary budget, the
authorities allocated the Savings Bank privatization proceeds to investment and debt
reduction in equal parts, which jointly with a limited deficit, lek appreciation, and GDP
growth, resulted in a decline of 5½ percentage points in the debt-to-GDP ratio. In 2004, the
current budget is estimated to have been in broad balance, for the first time since transition.
Thus, budget financing—including borrowing and privatization receipts—funded only
investment.
23.
The 2005 budget embodies further reduction of the underlying domestic
borrowing and debt, improvements in spending composition, and a realistic revenue
projection. Staff supported the budget submitted to Parliament—including through
meetings with legislators. The 2005 budget envisages a reduction in underlying domestic
borrowing (i.e., excluding the effects of the Savings Bank privatization) by 0.2 percentages
points of GDP to 2.7 percent of GDP. This will help to accommodate the expected
expansion of private sector credit without triggering inflation and to maintain the public
debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward trend. While increasing somewhat total spending as a
share of GDP, it plans a reduction in current outlays—thus, redirecting resources to
investment in priority areas and further improving the current balance. Crucially, the
expenditure plans are based on a credible revenue forecast, based on past realizations and
not on previous over-optimistic budgets that remained under-realized. The budget also
envisages the divestment of the remaining minority stakes in banking and other companies.
The ongoing privatization of Albtelecom has not been budgeted given uncertainties as to its
timing and amount. The authorities, however, reiterated their commitment to continue
devoting half of the proceeds of all large privatizations to debt redemption.
24.
While the 2005 fiscal package is a significant first step, substantial additional
efforts are needed to modernize and enhance the efficiency of revenue administration
(MEFP ¶12). The authorities plan to expand ASYCUDA to the remaining custom houses
and apply risk assessment methods for inspections. Staff argued that, likewise, tax
administration reforms should emphasize the implementation of standardized procedures
and risk assessment methods, strict application of existing regulations (reforming them if
necessary), training and professional qualification of tax officials, fair and professional
taxpayer relations, and extensive use of information technology. Staff supported the thrust
of the 2005 fiscal package along these lines, including the implementation of many FAD
TA recommendations (Box 3). But it argued against some of the measures included in the
package: The introduction of a VAT exemption of providers to exporters and filing
requirements beyond the monitoring capabilities of the tax administration risk adding
opportunities for noncompliance. The authorities agreed to discuss these issues with
upcoming FAD TA, supplementing the enacted package as necessary. Also, the authorities

- 17 -

have adopted a plan to clear VAT refund arrears to exporters (0.1 percent of GDP) and
implement a quick refund system in 2005.

Box 3. 2005 Fiscal Package
The 2005 fiscal package aims at improving revenue administration. The cost of the
package is about 0.3 percent of GDP in 2005. Its main measures are the following.
Reducing administrative complexity and tax evasion:
• subjecting the first sale of residential units to VAT, while exempting rental
payments starting in 2006;
• eliminating the requirement for small businesses to renew their registration every
year;
• reducing the number of personal income tax brackets to 5 from 7;
• including social security contributions in the base of the personal income tax;
• introducing personal income tax returns.
Bringing tax obligations on businesses closer to the regional average:
• reducing the corporate income tax rate from 25 percent to 23 percent in 2005, and to
20 percent in 2006;
• reducing the small business tax rate on turnover from 4 percent to 3 percent;
• exempting from VAT sub-contractors of re-export companies;
• shortening from 6 to 3 months the obligatory carry-forward period before
reimbursement of VAT credit.
Strengthening taxpayers’ rights:
• strengthening appeal procedures with clear steps for appeal escalation and time
limits for issuing decisions;
• limiting the response period for VAT refund requests (before interest charges apply)
to 30 days;
• introducing accrual of interest on overdue tax refunds.
25.
Other structural reforms in the fiscal area also need to be accelerated with a
focus on improving the budget process, expenditure management, and civil service
and public pay reform (MEFP ¶13). The mission discussed means to enhance the
medium-term orientation of the budget, including by casting it on a rolling multi-year
projection. The authorities plan to build up capacity to manage expenditure and monitor
investment projects that extend over the medium term, including by introducing
information technology and strengthening public procurement and tendering procedures. In
this regard, staff expressed concern about the Tirana-Rinas-Durrës railway project which,
after receiving the results of the independent feasibility study, the authorities were

- 18 -

considering to undertake. In the authorities’ view, the project would have significant spillover effects on growth. In contrast, WB staff has argued that an alternative focus on
improving the road network, including secondary and local roads, would be more
consistent with the authorities’ NSSED and would represent a better use of limited public
funds—EU recommendations on transportation sector strategy also support these relative
priorities. The mission stressed that, in any case, the associated budgetary and financial
impact would need to be accommodated within the medium-term expenditure envelope and
without undermining the declining path of public debt. Regarding wage policy, the
authorities intend to refrain from granting automatic across-the-board public pay increases
in 2005. Instead, they will use the wage bill expansion appropriated in the budget to
implement targeted wage increments in priority sectors and performance incentives
associated with the civil service reform. The authorities also intend to formally repeal the
automatic indexation of wages prior to the formulation of the 2006 budget.
26.
The mission discussed medium-term plans to maintain the downward course of
public debt while making preparations to tap international financial markets as
concessional assistance declines (Table 8). While aiming for a full mobilization and
effective use of domestic budget resources, the authorities are considering how to replace
concessional foreign assistance over time in a cost-effective manner and without crowding
out domestic investment. In this regard, staff welcomed plans to improve debt management
and recommended considering steps to obtain a sovereign credit rating—which would
introduce an additional source of policy discipline and facilitate market access for the
larger domestic firms. While the authorities agreed on this recommendation, they argued
for pacing the access to international capital markets with improvements in the budget
framework to ensure the efficient use of the additional resources.

D. Poverty Alleviation and Other Structural Reforms
27.
Rising incomes have underpinned progress along some basic dimensions of
poverty—although poverty remains a key policy priority (Box 4). Consistent time
series data are still wanting but indicators of absolute poverty, such as population with
daily expenditure below US$2, and child and maternal mortality appear to have improved
(Table 2). Analyses point to the key positive role played by sustained high growth, selected
social assistance programs, and non-official safety net arrangements—including migrant
remittances and micro-credit networks. The evidence, however, is not all positive, as some
social indicators (e.g., educational enrollment) have deteriorated. The authorities are
improving social assistance targeting in collaboration with municipal governments and are

vehicle has prompted better targeting and budget savings, while helping to forestall

A successful poverty reduction strategy should focus on sustaining growth and

The authorities’ privatization agenda is making substantial progress
(MEFP ¶ 19 ). As indicated above, after privatizing the Savings Bank and completing the
pre-privatization of INSIG with IFC and EBRD participation, the authorities have started
the privatization of Albtelecom (abolishing also its international communications
monopoly) and ARMO, and the 2005 budget envisages divestment of other public stakes.
The authorities intend to follow with privatization or concession of most of the few
remaining public companies.

Reforms in other areas, however, have encountered mixed success. Business
climate indicators remain disappointing. The authorities are planning to update their action
plan to remove barriers to investment (including licensing and registration procedures)
based on new surveys conducted in recent months (MEFP ¶21). But faster progress will be

Severe statistical deficiencies hamper policy formulation and the mission
discussed plans to improve economic statistics (MEFP ¶24). A statistical law was
passed and 1996-2002 national accounts were published in 2004. With STA and other
assistance, INSTAT plans to improve availability of economic indicators, including an
experimental quarterly GDP (Box 5).

- 23 -

Box 5. Structural Conditionality
In addition to implementing 2005 fiscal package (Box 3, MEFP ¶12), structural conditionality
focuses on the following areas, deemed critical to achieving program objectives.
•

Reforms of the tax administration, and the budget and expenditure process: (i) extend
the ASYCUDA system and implement the ASYCUDA risk assessment module in 5
customs houses (¶24;MEFP¶12); (ii) implement a system of rapid VAT refunds, and clear
the VAT refunds originated prior to June 2004, preparing quarterly reports (¶24;MEFP¶12);
(iii) implement measures to raise efficiency and transparency of expenditure, including
formally repeal price indexation of wages (MEFP¶13); (iv) carry out independent
feasibility studies for large projects funded by non-concessional borrowing (MEFP¶21);
(vi) continue to reschedule the arrears on inoperative payments agreements with official
creditors (Article XIV) and conclude this process with official creditors by the end of the
program (¶34;MEFP¶23).

•

Financial development and reduction of the use of cash, governance and business
climate: (i) increase the number of public employees paid through the banking system
(¶20;MEFP¶16); and, (ii); continue to implement the action plan to remove administrative
barriers to investment (¶30;MEFP¶21;NSSED Chapter 7).

•

Quality and coverage of economic statistics (¶31; MEFP¶24): (i) present to Parliament a
5-year statistical program; (ii) publish the preliminary 2003 national accounts and introduce
pilot quarterly GDP estimates; (iv) issue 2004 national accounts.

World Bank Structural Conditionality
Bank’s conditionality focuses on implementing the action plan to modernize the electricity
sector (¶29;MEFP¶20); governance and institution building sustainable private sector
development; human development, and restructuring of key sectors (Appendix II).

E. External Policies
32.
Albania has a floating exchange rate regime and there was agreement that this
has served the country well. The rapid transformation of the economy makes the
underlying equilibrium exchange rate level a dynamic parameter subject to wide
uncertainty. In this context, a market-determined flexible exchange rate has proven a useful
means to forestall misalignments. Moreover, as a small open economy, Albania is buffeted
by external, confidence, and domestic supply shocks and the flexibility of the exchange
rate remains a necessary buffer to facilitate adjustment. Further, the still significant
dollarization levels would undermine achieving durably any exchange rate target in the
face of changing fundamentals.

- 24 -

33.
Albania benefits from one of the most open trade regimes among transition
countries. Import tariffs are among the lowest in the region, coupled with very limited
nontariff barriers; and several regional free-trade agreements are in effect.5

34.
Albania maintains restrictions in accordance with Article XIV in the form of
outstanding debit balances from inoperative bilateral payments agreements in former
nonconvertible and convertible currencies. These agreements were in place before
Albania became a member of the Fund. As of October 2004, outstanding debit balances
were maintained with Algeria, Cuba, the Czech Republic, Greece, Poland, Romania, the
Slovak Republic, Vietnam, and Serbia and Montenegro. In 2004, arrears with Hungary
were cleared and balances with the Czech and Slovak Republics, and Poland reconciled.
An agreement with Romania is planned to be signed in early 2005.
35.
The program for 2005 is fully financed. The 2005 financing gap (US$ 82 million)
is expected to be covered with donors assistance and bilateral arrears rescheduling
(Tables 9, 10, 11, and 12).
36.
The authorities are committed to clear all remaining debit balances with
official creditors by the end of the program and with private creditors by 2006.
However, incomplete documentation and counterpart delays in some cases have hindered
progress. Staff urged the authorities to continue efforts to clear all outstanding arrears.
Regarding the financing assurances review, in 2004 arrears with a company based in FYR
Macedonia were cleared and negotiations with remaining private creditors continued. No
new arrears have been incurred and the existence of the unsettled amounts does not put the
recovery of the Fund’s credit at risk. Fund’s exposure with Albania is very limited
(SDR 62 million or 128 percent of its quota) and projected to decrease after 2005. Fund’s
debt service represents less than 1 percent of exports.

The free trade area comprises Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Kosovo, FYR
Macedonia, Moldova, Romania, and Serbia and Montenegro.

F. Program Issues
37.
It is proposed that the last disbursement under the arrangement be conditional
on the observance of end-March 2005 quantitative performance criteria, end-March
and End-June 2005 structural performance criteria, and the completion of the sixth
review (Table 13).
38.
The authorities broadly agreed with the conclusions of the accompanying Ex
Post Assessment, and expressed preference for a three-year successor arrangement. In
their view, the Fund had provided valuable input in the design and implementation of
structural reforms through appropriately focused conditionality. They stressed the role of
Fund conditionality in maintaining reform momentum, including by catalyzing political
wills and shoring up consensus. They considered that a three-year successor arrangement
would provide medium-term certainty to investors and donors regarding macroeconomic
prospects and institutional reform continuity. In this connection, drawings (even if small)
provided a significant signal. The authorities and donors envisaged that program
conditionality could play a key role in the Stabilization and Association process with the
EU. The authorities also indicated interest on wider room within the program to develop
stronger ownership.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
The macroeconomic performance of the Albanian economy in recent years has
been remarkable, but maintaining growth and reducing poverty will require
improving external competitiveness and attracting strategic investment. Growth has
recovered to about 6 percent without rekindling inflation, and confidence in the lek and the
financial sector has firmed up. This performance owes much to the authorities’
perseverance on fiscal consolidation and public debt reduction, sound monetary and
financial sector policies, privatization, and restructuring of the strategic energy sector.
However, growth has been driven to a large extent by nontradeables, with buoyant
domestic demand and incomes supported by migrant remittances and external transfers—
while limited progress has been made in reducing trade imbalances. Looking ahead, growth
prospects depend crucially on attracting high quality investment and fostering outwardoriented activity.
40.
The outlook is for a continuation of growth at about its 6 percent trend in
2005. The current demand strength is set to continue into 2005 underpinned by public
investment and rising credit to the private sector from its current low level, including
consumer credit. However, political uncertainties and a less stimulative external
environment pose downward risks—particularly since the real effective appreciation of the
lek may have eroded competitiveness in some sectors.
41.
Over the medium term, export-oriented investment and associated
productivity is expected to improve gradually the trade balance and increasingly
drive growth. Although external indebtedness is limited, DSAs confirm that external

- 26 -

sustainability hinges on successfully improving competitiveness and maintaining growth.
Therefore, it is essential that macroeconomic stability be complemented with
improvements in infrastructure and the investment environment. Beyond traditional
macroeconomic policy-related structural reforms, a fuller integration of Albania in the
regional and world economies will require progress in institutional reforms that promote
the establishment and protection of property rights, and complete the transition to a rulesbased market economy.
42.
The authorities’ determination in building a sound monetary policy
framework has been instrumental to macroeconomic stability. This framework is
appropriately based on a clear BoA mandate on price and financial stability; central bank
independence; and a flexible exchange rate regime. Its credibility will require that BoA’s
foreign exchange interventions continue avoiding any explicit or implicit exchange rate
target. Plans to introduce a bulk clearing system and a collateralized inter-bank money
market are well timed to support financial development with market infrastructure
provision—and would be buttressed by measures to deepen the T-bill market and allow
trading of foreign exchange swaps. The ongoing expansion of financial intermediation is
welcome but will require improvements in supervisory capacity, encompassing the
insurance sector. The upcoming FSAP will provide an opportunity to advance in this
direction. Payment of government wages through the banking system will be an important
catalyst for increased banking intermediation of transactions—reducing the use of cash and
opportunities for informality and misgovernance.
43.
The gradual easing of the monetary policy stance since 2002 has been
appropriate, but the current pause and neutral bias are warranted. Whereas there may
be further room for easing in 2005 if current trends continue, the policy direction should be
reconsidered afresh as more evidence becomes available on seasonal price pressures, fuel
price effects, and international conditions.
44.
Much progress has been made in consolidating the public finances and the
2005 budget is a further step in that direction. The continued reduction in the underlying
domestic borrowing requirement and declining profile of public debt are appropriate to
crowd in private sector credit and in anticipation of a likely decline of concessional
assistance. The budget emphasis in curtailing current spending to a level commensurate
with a realistic projection of recurrent revenue—thus devoting borrowing and privatization
resources fully to invest—is a substantial step forward in the quality of expenditure and
fiscal sustainability. The decision to replace across-the-board wage increases by targeted
incentives to improve performance and services in priority areas, and to formally repeal
wage indexation before the 2006 budget will further enhance expenditure efficiency. In an
election year, the authorities’ determination to persevere at fiscal consolidation and
improve the budget process is commendable and should cement credibility and investors’
confidence.
45.
Progress in capacity building and fiscal institutions reform, however, has been
weak and needs to be accelerated. The 2005 fiscal package and other current initiatives

- 27 -

contain many positive elements that, if consistently implemented, could enhance the
efficiency of the tax system. The introduction of an effective VAT refund mechanism
should be a priority as it would reduce export costs and benefit the investment climate. But
broader tax administration reforms are necessary to substantially boost compliance and
mobilize budget resources—including standardized procedures, risk analysis-based audit
methods, information technology, and human resource rationalization. Likewise, on the
spending side, control and tendering procedures; payment, commitment and reporting
systems; and treasury and debt management need strengthening.
46.
Privatization and electricity sector reforms have achieved substantial success,
but structural and institutional reforms in other areas need to be intensified. We
welcome the start of the privatization process of Albtelecom and ARMO; the decision to
sell the minority public stake in banking and telecommunications; and the end of the
Albtelecom monopoly on international communications. While vigilance has prevented the
emergence of new inter-enterprise arrears, eliminating pressures in this direction will
require restructuring of the water provision system and other utilities to ensure their
viability. While data provision to the Fund is adequate, plans to expedite and improve the
production of economic statistics are welcome and should be considered a priority.
47.
Program implementation has been good and the supplementary MEFP
contains a strong policy program to preserve macroeconomic stability and foster
growth. The authorities continued appropriate good-faith efforts to reach agreements with
official and private external creditors on remaining arrears. Staff therefore supports the
authorities’ request for completion of the fifth review and financing assurances review, and
for a 5-month extension of the program to allow for the sixth review and associated
disbursement to take place during the program period. It is proposed that Albania be kept
on a 24-month Article IV consultation cycle, subject to the provisions of Board decision
number 127-94 (02/76).
48.
Given the extensive reform agenda and the authorities’ preference, a successor
medium-term arrangement appears appropriate, as discussed in the accompanying
EPA. The nature of the successor arrangement, would depend on Albania’s PRGF
eligibility following expiration of the current arrangement.

1/ Data up to and including 2001 are based on the previous reporting standard. As of December 2002, data are based on a new reporting standard, in accordance with the 2000 Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. The main
changes are the exclusion of blocked deposits from broad money (Lek 10.7 billion at end-2002) and the inclusion of accrued interest in assets and liabilities. Data exclude the balance sheet of the Bank Asset
Resolution Trust (BART). In particular, private sector credit of lek 6.1 billion is excluded as of September 2001, when it was transferred to the BART from the Savings Bank.
2/ The series (on the old reporting standard) includes a break at end-2002, as a change in definitions lowered NFA by Lek 1.4 billion, raising other items net by the same amount.
3/ Excluding credit transferred to the BART.

VII. Safeguards Assessments:
Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Bank of Albania (BoA) is subject to a
full safeguards assessment with respect to the PRGF arrangement, which was finalized in
June 2002, and has taken into account prior safeguards work, including an assessment
report issued in May 2001, and a monitoring mission conducted in March 2002. The
assessment noted that the bank has made significant progress in implementing the
recommendations of the first safeguards assessment, and that, in general, the bank has
adequate safeguards in place to reduce the risk of misuse and misreporting of Fund
resources. Nevertheless, the assessment noted minor weaknesses in the bank’s internal

- 47 -

APPENDIX I

auditing, financial reporting, and internal control systems, all of which BoA management
agreed to address.
VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangement:
On July 1, 1992 the Albanian authorities adopted a floating exchange rate system (an
independent float). Under the Fund’s de facto exchange rate regime classification, Albania
follows an independently floating exchange rate regime—although the monetary
authorities occasionally intervene in the foreign exchange market with the objective of
smoothing temporary fluctuations. Albania’s exchange rate arrangement is free from
exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to Fund jurisdiction under
Article VIII. However, the country still avails itself of the transitional arrangements under
Article XIV and maintains exchange restrictions in the form of outstanding debit balances
on inoperative bilateral payment agreements, which were in place before Albania became
a Fund member. Albania has not imposed new restrictions under Article VIII. The
exchange rate stood at 92.7 lek per U.S. dollar on December 31, 2004.
IX. Article IV Consultation:
The conclusion of the 2002 Article IV consultation and the first review under the threeyear PRGF arrangement took place in February 2003 (IMF Country Report No. 03/63).
Albania has moved from a 12-month cycle to a 24-month cycle, in line with the decision
on consultation cycles approved on July 15, 2002.
X. FSAP Participation and ROSCs:
An FSAP is scheduled for early 2005. A ROSC on data dissemination was published on
the Fund’s website in May 2000. A fiscal ROSC was completed in June 2003. Albania
participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS), and a complete set of
GDDS metadata for the external, financial, fiscal, and real sectors, as well as for the sociodemographic indicators is posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(http://dsbb.imf.org).
XI. Technical Assistance:
The Fund, other multilateral organizations and donors have provided extensive assistance
for institutional development in Albania. The Fund alone has sent several technical
assistance missions to Albania every year since 1991. However, further institutional
development is required in virtually every sector.
IX. Resident Representative:
A Fund resident representative has been posted in Tirana since April 1993; Mr. Jan-Peter
Olters has held this position since March 2002.

APPENDIX II

ALBANIA: IMF-WORLD BANK RELATIONS
Partnership in Albania’s Development Strategy
The National Strategy for Socio-Economic Development (NSSED), presented to the
Boards of the IMF and the Bank in June 2002 and subsequently updated in May 2003 and
June 2004 is a comprehensive development strategy that emphasizes poverty reduction.
The NSSED has two pillars—strengthening governance and achieving high economic
growth—and gives priority to improving education, healthcare, and infrastructure.
The IMF will continue to take the lead in assisting Albania to maintain macroeconomic
stability and financial sustainability through setting quantitative targets within the
framework of its Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)–supported program in
2002 and the subsequent reviews of the program in February 2003, July 2003, and
January 2004. In addition, the IMF’s structural conditionality focuses on three main
categories: fiscal management and control; payments discipline; governance, and
privatization.
The Bank leads the policy dialogue in financial sector reforms, power sector reforms,
social sector and pension reforms, as well as public expenditure management and public
administration reform, and collaborates closely with the IMF on implementation.
Bank Group Strategy
The Bank’s operations have been designed to support Albania’s implementation of its
NSSED. Therefore, in line with the objectives of the NSSED, the Bank focuses on three
priorities:
•

Improve governance and strengthen institutions, by strengthening transparency
and accountability at all levels, increasing the contestability of the policy
formulation process, and improving policy monitoring and evaluation.

•

Promote sustainable private sector growth, through improving the environment
for private sector development, continuing financial sector reforms, sustaining
agricultural growth, improving infrastructure and promoting environmentally
sustainable use of natural resources.

•

Foster human development, by improving access to and quality of education and
healthcare, strengthening the sustainability and equity of the social insurance
system, and improving targeting and efficacy of social assistance and community
social services.

- 49 -

APPENDIX II

Overall, the Bank’s lending operations reflect a cross-sectoral emphasis on reducing
poverty, strengthening institutions, and increasing transparency and accountability. To
date, the Bank has approved a total of 55 operations amounting to US$764 million, of
which US$605.9 millions have been disbursed. For the remainder of FY05, the Bank will
continue to use investment lending as well as country analytic work to support the
NSSED. In line with its Country Assistance Strategy, which covers FY03-05, the Bank
has completed its Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) program, and is still
planning up to 4 possible investment operations in power, transport, and environment
expected to be approved before July 2005.
The PRSC-1 was presented to the Board in June 2002, the PRSC-2 in July 2003 and the
PRSC-3 in early December 2004. The disbursement of the PRSC3 took place at end
December 2004. The PRSCs provided a strong core for the Bank’s lending program and
focus on multi-sectoral and thematic policy reforms that are best addressed through a
single adjustment operation. The four key areas supported under the PRSCs are:
promoting sustainable growth and private sector development; strengthening capacity to
monitor and evaluate the policy agenda; improving service delivery and social safety net
effectiveness; and improving core public functions and institutional arrangements. The
PRSCs and the investment operations are complementary and mutually reinforcing: the
PRSCs support reforms crucial for investment projects, while investment projects help
build the capacity needed to implement reforms. Beyond the PRSC program, the
Government confirmed its commitment to continue with the necessary actions to enhance
performance in priority areas, improve governance and give a new impetus to private
sector development as outlined in their Letter of Development Policy.
The Bank will continue work to strengthen external partnerships, particularly with the
EU, which began negotiations towards a Stabilization and Association Agreement with
Albania in early 2003. The Bank will continue to ensure a close collaboration with the
IMF in major areas of reforms.
Bank-Fund Collaboration in Specific Areas
As part of its overall assistance to Albania—through the PRSC, investment lending, and
country analytic work—the Bank supports policy reforms in the following main areas, in
close collaboration with the IMF:
•

Financial sector reforms

Following the civil crisis in 1997, triggered by the collapse of the pyramid schemes,
Albania began implementing a broad-based program of reforms in the public
administration and financial sectors. The Government’s reform program has been
formulated as part of its NSSED and aims at divesting the State from the banking and
insurance sector and at the establishment of sound governance structures in the financial

- 50 -

APPENDIX II

institutions. Its priority has been the revival of banking sector reforms, which are now
well underway.
The Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (FSAC), approved by the Board in June 2002,
has helped to advance reforms in the banking sector. Measures supported by the Bank
include the privatization of the Savings Bank, the development of a deposit insurance
system, improvement of the bankruptcy framework and collateral enforcement, and
strengthening of bank regulation and supervision, which will also assist the
Government’s anti-money laundering efforts. The IMF has provided technical assistance
to the Bank of Albania. The IMF is also funding a resident adviser to support the
implementation of the institutional development program for banking supervision
developed by the Bank of Albania.
The Government’s program of reforms in the sector has been agreed in consultation with the
Bank and the IMF, and the two institutions support the Government’s strategy. The
restructuring of the financial sector is progressing well, and the successful privatization of
the Savings Bank in January 2004 represented a major achievement towards reform of the
system. The second and final tranche of the Bank’s FSAC is expected to be disbursed in late
2004. Progress gained further momentum during 2004, on other elements of the program as
well, such as, insurance sector legal and regulatory framework and bankruptcy framework,
resulting in completion of all the Government’s obligations under the FSAC. The second and
final tranche of the FSAC was disbursed on December 24, 2004. The Government has
reconfirmed its commitment and has indicated its intention to continue with the overall
reforms beyond the FSAC Closing Date of December 31, 2004. The upcoming FSAP will
lay down a structured program of reform that the Bank would support in close collaboration
with the IMF.
•

Power sector

Since mid-2000, Albania has experienced a severe electricity shortage, necessitating
extensive power outages despite large Government subsidies for imports of electricity.
The crisis resulted from several factors: excessive demand caused by a chronic failure to
curb illegal use and nonpayment; impact of a dry hydrological cycle on the largely
hydropower-based system; and transmission capacity constraints limiting electricity
imports. Recognizing the magnitude of the crisis and its wide-ranging macroeconomic
and social implications, at the end of 2000 the Government began to develop, in
consultation with the World Bank, the multi-year power sector action plan. The main
objectives of this action plan are: to curtail illegal use of electricity; to improve the
financial situation of KESH; to reduce excessive demand and budgetary subsidies; and to
increase domestic generating capacity. Implementation of this plan has been largely
successful and there have been significant improvements in power sector performance.
However, much still remains to be done and significant investments are required to
increase domestic generation capacity and to upgrade the existing transmission and

- 51 -

APPENDIX II

distribution network. The power sector action plan for the period 2005-2007 was
recently finalized. It takes into account the progress achieved so far in improving the
electricity situation within Albania, as well as additional proposals and requirements to
further improve performance and secure funding for additional investments.
The Bank has played the lead role in coordinating a unified stance among power sector
donors on major sector issues, and has assisted the Government in shaping sector policy.
Conditionality related to improving sector performance, sector restructuring, and
strengthening the regulatory and legislative framework is included in the Power Sector
Rehabilitation and Restructuring Project, which was approved by the Board in June 2002.
A new thermal generation investment is also being supported through a project approved
by the Bank’s Board in March of 2004, with cofinancing from EBRD and EIB. The Bank
and the Fund support the Government’s strategy for overcoming the crisis in the
electricity sector and agree with the authorities that sustained implementation of the
agreed measures to improve the performance in the power sector will be indispensable
for growth and macroeconomic stability.
•

Social sectors and pension reform

The Government’s pension reform aims to reduce the reliance of the pension system on
budgetary transfers, while addressing the overall, longer-term problems of coverage,
affordability, equity, and adequacy. The Social Insurance Institute (SII) reports that the
deficit of the social insurance system, had fallen to 0.25 percent of GDP in 2003,
compared with 3.3 percent of GDP in 1993. This needs to be considered, however, in
conjunction with arrangements whereby the state budget now finances unemployment
and maternity benefits, for which the Social Insurance Institute continues to collect social
insurance contributions. Projections made in 2002 showed that the deficit would have
increased significantly in the medium to longer term in the absence of the reforms that
the Government has adopted.
The Fund has stressed the importance of pension reform as a key component of medium
term fiscal consolidation, and has provided policy advice to the Social Insurance Institute
on the reform options available to the Government. The Bank has focused intensively on
pension reform under the framework of the PRSC program, and has agreed with the
Government on a comprehensive program of related parametric reforms. Reforms
implemented under the PRSC framework included, inter alia: (i) increasing the
retirement age for men and women; (ii) reducing the contribution rates for employees’
pensions and other social insurance benefits; (iii) changing the base for assessing
contributions designed to increase collections for employees’ pensions; (iv) improving
performance in collecting pension contributions; (v) narrowing the gap in pension levels
for self-employed rural and urban workers, as well as increasing their levels in real terms;
and (vi) raising contribution rates for self-employed rural workers, which are currently
extremely low. The Bank and the Fund both fully support the approach being adopted in

- 52 -

APPENDIX II

this sector, with related conditionality fully incorporated within the Bank-supported
PRSC program.
Albania’s ability to ensure the health and welfare of its population has been compromised
by a weak physical infrastructure, major shifts in demography including significant
population movements, internal and regional instability, limited governance capacity,
poor resource management and weak technical capabilities. Restructuring and reform of
basic social services is therefore a priority element of poverty reduction. The
Government’s program aims to address under-funding in health and education by
increasing budgetary allocations to these sectors under the Medium-Term Budget
Program (MTBP), while also outlining reforms to improve the access and quality of
education and health, as well as the targeting efficiency of social protection. The Fund
has addressed a number of related measures during its regular review of the budget and
the MTBP. The Bank is supporting a comprehensive program of sector reforms through
the PRSC, specific investment loans (for the human development sectors and public
administration reform), and a program of economic and sector work. The Bank program
focuses on strengthening sector management to improve the Government’s ability to
develop, monitor, and evaluate an effective policy agenda. The social sector
conditionality is fully incorporated within the Bank supported PRSC program, with the
Fund also monitoring the budgetary impacts of social sector reform as a part of its regular
dialogue with the Government. The Bank has completed and submitted to Government
for comments a comprehensive SSNS (Social Safety Net Study) in November 2004.
•

Public expenditure management

Key challenges include: (i) ensuring that Government efforts create a transparent budget
decision making process become self-sustaining; (ii) improving the usefulness, quality,
and timeliness of information upon which budget decisions are made; and (iii) enhancing
budget execution transparency and accountability mechanisms, including audit
mechanisms. To meet these challenges, the Government has continued to make the
MTBP the centerpiece of its budget formulation process to prioritize expenditures more
efficiently and to strengthen the linkages between policy objectives and budget planning.
As a first step in this process, and as part of the PRSC, the Government has linked the
preparation of the NSSED with the preparation of the MTBP. Continuing work to
improve the linkages of the annual budget with the MTBP, and the latter with the NSSED
is an important focus of both the Bank and the Fund.
To increase the effectiveness of the NSSED programs, the Government, as part of the
PRSC, has committed to undertake a number of measures to further improve the public
expenditure management process, including preparing an action plan for strengthening
budget systems, procedures, and monitoring of budget outputs; training budget staff in
line ministries; and preparing procedures for recording disbursement and expenditures on
all externally-financed projects, including those financed by grants. To improve

- 53 -

APPENDIX II

transparency and accountability the Government will also take steps to improve financial
reporting and audit functions.
The PRGF-supported program complements the above-mentioned measures by focusing
on fiscal management and control, payment discipline, and mobilizing adequate
resources for expenditure priorities under the NSSED. In particular, strengthening tax
and customs revenues, improving budget control of foreign-financed projects and stateowned enterprises are included in the program and deemed essential for safeguarding the
programmed fiscal adjustment. Moreover, actions envisaged to regularize inter-enterprise
and external arrears help address the issues of contingent budget liabilities as well as
ongoing payment discipline and improved debt management. In the view of Bank staff,
these measures will help maintain fiscal sustainability, and together with monetary and
exchange rate policy of the PRGF-supported program, will help ensure a sound
macroeconomic environment for sustainable growth.

APPENDIX III

ALBANIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Albania has made significant progress in improving its statistical database with extensive
technical assistance, including technical assistance from the Fund. The multisector statistics
mission of February 1999 secured the agreement of the authorities on an action plan for each
of the major statistical areas, identifying the concrete steps and timetable for improving
Albania’s macroeconomic statistics. This mission was followed by several other missions in
the areas identified as priority. The authorities have thus far made progress in implementing
the action plan agreed with the multisector statistics mission as well as the recommendations
of follow-up missions. The Council of Statistics has been established and its constitution and
functions have been ratified. However, much still remains to be done, in particular as regards
the medium-term objective of improving the compilation of the national accounts.
Albania was selected as a pilot country for the preparation of the data dissemination module
of the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC), and the ROSC was
published in the Funds’ website in May 2000.1 Albania participates in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS). A complete set of GDDS metadata for the external,
financial, fiscal, and real sectors, as well as for the socio-demographic indicators is posted
and regularly updated on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(http://dsbb.imf.org). The metadata also include a comprehensive summary of plans for
improving data compilation and dissemination across all statistical sectors, including sociodemographic indicators.
A. Real Sector
Price statistics
STA has provided considerable technical assistance to Albania on price statistics. Data on
consumer price index (CPI) are reported regularly for publication in the Albania page in
International Financial Statistics (IFS). In 2001, a revision of CPI weights was initiated by
INSTAT based on a new household budget survey and a revised CPI was finalized in
February 2002. The compilation of the CPI generally follows international standards, and the
estimation of imputed rent within the CPI has been improved in 2003. As regards the
producer price index (PPI), STA missions of May 2000 and January 2002 assisted INSTAT
in finalizing the development of this index. The official monthly PPI has been published on a
quarterly frequency since March 2002.
National accounts
Until recently, and in the absence of official national accounts aggregates since 1990, Fund
staff relied on their own estimates prepared in consultation with the authorities. These
estimates were based on very partial data on (gross) agricultural output, activity in state
industrial production, and extremely limited information on private sector activity. With
1

Albania’s ROSC (data module) was undertaken before the formal adoption of the Data
Quality Assessment Framework.

- 55 -

APPENDIX III

technical assistance from STA, consisting of a resident advisor in 1999 and follow-up
missions in 2001 and 2002, INSTAT published in January 2003 the first official GDP
estimates for 1996-2000 and later in the year preliminary estimates for 2001 GDP.
Preliminary estimates for the 2002 GDP and revised estimates for the 2001 GDP were
published in September 2004. However, the estimates continue to be hampered by
weaknesses in basic data sources and incomplete coverage of the private sector.
STA formulated a technical assistance project for which the Italian government has agreed to
commit $500,000 from its sub account with the IMF over a period of two years (November
2003–November 2005). The project is aimed at further improving the national accounts
estimates and basic source data. The Italian National Institute of Statistics (Istat) and the
National Statistics Office of Finland (Statistics Finland) are providing technical assistance to
INSTAT following the project contract.
A STA statistical mission visited Albania in November 2004 to assist the authorities in
improving the timeliness of the national accounts data. The authorities agreed with the
proposed approaches for compiling and disseminating early annual estimates and
experimental quarterly estimates..
External trade
Data collection suffered extensively during the 1997 crisis as a number of customs posts
were damaged or destroyed, and there was most likely a large temporary increase in the
volume of unreported transactions. After some delays due to the Kosovo crisis, the
compilation and dissemination of foreign trade data have started again. Plans for improving
the quality of trade statistics include the forthcoming introduction of the Automated System
of Customs Data (ASYCUDA) with EU assistance.
B. Government Finance
Albania reported fiscal data (for 1995) for the first time in 1996 for publication in the 1996
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook and IFS. In March 1998, the authorities started to
publish a new quarterly bulletin of government statistics. The STA multisector statistics
mission in 1999 assisted in upgrading the quality of the data reported in this publication to
GFSM 1986 standards and developing a system for the regular and timely reporting of data to
the Fund for publication. Data for 1997 and 1998 and again for 2002 have since been
reported for inclusion in the GFS Yearbook. Albania currently does not report data for
inclusion in the IFS. Some improvement in the collection of data on disbursement of foreign
loans and grants has been achieved under the technical assistance provided by UNCTAD. A
foreign debt database has been established and is nearly operational, requiring only auditing
for final implementation. Nonetheless, further improvements are urgently required regarding
the accuracy and timeliness of information on foreign financed capital expenditures.

- 56 -

APPENDIX III

C. Monetary Accounts
The existing data compilation framework conforms to the methodology recommended in the
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual, and data are compiled on a timely basis.
Following the multisector statistics mission’s recommendation to expand the coverage of
monetary statistics to include the accounts of the savings and credit associations (SCAs), in
2002, Parliament passed a law providing the necessary authority to the Bank of Albania
(BoA) to request the required data from the SCAs. There are currently about 130 SCAs
throughout the country and they report data to the BoA using a simplified report form.
The new plan of accounts for the commercial banks has been implemented. The commercial
banks started reporting balance sheet data to the BoA in June 1999 on revised reporting
forms prepared by the BoA. The money and banking statistics mission of November 1999
assisted the BoA in revising the reporting forms with a view to reducing the reporting burden
of the commercial banks and ensuring consistency of the data reported to the various
departments of the BoA. Efforts were being made to extend the time series of monetary data
on a consistent basis.
The authorities have revised the monetary accounts of the BoA, the commercial banks, and
the monetary survey from February 2001 onward to properly record the repurchase and
reverse repurchase agreements. The revised data were first published in the October 2002
issue of IFS. The authorities are also making efforts to revise the historical data.
D. Balance of Payments
The data compiled by the BoA are methodologically sound, although some of the estimates
need to be refined. The BoA has established data compilation procedures based on the
classification system of the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. The BoA
reports quarterly data to STA on a regular and timely basis. The BoA revised the
methodology for the measurement of tourism services, principally through the introduction
of surveys of travelers.
While this should improve the measurement of tourism services, further refinements are
required. More generally, problems remain in the areas of service transactions and
remittances, and in the monitoring of financial account transactions, foreign assistance and
external debt. These problems could be addressed by strengthening existing data sources and
improving estimation methods. The November 2004 technical assistance mission noted that
the coverage and accuracy of the data should be improved through the strengthening of the
legal framework and the use of the banks reporting system to verify data from enterprises
surveys. It also recommended incorporating the results of the direct investment survey as
well as investigation and follow up of the net errors and omissions observed at the level of
individual reporting banks. The Albanian authorities have not yet initiated compiling data on
foreign currency liquidity in line with the Data Template on International Reserves and
Foreign Currency Liquidity. While the definition of data on official reserve assets in
principle is consistent with that of the data Template, the data may not be adequate for

- 57 -

APPENDIX III

monitoring the economy because other foreign currency assets and currency drains are not
included.
E. External Debt Statistics
External debt statistics for government and government-guaranteed debt are compiled by the
Ministry of Finance (MoF). These data are generally good. The MoF’s external debt
database, developed with technical assistance from UNCTAD, became fully operational in
mid-2000. The external debt database ensures timely and accurate reporting of external
government debt (including commitments of state-owned enterprises). However, the
coverage of external debt data could be improved. There have been some irregularities in the
presentation and recording of old external arrears. The External Debt Committee needs to
work to improve coordination to ensure the timely and accurate reporting of the stock of
external arrears and changes resulting from rescheduling agreements. The authorities did
make an attempt to collect data on private sector external debt albeit limited to foreign direct
investment enterprises.

APPENDIX IV

DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Albania’s external debt sustainability has strengthened significantly in the past ten
years. Rapid growth, cautious public indebtedness policies, and debt restructuring have
allowed a continuous decrease in the debt-to-GDP ratio and debt-to-exports ratio (both in
NPV and nominal terms). Over the medium-term, external indebtedness is projected to
decline as a share of GDP, with the projected total debt service-to-exports ratio remaining at
manageable levels, between 5 and 7 percent. This outcome appears fairly robust to several
stress scenarios. It is sensitive, however, to an adverse export shock (of one historical
standard deviation) at the beginning of the projection period. This is partly due to the high
historical volatility of export growth in Albania (the standard deviation during 1996–2003
was 39.5 percentage points compared to the average growth of 23.3 percent). But this result
also highlights the need to significantly raise and diversify exports as a way to improve
economic growth potential, and reduce external vulnerability and dependence on migrant
remittances and other transfers from abroad. Other bound tests also impact negatively on
debt sustainability ratios compared to the baseline but not to the extent of compromising debt
sustainability in the long run.
The ratio of total public debt to GDP has been steadily declining and is projected to be
55 percent at end-2004 compared with 72 percent in 2000. In 2003-2004 the debt ratios
declined at a faster pace thanks to the accounting effect of the lek appreciation. The baseline
scenario is based on the continuation of current patterns of indebtedness and incorporates a
gradual switch to less concessional credit sources.
The most significant risk to total public debt sustainability pertains to the case of a
shortfall in growth. The stress test based on a one standard deviation decline in the real
growth rate in 2005 and 2006 indicates a 17 percentage points of GDP increase in the NPV
of debt stock relative to the baseline scenario. While this is a very stringent test due to the
high standard deviation of the historical growth rate (6.4 percent) and the assumption of no
fiscal response, it also helps underline the importance of sustained growth in keeping the
debt burden manageable. None of the other stress tests and alternative scenarios result in an
increase in the NPV of debt stock of more than 5 percent of GDP in the five year projection
period, implying an end-2009 debt stock about or below its 2003 level.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.

Tirana, February 3, 2005
Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Mr. de Rato:
The Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement, approved in June 2002,
has been instrumental in promoting macroeconomic stability and economic growth, and
improving governance in Albania.
All quantitative and structural performance criteria under the program have been observed.
We request completion of the fifth review as well as the financing assurances review under
the arrangement. We also request a five-month extension of the program until November
2005 in order to allow the sixth program review and final disbursement to take place within
the program period.
The attached supplementary Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) and
the Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) describe our economic program for
the period ahead. These policies are consistent with our November 2001 National Strategy
for Socio-Economic Development (NSSED) and the Annual Progress Reports of May 2003
and May 2004.
We believe that the policies set forth in the attached MEFP are adequate to achieve the
objectives of the program, but will take any further measures that may become appropriate
for this purpose. Albania will consult with the IMF prior to the adoption of any such
measures and of revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP, in accordance with the
IMF's policies on such consultations.
Moreover, after the end of this arrangement and while Albania has outstanding financial
obligations to the IMF arising from loan disbursements under this arrangement, Albania will
consult with the IMF from time to time on economic and financial policies, at the initiative of
the government or the Bank of Albania or whenever the Managing Director of the IMF
requests such consultation. These consultations may include correspondence and visits of
officials of the IMF to Albania or of representatives of Albania to the IMF. In continuing

- 65 -

with our policy of transparency, we consent to the publication of this letter, the attached
MEFP, and the accompanying Executive Board documents on the IMF’s website.

Sincerely yours,

APPENDIX V

Supplementary Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) for Albania
I. BACKGROUND
1.
This memorandum reviews the implementation of the PRGF-supported
program, updates the macroeconomic framework for 2004–07, and lays out our
policies for the remainder of the program period. It is consistent with the
November 2001 National Strategy for Socio-Economic Development (NSSED) and the
May 2003 and May 2004 Progress Reports; and supplements the June 2002, January 2003,
June 2003, January 2004, and July 2004 MEFPs.
II. PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PROGRAM
2.
The Albanian economy continued to register strong, non-inflationary growth in
2004, underpinned by firm macroeconomic policies and ongoing structural reforms.
We estimate output growth at 6 percent in 2004, led by rising retail trade and other
services—partially due to higher tourism—and by agricultural and electricity production
boosted by favorable weather and sectoral restructuring. Ongoing fiscal consolidation, firm
monetary policy, and improved supply of agricultural products held price increases to the
lower end of our 2-4 percent target range in the second half of the year. Largely due to
trade gains, we now expect a current account deficit of 7 percent of GDP, a full percentage
point of GDP lower than our projection at the time of the last review—representing a
considerable improvement given the substantial increase in oil import prices.1 Confidence
in the lek has increased further, as the currency component of broad money continued to
decline and the exchange rate to appreciate, despite a 50 basis point reduction in the Bank
of Albania (BoA) policy rate and the accumulation of an additional US$234 million of
reserves in the second half of the year. Some indicators of absolute poverty have improved
due to high growth, remittances, selected social assistance programs, and micro credit
programs. Real incomes have risen rapidly, and improvements have been registered in such
basic indicators as life expectancy, child mortality, maternal health, literacy, and gender
equality. However, service provision to the more vulnerable groups in our country, will
need to be strengthened.
3.
Despite shortfalls in budgeted resources, we stayed the course of fiscal
consolidation, meeting targeted reductions in domestic borrowing through
expenditure reduction, substantially outperforming the programmed deficit, and
achieving a 5½ percentage point of GDP reduction in public debt—which stood at
55½ percent of GDP at end-2004. The 2004 outturn for total revenue and grants was 1¾

MEFPs, use as their base the revised GDP series published by INSTAT in September 2004.

- 67 -

APPENDIX V

percentage points of GDP below budget. While tax revenue increased relative to 2003 due
to higher receipts from VAT, corporate income tax, excise rate increases, and other
revenue-enhancing tax policy measures, it fell somewhat short of budget projections.
Nontax revenue and financing sources undershot budgeted levels owing to shortfalls in
external grants and reduced central bank profit transfers. The latter resulted from lower
interest rates and sterilized intervention. Finally, the envisaged privatization of ARMO had
to be postponed and some development loan disbursements failed to materialize. However,
we met our domestic borrowing target under the program as we offset these budget
resource shortfalls through commensurate measures to reduce expenditure by about 3
percentage points of GDP relative to the budget—mainly on the capital budget but also
including savings in personnel and interest costs. Our underlying domestic borrowing
requirement declined by 0.2 percentage point of GDP with respect to 2003 and was further
reduced by 0.7 percentage point of GDP through the use of half of the Savings Bank
privatization proceeds to retire treasury bills, as agreed under the program. Also, the
overall deficit was about 1 percentage point of GDP below the programmed level.
4.
Without allowing the mid-2005 elections to distract us from the path of fiscal
consolidation, we have adopted a strong 2005 budget consistent with further declines
in public debt, domestic borrowing, and current expenditure. In light of past
experience, the budget is based on a realistic projection of revenue, similar to the 2004
revenue outturn. The accompanying fiscal package that implements most FAD technical
assistance (TA) recommendations. Representing a significant improvement in transparency
and budget process, the budget was sent to Parliament accompanied by a detailed list of
investment programs and the updated medium-term budget framework (MTBP2), all of
which were published along with the fiscal package on our official website prior to the
parliamentary debate and discussed widely with stakeholders.
5.
We have improved the performance of the customs administration and are
advancing in the reform of other fiscal institutions. After the deployment of the
ASYCUDA system in the Tirana and Durrës customs houses in time for the fourth review
of the program, we have continued expanding the coverage of the system. We drastically
reduced rotation of personnel, particularly at the managerial level; and stepped up training.
As a result, the average customs clearance period has declined from more than 5 days in
2003 to less than 2 days and seizure of smuggled goods and cases submitted to the public
prosecutor have increased sharply—the latter by more than 500 percent. Regarding the
General Directorate of Taxes (GDT), the improvement in outcomes has been weaker but
we have passed several pieces of legislation (mainly as part of the 2005 fiscal package) and
approved regulations that will significantly strengthen procedures, including appeals, VAT
refunds, and control of the individual income tax. With bilateral TA, we are improving our
treasury and debt management systems.

APPENDIX V

6.
We have continued to direct monetary policy towards maintaining price stability
and strengthening the financial sector and its prudential supervisory framework. In
the absence of inflationary pressures, the BoA has continued its easing stance through
successive reductions in the repo rate while maintaining tight monetary conditions partly
prompted by the strength of the lek. Foreign exchange market interventions have aimed at
smoothing exchange rate fluctuations and preserving reserve cover—about 4 months of
imports at end-2004. After the privatization of the Savings Bank, the whole commercial
banking system is under private management and is showing welcome dynamism. We
continued to improve and expand our banking supervisory and AML/CFT capacity, with
the help of MFD and World Bank assistance. The inter-bank real-time gross settlement
system (AIPS) and its associated intra-day credit facility, introduced in 2004, are
functioning well and we have prepared legislation that will establish the evidential value of
electronic signatures. We are advancing in our plans to pay government employees through
the banking system. We met the end-December 2004 structural performance criterion of
paying 10,000 employees through the banking system, and we are fully committed to a
rapid expansion of these numbers. We amended the Insurance Law to permit foreign
citizens to sit on the boards of Albanian insurance companies—thus, facilitating foreign
investment in the industry—and introduced “fit and proper” requirements for vetting
managers and board members.
7.
We continued our determined implementation of the privatization agenda and
sectoral restructuring, and made progress in other structural reforms. We concluded
the sale of Savings Bank and advanced our privatization program in strategic areas by
completing the initial stage in which we solicited internationally expressions of interest in
the sale of Albtelekom and ARMO; and abolished Albtelekom’s monopoly on international
telecommunication connections. We completed the pre-privatization sale of a stake in
INSIG to the IFC and EBRD, and with their collaboration are restructuring the company.
Results achieved in rationalizing the energy sector under KESH’s Action Plan, carried out
with World Bank assistance, have been encouraging. Electricity production has increased
significantly for the second year in a row, collection rates have improved, and technical
losses were reduced, resulting in a financial profit in 2004. This allowed the elimination of
the subsidy for electricity imports in the 2005 budget as scheduled under the action plan.
We have implemented a subsidy to low-income electricity consumers (incorporated in their
electricity bill) to shield them from tariff increases. We made progress in reconciling interenterprise arrears—concerned enterprises have signed memorandums of understanding
covering arrears incurred in 2002-03, and most of these have already been cleared. We
enacted the new law on statistics, published national accounts for 2002, and revised the
estimates for previous years, in accordance with the plan drafted with STA TA.

APPENDIX V

III. POLICIES AND MEASURES FOR JANUARY-DECEMBER 2005
A. Overall Strategy
8. We remain committed to our growth and poverty-reduction strategy. We will
continue to direct monetary and fiscal policy towards ensuring macroeconomic stability.
But looking forward, we believe that maintaining the current growth pace will also require
attracting high quality domestic and foreign investment to improve productivity and
competitiveness. Improving the investment climate is therefore an important precondition
that will require not only significant improvements in infrastructure but also our full
commitment to entrenching the rule of law, strengthening institutions, and improving
governance—including by stepping up our fight against corruption. We expect that
ongoing reforms of our revenue and budget institutions will generate the additional
resources needed to fund this investment and expand essential poverty-reducing services
without rekindling inflation or generating an unsustainable debt profile. Our strategy will
require broad-based support and we will continue to deepen our policy dialogue with all
stakeholders.
B. Macroeconomic Outlook
9.
Against the background of macroeconomic stability and progress in structural
reforms, non-inflationary growth of 6 percent can be sustained—initially by buoyant
domestic demand, but then increasingly by gains in productivity and export volumes.
Despite higher-than-envisaged oil prices, the current account is expected to improve
slightly in 2005 driven by rising exports, with further improvements over the medium term.
We expect public and private domestic savings to increasingly replace foreign savings in
financing a rise in investment over the medium term—facilitated by an expansion of
financial intermediation.
C. Fiscal Policy
10.
The 2005 budget envisages further reductions in public debt and in the
underlying domestic borrowing requirement (before privatization) through
substantial savings in current spending—thus buttressing the sustainability of our
public finances and allowing the non-inflationary expansion of private sector credit.
Current expenditure is projected to decrease by a further 0.9 percentage points of GDP—
mainly as a consequence of reduced subsidies, wage bill, and operational costs—while
protecting social expenditures. As a consequence, current revenues will suffice to fund
current outlays for the first time since the beginning of the transition process—that is,
borrowing and privatization proceeds will be devoted only to investment. We expect our
domestic borrowing requirement to be 2.7 percentage points of GDP in 2005, about 0.2

- 70 -

APPENDIX V

percentage points of GDP lower than domestic borrowing in 2004 before the use of the
Savings Bank proceeds to retire debt. Our stock of public debt will decline by a further 0.8
percentage points to 54.5 percent of GDP—17 percentage points down from its level in
2000. The receipts from the privatization of Albtelekom and the sale of the remaining
public stake in INSIG have not been included in the budget owing to uncertainty as to their
amount and timing. However we intend to privatize these companies as soon as feasible
and will allocate the proceeds of their privatization in equal parts to domestic debt
redemption and investment in priority areas.
11.
Savings in current expenditure will allow an expansion of infrastructure and
poverty-reducing investment, significantly contributing to our growth and poverty
reduction efforts. With the decline in current expenditure broadly matched by an
expansion in capital expenditure, we will be able to increase allocations on infrastructure
and poverty-alleviating investment by about 0.7 percentage points of GDP relative to 2004.
Moreover, as the budget is predicated on prudent revenue projections, we expect to avoid
the haphazard end-year expenditure cuts that have characterized budget implementation in
the past. This will provide security of funding to our line ministries and lay the foundation
for improvements in budget planning and prioritization.
12.
We have introduced tax reforms to streamline the tax system and reduce
distortions and will press ahead with the reform of the revenue administration.
•

The 2005 fiscal package eliminated the deduction of social insurance contributions
from the base for personal income tax; reduced the number of personal income tax
brackets; and subjected to VAT the first sale of residential buildings, effective 2006.
To stimulate investment, the fiscal package reduced the corporate income tax rate
from 25 to 23 percent in 2005 and to 20 percent in 2006, with the projected
0.15 percent of GDP cost in 2005 offset through savings in other areas. We have
introduced individual income tax returns and filing requirements that will be
gradually applied to those groups with the highest noncompliance risk. We are
eliminating the requirement for small businesses to renew their registration with the
GDT every year.

•

In the General Directorate of Customs (GDC) we will extend the ASYCUDA
system to a total of 5 customs houses (PC; end-March 2005), representing more than
75 percent of all customs traffic. We will also implement the ASYCUDA module for
risk assessment to trigger inspections in 5 customs houses, including in Tirana and
Durrës (PC; end-March 2005), significantly reducing officers’ room for discretion. In
light of the assessment carried out by the EU Customs Assistance Mission in Albania
(CAM-A), we will also develop and issue a new set of instructions to the customs
warehouses in order to unify the different procedures currently being applied and to
strengthen the existing controls against smuggling and other illegal activities.

•

As to the GDT, we have introduced accrual of interest on tax refunds overdue more
than 60 days; and have reduced from 6 to 3 months the carry forward period before
which application for VAT credit refunds can be made. For low-risk exporters we

- 71 -

APPENDIX V

will implement a system of rapid VAT refunds, with audits carried out ex post
according to risk assessment methods (PC; end-June 2005). We will also clear in
2005 overdue VAT refunds originated prior to June 2004, estimated at lek
700 million—an amount that has been included in the 2005 budget VAT revenue
projection. We will earmark each quarter an amount equal to 1 percent of the VAT
collected during the previous quarter for paying overdue VAT refunds until the stock
or arrears is eliminated (SB; ongoing). We will provide quarterly reports on this
matter (SB; ongoing). Concerning current requests for VAT refunds, we will also
provide quarterly reports on the aggregate amount of such refunds requested, refunds
paid, and refunds rejected (SB; ongoing) We will advance the process of
computerization by implementing the software modules for excises and national taxes
in the second and third quarters of 2005 respectively. By the end of 2005, we expect
15 branches to be fully computerized, covering 80 percent of all taxpayers and
95 percent of tax collections. We are in the process of receiving FAD TA on tax
administration to update our reform agenda and expand the use of information
technology.
13.
We will carry out measures to improve our budget process and raise the
efficiency and transparency of expenditure. We will continue the practice of including a
prioritized list of investment projects and the updated MTBP in future budget submissions
to Parliament. In 2006, we also plan to include projections of recurrent costs of proposed
investment programs as part of the budget documents. We have reduced the maximum
allowable transfer between budget appropriations to 5 percent for the 2005 fiscal year. We
are working towards a wage structure in the public sector that promotes efficiency and
allows the retention of skilled personnel. For 2005, we will discontinue across-the-board
public sector wage increases and instead allocate the wage bill increase to raise the pay of
workers in education, health and other priority areas, and skilled specialists; and to fund the
civil service reform designed with World Bank assistance. We will formally repeal the
existing automatic price indexation of wages prior to presentation of the 2006 budget. Over
the course of 2005, we will enhance expenditure control and monitoring by extending the
treasury automation system to regional branches and increase the use of the banking system
in budgetary transactions.
14.
Our fiscal policies over the medium term will continue consolidating the public
finances aiming at offsetting the likely decline in concessional assistance, while
undertaking preparations to access international capital markets. In 2006–07, we
intend to reduce domestic borrowing further in order to crowd in private sector credit and
maintain the declining trend in public debt. We remain committed to improving revenue
mobilization and combating tax noncompliance. In order to keep budget revenue
projections prudent and conservative, we have not included revenue gains from tax
administration improvements in the 2005 budget. However, we expect these gains to
materialize and become sizable over the medium term. In addition, as output grows, we
plan to reduce further the current expenditure share of GDP, thus generating a current
surplus to fund higher investment in priority areas. Nevertheless, investment projects with
high growth impact will continue to exceed domestic resources. Thus, in anticipation of an

- 72 -

APPENDIX V

eventual decline in foreign concessional assistance, we intend to begin preparations to
obtain a sovereign credit rating with a view to tap international capital markets. This would
also facilitate international financing for domestic private firms.
D. Monetary and Financial Sector Policies
15.
Monetary policy will continue to aim at keeping inflation within the 2–
4 percent target band of the BoA, while maintaining an adequate level of reserves. The
repo rate will remain our main policy instrument to ensure adherence to our monetary
program. Over the remainder of the program period, we expect a continuation of existing
trends: money demand will remain broadly stable as share of GDP; private sector credit
will grow rapidly from its low base; and the share of currency in broad money will
continue to decline, reflecting rising intermediation and confidence in the banking system.
We will maintain a flexible exchange rate regime, with foreign exchange interventions
used mainly for smoothing short-term shocks unrelated to fundamentals and for
maintaining a level of reserves broadly equivalent to 4 months of imports of goods and
services.
16.
We will continue reforms aimed at improving the efficiency, transparency, and
volume of banking sector intermediation and financial services. In this regard, we view
the upcoming FSAP exercise as a well-timed means of evaluating progress to date and of
refining further our reform agenda.
•

To deepen financial intermediation and combat the informal economy, we will
continue to foster the use of the banking system in the regular conduct of
business. We view the payment of public sector salaries through the banking system
as a catalyst for this process. We will increase the total number of public employees
paid in this manner to 25,000 by end-March 2005 (PC) and to 50,000 by end-June
2005 (PC). In consultation with the industry, we will implement an inter-bank bulk
clearing system for small transactions in 2005 to facilitate automated bill payments,
wage deposits, and other customer services.

•

Over the course of 2005, we intend to strengthen the market infrastructure and
legal framework underpinning our financial system in preparation for the
anticipated expansion of banking activity. We are considering options to increase
the depth of the T-bill market, such as extending participation in the market to large
nonfinancial firms and introducing market-making and brokerage arrangements. We
are also exploring the feasibility of developing additional financial markets, such as
foreign currency swaps and collateralized inter-bank money markets. The banking
law, currently in the drafting stage, will introduce greater clarity to the rules and
procedures governing the operation of commercial banks—including the powers of
the supervisory authority concerning receivership and conservatorship; as well as
mandating greater transparency and consumer protection. The Electronic Record Law
will establish the evidential value of electronic signatures. A draft of this law has

- 73 -

APPENDIX V

been prepared by the BoA with assistance from the World Bank and passage is
expected in 2005.
17.
We recognize that significant improvement in practices, standards,
transparency, and the effectiveness of supervision will be required in the insurance
sector to ensure its proper development. As first steps in this process, we have secured
resident advisors in the insurance regulatory agency and in INSIG. We anticipate that the
upcoming FSAP exercise will also be useful in identifying the broad direction of reform
and we will request additional TA as required in order to formulate a comprehensive
restructuring plan for this sector.
18.
We remain committed to support the integrity of our monetary framework
and the independence of the central bank. We will ensure that the BoA retains its policy
and operational autonomy, and we will take no legislative or regulatory action that
weakens its full control over the bank’s budget—including staff compensation levels—
currently exercised by the BoA’s Supervisory Board. As required by law, and to preserve
the integrity and independence of our central bank, the government will issue interestbearing securities to the BoA in the amount required to cover reserve valuation losses due
to the appreciation of the lek. Those corresponding to 2003 valuation losses, amounting to
Lek 7.7 billion, have already been issued; while those corresponding to 2004 valuation
losses—estimated at Lek 4 billion—will be issued in April 2005 following certification of
the 2004 BoA audited accounts. Although drawings under the Treasury’s overdraft facility
with BoA have been minimal, brief, and unconnected to the financing of the budget, we
intend to eliminate the facility gradually, as alternative commercial and market-based
options develop and the Treasury’s liquidity management capacity improves. Specifically,
we intend to reduce the statutory limit for the overdraft facility from its current level of
5 percent of budget revenues to 4.5 percent over the course of 2005 and then by a further
0.5 percent in each successive year.
E. Structural Policies
19.
The privatization agenda for 2005 includes Albtelekom and ARMO, as well as
our remaining minority stake in AMC and two commercial banks. We will strive to
privatize other publicly-owned companies such as SERVCOM and Albpetrol as rapidly as
feasible. In preparation for the sale of Albtelekom, we will fully regularize the company’s
outstanding financial obligations to private creditors; and institute reforms to the rural and
small operators regime along transparent lines and in accordance with international
standards. We will fully support the restructuring of INSIG—currently being carried out in
conjunction with its partial pre-privatization to EBRD and IFC—in preparation for its
eventual sale. We have started a pilot project to restructure four water companies, with
assistance from the World Bank and other donors, but further actions will be needed ensure
the viability of this sector.

- 74 -

APPENDIX V

20.
We will fully implement our 2005–07 action plan, with World Bank assistance,
to modernize KESH and restructure the electricity sector. We will keep a stabilization
fund with KESH’s profits in years with pluvial conditions to finance imports in less
favorable years, with the funds invested abroad, managed by a well-established
international financial firm, and audited regularly.
21.
We intend to implement a number of reforms aimed at enhancing governance,
efficiency, and transparency. We will carry out independent feasibility studies for large
projects funded by non-concessional borrowing (SB; ongoing) and subject them to open
tenders, except in exceptional circumstances such as in cases of national security. We will
continue to provide a quarterly listing and status report on all projects being considered for
nonconcessional foreign financing (SB; ongoing). We will continue implementing our
action plan for removing barriers to investment, and will carry out a survey to assess its
impact and update the plan accordingly. We have implemented the law on asset
declaration, and plan to proceed with the conflict of interest legislation. To improve
external assistance coordination, we have presented an integrated planning system to the
donor community and expect to implement an agreed methodology following a period of
dialogue.
F. External Policy
22.
We will retain our liberal trade regime. We aim at concluding a Stabilization and
Association Agreement with the EU and an eventual EU-Albania free trade agreement. On
a regional level, we have successfully concluded free trade agreements with BosniaHerzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Kosovo, FYR Macedonia, Moldova, Serbia and
Montenegro, and Romania. All agreements have been ratified by the respective parliaments
and trade volumes are rising rapidly, albeit from a low base—in the first half of 2004 the
share of these countries in total trade rose from 2.6 to 8.3 percent.
23.
We made progress in rescheduling our arrears on inoperative payments
agreements with official creditors (Article XIV) in 2004 and will continue these efforts
in 2005. The agreement with Hungary has been finalized and was implemented in the first
half of 2004. Balances due to the Czech and Slovak Republics, Poland, and Romania have
been reconciled. In the latter case, the terms of payment are already negotiated. We expect
to conclude agreements with these four countries in the first half of 2005. Although in
some of the remaining cases the process has been more protracted than expected, we still
strive to conclude this process by the end of the program with official creditors and by end2006 with private creditors.
G. Data Issues
24.
We are improving the quality and coverage of economic statistics in
cooperation with STA and other technical assistance partners. Building on the new

- 75 -

APPENDIX V

statistical law, we have signed memoranda of understanding for the provision of data
between INSTAT and other government institutions. We will present to Parliament our 5year statistical program (SB; March 2005). We will further improve the scope and
collection of data on FDI and remittances and accelerate the production of national
accounts. We will publish the preliminary 2003 national accounts by March 2005 (SB) and
introduce a pilot project on the preparation of quarterly GDP estimates by June 2005. We
plan to issue the 2004 national accounts, based on sampling techniques, by end-2005.
H. Program Monitoring
25.
The seventh disbursement under the PRGF-supported program will be based on the
end-March 2005 quantitative performance criteria (Table 1 and the TMU); the end–March
and end-June 2005 structural performance criteria (Table 2); and completion of the sixth
review and the financing assurances review. The sixth review is expected to be completed
no later than November 10, 2005. During the program period, Albania will not impose or
intensify restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions; or introduce multiple currency practices, or conclude bilateral payments
agreements inconsistent with Article VIII, or impose or intensify import restrictions for
balance of payments reasons. We will provide a new progress report on the NSSED by
April 2005, taking into account the recommendations of the joint staff assessment of
the 2004 progress report.

ATTACHMENT I

ALBANIA
TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
This memorandum defines the quantitative benchmarks and performance criteria established
in the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) for end-June 2004–endMarch 2005.
A. Net Domestic Credit to the Central Government
1.
For the purposes of the program, the central government covers the State Budget,
the Social Security Institute (SSI), and the Health Insurance Institute (HII).
2.
Net domestic credit to the central government (NCG) is defined as gross domestic
credit in lek and in foreign currency extended to the central government (as defined above)
by the banking system, savings and loan institutions (SLIs), and other domestic lenders;1 less
the sum of central government financial assets held in the banking system and in the SLIs.
3.
The following definitions apply to gross domestic credit to the central
government:

1

(i)

Gross domestic credit in lek and in foreign currency extended to the
central government includes: (a) securities (including treasury bills and
bonds) issued by the central government and held by the Bank of Albania
(BoA), deposit money banks (DMBs), SLIs, and other domestic lenders; (b)
loans and advances extended to the central government by BoA, DMBs, SLIs,
and other domestic lenders; and (c) negative balances in government deposits
with BoA, DMBs and SLIs.

(ii)

Gross domestic credit in lek and in foreign currency extended to the
central government excludes (a) the onlending of foreign project loans to all
parts of central government; and (b) advances on profit transfers by the BoA.
The value of the stock of gross domestic credit to government will also
exclude the claims held by the units of central government as defined above
(in particular, the SSI and the HII).

(iii)

The stock of gross domestic credit extended to the central government and
held by the BoA and DMBs in the form of treasury bills will be valued at
issue price. The stock of gross domestic credit extended to the central
government and held by the BoA in the form of other securities and direct

Other domestic lenders comprise both firms (including insurance companies) and
households. For small lenders, treasury bill windows are available at the central bank and at
selected Albapost offices throughout the country.

- 79 -

APPENDIX V
ATTACHMENT I

loans to government will be valued excluding accrued interest. The stock of
gross domestic credit extended to the central government and held by the
DMBs in the form of fixed and variable income securities will be valued at
face value. The stock of all gross domestic credit extended to the central
government and held by SLIs and other domestic lenders will be valued at
face value2.
4.
The following definitions apply to central government financial assets held in the
banking system and in the SLIs:
(i)
Central government financial assets held at the Bank of Albania
include: (a) transferable deposits in domestic and foreign currency; (b) lek
deposits held in BoA for projects; and (c) standard gold deposits of the central
government. For the purposes of program monitoring, standard gold deposits
will be valued at the program price of gold (SDR 280.6 per ounce)3.
(ii)
Central government financial assets held at the Bank of Albania
exclude: (a) foreign currency deposits related to foreign financed projects;
and (b) deposits serving as the counterpart for non-standard gold and other
precious metals owned by the central government.
(iii) Central government financial assets held at the DMBs include: (a)
all deposits of central government in domestic and foreign currency; (b) all
loans extended by central government to commercial banks; and (c) payable
amounts owed by the DMB to central government.
(iv)
Central government financial assets held at the SLIs include all
deposits of central government held at the SLIs.
5.
For the purposes of program monitoring, central government financial assets in
foreign currency will be converted from Lek to SDRs at the end-of period Lek/SDR
exchange rate prevailing on the test date; and then converted to Lek at the end-December
2003 Lek/SDR exchange rate of Lek158.1/SDR.
2

Under current reporting standards, the following data is only available at face value: (i) the
stock of gross domestic credit extended to the central government and held by the DMBs in
the form of fixed and variable income securities; and (ii) the stock of all gross domestic
credit extended to the central government and held by the SLIs and other domestic lenders.
3

The lek value of standard gold deposits will be (a) converted to US dollars using the current
end-of-period lek/US dollar exchange rate; (b) then converted to ounces of gold using the
current US dollar market price of gold; (c) then converted to SDRs at the program price of
gold (SDR 280.6 per ounce); and (d) then converted to Lek at the program Lek/SDR
exchange rate of Lek 158.1104/SDR.

- 80 -

APPENDIX V
ATTACHMENT I

6.
The breakdown of the categories of net domestic credit to the central government as
defined above is given in Attachment Table 1.
7.
The limits on the change in net domestic credit to the government will be cumulative
from end-December 2004.
B. Net Domestic Assets
8.
The stock of net domestic assets (NDA) of the Bank of Albania are defined as the
difference between reserve money—defined as the sum of currency issue (less lek notes and
coins held by the Bank of Albania) and commercial bank reserves held at the BoA—less the
net international reserves of the Bank of Albania (Section C), with all foreign currency assets
and liabilities valued in local currency for program monitoring purposes at an exchange rate
at end-December 2003. Under this definition, the level of the NDA was Lek 72 billion as of
end-December 2003. The NDA limits will be cumulative changes from end-December 2003
and will be monitored from the accounts of the Bank of Albania.
C. Net International Reserves
9.
Net international reserves (NIR) are defined as reserve assets minus reserve
liabilities of the Bank of Albania. Reserve assets are readily available claims of the Bank of
Albania on nonresidents denominated in foreign convertible currencies, and held for the
purpose of meeting balance of payments financing needs, intervention in exchange markets,
and other purposes. They include Bank of Albania holdings of monetary gold, SDRs,
Albania’s reserve position in the IMF, foreign currency cash, and deposits abroad. Excluded
from reserve assets are any assets that are pledged, collateralized, or otherwise encumbered;
claims on residents; precious metals other than monetary gold; assets in nonconvertible
currencies; illiquid assets; and claims on foreign exchange arising from derivatives in foreign
currencies vis-à-vis domestic currency (such as futures, forwards, swaps, and options).
Reserve liabilities shall be defined as foreign exchange liabilities to residents and
nonresidents of the Bank of Albania, irrespective of their maturity. They include: foreign
currency reserves of commercial banks held at the Bank of Albania; all credit outstanding
from the IMF; commitments to sell foreign exchange arising from derivatives (such as
futures, forwards, swaps, and options); and all arrears on principal or interest payments to
commercial banks, suppliers, or official export credit agencies. Excluded from reserve
liabilities are the government’s foreign currency deposits at the Bank of Albania.4 Reserve
assets and reserve liabilities will both be expressed in U.S. dollars.

4

This exclusion is justified by current procedures in Albania, whereby the government's
foreign currency receipts are deposited in a blocked account at the Bank of Albania and the
funds are transferred to the government’s lek account before being spent. A change in this
procedure, would require revisiting the NIR definition.

- 81 -

APPENDIX V
ATTACHMENT I

10.
During this program, for monitoring purposes, the exchange rates of the SDR and
non-dollar currencies will be kept at their end-December 2003 levels and holdings of
monetary gold will be valued at SDR 280.6 per ounce. Excluded from gross international
reserves are holdings of nonconvertible currencies, claims on nonresident financial
institutions denominated in nonconvertible currencies, and other claims which are not readily
available.
D. Adjusters for NCG, NDA, and NIR
11.
The NCG and NDA ceilings and the NIR floor are defined on the assumption that
total privatization proceeds (privatization proceeds received in foreign currency) will
amount, on a cumulative basis, from January 1, 2004, to:
End-March 2005
End-June 2005

Lek 15.9 billion, (US$138.5 million).
Lek 16.0 billion, (US$138.5 million).

The NIR floor will be adjusted upward (downward) and the NDA ceiling adjusted downward
(upward) by half of any excess (shortfall) in the receipt of privatization proceeds in foreign
currency from these assumed values. The NCG ceiling will be adjusted downward (upward)
by half the amount of any excess (shortfall) in the receipt of total privatization proceeds from
these assumed values.
12.
The ceilings on NCG and NDA, and the floor on NIR are defined based on the
assumption that foreign budgetary and/or balance of payments loan financing (excluding
IMF financing, project and commodity loans, and macro-financial assistance from the EU)
will amount, on a cumulative basis, from January 1, 2004, to:
End-March 2005
End-June 2005

US$ 19.0 million.
US$ 29.0 million.

In cases where total foreign loan financing exceeds this projection, the ceilings on NCG to
the government and NDA of the Bank of Albania will be adjusted downward, and the floor
on NIR will be adjusted upward by the amount of the excess5.
13.
The NDA ceilings will be also adjusted to reflect the impact of any change in the
required reserve ratio of commercial banks with the Bank of Albania.
E. External Debt and Arrears
14.
As set forth in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to
Foreign Debt (Decision No. 12274–00/85) August 24, 2000), the term “debt” will be

For the NCG adjuster, the lek equivalent of deviations from the programmed amounts in
terms of dollars is converted at an exchange rate of Lek 106.5 per U.S. dollar.

understood to mean a current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual
arrangement through the provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or
services, and which requires the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets
(including currency) or services, at some future point(s) in time; these payments will
discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts can take a
number of forms, the primary ones being as follows: (i) loans, i.e., advances of money to
obligor by the lender made on the basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the
funds in the future (including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans and buyers’
credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans
under which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by
repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and
official swap arrangements); (ii) suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits
the obligor to defer payments until some time after the date on which the goods are delivered
or services are provided; and (iii) leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided
which the lessee has the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are
usually shorter than the total expected service life of the property, while the lessor retains the
title to the property. For the purpose of the guideline, the debt is the present value (at the
inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the
agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair or maintenance of the
property. Arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make
payment under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make
payment on an obligation that is not considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on
delivery) will not give rise to debt.
15.
The limit on medium- and long-term external debt applies to the contracting or
guaranteeing by the central government or the Bank of Albania, of new nonconcessional
external debt with an original maturity of more than one year, with sub-limits on external
debt with an original maturity of more than one year and up to and including five years. It
applies not only to debt as defined in paragraph 14 of this memorandum, but also to
commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been received. External debt
will be considered to have been contracted at the point the loan agreement or guarantee is
ratified by the Albanian parliament. Excluded from the limits are refinancing credits and
rescheduling operations (including the deferral of interest on commercial debt), credits
extended by the IMF, and credits on concessional terms defined as those with a grant element
of at least 35 percent. The grant element is to be calculated using the OECD Commercial
Interest Reference Rates (CIRRs): for maturities of less than 15 years, the grant element will
be calculated based on six-month averages of CIRRs; and for maturities longer than 15 years,
the grant element will be calculated based on ten-year averages. Debt falling within the limit
shall be valued in U.S. dollars at the exchange rate prevailing at the time the contract or
guarantee becomes effective.
16.
The limit on short-term external debt applies on a continuous basis to the stock of
short-term external debt owed or guaranteed by the central government or the Bank of
Albania, with an original maturity of up to and including one year. It applies to debt as
defined in paragraph 14 of this memorandum. Excluded from the limit are rescheduling

- 83 -

APPENDIX V
ATTACHMENT I

operations (including the deferral of interest on commercial debt) and normal import-related
credits. Debt falling within the limit shall be valued in U.S. dollars at the exchange rate
prevailing at the time the contract or guarantee becomes effective.
17.
A continuous performance criterion applies to the non-accumulation of new external
payments arrears on external debt contracted or guaranteed by the central government or
the Bank of Albania. External payment arrears consist of external debt service obligations
(principal and interest) falling due after March 31, 2002 and that have not been paid at the
time they are due, as specified in the contractual agreements. Excluded from the prohibition
on the accumulation of new arrears are: (i) arrears arising from interest on the stock of
arrears outstanding as of March 31, 2002; and (ii) external arrears that are subject to debt
rescheduling agreements or negotiations.
18.
Large projects (as referred to in MEFP paragraph 21 and Table 2) financed by
nonconcessional foreign borrowing are defined as those projects involving total
nonconcessional foreign borrowing in excess of US$25 million.
F. Tax Revenues
19.
Collection of total tax revenue by the Tax and Customs Departments and social
insurance contributions will be monitored on the basis of quarterly indicative floors. These
indicative floors will include all revenues collected by the GDT, GDC, and SSI (including
revenues collected on behalf of local governments), but exclude revenues collected by local
governments directly.
G. Monitoring and Reporting Requirements
Performance under the program will be monitored from information supplied monthly to the
Fund by the Bank of Albania, the Ministry of Finance, the General Directorate of Taxation
(GTD), the General Directorate of Customs (GDC), and the Ministry of Economy. This

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Completes Fifth Review Under PRGF Arrangement with Albania
and Approves US$6.1 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the fifth review
of Albania's economic performance under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
arrangement. In doing so, the Board also approved a request for an extension of the PRGF
arrangement period from June 20, 2005 to November 20, 2005. The Board’s decision enables
Albania to draw an amount equivalent to SDR 4 million (about US$6.1 million), which will
bring total disbursements under the arrangement to the equivalent of SDR 24 million
(about US$36.6 million). The Executive Board also completed a financing assurances review.
The three-year PRGF arrangement was approved on June 21, 2002 (see News Brief No. 02/52)
for a total of SDR 28 million (about US$42.7 million).
Following the Executive Board's discussion of Albania, Ms. Anne O. Krueger, First Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“Albania’s macroeconomic performance so far during the third year of the government’s
PRGF-supported economic program has been commendable. Growth has remained robust,
inflation generally has been low, the current account deficit has declined, and the lek has
strengthened reflecting increased confidence. A firm monetary policy stance, continued fiscal
consolidation, privatization, and progress in structural reforms have underpinned this
performance.
“Economic growth is expected to remain robust in 2005 and over the medium term, supported
increasingly by productivity and external trade gains. However, maintaining this growth
performance will require significant improvements in infrastructure and in the investment
climate, including reforms to strengthen governance, property rights protection, and the rule of
law.
“The financial sector has become increasingly dynamic since the privatization of the Savings
Bank. The Bank of Albania is appropriately supporting the development of the financial sector
and stepping up prudential vigilance. In this connection, the program includes steps to expand
the financial infrastructure and to curtail the use of cash, including by paying public wages

-2-

through the banking system. A financial sector assessment is to be undertaken shortly to help
chart the course of further reforms and build prudential supervisory capacity.
“The fiscal component of the program is consistent with the 2005 budget and envisages further
fiscal consolidation and improvements in the composition of budgetary spending. The program is
based on realistic assumptions about revenue, and envisages a surplus in the current balance in
order to free resources for public investment. In addition, the reduction in the underlying
domestic borrowing requirement aims at allowing the expansion of credit to the private sector,
without triggering inflation, and maintaining the public debt on a downward trend.
“The program also envisages progress in structural reforms to strengthen fiscal institutions,
improve governance, advance the privatization process further, and improve the business
climate,” Ms. Krueger said.
The PRGF is the IMF's most concessional facility for low-income countries. PRGF-supported
programs are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory
process involving civil society and development partners, and articulated in a Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP). This is intended to ensure that each PRGF-supported program is
consistent with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural, and social policies to
foster growth and reduce poverty. PRGF loans carry an annual interest rate of 0.5 percent, and
are repayable over 10 years with a 5½-year grace period on principal payments.

Statement by Pier Carlo Padoan, Executive Director for Albania and
Carlo Gola, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
February 28, 2005
At the outset, my authorities would like to express their appreciation for the valuable work
and collaboration with staff during the duration of the program that is now coming to a
conclusion.
1. Introduction
Albania has done well in the last years, progressively coming to what staff defines as a
“commendable performance.” In fact, this is perhaps the first time we are not discussing a
waiver. Albania has made remarkable progress since the 1997 crisis and the system has been
able to absorb shocks like the huge influx of refugees during the Kosovo war or the other one
in 2002, when 20 billion leks went out of the banking system in a matter of days.
2. A sound macroeconomic policy has generated strong results.
Few numbers represent well the results that authorities, with the collaboration of the Fund,
have achieved over the course of the programs.
•

Since 1997 the economic growth has been strong, averaging 7.5 percent annually for
the period from 1998 to 2004. In the same period per capita GDP increased almost
three times. GDP growth in 2004 reached 6 percent.

•

Between 1997 and 2004 public debt declined from 84.6 to 55.7 percent of GDP;
external debt has been reduced from 40.8 percent to 19.7 percent of GDP, over the
same period. In 2004, the current balance, for the first time since the transition, has
balanced, while the budget financing (including privatization receipts) has funded
capital expenditures, which reached, at the end of 2004, 4.62 percent of GDP.

•

Following a skillful conduct of monetary policy, inflation, since 2001, has been within
the limits set by the Bank of Albania, 2-4 percent. In 2004 average inflation was
2.9 percent, declining at the end of the year to 2.2 percent.

•

The Albanian economy continues to register strong growth rates supported by firm
macroeconomic policies and implementation of structural reforms. The authorities have
adopted a strong 2005 budget, committed to reducing public debt, domestic borrowing
and current expenditure, despite mid-2005 elections pressures. This budget and the
fiscal package accompanying it, are not only fully in line with staff recommendations
and advice, but have also been transparently and widely discussed with all stakeholders.
Conscious of the need to ensure fiscal sustainability, the authorities have improved the
performance of customs administration and are taking steps to further the reform in
other fiscal institutions. As we speak ASYCUDA is operating in 5 customs houses and
by the end of March, it will be installed in a sixth one, thus covering more than

•

-280 percent of the entire customs transactions. The authorities are extending the Civil
Service law to ensure a stable and supportive work environment to customs and tax
administration officials. A tender to equip two sensitive customs houses with the latesttechnology scanner system is under preparation, aimed at improving the quality of
controls and facilitating trade. In addition, authorities have applied, and hope to be
supported by the MCA program, for a Prime Advisor for the Tax administration.
3. Despite the success, the authorities are aware that many challenges remain.
Albanian authorities are aware of the numerous challenges to be faced. They are proud of the
achievements, but also fully aware that a long way remains to reach the standards of other
European countries. There is a need to improve the fiscal structure and discipline, and major
efforts need to be channeled to reduce the sizeable informal economy. Further efforts are
needed to enhance tax administration and expenditure management. The need for better
infrastructure will of course take up significant financial resources before allowing Albania
to fully exploit its geographical position as part of major regional networks. Further efforts
are required by the authorities in enforcing the rule of law and improving governance before
bringing the business climate indicators to regional levels. Authorities will have to cope with
poverty by firmly addressing the needs of different social groups and the disparities between
various areas in the country, and ensure that priorities set forth in the National Strategy for
Socio-Economic Development are duly matched in the Medium-Term Budget Program.
We visited Albania a few days ago, and had extensive discussions there with the authorities.
The speed of changes and the advancement of economic reforms in the country are
impressive. Albania has established a very good track record of sustainable economic growth
with low inflation, and has entered a path of sustainable fiscal consolidation. The banking
system is increasing its contribution to economic growth and private sector development.
While the active role of strategic investors has enhanced market competition in the financing
sector, the authorities are, as we speak, closely working with an IMF and WB team to
conduct a FSAP.
Let us assure you that the Albanian authorities are totally committed to continuing the
implementation of important policies and structural reforms. Reforming the public
administration, consolidating institutions and fighting corruption, enhancing accountability,
and improving governance are all items that lie well at the top of the government’s policy
agenda. In this regard, we find the program to have been an effective, and indeed quite
powerful, mechanism to support the consolidation of critical economic reforms.
4. Future engagement with the Fund.
To conclude, let us convey that the Albanian authorities believe that Albania is still some
distance away from graduating from Fund involvement. Despite improved macroeconomic
conditions, the country has not yet fully developed its policy implementation capabilities.
The authorities feel that Fund assistance and advice could play a key role in the design and
implementation of macroeconomic policies and reforms focusing on the budget and treasury
management and the banking sectors as well. This said, given the progress made in both

-3macroeconomic and structural sectors, authorities also feel that Albania must elaborate an
exit strategy that is sound, credible, and that demonstrates that policy decision and
implementation capacities have been significantly strengthened over the recent past, also
thanks to Fund support. Needless to say, enhancing ownership of the reform process is key
for a timely and successful exit strategy. For these reasons, the authorities believe that
Albania would benefit from another mid-term program with the Fund, the typology of which
will be discussed in due course.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Albania
On February 28, 2005 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the 2004 Article IV consultation with Albania.1
Background
The macroeconomic performance of the Albanian economy has been remarkable by both
regional and international standards. After a slowdown in 2002, economic growth recovered to
about 6 percent in 2003–04; inflation declined, generally remaining within the 2–4 percent target
range of the Bank of Albania; and the external current account deficit narrowed by almost 3
percentage points of GDP reflecting trade gains. The public debt-to-GDP ratio has been
reduced by 11½ percentage points to 55¼ percent in 2002-04 and confidence in the lek has
been restored, as reflected in its appreciating trend. Rising incomes underpinned progress
along some basic dimensions of poverty—although some education and health care indicators
have deteriorated. However, a self-sustained, across-the-board expansion of tradable output
has not yet taken root. At 23 percent of GDP in 2004, the external goods and services trade
deficit remains high, as does the economy’s dependence on migrant remittances and other
transfers from abroad. Poor transport, telecommunications, and other infrastructure and a weak
institutional environment are considered the main obstacles to investment.
The Bank of Albania’s tight monetary policy stance since early 2002 has prevailed on inflation
and buttressed confidence in the lek—against the backdrop of a strengthening banking sector.
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

1

-2With inflation subdued and the lek appreciating, the Bank of Albania’s policy interest rate has
gradually eased since 2002 to 5¼ percent, although monetary conditions have remained tight.
The successful privatization of the Savings Bank has revamped banking activity, supported by
the Bank of Albania’s provision of financial market infrastructure. Increased confidence and
interest rate differentials have supported an increase in deposits—mostly contributed by lek
deposits—and a reduction in the cash-to-broad money ratio. Foreign reserve cover was at a
comfortable four months of imports at end-2004.
The public finances have strengthened over the past few years but fiscal institutional reforms
have lagged behind. Budget and expenditure management were hindered by over-optimistic
budget revenue projections that, when they failed to materialize, prompted haphazard spending
cuts to meet financing targets. In 2004, after revised revenue and expenditure projections
during the fourth program review, domestic revenue has broadly met forecasts and budget
implementation has improved. However, shortfalls in external project-related financing and
grants prompted spending reductions and an overall deficit overperformance of 1¼ percentage
points of GDP relative to program. In 2004, the current budget was broadly balanced for the first
time since transition. The enacted 2005 budget embodies further fiscal consolidation and
savings on current spending—premised on a much improved revenue projection.
Some structural reforms gained momentum in 2004—notably privatization and sectoral
restructuring. The authorities have initiated the privatization of several public enterprises—
INSIG (insurance), Albtelecom (fixed-line telecom) and ARMO (refinery)—and are successfully
restructuring the electricity sector.
Albania has been engaged in a series of Fund-supported programs since the beginning of the
transition in 1992. The macroeconomic objectives of these programs were generally achieved
and financial policies were decisively implemented, fostering macroeconomic stability and
growth. The implementation of structural reforms was satisfactory overall, particularly in macrocritical areas, but the pace of the reforms was uneven. In addition, the achievements remained
fragile on account of pervasive poverty, lingering administrative capacity weaknesses, and slow
progress in improving governance.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Albania’s good macroeconomic performance in recent years,
observing that growth has been strong, inflation has generally remained low, and the current
account deficit, although still high, has declined. Moreover, confidence in the domestic currency
and the financial sector has firmed up. This favorable performance has been underpinned by
fiscal consolidation, a firm monetary policy stance, and progress in privatization and other
structural reforms. Directors cautioned, however, that a self-sustained broad-based expansion
of net exports has not yet taken root, and that the external balance remains dependent on
migrant remittances and other transfers which could be expected to decline over time.
Furthermore, although the number of people living in absolute poverty has declined, poverty
remains a key challenge.

-3Directors expected growth to continue at a brisk pace in 2005 and over the medium term.
They emphasized, however, that this outlook is contingent on improvements in governance and
the investment climate and on acceleration of the pace of reform, including in areas such as
property rights protection and law enforcement. Directors concurred that vulnerabilities are
limited by the moderate external indebtedness, but stressed that attainment of external
sustainability will depend on improving competitiveness and attracting strategic export-oriented
investment. Directors also pointed out that the possibility of softer demand in trading partner
countries poses risks to the outlook, particularly since the strength of the lek might have eroded
competitiveness in some sectors.
Directors were encouraged by the progress in building a sound monetary policy framework
based on a clear inflation and financial stability mandate of the Bank of Albania, central bank
independence, and a flexible exchange rate regime. With inflation within the Bank of Albania’s
target range, Directors considered that the gradual easing of the monetary policy stance since
2002 has been appropriate, and that the current neutral bias is warranted. Directors
emphasized that the Bank of Albania should avoid having any explicit or implicit exchange rate
target in its foreign exchange interventions, as monetary policy should remain focused on price
stability.
Directors welcomed the increased dynamism of the financial sector in the wake of the Savings
Bank privatization. They commended the authorities’ ongoing initiatives to deepen financial
intermediation and reduce the use of cash in the economy, and encouraged the authorities to
take measures to develop the treasury bill, foreign exchange, and interbank money markets.
Directors also noted the need to step up prudential vigilance in light of increasing credit to the
private sector and the level of dollarization. They urged the authorities to monitor closely the
health of the financial sector, and in this regard looked forward to the findings and
recommendations of the upcoming Financial Sector Assessment Program.
Directors commended the progress made in strengthening the public finances in recent years.
They welcomed the adoption of a 2005 budget that appropriately aims at further debt
retrenchment in anticipation of a likely decline of concessional assistance, and the authorities’
intention to use future large privatization proceeds solely for debt reduction and investment.
They supported the emphasis on curtailing current spending to a level commensurate with a
realistic projection of recurrent revenue, thus providing resources for investment. Directors also
welcomed the authorities’ commitment to refrain from across-the-board public wage increases
and to formally repeal wage indexation before the 2006 budget. They encouraged efforts to
build capacity in expenditure management and to monitor public investment.
Directors emphasized the importance of accelerating the reform of fiscal institutions and of
capacity building. They noted the steps taken in this direction in the 2005 fiscal package and
other ongoing initiatives. Priority also needs to be put on broader reform of tax administration to
boost tax compliance and mobilize revenue. A few Directors recommended reform of the tax
system to give more weight to income taxes. In addition, increased efforts are required to
reduce the size of the informal economy. Directors also called for a strengthening of the budget
process and of expenditure and debt management.

Directors were encouraged by the progress made in privatization and electricity sector reform,
but noted that the unfinished reform agenda remains large and urged the authorities to intensify
structural and institutional reform. In particular, further progress is needed in infrastructure
provision and other measures to improve the investment climate, including a stepped-up fight
against corruption. Directors observed that while indicators of absolute poverty have improved
in recent years owing to income growth, efforts to strengthen the safety net and targeting of
social programs are well placed.
Directors welcomed the findings of the Ex Post Assessment, which indicate that Fund
engagement in Albania has been successful in achieving macroeconomic stability with robust
economic growth. They believed that strong ownership of policies has been the key to this
success. Most Directors considered that, given the extensive remaining reform agenda, the
authorities’ intention to seek a successor three-year arrangement with the Fund is well-placed.
They noted the Ex Post Assessment’s conclusion that the Fund needs to remain engaged with
Albania at the present time, given the need to build capacity in macroeconomic management,
catalyze donor assistance, and mobilize domestic support for reforms. Directors stressed that
the authorities would need to remain committed to pursuing their reform objectives and develop
a sound strategy for exiting from the use of Fund resources. These will be important
considerations in any decision regarding a follow-up arrangement, and will require a political
commitment to move the reform agenda forward.
Directors stressed the need to improve the quality and timeliness of Albania’s statistics.
They welcomed the technical assistance provided by the Fund and other donors, and
encouraged the authorities to persist in their efforts in this area.
