STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. Following a sharp decline in 2009, output growth has rebounded strongly,
attesting to Mexico’s strong fundamentals and skillful policy making. Strong exports
are leading the recovery, with a rebound in domestic demand sustaining the
momentum. Strong growth is envisaged to continue this year and into 2012, bringing
output in line with potential, amid benign domestic inflationary conditions. Presidential
elections will take place in July 2012, with the new government in office in December.
Risks. Important downside risks persist, linked to the global outlook. A more protracted
slowdown in the U.S. would be a material drag to Mexico’s growth, given its close
integration with the U.S. economy. Although the direct impact from unsettled market
conditions in Europe would remain contained (with the bank channel considered to be
well ring-fenced), a surge in global risk aversion and generalized flight to quality could
affect even strong sovereign credits, like Mexico’s.
Policy Challenges
With Mexico’s economy expected to continue on a firm recovery, the challenge ahead
is how to gradually adjust the overall policy stance and rebuild policy buffers, weighing
domestic cyclical conditions against the potential impact of increased global downside
risks. As fiscal consolidation is judiciously underway, the central bank will need to
continue assessing the evolution of domestic and external circumstances in the coming
months in deciding the course of monetary policy going forward.
Over the medium term, the task remains how to unleash Mexico’s growth potential and
employment generation, while tackling its long-term fiscal challenges. Advancing
structural reforms would be key to increasing Mexico’s growth, particularly in an
environment of sluggish external demand. Addressing longer term fiscal challenges
from oil revenues and age-related spending to ensure fiscal sustainability will require a
combination of revenue mobilization efforts and expenditure rationalization.

MEXICO

Box 1: Corporates and Households Balance Sheets
Leverage levels in Mexico are moderate. The
government debt level is quite manageable, while
corporate and households leverage is modest.
Mexico’s V-shaped recovery has been supported by
the lack of significant balance sheet repair needs.
Corporates remain profitable and with moderate
leverage. A sample of 159 large corporates suggests
that profits were resilient to the crisis, and that
leverage levels remain modest. While the average

share of foreign debt has declined to about
30 percent of the total, short-term debt still accounts
for about two-thirds of total debt.
Household debt remains relatively low, at about
20 percent of disposable income. Consumer credit
amounts to less than 7 percent of disposable income
and has not returned to pre-crisis levels. Mortgage
lending has been more dynamic, but remains below
15 percent of disposable income.

MEXICO

Box 2. Foreign Exchange Liquidity Coefficient
International experience has shown that maturity
and currency mismatches in the banking sector can
amplify an exchange rate shock and create banking
and balance of payments disruptions. In addition,
Mexico’s past crises revealed that FX risk exposures
can be higher than suggested by net open positions,
because banks can be actively engaged in a variety
of operations, including speculative structured notes
in domestic currency linked to the exchange rate.
Learning from past crises, Mexico’s central bank has
had long-standing regulations on foreign exchange
exposures, including through a liquidity coefficient in
foreign currency. These regulations encourage banks
to have limited twin currency/maturity mismatches,
maintaining adequate liquidity in foreign currency,

5.

thereby requiring them to internalize the risk of
operating in a currency for which the central bank
has limited lender of last resort capacities.
The FX liquidity coefficient makes it very expensive
for banks to borrow in foreign currency and lend in
pesos, limiting capital inflow intermediated by the
banking system and its ability to be counterparty in
carry trade operations. To prevent regulatory
avoidance, the central bank has included in the
definition of foreign exchange positions the pesodenominated notes that are linked to the exchange
rate. In the event, the FX liquidity coefficient proved
useful to limit the impact of volatile capital flows on
Mexican banks during the 1998 Russian crisis and
the recent global financial crisis.

The macroeconomic balance, equilibrium real

CGER estimates indicate that the peso is broadly
in line with fundamentals. The macroeconomic
balance approach suggests that the real effective
exchange rate is only marginally (6 percent) above
its medium-term value, although the result is
sensitive to the envisaged trajectory of the oil
balance. The equilibrium real exchange rate and
external sustainability approaches show the real
exchange rate to be modestly below its mediumterm value.3 On average, there is no strong
indication that the peso is significantly apart from its
equilibrium level.

(Index)

2001

The current account deficit, which narrowed
during the global crisis, is expected to widen
gradually over the medium term. Mexico’s oil
balance is expected to deteriorate gradually under
the production and consumption trajectories
currently envisaged. The declining oil balance is
expected to be partially compensated by the
improvement in the non-oil balance. As a result, the
current account deficit will widen gradually to about
1½ percent of GDP by 2016, a moderate and
sustainable level.

Mexico: REER developments

2000

Mexico’s real effective exchange rate (REER) has
increased considerably since the trough of the
peso during the global crisis. Although this
increase amounted to 18 percent through April
2011, the REER is still about 4 percent below the
average pre-crisis level. In this context, Mexico’s
export performance has improved and its market
share in the U.S. has recovered from pre-crisis lows,
moving above the early-2000 levels.

Box 4. Central Bank Communication and Inflation Dynamics
The adoption of an inflation targeting (IT)
framework in the early 2000s represented a key
milestone in the evolution of Mexico’s monetary
policy regime. Together with the implementation of
prudent fiscal policies, the IT framework succeeded
in controlling inflation, bringing it down from nearly
20 percent in 1999 to an average level of about
4 percent since 2003, or close to the authorities’
3 percent target. Reflecting gains in Banxico’s
credibility, the price formation process in Mexico has
also become much less persistent under the IT
regime (e.g., Chiquiar et al., 2010), and medium-term
inflation expectations have been very firmly
anchored—albeit somewhat above the target—
despite fluctuations in headline inflation.
In an effort to further strengthen the IT
framework, Banxico has taken important
measures to enhance its communication,
bringing it in line with the international best
practice. In particular: (i) in 2011 Banxico started
publishing the minutes of its policy meetings, which
include detailed analyses of the global and domestic
economies, and covering extensively discussions



Common equity. Banks will need common
equity of 4.5 percent of assets plus a capital
conservation buffer of 2.5 percent, and a
counter-cyclical buffer (ranging from
0-2.5 percent). The conservation buffer imposes
constraints on earning distributions when the
situation of a bank deteriorates. At end-2010, all
banks complied with the minimum requirements
set for 2019, with common equity at
13.8 percent, significantly exceeding
requirements. While the authorities are working
on the practicality of instituting counter-cyclical
provisioning, the introduction of expected loanloss provisioning has brought about an element
of counter-cyclicality. Pending a decision on
counter-cyclical buffers, common equity is to be
increased by 2.5 percentage points in the
meantime.

Tier 1 capital of 6 percent. At end-2010,
Mexican banks had an average Tier one capital
ratio of 14.7 percent.

Leverage ratio of 3 times Tier 1 capital. The

leverage requirement is expected to become
effective by 2018, but it is not currently binding
for any bank in Mexico.

Liquidity requirements. The Liquid Coverage
Ratio and the Net Stable Funding ratio will be
subject to an observation period, with a review
to assess unintended consequences.


Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). It requires
banks to maintain a stock of “high-quality liquid
assets” that is sufficient to cover net cash
outflows for a 30-day period under a stress
scenario. In Mexico, banks’ liquid assets are large
in relation to short-term liabilities. A mid-2010
assessment suggests that only some of the
smaller banks may not yet comply with this ratio.



Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). This
standard requires a minimum amount of
funding that is expected to be stable over a oneyear horizon, based on liquidity risk factors
assigned to assets and off-balance sheet
liquidity exposures. Mexico has a significant
deposit base which places it well with respect to
this requirement.

Box 6. Financial Stability Council
In 2010, Mexico established a Financial Stability
Council (FSC) to identify and address systemic risk,
facilitating coordination and information exchange
among policy makers and financial regulators.
The Council is chaired by the Minister of Finance,
and includes representatives from the central bank,
the bank and exchange supervisor (CNBV), the
insurance supervisor (CNSF), the pension funds
regulator (CONSAR), and the deposit insurance
institute (IPAB). Although it is formally established to
work under a majority voting rule, it is in practice
envisaged to operate by consensus, with each
institution responsible for the implementation of
policies within its legal mandate.
The Council has set up four working groups to
strengthen its assessment of risks seeking to:

The FSC has recently published its first annual

Mexico’s financial sector, based on its stress testing
analysis. It highlighted a set of systemic risks,

Box 7. Tax Mobilization in Mexico
With oil revenues as a share of GDP envisaged to
diminish in the future, a tax mobilization effort
would be needed to replace lost revenues and
address age-related spending pressures. The level
of non-oil tax revenue in Mexico is one of the lowest
in the region and the lowest amongst OECD
countries. Recent revenue trends show non-oil tax
revenue in Mexico to be around 10 percent of GDP,
with income taxes accounting for 50 percent of nonoil tax revenues and VAT for 40 percent. Key
elements of Mexico’s tax system and potential areas
for reform include:
Personal income tax (PIT). The PIT in Mexico has a
narrow base because of uncapped deductions,
preferential regimes, and exemptions. Revenue
productivity is low, despite a 30 percent top rate, as
collections amounted 2.3 percent of GDP in 2010—
one of the lowest in the OECD. The PIT would need
to be simplified, its base broadened, and its
progressivity enhanced. A reform of the PIT would
bring exempt incomes (e.g., bonuses, overtime pay)
into the tax base and replace existing deductions
(e.g., mortgage interest) with higher basic exemption
allowances for all taxpayers.
Corporate income tax (CIT). Mexico’s CIT is
generally sound and competitive. The base of the
CIT could be broadened by bringing in



VAT. While VAT collections have been increasing
slowly over the past decade, widespread zero rates
and exemptions continue to seriously reduce their
yield. These weaknesses, together with a reduced
VAT rate in the border areas, complicate
administration and make the VAT in Mexico the least
revenue productive in the OECD. The VAT should be
broadened by minimizing exemptions, unifying the
rate across the country, and limiting zero rates to
exports.
Fuel taxation. Domestic fuel prices in Mexico are
administered. Given the spike in oil prices at the end
of 2010, Mexico’s policy of gradual gasoline price
increases led to a “negative” excise tax in 2011.
Gasoline pricing should continue to be increased
and aligned with international process to regain a
positive gasoline taxation in Mexico.
Subnational taxation. Subnational government
revenue mobilization in Mexico is very low and
should be enhanced. At around 1.3 percent of GDP,
local tax collection is well below most OECD
countries. For instance, municipal taxation of real
estate yields ¼ percent of GDP compared to about
1 percent of GDP on average in OECD countries and
¾ percent of GDP in other Latin American countries.

Mexico’s public debt is moderate and will

remain stable over the medium term under the

term. But Mexico’s balanced-budget

baseline scenario, at around 43 percent of

Figures in the boxes represent average projections for the respective variables in the baseline and scenario being
presented. Ten-year historical average for the variable is also shown.
2/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and primary balance.
3/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent and 10 percent of GDP shock to contingent liabilities occur in 2010,
with real depreciation defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local
currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.
7/ External debt is converted in pesos using end of period exchange rates.

Partnership Strategy (CPS) was instrumental in
helping Mexico adjusting to the large adverse
shocks experienced during 2008–2009. The
global economic downturn and tightening in
financial conditions combined with the
outbreak of the A (H1N1) influenza in April
2009 led much of the World Bank’s assistance
to Mexico to focus on financial services while

agenda.

As of May 31, 2011, Mexico was the Bank’s
second largest borrower with US$12.8 billion
debt outstanding, representing 9.7 percent of
the IBRD’s total portfolio. As of this date,
Mexico had the fifth largest portfolio under
supervision in terms of net IBRD commitments

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Mexico
On July 27, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Mexico. 1
Background
Mexico has recovered rapidly from the fallout of the global crisis. After a sharp
contraction in 2009, growth in Mexico picked up strongly in 2010, reaching 5.4 percent.
Robust growth has brought output back to pre-crisis levels, with manufacturing exports
leading the recovery and the rebound in domestic demand helping sustain the
momentum. This rapid rebound in output has been underpinned by Mexico’s sound
public and private sector balance sheets, strong prudential framework, and the effective
countercyclical policy response, with the floating exchange rate providing also an
important buffer to the fallout from the global crisis and supporting the recovery. The
three successive Flexible Credit Line arrangements (currently with an access equivalent
to US$73 billion) have backed the authorities’ macroeconomic strategy by providing a
significant buffer against potential tail risks.
Strong growth is envisaged to continue this year and next, at about 4.5 and 4.1 percent
respectively. The near term outlook is supported by the expected continued recovery in
the U.S. and solid domestic demand growth in Mexico. In this context, inflation has
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings

remained benign, with headline and core inflation declining to the 3 percent target. With
demand pressures still subdued and inflation expectations well-anchored, the central
bank has maintained the policy rates at 4.5 percent (since mid-2009). The current
account deficit is projected to widen moderately this year to 1 percent of Gross Domestic
Product (GDP), and to 1.5 percent over the medium term.
Capital inflows have increased in 2010 and 2011, on the back of sizable flows to pesodenominated government securities. This has reflected Mexico’s improved outlook and
its inclusion in the global bond index WGBI in 2010, which has attracted long-term
institutional investors. In this context, the peso has appreciated by some 25 percent in
real effective terms since the depth of the crisis, but still is somewhat below the precrisis levels. International reserves have increased by US$27 billion over the last 12
months, with gross reserves now at US$131 billion, mostly through the sale of oil
revenues, with rules-based interventions playing only a limited role. The banking system
continues to be liquid and well-capitalized, with funding mainly from domestic deposits.
Private sector credit growth has picked up in line with the economic recovery, with
household and corporate leverage ratios broadly stable.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their strong rules-based policy
framework, which has underpinned skillful macroeconomic stewardship and a rapid
turnaround in activity. With the recovery expected to remain firm, a gradual withdrawal of
the policy stimulus that takes due account of the significant global uncertainty is
warranted in the near term. Directors noted that the main medium-term challenges for
Mexico are to bolster its growth potential and address long-term fiscal challenges.
Directors supported the authorities’ fiscal consolidation plans, including returning to the
balanced budget rule next year and lifting the ceiling on the accumulation of resources
in the oil stabilization fund to save oil revenue windfalls. They welcomed the planned
adjustment of gasoline prices to bring them gradually in line with international prices,
while strengthening the social safety net to protect the most vulnerable. Directors
encouraged further efforts to rebuild fiscal buffers over the medium term, particularly in
view of population aging and the projected decline in oil revenues relative to GDP. This
requires a combination of expenditure restraint and non-oil revenue mobilization,
including at the sub national government level. Consideration should be given to
adopting a structural budget rule to reduce policy pro-cyclicality, and broadening the
coverage of fiscal accounts to include sub-national governments.
Directors supported the accommodative monetary policy stance, given contained
inflationary pressures and well-anchored expectations. However, they noted the
challenge of calibrating the policy settings in a way that balances domestic cyclical
considerations against global uncertainties as fiscal consolidation is underway. Directors

underscored the need for the authorities to remain vigilant and stand ready to take
action as needed.
Directors agreed that Mexico’s flexible exchange rate has played an important role in
absorbing external shocks and managing capital inflows. They took note of the
authorities’ limited intervention through the transparent, rules-based mechanisms.
Directors welcomed the resilience of Mexico’s financial sector—the result of the
authorities’ efforts to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory framework. They
considered that financial supervision has been further bolstered by the establishment of
the Financial Stability Council to monitor systemic risks and address potential
vulnerabilities, and that Mexico is well placed to meet Basel III prudential standards
ahead of schedule. Directors looked forward to a comprehensive review of progress in
the forthcoming Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) update.
Directors emphasized that ambitious structural reforms are crucial to increase
productivity and promote investment. They welcomed steps to improve anti-trust
regulations, and called for a comprehensive strategy to address the most pressing
constraints and prioritize reform efforts. Key among them is to improve labor flexibility,
access to credit for small- and medium-sized enterprises, and job opportunities in the
formal sector. Enhancing the efficiency and governance of state energy companies is
also a priority.
Directors underlined the importance of closely monitoring cross-border spillovers, noting
that a surge in global risk aversion could affect Mexico despite its strong fundamentals.
They continued to view the Flexible Credit Line arrangement as a useful insurance
against potential global tail risks. In this context, some Directors saw a further build-up of
international reserves as part of an exit strategy from the arrangement, while a few
others considered Mexico’s reserve coverage to be adequate.
