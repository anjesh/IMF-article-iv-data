MONTENEGRO
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 27, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context: Three years after the global crisis, economic output has almost recovered and
financial sector conditions are stabilizing. In other ways, though, the crisis and its
repercussions are still acute, most visibly in the sizeable and continuing buildup of
public debt and a tightening liquidity squeeze in the economy.
Fiscal Policy: Public debt has risen sharply. The immediate priority is a substantial
reduction in the fiscal financing requirement. The authorities have adopted ambitious
medium-term targets; they must urgently be underpinned with credible and highquality measures, including staff cuts, and some tax increases. The tight fiscal stance
must be carried forward to lower public debt.
Financial Sector: Important progress was made in stabilizing the banking system, but
continued progress in financial regulation and supervision is required. Policy actions
should focus on liquidity and raising capital buffers of banks. The new resolution
framework should be applied if owners fail to meet capital calls, onsite control of NPL
identification and disposal be tightened, and legal and administrative obstacles to
collateral execution be tackled.
Structural Reform: The country has been at the vanguard of structural reform in the
region, though progress has recently slowed, especially on labor markets and
previously privatized large enterprises. It is essential to invigorate structural reform with
a focus on redressing gaps that are well-identified in relevant surveys; end support to
aluminum and steel plants; and increase flexibility in labor contracts.

Moreover, foreign parent-bank

support has recently been reduced. By the
later stages of the lending boom, banks had
increasingly relied on foreign borrowing to
finance credit expansion. This reliance rose
further as foreign parents stepped up their
support to offset the large deposit outflows in
order to avoid an immediate disorderly
adjustment to banks’ balance sheets. As
deposits began to stabilize, however, flows

declined by 20 percent, with credit to the nonfinancial private sector contracting by onethird. By early 2012, banks had made
considerable progress in re-aligning their
lending with their domestic deposit base and
the average loan-to-deposits ratio returned to
end-2007 levels at 112 percent in February,

REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
A. Outlook and Risks
11.

Staff and authorities agreed that

sustainable medium-term growth required
attracting large-scale FDI to unleash
Montenegro’ significant potential. Given the
limited amount of financing available
domestically, foreign investment offers the
benefit of a more rapid transition to higher
income levels. The authorities observed that
despite the ongoing sharp post-boom
slowdown, FDI inflows still amount to more
than 10 percent of GDP. They saw this as
evidence of continued investor confidence that
augured well for a quick pick up in FDI once
global and European economic conditions
improved. The staff concurred in principle, but
noted that some of the recent FDI was in fact

backward looking—for example bank
recapitalization.
12.

Differing views were held regarding

competitiveness. Staff and authorities
concurred that the application of traditional
competitiveness analysis in Montenegro is
subject to considerable uncertainty. In addition
to the weak statistical base, the very small size
of the economy implies that a few lumpy
foreign investment projects—that need not be
large in absolute terms—could drastically
change the outlook, a fact not captured in
standard real exchange rate assessments or
the computation of current account norms.

addition to external risks, which also include

risks (see Risk Assessment Matrix, Annex II). In
particular, if depositor confidence again
retreated or if government were faced with

deposits, some foreign parents may end
support, thus triggering potential outward
reputational spillovers despite Montenegro’s
small size. The authorities considered that their
macroframework with 0.5 percent GDP growth
in 2012 already included a large part of the
risks, and that there was significant upside,

15.

Accordingly, staff argued for a

significant recalibration of policies. Staff
considered that the recent experience with
public borrowing, which did not result in a
lasting improvement in growth prospects or
vulnerabilities, underscored the need to
change the policy framework. Tighter fiscal
policy, accelerated structural reform, and
policies facilitating orderly banking sector
deleveraging would attract and catalyze
stronger inflows. The immediate priority was a
substantial reduction in the fiscal financing
requirement, while invigorating labor markets.
The details are discussed in the following
sections.

MONTENEGRO 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 1. External Competitiveness
The application of traditional competitiveness analysis in Montenegro is subject to considerable uncertainty, given the very small
size of the economy and the weak statistical base. Even so, competitiveness appears compromised.
A standard assessment of the real exchange rate using the
CGER methodology indicates that Montenegro’s exchange
rate is overvalued. However, there are large data uncertainties
that make the exercise imprecise (errors and omissions
amount to some 10 percent of GDP), and only a relatively
short time series is available. In addition, there is considerable
uncertainty regarding the country’s medium-term current
account balance; for a small economy such as Montenegro, a
surge in service exports or a contraction in imports can
substantially narrow the current account gap without any
underlying gain in competitiveness.
A look at the CPI-based REER estimates shows Montenegro’s
REER began to depreciate again in 2011. Montenegro’s wage
data show continued erosion in competitiveness stemming
from its high labor costs. Over the past few years, gross wages
have risen steadily while producer prices have been flat.

The sector that has contributed to increased external
competiveness is tourism. The tourism competitiveness
ranking has improved substantially owing to a better
regulatory framework and infrastructure. Moreover the
growth of international tourist arrivals into Montenegro has
on average outpaced the growth rates seen at the regional
and world levels in the past four years. Given its importance
in the Montenegrin economy, it is essential that the tourism
sector continues to make gains.

Montenegro’s exports as a share of total world trade which
began to decrease in 2008 have started to pick up again in
2011. On the other hand, its share of imports peaked in 2008
and has been declining ever since.

Box 2. Kombinat Aluminijuma Podgorica (KAP)
Kombinat Aluminijuma Podgorica (KAP) is the
aluminum smelter in Montenegro. Up until
recently, it has been operated by the Russian
company Central European Aluminum
Company (CEAC). The company acquired a
majority share in KAP in 2005 when the plant
was privatized. In 2010, the government retook
half of CEAC’s stake in exchange for loan
guarantees. KAP accounted for 41 percent of
the value of goods exported by Montenegro in
2011.
The plant currently suffers from significant
operational inefficiencies and is neither
competitive nor profitable without large
investments in technology upgrades. In recent
years, the company has been able to sustain
operations only with the support of
government-issued loan guarantees and energy
subsidies that constitute an increasing drain on
public finances. In addition, despite favorable
aluminum prices in 2011, KAP has been running
large payment arrears on its electricity bills. As
the largest energy consumer in the country, the
mounting receivables are in turn threatening
the viability of the electricity producer. Without
these subsidies, staff estimates show that KAP
would have made a €21.9 million loss in 2011,
or 0.7 percent of GDP. With €132 million of its
€350 million debt covered by state guarantees,
KAP is currently the biggest and most imminent
fiscal risk.

18.

The authorities aim at significant

While KAP remains an important contributor to
Montenegro’s exports, its overall
macroeconomic impact has declined
considerably over the past decade. The net
impact on the balance of payments is mitigated
by the imported inputs required (both
electricity and alumina). Moreover, KAP has
substantially reduced the number of workers in
recent years and now accounts for only
0.8 percent of total employment. The direct
impact on GDP from closing KAP due to
decreased export is estimated at 1.3 percent (a
similar estimate of 1.9 percent is obtained using
the production approach). The short-term
impact of closing down its operations would
likely be substantially offset over the mediumterm by efficiency gains realized from increased
fiscal space, energy surplus, and reduced
alumina import.

in the 15-24 age group.
The high unemployment rate among the
economically active young points to a gap
between the skills supplied and demanded in
the labor market. To an extent, this gap is
driven by the mismatch in skills produced in
the education system and those needed in the
growing sectors. At the same time, the lack of
unemployment deterrents and the existing
structure of social safety nets may provide the
jobless with an incentive to choose
unemployment over certain types of jobs.
Therefore, more and more foreign workers are
hired into the economy each year to fill the
labor need despite the availability of workers

to capital
markets.



Medium
Although it has stabilized since 2009, the banking
system remains relatively fragile: non-performing loans
remain high, provisioning is lagging, and the sector as a
whole continued to record losses in 2011.
The unilateral use of the euro in Montenegro essentially
rules out significant central bank liquidity injections, and
there is limited scope for further fiscal support or capital
injections from parent banks given financial pressures in
their home markets.









3.

Medium
The eurozone sovereign debt crisis and its impact on
economic activity across the region remains a key risk.

Expected Impact if Threat is Realized
(high, medium or low)







High
In addition to the loan to KAP that the government has
already assumed, additional loan guarantees for KAP
amounting to 3.2 percent were also extended during
2009–10 and are at risk of being called.
Political pressures in the lead up to autumn elections
could put pressure on the government to provide
further support to struggling enterprises.
In the event that the government opts to keep KAP
operating, it could face potentially large operating
losses. There also remains the possibility of significant
environmental contingencies and clean-up costs.
Medium
Montenegro’s credibility with international investors has
become increasingly constrained in light of the sharp
increase in public debt. The 2016 Eurobond is currently
trading at a spread of roughly 800 basis points.






High
A sharp deterioration in eurozone
conditions could have a
significant adverse impact on
tourism and foreign direct
investment, which are key drivers
of the domestic economy.
Tourism receipts alone accounted
for close to one-fifth of GDP in
2012.
High
A sudden outflow of deposits
would accelerate the process of
bank deleveraging and add to
growing liquidity pressures within
the economy.
A worsening of the already
stressed liquidity conditions
would increase tax arrears and
create a potential fiscal financing
gap.
A further contraction in bank
lending would also be a potential
significant drag on domestic
demand.
High
Additional expenditures
associated with contingent
liabilities would further stretch
the already ambitious budget
target for 2012 and exacerbate
financing pressures.

High
Large fiscal deficits have eroded
deposit buffers.
The small domestic capital
market increases reliance
international capital markets for
budget financing.

MONTENEGRO

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
Montenegro has joined World Bank Group
(WBG) as an independent country in January
2007. The Bank had implemented a discrete
program of lending and analytical work for
Montenegro for most of the period since the
State Union of Serbia and Montenegro had
joined the WBG in 2001, with three projects
still being active at the onset of Montenegro’s
first Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for the
fiscal years 2007–10. Within this framework,
the Board approved two IDA credits
(US$19 million)—just prior to graduation—and
five IBRD loans (US$54 million) to provide
selective support to three key country

priorities: (i) enhancing sustainable
macroeconomic growth; (ii) building
institutions and strengthening the rule of law;
and (iii) improving the standard of living for
citizens. The committed portfolio has grown
from US$34 million in 2007 to US$97 million in
2012 (including the new IBRD loan approved
within the new CPS for FY 2011–2014). About
66 percent of these commitments remain to be
disbursed. Investment operations are focused
principally on supporting sustainable
development and human development.

In January 2011, the Board approved the
US$216 million CPS for FY2011–14. This CPS
supports the government’s overarching
objective of full integration with the EU within
a medium-term horizon. The strategy—
reflecting Montenegro’s status as an upper
middle income client with well-defined

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

development priorities—aims at
(i) strengthening institutions and
competitiveness in line with EU accession
requirements; and (ii) improving environmental
management including reducing the costs of
environmental problems. The government has
requested the Bank to focus its support in

MONTENEGRO

areas where it had previously been engaged
and/or gained applicable regional or global
experience. The centerpiece of the Bank’s
engagement in 2011 was the financial-sector
development policy loan (FSDPL) of
US$80 million, which was disbursed in early
2012. Currently, the Bank is preparing a
Policy Based Guarantee (PBG) of US$80 million,
which supports the government’s program to
strengthen the banking sector, bring
regulations into line with EU norms, and
encourage resumption of credit growth. The
third pillar of the Bank’s engagement in 2012
will be a US$50 million development policy
loan, which will provide budget support to
strengthen public expenditure efficiency and
policies geared towards sustained growth.
New investment lending was approved for a
Higher Education/R&D project in amount of
US$16 million, while a small investment is
planned to facilitate Montenegrin participation
in a Regional Catastrophe Risk Insurance
Facility, and an additional new investment
lending for the Industrial Waste Management
and Clean-Up Project. In the area of analytical
work, the main ongoing task is the preparation
of the Country Economic Memorandum (CEM)
report with the view to provide analytical
support to the authorities’ thinking and policy
deliberations about how best to implement its
accelerated growth agenda in Montenegro’s
process of accession to the EU and a vision of
a prosperous economy.

complementary economic and sector work, will
continue to provide input to the IMF on issues
such as (i) public expenditure, including
pension and health reforms; (ii) business
climate and competitiveness, including labor
market reform and resolution of
nonperforming loans; (iii) public sector
institutions and fiduciary review, and
(iv) agricultural assessment; and (v) statistical
capacity building and poverty monitoring. The
Fund and Bank staff have sought each other’s
input in internal review processes.

Cooperation with the IMF has been good,
particularly the areas of macroeconomic and
financial sector policies. Bank and Fund teams
have coordinated closely during the
preparation of the FSDPL and PBG in 2011 and
2012. The World Bank Group, through its
ongoing and planned operations, as well its

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of end-March 2012)
A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings that significantly affect surveillance. The
main problems are in national accounts and balance of payments. Montenegro began
participation in the GDDS in December 2011.
National Accounts: The Statistical Office of Montenegro (MONSTAT) compiles real sector
data. MONSTAT has started to adopt the 1993 System of National Accounts as a framework
for compiling national accounts estimates. The scope of the accounts is currently limited to
the annual production and expenditure account in current and previous year’s prices.
Accuracy of the data sources needs to be improved and breaks in the time series eliminated
by revising historical data. Business statistics are still following the material system product
concepts, collecting data mainly on quantities produced. The quality of investment and
merchandise trade data is unsatisfactory. MONSTAT switched from general to specific trade
statistics in an effort to better capture imports; however, there are indications that exports
remain under-recorded, resulting in an underestimation of GDP. National accounts data are
also undermined by the lack of sound techniques to account for unreported activities. Some
work has been done on measuring informal activity in construction, retail trade, hotels and
restaurants, but a more comprehensive approach needs to be developed. Statistical
techniques for deriving volume measures of GDP are constrained by the lack of suitable
price and volume indices.
Some progress has been made in the compilation of quarterly national accounts. Following
STA missions to Podgorica in December 2010 and August 2011 to assist MONSTAT in the
compilation of NA and QNA, data needs are being addressed. The latest STA mission
concluded there is still a critical need to: (i) improve data quality, volume measures price
indices by economic activity, as well as data exhaustiveness for annual GDP; (ii) compile
quarterly GDP components at current and previous year’s prices. The QNA statistics for the
first quarter of 2012 are scheduled to be published in July 2012.
Price statistics: MONSTAT compiles and disseminates monthly consumer and producer
price indices, which broadly follow international standards. However, in both indices, the
“carry-forward” technique for treatment of seasonal goods, new goods, and missing items
are used, resulting in a downward bias. There are inconsistencies between monthly and
annual price indices. The EU harmonized consumer price indices, as well as export and
import price indices were compiled and released starting in 2011. The export price index has
been published since 2009, and the industrial import price index since 2011.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 7

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

MONTENEGRO

Labor market statistics: MONSTAT reports labor and wage statistics based on data from
the labor force survey (LFS) and administrative sources. The unemployment rate from the LFS
is computed according to the ILO definition. The quality of the labor and wage indicators is
relatively good, but information on foreign employment remains limited. Frequent
methodological revisions also impair time series analyses.
Government finance statistics: Fiscal data are compiled by the Ministry of Finance (MOF)
based on a new GFS institutional classification, and since early 2006, include data on local
governments and social security funds. The latter was merged with the treasury account in
2010. The chart of accounts introduced in 2001 has been implemented at the local level from
mid-2005. Fiscal data reporting suffers from frequent re-classifications. The MOF has
established a unit responsible for data collection for state-owned enterprises (SOE), but a
satisfactory compilation of the public sector fiscal balance requires significant further effort.
Data on enterprises owned by municipalities are rarely available. Data on the stock of local
government arrears need to be significantly strengthened and disseminated.
Monetary statistics: Monetary and financial statistics are compiled by the Central Bank of
Montenegro (CBM), broadly following the institutional coverage, classification, and
evaluation methodology set forth in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (2000).
Dissemination practices meet the recommendations of the General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS) with respect to the periodicity and timeliness for financial sector data.
Beginning in early 2006, the CBM publishes detailed monetary statistics in its monthly
Statistical Bulletin, which includes tables on monetary statistics, balance sheets and surveys
for the CBM and commercial banks.
Balance of payments: Balance of payments statistics are compiled by the CBM following
international reporting standards. The external sector statistics have benefited from
improvements undertaken by MONSTAT to improve coverage, valuation, and classification of
merchandise trade statistics. Data on imports and exports in the BOP are compiled
according to the special trade system. The CBM adjusts export and import data from
MONSTAT from CIF to FOB basis. The difference in the external data from the CBM and from
MONSTAT reflects this adjustment. However, there are indications that exports continue to
be underestimated. This is an issue that MONSTAT is currently investigating.
Weaknesses remain, due primarily to the paucity of source data and the shortage of staff to
undertake the data collection and compilation processes. As with many euroized economies,
difficulty in estimating currency and deposits and large errors and omissions continue to be
an issue in the balance of payment statistics. The CBM has made progress in improving the
recording of transactions via the ITRS by refining the transactions coding system and
increasing interaction with the commercial banks. However, the ITRS remains inadequate for
recording a broad range of balance of payments transactions such as reinvested earnings
and trade credits. Further, the ITRS records transactions on a cash basis, whereas balance of
payments transactions should be recorded on an accruals basis. The CBM still needs to
8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MONTENEGRO

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

undertake a small number of direct surveys of enterprises to supplement the data received
through the ITRS, and prepare comprehensive documentation on compilation methods and
data sources.
The CBM has received TA on International Investment Position (IIP) statistics, but does not
yet disseminate these data.
B. Data Standards and Quality
Montenegro began participating in the
No data ROSC is available.
GDDS in December 2011.
C. Reporting to STA
A page for Montenegro in International Financial Statistics (IFS) was introduced in the
March 2007 issue.
Montenegro does not report government finance statistics for publication in the Government
Finance Statistics Yearbook or IFS.
Montenegro does not report data for the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey and
the Coordinated Direct Investment Survey, respectively.
The CBM does not yet report monetary data in the format of Standardized Report Forms
(SRFs). To avoid duplication of effort, the CBM will need to decide whether to adopt the
European Central Bank’s framework for collecting, compiling and reporting monetary data or
the STA-developed SRFs, either of which will provide monetary data that accord with
international standards.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Montenegro
May 11, 2012

This statement provides information that has become available since issuance of the
Staff Report. The information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
The first quarter fiscal outturn was weaker than expected, largely on the back of
considerable revenue underperformance (a decline of 12 percent year-on-year), while wages
and entitlement spending came in lower than budgeted. These factors pushed the first quarter
Central Government deficit to 1.6 percent of GDP, in excess to the original full-year general
government deficit target of 1.2 percent.
2.
The cabinet adopted a revised 2012 budget that increases excise duties on heating
oil and gas; introduces a new tax on SIM cards, cable TV, electricity meters and smoking
zones; and reduces allowances and salaries for public officials and capital spending. The
authorities estimate the combined 2012 fiscal savings from these measures at 0.7 percent of
GDP and are seeking parliamentary approval.
3.
The government has finalized a commercial bank loan. The five-year loan for
€150mn provides €100mn in new financing, with €50mn refinancing a previous loan due in
2015, and thereby lowers near-term fiscal financing risks.
4.
A potential buyer for the insolvent steel mill has emerged while discussions on
the future of the aluminium plant (KAP) remain ongoing. A successful bid was placed at
the third steel plant auction in May. Regarding KAP, following the parliamentary decision in
March to cancel the privatization contract, negotiations with the owner over the resolution of
their stake in KAP continue. Parallel negotiations are taking place with lenders over a
possible rescheduling of two guaranteed loans to KAP (totaling €110 million) that are at risk
of being called.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Montenegro
On May 11, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Montenegro.1
Background
Three years after the sudden end of Montenegro’s boom, there has been considerable progress
toward recovery. Strong growth in tourism supported real GDP growth of 2½ percent in 2011,
bringing output nearly back to its pre-crisis level in 2008. The recovery is at risk of stalling,
however, with the projected downturn in the euro area likely to weigh on growth in 2012. The
debt overhang continues to linger, moreover, with domestic liquidity shortages a growing
constraint. High-frequency economic indicators depict a weakening of activity in late 2011 and
early 2012.
In addition, the policy buffers that have supported growth in recent years have been largely
depleted. Public debt has risen sharply since 2007, increasing from 28 to 47 percent of GDP at
the end of 2011, as fiscal surpluses quickly turned into large deficits following the collapse of the
boom.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

Fiscal imbalances have proved difficult to rein in, reflecting a large fall in revenue after the
collapse of the boom, rising pension expenditures, and costs stemming from public support for
struggling enterprises. However, and notwithstanding an increase in the headline deficit, there
was some progress toward fiscal consolidation in 2011. Although the headline deficit rose to
6.3 percent of GDP, this partly reflected payment of called loan guarantees that had been
extended in 2009-10 but did not have an impact on demand in 2011. Adjusting for these
payments, the fiscal stance tightened by 0.7 percent of GDP. The authorities aim for further
consolidation this year and over the medium term, and are in the process of identifying needed
measures to achieve this adjustment.
After three years of rapid bank deleveraging, there are indications that conditions are stabilizing.
The gradual return of deposits to the banking system continued in 2011, and banks took steps
to off-load problem loans and re-align their lending with their domestic deposit base. However,
the system remains burdened by high non-performing loans—notwithstanding their recent sharp
decline—and is lagging in provisioning. New bank lending remains limited, reflecting the existing
debt overhang and the significant uncertainty over the economic outlook.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities’ efforts to stabilize the economy, and welcomed
the progress made since the financial crisis. With the recovery now at risk of stalling, Directors
called for intensified efforts to address large fiscal and external imbalances, further enhance
financial sector stability, and improve competitiveness.
Directors recognized the sizable public expenditure adjustment over the past few years, but
underscored the need for further high-quality deficit reducing measures to put public debt on a
declining trajectory. While fiscal consolidation will need to rely on both revenue and expenditure
measures, the more sizable adjustment should come from further spending cuts. Directors saw
the 2012 supplementary budget, adopted by the cabinet, as a step in the right direction. Going
forward, Directors recommended further reducing personnel and entitlement spending. They
underscored the importance of ending fiscal and quasi-fiscal support to the metals sector and
assessing its viability. Directors stressed that revenue measures should focus on improving tax
administration, but saw some scope to raise tax rates that are below regional levels. Some
Directors cautioned that tax rate increases should be considered only after tax administration is
strengthened, given their potential impact on competitiveness.
Directors commended the authorities’ efforts to stabilize the financial sector, and to improve the
framework for crisis preparedness and banking resolution. Given remaining vulnerabilities, they
stressed the need to further strengthen supervision and regulation, including the
macroprudential framework. They underlined the need to enforce capital requirements and
improve asset quality, while monitoring liquidity closely and maintaining high prudential buffers.

Directors welcomed progress in advancing structural reforms, and called on the authorities to
accelerate efforts to enhance competitiveness and attract foreign investment. In particular, they
underscored the need to further improve the business environment and increase labor market
flexibility. Directors also saw merit in reforms to ensure that social protection schemes target the
neediest and do not impede labor market participation.
Directors called for continued efforts to address shortcomings in economic statistics which
hamper policy design and evaluation.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Menno Snel, Executive Director for Montenegro and Ana Martinis,
Advisor to the Executive Director
May 11, 2012
The authorities of Montenegro would like to thank staff for the open and constructive
dialogue during the mission. The authorities broadly agree with staff’s analysis and share
staff’s views regarding the economic challenges ahead. The importance of the staff papers is
hard to overestimate, especially for a small country like Montenegro, for which Fund
publications represent the most complete source of information and reference for
international financial markets. Bearing this in mind, and fully devoted to transparency, the
authorities continue the practice of consenting to the publication of the staff report.
Macroeconomic developments
Montenegro’s economic activity recovered after a major contraction in 2009, boosted by
continued foreign investment inflows and buoyant tourism revenues. Thus, real GDP grew by
2.5 percent annually in 2010 and 2011. Price stability has been maintained, despite moderate
acceleration of inflation in 2011 driven by food and fuel prices and increases in excises on
alcohol and tobacco. The current account deficit has adjusted considerably since the wake of
the crisis (from above 50 percent in 2008 to 19.4 percent in 2011), but, nevertheless, external
imbalances remain high.
As of late 2011 the external conditions deteriorated, leading to a slowdown in exports and
consequently, weakening of growth. In addition, the first quarter of 2012 was particularly
challenging due to several other exogenous shocks - the extremely difficult weather
conditions, that paralyzed trade and transport for almost two weeks in February, and
unplanned budget costs related to the repayment of a state-guaranteed loan for the aluminum
company KAP. Hence, for this year the authorities expect growth to slow down to 0.5
percent, while inflation is expected to remain well contained (around 2 percent on average).
Fiscal policy
The authorities are fully aware that in a euroized system with no leeway for monetary policy,
fiscal policy is the main effective instrument for policy adjustment. Against such backdrop,
throughout the past three years the authorities have pursued strong fiscal consolidation.
Fiscal expenditures have been cut by more than 8 percentage points of GDP in the period
2008-2012, achieving one of the largest expenditure adjustments among the peer countries.
Last year alone the expenditures were down by 1.8 percent of GDP including a guarantee
payment of 1 percent of GDP, bringing adjustment to 2.8 percent in only one year. While the
cuts were mostly related to non-essential capital spending, the authorities also implemented
new rules for strict control of public wages and initiated downsizing of the public sector
work force, centralized monitoring of all current expenditures, reduced the number of
spending units and adopted a new financing scheme for local governments. According to the
authorities’ data, arrears were reduced in 2011 by 0.3 percent of GDP.

2
Also in line with previous Fund advice, the authorities recently signed an agreement with the
public sector unions which introduces opt-out clauses from collective agreements and allows
for public wage decrease if one of the two predefined criteria is satisfied: (i) real GDP growth
below 2 percent or (ii) budget balance below zero. These triggers represent for the
Government favorable economic criteria provisions for the wage adjustments and could
easily result in public sector wage cuts already for this year.
Despite the sizeable headline fiscal adjustment, the country’s overall fiscal position has been
hit hard by the materialization of contingent liabilities, in particular the state-guaranteed
loans for the metal industry. In 2011 the government repaid a guarantee amounting to 1
percent of GDP for a steel company which declared bankruptcy, while in April 2012 a
guarantee for the aluminum company KAP was called and fully repaid in the amount of 0.7
percent of GDP. Against this backdrop, and due to revenue shortfalls, the major
consolidation efforts have not been reflected in the overall balances. However, the
Government has recently (end-April) sold the bankrupt steel mill to a Turkish steel company,
which will bring additional 0.3 percent of GDP of revenues in 2012 and thus help reduce the
fiscal burden of the guarantee payments.
Public debt reached 45.3 percent of GDP as of end-February 2012 and, although it has not
reached the 60-percent threshold, the authorities are mindful of the high debt sustainability
risks due to their unique policy framework. Given the currently unfavorable financing
conditions on international markets, this year the authorities plan to rely predominantly on
bilateral and multilateral borrowing, including through World Bank assistance. After the
approval of the Development Policy Loan (DPL) early this year, Montenegro is in the final
stage of negotiations for a Policy-Based Guarantee (PBG), which, if successfully completed,
would help the country in acquiring financing under substantially more favorable terms.
Supplementary budget for 2012
In order to address the revenue shortfall in the first quarter (amounting to 0.7 percent of GDP
compared to last year) and to provide fiscal space for financing the guarantee payment, in
April the Government introduced a supplementary budget with total fiscal adjustment of 1.2
percent of GDP. The new budget is expected to be adopted by the Parliament by end-May
and includes specific deficit-cutting measures on both the revenue and the expenditure sides:
-

Revenue-boosting measures (with expected effect of 0.7 percent of GDP) include:
introduction of tax on mobile SIM cards, cable television and electricity meters, a fee for
“smoking zones”, increase in excises on fuel oil for heating, tax on undistributed profits,
measures against the unofficial economy, improvements in tax collection etc. However,
the authorities aim at keeping the basic tax rates unchanged in order to maintain the
country’s comparative advantage of low basic taxation.

-

On the expenditure side, cuts amount to 0.5 percent of GDP and include savings on
official automobiles, telephone services, travel allowances, office material costs, a 7percent wage cut for high-ranking public officials and embassy employees and further
cuts in capital spending.

Financial sector
The banking sector had been severely hit by the boom-bust episode, including through
deposit withdrawals, credit crunch, deteriorating quality of credit portfolios and eroding
profitability. Hence, given the limited scope for the use of conventional monetary policy
instruments, the central bank focused its policy actions on improving the regulatory and
supervisory framework.
Thanks to decisive actions by the authorities, during 2011 the situation in the banking sector
improved significantly. Tightened regulation pressed foreign owners to recapitalize their
banks and to ensure appropriate liquidity in the system. The capital adequacy ratio rose to
16.5 percent of risk-weighted assets as of end-2011. Non-performing loans fell by 10
percentage points from their peak reached in mid-2011 until the end of the same year, as
major banks, pushed by the increased provisioning requirements, cleaned their balance sheets
by selling their bad credit portfolio to parent banks or to factoring companies financed by
parent banks. Confidence in the banking system has been restored and deposits started
recovering. Nevertheless, credit activity still remains subdued, affected by the high financing
costs and lack of credit demand from creditworthy clients.
Going forward, the authorities are fully aware of the potential spillover risks from the euro
area crisis and the deleveraging processes in Europe and will thus continue improving the
macroprudential framework. The central bank recently established a Council for bank
liquidity, adopted regulation on large exposures and implemented stress testing in
coordination with the ECB. Furthermore, contingency plans have been recently adopted by
each and every regulatory institution at the internal level, and the National Contingency Plan,
developed in cooperation with the Fund’s technical assistance, has been adopted by the
Financial Stability Council. Finally, five new laws covering the financial sector will be
adopted in 2012 (i.e. an insurance law and a compulsory insurance law, a law on capital
markets, a law on payment services, and a law on financial collaterals).
Structural reforms
In addition to fiscal consolidation and improvements in public finances, significant progress
has been made in tackling medium-term challenges through implementation of an ambitious
and comprehensive structural reform agenda:
1.

2.

A labor market reform, adopted in 2010 and additionally amended in 2011, liberalized
the use of fixed term contracts, lowered the minimum obligatory level of severance
payments and introduced restrictions in unemployment protection, including cuts in the
unemployment benefits and maternity and sick leave benefits, with the aim to address
low labor force participation rates.
The pension system reform, implemented as of January 2011, increased the retirement
age to 67 (from 65 for men and 60 for women), removed incentives for early retirement
and reduced the frequency of pension benefit index calculation from biannually to once
a year.

3.

4.

This year the authorities have initiated social protection system reform, which will,
inter alia, include cuts in the government compensation for maternity leave and sick
leave and introduce private health insurance premium for obtaining full medical
coverage.
Having in mind the importance of foreign investment for this small open economy, the
authorities are particularly dedicated to the business environment reform. Their efforts
resulted in continued progress in various business climate and economic freedom
indicators, according to which Montenegro stands out as the second best performer in
the region (after Macedonia). Nevertheless, the authorities agree with staff that the
business environment needs continued nourishing. In that respect, the Council for the
Elimination of Business Barriers was established for monitoring business environment
progress across the ministries, one-stop shops for business registration were opened and
electronic registration will be introduced by end-June.

EU and WTO accession
International organizations and the European Union all note the significant and sustained
progress on structural reforms, especially in the financial sector, trade, and social sectors. In
particular, the forthcoming start of negotiations for EU membership, tentatively scheduled
for June 2012, represents a confirmation of the authorities’ efforts in achieving the objective
of adhering to the EU principles. Going forward, the EU accession process will undoubtedly
bring additional stimulus for continued reforms in legislative, judicial and economic areas
and provide incentives for foreign investments. Also, in May 2012 Montenegro became a
member of WTO, reflecting the government's commitment and tangible efforts toward open
trade and regional trade collaboration within CEFTA.
Final remarks
The Montenegrin authorities are mindful of the key domestic and external risks presented in
the staff paper, including sizeable external imbalances and fast-growing public debt, and will
continue to use the available policy mix of fiscal and structural reforms to reduce
vulnerabilities, as well as to improve competitiveness and enhance the long-term growth
potential of Montenegro. Given the huge untapped potential in the tourism and energy
sectors, the authorities firmly believe that Montenegro is set to return to a comparably higher
growth trajectory.
