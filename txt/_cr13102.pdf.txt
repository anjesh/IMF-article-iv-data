STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
March 5, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context. Low interest rates and sustained remittances offset weak activity abroad and
real appreciation to raise GDP growth to 6½ percent in 2012. The current account
remained in surplus, supported by remittances and receipts from business process
outsourcing, while inflation fell on peso appreciation and subdued commodity prices
amid a closed output gap. Despite several surge episodes in recent years, capital flows
have generally been modest. Real estate activity is brisk.
The benefits of faster growth have yet to be disseminated to the broader population.
Unemployment and poverty remain stubbornly elevated. The longstanding problems of
poor infrastructure, limited competition, and governance issues have created a climate
that is not conducive to investing in productive sectors or generating well paying jobs,
inducing large overseas employment and, in turn, remittance inflows and real
appreciation.
Outlook and risks. Growth is expected to remain resilient on robust domestic demand,
with inflation within the target band. Adjustment to large persistent inflows is set to
continue, further narrowing the current account. The global economy presents a
downside risk to Philippine growth. On the domestic front, overly rapid credit extension,
with intensified real estate activity and stretched asset prices, could accelerate GDP
growth in the near term, but make it more volatile in the longer run.
Policy recommendations. With macroeconomic conditions on a solid footing, low
interest rates and ample funding should be harnessed to foster sustained, more inclusive
growth, while vigilance and deft policymaking are needed to contain stability risks:








Allowing the exchange rate to continue to move broadly in line with fundamentals
would limit further reserve buildup beyond already very high levels. A mix of tools
should be used to enhance liquidity management and complement interest rate
decisions in strengthening monetary control.
Focusing financial sector oversight on real estate, loan concentration, and nonbank
intermediation would limit the buildup of systemic risks. Broadening and
strengthening the legal authority of the BSP, and raising its capital, are required.
Continuing to mobilize fiscal revenue while stabilizing the deficit at 2 percent of GDP
would fund increased spending for inclusive growth and strengthen resilience of
public finances to shocks.
Improving the investment climate by allowing more foreign ownership, timely and
transparent execution of PPPs, and adopting a continuously rolling medium­term
fiscal plan would promote FDI, expand competition, relieve infrastructure
bottlenecks, and catalyze private investment in productive sectors.

PHILIPPINES

CONTEXT
1.
The Philippines’ macroeconomic fundamentals improved considerably during the past
decade, closing the door on an era of recurrent balance of payments crises. Public debt was
nearly halved, inflation has eased to low single digits, and growth has picked up and become more
stable. Equally important, external vulnerabilities were reduced owing in large part to a reliable
stream of remittances from Filipinos working abroad that shifted the current account consistently
into surplus and allowed the buildup of a large stock of official foreign currency (fx) reserves. As a
result, the Philippines is on the verge of achieving a net external asset position.
2.
However, new macro­financial challenges are emerging, even as legacy structural
issues remain:




Large and relatively stable remittances and service exports, together with smaller but potentially
volatile capital inflows, have been exerting strong upward pressure on the exchange rate. These
have been met with a mix of appreciation and reserve accumulation. Expectations of continued
appreciation and improved investor sentiment toward the Philippines may also be fueling
inflows. Reserves are now very high relative to standard metrics. Low interest rates are pushing
up prices of financial assets and shifting resources to nontradable sectors, including real estate.
Long­standing impediments to stronger and more inclusive growth may exacerbate stability risks.
Concentrated ownership of resources, inadequate public infrastructure, and tight limits on
foreign ownership do not encourage investment into productive activities that could help
sustain future growth or generate sufficient well­paying jobs to absorb the rapidly expanding
labor force. As a result, funds are more likely to be absorbed into liquid financial markets and
real estate, while limited domestic job opportunities have induced large overseas employment
and, in turn, remittance inflows.

3.
The focus on improving governance seeks to strengthen the foundations for sound
policymaking. The government of President Aquino—elected in 2010 for a single six­year term—
adopted the platform of “good governance is good for economics.” In practical terms, this has
translated into programs to reduce poverty, improve tax compliance, and create a more transparent
public sector. In support of inclusiveness, the government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) signed a Framework Peace Agreement in October 2012 that holds the prospect of
reinvigorating growth and reducing poverty in Mindanao region. Mid­term elections for half the
seats in the upper house of Congress and all the lower house seats are scheduled for May 2013.
4.
In concluding the 2011 Article IV consultation, Executive Directors saw the main policy
challenge as safeguarding macroeconomic stability while building the foundations for
stronger and more inclusive growth. Over the past year, the authorities have been proactive in
many of these areas (see Appendix V). Nonetheless, this remained the main theme of the current
consultation discussions.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK AND RISKS
5.
In 2012, the Philippine economy shrugged off weaknesses abroad to grow by more
than 6½ percent, while preserving internal and external stability. Part of the growth pick up
from less than 4 percent in 2011 reflects a surge in exports on product diversification (Box 1);
however, both consumption and especially investment—private and public— expanded rapidly,
fuelled by low interest rates and sustained remittances. These influences are apparent on the
production side, where construction, domestic trade, financial intermediation, and real estate grew
quickly. Meanwhile, the current account maintained a surplus of about 3 percent of GDP, supported
by remittances and business process outsourcing exports—which together totaled 14 percent of
GDP. Inflation moderated through the year, ending at 2.9 percent (3.1 percent in year­average
terms, near the bottom of the 4±1 percent target band), owing partly to strong peso appreciation
amid a broadly closed output gap.
6.
On the external side, the balance of payments surplus moderated on smaller financial
inflows. Official reserves rose by US$8.5 billion in 2012 to US$84 billion (3 times the Fund’s reserve
benchmark for emerging markets), despite a shift to faster nominal effective appreciation
(3.6 percent) compared to previous years. In 2012, the Philippines experienced one of the
largest percentage increases in reserves and one of the largest nominal appreciations against the
U.S. dollar within Asia. Net financial inflows eased last year as both the government and the private
sector shifted from external to domestic financing. However, equity inflows have been strong and
accelerated further in January 2013 on expectations that domestic growth prospects relative to
advanced economies would remain favorable.
7.
Reflecting ample liquidity and the low interest­rate environment, asset prices have
risen rapidly. The Philippines’ stock exchange index rose 33 percent in 2012 and a further 8 percent
during January 2013, with bank share prices jumping 59 percent in 2012. Yields on 3­month Treasury
bills eased further to below 0.2 percent. Nominal prices of high­end residential properties (only
available series) have also been buoyant, rising 8 percent year­on­year, with rents increasing more
than 15 percent. Although slowing from 2011, loans by universal and commercial banks grew at a
brisk 16 percent, funded in part from remittances channeled to banks and drawdown of banks’
deposits at the BSP, but as a share of GDP (31 percent) remain well below the 1997 peak. However,
shadow banking—including through real estate developers—is growing (Box 2).

Staff Position
8.
Growth’s recent resilience is likely to persist, reflecting sustained inflows and the
spillover of exceptionally accommodative monetary policies abroad. Under the baseline
medium­term framework, these factors are expected to continue to cushion the Philippine economy
from lingering sub­par global growth, while keeping inflation manageable and moderating the
current account surplus. GDP growth is forecast to ease back slightly from the elevated pace of 2012
as base effects dissipate, but to remain underpinned by robust domestic absorption. This path
would keep output expanding broadly in line with potential growth, which is expected to increase

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

gradually from 5 percent to 5½ percent reflecting some improvement in the investment climate. The
current account surplus is projected to narrow to 1¼ percent of GDP by 2017 on slower growth of
remittances than of nominal GDP, and rising net imports. Inflation is expected to remain within the
lower half of the target band (to be reduced to 3±1 percent from 2015).
9.
Risks to this outlook could materialize from both external and domestic sources
(Appendix I):




On the external front, extreme events originating in advanced economies or a protracted period
of slow global growth continue to be the main downside risks for Philippine growth. However,
the impact may be more contained than in many other EMs because the economy is less open
to trade, and ample reserves exist to meet portfolio outflows and avoid excessive depreciation.
Remittances provide an additional transmission channel, with depreciation shielding
consumption by raising their domestic purchasing power. However, in the event of persistent
slow global growth that leads to protracted unemployment in host countries, demand for
foreign workers may decline. The resulting fall in remittances would weaken domestic demand
and possibly house prices.
On the domestic side, difficulties absorbing the abundant liquidity into productive sectors could
further drive up asset prices and tilt activity increasingly toward real estate. Under this
medium­likelihood scenario, near­term growth would be faster, but asset prices and GDP
growth could become more volatile over the longer term in response to renewed risk aversion
or higher interest rates in advanced economies. Debt­servicing problems at a domestic
conglomerate—while a low probability event—could lead to sharply higher funding costs,
undercapitalized banks, and a domestic credit crunch that pulls down growth sharply given the
relatively concentrated loan portfolios of many banks.

Authorities’ Views
10.
The recent growth performance of the Philippine economy was seen as mainly
domestically generated. From the demand side, growth was driven by consumption and
government spending while, from the supply side, the industry and service sectors provided the
impetus. The spillover effects from extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy in advanced
economies to emerging markets were duly managed, while spillovers from the European crisis were
seen as coming mainly through trade, rather than monetary or financial channels, and therefore
contributed negatively to Philippine growth. To mitigate this drag, timely monetary and fiscal policy
measures were implemented, made possible by sufficient policy space.
11.
The authorities forecast economic activity to accelerate gradually, accompanied by
faster potential growth that would prevent the buildup of demand pressures. Growth is
projected to rise from 6−7 percent in 2013 to 7−8 percent by 2016. Achieving these growth
objectives while also meeting the lower inflation target from 2015 requires easing existing supply
bottlenecks, supported by rollout of public­private partnership (PPP) projects and infrastructure

upgrades that would enhance productivity growth. Finalization of the Mindanao Peace Agreement
was also expected to spur medium­term growth.
12.
Notwithstanding the positive economic outlook, the authorities remain alert to global
and domestic risks. A global slowdown would likely have a larger impact on the Philippine
economy than would renewed euro area turbulence in view of the limited direct linkages with the
euro area. Growth could also be affected in the medium term if productive sectors are unable to
quickly absorb foreign inflow surges. The ensuing risk of asset price bubbles and/or too rapid
appreciation could compromise growth’s sustainability and dent employment generation.

EXTERNAL SECTOR ASSESSMENT: ACCOMMODATING
ONGOING STRUCTURAL TRANSFORMATION
Staff Position
13.
Sustained large­scale foreign earnings are likely to have caused significant permanent
macroeconomic changes. Persistent remittance inflows and more recently services exports have
raised real permanent income, strengthening demand for both tradables and nontradables. With the
Philippines a price taker for tradables, these changes are consistent with a more appreciated
equilibrium real exchange rate.
14.
Developments in recent years indicate the economy is continuing to adjust to the new
equilibrium. The relative price of nontradables has increased alongside a rising share of
employment devoted to nontradables. These trends are also apparent in the sizable cumulative
REER appreciation since 2004 that has helped to narrow the current account surplus in recent years
(see Appendix II). Nonetheless, from a multilaterally­consistent perspective, staff assesses the
external position to be somewhat stronger than implied by medium­term fundamentals and
desirable policies. As discussed in Box 3, this is compatible with smoothing out the transition, as
evidenced by continued fx intervention despite reserves that are more than adequate for
precautionary purposes. Further adjustment toward equilibrium is expected in the next few years,
facilitated by modest additional real appreciation and stepped­up imports of investment goods.

Authorities’ Views
15.
The peso’s nominal and real effective appreciation in recent years has been driven to a
large extent by structural balance of payments flows. The BSP maintains a presence in the
foreign exchange market to smooth out excessive currency movements, particularly in response to
capital inflow surges, resulting in the continued build up of reserves. In the absence of the BSP’s
foreign exchange operations, it is likely the peso would have exhibited more volatility. The REER has
generally maintained its external price competitiveness against major trading partners, with the peso
having moved in tandem with many Asian currencies in 2012. Notwithstanding, the country enjoys a
robust external position.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PHILIPPINES

16.
The authorities noted that staff’s current external sector assessment differs from
assessments of recent years. In the 2010 and 2011 Article IV consultation discussions, the peso was
judged to have been fairly valued and aligned with fundamentals. In the interim, the peso has
appreciated considerably. This raises concerns about the appropriateness of the methodology
adopted by the staff, which may not adequately capture Philippine­specific factors, such as
remittances.
17.
Structural factors were seen as explaining the high level of reserves and sizable current
account surplus. Because of limited scope for prepayment of government bonds and loans, the
Philippines faces larger net inflows than otherwise. Uncertainty surrounding whether individual
foreign workers will have their employment contracts renewed triggers a precautionary saving
motive. With no facility to pool this idiosyncratic risk, and despite little aggregate risk,
economy­wide saving is therefore pushed up. In addition, weakness in the investment climate has
created a timing mismatch between receipt of external inflows and subsequent investment
spending, leading to the accumulation of reserves. The current account will narrow as the economy
expands and once barriers to investment are removed. Thus, the positive current account gap
should be seen in the context of structural factors that may not require currency adjustment to
eliminate.

POLICIES FOR STABILITY AND INCLUSIVE GROWTH
A. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
Background
18.
Short­term market interest rates have fallen to exceptionally low levels. Moderating
price pressures during 2012 allowed the inflation­targeting BSP to lower the policy rate by a
cumulative 100 basis points to 3.5 percent. Nonetheless, market rates remain disconnected from the
policy rate, with yields on government bonds with maturities up to 5 years falling below the policy
rate (Box 4). Over the past 18 months, the BSP amended a range of policy tools to discourage
speculative activity and reduce sterilization costs, including: (i) ceasing remuneration of required
reserves; (ii) prohibiting external funds from its Special Deposit Account (SDA)—a short­term facility
with a balance equivalent to nearly US$40 billion (16 percent of GDP)—and lowering the rate below
the policy rate; (iii) raising capital charges and introducing limits on banks’ nondeliverable forward
(NDF) positions; and (iv) curtailing its fx forward book (counterpart to one leg of banks’ forward
positions).

Staff Position
19.
Transmission of policy rates is hampered by lax monetary policy in advanced
economies and liquidity overhang from past reserve accumulation. In this setting, a single
policy tool is not sufficient to simultaneously deliver inflation, growth and systemic financial stability
goals. The BSP’s weakening capital position is an additional consideration. The authorities’ decision
to reduce their participation in the fx market, and to adopt and/or

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PHILIPPINES

amend in a timely manner a variety of macroprudential instruments aimed at tightening monetary
conditions to mitigate financial stability risks, is welcome. While effectiveness of these measures is
difficult to definitively assess, and the link between the policy rate and short­term market rates may
have been disturbed, the measures taken over the past 18 months have reduced the attractiveness
of certain forms of financial intermediation that were growing rapidly and have since slowed or
declined.
20.
Going forward, managing current inflows and absorbing the liquidity overhang from
past interventions through a package of reinforcing measures are priorities to strengthen
monetary control:






Diverting and absorbing inflows: The government has contributed to moderating inflows by
scaling back external borrowing, but there is scope to go below the 20 percent target on the
external share of gross borrowing for 2013. Recent amnesties by the BSP allowing foreign
repatriation of investment proceeds should be made permanent to facilitate outflows of
“trapped” funds, together with making the import payment regime more flexible. Recourse to
capital flow measures may be warranted at some point if macroprudential tools are not able to
contain financial stability risks. Further developing long­term financing instruments may
facilitate absorption of resources into productive uses, including those with a high import
content in order to moderate net inflows.
Exchange rate policy: The exchange rate should continue to move broadly in line with
fundamentals, which would also limit further reserve buildup and sterilization needs. However,
halting intervention may abruptly appreciate the peso, intensifying perceptions of a one­way bet
in the context of persistent structural inflows, depriving firms of time needed to achieve
productivity gains. Accommodating normal appreciation pressures, but leaning gently against
the wind of unusually strong pressures, is recommended, together with greater exchange rate
flexibility at fairly short horizons.1
Liquidity management: The large volume of short­term BSP liabilities makes liquidity
management vulnerable to shifts in market sentiment. Recent initiatives to enhance coordination
of asset and liability management within the broad public sector could deliver efficiency gains
and greater specialization along the maturity spectrum of debt (with the government focusing
on the longer end). More generally, shifting from passive sterilization to an actively-managed
interest rate corridor with variable-rate instruments (including BSP bills) may improve liquidity
control.

21.
The capital position of the BSP should be strengthened to allow it to effectively
implement policy and sterilize liquidity. The ₱20 billion (0.2 percent of GDP) capital injection in
the BSP in late 2012 is a welcome incremental step. However, the current arrangement of
1

needed capital cushions.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PHILIPPINES

asymmetric profit sharing and unpredictable capital top­ups detracts from operational
independence for monetary policy (Box 6). Replacing it with a legally­mandated system of automatic
loss compensation or stipulating a minimum level of capital is preferred.

Authorities Views
22.
Traditional monetary policy instruments need to be complemented with
macroprudential policy tools amid sustained capital flows. As in other EMs, the BSP has
expanded its policy toolkit and will introduce new instruments and make refinements as conditions
warrant. The BSP continues to inhabit the middle ground of exchange rate regimes, participating in
the fx market to smooth out excesses. Given existing scope to further adjust macroprudential
policies (such as levying reserve requirements on SDAs), no need for capital flow measures was
anticipated at the current juncture. However, the BSP continues to keep its options open should
circumstances arise that may require capital flow measures. The large amount of short­term BSP
liabilities was not considered problematic, and these are managed with a variety of instruments.
Closer cooperation between the BSP and government on liability management has been helpful in
expanding the range and maturity of liquidity­absorbing instruments. Amending the Central Bank
Law to allow the BSP to issue its own securities and ensure adequate capitalization would provide
additional flexibility to manage liquidity.

B. Financial Sector Policies
23.
Background. The financial sector continued to perform well in 2012, although weaknesses
are present. Regarding banks, profitability was robust, the NPL ratio continued to decline, capital
adequacy remained strong, and credit growth was brisk. Loans by universal and commercial banks
grew by 16 percent to a still­moderate 31 percent of GDP. Banks are beginning to orient new
lending to households where margins are wider, which will over time dilute high loan concentrations
to corporate groups. Nonbank financial intermediation also grew rapidly, with strong activity in IPOs,
bond issuance, and financing through real estate developers. Nonetheless, household and corporate
sectors remained large net savers in the aggregate. About 80 percent of new residential
construction (by number of units) is in the low­middle price bracket. Of these, about half are
reported to be purchased pre­construction by overseas foreign workers (OFWs).2 Legal responsibility
for preserving financial stability is not assigned. Legislative changes aimed at rectifying critical
AML/CFT weaknesses identified by FATF were recently adopted.
24.
Staff’s position. The BSP’s generally proactive approach to oversight of the banking sector
and emphasis on sound bank governance are welcome. The introduction of Basel III capital
requirements from January 2014 is an appropriately counter­cyclical measure. Since 2006, the BSP
has adopted a risk-based supervisory approach, and resolved some 160 weak banks. However,
developing an escalating Prompt Corrective Action and bank rehabilitation framework—as
recommended in the 2010 FSSA Update—remain priorities. Moreover, banks’ increasing exposure to
2

OFWs bear the direct fx risks, and the risk of possible nonrenewal of short­term employment contracts.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PHILIPPINES

real estate (RE) and sustained large exposures to individual borrowers remain a concern, while the
rapid development of nonbank financing carries risks.






Real estate: Expanding the coverage of banks’ RE exposure monitored by the BSP (to include
bank’s equity positions and loans to thrift banks for RE onlending) and agreeing with banks
voluntary guidelines on “contract­to­sell” financing for real estate developers are welcome. The
inter­agency Financial Sector Forum’s initiative to gather information on all sources of real estate
finance is also commendable. However, several risks are apparent. Real estate developers may
apply less­stringent lending standards and more­generous loan terms than required of banks,
including on loan­to­value (LtV) (the standard cap is 60 percent) and by offering initial teaser
terms. Some banks may also not be in full compliance with LtV limits. In addition, no institution
has oversight responsibility for the housing sector from a macro­financial perspective.3 Several
macroprudential measures are therefore recommended to contain the buildup of risks in this
sector. The existing 20 percent limit on a bank’s real estate exposure under the narrow definition
should be applied to the more comprehensive measure. Prudent loan origination standards and
existing regulations should be strongly enforced, supported a comprehensive positive credit
registry, conservative debt­to­income guidelines for retail borrowers, and granting an explicit
legal mandate to an appropriate institution for stability aspects related to the RE sector. A
counter­cyclical capital charge on RE, a general provisioning requirement on newly­issued RE
loans, taxing RE transactions, and lower LtV limits would be warranted if RE supply­demand
imbalances get further out of line.
Loan concentration: Banks’ declaration of large exposures to consolidated clients under
recently­strengthened governance requirements has aided the BSP’s preparation of
“conglomerate maps.” These maps may reveal larger exposures to individual related borrowers
than previously recognized and permitted ceilings. With a handful of large conglomerates
following broadly similar business models, and bank exposures to them equivalent to a sizable
share of total bank capital, systemic risks are heightened. The earlier relaxation of the single
borrower limit (SBL) for petroleum purchases and PPP financing further expands conglomerates’
access to credit, reinforcing risks and the economy’s already concentrated ownership structure.
It is therefore advised to begin to roll back all SBLs (defined to encompass affiliated entities) to
the standard 25 percent through effective sunset clauses and, where a consolidated borrower
exceeds applicable limits, require banks to develop—and agree with borrowers—credible plans
for timely reduction of excessive exposures. Specific provisions should also be applied in
proportion to the SBL breach, consistent with the Basel Committee’s pronouncements.
Rapid growth of nonbank financial intermediation provides a welcome deepening of local
financial markets, which until recently have been dominated by banking. However, diversification
could have the unwanted effect of shifting intermediation to segments subject to data gaps and

less­stringent regulatory standards and oversight. The FSF is therefore urged to continue to fill
in data gaps, including on corporate leverage and currency exposure; however, because the FSF
has no separate legal authority, staff recommends amending the BSP’s charter to permit it to
request and receive information on all members of conglomerate groups so it can review the
main activities of the group that may have a material impact on the soundness of the bank, and
take appropriate supervisory action. Enhancing legal protections for BSP supervisors to protect
them from litigation related to the conduct of their duties and relaxing the “extraordinary
diligence requirement” is essential to allow effective execution of supervisory functions.
25.
Authorities’ views. The authorities broadly shared staff’s assessment of the financial sector.
An active and broad reform agenda is being pursued to prevent the buildup of sector risks. The
recent extension of the SBL in the case of PPP financing reflects delayed initiation of the projects.
The BSP monitors loan concentrations closely and has enhanced reporting requirements for entities
that exceed their limits. To continue to effectively manage financial sector risks, they hoped that
approval of the amended BSP charter—including broader supervisory authority and stronger legal
protection of supervisors—would be promptly granted.

C. Fiscal Policy
Background
26.
A broad set of reforms is underway to make the fiscal position more resilient and raise
policy effectiveness. The Philippines’ revenue­to­GDP ratio is low compared with peers, despite
relatively high rates on some taxes (e.g., CIT), reflecting in part exemptions and extensive tax
incentives. Moreover, interest costs have tended to absorb a sizable share of revenue, compressing
room to spend on health, education, and infrastructure.4 The authorities have embarked on major
fiscal and governance reform, as detailed in the 2011−16 Philippine Development Plan. This
encompasses revenue mobilization through tax policy and tax administration reform, boosting social
and infrastructure spending, introducing means­tested social programs (e.g., conditional cash
transfers) and universal health insurance, budget process reform (e.g., zero­based budgeting), and
strengthened oversight of government­owned corporations.
27.
The government is committed to generating additional revenue to fund priority
spending while continuing to pursue further debt consolidation. The deficit is estimated to have
widened by 0.2 percentage points in 2012, to 2.3 percent of GDP. This reflected a jump in
investment spending from 2011, partly offset by stronger revenue collection from ongoing tax
administration reforms, revenue buoyancy, and improved spending efficiency. Excises on tobacco
and alcohol (“sin taxes”) were raised from 2013, yielding 0.3 percent of GDP, and will be used to
further expand health insurance coverage for low­income households. For 2013−16, the authorities
are targeting a deficit of 2 percent of GDP while raising the revenue­to­GDP ratio to 18 percent
(from 14.3 percent in 2012) and the tax ratio to 16 percent (from 12.8 percent in 2012) in order to

At around 2¾ percent of GDP, annual public investment spending is very low relative to infrastructure needs.

create space for new spending. Pension spending for uniformed personnel will rise from ½ percent
of GDP in 2012 to ¾ percent of GDP in 2016 in the absence of reform.

Staff Position
28.
Staff endorses the authorities’ fiscal strategy for the period 2013−16. This would permit
additional resources for social and infrastructure spending in support of faster, more inclusive
medium­term growth. Further resources will be made available under planned PPPs (currently
projects amounting to 2 percent of GDP are in the pipeline), but related contingent liabilities and
other risks should be carefully monitored and included in the fiscal accounts (Box 6). Under the
staff’s baseline scenario, the deficit path is consistent with national government primary surpluses of
½−1 percent of GDP that are expected to lower the debt ratio to 44 percent of GDP by 2016.5 While
this implies a fairly rapid debt reduction path, even at the expected 2016 level, the debt­to­revenue
ratio would remain relatively high compared to other EMs (although on a par if measured against
GDP, and lower if measured against GNI, Box 7). Moreover, debt service costs and the gross
financing requirement relative to tax revenue would remain elevated (55 percent and 70 percent,
respectively, Box 8). Refinancing debt, lengthening maturities, and continuing to reduce external
borrowing would further strengthen resilience to shocks.
29.
Staff supports the authorities’ dual approach to mobilizing the ambitious, but
necessary, additions to revenue. Strengthened tax administration and compliance offer the
prospect of sizable revenue gains. Improvements in handling return filings, data processing, large
taxpayer service, audit, and arrears management are important markers of progress. Accelerating
the reform momentum is essential to ensure that critical milestones, including rollout of new IT
systems by end­2013, are met. However, yields from administration reform are unpredictable in
terms of amount and timing. Staff therefore also recommends reforming the tax system by
broadening bases, reducing exemptions and allowances, and taxing currently under­taxed activities.
This should include rationalizing tax incentives for the corporate sector, introducing a fair and
sustainable fiscal and regulatory framework for the natural resource sector, and raising excises on
petroleum.

Authorities Views
30.
Steady progress has been made in implementing the authorities’ broad fiscal strategy.
This includes reform of tax administration, overhaul of “sin” taxes, increased social spending with
expanded coverage of conditional cash transfers and health insurance for the poor, budget process
reform, and performance­based bonuses for government employees. Procedures for executing
infrastructure projects were also improved, ensuring timely implementation. The government
remains committed to the 2 percent of GDP deficit target through 2016, but may allow a larger
deficit in the event of a global shock.

In cyclically­adjusted terms, fiscal policy is expected to be broadly neutral in 2013.

On mobilizing revenue, immediate priorities are tax and customs administration
reform and amending the mining tax law. To identify revenue foregone from tax incentives
awarded to firms, the government is requiring beneficiaries to report the amount of tax incentives
granted, with the aggregate tax expenditures to be presented in budget documents. They are also
considering measures to enhance tax compliance by the self­employed and professionals, and
establishing a minimum presumptive value for each shipping container that enters the country, to
be taxable at customs. Regarding mining, adopting a regulatory and fiscal regime that achieves
equity, transparency, and environmental sustainability will bring growth to underdeveloped regions
and a reliable new source of fiscal revenue.

D. Structural Policies to Sustain Growth and Boost Inclusiveness
Background
32.
Sustaining growth. A notable improvement in the business climate was registered in recent
years, but progress has been uneven. The Philippines advanced ten positions in the past year to 65th
place in the World Economic Forum’s 2013 Global Competitiveness Rankings, mainly on improved
public institutions and reduced red tape and corruption, although it remains in the bottom half of
the sample on these factors, while infrastructure is seen to be in a poor state. On the other hand, the
improved macroeconomic environment and large domestic market are seen as important strengths.
Separately, concentration of resources and strict limits on foreign ownership in a broad set of
sectors and across all professions have held back FDI to low levels, especially compared to other
countries in the region.
33.
Enhancing inclusiveness. The incidence of poverty remains stubbornly high (above
26 percent on the national definition as of 2009, but around 40 percent on the ”less than US$2 per
day” measure). The unemployment rate has been stuck around 7 percent since the GFC—
considerably higher than in neighboring countries, while underemployment stands at 19 percent.
Despite robust economic expansion during 2012, employment shrank by nearly 900 thousand.

Staff Position
34.
Continuing to improve the investment climate would help channel savings into
productive activities and promote more sustainable growth. Relaxing limits on foreign
ownership could substantially raise FDI—particularly as integration within ASEAN and other
multilateral groupings is set to deepen—and increase competition in key sectors.6 Timely and

6

Nicoletti and others (2003) find that removing foreign equity ceilings is the most important potent way to raise FDI,
and removal of such ceilings could increase FDI significantly (by nearly 80 percent). The positive impact of FDI on real
growth through, inter alia, transfer of technology and management practices is well­documented (see papers cited in
IMF 2012, “Liberalization and Management of Capital Flows”). For example, Aizenman and Sushko (2011) find that
higher levels of FDI lead to an increased probability of a growth take off. There is also strong evidence that greater
competition raises growth. For example, Aghion and others (2009) find that increased entry into an industry
promotes innovation and productivity of the incumbents.

transparent execution of Public­Private Partnership (PPP) and large government investment projects
could help catalyze private investment by signaling impartiality and effectiveness of
decision­makers, while relieving infrastructure and energy constraints. Adopting a continuously
rolling medium­term fiscal framework, instead of one that extends only to the end of the current
Presidential term, would inform the private sector of the government’s future development
priorities, providing critical guidance for private projects with long gestation periods. As such, it
could help prevent the “stop­start” growth episodes observed in previous decades. In addition,
effective use of the anti­money laundering framework would support the authorities’ efforts to
detect and deter corruption.
35.
Domestic job creation is key to achieving inclusive growth and reducing incentives for
emigration and dependence on remittances that have come to complicate the policy
environment. Existing initiatives to expand access to formal credit by micro firms, SMEs and the
agriculture sector—all of which are labor intensive—encourage employment by lowering the cost of
entrepreneurship. Improving the job­readiness of the labor force is also crucial, and recent measures
extending the number of years of compulsory schooling from 10 to 12 and widening the coverage
of health insurance and the conditional cash transfer (CCT) program help meet immediate basic
needs and support a more productive labor force in the future.7 More generally, transitioning to a
growth path where gains are more widely shared requires fundamental change to the business
environment, but which could become self­sustaining once a critical mass of reforms has been
implemented. The authorities are therefore urged to push ahead with significant and broad­based
improvements to the investment climate.

Authorities Views
36.
The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to faster, more inclusive growth,
supported by improved governance. They acknowledged the economy’s recent jobless expansion,
and indicated that making the economy more investment and industry­led were priorities to
generate more high­quality jobs and sustain growth over the medium term. PPPs were seen as a
support for sustainable growth, and project rollout had therefore been deliberate to ensure the
process was transparent and well structured. Several PPPs focus on improving transport
infrastructure, and hence provide conditions conducive to future productivity and employment
growth. ASEAN integration was expected to offer new opportunities, increasing competition even in
the absence of new domestic entrants, and also attracting additional FDI. While some restrictions on
foreign ownership are specified in the constitution, and may therefore be difficult to amend,
approval of an anti­trust bill is pending.

7

The CCT program, first introduced in 2008, will be further expanded in 2013 to cover 3.8 million households, at a
budget cost of about 0.4 percent of GDP. Family benefits depend on children’s school attendance and mothers’ and
their young children’s regular health check­ups.

STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
Macroeconomic fundamentals are on a solid footing, but the long­standing challenge
of fostering inclusive growth remains. Large inflows from abroad are therefore a mixed blessing,
providing the opportunity to undertake productive investments to sustain future growth and make it
more equitable, but bringing a stronger real exchange rate and the risk of excesses in financial and
real estate markets that could lead to future volatility.
38.
The Philippine economy has weathered the volatile global environment well, and the
outlook is favorable. Over the medium term, growth is expected to remain resilient on robust
domestic demand brought by low interest rates and sustained remittances. This should insulate
against sub­par global growth. The current account is forecast to moderate further, with inflation
remaining within the target band, supported by a modest increase in potential growth.
39.
This growth outlook is subject to two­way risks. A protracted period of slow global
growth or a large adverse demand shock in a major country or across a class of countries pose the
main downside threat for the Philippine economy in the near term. On the domestic side,
overly­rapid credit expansion, coupled with intensified real estate activity and stretched asset
prices—possibly driven by a capital inflow surge—could accelerate GDP growth in the near term.
However, a subsequent unwinding would likely have large negative macroeconomic effects over the
longer run. In this context, concentrated loan portfolios of banks and increasing leverage of
corporates could pose a risk to macro­financial stability.
40.
The Philippine economy is continuing to adjust to the large persistent inflows coming
from abroad. The real exchange rate has risen strongly in recent years and the current account
surplus has moderated. While the external sector is seen as somewhat stronger than warranted by
medium­term fundamentals and desirable policies, further narrowing of the current account
expected over the next few years would close the remaining gap.
41.
Transmission of domestic policy interest rates has been weakened by low interest rates
abroad and ample domestic liquidity. The BSP has increasingly relied on a variety of tools to
tighten monetary conditions and preserve macro­financial stability. The decision to shift the policy
mix more toward currency appreciation than in the past is welcome, supported by the timely and
targeted use of macroprudential policies.
42.
A reinforcing set of policies is needed to manage current inflows and absorb liquidity
from past interventions. The exchange rate should continue to move broadly in line with
fundamentals, limiting further reserve build up beyond already high levels, but leaning gently
against the wind in response to unusually strong appreciation pressures. Continuing to coordinate
asset and liability management within the public sector, with the government focusing on the longer
end of the yield curve and further reducing its foreign borrowing, would enhance liquidity
management. Permanently liberalizing remaining regulations on fx outflows and developing
long­term financing instruments would moderate and more effectively absorb inflows. Recourse to
capital flow measures may be needed if macroprudential tools appear insufficient to contain stability
16

risks. Predictable arrangements for ensuring adequate BSP capital are essential to support
operational independence for monetary policy.
43.
Financial sector oversight has generally been proactive, but supervisory gaps
embedded in law may limit scope to contain risks. Early adoption of Basel III capital requirements
is a welcome counter­cyclical measure. Amending the BSP charter to widen the supervisory
perimeter to include conglomerate parents of banks, while ensuring strengthened legal protection
for supervisors, is necessary to preempt systemic risks related to real estate, shadow banking, and
large bank exposures to connected corporate entities. Assigning responsibility for the preservation
of financial stability is also needed. Ensuring prudent loan origination standards, applying the
existing cap to the new broader definition of bank’s real estate exposure, and strongly enforcing
existing prudential regulations are essential. Further tightening macroprudential policies may be
needed if real estate activity and/or credit continue to grow rapidly. Applying single borrower limits
to all affiliated entities and beginning immediately to gradually to unwind exemptions would ease
macro­stability risks from concentrated exposures. Recent actions to address AML/CFT weaknesses
identified by FATF are welcome, and full use of the AML framework should be made to support
anti­corruption efforts.
44.
The continued focus on mobilizing fiscal revenue will help fund spending in support of
sustained and inclusive growth, while strengthening resilience to shocks. The government’s
ambitious revenue goals are appropriate. This would allow the deficit to stabilize at around
2 percent of GDP—corresponding to a broadly neutral stance in 2013—and thereby reducing the
debt service burden, while creating significant room for new spending on infrastructure and social
needs. While strengthened tax administration and compliance could yield considerable revenue,
timing is uncertain, and parallel efforts to broaden tax bases, reduce exemptions and allowances,
and better tax currently under­taxed activities should continue. The recent increases in excises on
tobacco and alcohol are therefore welcome.
45.
Significant, broad­based improvements to the investment climate would make growth
more persistent and support domestic job creation. Existing micro­ and agri­finance initiatives
and expanded basic social care and compulsory schooling support entrepreneurship and a more
productive labor force. However, the investment to GDP ratio remains subdued. Allowing more
foreign ownership, executing PPPs in a timely and transparent manner, and adopting a continuously
rolling medium­term fiscal plan would promote FDI, expand competition, relieve infrastructure
bottlenecks and catalyze private investment in productive sectors.
46.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12­month cycle.

Box 1. Philippines: Declining Import Intensity of Growth
Over the past decade, the import intensity of Philippine GDP has come down substantially. As a share of nominal GDP,
imports dropped from close to 55 percent to 35 percent.
The decline in the import share was accompanied by a falling export share. The drop of shares in nominal terms includes
the effect of peso appreciation and changes in world prices. In real terms, the magnitudes are much smaller, but still
notable.

diversification from manufactures to agricultural and mineral products (which also have high domestic content) has
occurred. Further, the composition of manufactured goods is shifting from highly import­intensive electronics to products

Box 3. Foreign Exchange Management in the Philippines:
The Role of Remittances and Capital Flows
International reserves have risen substantially over the last decade. Using a relatively standard
foreign exchange reaction function, we explore empirically the underlying factors driving foreign
exchange intervention, focusing on possible different responses to capital flows and remittances.
Because the BSP is an inflation targeting central bank, we explicitly include the inflation rate as an
additional explanatory variable.
There is evidence that the BSP “leans against the wind” to moderate exchange rate changes and
volatility driven by portfolio flows and, to a lesser extent, remittances.1/ Intervention—proxied by the
overall balance of payments—is found to be larger when the peso is appreciating in nominal
effective terms and exhibiting greater volatility. Portfolio and other financial flows and remittances
are associated with significant reserve accumulation, but with a larger response in the case of the
former. There is also evidence that reserve accumulation is weaker when inflation is higher,
suggesting a role for the exchange rate in delivering the inflation target. On the other hand,
deviation of the real exchange rate from trend is not found to be a significant determinant of
intervention.
These findings are consistent with the BSP’s stated practice of participating in the market to smooth
exchange rate volatility, with a larger response to speculative (hot money) flows than to structural
(remittance) flows. Nonetheless, some intervention in response to the much larger remittance than
financial inflows is needed to explain the rapid increase in the reserve stock, especially in recent
years. This conclusion accords with a recent statement by the BSP Governor that “we can allow some
currency appreciation for structural flows.”

_________________________________________
1/ For sterilized intervention to affect the exchange rate, controls on outflows and/or imperfect substitutability of
foreign and domestic assets is needed. However, if sterilization is only partial, then intervention can affect the
exchange rate in the absence of capital controls or imperfect substitutability of assets.

Box 5. Philippines: Sterilization Practices—A Cross­Country Perspective
Sterilization costs for many emerging market central banks have likely increased in recent years on rising international reserves and
possibly­widening gaps between domestic and foreign interest rates. These costs arise from the desire to withdraw part of the liquidity created
through fx intervention in order to contain inflation pressure and the risk of asset price bubbles. Sterilization liabilities issued by the central bank—if
held voluntarily by the private sector—generally pay a domestic interest rate that exceeds the yield on the central banks’ fx reserves. The resulting
net interest loss could in some circumstances reduce monetary policy’s flexibility and, if persistent, run down central bank capital. Realized losses
from fx depreciation are an additional cost.
Central banks use a variety of instruments to sterilize liquidity:


Reserve requirements—the proportion of liabilities banks must deposit at the central bank—may be remunerated or unremunerated, and can be
a low­cost form of sterilization if no or low interest rates are paid.



Central bank bills withdraw liquidity at the short­end of the yield curve. Such bills are usually issued at market rates.



Standing deposit facilities lock up liquidity equal to demand at the specified interest rate. An alternative is an auctioned deposit facility, where
the rate is market determined.



The central bank may sell its holdings of government securities (at the opportunity cost of foregone interest income), but the central bank’s stock
of securities is finite and may be exhausted quickly in an environment of sustained excess liquidity.



The central bank can use its forward or swap book to temporarily affect liquidity conditions.

In several countries, the fiscal authorities play an explicit role in sterilization, with or without incurring related costs:
In India, where the RBI is not permitted to issue its own securities, it may do so for sterilization purposes on behalf of the government, up to a limit
approved by parliament. The proceeds are then deposited at the RBI in an unremunerated “market stabilization scheme” account, and the
government pays the interest cost on the securities. In Colombia, the Treasury issues “sterilization” bonds to the market. The collected funds are
deposited at the CBR, which pays interest on them. Hence, this operation does not impact the government’s finances, but overcomes the CBR’s
limited supply of sterilization instruments.
1/

Governments may also incur sterilization costs as a result of legal arrangements on central bank recapitalization or profit sharing. There is no
consensus on the minimum level of capital a central bank should maintain, and it is feasible for a central bank to operate effectively with negative
capital for an extended period (e.g., Chile). This may account for why automatic frameworks for central bank recapitalization are relatively rare (one
exception is Indonesia, where the government is required to support a minimum level of central bank capital). However, many countries have
symmetric profit­loss sharing arrangements, whereby central bank losses are compensated by transfers from the budget (e.g., Malaysia). In Brazil,
the BCB receives treasury bills through recapitalization operations, which are conducted whenever the BCB’s operating income is negative. The BCB
uses these treasury bills to conduct sterilization operations. However, even in the absence of formal arrangements, because the central bank is part
of the consolidated public sector, its losses are therefore a fiscal obligation.
In the Philippines, the main sterilization instrument is the BSP’s Special Deposit Account (SDA), a deposit facility open to banks and the private sector
(subject to minimum deposit amounts), with maturities ranging from 7 days
to 1 month. Interest rates have historically been close to the policy rate

As a result of the wide domestic­foreign interest differential, sterilization
costs have risen. For 2012, the loss is projected at 0.9 percent of GDP,
partially offset by a capital injection of 0.2 percent of GDP that is part of a
multi­year 0.5 percent of GDP recapitalization, of which four­fifths has been
done. Under current BSP Law, 75 percent of BSP profits are transferred to
the budget, but there is no automatic fiscal compensation in case of losses.

Box 6. Philippines: Public Investment and Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs)
Public investment is low in the Philippines. The public expenditure review by the World Bank pointed
out a significant gap in public investment, noting that it is lower in the Philippines by almost
4 percent of GDP than in regional peers. This does not bode well for rapidly improving the
Philippines’ poor current state of infrastructure. Low fiscal revenue has been the major constraint to
raising public investment.

Box 7. Philippines: GDP Versus GNI: What Difference Does It Make?
Gross domestic product is typically used to measure a country’s level of development and is the
benchmark against which domestic and external sustainability are assessed. However, in some
countries, GDP differs substantially—either positively or negatively—from gross national income (GNI),
which is the sum of domestically­generated income (GDP) and net income received from abroad. GNI
may therefore be a better measure of a country’s repayment capacity, and using that concept may
provide a more evenhanded approach to cross­country comparisons. Also, for countries where
indebtedness is high, the choice of scaling factor may affect whether or not sustainability thresholds are
breached.
In the Philippines, large­scale emigration has led to sizable foreign­sourced income. As a result, GNI is
considerably larger than GDP. Official GNI data is 30 percent larger than GDP. However, this includes
total compensation of all Philippine nationals working abroad—even those with longstanding links to
other countries and who primarily spend their incomes abroad. A more appropriate measure of GNI is
to supplement GDP only with income and transfers that are remitted back to the Philippines and are
therefore available domestically. On this definition, and staff’s assumption that unreported remittances
are half of officially­recorded remittances, GNI is about 15 percent larger than GDP.

Using GNI instead of GDP provides a somewhat
more favorable picture of the Philippines’
standard of living, debt sustainability, and external
sector position. While the differences are
generally not large, with GNI, some indicators
may fall below specific thresholds—for example,
the public debt ratio is reduced below 50 percent.

Assessing repayment capacity should rely on
permanent income, thereby giving less importance
to temporary sources of income. For the Philippines,
whether or not to include remittances as part of
permanent income depends on their time­series
properties relative to GDP and their likely
persistence. Remittances have grown steadily over
the past decade. Also, push and pull factors that
underpin emigration and repatriation of remittances
can be expected to continue over the medium to
longer term.

Nimble debt management by the government improved
the public debt profile and reduced gross funding
requirements. The government has successfully financed
its operations mainly from medium­ and long­term
domestic debt. Moreover, it has conducted debt swaps
to lengthen maturities and issued global peso bonds
since 2010. As a result, the share of short­term debt in
national government debt decreased from 15 percent
in 2003 to 6 percent in 2011, and the share of
fx­denominated debt declined from 51 percent in 2003
to 40 percent in 2011.1/ The gross funding requirements
of the national government shrank from 22 percent of
GDP in 2003 to 9 percent of GDP in 2012.

Philippines: Contributions to Changes in Nonfinancial Public
Sector (NFPS) Debt

2003

The Philippines has succeeded in almost halving the
public sector debt ratio over the past decade.
Nonfinancial public sector debt (general government
debt plus debt owed by nonfinancial public corporations)
decreased from 96 percent of GDP in 2003 to 56 percent
of GDP in 2011. The bulk of the debt reduction took
place in years preceding the Global Recession, thanks to
primary surpluses, high output growth, and exchange
rate appreciation. Over the medium term, the
government’s deficit target of 2 percent of GDP will
translate into primary surpluses of ½−1 percent of GDP
for the national government and anchor further
reduction of public debt to 44 percent of GDP by 2016.

On the other hand, a cross­country comparison indicates
vulnerabilities still exist. While public debt and gross
funding requirements as percent of GDP are close to the
average of emerging market countries (and lower if
measured against GNI), they are higher than for peers if
measured against government revenue. Moreover,
dependence on external debt is still high compared to
ASEAN countries (except Indonesia), China, and India.

1/ The share of fx debt in NFPS debt declined from 68 percent in 2003 to 48 percent in 2011. The fx share is somewhat
higher at the NFPS level than at the national government level owing to foreign borrowing by state­owned companies and
netting out of domestic currency debt held by the “bond sinking fund” (part of NFPS, but not national government).

 High unemployment in
Europe could reduce OFWs
working there, lowering
remittance inflows.

growth prospects, Philippines
could see higher financial
inflows.

 External financing becomes

 Financial sector exposure to

Low

 Default by one part of a
group on its foreign

 With a handful of large
conglomerates following
broadly similar business

heightened.

Expected Impact of Risk
Medium
 Direct exports to Europe account for
12 percent of total exports (2.6 percent
of GDP), while exports to the
U.S. account for 15 percent of total
exports. Indirect trade channels are likely
to dominate. However, the import
content of exports is high, mitigating the
effect on GDP.
 Financial exposure to Europe is fairly
limited. European banks' claims on
Philippines amount to 7 percent of GDP
(about 3 percentage points from UK
banks), but this includes deposits
collected locally to fund local lending.
However, capital outflows are likely to
tighten monetary conditions, including
through higher market interest rates.
 Nearly one­fifth of OFW remittances are
derived from Europe, two­fifth are from
the United States. Some decline in
remittances from several affected
countries was seen during previous
phases of the euro crisis.
Low/Medium
 Philippines has been diversifying exports
away from advanced economies to Asia,
and this process will continue.
 Cost-saving by firms in advanced
countries will shift back office activities
abroad, benefiting the Philippines'
Business Process Outsourcing sector.
 Given the region's better growth
prospects, the flow of funds from
advanced economies into Asia and the
Philippines will continue. This could
sustain upward pressure on asset prices.
Low
 While prices of equities and securities
have risen sharply, real estate prices
have just begun to pick up.
 Falling real estate prices may increase
banks' NPLs, but effect on capital should
be manageable.
 Domestic credit is funded largely from
remittances, rather than through capital
markets. This will help banks avoid
funding pressures, avoid a large credit
crunch, and insulate domestic demand.
Medium
 Near-term growth rises strongly.
 Vulnerability of the financial system
gradually builds.
 Asset price correction through financial
accelerator channel weakens growth.

Medium
 Loans to entire group are written down,
causing a major reduction of bank
capital. Reduced bank capital could
create a domestic credit crunch.
 Concerns arise about the profitability
and liquidity of other major
conglomerates, raising their funding
costs.

Recommended Policy Response
 Ample space exists for a strong
monetary and fiscal stimulus.
 With abundant international reserves,
intervention should be used to
prevent excessive depreciation that
would stoke inflation. However, some
weakening of the exchange rate
should be permitted.

 Undertake structural reforms,
including improving the investment
climate, to boost domestic demand.
 Adjust macroprudential policies as
needed to limit risks related to
elevated asset prices.

 Same as above.
 Ensure banks have adequate capital
buffers.

 Preemptively tighten monetary
conditions and macroprudential
policies as needed to prevent
elevated asset prices.
 Ensure adequate bank capital to
absorb credit losses.

 The BSP should proactively roll back
banks' single borrower limits,
underpinned by credible agreements
between the banks and the
conglomerate.
 In case of default, rapidly recapitalize
banks to prevent disruptive
contraction of credit.
 Avoid regulatory forbearance at
banks and fiscal transfers to the
affected conglomerate.

Appendix II. Philippines—External Sector Developments and Assessment
Current Account (CA)
Since shifting into surplus in 2003, the CA peaked at 5 percent of GDP, supported by remittances
from Filipinos working abroad and, more recently, exports of services, but has narrowed to around
3 percent of GDP since 2011. Excluding remittances, the CA remains in deficit (around 5 percent of
GDP). Compared with the pre­Asian crisis period, the improved CA reflects a higher saving rate
alongside a lower investment rate.

Effective Exchange Rate (EER)
In contrast to the volatility of previous decades, since 2004, the real EER has been on an upward
trend, appreciating by 5 percent per year on average. The pace of appreciation accelerated in 2012,
with the index now close to its previous peak in the late 1990s. Recently, the Philippines’ REER has
strengthened much faster than those of its close neighbors (Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand).
Meanwhile, the nominal EER has been relatively flat.

Financial Account
The financial account has tended to run a small positive balance, but saw modest outflows in 2009.
Portfolio flows and “other investment” dominate the financial flows, but these often move in

41

PHILIPPINES

opposite directions. FDI is small. In 2012, the financial account surplus was much lower than the
previous year on weaker debt inflows. The authorities are liberalizing restrictions on capital outflows
and import prefinancing.
Reserve Accumulation, Reserve Adequacy, and Net IIP
Gross international reserves increased from US$20 billion in 1990 to US$83.8 billion (33.5 percent of
GDP) at end 2012, with much of the accumulation occurring since 2004. Reserves now stand at
3 times the Fund’s reserve adequacy metric for EMs, against a benchmark of 1 to 1½ times, and a
higher multiple than for most other EMs. This suggests the Philippines holds more reserves than is
warranted to meet normal expected contingencies. Reserve buildup continued in 2012, but at a
slower pace than in recent years.

The net international investment position (IIP) had a small negative balance at end 2011 (latest
data), amounting to 8.7 percent of GDP. Continuation of recent external sector trends is expected to
shift the net IIP into surplus in the coming years. Total external liabilities amount to 57.6 percent of
GDP (US$130 billion), with official reserves sufficient to cover two thirds. In turn, nearly half of
liabilities correspond to portfolio investment, with a further third reflecting other investment
liabilities. FDI liabilities are about 20 percent of total external liabilities.
Pilot External Balance Assessment (EBA) and CGER1
According to the Fund’s pilot EBA methodology, the Philippines’ CA was larger than predicted
in 2012, suggesting the external sector could be stronger than warranted by medium­term
fundamentals. The gap rises once deviations of domestic and foreign policies from their desired
values are taken into account (although the policy gaps are mainly due to the rest of the world). This
gap first opened in 2001, and has since widened. On the other hand, EBA’s REER approach suggests
the external sector could be weaker than warranted by medium­term fundamentals since 2006, with
a real overvaluation at end 2012. This seemingly inconsistent pattern of results is not unique to EBA,
as shown in the 2011 Article IV report that was based on the CGER methodologies, and continues to
hold under the latest CGER update.

1

This section is based on Fund staff analysis in the IMF, External Balance Assessment (EBA): Data and Estimates from
the Pilot Exercise (http://www.imf.org/external/np/res/eba/data.htm), and thus is preliminary.

42

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PHILIPPINES

Technical factors suggest that in the Philippine case, more weight should be given to the CA result
than to the REER result. This is because the EBA REER regression cannot capture the effect on the
REER of the rise in permanent income due to remittances (see below). Moreover, the model relies
heavily on comparing current with past levels of the REER, making the result sensitive to the sample
period used.1
Impact of Remittances
Remittances from Filipinos working abroad have grown strongly over the past 10 years, and
officially­recorded personal remittances have risen to near 10 percent of GDP. This reflects large
labor emigration (currently some 10 percent of the population are overseas Filipinos, with some
12¼ percent of the labor force classified as overseas foreign workers). Relative to the counterfactual
of no workers abroad and no remittance inflows, consumption of imports and nontradables is likely
higher. Thus, the equilibrium REER would tend to be more appreciated and the trade balance
smaller (i.e., more negative) then otherwise. Remittances are therefore analogous to the “transfer
problem” of war reparations and “Dutch disease” from natural resource booms. Consistent with
adjustment to the more appreciated equilibrium, the relative price of nontradables, share of
employment devoted to nontradables, and the actual REER have risen in recent years. The
magnitude of the rise in the equilibrium REER depends on numerous factors, including preferences
and the expected persistence of remittance inflows.

1

Because the REER is an index of prices, making cross­country comparisons infeasible, country dummies are included
in the regression. As a result, for each country, the residuals sum to zero over the sample period. With the actual
REER having exhibited large swings and having been on an upward trend in recent years, the fixed effect leads to a
fitted series that is both flatter than the actual REER, and under predicts recent REER appreciation. Therefore, the
REER model result of overvaluation may in large part be a consequence of the methodology, rather than reflecting
fundamental economic considerations.

Whether recipients perceive remittances to be temporary or permanent can affect spending
behavior. According to the permanent income hypothesis, only permanent income is consumed
each period. Therefore, if remittances are expected to be short­lived, a large part would be saved to
support consumption following the dry­up of inflows. Thus, when remittances are seen as
temporary, the equilibrium real appreciation would be smaller, and the current account surplus
larger, than when remittances are perceived to be long lasting.
Staff expects that remittances will remain sizable for the foreseeable future. While conditions in host
countries and the nominal exchange rate path will be important determining factors, continued
rapid growth of the working­age population (2 percent per year until 2025), elevated unemployment
and under­employment at home, rising remittances per foreign worker, and a still­large wage gap
with host countries are expected to sustain labor outflows and remittance inflows over the
medium to long term.
The current view that remittances are perceived to be persistent differs from the approach in
the 2010 and 2011 Article IV consultations, where from a very long­term perspective, slowing
population growth and a constant retirement rate were forecast to gradually reduce outward
migration, causing remittances to fall to 5 percent of GDP by 2050. In the face of a long­term
decline in remittance receipts, intertemporal consumption smoothing would call for increased
saving in the short and medium term.1 On the assumption that saving behavior targets a future
income stream equal to a constant real per capita annuity, this implies additional saving of—and a
smaller current account gap by—2.2 percent of GDP in 2016 (the reference period for the
assessment under CGER in the previous staff report), although the results are extremely sensitive to
how the annuity is specified.2 This additional saving was seen as sufficient to bring the forecast
medium­term CA into line with the medium­term norm (1.8 percent of GDP). Note that under EBA,
the reference period is shifted to the current year.3
1

This is analogous to the treatment of revenue from natural resources with a finite stock and/or high price volatility.

2

See Box 2 of IMF Country Report No. 11/59 for further details.

3

For 2011, the implied additional saving under this approach was 1.5 percent of GDP, and the CA norm was
0.9 percent of GDP (against an actual CA of 3 percent of GDP).

44

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PHILIPPINES

Revisiting EBA—GNI versus GDP
Philippine gross national income (GNI) is significantly larger than GDP, which could materially impact
the external sector assessment. Whereas for most countries the difference between GNI and GDP is
modest, in the Philippines, GNI is about 15 percent larger owing to remittances that supplement
residents’ domestically­generated income.1 Irrespective of whether income is sourced domestically
or received from abroad, it is income—rather than GDP—that is the appropriate basis on which
saving and investment decisions are made. This implies that the current account scaled by GNI,
rather than GDP, should be the basis for assessing the Philippines external sector.2 Several other
variables used in EBA, such as social spending, fiscal policy, and the per capita income gap, would
also be better measured relative to GNI.
Rescaling the current account and relevant EBA regressors by GNI narrows the EBA regression gaps.3
On the current account, this reflects both a reduction in the actual current account ratio and an
increase in the fitted value, with the unexplained regression residual declining to 2.9 percent of
GDP.4,5

1

While official data put remittances currently at 10 percent of GDP, survey­based data indicate unregistered
remittances are about 50 percent higher than those coming through official channels and captured in statistics. In
calculating GNI, staff assumes that total remittances are 1½ times the officially reported amount (currently
15 percent of GDP). This GNI concept differs from the one used by the National Statistics Office, which assumes all
overseas foreign workers (OFWs) are residents, and includes all their income earned abroad in GNI, resulting in GNI
exceeding GDP by about 30 percent in 2012. However, this would tend to significantly overstate the amount of
resources available to people residing in the Philippines because many OFWs have longstanding ties to their host
countries and consume much of their income abroad.
2

While we assume underreporting of remittances, we consider the current account to be correctly measured. This is
because the overall balance of payments is given independently by the BSP’s fx intervention, and the financial
account is—if anything—also underreported. The implication is that actual imports are considerably larger than
officially documented. This accords with anecdotal evidence on customs receipts and Global Financial Integrity’s 2012
report that finds evidence of over­reporting of the trade balance, based on cross­checking with partner country data,
of about 6½ percent of GDP.
3

Because EBA is estimated on a large set of countries for which GDP is close to GNI, the estimated EBA coefficients
remain valid.
4

The implied REER overvaluation narrows slightly to about 11 percent. However, the caveat regarding inclusion of a
fixed effect remains valid, and hence the CA approach is regarded as more informative.

5

The regression residual is based on the observed CA and the model predicted CA, both evaluated at actual policies.
The current account norm is defined as the predicted CA evaluated at desired policies, while the total EBA gap is the
sum of the regression residual and the contribution of policy gaps.

Remittances may also affect the current account through the precautionary saving channel. Despite
only moderate fluctuation of remittances at the aggregate level, overseas workers may perceive
considerable idiosyncratic risk associated with possible nonrenewal of work contracts. No
information is publicly available on the incidence of contract nonrenewal for incumbent workers.
However, balance of payment data suggest that one quarter of remittances are derived from
workers with contracts of less than one year.1 With no facility to pool individual risk, the saving rate
for foreign workers on short­term contracts may be higher than otherwise.2 Due to insufficient data,

1

Close to half of overseas workers are classified as being on temporary employment contracts (of unspecified
duration), with most of the rest being immigrants or legal permanent residents abroad whose stay does not depend
on work contracts. Hence, some unknown share of temporary overseas workers who are on short­term contracts may
be affected by the heightened precautionary saving motive.
2

On average since 2008, some 37 percent of households with an overseas worker report that some (unspecified)
share of remittances is allocated to savings.

46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PHILIPPINES

quantifying this effect is not feasible, although it could potentially have a measurable impact on
aggregate equilibrium saving.
Overall Assessment
Developments in recent years indicate the economy continues to adjust to the new equilibrium.
While numerical approaches may not adequately incorporate all relevant country­specific
considerations, including the rise in permanent income and that household cautiousness induces
them to save part of the permanent income gain, staff is of the view that the external sector is
currently somewhat stronger than warranted by medium­term fundamentals and desirable policies.
However, further narrowing of the current account forecast over the medium term is expected to
restore the external sector to equilibrium.
Implications of Different Reference Periods
Under previous Fund approaches, the reference period for assessing the external sector was the
medium term. Under EBA, this is brought forward to the current year. This change affects staff’s
assessment for the Philippines: while the external sector is seen as “somewhat stronger” in 2012, it is
recognized that the economy is continuing to undergo transition, although at a moderating pace.
This is reflected in staff’s medium­term projections, and by 2017, it is expected that the external
sector will be in line with medium­term fundamentals and desired policies.1

1

This was also the case in the prior assessments, where the CA was above the implied norm in 2010 and 2011, but
the combination of a rising norm and a moderating CA were expected to close the gap by 2016 (the previous
reference point).

Appendix III. Philippines—Debt Sustainability Analysis
The outlook for public debt dynamics is favorable. Nonfinancial sector public debt has declined from
96 percent of GDP in 2003 to 56 percent of GDP in 2011. Based on the government’s medium˗term
objective of a national government deficit to 2 percent of GDP, public debt is projected to continue
this declining trend to 42 percent of GDP by 2017. Gross financing need is also expected to decline
from 15 percent of GDP in 2010 to 9 percent of GDP by 2017. If the deficit were to remain 1 percent
of GDP higher than currently projected or if medium˗term growth were lower by 1 percent, the
decline in public debt would be more gradual and debt levels would remain at about 46 percent of
GDP through 2017. Given the high share of foreign currency debt (about 48 percent), the main
vulnerability arises from exchange rate risk.
Projected external debt dynamics are also favorable. In recent years, external debt has steadily
declined, from nearly 80 percent of GDP in 2001 to below 35 percent of GDP at end­2011. Under the
staff’s baseline scenario, the external debt ratio is projected to continue decline in the medium term,
as a result of current account surpluses. Further, the debt dynamics appear to be resilient to various
shocks: one­half standard deviation shocks to interest rate, growth, and the current account lead to
only a modest deterioration in the debt ratios over the medium term. However, exchange rate
volatility remains a vulnerability as a one­time real depreciation of 30 percent in 2013 would imply a
15 percent jump in external debt ratio.

Appendix IV: Philippines—Staff Policy Advice from the 2010 and 2011 Article IV
Consultations
Staff Advice

Policy Actions
Fiscal

Strengthen excise taxes, rationalize fiscal incentives, and address
inefficiencies in the VAT (2010 and 2011).

Congress approved in 2012 a law to rationalize excise tax on alcohol and tobacco.
The law raised excise tax rates, simplified product categorization, and introduced
inflation indexation for the tax rates, in line with recommendations of IMF TA.

Manage the civil service wage bill to avoid crowding out other
priority spending (2010 and 2011).

There will be no adjustment in the pay scale for government employees in 2013, after
salary increases under a 4­year salary standardization program were completed
in 2012.

Establish a medium­term budget framework (2010).

The medium­term fiscal framework was presented in the Philippines Development
Plan for 2011–16. It has not been updated since.

Monitor fiscal risks of PPPs carefully and reflect them in the fiscal
accounts (2010 and 2011).

The authorities issued a resolution that provides for the preparation of a contingent
liability management plan by implementing agencies, training for project evaluation
and contingent liability assessment, and full disclosure of the required budget for
contingent liabilities that will become real liabilities.

A substantial increase in benefit payments for uniformed
personnel needs to be managed in a fiscally sustainable
way (2011).

Inter­governmental discussions are underway.

Financial, Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
Monitor potential pressure points, including concentration and
interest risks at banks, real estate exposures of nonbanks, and
channels for inward spillovers from global financial turbulence
(2010 and 2011).

The BSP strengthened banks’ governance requirements and prepared “conglomerate
maps” to monitor concentration risks. Monitoring of the banks’ exposure to the real
estate sector was enhanced, including through collaboration with other agencies
under the auspices of the Financial Sector Forum. Single borrower limits were
increased in case of the public­private partnerships (PPP).

Further strengthening the supervisory and regulatory framework
as well as the AML/CFT regime (2010 and 2011).

Measures to address weaknesses in the AML/CFT regime were recently adopted.

Passage of amendments to the Central Bank Act that would
strengthen liquidity management and enhance policy
effectiveness, including through increasing legal powers and
protection for the supervisory authorities, and enhanced
supervision of banks’ conglomerate exposures. (2010 and 2011).

The amendments to the central bank act have not been passed by the legislature.
Basel III capital requirements will be introduced in January 2014.

Scope for further flexibility of the exchange rate in response to
sustained inflows (2010 and 2011).

In 2012, the authorities allowed the policy mix to shift more toward currency
appreciation than in the past.

Need an appropriate mix of policy tools to manage capital inflows
and monetary conditions, while facilitating productive use of
these inflows (2010 and 2011).

A range of macroprudential policy tools is being used to tighten monetary
conditions.

Structural
Building faster and more inclusive growth. Promoting private
investment and addressing impediments to job creating and
productivity are crucial for raising potential growth (2010
and 2011).

Initiatives have been introduced to expand access to formal credit for small and
medium size enterprises and the agricultural sector. Recent measures to extend
compulsory schooling from 10−12 years and expand healthcare and the CCT
program will help support a more productive labor force. Efforts to improve
governance should strengthen the foundations for sound policymaking.

VII. Exchange Arrangement:
The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating, while the de facto exchange arrangement is
classified as floating. The value of the Philippine peso is determined in the interbank foreign
exchange market; the Bangko Sentral intervenes in the spot and forward markets in order to smooth
undue short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate and to strategically build reserves. Philippines has
not introduced any new exchange measure that could give rise to multiple currency practices and
maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for

IMF-WORLD BANK COLLABORATION
(As of February 26, 2013)
Background
The Bank and the Fund country teams on Philippines exchanged views to coordinate the teams’ work
during 2013 through the resident representative’s office and headquarters missions. The teams
agreed on Philippines’ main macroeconomic challenges to navigate the uncertain global
environment to maintain macroeconomic stability, create policy space to meet future potential
shocks, and build the foundations for faster and more inclusive growth. Based on this shared
assessment, the teams identified three structural reform areas as macro­critical, in view of their
central role in achieving sustained inclusive growth: (1) raising investment, including public sector
capital spending; (2) strengthening public finance and social safety nets; and (3) the financial sector.
Table 1 details the specific activities planned by the two country teams over the period
January 2013˗December 2013, along with their expected deliveries, and the division of labor.
The Key Areas with Joint Programs
Strengthening Public Finance
The continued focus on mobilizing fiscal revenue help fund spending in support of sustained and
inclusive growth, while strengthening the resilience to shocks. The Fund and the Bank have a long
standing program of support for strengthening public finance and involve close coordination in
support of tax administration reforms in the Bureau of Internal revenue; tax policy reform including
fiscal incentives rationalization; management of fiscal risks; debt management strategy;
strengthening the fiscal unit in the Department of Finance (focused on assessing and strengthening
customs and BIR performance); and support for the Bureau of Treasury’s lead role in implementation
of a Single Treasury Account (TSA).
Financial Sector
A joint Bank/Fund Financial System Stability Assessment took place in 2009, following up on the
initial joint FSAP in 2002. Following the FSAP recommendations, the Fund has focused on technical
assistance in bank supervision. The bank has taken the lead in nonbank financial sector. Joint areas
of interest are banking sector soundness, and capital market development.
No disagreement among the two teams emerged on either the key issues, challenges or on the
division of tasks to tackle these. It was agreed that further details on collaboration, as necessary,
would be agreed at the technical level as work progresses. The teams have the following requests
for information and collaboration from their counterparts:

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PHILIPPINES



The Fund team requests to be kept informed of progress in World Bank’s discussions with the
government on financing of infrastructure, PPPs, and implementation of the development policy
loan. Review and sharing of analytical work, in particular the annually prepared Philippines
Development Report (PDR), would be welcome, in addition to follow up from the 2010 FSAP,
and on work related to the reform of social safety nets, public expenditure reviews, and public
financial management.



The Bank team requests to be kept informed of the Fund’s assessments of macroeconomic
policies and prospects and to coordinate closely the technical assistance work, especially in
areas such as tax policy and administration, where the Bank has an existing program in place, as
well as in public expenditure analysis and management, where extensive Bank work is ongoing.
The Bank would welcome participation in the Article IV consultation and other relevant IMF
mission.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of February 11, 2013
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision to the Fund has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
National accounts: As part of a World Bank-funded project, Improving the Quality and Usefulness of the Philippine
System o f National Accounts, the National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB) rebased the national accounts
from 1985 to 2000. Continuing improvements include on-going efforts to fully implement the System of National
Accounts, 2008. Despite the authorities’ efforts to improve quality, weaknesses remain in the national accounts. These
include the coverage of the GDP and the statistical discrepancies in the GDP estimates between the expenditure and
production sides. The authorities are working on improving (i) the accuracy of the GDP volume measures; (ii) the
coverage of the public corporations sector; (iii) the accuracy of the quarterly GDP data; and (iv) the adoption of
benchmark techniques to reconcile quarterly and annual national accounts estimates. The NSCB is currently
participating in the IMF Statistics Department’s Project on the Implementation of the System of National Accounts and
the International Comparison Program, funded by the Government of Japan. This three-year technical assistance
project provides assistance to improve the quality of the national accounts and price statistics.
Price statistics: In July 2011, the National Statistics Office introduced a rebased consumer price index (CPI). The
updated CPI is compiled using weights based on the 2006 Family Income and Expenditure Survey. Data from
the 2008 Commodity and Outlet Survey were used to augment the provincial market baskets. One important
methodological change implemented in the updated CPI is the adoption of the internationally recommended
Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose (COICOP) for the classification of all items. As noted in the above
section, assistance will be provided to improve the quality of price statistics in Philippines.
External sector statistics: Steps have been taken to improve the quality of balance of payment statistics. In 2005, the
Central Bank of Philippines (BSP) created a Department of Economic Statistics, with one of its units to concentrate on
compiling, analyzing, and publishing the balance of payments and the international investment position. Since
deregulation in the early 1990s, international transactions have increasingly flowed through nontraditional channels
that are not adequately covered by the statistical reporting system. The authorities have introduced new data
sources, including the Cross Border Transactions Survey and administrative-based reporting systems to address
coverage issues, but challenges remain. The Foreign Currency Deposit Units (FCDUs), which account for about
70−75 percent of foreign exchange settlements, are exempt from reporting requirements because of strict banking
secrecy rules.
Monetary and financial statistics: Compilation of monetary and financial statistics (MFS) largely conforms to the
Fund’s methodology.
Government finance statistics: Provision of fiscal data is broadly adequate for surveillance. Major areas for
improvement include detailed data for levels of the public sector beyond the national government as well as
transition of fiscal data reporting to the GFSM 2001 format. Fiscal Transparency ROSCs were conducted in 2002
and 2004.

II. Data Standards and Quality
Philippines subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standards
(SDDS) in August 1996.

A data ROSC was published in
August 2004.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
April 18, 2013

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with the
Philippines
On March 29, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Philippines. 1
Background
In 2012, the Philippine economy shrugged off weakness abroad to grow by more than
6½ percent, while preserving internal and external stability. This reflected strong consumption
and investment, fuelled by exceptionally­low interest rates and sustained remittances, as well as
continued export product diversification. The current account surplus remained around
3 percent of GDP supported by remittances and business process outsourcing exports, while
inflation moderated to 3.1 percent in year­average terms.
Large and stable inflows from abroad contributed to the cumulative 10 percent real appreciation
since end 2009. Despite the larger-than-expected appreciation of the peso last year, reserves
still rose by about US$9 billion. In total, they remain high—at the equivalent of 34 percent of
GDP. Capital inflows moderated in 2012 relative to the previous year, but picked up in
early 2013.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.
1

2
Financial and real estate markets have been buoyant. Equity prices rose by one third in 2012,
bank credit and other sources of financing are growing briskly, while short­term T­bill rates have
dropped below 0.2 percent. Real estate activity is proceeding quickly, although price growth
remains in the single digits.
Despite the strong economic performance over the past decade, the benefits have not
permeated the broader population. Unemployment is around 6¾ percent—high from a regional
perspective—and the poverty rate remains stubbornly elevated. The weak investment climate of
poor infrastructure, limited competition due to tight restrictions on foreign investment and
concentrated ownership, and continued red tape and corruption are seen as contributing
factors.
Policies are geared to maintaining stability and supporting sustained and inclusive growth. The
Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) has reduced its policy interest rate while utilizing a broader
range of tools than in the past to respond to easing domestic inflation pressures and low interest
rates abroad. The fiscal stance was mildly supportive of growth in 2012. The government is
undertaking reforms to raise fiscal revenue while increasing social and infrastructure spending
and lowering the debt ratio. In the financial sphere, oversight and regulation of the real estate
sector has been stepped up. Expanded social programs will help meet basic needs, while
numerous Public­Private Partnership projects in various stages of preparation are intended to
alleviate infrastructure­related growth bottlenecks.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities’ prudent policies which have delivered strong
macroeconomic outcomes and set the stage for favorable economic prospects for the near
term. However, Directors noted risks associated with global uncertainties, volatile capital
inflows, banks’ increasing exposure to some sectors, and the possibility of stretched asset
prices. Accordingly, they stressed the importance of continued prudent policy implementation
and stepped up reforms to bolster resilience, sustain high growth, and reduce poverty.
Directors welcomed the broadening of the policy toolkit to strengthen monetary control and
preserve macrofinancial stability. In this context, they noted that authorities’ participation in the
foreign exchange market continues to be limited to smoothing excessive volatility, and urged
that the exchange rate continue to move broadly in line with fundamentals. Careful deployment
of macroprudential measures will be key to managing inflows and risks of asset price bubbles.
Directors highlighted that arrangements to ensure adequate central bank capital will be
essential to support operational independence of monetary policy.
Directors commended the generally proactive financial sector oversight. Further steps to close
supervisory gaps, including by broadening the central bank’s authority to allow supervision of

3
conglomerate parents of banks and strengthening legal protections for supervisors would help
mitigate systemic risks from real estate, shadow banking, and concentrated credit exposures.
Directors welcomed recent actions to address weaknesses in the regime to combat money
laundering and the financing of terrorism.
Directors endorsed the authorities’ continued focus on further strengthening the fiscal position
over the medium term. Efforts to improve tax administration and compliance, broaden the tax
base, and reduce exemptions will be necessary to generate budgetary space for infrastructure
and social spending. Recent increases in alcohol and tobacco excises are welcome steps in this
direction.
Directors noted with satisfaction some improvement in the business climate. However, to
sustain strong growth, increase domestic job creation, and reduce poverty, they saw the need
for further reforms geared toward increasing investment, improving infrastructure, and
enhancing governance. Directors agreed that the expanded coverage of public health care,
conditional cash transfers, and longer compulsory schooling would help meet immediate basic
needs and support a more productive workforce. To catalyze private investment, Directors
encouraged the authorities to relax limits on foreign ownership, execute public-private
partnerships in a transparent manner, and strengthen the medium-term fiscal framework.

Statement by Der Jiun Chia, Executive Director for the Philippines
and Alphew Cheng, Advisor to Executive Director
March 29, 2013
1.
Since the last Article IV Consultation, Philippine authorities continued to
implement sound macroeconomic policies that sustained investor confidence and supported
economic growth. Policy efforts and resulting economic gains were affirmed by improvements
in investor confidence, credit ratings, and competitiveness rankings. Despite the positive
developments, authorities recognize the need for continued vigilance against global uncertainties
and risks associated with capital flows. Authorities are determined to preserve and capitalize on
the gains achieved through good governance and sound policies, and are committed to push for
more reforms that will help reduce unemployment and promote a sustainable and more inclusive
growth. In this regard, authorities thank the staff for highlighting the risks to the economy and
for sharing useful insights during the conduct of the 2013 Article IV Consultation.
Recent Developments
2.
Despite the continued weakness in the global economy, the country enjoyed strong
growth in 2012. The services sector, including trade, rentals and business process outsourcing,
remained the main driver of growth. A sharp rebound in the industry sector was also seen on
account of the expansion in manufacturing and construction. On the expenditure side, consumer
demand maintained its strength while government spending picked up with increased outlays for
public construction and social programs.
3.
Growth was supported by a stable macroeconomic environment. Average inflation
rate for 2012 was recorded at 3.2% and fiscal deficit was kept under 3.0% of GDP. The current
account and the BOP continued to post surpluses, with remittance flows from overseas Filipinos
rising by 6.3% year-on-year, exhibiting resiliency amid global developments. International
reserves continued to increase and external debt ratios improved. The banking system also
remained sound, registering steady growth in assets, deposit base and capital, as well as
improvements in asset quality.
4.
Although growth had been strong, labor markets showed little improvement.
Unemployment rate remained close to 7.0% and underemployment hovered around 20.0%.
Authorities took steps to improve the labor market, for example, through the identification of indemand professions and skills, trainings to address skill mismatches, and other community-based
employment programs. While improvements are expected given the growth momentum, moving
forward, authorities believe that more effort is needed, particularly in encouraging investments
and creating more jobs.
Policy Actions
5.
Authorities adopted a broad policy framework to facilitate growth of the economy
while at the same time allowing for buffers to ensure stability. This include (i) consolidating
the fiscal position, but with strengthened social and infrastructure spending through better tax
administration and collection; (ii) strengthening debt sustainability through lengthening maturity
and shifting towards domestic financing; (iii) adopting a supportive monetary policy in light of

2
manageable inflation expectations and increasing potential output; (iv) strengthening financial
institutions to support credit growth needed to sustain economic expansion; and,
(v) implementing structural reforms to promote investments and more inclusive growth.
6.
During the year, fiscal authorities improved revenue and tax efforts to increase
resources for infrastructure and social spending. Authorities instituted programs to strengthen
tax compliance and intensified efforts to run after back taxes to ensure permanent improvements
in future tax collections. Authorities are working to put in place electronic systems to improve
tax and customs administration. Authorities are also moving to enhance the transparency of fiscal
incentives as a step towards removing redundancies and inefficiencies. Moreover, authorities are
working with industry representatives to study options for the mining sector’s fiscal regime to
enable the government to receive its fair share of mining revenues.
7.
Meanwhile, authorities introduced new budget procedures to ensure the consistency
of programs with the country’s development plans and the prompt disbursement of funds
to line agencies. Authorities also established a performance-based incentive system to promote
meritocracy and good public service delivery. For 2013, authorities introduced the policy for the
one-year validity of appropriations to enhance predictability of funding requirements. Preprocurement activities were allowed to be undertaken upon budget submission to facilitate faster
project implementation.
8.
On the financing of the fiscal deficit, authorities continued to actively manage
liabilities to minimize interest expense and provide fiscal space for budget priorities.
Authorities engaged in liability management exercises that lengthened the duration of
government debt and reduced the foreign exchange exposure of and the dependency on external
debt by changing the borrowing mix in favor of local sources. In addition, authorities are
committed to work closely with market participants to continue developing the domestic bond
market. Authorities have recently rationalized the auction schedule in response to market
developments. Authorities are moving to deepen bond market liquidity by establishing a unified
market for taxable and tax-exempt bondholders.
9.
Amid the benign inflation outlook and to encourage investment activities, monetary
authorities reduced policy rates by a total of 100 basis points in 2012. In April 2012, the
central bank successfully transitioned to the rationalized reserve requirement regime that helped
simplify compliance and monitoring, and ensured adequate liquidity in the financial system. In
July 2012, monetary authorities clarified that the special deposit account (SDA) facility, which is
a monetary policy tool intended to absorb excess domestic liquidity, should not be made
available for opportunistic investment activities funded from non-resident sources. In
January 2013, the authorities adjusted the SDA facility by reducing its interest rate below the
policy rate, consistent with the monetary authorities’ continuing efforts to fine-tune the
operations of the central bank’s monetary policy tools. Over the medium term, they view the
move as a possible transition towards introducing an interest rate corridor framework for
monetary policy operations. In relation to this, monetary authorities thank staff for the recently
concluded technical mission to study the adoption of this new monetary policy implementation
framework, and will consider staff suggestions. In March 2013, to continue with the fine-tuning
operations given the benign inflation outlook, they decided to set the interest rate on reverse
repurchase facility at the same rate of 3.5% for all tenors, and reduced the SDA rate further.

3
10.
Consistent with the desired lower inflation path, authorities reduced the mediumterm inflation target for 2015-2016 to 3.0% +/- 1.0%. The move reflects authorities’ view on
the favorable trends in the structure of inflation, the lower exchange rate pass-through, and the
expected higher capacity of the economy for growth under a low inflation environment.
11.
To ensure the stability in the provision of credit, the central bank enhanced the
governance standards of financial institutions through new regulations. It emphasized the
need for Board members of financial institutions to exercise objective judgment and to ensure a
stronger system of checks and balances. It also revised the compliance programs of banks to
strengthen the credibility of the banking system. Further, it announced the adoption of Basel III
capital adequacy rules for universal and commercial banks by 2014. Authorities continue to work
with legislators on the amendment of the central bank’s charter to strengthen the supervisory
powers of the central bank. The amendment will be delayed until the next Congress is convened
after the elections this coming May. They also continue to strengthen the monitoring of
exposures of the financial system to the real estate sector and conglomerates. For example, in
August 2012, the central bank approved new reporting guidelines to provide a more
comprehensive measure of a bank’s real estate exposures. Authorities will remain vigilant to
ensure that banks apply prudent credit standards while financing the growth of the economy.
12.
Alongside the strengthening of financial institutions, authorities continued to
actively pursue policies for inclusive finance. Authorities implemented rules promoting more
transparency in lending and facilitated the widening of products for microenterprises. In addition,
authorities continued to promote financial education through the establishment of learning
centers, and ensure access to credit by mapping out financial service access points. To comply
with international standards, authorities also continued to update laws relating to anti-money
laundering, with the most recent update done in February 2013.
13.
Authorities showed their commitment and ability to deliver major reforms with the
passage of key legislations in late 2012. These include the reproductive health, the “sin” tax,
and the 2013 budget laws. The reproductive health law aims to improve living standards of poor
families that are often burdened with more children than could be supported, and to allow the
government to reallocate subsidies to such families to other critical budgetary items, such as
education, health care and economic services. Meanwhile, the excise tax reform on tobacco and
alcohol is expected to expand the revenue base of the government and to cover the financing
requirements for a universal health care program. As for the 2013 budget, social services,
particularly education, will receive the biggest allocation, while infrastructure program and other
capital outlays will continue to support economic development.
Outlook and Risks
14.
Despite concerns about spillovers from the external environment, authorities are
optimistic for 2013. Authorities believe that growth can accelerate in 2013 as Private-Public
Partnership projects move into implementation phase, while tourism, business process
outsourcing and manufacturing sectors continue to expand. Inflation is expected to remain within
target in 2013, and authorities deem the current policy stance appropriate. Authorities view that
the benign inflation outlook allows room for monetary policy to remain supportive of economic
growth. To protect the domestic market from further weakness in the global economy, authorities

4
see the need to nurture domestic demand and intra-regional trade. Hence, structural reforms will
be geared towards tapping domestic and regional sources of growth. These include accelerating
infrastructure development, ensuring the adequacy and efficiency of power supply, and
enhancing administrative efficiencies to improve competitiveness. Also, authorities believe that
macro-prudential policies can help ward off the build-up of imbalances and asset-price
misalignments brought about by global liquidity and capital flows. Authorities remain committed
to allow the exchange rate to be determined by market forces, but will also guard against
excessive exchange rate volatility that could undermine economic growth.
15.
Moving forward, authorities reiterate their commitment to deliver policies that will
promote strong and inclusive growth, in line with the Philippine Development Plan. They
will continue to ensure that good governance is observed in the bureaucracy and continues to
serve as the backbone for economic growth. Macroeconomic stability will be preserved through
strong fiscal discipline, prudent monetary policy, and pro-active financial sector regulation.
Policies will continue to help improve the investment climate and to sustain strong growth, while
providing buffers against external and domestic shocks. Further, growth will be made more
inclusive with continuing programs for financial inclusion, consumer protection, public health,
education, housing, employment and conditional cash transfers. Authorities remain firm in their
commitment to the Millennium Development Goals. In this regard, authorities express their
appreciation for the technical assistance extended by various development partners, including the
Fund.
