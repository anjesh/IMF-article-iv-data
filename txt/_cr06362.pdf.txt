Past surveillance: The outgoing government had started implementing a reform
agenda along the lines of Directors’ comments at the conclusion of the last
Article IV consultation on September 28, 2005
(http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/np/2005/pn05142.htm), although progress on
structural reforms was slow due to difficulties in gathering political support,
entrenched interests, and capacity constraints.

•

Exchange system: The Solomon Islands accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2(a), 3, and 4 in 1979. Exchange restrictions reintroduced starting in 2000
were removed in 2003 and the exchange system is now free of restrictions on the
making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. The
currency is de facto pegged to the U.S. dollar.

•

Data: Despite remedial measures, data quality, coverage, and timeliness remain
weak, hampering surveillance.

•

Publication: As last year, the authorities indicated that they intend to publish the
Article IV documents.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Economic Developments and Challenges
•

Since the intervention of the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands,
growth has rebounded and financial stability has been maintained. Since 2003, per
capita real GDP has increased about 3.5 percent per year. Strong donor-funded and newly
started private sector projects, together with high oil prices, have shifted the current
account into a wide deficit, but reserve coverage has been boosted by aid and foreign
direct investment inflows. Due to rising oil prices, expatriate demand pressures, and brisk
private credit growth, inflation is in the high single digits. For the third year running, the
budget is projected to record a surplus in 2006 due to investment underspending and
revenue overperformance, but low-priority spending is rising.

•

Raising living standards requires addressing pressing challenges. New private
activities to replace logging which is expected to run out in about six years need to be
jump-started—a daunting task amidst deep-rooted obstacles to private investment, weak
institutions, and rapid population growth. Progress will depend on the vigor of structural
reforms, and maintaining macroeconomic and political stability.

Key Policy Issues
•

The 2007–10 national development strategy should translate the government’s
objectives of “governance plus growth” and the Millennium Development Goals into
concrete policies. The strategy should be country-led, implementable, and incorporate all
programs/projects. It should also serve as the key mechanism for aid coordination.

•

Fiscal discipline should be sustained and a medium-term strategy developed taking
into account looming pressures. The expected decline in logging and import duty
revenue needs to be offset, while the high wage bill should be strictly controlled to
accommodate higher investment spending. Reforms to broaden the tax base and reduce
cascading, address state-owned enterprises’ (SOEs) inefficiencies, and enhance public
finance management should be pursued. As the country remains at high risk of debt
distress, ongoing efforts to regularize debt are welcome. Fiscal decentralization should be
approached carefully and without weakening public finances.

•

The central bank’s current exchange rate policy is appropriate, while the CBSI
should remain vigilant on inflation. With strong foreign inflows, the currency has been
stabilized versus the U.S. dollar, but downward pressure on the exchange rate should be
accommodated. The CBSI should strengthen its inflation forecasting and take measures if
inflation pressures intensify or reserves come under pressure.

•

Financial system soundness should be strengthened mainly by liquidating the
development bank and raising the profitability of the National Provident Fund.
Plans to broaden access to financial services should be commercially-oriented.

•

Structural reforms to encourage new private sector activities should be vigorously
implemented. Strengthened governance, SOE restructuring, and infrastructure provision
should have priority.

5
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The economy has performed well in the past three years, although raising living
standards remains a formidable challenge. Since the Regional Assistance Mission to the
Solomon Islands’ (RAMSI) intervention in 2003, macroeconomic stability has been
maintained and activity has recovered. However, fundamental reforms remain essential to
raise the prospects of sustainable growth and reduce the economy’s vulnerability to shocks.
According to the authorities’ estimates, logging—accounting for two thirds of exports,
14 percent of tax revenue, and 10 percent of GDP—is expected to run out in about six years
at the current rate of cutting and must be replaced by new sources of private sector growth.
The task is complicated by political instability, rapid population growth, weak institutions
and governance, infrastructure deficiencies, high costs of doing business, limited
implementation capacity, entrenched vested interests, and poor social indicators (Figure 1
and Appendix VI).
2.
The government is aware of these challenges, and the discussions focused on how
to operationalize its Framework Document. The latter aims at “governance plus growth,”
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), rural advancement, effective service delivery,
as well as raising Solomon Islanders’ skills, which should help achieve all other goals.
Having taken office in May 2006, the new government at the time of the mission had not yet
articulated concrete policies through which these goals would be pursued. Hence, the
discussions dwelled on: (i) how to make the 2007–10 national development strategy a
country-led, implementable growth and poverty reduction strategy to achieve these
objectives and; (ii) fiscal issues, as these are the main source of risks to macroeconomic
stability, and structural fiscal reforms and state-owned enterprise (SOE) restructuring are
needed to establish a sound foundation for sustainable growth.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK
3.
Recent economic developments and
the near-term outlook are reasonably
positive, with growth above the regional
average. For the fourth year running, real
GDP growth is projected to exceed 5 percent
in 2006, with logging making no contribution
to growth (Table 1 and Figure 2).1 New
investments (mainly an oil palm plantation
and a gold mine) and some fiscal stimulus
will boost nontimber growth to 6 percent,
reflecting the start of palm oil production, and

The short-term economic impact of the April 2006 riots, following the general elections and prior to the
formation of the present government, was negligible as it affected mainly small retail businesses in Honiara.

a significant rise in services; nontimber output
growth is expected to remain at that level in
2007 (Table 2 and Figure 3). A projected
slowdown in total GDP growth to 4¼ percent in
2007 is due to lower logging. Owing to high oil
prices, expatriates’ demand, and rapid private
credit growth, inflation is in the high single
digits and above the regional average (Table 3
and Figure 4). With these pressures expected to
persist, inflation is unlikely to decline
substantially in the near term.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Medium-Term Outlook
5.
There was broad agreement that medium-term prospects depend on the vigor of
reforms (Tables 5–7). If progress on reforms is substantial, macroeconomic stability is
maintained, and RAMSI and donors remain fully engaged, real GDP growth could be
sustained at 5 percent (2 percent per capita) over the medium term, with nontimber
activities—primarily, agriculture and mining where new projects are emerging—more than
offsetting timber’s decline.
6.
Without reforms, living standards would fall and macroeconomic stability could
be compromised. ODA and FDI would decline substantially, and new nontimber activities
would not emerge. Growth could drop to under 2 percent, and per capita income would fall.
International reserves and government deposits could be all but exhausted as early as 2009,
when import compression and spending cuts would become inevitable and new arrears would
start accumulating.

7
7.
The baseline is an intermediate scenario. With financial stability and RAMSI and
donor engagement, but slow structural reforms, only limited new nontimber activities would
emerge and real GDP growth would converge to about 3 percent, barely matching population
growth. This represents a downgrading of the baseline compared to the 2005 Article IV
consultation, given greater uncertainty
concerning the government’s reform agenda.

started by the previous administration.
8.
The authorities considered that the baseline scenario could prove to be the most
realistic. They emphasized their commitment to macroeconomic stability, but also the
political sensitivities involved in implementing structural reforms. The government’s desire
to re-orient the development strategy towards rural areas and the search for local solutions
might require changing the policies started by the previous government and might slow
reforms, but could result in greater ownership and sustainability.
B. The 2007–10 Development Strategy and Aid Flows
9.
The authorities agreed that preparation of the 2007–10 national development
strategy offers an opportunity to translate the Framework Document’s goals into
concrete policies, but highlighted the challenges. The strategy—which is currently being
prepared to succeed the 2003–06 National Economic Recovery, Reform, and Development
Plan—should become the country’s poverty reduction strategy, drive the development
agenda, determine priorities, and be implementable and monitorable. This requires that it be
linked to operational plans and budgets. Such a country-led strategy, together with donor
commitments to align their assistance with it, would provide a sound basis for reform.
10.
The opportunity afforded by the large aid flows currently available should be
exploited by incorporating all programs and projects in the national strategy, and all
funding sources in the resource envelope. Donors have made substantial long-term
commitments to the country, estimated at about 25 percent of GDP since RAMSI’s
intervention, but they have also indicated that these flows will be reduced over time (Box 1).
Aid coordination is improving with lead donors identified in most areas and Sector-Wide
Approaches (SWAp) under way in some key sectors. Nevertheless, the framework provided
by the national development strategy would be better placed to harmonize donors’ different
approaches and overcome persisting difficulties in coordination between the government and
donors. The authorities maintained that greater capacity building efforts as part of donor

8

Box 1. Aid Flows
Donors support a wide range of projects in the Solomon Islands. The major bilateral donors are:
Australia; the European Union; Japan; New Zealand; and Taiwan Province of China.1 Australia and
New Zealand contribute directly and through RAMSI. Donors fund development spending almost
entirely, but also provide basic services (health, education, police, and law and order).
Aid flows rose sharply after RAMSI’s
intervention and are substantial by crosscountry comparisons. The staff estimates annual
aid disbursements in the order of 25 percent of
GDP (including technical assistance) in 2004–05,
equivalent to 94 percent of domestic revenue, ten
times the low income countries’ average, and the
largest among large PICs in per capita terms. At
present, only New Zealand’s assistance to
education is implemented through the
government’s budget. The remaining aid is
managed by individual donors and is not centrally
recorded. Australia has committed funds to
RAMSI until 2009, but information on other
donors’ multi-year commitments is not available.
The experience of Tanzania and Timor Leste
stand out as good examples in managing aid
flows.

assistance hold the key to reducing aid dependency over time. The staff commended the
authorities’ recent efforts toward the adoption of a system that tracks aid delivery and
donors’ multiyear projections of realistic aid disbursements, as the absence of such a system
risks duplication and hampers the assessment of future fiscal pressures, as donors withdraw
from projects/programs.
C. Fiscal Policy and Debt
11.
The 2006 fiscal outturn is likely to be better than budgeted, but expenditure
quality could be improved. The budget envisages a shift to a deficit of ¾ percent of GDP
from a 2¼ percent surplus in 2005, due to a 21 percent real increase in goods and services
purchases and domestically-financed development spending. In the staff’s view, the budget
outturn is likely to be about 1 percentage point of GDP better than budgeted, with higher
spending in low-priority areas (wage bill, tertiary scholarships, and representation) likely to
be more than offset by revenue overperformance (due to improved tax compliance and a
reduction in logging duty exemptions) and investment underspending. Given that
deficiencies in project planning and execution capacity are constraining much needed
investment outlays, the government should refrain from spending unused funds. It should
also save the revenue overperformance. This fiscal stance would also help contain inflation.
12.
The authorities are committed to remain within budget, but argued for the need
to increase wages and fill vacancies across the civil service. Following a 3 percent increase
at the beginning of the year, civil service wages were raised by 6 percent in July,
retroactively to January, with much larger increases for departmental heads. The authorities
maintained that the degree of budget overperformance will be dictated by the speed of
implementation of the new government’s policies, which is likely to be slow. The process of
filling vacancies is accelerating, but it is still expected that about half of them will remain
unfilled by year-end. In these circumstances, the authorities considered that a small budget
surplus would be achieved despite these wage increases.
13.
The authorities shared staff’s concerns about looming medium-term fiscal
pressures, and intend to continue their efforts towards developing a medium-term fiscal
strategy. Albeit difficult to estimate in terms of size and timing, pressures will arise from:
(i) declining tax receipts from logging while large agricultural and mining projects just
starting have been granted tax holidays/exemptions; (ii) lower import duties because of the
Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement; (iii) lower aid flows; (iv) demands for higher
wages and public employment; and (v) social, infrastructure, and operation and maintenance
needs. SOEs’ and provincial governments’ poor financial situation and fiscal decentralization
may also contribute. Building on the forward estimates presented for the first time in the
2006 budget, the authorities will continue to work towards a medium-term fiscal framework
that takes into account these pressures.

10
14.
The medium-term budget envelope is constrained by the availability of
financing, and the desire to avoid abrupt fiscal retrenchment and to reduce the high
public debt. The debt service requirement and the fact that government deposits are the only
source of financing over the next few years (reflecting the government policy of no projected
new borrowing in light of the already high debt level and poor credit history) require an
overall budget surplus. Assuming that government deposits are used over five years and that
aid flows remain directly managed by donors, the budget surplus would need to be about
1 percent of GDP per year over the medium term (a ½ percentage point of GDP adjustment
compared to the projected 2006 outturn).
Declining revenue from logging and import

investment. This could be achieved by
strictly limiting the wage bill, which is
equivalent to 10 percent of GDP and about 40 percent of current spending. There is also
scope to reduce outlays on representation, administration and tertiary scholarships, as
suggested by recent audits.
15.
The new government is committed to tax reform, but capacity constraints will
likely dictate a staged approach. Implementing the tax reform outlined in the outgoing
government’s Discussion Paper (November 2005), which has VAT as the linchpin, would
relieve two major shortcomings of the present tax system: a narrow base and cascading.
Exemptions are estimated to reduce the tax take by over a third and cascading inflates the
effective import tax to over 40 percent. While proceeding to work toward this comprehensive
reform, the authorities emphasized that it will require extensive legislative and administrative
changes. The authorities explained that incremental changes—such as the recent issuance of
rules-based and transparent tax exemptions guidelines—would proceed in parallel with the
redesign of the system. The staff welcomed these guidelines and the announced revocation of
logging duty exemptions, and encouraged the government to refrain from granting any new
tax preferences. Also, bringing the reference prices of timber and fish in line with market
prices is another step that could be taken immediately.

Improvements in the composition of public spending are highly desirable. Some
fiscal space for investment and recurrent costs of donor-funded projects would be created by
the current spending cuts proposed by staff. A comprehensive civil service reform that

compared with 30 percent to primary
(80 percent of students).
17.
While appreciating the benefits of reorienting spending, the authorities saw a
greater need to introduce government subsidies that could promote rural development.
The Framework Document mentions subsidies to several sectors and in particular to
businesses in rural areas. Staff argued that granting non-targeted subsidies can be costly,
whereas implementing the International Finance Corporation Foreign Advisory Service’s
recommendations on investment incentives would be more effective.
18.
Noting greater compliance with public finance laws/procedures, the authorities
agreed that room for improvement in PFM remains considerable. Local purchase orders
are now required for procurement. The ongoing revitalization of the Solomon Islands
Accounting Services is enhancing PFM capacity across ministries. Nevertheless,
underspending and routine supplementary budgets reflect poor budget planning and

12
execution. Recent payroll and tertiary education audits have uncovered irregularities and
tender processes need strengthening. The authorities commented that the staff’s suggestion to
replace the unfunded contingency warrants with a smaller fully-funded contingency reserve
would be useful, but politically unpalatable, and that the planned simplification in budget
classification should reduce supplementary appropriations.3 Follow-up on the recent audits
and modifications to the Finance Instructions along PFTAC’s recommendations should also
raise expenditure efficiency and governance.
19.
The authorities agreed that SOEs’ poor performance should be urgently
addressed. Although data are scant, risks from SOEs appear substantial and their service
delivery poor. The recent financial review of the Solomon Islands Electricity Authority
(SIEA), the largest SOE, concluded that it is close to insolvency with accumulated losses of
about 10 percent of GDP and debt 15 times its net worth. SIEA suffers from a negative cash
flow (partly due to an arrears buildup by the Solomon Islands Water Authority, SIWA)
requiring frequent cash injections from the Treasury (estimated at ¼ percent of GDP for
2006) and, the company has recently borrowed commercially. The World Bank’s proposed
management contract to run SIEA and SIWA jointly should be implemented urgently.
Audited accounts of all SOEs should be compiled. The authorities concurred that SOEs
should be reformed, but remarked that this would take time, partly because they are currently
autonomous statutory bodies and SOEs' accounts have not been audited in years.
20.
While the government believes that power should shift to rural areas, it offered
reassurances that it would proceed cautiously with fiscal decentralization. Greater
involvement of the provinces and communities in policy formulation and implementation is
welcome, but fiscal decentralization could be costly and ineffective, especially until public
finances and capacity strengthen. The devolution of revenue and spending responsibilities
also requires good information on local governments’ operations, which is currently
unavailable. The government is currently focused on improving provincial governments’
administrative capacity and efforts are under way to ascertain the debts owed by provincial
governments and compile their financial accounts.
21.
The authorities agreed that despite progress, public debt remains at high risk of
distress and continued efforts to regularize it are needed (Appendix I).4 The Honiara Club
initiative led to a short-term moratorium by one creditor and the possibility of debt
forgiveness after the planned 2007 review.5 After successful negotiations with commercial

creditors and the CBSI and payment of informal arrears, total government debt declined to
80 percent of GDP in 2005, and the NPV of external debt fell to 40 percent of GDP. All debt
indicators improve in the baseline scenario with the continuation of the government’s policy
of no new borrowing. Nevertheless, debt could rise rapidly with lower export and GDP
growth. Lower GDP growth and a return of

with the Honiara Club agreement. The
government’s policy not to contract new
loans remains necessary at present, while once debt is regularized and has been substantially
reduced, modest amounts of domestic borrowing would be appropriate.
D. Exchange Rate and Monetary Management
22.
The staff supported the current, pragmatic exchange rate policy. In the face of
strong ODA and other inflows, the CBSI has stabilized the value of the Solomon Islands
dollar versus the U.S. dollar. The de facto peg has served as nominal anchor and has
contributed to a rise in the reserve position to the equivalent of 5½ months of imports
(Table 8). As projects financed by these inflows are implemented, reserves will decline,
which should be allowed. If downward pressure on the exchange rate were to materialize
from other sources, the exchange rate should adjust, since the country cannot appropriately
defend a peg and is vulnerable to frequent external shocks. However, domestic policy
slippages should be addressed by tightening fiscal and monetary policy rather than by greater
exchange rate flexibility.
23.
The current level of
competitiveness appears broadly
adequate. The available indicators are
relatively comforting. Provided investors’
confidences are maintained, with new
projects starting, prospects for nontimber
exports are fairly positive suggesting
profitability in the export sector is
satisfactory. The CPI-based REER remains
17 percent below its 1997–2001 average, and

private sector wages appear to be below regional comparators. However, the risk of Dutch
disease associated with aid efforts—some pressures on housing and skilled labor have started
appearing—and the deterioration in the terms of trade in recent years calls for close
monitoring and underscores the need for structural reforms.
24.
As inflation pressures are likely to persist, the CBSI intends to focus on
improving its inflation monitoring tool kit. With rising oil prices, high private credit
growth, and a limited supply response of the economy to increased demand for services,
inflation pressures are unlikely to ease substantially in the near term. The staff argued that if
demand pressures or second-round effects of higher oil prices are likely to intensify—which
does not presently appear to be the case—or if reserves came under pressure, the CBSI
should reassess the domestic credit expansion and take measures, including raising the liquid
asset ratio (LAR) and introducing (possibly tradable) credit ceilings.6 The CBSI agreed with
this strategy and added that once the national CPI becomes available, inflation sources should
become clearer and technical assistance on inflation forecasting would be helpful. This
would allow the CBSI to adopt a more forward-looking approach to conducting monetary
policy. Over time the CBSI plans to expand its instruments by developing the Treasury bill
market, but in the short run, issuing more Treasury bills is likely to be hindered by the
government’s poor credit history.
E. Financial Sector Issues
25.
The CBSI concurred that the financial system should be strengthened by
completing the liquidation of the Development Bank of Solomon Islands (DBSI) and
raising the National Provident Fund’s (NPF) profitability. Pressures to revive the
troubled DBSI should be resisted. All depositors are likely to be repaid by year-end when the
CBSI court-appointed management mandate ends. The bank’s negative net worth is
estimated at ½ percent of GDP, but, if liquidated, its largest creditor indicated its willingness
to write off its loans. The CBSI has agreed in principle to let the NPF invest abroad to boost
its profitability, but simple and very conservative investment guidelines (currently under
preparation) and clear monitoring procedures must be applied. The NPF should also improve
asset quality and contain costs. Approval of the draft NPF bill would strengthen the
institution’s governance.
26.
The authorities are focusing on broadening access to banking services and
credit. Recent and planned initiatives—such as a mobile bank, and an ANZ-post office
partnership—underscore how private-public partnerships can help extend banking services
on a commercial basis. Enhancing the secured lending transaction framework could also
increase access to credit and bank competition. These initiatives have the advantage of being
commercially oriented and hence do not weaken commercial banks, which are currently
6

15
adequately capitalized, highly liquid, and profitable. The CBSI viewed these initiatives as a
key catalyst for the DBSI’s liquidation.
F. Growth-Enhancing Structural Reforms
27.
The government recognizes that its role is to establish the conditions under
which the private sector can be the economy’s engine of growth and the vital role that
structural reforms play in this (Table 9). Improving governance (including in taxation,
PFM, SOEs, and the NPF) is key in attracting investment and using public money and aid
more effectively. Upgrading service delivery and the financial position of SOEs is necessary
for businesses and for higher social well-being. Better transportation and lower
telecommunication costs would improve the business environment, by facilitating access to
markets and stimulating new growth areas, such as tourism. Reforms to cut red tape and
update commercial laws would also contribute to enhancing the business environment.
28.
The authorities remarked that reforms that support rural development will take
center-stage. Only in this way can economic development benefit the majority of the
population: also given that the poor are concentrated in rural areas, this approach should
achieve the greatest impact on poverty alleviation. The initiatives mentioned above will
contribute to rural advancement, but an agricultural and rural development strategy is also
being developed with donors’ and World Bank’s assistance. The authorities added that land
reform is essential and in principle so is better management of forests, but the fact that the
majority of the land is under customary ownership limits the government’s impact in these
areas.
29.
The authorities agreed that, over the next year, tangible progress in key
structural reforms would be necessary to signal their reform commitment and boost
confidence. The new government’s gazetting of the new foreign investment bill in June
provided a positive, first signal. Implementing the SIEA/SIWA management contract would
be a further critical step. Progress in streamlining immigration and labor permits would also
send positive signals. The government is also considering ways to reduce import duties and
other measures to liberalize the trade regime.
G. Statistics
30.
Measures are under way to remedy serious deficiencies in the statistical
database. National accounts, fiscal, and external data are weak (Appendix VII). The
Statistics Office is completing a Household Income and Expenditure Survey to produce
poverty and MDGs indicators and on which national accounts and a national consumer price
index will be based. Surveys to improve external sector data are planned for 2006–07.

16
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
The economic recovery and stability prevailing since RAMSI’s intervention will
likely persist in the near term, but raising living standards on a sustainable basis remains a
formidable challenge. Growth has remained robust and two large projects have started. Budget
discipline has been maintained and inflation is under control. However, with the natural forest
expected to run out in some six years, diversifying the economy is imperative. This requires
jump-starting structural reforms.
32.
The 2007–10 national development strategy should become the key mechanism for
policy formulation and aid coordination. The strategy currently under preparation should be
the umbrella framework for all projects and programs, including those run by donors. Setting up
a system that tracks aid delivery is a vital first step. Backing the strategy with a sound mediumterm macroeconomic framework and linking it to the budget would ensure its realism and that it
can be implemented. An evaluation framework will also be needed to monitor progress and
strengthen accountability.
33.
With pressures looming, the government should set fiscal policy with a mediumterm perspective. Given limited financing sources and the need to reduce the high public debt,
consolidation is required. Declining revenue from logging and import duties need to be replaced
with domestic taxes and current spending as a share of GDP reduced by containing the wage bill.
The government’s commitment to budget discipline is welcome, as is its intention to continue
developing a medium-term fiscal framework. In the short run, it should refrain from spending
unutilized appropriations for investment projects and revenue overperformance.
34.
Fiscal reforms are critical to support fiscal consolidation and growth. Reorienting
spending from the high wage bill towards investment, especially infrastructure, and
implementing a tax reform that widens the base while reducing rates and cascading should be
key elements of the fiscal reform agenda. Public financial management reforms would help
ensure better governance and allow aid flows to be brought within budget. SOEs’ poor
performance requires urgent attention. Fiscal decentralization should be approached very
carefully and should not involve a weakening of fiscal discipline.
35.
Despite progress, the risk of debt distress remains high. Public debt is high, and
shocks, even temporary ones, could cause it to rise significantly. Contingent liabilities are likely
to increase due to the weak finances of SOEs and provincial governments. Moreover, efforts to
regularize the debt situation should be sustained, and the policy of no new borrowing enforced
for all public entities, including SOEs, until the debt situation improves substantially.
36.
The exchange rate policy is appropriate, and competitiveness appears adequate, but
the CBSI should remain vigilant on inflation. The current stabilization of the S.I. dollar versus
the U.S. dollar shields the economy from the effects of strong foreign inflows, but downward
pressure on the exchange rate should not be resisted. Good prospects for nontimber exports
suggest that competitiveness is reasonable. Efforts under way to upgrade the central bank’s

17
inflation forecasting ability are important to ensure a timely monetary policy response, if
inflation pressures intensify or if reserves were to come under pressure.
37.
Liquidating the DBSI, strengthening the NPF’s profitability, and widening access to
banking without compromising financial stability are key financial reforms. The process of
winding up the troubled DBSI is advanced and should be completed. Commercially-based
mechanisms should be used to broaden access to banking services and credit to ensure their
viability. Allowing the NPF to invest abroad could boost the institution’s profitability, but simple
and conservative investment guidelines for the Fund need to be developed, and it has to be
strictly supervised by the CBSI. The new NPF bill would also improve the institution’s
governance.
38.
Among structural reforms, priority should be accorded to better governance, SOE
restructuring, and improving transportation infrastructure. The business environment, as
well as rural development, will benefit from these reforms. The gazetting of the new foreign
investment bill is commendable, but further strong signals of the government’s reform
orientation are needed to bolster confidence, with the most critical being the restructuring of the
utilities.
39.
Improving the statistical database is essential to better ground policymaking and
monitor results. At present, the statistical database is barely adequate for surveillance. Measures
under way should improve real and external sector data, but upgrading statistics will be a longterm process.
40.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be conducted on the 12-month
cycle.

APPENDIX I: SOLOMON ISLANDS—MEDIUM-TERM BASELINE SCENARIO
AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS1
The staff’s medium-term baseline scenario would achieve only small increases in living
standards, and leave the Solomon Islands at high risk of debt distress. Assuming
macroeconomic stability and continued donor involvement, but only limited progress in
structural reforms, this baseline downgrades macro forecasts, especially growth, compared to
the 2005 Article IV due to greater uncertainty regarding the government’s reform agenda.
Although the debt situation has improved compared to last year, historical scenarios and several
stress tests—even some temporary ones—still lead to a significant rise in the debt burden.
Medium-term Scenario
Under the medium-term baseline scenario, real GDP growth is projected to converge to
about 3 percent, only slightly above population growth. This scenario assumes that the
two large projects that have recently started (palm oil production and the rehabilitation of a
gold mine) will continue, but not many new nontimber activities would commence. Inflation
eases but remains around 7 percent. The real effective exchange rate is assumed to be
constant. Export growth falls to about 1.0 percent given limited new activities to replace
logging which is expected to wind down to about half of its current harvest rate by 2011.2
The current account deficit gradually improves as import growth declines given lower
official development assistance (ODA) and investment inflows, but stays at about 9 percent
of GDP. The reserve coverage falls as ODA and exports ease, but remains adequate at above
4 months of imports. The budget position would need to maintain a small surplus due to
financing constraints and the desire to avoid abrupt fiscal retrenchment, and to reduce the
high public debt. Risks to the baseline appear roughly balanced. The country’s history of
political instability and volatile growth and export performance pose downside risks. On the
other hand, the government may build upon the reforms started by the previous
administration which could boost nontimber private sector activity and growth.
Debt
Some progress has been achieved in regularizing the debt situation. The Honiara Club
initiative led to a short-term moratorium on principal payments and the forgiveness of interest
payments during the moratorium (0.2 percent of GDP) from one creditor, as well as the

1

Prepared jointly with World Bank staff.

The current logging rate is about four times the sustainable rate.

35
possibility of debt forgiveness and arrears settlement after a planned review in 2007.3 The
review will focus on the government’s commitments to continue to regularize its debts,
maintain fiscal discipline, refrain from contracting new loans, and advance on structural
reforms. Given uncertainties on the content of the final agreement under the Honiara Club, this
analysis does not assume debt forgiveness, but incorporates the impact of the short-term
moratorium and related interest forgiveness. Successful negotiations with external commercial
creditors achieved debt relief amounting to 2½ percent of GDP. The stock of informal arrears
also fell by about 2 percent of GDP to 4½ percent of GDP.4
These developments helped reduce total public debt to 80 percent of GDP in 2005—lower
than the starting point at the time of the 2005 Article IV consultation of 92 percent of GDP in
2004—despite the calling of a government guarantee on a loan to the state fishing company. In
February 2006, agreement was also reached with the Central Bank of the Solomon Islands
(CBSI) on outstanding advances and interest arrears.5
Debt Sustainability in the Baseline Scenario6
Results of the baseline external debt sustainability analysis are mixed (Appendix I,
Table I.1).7 At end-2005, the NPV of external debt to GDP at 40 percent was higher than its
Board-endorsed threshold, but is expected to fall below it by 2009.8 All other indicators,
including the ratios of the NPV of debt to exports and revenue, and debt service ratios were
below their thresholds, and are expected to decline over time. This assumes that the
government’s current policy of incurring no new debt will continue.
3

The Honiara Club is a multilateral forum convened by the government in October 2005 to seek debt relief
from its official creditors. Four creditors participated in the Honiara Club, namely, the Export Finance and
Insurance Corporation (EFIC), the European Commission, the European Investment Bank, and the International
Fund for Agricultural Development.
4

Informal arrears are arrears to suppliers.

5

In February 2006, 25 percent of interest arrears to the CBSI amounting to 0.4 percent of GDP was settled, the
rest was forgiven, and outstanding advances were converted into long-term bonds carrying a 2¼ percent interest
rate.
6

Data on private external, state enterprise, and provincial government debt are not available. Therefore, the
analysis is limited to central government debt data.
7

This analysis assumes that the government remains current on all obligations from June 2006, and that all
debts in arrears are treated as a current short-term obligation with NPV equal to its face value. Existing external
arrears are assumed to continue growing with accrued interest.
8

The thresholds (see Appendix I, Table I.1) apply to countries with weak policies and institutions, and are
discussed in Operational Framework for Debt Sustainability Analysis in Low Income Countries—Further
Considerations. The Solomon Islands’ CPIA at 2.8 is the lowest among the Pacific Island Countries.

36
Albeit declining, the overall central government debt remains high (Appendix I,
Table I.2). At end-2005, public domestic debt including arrears stood at 26 percent of GDP,
about half its peak of 51 percent in 2003. In 2006, domestic debt is expected to decline
further to 20 percent of GDP, partly reflecting the settlement of the bulk of remaining
informal arrears. Nevertheless, total public debt would still be 42 percent of GDP in 2011,
and the NPV of public sector debt to revenue ratio stays above 100 percent until 2012.
Risks to the debt dynamics
Historical scenarios and even some temporary stress tests demonstrate the country’s
vulnerable debt position (Appendix I, Tables I.3–I.4).
•

External Debt: Key variables at their historical averages set the NPV of external debt
to exports on a rising path. Even a temporary export growth decline increases the
NPV of debt to exports to over twice its threshold. If all recognized contingent
liabilities are realized (13.5 percent of GDP), the NPV of external debt to GDP would
exceed 30 percent of GDP until 2015.

•

Public Debt: Lower GDP growth, even temporarily, and a return of growth and the
primary balance to their historical averages causes the NPV of public debt to GDP
and revenue ratios to rise dramatically.

These tests seem especially relevant given the country’s volatile economic and political
history, poor credit history, and uncertainties surrounding the government’s reform
orientation.
These results are indicative given major uncertainties surrounding important variables.
Macroeconomic variables (especially GDP) are subject to large measurement errors. ODA
plans are uncertain and contingent liabilities are likely to increase as audits of SOEs and
provincial governments are under way for the first time in many years.

Board Endorsed
2026 Threshold 6/

1/ Refers to central government debt only due to data availability. This table assumes the government's current policy of not incurring new debt. The DSA exercise was conducted jointly with the World Bank.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price
and exchange rate changes.
4/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
5/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
6/ These thresholds apply to countries with weak policies and institutions and are discussed in Operational Framework for Debt Sustainability Analysis in Low-Income Countries--Further Considerations .

Sources: Data provided by the authorities; and Fund staff estimates.

Estimate

Sources: Data provided by the authorities; and Fund staff estimates.
1/ The DSA exercise was conducted jointly with the World Bank.
2/ Gross central government debt, including informal arrears. Foreign currency denominated debt converted using end-of-period exchange rate.
3/ Current estimate of recognized contingent liabilities. Remaining contingent liabilities are estimated at 10 percent of GDP.
4/ Gross financing need is defined as the primary deficit plus debt service plus the stock of short-term debt at the end of the last period.
5/ Revenues excluding grants.
6/ Debt service is defined as the sum of interest and amortization of medium and long-term debt.
7/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

3/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline, while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
4/ Liabilities realized and add to arrears from the beginning of 2007, attracting an interest rate equal to 2007 six month libor.
5/ Ratios calculated using baseline export-to-GDP, since GDP and exports are driven by the same primary commodities.
6/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
7/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
8/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
9/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Exchange Rate Arrangements:
Since November 2000, the exchange rate for the Solomon Islands (S.I.) dollar has
been based on an undisclosed trade-weighted basket of the currencies of the Solomon
Islands’ major trading partners, with the U.S. dollar as the intervention currency.
During 2002, as pressures on external reserves intensified, the Central Bank of
Solomon Islands (CBSI) accelerated the rate of currency depreciation, leading to a
gradual real depreciation of the S.I. dollar. Since December 2002, the CBSI has kept
the exchange rate broadly stable against the U.S. dollar, although there is no public
commitment to continue to do so. The Solomon Islands now maintains an exchange
system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions.

APPENDIX III: SOLOMON ISLANDS—SUPPORT FROM THE PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL
ASSISTANCE CENTER1
(As of July 2006)
Tax Administration and Policy
A mission in May 2004 designed plans to modernize and enhance the efficiency of the
Customs and Tax Divisions. A further mission in May 2005 reviewed the current system,
outlined a detailed strategy for the implementation of tax reforms over the next few years,
and assessed the required technical assistance to support this strategy. The authorities have
released a tax reform proposal in conformity with PFTAC’s advice. A mission in January
2006 assisted the government with detailed implementation of the reform proposal, including
the preparation of draft legislation. It is anticipated that PFTAC and LEG will assist further
in this area and a request for assistance is expected shortly.
Public Financial Management
In May 2006, the PFTAC adviser undertook a review of the Public Finance and Audit Act
(1978), the Finance Instructions (1978) and the Stores Instructions (1976) (SIs). The mission
agreed with the authorities that the more immediate need was for a process redesign of the
key accounting operations, linked to a significant redraft of the Finance Instructions. PFTAC
would oversee the provision of two peripatetic experts to undertake this project, tentatively
scheduled for August/September 2006.
Financial Sector Regulation and Supervision
In September 2004, an advisor visited the CBSI to advise on the implementation of an antimoney laundering regime. In September 2005, a PFTAC advisor assisted CBSI staff in
conducting an AML/CFT on-site examination of a domestic bank. In October 2005, LEG
provided technical assistance to the authorities on the establishment of a financial
intelligence unit (FIU) and on the strengthening of the anti-money laundering and combating
of terrorist financing (AML/CFT) legislation. In February 2006, the advisor participated in
an AML/CFT awareness training seminar conducted by the CBSI. A peripatetic advisor
visited in January 2005 to assist with streamlining the financial reporting system; and experts
visited in February and May 2005 to review the supervision and regulation of the insurance
industry. In April 2005, a PFTAC advisor worked with an MFD expert to provide assistance

The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) in Suva, Fiji, is a regional technical assistance
institution operated by the IMF with financial support of the Asian Development Bank, Australia, Japan, Korea
and New Zealand. The Center’s aim is to build skills and institutional capacity for effective economic and
financial management that can be sustained at the national level. Member countries are: Cook Islands,
Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa,
Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.

on the supervision of an insurance company; provided advice on the oversight of the
Solomon Islands National Provident Fund, developed supervisory guidelines on AML/CFT
activities in financial institutions, and prepared a project document for the establishment of
the FIU. CBSI staff also attended a seminar on monetary policy in shallow markets arranged
by PFTAC/MFD in March 2005. In February 2006, a PFTAC advisor participated in an
AML awareness raising seminar.
Economic and Financial Statistics
During 2003, the National Statistics Office (NSO) restarted activity, with the production of
the Honiara CPI. A PFTAC mission in February 2004 devised a recovery plan, and AusAID
and NZAID have committed to provide funding. The CBSI currently compiles balance of
payments and national accounts data and CBSI staff attended a regional training course on
balance of payments statistics arranged by PFTAC in April 2005. Missions in August 2005
and February 2006 reviewed current methodologies for balance of payments and national
accounts statistics and suggested some short-term improvements to their compilation.
Assistance has also been provided on a prototype government finance statistics system. The
NSO is currently undertaking a Household Income and Expenditure Survey, with assistance
from the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, and business surveys.

APPENDIX IV: SOLOMON ISLANDS—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of July 2006)
Since becoming a Bank member in June 1978, the Solomon Islands has received eight IDA
credits totaling US$50 million in the infrastructure, education, health, finance, and
agriculture sectors. Following the repayment of all outstanding arrears in September 2003,
the Solomon Islands came out of non-accrual status, and country relations have normalized.
The Solomon Islands is eligible for an IDA 14 allocation of SDR 6.8 million (indicative
only) over FY 2006–08. The IDA allocation for FY06 is SDR 1.9 million and this is on a
grant-financed basis.
The Bank’s assistance to the Solomon Islands is motivated by the need for re-engagement in
a low capacity post-conflict country, while recognizing the abundance of donor funds. The
assistance program is guided by the government’s own development priorities articulated in
the National Economic Reform, Recovery, and Development Plan (2003–06), and the Bank’s
broader Pacific Regional Strategy which has a focus on (1) strengthening government
capabilities, and (2) improving incentives for the private sector. The Bank’s involvement in
the Solomon Islands is in the following areas:
•

National Planning. The Bank is assisting the Department of National Planning and Aid
Coordination in identifying economic priorities to feed into the successor of the current
National Economic Reform, Recovery, and Development Plan.

•

Health Sector. The IDA-funded (US$4.0 million) Health Sector Development Project
approved in mid-2000 is helping address some of the challenges in the sector through the
strengthening of the reproductive health and malaria programs, the testing of new
approaches, and through improved planning, management and monitoring. The Bank is
now working on the development of a broader health sector support program together
with AusAID, expected to involve joint IDA and AusAID financing.

•

Education Sector. The government has launched a new education strategy and is
developing a sector-wide approach to education planning and financing with support
from NZAid and the EU. The Bank is providing selected policy inputs into this process,
drawing on the lessons of such approaches elsewhere.

•

Energy Supply. The Bank is supporting government’s efforts to improve the efficiency
of the energy sector by providing technical assistance for the financial restructuring of the
Solomon Islands Electricity Authority (SIEA), regulatory reform and capacity building,
as well as to explore options to improve rural access and service delivery in remote areas.
Given the linkages, this work is also addressing the water utility (Solomon Islands Water
Authority). Subject to progress on the planned reforms, use of IDA funds may be used to

49
catalyze investment in the energy sector (e.g., PPP options). The Bank has also included
the Solomon Islands in a regional renewable energy project.
•

Rural Growth. The Bank is working with the EC and AusAID to prepare a rural sector
strategy to diversify and increase rural income-generating opportunities as the basis for
stronger and more inclusive growth. A follow-up IDA operation is envisaged, in
cooperation with other donors active in the sector.

•

Telecommunications Sector. The Bank is providing technical assistance to the
government to examine ways to improve the competitiveness of the sector to reduce
telecommunication costs and improve the service quality and coverage.

•

Foreign and Domestic Investment. The Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS)
has provided assistance to the government for the preparation of new foreign investment
legislation and is assisting with a review of investment incentives and administrative
barriers to business.

APPENDIX V: SOLOMON ISLANDS—RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of July 2006)
Since joining AsDB in 1973, Solomon Islands has received 16 loans for a total amount of
US$79.3 million, and 58 technical assistance (TA) projects for a total amount of US$13.6 million.
The last AsDB loan was approved in 2000 to rehabilitate critical basic infrastructure damaged by the
civil strife. This loan, along with other country operations, was temporarily suspended between
February 2002 and September 2003, due to security concerns and debt servicing arrears. Country
relations have normalized since. However, in agreement with the government, the AsDB will provide
no new loans to the country until public finances have stabilized. Current assistance is provided
entirely on grant basis. The Solomon Islands is eligible for Asian Development Fund (ADF) grants
introduced to effectively promote development in countries that are very poor, heavily indebted, or in
a post-conflict situation. The 2005–2006 ADF allocation for the Solomon Islands succeeded in
catalyzing substantial bilateral grant cofinancing for the improvement of rural roads.
AsDB’s ongoing country strategy—guided by the government's National Economic Recovery,
Reform, and Development Plan, and AsDB’s Pacific Strategy 2005–2009—seeks to achieve rapid,
pro-poor, private sector-led economic growth, and focuses on improving transportation infrastructure
and services and enabling business environment. Capacity development and the promotion of good
governance are cross-cutting priorities. AsDB currently has five ongoing TA projects in the areas of
institutional strengthening of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Development, inter-island
transportation, state-owned enterprise reform and private sector participation, and business law
reform. TA for secured transactions reform is being prepared. In early 2006, the scope of the AsDB’s
ongoing Post-Conflict Emergency Rehabilitation Project (PCERP) was significantly expanded, with
support of Australia and New Zealand. The Country Strategy and Program Update (CSPU
2005-2006) can be found at www.adb.org/Documents/CSPs/SOL/2004/default.asp, and a new CSPU
2007–2009 is being prepared.
AsDB’s Pacific Liaison and Coordination Office, established in 2005 in Sydney, is responsible for
country programming, project implementation and administration, supported by the Pacific
Operations Division in Manila.

APPENDIX VI: SOLOMON ISLANDS—POVERTY AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDICATORS
Social indicators of poverty and human development remain low in the Solomon Islands. The
country ranks 128 out of 177 countries in the United Nations Human Development Index,
below all Pacific island countries, except Papua New Guinea. There are few recent poverty
statistics, but anecdotal evidence suggests poverty remains high. However, the more extreme
forms of poverty, such as malnourishment, have remained limited due to an abundant
resource base, assured access to customary land tenure, and resilient social networks. This
advantage is under pressure from a population growth rate that, at about 3.0 percent a year, is
among the highest in the world.
Nonetheless, the Solomon Islands has achieved some progress in improving living conditions
since independence despite falling per capita incomes. Prior to the civil conflict in 1999,
sizable health and education expenditures (at 3–5 percent of GDP each) and high per capita
aid inflows had helped underpin these improvements. Providing widespread and quality
education to the very young population (45 percent under age 15) is a challenge. The primary
education enrollment ratio is about 95 percent, although primary education is not
compulsory. The enrollment ratio is only 30 percent in secondary education. Concerning
health, malaria is rampant, with the highest rate of infection in the world outside of subSaharan Africa, and a third of the rural population lacks access to safe water.
The paucity of data makes an assessment of human development trends since 1999 difficult,
but anecdotal evidence suggests that pro-poor services delivery is improving. The positive
trend was likely either halted or reversed during the civil conflict. While the conflict sharply
reduced agricultural production for market (due to the lack of security and transport
services), this has recovered since mid-2003 and service delivery has been enhanced.
The aggregate social indicators mask large differences between urban and rural areas. The
two main problems in the rural sector are the lack of essential public services such as health
and education, and cash income due to difficulties in market access for rural products. While
the urban areas have better social services and average incomes are higher, the urban poor
face difficulties in securing employment and land for residence.
The government plans to incorporate the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in its
forthcoming National Development Strategy, and has committed to monitor progress towards
them. Achieving the MDGs by 2015 is still possible, but remains a major challenge. Progress
in some areas, such as reducing malaria incidence, maternal mortality, and ensuring
environmental sustainability, has so far been inadequate.

APPENDIX VII: SOLOMON ISLANDS—STATISTICAL ISSUES
The economic and financial database is poor, which significantly limits the staff’s analysis,
particularly for the real, fiscal, and external sectors. Only the monetary statistics are adequate
for surveillance purposes. Although the rebuilding of the National Statistics Office (NSO)
has commenced, the CBSI continues to publish highly summarized monetary and price data
in its Monthly Economic Bulletin and data on all sectors in its Quarterly Review and Annual
Report. There is a Solomon Islands page in IFS, but significant updating delays occur,
particularly for the balance of payments (BOP), government finance, and national accounts
statistics.
Real sector statistics
As the NSO has not produced national accounts data since 1994, the task of preparing GDP
estimates was taken over by the CBSI. GDP estimates are severely hampered by data
availability and quality, and rely on limited sources (primarily commodity exports and
employment estimates). No breakdown of GDP by expenditure categories exists. A February
2006 PFTAC mission reviewed the 2005 GDP estimates and 2006 projections and concluded
that unless the shortage of source data for GDP estimates is addressed, the quality of
estimates would remain poor. The NSO reclaimed the task of producing the CPI (which
currently applies only to Honiara) in August 2003, but the weights are outdated. Data on
production of major export commodities are reported monthly. Limited data on total
employment can be obtained from the National Provident Fund. Wage data are not produced.
Monetary and financial statistics
The CBSI publishes monthly monetary statistics in summary form and provides more
detailed data in its quarterly and annual reports. The monetary and financial statistics from
the CBSI are used to update the IFS country page. After some disruption during the civil
conflict, the CBSI recently resumed direct reporting to STA. A November 2005 expert
mission, during a PFTAC monetary statistics workshop held in Fiji, reviewed the monetary
statistics compilation procedures and provided training and a work plan for the CBSI to
comply with the methodology of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual and to report
data using the standardized report forms (SRFs), introduced in October 2004.
Government finance statistics
The Ministry of Finance (MOF) started monthly press releases on budget outturns in August
2003. However, its expenditure and financing data are not consistent with the GFS
methodology, and historical data seem unreliable given the breakdown of accounting
mechanisms and large expenditure arrears during the crisis. The NSO is developing a
prototype GFS system, but problems exist in the coverage of the general government sector.
In particular, data for provincial governments are unavailable and data for the state
enterprises are currently being compiled. Except for direct budget support, the authorities do

55
not collect disbursements information on grants or grant-financed development spending.
The Ministry of Planning held meetings with donors in March and June 2006 to discuss the
need for better information and have recently designed reporting forms to obtain data from
donors. The installation of the Commonwealth Secretariat Debt Recording and Management
System (CS-DRMS) database in the CBSI and MOF in March 2005 has improved the quality
of official debt data. The MOF does not report annual GFS data for the Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook (GFSY).
External sector statistics
The CBSI estimates partial quarterly BOP data based on cash foreign exchange transactions
(FET) reported through the banking system, which are available with a three-month lag. Such
data are deficient in detail and coverage. A February 2006 PFTAC mission noted a
significant deterioration in the net errors and omission item. In addition, “other items” in
several categories have increased significantly, indicating a deterioration of data quality.
Surveys of enterprises on service and financial flows are conducted to collect supplementary
information, but the response rates are very low. The Customs Department has recently
started to publish merchandise trade data but initial analysis shows that there are still missing
records. A mission from New Zealand in February 2006 began to install PCTrade software in
the Customs Department to facilitate the NSO’s use of Customs data to prepare trade
statistics.
Remedial Measures
The NSO is gradually resuming data collection and publication responsibilities. A PFTAC
GDDS mission in February 2004 concluded that rebuilding the statistical system will require
extensive technical assistance and external funding. Following its recommendations, a new
government statistician was appointed in 2004 and a long-term adviser (18 months)—funded
by AusAid and NZAid—took up his post in April 2005.
The NSO is currently conducting a Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES), after
which it plans to rebase the CPI, and construct national headline and underlying CPIs,
national accounts and poverty data by early 2007. The NSO has conducted business surveys
on employment and financial data covering 2003 and 2004, the results of which are expected
in the second half of September 2006. Preparations for a Demographic and Health Survey
started in mid-2006. The Ministry of Tourism, in coordination with NSO, has started a
project to measure tourism spending. A population census is planned for late 2009, with
preparations expected to commence in 2007. The CBSI has requested PFTAC assistance to
improve the quality of their BOP and national accounts. The NSO has requested PFTAC’s
assistance to enhance government finance statistics, and the Secretariat of the Pacific
Community’s (SPC) assistance to rebase the CPI.
The NSO has prepared, with PFTAC’s assistance, a prototype of government finance
statistics tables based on recurrent revenue and expenditure data provided by the Ministry of

56
Finance. However, this work is still preliminary and hindered by the dearth of aid and
development spending information. Audits of state enterprise accounts are currently under
way and, once completed, should provide a better picture of public sector finances.
The February 2006 PFTAC mission identified a number of statistical issues that still require
attention, including: (i) ensuring that compilation methodologies are applied consistently for
GDP and BOP data; and (ii) collecting prices for additional items in the CPI, particularly on
diesel fuel and telecommunications products. In the area of the BOP, there is a need to:
(i) increase the response rate to enterprise surveys to reduce reliance on FET records;
(ii) investigate alternative data to supplement FET data, including the use of official transfers
data from the government’s financial accounts; and (iii) review the Customs merchandise
data for use in the BOP. To address the latter issues, PFTAC plans to send a short-term BOP
expert in the second half of June 2006.
The effectiveness of the NSO continues to be hampered by weak technological skills among
its staff and low survey response rates, which it is seeking to address through tougher
penalties under the Statistics Act.

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with the
Solomon Islands
the Solomon Islands
On October 4, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Solomon Islands.1
Background
The economic recovery and stability prevailing since the 2003 intervention of the Regional
Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) has continued. Per capita real GDP
growth has remained respectable, inflation is under control, and budget discipline has been
maintained. Thanks to official development assistance (ODA) and private foreign direct
investment (FDI) mainly in two new large projects, international reserves have continued to
increase.
Real GDP growth was 5 percent in 2005, about 2¼ percentage points above the Pacific
Islands Countries’ (PICs) average, driven by agriculture, fishing, and fiscal stimulus, with
logging still over four times the sustainable level. In 2006, logging is not anticipated to
contribute for the first time since 2001, but real GDP growth is still projected to exceed
5 percent, driven by agriculture, mainly the start of palm oil production, and services. Inflation
ended in the high single digits in 2005, reflecting high oil prices, expatriates’ demand, and
rapid private credit growth. Inflation is expected to be broadly unchanged in 2006, thus
remaining about 2 percent above the PICs’ average.
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.
1

2

The 2006 budget of the central government envisages a shift to a deficit of ¾ percent of GDP
from a 2¼ percent surplus in 2005, due to a 21 percent real increase in goods and services
purchases and domestically financed development spending. But, the outturn is projected to
be about 1 percentage point of GDP better than budgeted, with higher spending in low-priority
areas (wage bill, tertiary scholarships, and representation) likely to be more than offset by
revenue overperformance and investment underspending.
With soaring fuel and investment-related imports, the current account swung into an
11 percent of GDP deficit in 2005. However, official international reserves climbed to
US$95 million (5¼ months of projected 2006 imports) due to robust ODA and FDI
flows⎯mainly by the palm oil company and for the rehabilitation of a gold mine. The current
account deficit is projected to widen in 2006, owing to higher oil prices and investment-related
imports. But, continued strong ODA and FDI flows are expected to keep reserves above 5
months of imports.
Reserve money growth eased reflecting a moderation in net foreign assets growth in 2005,
while broad money increased by 28 percent as the remonetization of the economy continued.
Private sector credit rebounded strongly from a low base, growing 50 percent in real terms,
reducing banks’ excess reserves to 36 percent of deposits from 40 percent at end-2004.
The growth of all monetary aggregates is expected to moderate in 2006.
Although the economy has performed well in the past three years, structural reforms remain
essential to raise the prospects of sustainable growth, reduce poverty, and lessen the
economy’s vulnerability to shocks. Progress on this front has been mixed. Logging duty
exemptions have been curtailed and tax exemptions guidelines have been issued. The Foreign
Investment Bill has been passed and is now in effect. However, further reforms are urgent in
the area of governance, state-owned enterprises, infrastructure, and business environment.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for maintaining macroeconomic stability and
noted that near-term growth prospects are reasonably favorable. Looking ahead, Directors
underscored the need to promote new sources of growth to raise living standards, particularly
in light of the unsustainable pace of logging activities. Given the deep-rooted obstacles to
private investment, weak institutions, and rapid population growth, this formidable task will
require continued acceleration of the structural reform agenda and the maintenance of
financial stability.
Directors encouraged the authorities to craft the 2007–10 national development strategy into
the main vehicle for policy formulation and aid coordination, and called on the authorities to
incorporate all projects and programs in this strategy, including those run by donors, and to set
up a system to track aid delivery. Directors underscored that backing the strategy with a
realistic medium-term framework and linking it to the budget will be instrumental for its
effective implementation.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to remain within the budget in 2006 and
encouraged them to refrain from spending unutilized investment project appropriations and
revenue overperformance. Over the medium term, they emphasized that budget consolidation

3
is necessary in light of the limited domestic and external financing sources and the need to
reduce the high public debt. Directors stressed the need to replace declining logging and
import revenues with domestic taxes, improve expenditure quality, and reorient spending from
the wage bill toward infrastructure, especially transport and communications.
Directors welcomed the introduction of tax exemption guidelines and the gazetting of the new
foreign investment bill. They urged the authorities to accelerate tax reform to widen the base
and reduce cascading, and public financial management reforms to ensure better governance
in the use of public funds and aid flows. Directors considered that the poor performance of
state-owned enterprises (SOEs), especially in the utilities sector, required urgent attention and
recommended a comprehensive restructuring to improve service delivery and their financial
position. They also cautioned that fiscal decentralization should be approached very carefully,
as it would likely weaken fiscal discipline under present circumstances.
Directors agreed that the risk of debt distress remains high given the sizable public debt level,
the country’s vulnerability to shocks, and the possible increase in contingent liabilities given
the weak finances of SOEs and provincial governments. They welcomed the authorities’
progress in regularizing debt and the government’s policy of no new borrowing, which should
apply to all public entities, including SOEs, until the public debt profile has improved
substantially.
Directors endorsed the current exchange rate policy, and agreed that downward pressure on
the exchange rate should not be resisted. They were of the view that competitiveness appears
adequate, in light of the prospects for nontimber exports, including agricultural and mineral
products. Directors supported efforts to develop the central bank’s inflation forecasting ability,
which they viewed as critical in ensuring a timely monetary policy response should inflation
pressures intensify or reserves come under pressure.
Directors agreed that the commercial banks appear sound. To strengthen the overall financial
sector, they recommended the liquidation of the troubled Development Bank of Solomon
Islands. Directors encouraged the continued use of commercially-based mechanisms to
broaden access to banking services and credit, and the development of conservative
investment guidelines to enable the National Provident Fund (NPF) to improve its profitability
by investing abroad. They added that approving the new NPF bill would enhance the
institution’s governance.
Directors regretted that the weak statistical database hampers surveillance, but were
encouraged by measures underway to improve real and external sector data.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV
Consultation with the Solomon Islands is also available.
