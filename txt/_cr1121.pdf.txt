ISRAEL1
Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the European Department
Approved by Adam Bennett and Aasim Husain
December 21, 2010
Israel passed through the global recession swiftly. The challenge now is to sustain growth
and low inflation while boosting medium-term prospects—in the context of continued global
uncertainty, shekel appreciation, and a housing market that is overheating.
Buoyant activity and employment alongside incipient inflation pressures calls for the
overall stance of policies to be tightened more quickly than planned. But the onus for the
accelerated effort should fall mainly on fiscal rather than monetary policy. This shift in the
policy center of gravity will help to contain inflation, reduce upward pressure on the shekel,
and support the new fiscal rule. Alongside, monetary policy should focus on inflation and
move further towards a neutral stance. In so doing, it should continue to respond to shocks to
global demand, and foreign exchange intervention should become more symmetric. Steps to
rebalance housing supply and demand can support these efforts. To secure Israel’s mediumterm prospects, greater coordination between the authorities responsible for the stability of the
financial system, and enhanced procedures governing medium-term public spending will be
essential.
The 2010 Article IV discussions were held in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv during November
17–29. The team comprised Mr. Doyle (Head, EUR), Ms. Budina (FAD), Mr. Cipriani (INS),
and Mr. Roger (MCM). Mr. Friedmann (Advisor, OED) attended most meetings. The mission
met with Minister of Finance Steinitz, Governor of the Central Bank Fischer, representatives of
the Prime Minister’s office, and other senior officials, academics, and private sector
representatives. A joint press conference was held with the authorities at the conclusion of the
mission.
The mission’s concluding statement was published on November 29, 2010 and can be
found at: http://www.imf.org/external/np/ms/2010/112910.htm.

I. BACKGROUND
Following a moderate slowdown in 2009, Israel’s economy has rebounded decisively1
1.
Output fell mildly and for only 2 quarters from Q4 2008, and for 2009 as a whole
growth was 0.8 percent, and is projected to rise to some 4 percent in 2010 (See Selected
Economic Issues (SEI) I). Despite public debt around 80 percent of GDP, initial market
jitters over Israel in the wake of Lehman Bros soon subsided. There have been no signs of
sovereign debt stress—with CDS spreads in the neighborhood of 80 bps in 2010, and the
strength of long-term prospects has been underscored by recent entry into the OECD.
2.
The recovery was led by consumption and exports (Text Table, Figure 1). After
falling with the onset of the 2008 global economic shock, consumer spending led the
recovery from Q2 2009. The strength of consumption was mainly in non-durables—spending
on durables fell sharply (by 6 percent in 2009) and recovered relatively slowly, but this
primarily affected imports. Exports recovered alongside from H2 2009, in part as world trade
rebounded, and they are already back at pre-crisis levels. Demand for housing construction
also picked up strongly from Q2 2009, a delayed supply response to the take-off in the
housing market which began a year earlier. But in Q3 2010, outright falls in export volumes
and sharp deceleration in private consumption may signal emerging limits on the durability
of output strength.

Credit to households, and employment buoyed consumption
3.
Credit from domestic and foreign sources to households has been buoyant—at annual
rates of some 8 percent in 2009 and 2010, but credit to non-financial firms has all but
stagnated. In part, this reflects the resilience of the banking sector, while non-banks—and
notably the corporate bond market—encountered difficulties (Box 1). Credit to firms remains
weak.
4.
Employment held up well alongside domestic demand. After a modest decline in the
first half of 2009, jobs rose 4½ percent through Q2 2010 (2.8 percent for permanent jobs),
partly cushioned from the global shock by economy-wide real wage declines of 2½ percent
in 2009—the result of cautious settlements and upside inflation surprises. As recovery has
taken hold, unemployment fell from its peak of 8 percent in early 2009 to 6 percent in
Q2 2010, with participation rates leveling off at 56 percent in 2009–10 after rising prior to
that.
And the shekel appreciated, capping inflation
5.
External developments put the shekel under considerable appreciation pressure
recently (Figure 2). Despite weakness in exports and net income receipts overall in 2009, the
current account balance strengthened by 3 percentage points of GDP—reflecting sharp falls
in durables and investment imports and falling international energy prices. With exports and
imports both recovering through Q2 2010, the current account surplus is expected to be a
little weaker in 2010 overall. On the financial account, short-term net inflows by residents
surged from end-2007 while short-term net flows by non-residents remained broadly stable.
The resulting upward pressure on the shekel paused in mid-2008, but resumed again after the
Spring of 2010 as global financial markets thawed. Since then, the cautious tightening of
domestic policies, increasing investor confidence in the relative strength of Israeli economic
prospects, and the termination of programmed intervention by BoI has seen the real value of
the shekel soar back to its mid-crisis peaks—some 15 percent above pre-crisis levels. As a
result, competitiveness has been eroded.
6.
But the strong shekel has helped to contain inflation (Figure 3). With import prices
accordingly held in check, wholesale prices are still below their mid-2008 peaks, and, until
recently, food prices have been flat since then too. Nevertheless, since end-2007, the
headline CPI has been continuously slightly above the 1–3 percent target range, partly
boosted by indirect tax hikes. It has only recently fallen back into target range, with import
prices leading the decline.
And house prices soared
7.
After many years of stagnation in nominal terms, prices of owner-occupied dwellings
rose steadily since the onset of global financial market tensions in the fall of 2007. House
prices are now 40 percent above pre-crisis levels, albeit with mixed evidence on whether or
not they are still rising. These developments partly reflect the supportive stance of

6
macrofinancial policies in the face of downturn in 2009. And by at least in part offsetting the
wealth effects on Israeli households of falling securities prices, they may have provided some
support to household consumption.
Box 1. Financial Sector Structure and Vulnerabilities
The Israeli banking system is dominated by five banks. Although profits declined
in 2008 (reflecting losses on modest holdings of domestic equity and bonds, and
limited foreign ABS exposures abroad), only one bank recorded outright losses. Banks
continued to raise capital ratios during the crisis, through retained profits, bond and
equity issues. And average risk-weighted capital ratios have risen to 13.6 percent,
while the Tier 1 capital ratio has risen to 8.5 percent. As NPLs have declined lower
provisioning needs have led to increased returns on equity and assets for most banks,
although returns remain below pre-recession levels.

The non-bank financial sector, including insurance, pensions, and mutual funds, grew
rapidly prior to the crisis, with its share of lending, through equity and bond markets,
rising to nearly half of total financing of the corporate sector. As globally, the Israeli
capital markets suffered major losses in 2008-09, and the corporate bond market
temporarily seized up at the end of 2008 (Figure 4). Insurers and pensions experienced
large losses. Since early 2009, bond and equity market prices have risen above precrisis levels, strongly boosting the performance of insurance and pension portfolios and
solvency ratios. The volume of bond and equity market issuance, however, is well off
pre-crisis levels, especially in the non-financial corporate sector.

Policies were tightened promptly, once growth was again entrenched
8.
On the fiscal side, policy tightening largely reflects automatic stabilizers—a mirror
image of the earlier loosening in 2008–09. With the budget set for two years (2009–10) and
growth higher than budgeted in both, central government nominal revenue overperformed,
especially in 2010. This occurred despite the earlier-than-anticipated reduction in the VAT
to 16 percent from January 2010. Meanwhile, nominal spending was held well below budget
in 2009 as may recur to some degree in 2010. This yielded a 0.8 and 1½ percentage point of
GDP budget overperformance in 2009 and 2010 respectively (Text Table).

9.
The 2009–10 budget and its outturn also represented the first steps to establish the
credibility of the framework of fiscal rules recently adopted targeting phased near-term
deficit reduction and capping spending growth to support progress to medium-term public
debt reduction. (See SEI II.)
10.
On the monetary policy side, Israel was the first central bank globally to commence
its tightening cycle from September 2009, raising policy rates in 25 basis point steps from
their floor of ½ percent to 2 percent by October 2010 (Figure 3). This stance was reinforced
by adoption of a new Bank of Israel Law in 2010 formalizing its established inflation
targeting practices (See SEI II). Nevertheless, the real interest rate continues to be negative,
and the overall monetary stance remains expansionary, notwithstanding the appreciation of
the shekel since mid-2008.

11
11.
With an eye on house price developments, the BoI has tightened restrictions on
housing sector financing. Penalties have been increased on lending in excess of
the 20 percent indicative limit on the share of banks’ lending. Banks have also been required
to review risks in their mortgage lending portfolios, and to raise loan-loss provisioning (by at
least 75 basis points) for loans granted since April with loan-to-value (LTV) ratios above
60 percent. This measure was reinforced from late October when the reserve requirement on
such loans was raised further. While this only raises borrowing costs by some 50 basis
points, 1/3 of new mortgages extended during 2010 exceed this LTV threshold. These
measures are seen as “warning shots”—the Bank of Israel has stated publicly that if the
housing market does not cool in response, further actions will be taken.
12.
But as growth resumed, so did calls for wage rises. While negotiations in the public
sector were consensual and recently completed—envisaging rises of 6½ percent over three
years, in line with targeted inflation—private sector wage growth has picked up.
And global prospects weaken in 2011
13.
The WEO projects a temporary slowdown of growth in advanced economies in 2011
towards 2 percent. But unlike output, growth in global trade is not projected to recover
in 2012, falling to 6½ percent in 2011 and 2012. And with the real price of oil projected
broadly unchanged from current levels, further steady declines in Israel’s terms of trade are
projected after the significant gains in 2009.

Alongside, global uncertainties remain heightened. The WEO 90 percent confidence
interval for global growth for 2011 ranges from 2–6 percent (with the 70 percent confidence
interval ranging from 3–5 percent). As a small open economy, Israel is highly exposed.
Using estimated elasticities of Israeli exports and output with respect to world growth, this
implies a 90 percent confidence interval for Israeli output ranging from 2–5 percent.
II. CORE DIAGNOSTIC ISSUES
15.
turn.

With this background, five issues are core to policy design. These are considered in
A. How Large is the Output Gap, and Will it Restrain Inflation?

16.
The output gap is likely close to zero, given that Israel was close to capacity in 2008,
experienced a relatively mild and short passage through the great recession, but nevertheless
also saw sharp falls in fixed investment. Numerical estimates based on the standard technical
measures support this view (Box 2), with—until most recently—fast falling unemployment
rates corroborating. And although headline inflation has fallen back into range, private
nominal wage growth has picked up, “break-even” inflation forecasts have risen to the upper
limit of the inflation target over the medium term. While the strong shekel has contained
inflationary pressures so far, further tightening of policies is warranted.
Box 2. The Output Gap

Box 3. Inflation

A Hodrick-Prescott filter with λ equal
to 1600, on data for 1993Q1 to 2010
Q3 suggests output above capacity in
2007, and falling below capacity in
2008-09. However, the gap appears
to be falling rapidly, to below ½ of a
percentage point of GDP at present.
(Note, output was projected forward
for 10 quarters prior to estimation to
address end-point problems.)
19

Inflation in 2010 has fallen back into target
range, despite the swiftly falling output gap
and rising wage pressures. Shekel
appreciation has been key to this. Standard
modeling of quarterly CPI by staff—
with the output gap, the NEER, and import
prices as dependent variables—suggests that,
absent the strong shekel since mid-year, the
CPI would be 1 percentage point higher in
Fall 2010 than the outturn—and therefore
still above the target range.

B. Do House Prices Presage General Inflationary of Financial Stability Strains?
17.
House prices are up over 40 percent since the great recession began (Figure 5). The
absence of a prior housing bubble, alongside long-standing supply constraints, restrictive
planning regulations, global recession safe-haven inflows, low policy interest rates, and
uninterrupted bank lending to households have conjoined to produce an uncomfortable echo
of advanced countries in the early-to-mid 2000s. But, with the possible exception of
Q2 2010, private consumption behavior seems largely unaffected by the boom—perhaps as it
offsets other losses in asset portfolios. Moreover, in contrast to recent experience elsewhere,
there is no evidence that the boom is related to a weakening of credit standards: mortgages
are “full recourse;” almost all stay on the original creditors’ books (with none packaged into
structured products), and headline delinquency rates remain low and have declined over the
past year. Additionally, loan to values remain low, although this may be a reflection of the
increase in house prices.
18.
Nonetheless, with affordability now stretched relative to historical norms, caution is
appropriate; indeed, these developments in the housing market corroborate other signs that
policies are accommodative.

C. Is the Shekel Competitive?
19.
While shekel appreciation has stemmed inflation thus far, the CPI-based real effective
exchange rate is well above its trading range in the four years to end-2007 and the ratio of
export prices to the GDP deflator is now well below ratios typical in those years (Figure 6).
20.
There is some—albeit not unqualified—evidence that the 2003–07 trading range is in
the neighborhood of the equilibrium rate, or a little below it. Not only was this range
established for a prolonged period, but at that time, there was no foreign exchange
intervention by the BoI and the economy broadly in balance—securing steady growth and
unemployment falling towards 5 percent, along with sustained low inflation. The current
account was in surplus, but this reflects structural factors: a relatively low fixed investment
ratio (20 percent of GDP in 2007, a boom year) in part due to enduring geopolitical risk; and
high and rising private savings ratios, boosted by the commencement of a 30-year long
phased switch from defined benefit to defined contribution pension schemes for new cohorts
of labor market entrants, which began at the end of the millennium.
21.
Since then, the strong economic performance of Israel relative to core advanced
counties may have raised the equilibrium rate somewhat—at least until the core recovers—
with a further boost possible by recent discovery of significant offshore natural gas reserves.
But quantifying the size and duration of the former remains uncertain, and the latter is
attenuated the relatively modest size—perhaps 30 percent of GDP in NPV terms—of the
discoveries relative to other natural resource exporters, and because the authorities intend to
apply the proceeds to public debt reduction.
22.
Furthermore, formal CGER estimates of competitiveness remain dispersed, as they
were a year ago. The Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate (ERER) measure, like the CPI-REER,
suggests that the shekel is significantly on the strong side. But the macro balance and
external stability estimates suggest that it is undervalued. Both latter measures may
exaggerate competitiveness in Israel, notably as both reflect an assumption that the impact on
savings rates of the continued phased pension reforms has ended, even though the phasing
itself has many years to run.

23.
In resolving the assessment of competitiveness in the face of these conflicting
indicators, it is notable that broader macroeconomic signs of overvaluation in Israel are
becoming evident. Israel’s export market share globally and in advanced countries fell in
H1 2010, with outright export declines in Q3, falling FDI inflows, continued weakness in
non-housing fixed investment all constituting cautionary signs, and even a small pickup in
the unemployment rate in Q3 2010. Nevertheless, “noise” in the global economy may cloud
interpretation of these indicators.
24.
Accordingly, in assessing overall competitiveness of the shekel, the ERER and direct
price measures are emphasized relative to the MB and ES measures. On this basis, the shekel
could be somewhat on the strong side (i.e., overvalued). While there are significant margins
of uncertainty around that assessment, further significant and sustained appreciation beyond
current rates would tilt the balance of this judgment decisively.
D. Are Capital Inflows Set to Continue or Even Intensify?
25.
There is risk of significant and sustained exchange rate appreciation beyond current
rates appears high, however. As discussed above, relatively strong Israeli economic
performance has been reflected in the policy interest rate differential and strong portfolio
inflows in 2010 (Figure 7). On WEO projections showing advanced country deceleration
in 2011, the divergences in policy interest rates appear set to persist. So early relief from—let
alone reversal of—these appreciation pressures is unlikely.
26.
Policy would thus best be predicated—in the central case—on addressing these
inflows pressures as “enduring” rather than as “short-lived” phenomena. And they require a
purposeful policy response to the extent that they have already eroded competitiveness and to
the extent that they may yet do so.
E. Are Sovereign Risks Significant?
27.
Israeli sovereign financing and CDS spreads remained firm during the global
recession. Increases in headline debt ratios and contingent liabilities from the financial sector
were limited, the maturity structure of debt is long, and economic growth and its outlook are
strong. Fiscal risks are not imminent. But spreads spiked in the wake of Lehman and global
post-crisis strains compound perennial Israeli geopolitical risks—so strengthened
macroeconomic buffers would be helpful. These include further reductions in public debt
(See SEI IV).
28.
In summary, inflation and housing pressures signal a need for policy tightening, while
the nexus of competitiveness and capital flows issues underscore the premium on doing so
without compounding upward pressures on the shekel. This, and the need to continue longrun public debt reduction, places fiscal adjustment at the heart of policy recommendations.

III. MACROFINANCIAL POLICY SETTINGS—2011–12
A. Central Case Macroeconomic Projections
29.
Staff central case projections, predicated on the WEO and the Israeli authorities’
announced policy frameworks, reflect the assessments outlined above.
30.
In particular, in accord with the ceilings on the headline deficit under the new fiscal
rule, the 2011–12 two-year budget anticipates a decline in the deficit from 4 percent of GDP
in 2010 to 3 and 2 percent of GDP in 2011 and 2012 respectively. It assumes growth of 4
percent in 2011 and 2012, with inflation on target. Alongside, further moderate monetary
policy tightening is anticipated.
31.
In this light, with Israel’s growth momentum checked by international deceleration
and domestic fiscal consolidation, staff projections show GDP growth of some 4 percent
in 2010, falling back to 3½ percent in 2011 before recovering again in 2012 (see Text Table
and Table 5). Inflationary pressures are expected to show up in 2011–12, although partially
checked by continued shekel strength. Inflation is projected to decline back to the mid-point
of the target range and capital inflows pressures are expected to ease thereafter. But until
then, competitiveness and external performance are projected to suffer.

B. Fiscal Policy
Fiscal consolidation is needed
32.
Given need for consolidation and to establish the credibility of the framework of
fiscal rules, the authorities’ plans therefore mark an essential step in the right direction.
33.
The 2011–12 budget anticipates a 0.8 percentage point of GDP strengthening in the
structural primary balance in 2011 and a further 0.6 percentage point strengthening in 2012.
Furthermore, nominal revenues net of tax policy changes grow some 4 percentage points
higher than nominal GDP. This allows expenditure to rise in accord with the new rule
consistent with the corresponding path for deficit ceilings.
34.
On the tax side, income tax rates fall as anticipated.2 However, additional revenue
efforts, such as postponing the earlier anticipated ½ a percentage point reduction in the VAT
rate to 15½ percent from 2011 to 2013, and increasing energy and other excise taxes in 2011,
will increase revenue. In 2012, additional energy tax increases will offset the impact of
planned tax cuts. On the spending side, outlays grow at 2.66 percent for 2011–12, adjusted
with the forecast average inflation rate, in line with the ceilings under the new expenditure
rule (SEI IV). Within this, the budget secures a switch in outlays from defense to higher
education.

2

This reform included tax policy changes in PIT and CIT as follows: In 2011, some PIT tax brackets will be
widened but the tax rates are unchanged, while over 2012-2016 the reform includes a schedule of cuts in all PIT
rates besides the two lowest - by 1 percent a year through 2012-2015 and by 2 percent to 39 percent in 2016.
The reform also envisages a schedule of corporate income tax cuts – by 1 percent a year through 2011 – 2015
and by 2 percent to 18 percent in 2016.

But planned consolidation may be insufficient
35.
Even with the structural budget deficit set on a downward track, capital inflows and
associated competitiveness concerns persist. The tools available to address those issues
directly—including intervention, macroprudential instruments, and capital controls—have
proven to have limited effectiveness and notable costs (see section B below). There is
therefore a case for accelerating the planned consolidation to address these concerns. Counter
concerns—that growth might falter and require continued fiscal support—are attenuated by
scope for monetary relaxation in such a context—given Bank of Israel policy rates at 2
percent (See SEI III). Accordingly, the planned structural consolidation would best be
regarded as the minimum—with significant broader macroeconomic benefits to be accrued
from going further and faster.

22
Additional consolidation can be accomplished without amending the budget
36.
As budget operation mechanisms and expenditure reserves allow considerable scope
to hold spending below the allocations (as evident from the 2009–10 budget outturns), one
option would be to operate the 2011–12 budget in this way. As this additional consolidation
can be done via freezing reserves, it does not require amendment of the budget.
Uncertainties in the revenue outlook may also require action
37.
The difficulties in fully accounting for outturns in 2009–10, notably in respect of
corporation tax, give rise to associated uncertainties in the revenue projections for 2011–12.
Accordingly, if during 2011 receipts appear to be falling below target, even with macro
projections broadly on track or better than expected, corrective steps will be required at an
early stage. With discretionary spending restraint already devoted to securing structural overperformance as discussed above, such revenue shortfalls would likely have to be addressed
on the revenue side, with action on indirect taxes—in line with OECD recommendations-one of the options.
And a full review of the taxation of non-renewable resources is warranted
38.
Given significant natural gas discoveries, a review of the current tax structure is
appropriate at an early stage. The establishment by the Ministry of Finance of a commission
to review the current tax arrangement is thus welcome. The commission’s general intention
to raise the “tax take” from these activities to advanced country norms is fully appropriate.
Reforms to adopt international best practice in this area, including appropriate pricing
arrangements in the tax and securing appropriate intergenerational distribution of the
proceeds are also encouraged. Accordingly, the first use of such tax receipts should be to
reduce public debt, given that overall revenues will be modest on current estimates of the
volume of gas. But if large additional finds are made, revenues should be placed in a
sovereign wealth fund for intergenerational equity and to avert Dutch disease.
C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
Monetary policy faces a dilemma
39.
With output recovering and the crisis passing more swiftly than anticipated, the BoI
correctly acted early, beginning the withdrawal of stimulus.
40.
And the cessation of preprogrammed forex intervention began the process back
towards the BoI’s eventual aim to return to a freely floating exchange rate regime—in which
intervention occurs only in the most exceptional circumstances to address market disorder, as
in the decade up to 2008. In the meantime, intervention continues and Israel’s exchange rate
regime remains classified as “floating.” These steps were reinforced by the adoption of a new
Bank of Israel Law. (See SEI II.)

23
41.
But unemployment is close to historical lows, core inflation is at the upper end of the
target range, and inflation expectations—even out as long as 5 years—have risen from the
center of the target range to the top. Markets are currently factoring an increase in the policy
rate by 75–100 basis points over the coming year, which would bring real interest rates just
into a positive range. But even in that context, inflation expectations remain well above the
middle of the target range through the medium-term.
42.
Further tightening is needed. Delays would risk a further acceleration of inflation to
the top, or even above the target range, and associated need for subsequent disinflation.
Various policy instruments could help resolve the dilemma
43.
The first best option would be through additional fiscal consolidation—as noted
above. But recognizing that additional fiscal effort—even within the existing two-year
budget parameters—is challenging, consideration could also be given, in principle, to use of
other instruments to address these dilemmas—intervention; macroprudential instruments, and
various forms of capital controls. In Israel’s context, however, each has some drawbacks:
Intervention—but it would be one-sided, and might need to be large.
44.
Given the small size of the market, there is some evidence of effectiveness and
market commentary routinely points to the scale of action the authorities’ have undertaken.3
But scope for further intervention is qualified by the high level of reserves (US$ 65 billion,
15 months of 2007 imports) and by the associated BoI losses.
45.
And sustained one-sided intervention carries risks. In particular, it may come to be
seen by markets as qualifying the authorities’ commitment to allow the exchange rate to
broadly track its fundamentals. This risk arises even if intervention is aimed to respond to
sustained capital inflows arising from the “temporary” growth differential between Israel and
core advanced countries.
46.
This conundrum is further grounds for addressing the issue with fiscal policy. But
absent that additional support, intervention should more clearly remain focused on addressing
disorderly conditions, rather than becoming central to resolving dilemmas in responding to
capital inflows, competitiveness and inflation concerns, even if this means allowing the
exchange rate to appreciate.
Macro prudential instruments—but not as the centerpiece of policy restraint
47.
Banks are already subject to reserve requirements and to the high LTV additional
requirements for mortgage lending, both of which could be raised further if needed.
3

BoI research finds a consistent “unexplained residual” in exchange rate equations during the period of
preprogrammed intervention

24
Furthermore, the BoI is also responsible for consumer protection arrangements in the
banking system. But given the advanced stage of the cycle, there may be a role for
accelerated and anti-cyclical progress to raise bank capital standards towards goals under
Basle III (See below). However, such instruments cannot bear the full burden of policy
restraint, but they could support conventional fiscal and monetary instruments to that end.
Capital controls—but effectiveness is uncertain
48. Controls on particular kinds of inflows could in principle play a role if the affected
flows are large and have low substitutability with other kinds of flows. But efforts to satisfy
this requirement internationally have typically run aground when the inflows were large and
enduring and Israel has little recent experience with controls, which on earlier occasions
focused on curbing outflows rather than inflows. The signaling effects of such a step could
also be problematic.
49. Given downsides to each of these alternative means of reconciling inflationary and
competitiveness concerns, additional fiscal effort remains the option of choice.
D.

Financial Stability

Banks proved resilient to global downturn, and have strengthened further
50.
Financial stability indicators suggest that the resilience of the banking system has
increased over the past year. Capital adequacy ratios, notably including Tier 1 capital relative
to risk-weighted assets, have risen for most banks, while impaired and non-performing loan
ratios have declined. Indicators of credit risk also appear strong; although household
leveraging has increased somewhat in recent years, the overall level is low, and mortgage
loan-to-value ratios are also low by international standards. Banks maintain highly liquidity,
and interbank and direct exchange rate risk exposures are small.
Non-banks have also strengthened, but concerns remain
51.
In the non-bank financial sector, solvency ratios are now comfortably above pre-crisis
levels, and the evidence points to conservative portfolio allocations.
52.
The performance of non-bank financial institutions is closely tied to that of the
domestic capital markets which are, in turn, highly sensitive to external capital market
developments. This represents an important source of vulnerability. In addition, there are
lingering concerns with the quality of some corporate credit. The corporate sector is heavily
dependent on bond financing, reflected in the high ratio of domestic bond issues to GDP
(currently over 25 percent of GDP), so that if a problem did emerge with one of the country’s
large conglomerates, the impact on institutional investor portfolios could be substantial.

25
Banks are well-positioned ahead of regulatory reform--Basle III
53.
The Israeli banking system should be well-positioned to cope with the introduction of
higher capital requirements under Basel III. Regulatory and Tier 1 capital levels are already
high (Box 1) and in June 2010 the BoI issued draft guidelines to banks to achieve targets for
core capital of at least 7.5 percent by the end of the year.
54.
The adoption of higher capital requirements will tend to have a countercyclical
macroeconomic impact. In the current macroeconomic context, this could usefully
complement initiatives to restrain demand, especially as it would tend to dampen upward
pressure on the shekel exchange rate. However, it is not clear how large an effect the
adoption of higher capital requirements will have, partly because it is difficult to judge how
large banks’ desired capital buffers are, or how they will be affected by adoption of higher
capital requirements.
But financial sector supervision needs to be strengthened and better coordinated
55.
Effective use of macroprudential tools will require the BoI to strengthen its
monitoring and analysis of financial vulnerabilities and transmission mechanisms. On the
monetary policy side, this will involve deeper analysis of financial aggregates, and closer
monitoring of financial market developments. On the financial stability side, stress testing
methods are being developed, but there is far to go.
56.
In particular, stress tests need to draw on more detailed, bank by bank data, as well as
making full use of information on corporate and household balance sheet data. Testing
should also be undertaken in collaboration with CMISD in order to capture cross-sectoral
linkages and vulnerabilities, and in collaboration with the main banks. They also need to be
closely linked to the macroeconomic forecasting framework in order to assess the dynamic
impact on financial stability of prospective macroeconomic developments or risks. Such
analysis needs to be fed into decision making on the use of macroprudential tools as well as
micro-prudential supervision, and BoI should begin publication of a Financial Stability
Report on a regular basis to complement the Monetary Policy Report.
57.
The BoI needs to be able to maintain adequate numbers of well-qualified staff in
order to develop the above capabilities. There is also a need to set up or modify decisionmaking arrangements in the BoI to ensure that decisions on macro-prudential policy are as
well-informed, systematic and accountable as in the monetary policy arena.
58.
The adequacy of resources, capabilities, autonomy and accountability of the non-bank
financial supervisors—the Israeli Securities Authority (ISA) and the Capital Markets,
Insurance and Savings Division (CMISD) of the Ministry of Finance—should also be
comprehensively reviewed. A series of recent Article IV consultations have recommended
that the CMISD be shifted out of the MoF in order to better address the resource and
accountability issues, as well as to minimize potential conflicts of interest arising from
having the regulator within the MoF. In particular, there appears to be need to separate the

26
roles of “supervisor” from that of “promoter of the sector.” This does not mean that the
CMISD should necessarily gravitate toward the BoI; that is only one option, and in most
OECD countries, the pension and insurance regulators are housed outside the central bank,
either in a fully independent position, or as part of a unified, but independent financial
services authority.
59.
Finally, institutional arrangements need to be put in place to coordinate a
comprehensive approach by the three supervisory agencies on financial stability issues and
the use of macro-prudential instruments. The financial stability councils being put in place in
Europe and the United States offer possible templates for Israel, but it will be essential to
tailor any model to the specifics of Israel’s institutional arrangements, as well as the
characteristics of its financial system.
IV. VIEWS OF THE AUTHORITIES
60.
The authorities agreed with the overall assessment of economic developments and
the nature of the policy dilemmas, including concern with the housing market. They also
agreed that further withdrawal of stimulus is needed, noting that this is planned by fiscal
consolidation according to the deficit reduction law on the fiscal side and anticipated on the
monetary side. And they agreed that this process should pose as little risk to competitiveness
as possible. They welcomed staff endorsement of the intention to move the taxation of
natural gas towards international norms, and of the role of macroprudential instruments in
policy on the housing market. Within that overall agreement, however, some significant
differences of emphasis were noted.
Macroeconomic developments 2010–11
61.
The authorities’ central view is that the shekel is a little overvalued. But the policy
dilemmas arising are similar to those of staff because the authorities emphasize overvaluation
risk “at the margin.” In particular, with policy interest rate differentials with the United States
already at some 2 percentage points, further tightening of monetary policy is thought likely to
induce further short-term capital inflows which will, in turn, contribute to overvaluation
unless offsetting actions are taken.
62.
Similarly, in regard to housing, the monetary authorities were a little more confident
than staff that house prices are not excessively detached from fundamentals, with their
concerns focused on the strength of the upward momentum. In some contrast, the fiscal
authorities considered that house prices had already peaked, and may even have begun to fall
a little. But both agreed with staff that further measures to ensure that a bubble did not
emerge in this market were needed, with both supply and demand side measures appropriate.
Fiscal Policy
63.
The fiscal authorities acknowledge the dilemmas posed by continued capital inflows
and the role that fiscal policy can play in response. But they remain committed to the path of

27
budget consolidation that they have set out. They emphasize the priority they attach to
adherence to their framework of rules, with even adjustments which would secure a strong
performance relative to those rules possibly raising doubts about the framework. And they
noted that a further tightening might be inappropriate given risk of global weakness.
64.
These considerations are compounded by constraints on the expenditure and taxation
sides. They emphasize the relatively low level of public expenditure of GDP—especially
excluding security-related outlays—compared with the OECD, even allowing for the shift
from security to higher education outlays that was achieved in the 2011–12 budget. Even
committing to withhold the expenditure reserves could be difficult if the contingencies that
they are intended to anticipate are realized. And as tax revenue reductions are a cornerstone
policy objective of the administration—already compromised in the delay to VAT reduction
and in excise rate rises—room for maneuver on this side is also limited.
65.
They acknowledge, however, that revenue projections are in some doubt due to the
imperfectly understood path of receipts during the recession and will keep this under close
review and stand ready to act if shortfalls emerge.
Monetary Policy and Intervention Policy
66.
The authorities acknowledge the concerns about inflation prospects that are reflected
in medium-term inflation expectations rising to the top of the target band. But they note that
this indicator does not correct for the risk premium, and they are leery of tightening on the
basis of an unduly uncertain estimate of the NAIRU. While unemployment is low, structural
changes in the labor market may mean that the NAIRU is lower still, and longstanding low
participation and employment rates point to a reservoir of unused resources in the economy.
67.
Discretionary foreign exchange rate intervention also retains a significant role. With
capital flows exhibiting irrational behavior even in “normal” times, the inflows since 2008
include a significant element that is unrelated to “fundamentals.” As the foreign exchange
market is relatively small, intervention—both preprogrammed and discretionary—has proven
effective not only at curtailing daily noise, but also at attenuating trends. In this context,
intervention should be symmetric but only over a fairly long time horizon. This is reflected in
the decision to operate a managed float under which the shekel has moved considerably in
both nominal and real effective terms—which underscores the commitment to the float.
68.
Furthermore, even with monetary policy ready and able to adjust rapidly to
realization of global risks, there is concern not to tighten more aggressively now given
competitiveness concerns “at the margin” and given the risk of adverse global outcomes—
even though these risks have receded in recent months.
69.
Capital controls are a “never-say-never” option. But reservations about their
effectiveness and signaling mean they are not regarded as an immediate alternative at this
stage.

28
Supervision of non-banks
70.
The optimal location and structure of non-bank supervisors—and of all supervisors—
remains under review by the authorities. The fiscal authorities emphasize the benefits to the
dynamism and reform of the non-bank sector of the housing of the regulators in the Ministry,
the strong information flows to the fiscal authority that is possible thereby, and the
strengthening of resources that has been achieved in the past year. The monetary authorities
see a general case to unify all risk supervision within the central bank, with all supervisors
maintaining close coordination with the fiscal authorities from there. But neither see a case
for early action, noting that debate on this matter should not distract attention from the broad
range of supervisory initiatives that are under way. These issues might usefully constitute
one element for discussion in the requested FSAP.
V. SUMMARY AND STAFF APPRAISAL
71.
Israel was well prepared for the global recession, and responded decisively to it.
Low leverage and strong policy frameworks underpinned good preparations; while sharp cuts
in policy interest rates to ½ a percent led the policy response, supported by pre-programmed
foreign exchange intervention, accommodation of large automatic stabilizers, and steps to
contain financial sector stress. Alongside, policy frameworks were strengthened—a new
Bank of Israel Law, increased bank capital requirements, entry into the OECD, and
underpinning all these, a new fiscal rule targeting debt reduction. In addition, an innovative
“two-year” budget framework was initiated, which helped stabilize expectations further.
72.
As a result, growth remained positive throughout. It was just under 1 percent
in 2009, and is set to grow around 4 percent in 2010. And unemployment is already back
down to around 6 percent, close to its historic low.
73.
With growth, withdrawal of policy stimulus has begun. The BoI policy rate has
been raised, forex intervention has been reduced and is now discretionary, and stabilizers
have put the headline fiscal deficit back on a downward track. Nevertheless, with real
interest rates negative and the budget in structural deficit, the overall policy stance remains
expansionary.
74.
But strains have emerged. Buoyed by global capital movements, the shekel
appreciated by some 15 percent in real terms relative to pre-crisis levels, and is still rising.
While this has helped to contain inflation, inflation expectations across the medium term
have risen to the top of the target band, in the context of an output gap that has all but closed.
And nominal house prices have risen over 40 percent in two years.
75.
Monetary policy faces a difficult choice between addressing these strains and
sustaining competitiveness. Rising inflation would suggest a need to raise rates. Capital
inflows and strengthening shekel, eroding competitiveness, would argue otherwise. This
dilemma can only be resolved by harnessing another policy instrument.

29
76.
Accordingly, the authorities rightly plan fiscal consolidation. Headline deficit
reductions to 3 and 2 percent of GDP in 2011 and 2012 respectively imply structural
consolidation of some 1½ percentage points of GDP over those two years. Alongside, further
increases in the BoI policy rate of 75–100 basis points are anticipated during 2011. In this
context, growth is projected to slow to 3½ percent in 2011 before rising again in 2012.
77.
But given sustained capital inflows, the announced fiscal trajectory still leaves
monetary policy with too stark a choice between addressing inflation concerns and
sustaining competitiveness.
78.
Accordingly, fiscal deficit reduction may need to be more rapid than planned. A
strengthening of the planned fiscal stance for 2011 and beyond—by some 1 percentage point
of GDP in structural terms—is recommended. This action would dampen demand growth,
lowering inflation pressures, thereby allowing a slower rise in BoI rates than would otherwise
be needed. In turn, this would ease upward pressure on the shekel.
79.
A mix of expenditure and tax actions could be used to achieve this objective.
The latitude under the budget operation mechanisms to hold spending below budgeted
authorizations—including by retention of all the various reserves in the budget—should be
applied. This action avoids need to change the approved budget. But if this greater-thanplanned structural consolidation is to be secured, risks on the revenue side—arising from
generous official estimates—may also need to be addressed. With discretionary spending
restraint already assigned to strengthen the deficit, indirect taxes may need to be raised in line
with OECD recommendations.
80.
On the monetary side, with output and employment buoyant and inflation
expectations high, further progress towards a neutral stance is needed. If fiscal policy is
tightened as recommended, policy rates could rise broadly as is now anticipated. But if not, a
faster than anticipated rise in policy rates will be needed—albeit at the expense of
competitiveness—to head off risk of higher inflation and the need to correct that later. But
given nominal policy rates already well above the lower bound, monetary policy can also
play a key role in responding to global uncertainty. Policymakers should remain ready to act
decisively—swiftly raising policy rates if upside global risks materialize, and vice versa.
81.
With the balance of core policies adjusted in this way to address immediate
strains, other policy instruments could also play a supportive role. Further foreign
exchange intervention on both sides could help to sustain orderly market conditions. But
given that reserves and central bank sterilization losses are already considerable, and that
persistent one-sided use of this instrument undermines the credibility of the floating
exchange rate regime, it is ill-suited as the main means of reconciling inflation and
competitiveness objectives. Likewise, capital controls could be considered after other policy
options have been fully deployed. But any use of them would have to be focused in ensuring
effectiveness in the face of sustained pressures. And accelerated progress towards the

30
eventual Basle III capital requirements for banks, especially if coupled with countercyclical
buffers, could support restraint.
82.
With supervision and regulation being strengthened in various ways, the
available indicators of financial stability are reassuring—but limited in scope. Capital
adequacy and impaired loans have improved and non-bank financial institutions have
advanced similarly. But with stress testing still focused at sub-sector level and in its early
stages, and a number of indicators of risk not available, caution is warranted. Though perhaps
masked by the cycle, credit quality in the corporate bond market remains a lingering concern
following its rapid expansion since 2004, as does the latent threat to banking stability if rapid
house price inflation continues.
83.
Accordingly, further progress is needed to strengthen diagnosis and
management of risks. Stress testing procedures should give added focus to systemic risk
assessed over longer horizons. Diagnosis and formulation of the appropriate policy
responses requires full collaboration between and within supervisory institutions, as well as
routine guidance from and feedback to all the authorities responsible for stability, including
the BoI and the MoF. Such steps should proceed promptly, to be reviewed in the requested
FSAP. And in line with typical OECD practice, non-bank supervision would best be moved
out of the MoF. This would establish its independence and address resource constraints.
There are a number of good options for where it should go—including the option chosen by
about half of OECD countries of full independence.
84.
Continued structural reform remains essential. This includes progress in
education, research, the business environment, and infrastructure.
85.
Staff recommends that Israel should remain on the standard 12–month consultation
cycle.

ANNEX I: ISRAEL—PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY AND RISKS
1.
Fiscal institutions in Israel – such as the fiscal rules, which limit deficit and
real spending growth - have helped to reduce public debt form very high levels.
Strong growth, sizeable primary surpluses, and real exchange appreciation helped reduce
public debt by some 20 percentage points of GDP since 2003, reaching 77 percent of
GDP in 2008. Foreign-currency debt has fallen markedly as well, as the improved fiscal
position facilitated government access to the domestic capital market. Despite the fiscal
deterioration in response to the global shock in 2009, public debt ratio remained broadly
stable, owing to Israel’s resilience to global economic shock, but also to anchoring longterm fiscal expectations on sustainability through the introduction of a new mediumterm fiscal rule (See SEI IV).
2.
Israel’s projected path of fiscal policy – based on the new fiscal rules – does
imply a gradual decline in public debt to about 60 percent of GDP. Despite a larger
fiscal deficit, public debt is likely to fall to about 75.5 percent of GDP in 2010,
reflecting NIS appreciation, robust economic growth, and low interest rates. The
medium-term fiscal strategy, anchored by the new fiscal rules, assumes a gradual decline
in the central government deficit from 4 percent in 10 to 3 percent in 11, 2 percent in 12,
1.5 percent in 13, and 1 percent from 2014 onwards (See SEI IV). Gradual fiscal
consolidation and continued strong economic growth is likely to bring public debt down
to 62 percent of GDP by 2015.

3.
Israel’s public debt outlook is stronger than in many advanced economies,
but, this outlook is still exposed to shocks. Israel’s public debt ratio is well below the
average for advanced countries (Text
2009 Gross public debt-to-GDP ratio
chart).1 However, there is a potential
140
for high volatility in macroeconomic 120
100
variables, stemming from high
80
sensitivity of Israeli economy to
60
external shocks (See SEI III). The
40
increase in global macro-financial
20
0
risk, combined with high sensitivity
of Israeli economy to external shocks
could magnify macro-economic
volatility and increase uncertainty
around projected public debt paths.

See Fiscal Monitor database, Nov 2010.

38
For example, a sudden reversal of capital flows could possibly dampen growth, lead to
spikes in borrowing costs, and result in high exchange rate volatility.2 Furthermore,
recent econometric evidence suggest that high debt refinancing needs and high debt
levels are likely to be accompanied by higher long-term real interest rates, therefore
adversely affect global financing conditions and debt dynamics.3
4.
Risk assessments are therefore a critical input to a medium term fiscal
strategy amining at maintaining sustainability and managing risks. High
macroeconomic volatility and increased uncertainty to public debt path makes it critical
to incorporate uncertainty in the analysis of fiscal sustainability. Two different
approaches have been used to incorporate uncertainty in the fiscal sustainability
analysis. To deal with vulnerability to specific shocks and to assess robustness under
extreme events, this annex reports results from a variety of stress tests. While under a
full Monte Carlo simulation, extreme events are just one out of many realizations and
will largely be averaged out, demonstrating robustness under extreme events
demonstrating robustness under extreme events may contribute importantly to
credibility, so stress tests focusing on extreme events are a useful tool.4
5.
Stress tests reveal risks to debt consolidation strategy. The most severe
impact on public debt is produced by an adverse growth scenario – a negative permanent
shock to growth of half a standard deviation is likely to completely stall the debt
consolidation process, with public debt ratio at 76 percent in 2015. Furthermore, an
extreme tail risk of a negative permanent shock to growth of one standard deviation,
similar to the impact of the 2009 global economic shock on Israel, is likely to reverse
debt decline and to bring back public debt ratio to nearly 90 percent of GDP in 2015.
Debt consolidation process is also likely to slow down significantly under shocks from
contingent liabilities, sharp exchange rate movements, and higher interest rates
(Figure II.1). For example, fiscal contingent liabilities amounting to 10 percent of GDP
could raise public sector debt to 72 percent of GDP by 2015, while currency
depreciation of 30 percent would raise the debt ratio to about 69 percent of GDP. An

2

Rogoff (2008) used new data set to illustrate vulnerabilities of emerging markets, in particular, the fact that
sovereign debt defaults are quite sensitive to global capital flow cycle.

See IMF (2010), Fiscal Monitor. High debt ratios could increase long-term real interest rates by almost
2 percentage points, affecting negatively global financing conditions. In addition, high debt ratios are also likely
to affect negatively potential growth in advanced economies, with possible consequences for emerging markets.

It is important to note that this risk assessment assumes that fiscal rules will be adhered to only ex-ante as expost adherence to a deficit rule would imply a very large fiscal adjustment in the presence of large economic
shocks.

have been used to derive the
probability distribution of future debt stocks (“fan charts”), based on stochastic
properties of key risk variables in the debt dynamics process.5 While under the central
scenario the new fiscal rules result in further public debt reduction to slightly above 60
percent by 2015, risks surrounding public debt dynamics are still relatively high - there
is 97.5 percent chance that the maximum likely debt ratio will remain close to its 2009
level (text chart). In general, variance reducing policies, such as fiscal reaction function
could be used to lower the uncertainty around public debt past.
7.
In the medium-term, recent natural gas discoveries could have a positive
impact on fiscal sustainability. While the likely impact of the natural gas is highly
uncertain, reforms to adopt international best practice in taxation of natural resources,
including appropriate pricing arrangements in the tax and in securing appropriate
intergenerational distribution of the proceeds can help in ensuring a positive impact on
fiscal sustainability. Accordingly, the first use of such tax receipts should be to reduce
public debt, given that overall revenues will be modest on current estimates of the
volume of gas. However, if the gas wealth proves to be much larger than anticipated,
additional revenues could be placed in a sovereign wealth fund to ensure
intergenerational equity and to safeguard against possible Dutch disease effects.

missions to the WBG have been assisting the PA in the design and implementation of its
macroeconomic and fiscal framework in line with the objectives set out in the Palestinian
Reform and Development Plan (PRDP) presented at the Paris international donors'
conference in December 2007. The most recent progress report on that framework was
presented at the Ad-Hoc Liaison Committee (AHLC) meeting of donors held in New York
on September 22, 2009. Technical assistance has also been stepped up since 2007, in
particular in the areas of public expenditure management, banking supervision and

Israel—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
As of 11/10/2010
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Macroeconomic statistics are of generally high quality and broadly adequate for
surveillance, although there are few shortcomings particularly in monetary and government finance
statistics. A Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes—Data Module, a Detailed
Assessments Using the Data Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF), and a Response by the
Authorities were published on the IMF website on March 24, 2006 (IMF Country Report No. 06/125).
National Accounts: No issues to report.
Price statistics: No issues to report.
Government finance statistics: The methodology underlying the reported overall annual fiscal
balance is not in conformity with internationally accepted best practice, as interest expenditure
excludes the inflation component. The authorities are gradually moving toward implementation of the
methodology that is standard in other countries, so that the discrepancy will decline over time. Data
submitted by the Central Bureau for Statistics for the Fund’s Government Finance Statistics broadly
follows the GFSM 2001 format. However, for financial assets and liabilities, only transaction data are
submitted, but not stock data. Within-year monthly reports on central government operations—
compiled by the MoF—cover only the main aggregates of budgetary accounts, not broken down by
components.
Monetary statistics: Banking statistics are not based on balance sheet reporting, but instead on a
selection of data reported by banks to the regulatory authorities. Current information does not permit
full sectorization of the economy in the monetary statistics, and more detailed information on
instruments also would be useful.
Balance of payments: Balance of payments and international investment position data are compiled
on a quarterly basis and follow the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. External sector
data were not examined in the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with Israel
On January 7, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the 2010 Article IV consultation with Israel, and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal
without a meeting.1
Background
Israel was mildly affected by the global recession: following a slowdown in 2009, output is
projected to grow by some 4 percent in 2010, led by consumption and exports. Credit from
domestic and foreign sources to households has been buoyant—at annual rates of some
8 percent in 2009 and 2010, reflecting the resilience of the banking sector. Credit to nonfinancial firms however has been largely flat. As recovery has taken hold, unemployment has
fallen from its peak of 8 percent in early 2009 to 6 percent in 2010. With public debt a little
below 80 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), there were no signs of budget funding
stresses. The strength of long-term prospects has also been underscored by the recent entry
into the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and by the
discovery of significant offshore natural gas reserves.
As the growth outlook improved in the second half of 2009, the stance of policies was tightened.
On the fiscal side, this largely reflected automatic stabilizers. The budget deficit is estimated to

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
have declined to 3.9 percent of GDP in 2010 and is planned to strengthen to 3 percent in 2011.
Moreover, new fiscal rules were adopted in 2010 comprising deficit and spending ceilings.
On the monetary policy side, the Bank of Israel raised policy rates from their floor of half
a percent to 2 percent by October 2010. In August 2009, the central bank also discontinued its
daily purchase of US Dollars in the Foreign Exchange market, although it continues to intervene
to stem the appreciation of the shekel, with reserves reaching US$70 billion in 2010. Alongside,
a new Bank of Israel Law was adopted in 2010 formalizing established inflation targeting
practices.
In this context, the shekel came under considerable appreciation pressures, rising in real terms
to some 15 percent above pre-crisis levels. This was reflected in export market share falling in
the first half of 2010 and, in conjunction with global developments, outright export declines in
the third quarter of 2010. Nevertheless, the strong shekel has helped to contain inflation, which
has recently fallen back into its 1-3 percent target range after an extended period above it.
Israeli banks appear well-capitalized and liquid. In 2010, capital adequacy ratios rose for most
banks, and impaired and non-performing loan ratios declined. However, nominal house prices
have risen 40 percent over the past two years. Macroprudential measures were adopted by the
Bank of Israel alongside supply side measures to stabilize the sector.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2010 Article IV consultation with Israel, Executive Directors endorsed the
staff’s appraisal, as follows:
Robust fundamentals—including sustained pre-crisis fiscal consolidation—and a swift monetary
and fiscal policy response to the external downturn allowed Israel to pass through the global
recession relatively unscathed. In part, this reflects the innovation of the “two-year” budget
cycle, which helped to stabilize expectations in mid-crisis and established an important
precedent for the future.
In that light, steps taken to withdraw policy stimulus have been appropriate. As economic
growth rose through 2009-10, the budget deficit strengthened faster than planned. Alongside,
the increase in the policy rate of the Bank of Israel in several steps helped to secure a decline of
inflation back into its target range, with medium-term inflation expectations also remaining in
range.
The resilience of the economy has been strengthened by the adoption of new fiscal rules
capping spending and deficits, a new Bank of Israel Law, and by the entry into the OECD.
At the same time, strains have emerged. In particular, inflation expectations have risen towards
the upper end of the target band, nominal house prices have boomed, and the shekel has
appreciated significantly. Though all these developments reflect Israel’s relatively strong
economic performance, the authorities will need to keep them under control.

3
Accordingly, the additional policy tightening that is planned, including further fiscal deficit
reduction in 2011-12, and the anticipated further increases in the policy rates of the Bank of
Israel are welcome.
But in light of the emerging strains, additional action may be required. This would reinforce the
credibility of the overall policy framework, but it should be designed to avoid compounding
upward pressure on the shekel. Accordingly, fiscal policy should carry the burden of the
additional effort, and so a stronger than planned structural fiscal consolidation is recommended
for 2011 and 2012. In this context, monetary policy rates should rise broadly as is now
anticipated. But if fiscal policy remains as planned, policy rates may need to rise further and
more rapidly than planned—even if this puts further upward pressure on the shekel—in order to
stem inflation.
With the balance of monetary and fiscal policy tightening adjusted as recommended, other
policy instruments—notably foreign exchange intervention—can play a supportive role. Without
this rebalancing, however, there is risk that intervention could become unduly one-sided, and
the “managed” float regime could become misperceived as flexible in one direction only.
The strengthening in supervision and regulation of the financial sector and the robust indicators
of financial stability are welcome. However, further progress is needed to strengthen the
diagnosis and management of risk. To this end, the development of stress testing procedures
focusing on systemic risk, and the enhancement of the collaboration between and within
supervisory institutions is strongly encouraged. Furthermore, in line with typical OECD practice,
supervision of non-banks might be further strengthened by locating it outside the Ministry of
Finance.
Finally, in parallel with further strengthening of structural reforms, including in education,
research, the business environment, and infrastructure, effective management of resources
anticipated from discovery of significant natural gas reserves will also be necessary. In
particular, the first use of tax proceeds from gas should be to reduce public debt, and additional
funds from this source should be placed in a Sovereign Wealth Fund.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
Reader to view this pdf file) for the 2010 Article IV Consultation with Israel is also available.
