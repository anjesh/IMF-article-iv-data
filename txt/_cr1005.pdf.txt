EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background and outlook
Over the past two years, Lesotho made significant progress in macro-economic performance
although implementation of structural reforms has been slow. Lesotho now faces significant
risks in the wake of the global financial crisis and economic downturn. Already, the Southern
African Customs Union (SACU) receipts, which account for a large part of government
revenue, have been revised down significantly; some textile factories have laid off workers
owing to reduced demand in the key U.S. market and difficulties securing lines of credit; and
one diamond mining company has already suspended operations amid a softening of
diamond prices.
With lower SACU revenues, the fiscal surplus is expected to narrow in 2009 and the current
account will register a deficit. Economic growth in 2009 is expected to fall below its recent
historical average, but should recover in 2010. However, a more protracted global and
regional downturn could postpone the timing and limit the size of the recovery.
Key policy issues
Given the downside risks to SACU revenues, the authorities agreed on the need to strengthen
collection of non-SACU revenues, maintain fiscal discipline and improve prioritization of
expenditures. They agreed to resuscitate the Project Appraisal Committee to strengthen the
process of selection and evaluation of capital projects. They also agreed to form a high-level
committee to fast-track implementation of structural reforms that should increase the growth
potential, facilitate economic diversity and improve competitiveness.
To contain risks from the weakly-supervised nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs), the
authorities agreed to amend the law on credit cooperatives and revise the Financial
Institutions Act (FIA). The government has also closed down the operations of the largest
Ponzi scheme and is awaiting a court decision to continue with its liquidation.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Lesotho is a small, highly open, landlocked country, with limited natural
resources, and a narrow production and export base. It has close economic ties with
South Africa and its currency, the loti, is pegged to the rand. Aside from subsistence
agriculture which employs a majority of the population, the garment sector, transfers from
the SACU,1 workers’ remittances and lately the diamond sector also play an important role in
employment, output, and exports (Figure 1). Lesotho is a member of the Common Monetary
Area (CMA)2 and the Southern African Development Community (SADC).

Economic growth has been erratic and social progress has been limited
(Figure 2). Growth in per capita income averaged about 1½ percent a year during the period
of 1997–2007, well below Lesotho’s regional and international comparators. Poverty has
declined modestly from 67 percent of households in 1994–95 to 57 percent in 2002–03, and
income distribution is highly unequal. In May of this year and in response to the high food
prices, the World Food Program began delivering food assistance to the population. It aims to
distribute food to 155,000 vulnerable people in Lesotho each year until 2010. The HIV/AIDS
epidemic continues to impact negatively on the economy, public service delivery and social
development and threatens the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
Already, the country’s ranking on the United Nations Human Development Index has
deteriorated, falling from the bottom 33 percent of all countries in the early 1990s to the
bottom 13 percent in 2007–08.

(equivalent to 6.7 months of
imports), the highest level in Lesotho’s history. Growth in broad monetary aggregates
remains high, reflecting the continued accumulation of net foreign assets. The prime lending
rate has increased in line with increases in South Africa.

As elsewhere, food and fuel prices have surged in Lesotho, driving the overall
inflation up from 6.4 percent at end-2006 to 11.8 percent at end-November 2008.
Lesotho has generally passed-through international fuel and food prices to retail prices, and
on April 1, 2008, tariffs for electricity, and public transportation were increased, in line with
higher international energy prices and the increase in the price of electricity imported from
South Africa. However, in order to boost food production, the 2008/09 budget provides

Financial sector (Box 1) vulnerabilities stem from the weakly supervised NBFIs,
and the emergence of Ponzi schemes. The largest Ponzi scheme (MKM), has been closed
but the final resolution of its identified liabilities remains an outstanding policy issue.3 On
September 23, 2008, the CBL provided to the public a summary of a confidential audit report
that indicated that the MKM group is insolvent, with identified assets falling short of
investors’ original contributions by M300 million (2.7 percent of GDP).4 There are so far no

discernible effects on financial intermediation from the collapse of the Ponzi scheme, but
many poor individuals have suffered financial losses.
Box 1. Lesotho’s Financial Sector
Lesotho’s financial system comprises three South African-majority controlled commercial
banks, with total assets equivalent to about 42 percent of GDP. NBFIs, with assets equivalent
to 21 percent of GDP, comprise money lenders, insurance companies, private pension funds,
unit trusts, and SACCOs. The state-owned Postal Bank provides bank-type services to the
unbanked population and micro, small, and medium enterprises, but it is not authorized to
make loans. Recently the government established a defined-contribution pension fund for
government employees aged 40 years or less.

III. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
7.
The global financial crisis has adversely affected Lesotho’s near-term prospects
(Box 2). Real GDP growth is projected to slow down from 5.1 percent in 2007 to 3.9 percent
and 2.1 percent in 2008 and 2009, respectively, owing to lower output in mining and textiles.
However, as the global economy recovers, growth is expected to increase to a range of
4–5 percent in the medium term. The external current account deficit is expected to widen
significantly to 8.5 percent of GDP in 2009 owing to reduced diamond and textile exports,
remittances, and SACU revenues but then narrow to 5 percent in 2013 in line with the global
recovery. Foreign direct investments are also anticipated to decline in 2009, resulting in an
overall balance of payments deficit and a reduction in international reserves to 6-7 months of
import cover. Balance of payments surpluses are projected beginning 2011, and international
reserves are expected to stabilize at about 5½ months of import cover in the medium term.

10
Box 2. Impact of the Global Financial Crisis and Downturn on Lesotho
Lesotho depends heavily on trade with South Africa and the United States that accounts for 69 percent
and 19 percent of its total trade, respectively. The main transmission channels of the crisis include:
SACU Revenues: Slower growth in South Africa’s economy reduces import demand, and thus customs
duty, excise taxes and the amount of revenues transferred to Lesotho. Following the recent downward
revision in South Africa’s growth prospects, the projected SACU common revenue pool (CRP) was
reduced by 6 percent in 2009, and by 15 percent in 2010–11. This has led to a significant revision of
Lesotho’s medium-term fiscal framework.
Textiles. With the slow-down in the U.S. economy, export volumes from Lesotho have declined. In
addition, as most of the garment factories are owned by firms in Asia, some of them are facing
difficulties obtaining trade credit for input financing from their Asian banks, which have been affected
by the global credit crunch.
Diamonds. Weak prices for diamonds and the global credit crunch have resulted in reduced production
and exports of diamonds. Already one mining company, Liqhobong, has suspended production and is
reassessing its operations, and another, Kao, which is just beginning production, is looking for potential
investors—a task that is difficult in the current environment.

Worker remittances. Remittances from migrant workers, mainly from South Africa, account for
about 20 percent of GDP. Already retrenchments in South Africa’s mining industry in response to the
global credit crunch may put over 9,000 jobs at risk, thus potentially affecting some 50,000 Basothos
who work in South Africa’s mines. A decline in remittances would reduce private consumption, lower
growth and increase poverty.

Considerable downside risks remain to the baseline outlook. Staff considered the
possible impact of a more protracted global financial crisis and economic downturn on
Lesotho’s economy by assuming a sustained reduction in the production of diamonds and
textiles (Figure 4).5 The results suggest a need for continuing vigilance on the macroeconomic front, and acceleration of structural reforms to ensure external sustainability.6
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
9.
Against the background of the global financial crisis, the discussions focused on
policies to:





achieve sustained, broad based growth for poverty reduction;
preserve fiscal sustainability and improve fiscal management;
pursue external stability; and
ensure financial stability and development.

5

The baseline scenario assumes a contraction in mining and textile sectors (of 6–6 ½ percent) followed by a
gradual recovery in 2010. The alternative scenario assumes a sustained reduction of 15 percent relative to the
baseline scenario.

The impact of lower SACU revenue is considered in the DSA.

Implementation of Previous Fund Policy Advice
Fund staff and authorities have generally agreed on Lesotho’s main economic
challenges. In the past, staff recommended containing recurrent expenditure in light of
uncertain SACU revenues, vigorously implementing structural reforms, and taking
prompt action to deal with the Ponzi schemes. The authorities’ containment of
recurrent spending contributed to a substantial surplus in 2007–08, and they closed
down the operations of the largest Ponzi scheme. However, the pace of structural
reforms has generally been slow mainly due to capacity constraints.
A. Achieving Sustained and Broad-Based Growth
10.
Staff and authorities agreed that accelerating broad-based sustainable economic
growth is needed to reduce poverty and inequality, and move toward achieving the
MDGs. The recent sharp declines, owing to drought and high cost of inputs, in agricultural
production—the source of income for the 70 percent of the rural population—may have
exacerbated poverty and worsened income distribution. Staff welcomed, therefore, the
government's intention to increase agriculture productivity with the support of the World

13
Bank, and to devise a long-term strategy to boost food production. Measures to address the
HIV/AIDS pandemic, such as awareness campaigns and increased anti-retroviral therapies,
are critical in supporting the development of human capital and increasing productivity in all
sectors.
11.
Staff welcomed the focus in the authorities’ draft Growth Strategy Paper (GSP)
of identifying binding constraints on growth and improving the investment climate. The
GSP rightly emphasizes the importance of prudent macro-fiscal policies, an improved
investment climate, enhanced property rights, land reforms, and better infrastructure as
linchpins for accelerating pro-poor growth. Staff and the authorities agreed, that for Lesotho
to become competitive, it will be critical to expedite the reforms being supported by the
World Bank and the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) in such areas as
(i) improving the legal, judicial, and regulatory reforms; (ii) raising productivity through
improvements in education and health; and (iii) enhancing access to financial services. Staff
also noted that Lesotho could take advantage of its proximity to South Africa by deepening
regional integration. The recent efforts to establish and operationalize the one-stop-shop are
welcomed but closer integration with the relevant ministries is also needed for greater
effectiveness.
12.
The implementation of projects supported by the MCC and the second phase of
Lesotho Highland Water Project (LHWP) should support growth over the next five to
ten years. The MCC approved a grant of US$362.6 million (22 percent of 2007 GDP) under
its compact program to assist Lesotho reduce poverty through sustained economic growth.
The grant, which came into force in September 2008, has to be utilized within the next five
years or Lesotho will lose the balance. The funds will be used to finance projects for
provision of water, renovation of health facilities, and development of the private sector. The
grant has an administration component for monitoring and evaluation, compact management,

The current land tenure system unduly constrains development of agriculture,
the financial sector, tourism, and manufacturing. Lack of collaterization of land and
clarification of land ownership rights weakens linkages between the agriculture and financial
sector while restrictions on foreign ownership and long-term leasing of land reduce
incentives for foreign investors to promote tourism and expand factory shells. While agreeing
that land reform is important, the authorities noted that progress is likely to be time
consuming as it requires consensus-building at the national level.
B. Preserving Fiscal Sustainability and Improving Fiscal Management
14.
The authorities agreed that Lesotho’s public finances are vulnerable to downside
risks to SACU revenues, which account for about two-thirds of its tax revenues.
Notwithstanding the recent downward revision in the CRP by South Africa, further reduction
cannot be ruled out in the event of (i) a potential change in the SACU revenue-sharing
formula; (ii) a further slow down in South Africa’s economic growth; (iii) a reduction in the
common external tariff rates due to trade liberalization; and (iv) the creation of a SADC
customs union in 2010, which may change Lesotho’s share of SACU revenues.
15.
Under unchanged policies and taking into account the authorities’ projection
for SACU revenues, the fiscal surplus will narrow from about 8½ percent of GDP
in 2008–09—against a budgeted deficit of 3 percent of GDP—to a surplus of 1.8 percent
of GDP in 2009–2010, but then rise as SACU revenues recover. The sharp increase in

Statistical discrepancy

Non-SACU fiscal balance

15
transfers in 2008–09 reflects full capitalization of the pension fund. In 2009-10 and beyond,
non-SACU revenues are assumed to grow in line with nominal GDP. On the expenditure
side, having already introduced a significant pension reform in the 2008–09 budget, which
recognized the contingent liability (4½ percent of GDP) associated with the existing
unfunded Defined Benefit Plan, the authorities do not intend to introduce any major
expenditure policy changes. The wage bill, which is already one of the highest in subSaharan Africa, is expected to decline gradually in line with the implementation of the Public
Sector Improvement and Reform Program (PSIRP). Over the medium term, the overall fiscal
position is projected to remain in surplus, consistent with a stable non-SACU deficit
(the overall fiscal balance excluding SACU revenues) of about 24–25 percent of GDP and a
substantial reduction in the domestic debt-to-GDP ratio.
16.
Looking ahead, the fiscal policy challenge will be to respond effectively to a
possible further deterioration in SACU revenues. To mitigate against that risk, the
government needs to strengthen non-SACU revenues and contain overall expenditures while
at the same time shifting the allocation of resources toward development outlays that support
growth. Implementation of these measures would permit a lower non-SACU deficit than
projected under the unchanged policy scenario. Staff urged the government to avoid a further
general wage increase and limit future recruitment to high priority areas. The authorities
agreed that the current wage policy may not be sustainable, and emphasized that full
implementation of the PSIRP remains a government priority.
17.
Staff noted the government’s intention to improve the public expenditure
management (PEM) system and resuscitate the Project Appraisal Committee (PAC) to
improve productivity of public investment. The staff and the authorities agreed that the
persistent underspending of the budget (10 percent of GDP in 2007/08) reflects primarily the
formulation of budget on the basis of the previous year’s budget appropriation rather than
outturn. To address this problem, the authorities agreed to formulate future budgets, starting
with the 2009/10 budget, on the basis of the expected outturn. They also intend to embark on
staff training in order to remove capacity bottlenecks and fast-track the implementation of the
new Integrated Financial Management Information System. A monitoring and reporting
framework will also be considered with a view to enhancing accountability in the use of
resources. The authorities are funding two investment projects under a Public-PrivatePartnership (PPP). They are aware of the risks and challenges of PPPs and are monitoring
their implementation in collaboration with the PAC. Staff urged that an appraisal framework
be put in place to vet new PPP projects and thereby avoid assuming excessive contingent
liabilities.
C. Pursuing External Stability
18.
Economic policies have been consistent with external stability. The staff agreed
with the authorities that the current exchange rate system should be maintained as it
facilitates capital and current transactions with the country’s most important economic

16
partner, South Africa. The main policy focus should be on fast-tracking the implementation
of key structural reforms in order to enhance productivity and competitiveness.
19.
The assessment of the level of the real exchange rate was based on three
approaches, the purchasing power parity approach adjusted for productivity
differentials, the external sustainability approach, and the macro balance approach.7
Based on information through September 2008, the approaches suggested an overvaluation in
the range of 5–11 percent. However, this has largely been offset since then by the
depreciation of the loti by 13 percent through end-2008. Caution should be exercised in
reaching a conclusion given weaknesses in data and the period of assessment. However,
Lesotho’s skewed trade pattern, with imports (mostly from South Africa) far exceeding
exports (mainly to the United States), complicates the interpretation and usefulness of the
standard real effective exchange rate for measuring competitiveness.

Lesotho scores poorly internationally and regionally on most measures of the
cost of doing business that are critical to enhancing its competitiveness. Already the
government has extended financial support to one large textile company to prevent layoffs
and other problems are emerging within the textile sector (Box 3). The current account
deficit will widen further to 8½ percent of GDP in 2009 from 3.7 percent of GDP in 2008;
and exports of textiles will fall throughout the projection period. Given Lesotho’s real
effective exchange rate is largely exogenous in light of the peg of the loti to the rand and with
inflation closely tracking that of South Africa, the sustainability of the current account
therefore depends crucially on pursuing competitiveness through rigorous implementation of
structural reforms.
7

These approaches and the key underlying assumptions are given in two 2007 IMF country reports on Lesotho
(Reports no.08/135 and no.08/136).

The authorities agreed that a continued build-up of international reserves
depends in large part on the pursuit of a prudent fiscal stance despite declining SACU
transfers. This is particularly important given the falling level of exports (textiles and
diamonds), and

With regard to external debt, the staff analysis shows that Lesotho’s public
and publicly guaranteed debt is sustainable, although there is a moderate risk of debt
distress (see the Debt Sustainability Analysis Annex). There is therefore a need to continue
pursuing prudent debt policies, including seeking loans on highly concessional terms.

Box 3. Challenges Facing the Textile Sector in Lesotho
Not since the expiration of the Multi Fiber Agreement on January 1, 2005 has there been so much
pressure on the textile sector in Lesotho. With about two-thirds of its exports going to the United
States, the industry has been hit hard by the recent downturn in the U.S. economy. Garment exports to
the United States during the first 10 months of 2008 are down by 15 percent compared with the same
period in 2007 and Lesotho’s share of the U.S. market has fallen.
Among the many other challenges facing the sector is the unavailability of credit from Asia and the
pending expiration of the third-country provision for sourcing inputs under the African Growth and
Opportunity Act (AGOA) by 2012. This is of particular importance considering that Lesotho has a
limited number of fabric mills and will have difficulty sourcing inputs from within the region. The sector
is also weighed down by high labor and shipping costs, a shortage of factory shells, and the lack of basic
infrastructure, such as water, communications and electricity services.

Responding to the challenges
Going forward, the challenge is to achieve international competitiveness in the face of strong
expansion of Asian exports to their traditional export market in the United States, especially after 2008,
when the bilateral agreements restricting Chinese exports expire. In spite of its relatively high unit labor
costs compared to those of the Asian textile producing countries and longer turn-around time, trade
preferences have helped Lesotho. However, there are no guarantees that the current benefits under the
AGOA will last beyond 2012. Moreover, possible reductions in most-favored-nation tariffs in industrial
countries under the current Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations, could further reduce the
preference margin for African exports, and adversely affect Lesotho’s garment sector. It is essential,
therefore, that key structural reforms be implemented quickly if Lesotho is to become competitive.

D. Ensuring Financial Stability and Development
23.
The banking sector seems to have weathered well the current global financial
crisis thus far. The three largely South-African-owned commercial banks continue to be
well capitalized, liquid and profitable. However, there has been a slight increase in
nonperforming loans, although these are still moderate and are fully provisioned. Some
vulnerability may remain as bank’s loan portfolios continue to be concentrated on a few
borrowers. Staff welcomed the approval by Parliament of the Anti-Money Laundering

19
legislation and urged that the necessary regulations be issued and the Financial Intelligence
Unit be put in place as quickly as possible.

(RUFIP) to increase access to financial
services, including by strengthening the
institutional and operational framework of PostBank. Implementation of these reforms
should deepen and enhance the efficiency of the financial sector.

20
The extent of the operation of the SACCOs, which by law are permitted to take
25.
deposits from nonmembers, is not well known, and the quality of regulatory oversight,
performed by the Ministry of Trade, is limited. The authorities intend to repeal Article 68
of the Cooperative Societies Act of 2000 that allows deposit mobilization from nonmembers
and may consider converting large SACCOs into commercial banks and placing them under
the supervision of the CBL. They are also reviewing the legislation on NBFIs under the
IFAD’s RUFIP, and more broadly, intend to further strengthen the CBL’s supervisory and
regulatory authority of the financial sector and prevent emergence of new Ponzi-type
schemes.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL

26.
After two years of good performance, Lesotho’s economy now faces significant
downside risks owing to the international financial crisis. Projections for SACU revenues
have been revised downward significantly and demand for Lesotho’s garments has fallen, as
has the price of diamonds. The authorities should therefore fast track structural reforms and
safeguard fiscal sustainability over the medium term.
27.
Broad-based growth will require prioritizing and implementing the reforms
supported by the World Bank and the MCC. The government’s growth diagnostic study
correctly recognizes a number of key constrains that hold growth in check, but it needs to
prioritize and remove the key cross-cutting constraints. Of particular importance is land
reform, which could help deepen the financial sector and serve as a catalyst for reinvigorating other sectors, such as tourism and manufacturing which are needed for
sustaining growth and poverty reduction.
Structural reforms need to be accelerated. Consolidating the recent growth
28.
performance also requires determined effort to fast-track the implementation of other reforms
to reduce the cost of doing business, improve the investment climate, and increase
investment in human and physical capital. Implementing these reforms should also help
diversify the economy, increase competitiveness and thereby help achieve external
sustainability. To ensure implementation and close monitoring, staff recommends charging a
high-level committee with the task of accelerating structural reforms, an approach that has
worked in other countries.
An appropriate fiscal policy strategy to mitigate risks from lower SACU
29.
revenues should be put in place. It could include: (i) strengthening non-SACU revenues;
(ii) containing recurrent spending by avoiding a general wage increase so as to create fiscal
space for increased public investment; (iii) improving the entire process of selecting,
monitoring, evaluating, and reporting progress on capital investment projects; (iv) making
the budget a more effective tool for public policy by formulating it on an outturn basis rather
than on unrealistic budget appropriations that do not advance transparency, accountability,
and effective use of scarce resources; and (v) accelerating the civil service reform component

21
of the PSIRP, including by linking wage increases to performance and to qualified
professionals within the health and education sectors.
30.
Staff commends the authorities on their recent decision to close the largest Ponzi
scheme and notes that an early successful resolution would serve the country well. It
would allow regulators to focus on their core task of ensuring an efficient functioning of the
formal financial sector that enhances access to finance and mobilizes resources for
productive investment.
Prompt action is needed to address vulnerabilities in NBFIs. The amendments to
31.
the FIA to strengthen the supervision and regulatory role of the CBL over NBFIs need to be
expedited. Staff therefore welcomes the intention to repeal Article 68 of the Cooperative
Societies Act of 2000 that allows deposit mobilization from nonmembers.

32.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

VII. Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the CBL was subject to a safeguards
assessment with respect to PRGF arrangement approved on March 09, 2001. The
assessment, completed on July 24, 2003, found that while the bank has made notable
progress in strengthening its safeguards since the off-site assessment in July 2001,
vulnerabilities remain, in particular in the areas of internal audit and internal controls.
VIII. Exchange arrangement:
Lesotho's currency, the loti (plural maloti), is pegged to the South African rand at par.
The CBL deals with commercial banks mainly in South African rand. As of
December 23, 2008, the rand (maloti) rate per U.S. dollar was M 9.74.

III. LESOTHO: STATISTICAL ISSUES
The statistical database is adequate for surveillance, although there are some
deficiencies in core surveillance data including national accounts balance of payments
statistics, and socio-economic data required to monitor progress toward the MDGs.
As one of 22 countries participating in the GDDS Project for Anglophone African Countries
(funded by the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID)), Lesotho has
undertaken the GDDS as framework for the development of its national statistical system.
GDDS metadata have been posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
since August 2003 and were last updated—except national accounts—in the last quarter
of 2007.
National accounts
Revised national accounts were released in November 2008 by the Bureau of Statistics
of Lesotho (BSL). Technical assistance from the EU and DFID supported the revision and
the rebasing of the GDP data from 1981 to 2007. Important new sources of data include the
use of VAT records and the 2002/03 household budget survey. Annual current and constant
price (2004) estimates of GDP by economic activity, expenditure and income data are
compiled by the BSL. These estimates have been published on the BSL’s web site from 1998
through 2007. Other macroeconomic indicators, such as industrial production indices, are
used to monitor developments during the year.
There is a need to improve and expand on the source data used for compiling national
accounts. Although access to data from the VAT records has proved valuable in revising the
national accounts, there is still a need for more detailed information on economic activities.
Therefore, the business register kept by the BSL should be overhauled and updated
accordingly.
Prices
Since November 2004, BSL produces a monthly consumer price index (CPI) that covers
Maseru and ten other urban centers. While the index has a reference period of
April 1997=100, the weights are still based on the 1994–95 HBS. In addition, a separate CPI
is compiled and published for Maseru City. The 2002–03 HBS is yet to be used to derive new
weights.
Government finance statistics
Data on government finance statistics are provided by the Ministry of Finance to AFR
Department periodically, although timeliness of reports remains problematic. Current
and capital expenditure would benefit from more disaggregated reporting, including for

8
health and education; revenues should be classified according to the GFSM 2001; and the
reporting lag for the functional breakdown of expenditure needs to be addressed. GFS should
distinguish clearly between current and capital (project) grants and external loan
disbursements.
A mission in 2004 assisted the authorities in implementing the reporting framework of
GFSM 2001. The mission identified several shortcomings in the data. Underreporting of
recurrent revenue and expenditure occurred as ministries net revenue against unreported
expenditure. Reporting of acquisition of nonfinancial assets was incomplete as ministries do
not fully report donor project outlays. These data were also insufficiently detailed to allow
appropriate economic classifications.
A subsequent mission in March 2006 found that progress with the implementation of
the previous missions’ recommendations had been impeded by lack of resources and
high turnover of staff. More specifically, no progress has been observed in implementing
the recommendation to expand the coverage of fiscal statistics to include extrabudgetary
units of government, or in aligning the classification of transactions in the source accounting
systems with GFSM 2001 classifications. A revision of the chart of accounts with the
introduction of the Integrated Financial Management Information System has led to
improvements in availability of source data.
A follow up mission in 2007 helped the authorities to improve both annual and high
frequency data for budgetary accounts. It also assisted with the analysis of local
government accounts and made recommendation on the inclusion of data on extra-budgetary
units in data for central government. However, the timeliness of data for these entities does
not match the timeliness of budgetary central government data. Therefore, recently
submitted 2005–06 data for publication in the Government Finance Statistical
Yearbook 2007 was limited to budgetary central government, with a commitment to submit
data on the other government units when these become available. No high frequency data are
reported for publication in the International Finance Statistics.
Monetary and financial statistics
Lesotho compiles monetary statistics based on the Standardized Report Forms, which
provide improved classification and sectorization of the accounts, and began reporting these
data to the Statistics Department (STA) in December 2004. Monthly data following this new
presentation are disseminated in the International Finance Statistics Supplement.
Despite the progress achieved, the authorities need, in line with STA recommendations, to
expand the institutional coverage of the other depository corporations sector and to value all
financial instruments at market value. A monetary and financial statistics mission in
September 2007 found that work had started on the inventory of all financial corporations
(deposit-taking and others), and that it was expected that credit cooperatives would be fully

9
covered in the other depository corporations survey in last quarter in 2008. The compilation
of the other financial corporations’ survey is targeted for the first quarter in 2009.
Balance of payments and external debt
The CBL compiles quarterly balance of payments statistics, usually with a lag of three
months. However, some timeliness issues remain in forwarding these data to the Fund.
A STA mission in mid-2002 found that the methodology underlying the compilation of the
balance of payments data suffers from the use of outdated benchmark surveys and
deterioration in the coverage and timeliness of some of data sources. The main
recommendations of the mission were as follows:


It is urgent to resolve both the inadequate coverage and the delayed reporting of
data on exports and imports of goods. The Department of Customs and Excise (DCE)
does not provide data in a timely fashion. The CBL, therefore, generates its own
estimates and there are significant differences between these estimates and DCE’s data.
For example, CBL believes that DCE is underreporting total imports and has been
adjusting the level of imports upward by 30 percent. There are also differences between
the trade data compiled by the CBL and the BSL.



Closer cooperation and new statistical surveys are needed to improve the quality of
data on exports and imports of services. Most of the data on exports of services are
based on outdated benchmark estimates adjusted for movements in the consumer price
index. Data available at the ministries and other organizations could also be of better use
for estimates of balance of payments variables. Government ministries and the CBL
should cooperate more and make better use of data sources in organizations like the
Lesotho Highlands Development Authority, the Lesotho National Development
Corporation, the South African Reserve Bank, and the Employment Bureau of South
Africa.

A STA mission in July–August 2008 made several recommendations. In general, the
authorities need to strengthen their institutional capacity. The CBL should be given formal
institutional responsibility for the compilation of balance of payments statistics. This work is
currently undertaken by the CBL but there is no legislation or official decree that designates
this responsibility. Together with other members of the Common Monetary Area, Lesotho’s
authorities also need to consider measures to harmonize concepts, methodology, and data
collection for regional balance of payments data.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
KINGDOM OF LESOTHO
Joint World Bank/IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association
Approved by Robert Sharer and Anthony Boote (IMF)
and Carlos A. Primo Braga and Sudhir Shetty (IDA)
January 23, 2009
This debt sustainability analysis (DSA) is based on end-2007 data for external and public
debt provided by the Lesotho authorities, and World Bank and IMF staff estimates for debt
outstanding to multilateral creditors. The overall staff assessment is that similar to last
year’s DSA, Lesotho is at a moderate risk of debt distress and remains vulnerable to adverse
shocks to the exchange rate, Southern African Customs Union (SACU) revenues and the
GDP growth rate, although debt appears manageable in a baseline scenario.
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This DSA has been prepared jointly by IMF and World Bank staff. It comprises
external and domestic debt, and is based on the framework for low-income countries
approved by the respective Executive Boards. The framework takes into account indicative
thresholds for debt burden indicators determined by the quality of the country’s policies and
institutions,1 and comprises baseline and alternative scenarios.
2.
Lesotho’s nominal public sector debt has shown a significant decline since 2002
falling from 92 percent of GDP to 43 percent of GDP (US$742.1 million) at the end
of 2007. Much of the decline is attributed to the authorities’ early repayment of non
concessional loans, limit on new borrowing, and a significant exchange rate appreciation
from 2003 to 2006. Of the total public sector debt, US$625.7 million was externally owed,
1

The World Bank Country Policy and Institutional Assessment has ranked Lesotho using the three-year moving
average as a “medium performer” in terms of policy and institutions with a rating of 3.5. The applicable
indicative thresholds for debt sustainability, proposed under the framework for low-income countries are:
(i) 40 percent for the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio, (ii) 150 percent for NPV of debt-to-exports ratio; (iii) 250 percent for the NPV of debt-to-fiscal revenues ratio; (iv) 20 percent for the debt service to exports ratio; and
(v) 30 percent for the debt service to revenue ratio.

2
with about 92 percent of the total (US$575.8 million) owed to multilateral creditors, mainly
IDA and the African Development Fund.2 Government also has domestic debt held by
residents in the amount of US$116.4 million. For private sector debt, only obligations toward
countries outside the Common Monetary Area are recorded. At end 2007, these obligations
were estimated at US$2.9 million.

3.
The global financial crisis and economic downturn will adversely affect
Lesotho’s economy. Lesotho’s economy is affected by economic developments in its major
trading partners, South Africa and the United States which account for 69 percent and
19 percent of its total trade, respectively. The main transmission channels include: (i) SACU
revenues: A slower growth in South Africa’s economy reduces import demand, hence,
customs duties and excise revenues (the major sources of SACU revenues); SACU revenues
have already been revised down by 6 percent of GDP in 2009; (ii) textiles: With the slowdown in the U.S. economy (Lesotho’s main export market for garments), exports from
Lesotho have declined by 15 percent during the first 10-months of 2008 and Lesotho has
been losing market share in the U.S. textile market. In addition, as most of the textile
2

The nominal public debt data does not include debt issued by the Lesotho Highlands Development Authority
(LHDA). Under the terms of the agreement with South Africa, the liabilities of the LHDA, which are equal to
about 10 percent of GDP, are not included since LHDA obtains financing to cover its debt service obligations
from South Africa.

3
factories in Lesotho are owned by firms in Asia, some of them are facing difficulties
obtaining trade credit for input financing from their Asian banks, which have been affected
by the global credit crunch; (iii) mining: weak prices for diamond and the global credit
crunch have already affected mining production and weakened prospects in the near term;
and (iv) worker remittances (20 percent of GDP)—mainly from South Africa—are likely to
decline amid the slowdown in South Africa’s mines which employ many Basothos.
4.
Overall, real GDP growth is projected to slow down from 5.1 percent in 2007 to
3.9 percent and 2.1 percent in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Much of the slowdown in
2009 is attributable to falling mining and textile production, which are each projected to fall
by 6 percent. However, as the global economy recovers, growth is expected to increase to a
range of 4–5 percent in the medium term.
II. ASSUMPTIONS
5.
The baseline scenario is premised on a number of macroeconomic projections
and reflects the global financial crisis and economic downturn in the near term (Box 1).
Compared to last year’s DSA, the 2008 DSA assumes a slightly lower rate of real GDP
growth and a current account that is projected to be in deficit. Real GDP growth is now
projected to average 4.1 percent up to 2013 with long-term growth remaining at 4.3 percent,
compared to average growth rates of 5.3 in the medium-term projected in the last DSA.
Sizable grants (US$362.5 million, equivalent to 22 percent of GDP) will be made available to
the government during the next five years under the Millennium Challenge Compact (MCC),
which will allow it to undertake significant capital investment in the development of the
country’s health infrastructure, water supply, and private sector development. In particular,
the construction of the Metolong dam is expected to increase the potential for the location of
“wet industries” such as fabric production, which would allow Lesotho to take fuller
advantage of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) beyond 2012. Overall, this
is expected to contribute around 1.5 percent to growth in the medium term. In addition, the
recent approval by South Africa of the second phase of the LHDA water project scheduled to
begin in 2012/13, will help in contributing to the slightly better medium-term growth
performance than has been observed in the past. However, the recent problems in the mining
and manufacturing sectors are expected to adversely affect growth and as such the
projections for this year’s DSA are somewhat lower than last year’s.
6.
The 2008 DSA assumes the current account will return to deficit as the level of
SACU transfers drop to a lower level and the textile and mining sectors come under
increasing pressure. After a few years of good performance the textile sector has begun to
experience a decline. In addition, diamond exports and revenue from the SACU are projected
to be lower and should adversely affect the current account in the medium term. Under the

4
Box 1. Main Assumptions Under the Baseline Scenario


Real GDP growth is assumed to be supported by the implementation of projects under the
MCC and the second phase of the LHDA water project. Growth should increase from
3.3 percent over the last ten years to about 4.1 percent in 2008–13 and then from 2014 to
stabilize at 4.3 percent.



Inflation (as measured by the implicit GDP deflator) is assumed to move from an average of
about 7½ percent over the last ten years to about 6 percent over the medium term and falling
to about 4 percent over the longer term. This is in line with anticipated inflation developments
in South Africa.



Despite lower SACU revenues, the overall fiscal balance is projected to be in surplus over the
medium term (5 percent of GDP) consistent with a stable non-SACU deficit of 24–25 percent
of GDP. Over the long term, the fiscal surplus is projected to narrow down to below 4 percent
of GDP, with revenues growing in line with nominal GDP and primary spending constant in
real terms.



Growth in exports of goods and services (in U.S. dollar terms) after averaging 14 percent over
the last 10 years is assumed to drop on average by 3 percent over the medium term before
recovering to about 8 percent in the long term. Import growth is assumed at about 2 percent
over the medium term before climbing to more than 8 percent in the longer term broadly in
line with GDP growth.



The current account balance (including official transfers) is determined by the above trends,
declining from a 12.7 percent of GDP surplus in 2007 to subsequent deficits as SACU
transfers, textile and diamond exports decline significantly. Net income is also assumed to
decrease gradually over the long term as remittances from South Africa continue to become
less important over time.



Net external public sector financing rises gradually, peaking at 3 percent of GDP by 2015 and
stabilizes at about 1½ percent of GDP over the long term. Foreign grants are assumed to
increase to about 5 percent of GDP over the medium term, reflecting the MCC compact, and
thereafter to decline to about 1½ percent of GDP. After 2012, it is assumed that borrowing
from IDA would be at hardened terms. It is further assumed that new non-IDA borrowing
would be contracted on highly concessional terms



Domestic debt is projected to fall in nominal terms gradually over time. Private sector debt is
projected to increase only marginally in terms of GDP, to 0.5 percent by 2028.

Atlas method, Lesotho’s GNI per capita stood at US$1,000 in 2007. Taking into account the
lags included in this methodology and the assumptions about growth, Lesotho would no
longer be able to borrow at standard IDA terms after 2010.3 In the baseline scenario, Lesotho
starts facing “IDA-hardened” terms after 2012 as a result of the growth in its GNI per capita.
3

In the DSA, IDA-hardened terms are incorporated and substituted for standard IDA terms after 2012, and
implies a charge of 0.75 percent, grace period of 10 years and a maturity period of 20 years (including the grace
period), compared to the 40-year maturity of standard IDA terms.

III. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
Baseline
7.
At end-2007, the NPV of external debt stood at 21.9 percent of GDP (Table 1a).
Under the baseline scenarios, Lesotho’s external debt indicators remain well below the
thresholds throughout the projection period. The PV of debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to
gradually decrease to 20 percent in 2018, below the policy-based indicative threshold
(40 percent); and the PV of debt-to-export ratio would rise to 64 percent by 2018, although it
would still be significantly below the 150 percent threshold. The highly concessional nature
of the existing debt and new borrowing contributes to debt service ratios below the indicative
threshold throughout the projection period. The government undertook to repay early a
significant amount of non concessional debt resulting in lower scheduled interest payments
and hence a declining effective interest on debt. Borrowing, however, is expected to still be
on broadly concessional terms.4
Alternative scenarios and stress tests
8.
Sensitivity tests show that while Lesotho’s debt burden would worsen in the
event of an adverse macroeconomic shock or weaker economic performance compared
to historical outcomes, it would remain below the indicative thresholds in most cases
(Table 1b and Figure 1). Real GDP growth in the 10-year period up to 2007 averaged
3.3 percent, less than that assumed in the projection period. The noninterest current account
was also significantly weaker than that projected under the baseline scenario due to the lower
level of SACU transfers. As a result, the evolution of debt would be adversely affected
should the key macroeconomic variables during the projection period revert to their pre-2007
levels. Debt indicators in the historical scenario (scenario A1) tend to be more elevated than
4

The depreciation of the loti had a significant effect on the debt-to-GDP ratio in 2008.

6
under the baseline scenario, with some indicators (PV of debt to GDP and PV of debt to
exports) crossing the debt thresholds by 2020, underscoring the need to become more
competitive, boost export receipts and grow at a faster rate.
9.
A shock to SACU transfers could be sizable. In October 2008, SACU revenue
projection for Lesotho was revised down by about 6 percent of GDP relative to the previous
projection for 2009/10. The baseline scenario already incorporates this downward revision.
The sensitivity scenario of reducing SACU transfers thus assumes a permanent decline of the
same magnitude (6 percent of GDP) relative to the baseline for the entire projection period
starting in 2009. The same sensitivity exercise is also conducted for public debt DSA; see
below. SACU transfers represent more than 50 percent of export receipts. When SACU
transfers are reduced permanently relative to the baseline by about 6 percent of GDP, (Table
1b; scenario A3), all debt indicators worsen. More importantly, two debt indicators (PV of
debt to GDP and PV of debt to exports) cross their thresholds as early as 2014 and 2016,
respectively, underscoring the importance of these transfers to sustainability of the current
account.
10.
The bound tests reveal that Lesotho would face the most distress if there were to
be a much lower level of non debt creating flows (scenario B1). Under this scenario, the
PV of debt-to-GDP ratio first increases to 40 percent of GDP in 2010 before falling to
33 percent of GDP in 2018. There are also underlying vulnerabilities with respect to the
combined impact of lower GDP, export growth and nondebt creating flows. Such a shock
would lead to higher PV of debt-to-GDP and PV of debt-to- exports ratios compared to the
baseline scenario.
IV. PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
Baseline
11.
At end-2007 domestic debt contributed only marginally to the baseline scenarios
for Lesotho’s public debt ratios (Table 2a). Lesotho has a low level of domestic debt, and
so public debt indicators are very closely aligned to those of public external debt. Domestic
debt, which was at 6.7 percent of GDP at the end of 2007, is expected to be gradually
reduced by 2018 to 3 percent of GDP. Domestic debt has been issued by government mostly
to provide an impetus to the formation of a money market. The proceeds from the sale of Tbills are held in deposits at the Central Bank of Lesotho; therefore these bills have not
represented additions to net debt.
12.
The trajectory of gross debt understates somewhat the decline in Lesotho’s net
indebtedness especially in the next few years. This trajectory takes into account the
disbursement of loans in the pipeline even in periods when fiscal surpluses would permit a
net reduction of debt. It is also assumed that the authorities will stick to the original schedule
for the repayment of the highly concessional debt. This implies that the public sector will

7
accumulate some assets over the medium term, as indicated by large residuals in tables 1a
and 2a. Alternatively, the analysis could be assumed to show that there is margin for lower
primary surpluses that would remain consistent with the reduction in gross debt shown in
Figure 2. However, because of limited implementation capacity, the authorities are not
expected to significantly increase their level of capital investment making it more likely that
they will accumulate assets rather than significantly increase their investment levels.
Alternative scenarios and stress tests
13.
In the standard sensitivity tests public sector debt to GDP ratios will deteriorate
(Table 2b and Figure 2). The indicators are most sensitive to a permanent decline in SACU
revenues and deviations from the baseline growth path. In the scenario with variables at
historical averages, ratios initially rise but eventually decline. The most extreme shock is
linked to a permanent decline in SACU revenues further reinforcing the need to guard fiscal
sustainability.
14.
A permanent adverse shock to SACU revenues could lead to a rising public debt
profile. A shock of the same magnitude as in the external DSA (sustained reduction in
SACU revenue) would increase the PV of public debt to GDP ratio from 31 percent in 2009
to 40 percent in 2013, a sizable increase over only five years. By 2028, the ratio would stand
at 68 percent, twice the ratio in 2008.
V. CONCLUSION
15.
Lesotho faces a moderate risk of debt distress although in the baseline scenario
key debt ratios are below the indicative thresholds for a country with Lesotho’s
performance rating. The risk would materialize if key variables such as economic growth
and the current account deficit were to revert to their historical levels or if Lesotho were to
face a sizable adverse shock to SACU revenues. These results therefore underscore the need
for the authorities to enhance non-SACU revenues, contain overall spending, ensure adequate
levels of reserves, and accelerate growth, through increased competitiveness while
continuing to seek grants and highly concessional loans.

Source: Staff projections and simulations.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt
creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline, while grace and maturity periods are the same
as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline
level after the shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

1/ Assumes that real GDP growth is at baseline minus one standard deviation divided by the length of the projection period.
2/ In October 2008, SACU revenue projection was revised down by about 6 percent of GDP which is incorporated in the baseline scenario.
The alternative scenario assumes a permanent decline of the same magnitude relative to the baseline for the entire projection period
starting in 2009.
3/ Revenues are defined inclusive of grants.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation
with the Kingdom of Lesotho
On February 9, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Kingdom of Lesotho.1
Background
Lesotho has made significant progress in macroeconomic performance but the pace of
implementation of key structural reforms has been slow. After a decade of low growth,
economic activity surged above historic trends, averaging 6.6 percent during 2006-07 driven by
the mining, textile and construction sectors. However, poverty has seen only a modest decline,
and the HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to impact negatively on the economy, public service
delivery and social development, and threatens the achievement of the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs).
Large transfers from the Southern African Customs Union (SACU), together with workers’
remittances and exports of textiles and diamonds, contributed to a sizable build-up of
international reserves equivalent to 6.7 months of imports at end-2007. Inflation has surged
from 6.4 percent at end-2006 to 11.8 percent at end-November 2008 owing mainly to the rise in
food and fuel prices. Growth in broad monetary aggregates remains high, reflecting the
continued accumulation of net foreign assets.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
In 2007/08, Lesotho recorded its fifth consecutive fiscal surplus reflecting buoyant SACU
receipts, increases in value-added and income taxes as well as underspending of both recurrent
and development expenditure. Debt indicators have also improved as the use of SACU receipts
to retire nonconcessional debt contributed to a decline in the ratio of external debt-to-GDP to 36
percent at the end of 2007 from 85.5 percent in 2002.
Financial sector vulnerabilities stem from the weakly supervised nonbank financial institutions
and the potential re-emergence of Ponzi schemes. The banking sector thus far appears not to
have been seriously affected by the current global financial crisis.
The medium term economic outlook is somewhat clouded in the wake of the global financial
crisis and economic downturn. Downside risks remain from a potential further decline in SACU
revenues, and lower exports of textiles and minerals should the global economic downturn be
protracted.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their prudent macroeconomic management,
which has contributed to the recent strong economic performance and a continued build-up of
international reserves. Directors noted, however, that Lesotho continues to face the challenges
of sustaining economic growth, tackling widespread poverty and the high incidence of
HIV/AIDS, and achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Addressing these challenges has
been further complicated by the on-going global economic and financial crisis, which could
result in a reduction in Southern African Customs Union (SACU) revenues, remittances, and
exports of textiles and minerals.
Against this background, Directors emphasized the need for continued vigilance on the
macroeconomic front, with a view to preserving fiscal and external stability. They also
considered it crucial to fast-track the implementation of structural reforms, aimed particularly at
promoting broad-based growth. In this regard, Directors welcomed the authorities’ growth
diagnostic study, which would guide the prioritization of efforts to remove constraints to growth.
They stressed in particular the importance of land reform, which has the potential to reinvigorate
the financial, tourism, and manufacturing sectors, critical for employment creation and sustained
poverty reduction.
Directors called on the authorities to accelerate the pace of reforms, supported by the World
Bank and the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC). Determined efforts to reduce the cost
of doing business, improve the investment climate, and increase investment in human and
physical capital would help consolidate the recent gains in growth performance and improve
competitiveness. Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to set up a high-level committee
that will ensure rapid implementation of these reforms.
Directors encouraged the authorities to adopt a fiscal strategy to mitigate risks from potentially
lower SACU revenues, while creating fiscal space for increased social spending and growthenhancing investment. This includes strengthening non-SACU revenues and tax administration,

3
and containing recurrent spending. Directors also saw the need to accelerate civil service
reform and to contain the wage bill, including by linking future increases to performance and to
qualified professionals within the health and education sectors.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to improve the process of public expenditure
management. They supported the plan to formulate future budgets on the basis of the expected
outturn, noting that this would make the budget a more effective tool for public policy, while
improving transparency, accountability, and effective use of resources. Directors also
underscored the importance of prudent debt policy, including seeking loans on highly
concessional terms.
Directors agreed that Lesotho’s monetary and exchange rate regime under the Common
Monetary Area helps maintain price stability and facilitates capital and current transactions with
the country’s most important economic partner, South Africa. They emphasized, however, that
maintaining external sustainability will require enhanced productivity and competitiveness, and
pursuit of a prudent fiscal policy.
Directors noted that, while the banking sector has weathered the global financial crisis relatively
well, more needs to be done to improve regulatory oversight and increase access to financial
services for small- and medium-scale enterprises and the underserved population. In this
regard, they welcomed the efforts underway, supported by the MCC and the International Fund
for Agricultural Development, to deepen and enhance efficiency of the financial sector.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ recent decision to close the largest Ponzi scheme, and
looked forward to an early resolution. They urged that prompt action be taken to address
vulnerabilities arising from the weakly supervised nonbank financial institutions, including by
expeditiously amending the Financial Institution Act to strengthen the supervision and regulatory
role of the central bank. Directors also supported the planned amendment of the Cooperative
Societies Act, which would prohibit deposit mobilization from nonmembers of credit
cooperatives. They welcomed the passage of the Anti-Money Laundering Law, and looked
forward to the establishment of the Financial Intelligence Unit.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

February 9, 2009

1.

Introduction

On behalf of the Lesotho authorities, I would like to thank staff for the candid and productive
discussions during the Article IV mission, and the Executive Board and Management for their
continued support. The authorities value the advice proffered by the Fund and are in general
agreement with the thrust of the reports.
Lesotho has made significant progress in achieving macroeconomic stability over the years.
However, Lesotho remains susceptible to external shocks. Growth has been supported by the
manufacturing and diamond mining sectors. Prudent use of fiscal surpluses to reduce public
debt and build up reserves has enhanced fiscal and external stability. While the current global
financial crisis has thus far had limited impact on Lesotho’s banking system, the economy has
been affected indirectly through reduced demand for exports, tightened trade credit for the
textile industry which has links with Asian financial markets and significantly reduced
investment flows for the diamond mining sector.
The authorities remain committed to the implementation of prudent policies to preserve
macroeconomic stability and promote sustainable growth.
2.

Recent Economic Developments and Macroeconomic Outlook

Lesotho’s economic growth is estimated to have slowed down to 5.1 percent in 2007, from
7.2 percent in 2006, mainly due to a decline in agricultural output as a result of adverse
weather conditions. Growth was largely supported by increased production in the mining and
manufacturing sectors. The mining sector benefited from additional investment and efficiency
gains in diamond mining as well as the favorable outlook on the international prices of
precious stones. The manufacturing sector’s contribution emanated mainly from textiles and
clothing exports, which were mostly destined to the US. Inflation continued to rise throughout
most of the last year, mainly as a result of high fuel and food prices and it reached 12 percent
per annum in September 2008. However, it declined to 10.6 percent in December, as the
international oil and food prices abated.
Fiscal performance remained strong in 2007/08, with government budgetary operations
recording a surplus for the fifth consecutive year. The surplus, estimated at around 10 percent
of GDP, was supported by the increased SACU and domestic tax revenues as well as lower
expenditures. Surpluses continued to be realized during the first half of 2008/09 fiscal year.
The external position also improved, resulting in the accumulation of foreign reserves to about
7 months of import cover by the end of 2007. The improvement in the balance of payments
position largely reflected increased SACU receipts as well as a rise in foreign direct
investment in manufacturing and mining industries.

2
Medium term economic prospects seem to be mixed. Growth is expected to benefit from the
recovery of the agricultural sector and increased construction activity due to commencement
of new public infrastructure projects. Investment projects to be implemented under the
Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) compact and implementation of Phase II of the
Lesotho Highlands Water Project are expected to contribute significantly to growth. Prudent
macroeconomic policies are expected to continue to support macroeconomic stability.
Downside risks include the negative impact of unfavorable developments in the external
environment and the persistent drought on agriculture. The manufacturing sector is expected to
be adversely affected by the reduction in demand in the US economy, as the recession
intensifies and credit conditions tighten in Asia, where most of the firms source their
financing, while the diamond mining sector could be adversely affected by the falling
international prices of rough diamonds. Developments in the global regime for textiles, such as
the erosion of trade preferences, would also add strain to Lesotho’s export sector. Inflationary
pressures are expected to continue to follow developments in international oil and food prices.
The slowdown in the South African economy is also expected to have negative fiscal and
external effects on Lesotho’s economy through declining SACU revenues and export demand.
The authorities are, however taking necessary measures to help address these challenges.
Government is looking at long term measures such as irrigation to mitigate the problem of
persistent droughts.
3.

Policies

Fiscal Policy
The authorities remain committed to prudent macroeconomic management and consolidation
of macroeconomic stability that has been achieved over the last years. Prudent fiscal policy
will continue to be the main tool for macroeconomic management and will be aimed at
ensuring sustainable fiscal and external stability. Debt sustainability and external stability has
improved significantly over the years, as government used the fiscal surpluses to reduce nonconcessional public debt.
Going forward, SACU revenues are expected to decline as a result of the reduction in the
common revenue pool cause by the slowdown in the South African economy and the effects of
trade liberalization on customs revenues. This poses a significant challenge to fiscal policy
given that SACU revenues constitute the bulk of government revenues. In this regard, the
authorities will continue their efforts to bolster domestic revenue collections mainly through
measures to improve revenue administration. Some expenditure restraint, consistent with the
projected fall in SACU revenues while at the same time providing for the infrastructure and
social needs of the country, will also be exercised. Fiscal surpluses are expected to continue to
be realized, albeit at narrower levels, in the medium term.

3
Significant progress is being made in strengthening public financial management (PFM). PFM
reforms which were initiated in 2005 include the review of procurement regulations,
introduction of the medium term expenditure framework (MTEF) and the introduction of the
Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS). Implementation of the new
procurement regulations began in 2007 and the process of implementing IFMIS is at an
advanced stage. The IFMIS system is already in place and will start operating during the
coming budget year (2009/10). The IFMIS is expected to enhance all the accounting aspects of
the budget process, including commitment control and generation of reports for budget
monitoring.
The authorities are also putting measures in place to improve budgeting in order to improve
the effectiveness of the budget as an instrument to achieve the national development objectives
and to enhance the efficiency of resource allocation among ministries. In this connection the
MTEF, which had been introduced on a pilot basis, has now been rolled out to all government
ministries and its functionality is now being expanded. New Public Financial Management and
Accountability and Audit bills have been drafted to underpin the PFM reforms and are
currently undergoing review.
Public service effectiveness will be addressed under the Public Sector Improvement and
Reform Program (PSIRP), which is undergoing some design. It is intended to cover civil
service reform and decentralization of public services.
Lesotho’s public and publicly guaranteed debt is sustainable, although there is a moderate risk
of debt distress. To safeguard debt sustainability, the authorities will continue to reduce the
amount of commercial debt outstanding and to the extent possible, limit borrowing to
concessional terms.
Monetary Policy and Financial Sector Issues
Lesotho’s CMA membership, which provides for the loti to be pegged at par to the rand and
for free movement of capital within the CMA, has supported price stability. Monetary policy
in Lesotho continues to be aimed at maintaining a strong external reserve position to support
the exchange rate parity with the South African rand as well as to meet the country’s external
obligations. This has been supported by prudent fiscal policies.
The current global financial crisis has thus far had limited impact on Lesotho’s banking
system. The banking sector remains strong, with banks being profitable, well-capitalized, and
liquid with relatively moderate and well provisioned non-performing loans (NPLs). Downside
risks posed by the relatively high concentration of the banks’ portfolios on a few borrowers are
mitigated by the full collateralization of most of the loans to the top twenty borrowers.
Financial intermediation has continued to be limited as banks remain risk averse and as a
result access to financial services is lacking for the bulk of the population. The authorities are
making efforts to increase access to financial services, with the support of the MCC and under

4
the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) rural financial intermediation
program (RUFIP). These include the strengthening of the institutional and operational
framework of the Lesotho Postbank, and the development of the microfinance sector. The
improvement of financial intermediation would also be facilitated by the creation of the credit
reference bureau, development of a national identity system, an Automatic Clearing House and
modernization of the commercial court. The ongoing review of legislation for the non-bank
financial institutions (NBFIs), under RUFIP, is expected to usher a sound regulatory
framework for NBFIs, which pose a challenge to the ability of the authorities to supervise and
regulate as they are not covered by the current financial institutions laws.
The new Anti-Money Laundering legislation has been approved by Parliament and
preparations are underway to develop regulations and to establish a Financial Intelligence
Unit.
Growth Policies
The Government’s key priority remains that of promoting sustainable economic growth to
reduce poverty and move towards achieving the MDGs. The authorities have developed a draft
Growth Strategy Paper (GSP), which identifies opportunities and binding constraints on
growth. Going forward, the authorities plan to devote significant resources in the medium term
fiscal framework and the annual budgets, as well as the Government’s reform initiatives with
the priorities identified in the GSP.
To address the constraints on growth, the authorities are, with the support of the World Bank
and the MCC, undertaking reforms to improve the investment climate and international
competitiveness. Effective implementation of the MCC’s private sector development
component and the World Bank’s ongoing Private Sector Competitiveness and Economic
Diversification Program would help reduce the cost of doing business in Lesotho. These
would include addressing the legal and regulatory constraints, improving private sector access
to credit and piloting economic diversification initiatives in tourism and agribusiness.
A trade and investment facilitation centre has already been established to serve as a one stop
shop for potential investors and to reduce regulatory impediments and facilitate investment. A
modernized Companies Bill is under preparation to support these business reforms.
4.

Conclusion

In conclusion, I wish to reaffirm the authorities’ commitment to the prudent macroeconomic
management which has facilitated the achievement of macroeconomic stability. Promotion of
growth and poverty reduction also remain high in their policy agenda. They are confident that,
with the continued support of the Fund and the international community, they will make
meaningful progress toward achieving their developmental goals.
