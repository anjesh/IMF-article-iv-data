CHILE
Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the
2004 Consultation with Chile
Approved by José Fajgenbaum and Juha Kähkönen
July 12, 2004
• Discussions. A staff team held discussions in Santiago during May 17–28. The team met with
the Minister of Finance; the Minister of Economy and Energy; the Minister of Planning and
Cooperation; the President of the Central Bank; other senior officials; and representatives of the
private sector and the academic community.
• Team. The staff team comprised G. Terrier (Head), M. Espinosa, C. Faulkner-MacDonagh,
R. Luzio (all WHD), and J. Chan-Lau (ICM). A. Ize (MFD) joined the mission on May 19–20 to
discuss the results of the FSAP findings and recommendations, and F. Nadal de Simone (EUR)
on May 24 to discuss inflation targeting issues. M. Vera Martin (ICM) contributed to the work
on international reserves. A. Singh (WHD) took part in the concluding discussions. Mr. Le Fort,
the Executive Director for Chile, attended the key meetings.
• Previous consultation. At the conclusion of the 2003 Article IV consultation, on August 18, 2003,
Directors commended the Chilean authorities for implementing a sound policy framework, based
on inflation targeting, exchange rate flexibility, and a prudent target for the structural fiscal
balance. They considered that these policies, in conjunction with other strong fundamentals, such
as transparent institutions, an open trade regime, and sound banking and financial regulatory
systems, have allowed Chile continued stability and economic growth. Directors emphasized the
importance of enhancing progress in addressing constraints to growth and employment through
regulatory, capital market, and social sector reform, including those in the Pro-Growth Agenda
reform. Directors also urged the authorities to enhance labor market flexibility, including by
moving ahead on their commitment to make work schedules more flexible (the staff report was
published as IMF Country Report No. 03/303).
• Relations with the Fund. Chile has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, sections 2, 3, and 4
and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions. Chile participates in the New Arrangements to
Borrow and subscribes to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard. A fiscal ROSC was
published in August 2003, and an FSSA report accompanies this staff report.
• Selected Issues Papers. Background papers for the Article IV consultation include: (i) an analysis
of Chile’s holdings of international reserves; (ii) an assessment of the use of forward hedging in
the economy; (iii) an analysis of indexed peso-denominated bond issues; and (iv) recent trends in
potential output.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Economic outlook
•

Economic activity is picking up and real GDP is projected to grow by about
5 percent a year in 2004 and 2005. Private investment is gradually increasing, but
unemployment remains relatively high, at about 9 percent in May. Reflecting the
recovery in world demand, copper prices remain high, and the external current
account is projected to register a surplus of 1 percent of GDP in 2004.

•

Inflation fell below the target band in early 2004, but it is expected to return within
the 2–4 percent band by year-end. The sharp appreciation of the peso during the
second half of 2003 helps explain the decline in inflation in the early part of this year.
However, inflation expectations are well anchored, and 12–month inflation is
projected at about 2 percent by end–2004.

•

The risks of disruption of natural gas imports from Argentina appear manageable.
The authorities are taking steps to promote a gradual shift from gas to other sources
of electricity generation.

Policy discussions
•

The government is firmly committed to the structural fiscal balance rule. Full
adherence to the rule is a challenge this year, given calls to increase spending in the
context of high copper prices. So far, the government has successfully resisted such
pressure and has also prudently used most of the surpluses accumulated by the
Copper Stabilization Fund in recent months to repay expensive debt.

•

Staff shared the authorities’ view that monetary policy can continue to support
domestic demand for some time, particularly given the output gap. The authorities
reaffirmed their commitment to tighten policies when their estimates show that, on a
sustained basis, inflation would move above the mid-range of the target band.

•

As highlighted in the companion Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA)
report, the Chilean financial system is strong, with room for greater competition.
The authorities have indicated that they plan to follow up on FSAP recommendations.

•

With Presidential and congressional elections in late 2005, attention is turning to
the agenda to sustain high economic growth. This is leading to a rich public debate
on education reform, labor productivity, and income distribution.

-5-

I. ECONOMIC BACKGROUND
1.
Over the past two decades, Chile has adhered to a sound and consistent policy
framework. The focus has been on prudent macroeconomic policies and open trade and, in
recent years, inflation targeting and achievement of a structural surplus in the accounts of the
central government. In the area of monetary policy, the authorities have been successfully
implementing inflation targeting, and 12–month inflation has been reduced from about
8 percent in the mid–1990s to 1 percent during 2003. The authorities have allowed the
exchange rate to fluctuate freely since end–2001. In the fiscal area, the authorities have
strictly contained central government spending and adhered closely to the fiscal rule,
introduced by the current administration in 2000.
2.
These policies have been successful at fostering growth and macroeconomic
stability. Over 1980–2003, Chile was able to narrow the relative income gap with advanced
economies (per capita income rose from about 20 percent of the U.S. per capita income in the
early 1980s to close to 30 percent in 2002). During this period, Chile was the fastest growing
country in Latin America, with average annual per capita income growth of 3¼ percent.
Although this performance fell significantly short of that in Asia (5¼ percent), it was well
above the average for Latin America (½ percent). Chile’s GDP per capita growth slowed to
1¼ percent during 1998–2003, but this still compared favorably with Latin America as a
whole, which registered a slight decline.
3.
Chile’s future challenge is to return to a path of strong growth while ensuring that
its benefits are shared more equitably. Despite a sharp reduction in poverty, the recent
slowdown in growth has further impeded progress in addressing income inequality.
According to a recent World Bank report on Latin America, Chile’s income inequality is
high—second only to Brazil.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Economic activity has picked up
since the beginning of 2004, in the context
of a very favorable external environment.
The recovery in the global economy,
including the strength of economic activity
in China, has helped boost export prices and
demand, particularly for copper—Chile’s
main export commodity, the price of which
has surged (Figure 1 and Box 1).1

Copper accounts for 10 percent of Chile’s GDP and about 40 percent of its exports of goods. The
price of copper surged from US$0.72 a pound in December 2002 to US$1.30–1.40 a pound in
March-April 2004 (in early July, copper prices stood at about US$1.25 a pound).

-6-

Chile has also benefited from low world interest rates, and—following ratings upgrades—
sovereign spreads have hovered at about 90 basis points, well below the regional average of
just over 600 basis points. Reflecting, in part, these developments, real GDP grew by
6½ percent (q/q, seasonally adjusted) during the first quarter, the strongest quarterly growth
in three years.
Box 1. Chile’s Trade Links With China
Chile’s trade with China has experienced remarkable growth in recent years. During 1998-2003, Chile’s
exports to, and imports from, China grew by 41 percent and 13 percent a year, respectively. In 2003,
China absorbed 9 percent of Chile’s exports—copper represented 70 percent of the total, reflecting
China’s strong demand for base metals.
China is the world’s largest consumer of copper. China’s copper demand is equivalent to 20 percent of
total world demand, with Chile supplying about half of its external copper needs. China’s copper demand
has grown by over 15 percent a year since 1998, and it accounted for 120 percent of the global demand
increase in 2003. The strong growth in fixed investment (28 percent in 2003) has been the main cause for
China’s demand for base metals. With almost half of copper demand going to electricity generation
equipment, China’s efforts to boost electricity supply would suggest that its copper imports will remain
strong in the coming years, and it is expected to remain a major importer of copper in the period ahead.1
World inventories are at low levels, and copper prices are expected to remain above current production
costs for some time.
Chile is well positioned to benefit from growing trade links with China. In 2003, Chile had a trade surplus
with China of over 1 percent of GDP. The two countries’ comparative trade advantages are complementary,
as reflected in the current composition of trade flows. Chinese exports are concentrated mostly in consumer
goods, which accounted for 25 percent of Chile’s imports of consumer goods. Chilean exports are focused
on raw commodities and commodity-based industrial goods. The authorities are conducting a feasibility
study for a wide-ranging trade agreement, expected to be completed by the fall of 2004.

Some analysts expect world demand to outstrip supply by about 450 million of tons in 2004, bringing inventory levels below four
week’s worth of consumption, a level considered as the minimum operational inventory level for the industry.

5.
Regional developments—especially Argentina’s decision to cut natural gas
exports—are, however, weighing on activity. Recent positive economic developments have
been overshadowed, in part, by Argentina’s decision to reduce its natural gas exports to
Chile. This is forcing domestic electricity generation to switch from relatively cheap natural
gas to more costly coal- and diesel-generated power. At the same time, increases in
petroleum import prices have raised costs further and dampened disposable income growth.
6.
Growth has remained concentrated in selected sectors, dampening job growth. The
economic rebound, to date, has been mostly in financial services, manufacturing, and retail
trade. As a result, despite steady, albeit modest, job gains in personal and financial services,
the unemployment rate remains at about 9 percent (Table, inset) and the negative output gap
at 3¾ percent. Over the 12–month period ending in April 2004, the increase in nominal
wages in the private sector was 3 percent.

Consumer spending has driven most of the recent pick up in activity. Consumption
growth (proxied by real consumer goods imports) grew sharply in the first half of 2003, but
paused in the second half. In more recent

Reflecting in part a sharp
appreciation of the peso, 12–month
inflation temporarily fell below the
inflation target range. The strong
improvement in copper prices contributed to
a sharp appreciation of the peso against the
U.S. dollar beginning in mid–2003.2 In turn,
the appreciation of the peso, together with
the persistent output gap, led to downward
pressure on domestic prices (Figure 4). In
late 2003 and early 2004, twelve-month CPI
inflation fell below the 2–4 percent central
bank’s inflation target range (Figure 5).
Since February 2004, the peso has
weakened somewhat against the U.S. dollar,
and 12–month inflation has returned to a
positive range–at 1 percent in June.
9.
In response to downward pressure
on prices, the central bank lowered its
policy rate in late 2003 and early 2004.
During most of 2003, the central bank kept
its monetary policy rate unchanged at
2¾ percent. However, following a sharp
drop in expected inflation,3 the central bank
cut its rate twice, by 50 basis points on each
occasion, in December 2003 and
January 2004. Since then, the rate has
remained unchanged, well below most
estimates of the neutral rate (Figure 6).
10.
Fiscal policy has remained prudent.
In 2000, the government introduced the
fiscal structural balance rule—requiring the
central government to maintain a cyclicallyadjusted surplus of 1 percent of GDP.
Under the government’s rule, noncopper
revenue is adjusted over the business cycle

During the second half of 2003, Chile’s real effective exchange rate rose by close to 15 percent,
before retreating by around 5 percent in the first five months of 2004.

Expected inflation is calculated by taking the difference between the yields on the five-year nominal
(BCP5) and five-year inflation-indexed (BCU5) central bank bonds, and through surveys of market
analysts’ expectations of future inflation.

using an estimate of trend output, and
copper revenue is smoothed out by
assuming that revenue above (or below) a
reference price is cyclical. Under this rule,
which allows the government to effectively
implement counter-cyclical policies, the
actual deficit of the central government was
reduced from 1¼ percent of GDP in 2002 to
½ percent in 2003, primarily reflecting
expenditure restraint (Tables 1 and 2).

External conditions remain favorable, and vulnerability indicators have improved
(Table, inset). In 2003, Chile’s terms of trade improved by 4¾ percent, reflecting in part the
surge in copper prices, and the external current account deficit narrowed by ½ percentage
points, to ¾ percent of GDP. International reserves remain high—at about seven months of
goods and services imports and nearly 20 percent of GDP—and comfortably exceed the
stock of short-term external debt. The appreciation of the peso has also contributed to a
significant reduction in the external debt-to-GDP ratio, although external corporate debt
remains high (Appendix IV).

III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
12.
In the discussions, there was agreement that Chile is well-placed to benefit from the
recovery of the world economy and undertake the structural reforms that would ensure
sustained economic growth over the medium-term. Over a number of years, policy
implementation in Chile has been largely congruent with the tenor of Fund advice (Box 2).
The authorities noted that the Chilean economy rests on solid pillars, including: (i) a strong
fiscal position with counter-cyclical capacity; (ii) a well-tested inflation targeting monetary
policy in the context of a flexible exchange rate regime; (iii) a robust financial system; and

- 10 -

(iv) a competitive, open economy. They concurred that short-term risks existed—largely
external, but were confident that the challenges could be successfully addressed. The
authorities were actively engaged in a rich public debate on the policies needed to sustain a
high rate of economic growth over the medium term, with growing consensus on the need to
reform the labor market and the educational system, promote competition, and improve
income distribution.
Box 2. Policy Recommendations and Implementation
• Chile’s policy implementation has been broadly consistent with the general thrust of Fund policy
advice. In recent years, Fund advice has concentrated on steps to consolidate the country’s
accomplishments. In the area of fiscal policy, the Fund provided advice to enrich the structural balance
rule, proposing reliance on a panel of experts to contribute to the forecast of copper reference prices
and the output gap. More recently, the main focus has been on improving transparency, and the Chilean
authorities have made considerable progress in migrating toward Fund standards. The staff has
generally supported the authorities’ approach on monetary policy and provided technical assistance on
interest rate transmission mechanisms and monetary policy issues.
• On structural reform issues, the discussions have included the need to increase labor market
flexibility and build further on Chile’s impressive achievements in trade openness. The authorities
concurred with the advice but progress in the labor area has been limited, in part because of
institutional constraints. In the past, the Fund commended the authorities for the unilateral reduction of
its uniform external tariff. Past missions have encouraged a phase out of price bands on certain
agricultural products, and sugar and wheat are now the only two remaining products with (WTOcompliant) price bands.
• Chile’s policies are also broadly consistent the Fund’s standards and code initiatives. A fiscal ROSC
was completed in 2003, and an FSAP was completed recently.

A. Short-Term Economic Prospects and Risks
13.
The authorities and staff concurred that economic growth was expected to pick up to
about 5 percent in 2004. Officials noted that the economy seemed poised for a rebound, thanks
to a supportive external environment, monetary stimulus, and high copper prices. They
expected the rebound in the global economy and the improvement in profit outlook to deliver a
strong rise in investment in the second half of 2004. The output gap would close slowly, with
economic growth moderately above trend, and inflation would gradually return to the central
bank’s target band, at about 2 percent by end–2004.4 Largely reflecting higher copper prices,
the current account would register a surplus of 1 percent of GDP in 2004 (Table, inset).

4

Trend GDP growth is estimated at 4 percent in 2004 and 4¼ percent
over the medium term, down from 6½ percent in the 1990s, reflecting slower total factor productivity
and employment growth.

The authorities viewed the risks to the short-term outlook, largely stemming from
external sources, to be manageable. There was agreement that a sharp increase in world
interest rates and oil prices could weigh on growth, dampening both domestic and external
demand and making external financing conditions more difficult. However, the authorities
were confident that the economy could weather these risks with relative ease.5 They
recognized the risks of lower copper prices, especially in the event of weaker-thananticipated global activity, but noted that these risks were modest given the low level of
world copper inventories.6 The impact of higher interest rates abroad would also be relatively
small, given that external public debt is low and that private corporations have taken
advantage of low interest rates to restructure debt. The authorities expected the disruption of
natural gas supplies from Argentina to remain sporadic and estimated that, in a worst case
scenario, output growth would be reduced by about 0.1 percent in 2004. They also noted that
the issue should be resolved by end–2005, as several new power plants would be completed,
relieving pressure on the electricity grid, while the new electricity law would gradually
encourage additional investment in the electricity sector (Box 3).

5

Chile imports most of its oil, and a sensitivity analysis shows that a 10 percent increase in oil prices
would reduce the 2004 external current account surplus by about ½ percent of GDP.

6

A moderate decline in copper prices would have a limited direct impact on the economy. In the
corporate sector, profits would move closer to long-term levels, which would negatively affect
investment. In the public finances, the surpluses accrued to the Copper Stabilization Fund would be
reduced but, given the structural balance rule, lower prices would not impact on long term fiscal health.

- 12 -

Box 3. Energy Policy
• Since 1997, Chile has increased its reliance on gas-fired power generation plants and,

correspondingly, its dependence of gas imports from Argentina. By 2003, gas-fired plants supplied
about 40 percent of total electricity demand, with gas imports from Argentina accounting for
98 percent of the gas supply. Given their cost effectiveness, gas-fired plants rapidly displaced coal and
diesel plants, especially in northern Chile, home to the vast majority of the mining industry, providing
more than 60 percent of power generation in this region.

• In early April, Argentina announced a unilateral cut in natural gas exports to Chile. The cut, of
15 percent initially, was raised to 40 percent in May, but reduced to 15-20 percent in mid-June. These
cuts are expected to be temporary, and thus unlikely to have a major impact on the economy. In the
short run, power generation firms are meeting electricity demand by bringing existing coal and dieselfired plants back online, albeit at significantly higher costs. Newly installed hydroelectric capacity is
also expected to help ease supply.

• The increased vulnerability of energy supply from Argentina and the need to speed up investment on
power generation in coming years raise questions on the development of the electricity sector.
Deeper and prolonged cuts could become a significant source of risk. Power consumption in the central
region of the country is expanding rapidly as the economy rebounds, and the situation could become
more difficult in the case of a harsh winter. A 2003 report noted that expected electricity demand
growth would put significant strain on the projected supply capacity, especially during dry years.

• A new electricity law (Ley Corta) was approved in early 2004, aimed at increasing electricity

generating capacity and improving transmission systems. The law promotes the interconnection of
existing networks and changes the fees paid by generation and distribution companies to transmission
companies. In an effort to end disputes between companies, transmission fees are no longer to be
negotiated between transmission and generation companies in individual contracts. The law also aims
at stabilizing node prices by allowing a fluctuation of up to 5 percent from the market price negotiated
in private contracts (down from 10 percent previously). The new law also establishes the creation of a
panel of experts to mediate disputes among companies, and between them and the authorities. The new
law is expected to boost investment in electricity generation by reducing regulatory uncertainty.

B. Fiscal Policy and the Structural Balance Rule
15.
The structural balance rule has successfully anchored fiscal policy. The rule targets
a cyclically-adjusted surplus of 1 percent of

16.
The government has reaffirmed its commitment to comply with the fiscal rule
in 2004 and to continue resisting pressure to increase spending. The authorities noted that
the fiscal expenditure stance would remain cautious and, thus far, they have been successful
in resisting pressure to increase spending and extend subsidies on domestic petroleum
products. Beginning in 2004, the budget includes special funds for the military as part of the
structural balance.7 To that effect, revenue accruing to the military—which includes
10 percent of the sales of the state copper company CODELCO (estimated at ½ percent of
GDP in 2004)—can only be spent with the prior authorization of both the defense ministry
and the budget office. This commitment to fiscal prudence has not come at the cost of social
programs; instead, recent social spending has been higher than in the late 1990s (Table 3).
17.
The mission enquired about prospects for entrenching the structural balance rule
over the medium term. The staff noted that the authorities’ commitment to the structural
balance rule had given substantial credibility to their fiscal policy; however, this rule was not
embodied in law. The authorities concurred that the rule had achieved considerable support
and anticipated that the next administration would maintain it—perhaps with relatively
limited changes. In coming months, the government plans to introduce legislation to require
future budgets to include an indicator of the structural balance. This would, in their view,
help further formalize the fiscal rule, and the mission encouraged the authorities to take
further steps toward institutionalizing this rule.
7

Under Ley Reservada 13.196, the military receives transfers from CODELCO equal to 10 percent of
its copper sales. Until the 2004 budget, these revenue and expenditure data were not published.

- 14 -

18.
The authorities are prudently using the resources accrued to the Copper
Stabilization Fund (CSF) to pay down debt. Assuming an average copper price of
US$1.20 a pound, the CSF is expected to accumulate resources of US$1–1½ billion in 2004.
The government is planning to use a significant part of these resources to prepay expensive
debt. During January-April 2004, the government pre-paid US$335 million in debts to the
World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.
19.
The authorities offered a spirited defense of their plans to impose a fee on private
mining companies. Although not yet final at the time of the consultation discussions, its
main feature would be the imposition of a 0–3 percent fee on the profits of mining
companies. They considered that, while academic work pointed to the need to tax
nonrenewable resources, most mining companies had, in practice, avoided paying taxes, in
part thanks to accelerated depreciation rules. The staff concurred, but noted private sector
concerns that the government might be retreating from an implicit guarantee not to increase
taxes on foreign mining companies for a period of up to twenty years after investments have
taken place. The staff, therefore, advised the authorities to only impose the fee on new
investments, to avoid any impression of a change in the rules of the game. The authorities
noted the difficulty of changing tax laws and distinguishing old investments from new ones.
They explained that they were preparing a modified plan with a three-year transition period,
under which the fee would only be binding for new investments. The authorities plan to use
the annual proceeds from the fee—expected to be small, at about ¼ percent of GDP—to help
promote technological and scientific innovation.
20.
The authorities welcomed the opportunity to participate in a pilot project evaluating
public investment. They noted that they had a long and successful track record of using
Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs). Overall, infrastructure investments under the PPP
framework had amounted to close to US$6 billion over the past ten years, with contingent
liabilities for the government of about US$1 billion. The authorities welcomed further work
with Fund staff on public investment and fiscal policies.
21.
The officials also welcomed further assistance in compiling fiscal statistics, but
reiterated their long-standing views of some international standards. Starting with FY2004,
the authorities published the budget using most of the methodology in the Fund’s
Government Financial Statistics Manual (GFSM). However, full migration will not be
achieved until the central bank is recapitalized. The authorities also concurred that other
discrepancies persisted between the official data and GFSM, related to inflation and dollarindexed debt (Appendix III), and agreed to publish a chapter in the FY2005 budget to outline
the issues. The officials also welcomed further STA technical assistance in that area.

22.
The Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) shows that Chile’s debt is resilient to
shocks. With the structural fiscal rule, the net public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to
gradually decline over the medium term,

foreign-owned firms, with one third of this debt representing the claims of parent companies.
C. Maintaining a Strong and Credible Monetary Policy Framework
23.
The authorities and the mission concurred that inflation targeting has successfully
helped guide inflationary expectations. Since

expectations. An effective communication
strategy has been key to the transparency of the monetary policy design in Chile (Box 5).
24.
The monetary authorities reaffirmed their commitment to maintaining inflation
close to the mid-point of the 2–4 percent target range. They consider that well-anchored
expectations are key to ensuring effective countercyclical policies and remarked that the
inflation objective of the central bank was well-accepted and understood by the general
public. Although monetary policy had continued to be stimulative, the central bank was
carefully monitoring the appropriate time to withdraw stimulus; the output gap was still
large; the outlook for oil prices uncertain; and there was evidence that the Chilean core CPI
indicator was gradually converging, from below, to the official target band. The authorities
reaffirmed their readiness to move decisively whenever conditions would indicate that a
tightening of monetary policy is needed.

- 16 -

Box 5. Central Bank Communication Strategy
In an inflation targeting framework, communication is key. The periodic communication of the central
bank’s inflation objectives, as well as its views about the economy, helps generate public understanding of
the central bank’s policies, hence increasing the credibility of the policy, anchoring inflation expectations
and, in turn, facilitating price stability. An important component of this communication strategy is the
central bank’s Monetary Policy Report published three times a year.

A recent study evaluates the effectiveness of
cross-country inflation reports. In a recent
assessment, Fracasso, Genberg, and Wyplosz
(2003)1 suggest that a good report should:
(i) contain a concise but complete executive
summary, and a discussion of special topics;
(ii) provide continuity for the reader’s ease
and be transparent about the assumptions
behind key macroeconomic variables and the
forecast of inflation; and (iii) present the risks
associated with the forecast. The Bank of
England’s report sets the standard on all the
categories used in the ranking, while Chile
ranks fifth. The report stresses the need to
keep the general public well informed and
minimize market surprises.

Several communication outlets contribute to the transparency of the monetary policy design in Chile:
• A communiqué is released at the conclusion of the monthly bank’s Board of Directors policy meeting
which, in turn, is announced six months in advance.
• The Minutes of the monthly policy meetings of the Board of Directors are released within 3 weeks.
• The central bank testifies once a year before the full Senate and twice before the Finance Committee.
The central bank also meets frequently with the private sector to discuss the inflation outlook.
• The central bank publishes its Analysts’ Forecast Survey (including inflation, GDP growth, interest
rates, and exchange rate forecasts) on a monthly basis, and a survey on credit conditions on a quarterly
basis.
• The presentations made by the central bank’s authorities before different forums are posted on the
central bank’s web page. The bank publishes all relevant economic and financial data as soon as they
become available.
• The central bank regularly publishes high caliber economic policy and working papers. It has released a
description of the structural and auxiliary models used in its inflation forecasting and policy research.

The mission commended the authorities for their flexible exchange rate policy.
Since the beginning of 2003, the peso has displayed significant volatility, largely reflecting
changes in the external environment. From mid-March 2003 through mid-January 2004, the
peso appreciated by about 23 percent against the U.S. dollar, but it has since then depreciated
by close to 11 percent (Figure 10). The economy seems to have coped well. There is growing
evidence that the market for foreign exchange hedging has deepened, with sectors long in

which hold about 27 percent of their assets

Chile’s external competitiveness remains
sound, as evidenced by the strong growth in

2004.

gross reserves level (Figure 11). This
policy, which would help reduce the central bank’s quasi-fiscal losses, does not entail
intervention in the foreign exchange market—given that the net foreign exchange position
would remain unchanged. The staff concurred that there was some scope for a reduction in
the stock of dollar-indexed debt, given the comfortable level of gross official reserves.8
However, the mission advised the authorities to move prudently and avoid too large a decline
in gross reserves, as this could adversely affect market perceptions and confidence. The
authorities concurred, noting that they would keep their plans under review, based on
financial market developments.
27.
The mission inquired about the status of the recapitalization of the central bank.9
The authorities reaffirmed their willingness to recapitalize the central bank. They explained
8

More details are presented in the paper on the Optimal Level of Reserves in the companion Selected
Issues Papers.

9

The recapitalization of the central bank, which has long been part of the Fund’s advice, is needed to
eliminate the central bank’s operational deficit. The origins of this deficit can be traced to the support
provided during the banking crisis of the early 1980s, and to the financing of foreign reserves
accumulation during the early 1990s. The deficit also reflects a central government policy of paying
only part of the accrued interest of its debt held by the central bank.

- 18 -

that the finance ministry and the central bank had made good progress toward the technical
work in this area. However, they noted that the recapitalization would impact the central
government accounts, thus forcing a redefinition of the structural balance rule. In the
meantime, as a first step, they planned to advance the repayment of government debt held by
the central bank, to help reduce its quasi-fiscal losses.
D. Enhancing the Strength of the Financial Sector
28.
The authorities welcomed the conclusions of the recent FSAP and expressed strong
confidence in the soundness of the banking system. The FSAP team found the Chilean
banking sector sound and well-regulated and supervised (Box 6). They noted that an efficient
allocation of resources will require enhancing competition in financial services, filling some
gaps in market infrastructure, and adapting the oversight framework to meet the needs of an
increasingly integrated and complex financial system. They also pointed out the need to
address issues in the insurance sector, including some under-provisioning of risks. The
authorities were in broad agreement with the findings of the FSAP and indicated that they
would follow up on its main recommendations. Improved financial conditions and a deeper
financial market have helped create the conditions for strong economic growth. In 2003,
bank lending increased sharply; corporate bond issuance reached record levels; and the
equity market showed signs of renewed activity. With debt leverage for firms and consumers
still low by historical and international standards, the authorities expected further credit
growth, spurred by still low domestic interest rates and improving economic conditions.
29.
The mission acknowledged the strength of Chile’s financial system, and
commended the authorities for their efforts to move toward risk-based regulation and
supervision. Chile’s supervisory and regulatory regime is strong and well-established. The
transition to a more risked-based supervision, however, would require increasing efforts to
improve disclosure standards and bank management, particularly for securitization and
derivatives. The mission proposed easing bank restrictions on options markets, which would
provide a boost to the development of derivatives markets and allow a more efficient
allocation of risks. With the increasing sophistication of financial markets and corporate
sector, staff also underscored the need to continue promoting the analytical and technical
expertise, as well as the information processing capabilities, of supervisors and regulators.
30.
Declining credit risk, measured by lower delinquency rates, has helped push down
sharply the nonoperational costs of banks, providing a boost to net income. At the same
time, increased competition in consumer and large corporate lending, together with
improving bank efficiency, is contributing to a substantial narrowing of margins. As a result,
banks are stepping up their efforts to diversify their revenue sources into commission-based
activities. The authorities also noted that, with corporate profitability and consumers’
personal income increasing, borrowers should have room for additional borrowing without
compromising their repayment capacity.

- 19 -

Box 6. Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA): Summary of Findings
• The Chilean banking system was found to be sound, generally resilient to shocks, and wellsupervised. Banks are well capitalized, profitable, internationally integrated, and have relatively low
nonperforming loans. Stress tests indicate that they would absorb sizable macroeconomic shocks with
only a moderate impact on their solvency. Although bank competition remains limited, it has increased
significantly in recent years.
• Private pension funds are by far the dominant institutional investors in the country. There is room to
enhance their impact on the domestic financial system by a judicious relaxation of their overly
restrictive investment regime without undermining their fiduciary function. In addition, current efforts
to enhance competition in the industry should be intensified, and a more radical reform considered to
unbundle pension-related services that are subject to economies of scale (such as contributions
collection, accounts management, and payouts to retirees) from those services where price competition
can thrive (asset management). The insurance sector faces some under-provisioning of risks, increased
competition, and weaknesses in its resolution framework. The needed increase in provisions and
reforms to the supervisory framework should be carefully planned and phased in.
• Some important gaps in market infrastructure that limit market liquidity and investment need to be
filled. This will require embedding more firmly in the law key concepts underlying securities clearance
and settlement, organizing a market for securities lending, introducing multilateral netting arrangements,
and formalizing the system of market makers. Valuation methods and contract standardization in
securities markets and disclosure in the OTC market need to be improved. International financial reporting
standards for listed firms should be introduced and a review of financial sector taxation conducted.
• The current segmented financial oversight has functioned adequately so far but should adapt to the
needs of an increasingly integrated and complex financial system. Reforms should focus, in the short
term, on enhancing cooperation among regulators and filling the gaps in systemic market surveillance.
For the medium term, legal changes will be needed to support the fully consolidated supervision of
financial conglomerates. This move should be accompanied by further progress from rule-based to
risk-based supervision, coupled with a strengthening of the financial and legal autonomy of the
supervisory agencies and enhanced accountability.
• The AML/CFT framework needs strengthening by: (i) addressing the limited sanctioning powers of
the Financial Intelligence Unit and its inadequate access to information; and (ii) extending the range of
application of AML/CFT to foreign exchange operators, securities firms, and insurance companies.

31.
Officials viewed the proposed reform of the capital markets (Capital Market II) as
another step toward promoting further bank competition and broadening the development
of domestic capital markets. The proposal provides strong incentives for the development of
the venture capital industry, which is expected to help small- and medium-sized enterprises
gain readier access to capital (most of their financing, thus far, has been from the
government-owned Banco Estado and the specialized fund CORFO). The reform also
includes provisions to standardize pledges on collateral and create a national registry of
pledges. A number of initiatives also seek to strengthen regulation and supervision, including
improving operating standards in the securities industry, broadening the powers of the
supervisory agencies, and increasing information-sharing across agencies. The authorities
emphasized that the reform proposal also incorporates some key recommendations of the
recent Corporate Governance ROSC to align corporate law with OECD standards.

- 20 -

32.
The mission welcomed the authorities’ consideration of proposals to foster worker
participation and asset management competition in the private pension system. The system
has undergone extensive consolidation in recent years, with the number of funds reduced
from 21 in the mid–1990s to only six funds in 2004. The authorities pointed to three key
challenges for the system:
•

Increasing the coverage of individual accounts, as less than half of the affiliated
workers contribute on a regular basis and are eligible for a minimum pension
(minimum pensions require a total of 20 years of contributions);

•

Reducing operational costs, which remain high by international standards; and

•

Increasing asset management competition, as the current regulatory regime is
somewhat restrictive and cumbersome.

Staff agreed that the recent creation of the voluntary pension system in which all financial
intermediaries can compete should enhance competition in the pension industry. Nonetheless,
the mission encouraged the authorities to outsource operational management services and to
rationalize the investment regime, with a view to allowing greater diversification of funds.
33.
Officials agreed that Chile’s AML/CFT framework requires further adjustments to
be in line with international standards. Chile is a member of GAFISUD, the regional intergovernmental organization which brings together the countries of South America in order to
combat money laundering and terrorism. In its 2003 report, GASFISUD commended the
Chilean authorities for the creation of a Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and for stepping up
disclosure requirements by financial institutions. However, subsequent rulings of the
Constitutional Court reduced the sanctioning powers of the FIU and denied it access to
information protected by bank secrecy. The authorities have recognized these shortcomings,
and are considering steps to address them. They have also agreed to allow publication of the
AML/CFT ROSC on the Fund’s website.
E. Sustaining Strong Economic Growth into the Medium-Term
34.
Attention is being focused on the agenda to sustain strong growth over the medium
term. To rekindle Chile’s economic growth, which has slowed to 2½ percent a year on
average since 1998, the authorities are implementing the Pro-Growth Agenda—a set of
reforms intended to address various constraints on growth and reduce regulatory uncertainty
in key sectors of the economy. In recent months, congress has approved several of the
reforms included in this agenda (Appendix V). The authorities stressed that the benefits of
the reforms implemented in the last two decades would continue to be felt for at least a few
more years. However, they recognized that further reforms were needed to sustain strong
productivity and growth beyond then, including through continued trade liberalization, labor
reform, and improvements in health and education.

- 21 -

External markets
35.
The mission commended the authorities for helping advance trade liberalization.
In 2003, Chile’s external tariff rate averaged only 2½ percent, among the lowest in the world.
Chile’s ambitious effort to negotiate bilateral free-trade arrangements (FTAs) meant that more
than 90 percent of Chilean export products benefited from preferential treatment in export
markets, with the recently implemented FTAs with the European Union and the United States
expected to have significant positive effects on growth over the medium term. Although the
authorities underscored their strong support for the Doha Round, they also indicated their
continued interest in additional bilateral trade agreements. Following the completion of
negotiations with South Korea, the authorities were planning new bilateral agreements with
several Asian countries including: (i) a closer cooperation agreement with New Zealand and
Singapore to improve products’ competitiveness in third markets; (ii) a broad FTA with
China; and (iii) a trade liberalization agreement with India for a limited list of products.
36.
The authorities underscored that Chile’s foreign investment platform provides one
of the world’s most open regimes, as well as a stable legal framework.10 Chile has no
financial account restrictions, except for the one-year residency requirement for the equity
portion of investment under Decree Law 600, a nonmandatory agreement with foreign
investors. The authorities noted that the investment chapter in the U.S. FTA included
far-reaching requirements in the areas of intellectual property and financial services. While
recognizing the authorities’ efforts to reach double taxation agreements with major investment
partner countries, staff noted that market participants, at times, expressed concerns about the
excessive complexity of domestic taxation rules for foreign portfolio investors.
Labor market, Education, and Income
Inequality
37.
Chile’s economy would benefit from
increased labor flexibility. Two recent
studies show that Chile’s labor market is less
flexible than those of Canada, New Zealand,
and Korea, but somewhat more flexible than
those of some European countries.11
Although Chile’s unemployment rate
continues to show a downward trend, it
remains relatively high (Figure 12). The

According to the OECD, only the United Kingdom and Ireland have a lower measure of FDI
restrictiveness than Chile. In particular, Chile has no investment restrictions in sensitive sectors such
as finance, telecommunications, and electricity.

J. Restrepo—Seventh Annual Conference of the central bank of Chile on Labor Markets and
Institutions, November 2003; and OECD Economic Surveys: Chile, Chapter IV, November 2003.

- 22 -

authorities agreed that more flexibility should be introduced in the labor market. Specifically,
current limits on hours worked, the length of standard labor contracts, high dismissal costs,
and limits on part-time employment hamper the development of the Chilean labor market.
However, legislation to introduce more flexibility continues to face stiff opposition from
labor unions, making passage unlikely in the short-term. The authorities agreed with the staff
that any increases in the minimum wage would have to be consistent with the objective of
preserving competitiveness and employment.
38.
The authorities see improvements in education as central to raising total factor
productivity and reducing income inequality. There is some evidence that the education
voucher system introduced in Chile in 1980 has led to some improvement in quality, but this
program is generally seen as costly, poorly supervised, and lacking in efficiency. Although
the average years of schooling has increased from 8¾ years in 1990 to 10½ years in 2002, the
OECD’s measurement of average proficiency in reading, mathematics, and sciences for
15-year old students is low by international standards. In addition, large quality differences
persist across socio-economic sectors, and only 30 percent of high school graduates attend
college. The authorities are seeking improvements in the qualification requirements and
salaries of teachers. Some elements of merit pay were introduced in 1994, but they need to be
broadened and a new system of accountability and incentives introduced. The authorities also
indicated that they plan to promote broader access to tertiary education through loans and
subsidies. The government also intends to press ahead with a program to expand and
rationalize research and development spending.12
39.
Reflecting in part the benefits of strong economic growth, poverty has been cut in
half since 1990 (Figure 13). The authorities have recently introduced a new program, Chile
Solidario, aimed at addressing some of
Figure 13. Poverty rates, 1990-2000

reduction programs. Chile Solidario is

According to the OECD, total research and development spending is equivalent to only ½ percent
of GDP—well below the OECD average of 2½ percent of GDP.

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
40.
The Chilean authorities are to be commended for the continued implementation of
well-designed policies. Their adherence to prudent fiscal policies together with the successful
implementation of the inflation targeting framework are noteworthy. The prudent
macroeconomic stance and strong economic institutions have effectively led to sustained
economic growth and a sharp reduction in poverty. In 2004, real GDP growth is projected to
gather further momentum, while inflation would gradually return within the inflation target
band. Reflecting the global recovery, copper prices have remained high and are expected to
help generate a surplus in the current account balance in 2004.
41.
In recent years, the fiscal rule has gained considerable credibility, reflecting the
authorities’ firm commitment to prudent fiscal policy. The staff encourages the authorities
to take further steps toward institutionalizing the rule and secure the necessary consensus to
ensure that it is preserved over the medium term. Staff welcomes Chile’s decision to
participate in a pilot program on public investment and fiscal policies.
42.
The inflation targeting framework is working well. The low levels of 12–month CPI
inflation registered in early 2004 largely reflected the earlier appreciation of the peso, and
surveys show that the core CPI is gradually returning to the center of the inflation target
band. The central bank has effectively communicated its policy, and thereby helped anchor
inflation expectations.
43.
The strengths of the policy framework should help Chile weather well the largely
external risks to the outlook. The long-delayed recovery in investment now seems well
under way and conditions are in place to sustain strong output growth into 2005. The
expected increase in global interest rates, high prevailing oil prices, and the issues associated
with the supply of gas constitute risks, but they appear manageable.
44.
The current stance of monetary policy is appropriate. Given the persistent output
gap and inflation expectations anchored at the middle of the target range, monetary policy
could support domestic demand for some time. The authorities’ readiness to raise interest
rates as soon as required by domestic and external conditions is appropriate.
45.
The staff supports the central bank policy of nonintervention in the foreign
exchange market. External competitiveness is appropriate, as evidenced by the strong
growth of nontraditional exports.
46.
The FSAP team concluded that the financial system is strong, while recommending
a number of measures to enhance it further. Staff appreciates the authorities’ intention to
follow the FSAP recommendations closely, to help further improve the depth of the financial
system and the competitiveness of the banking system.
47.
Although the proposal to introduce a fee on mining companies has gathered broad
popular support, staff would encourage caution in that area. Any change in the taxation of

- 24 -

mining companies would have to be prepared carefully to ensure that it does not interfere
with investment guarantees and increase investor uncertainty.
48.
Staff encourages the authorities to continue their work toward the recapitalization
of the central bank. While, in a first stage, steps are expected to be taken to reduce the stock
of government debt held by the central bank, the objective of recapitalizing the central bank
should continue to be actively pursued.
49.
Chile’s emphasis on free trade is commendable. The recent free trade agreements
with the EU and the United States, as well as current bilateral initiatives, are further welcome
steps. The staff would encourage the authorities to eliminate the price-band scheme that
remains in place for a few agricultural goods.
50.
Staff is encouraged by the open debate on policies to promote strong economic
growth and further reduce poverty over the medium term. Enhancing education and labor
flexibility are key to promoting strong and sustainable growth and reduce poverty. One of the
main challenges will also be to ensure that the children of the poor have access to education,
where there is room for improvement. Chile Solidario is a promising approach to deal with
poverty in a comprehensive manner.
51.
Chile’s medium term outlook remains favorable. Public debt ratios are low, and the
sustained implementation of the fiscal rule is consistent with a further decline in the public debt
to GDP ratio over the medium term. While the external debt of the private sector is relatively
high, it does not give rise to concern because it is at relatively long terms, and part of the debt
is held as claims of parent companies on their Chilean affiliates.
52.
Chile’s data are of good quality, timely, and adequate for surveillance purposes.
With the introduction of the 2004 budget, the authorities have removed most of the
differences that existed with Fund standards. The authorities have sought technical
assistance, so as to produce high quality data.
53.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Chile be held on the
standard 12–month cycle.

Government Finance Statistics Manual (2001). Details are available as accounting differences (memorandum items).
2/ Calculated using the authorities' accounting methodology; this balance does not include the capitalized interest on BCCh
debt and the valuation changes to the stock of UF debt. In 2004 and 2005, these estimates also reflect the authorities' economic assumptions.
As a result, the revenue estimates differ, largely because the staff and the authorities have different copper price assumptions.

APPENDIX II

Chile—Financial Relations with the World Bank
The most recent Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Chile, covering Fiscal Years
2002-05, was discussed by the Executive Board of the Bank in February 2002. The CAS
calls for selectively focusing on areas in which the Bank has accumulated substantial
knowledge and where the Government feels that the Bank can be instrumental in ensuring the
successful implementation of its initiatives. To that aim, the strategy proposes to diversify the
forms of financial assistance by providing for direct financing through regular investment
and policy-based lending as well as for contingent financing.
The CAS also reflects efforts by the current administration to address persistent social
challenges through improvements in the social safety net and human capital. Support in
the area of social protection is being provided under the recently approved Social Protection
Adjustment Loan DDO (FY04) and the accompanying TA loan, which aims at increasing
access to social protection and social services for the neediest households. This loan is also
expected to support Chile Solidario. Support in the area of human capital development has
been provided through the Science for the Knowledge Economy Project (FY03), which
fosters the developments of an effective innovation system and aims at improving the stock
of human capital in the Chilean science and technology sector.
The IFC provides support for private infrastructure, small and medium enterprises,
specialized financing in housing, and for the social sector. The IFC considers that Chile is a
country from which experience can be learned for other countries, both within and outside
the Latin America region. In addition, the IFC provides support to Chilean companies in their
efforts to grow abroad. MIGA’s support is expected to facilitate foreign direct investment in
Chile.
There are currently six investment loans in Chile’s operations portfolio, totaling
US$290.5 million in commitments (Table). Two of these loans, in support of the Second
Municipal Development Project (FY99) and the Higher Education Project (FY99), had
already been approved when the present CAS was discussed. The remaining four loans, in
support of Public Expenditure Management (FY02), Lifelong Learning (FY02), Science for
the Knowledge Economy (FY03), and the Social Protection TA Loan (FY04) are covered by
the current CAS. A Social Protection Adjustment Loan DDO in the amount of
US$200 million, also approved in FY04, has been fully disbursed. Additional lending in
FY2005–06 is expected to be in support of urban transport, other rural infrastructure services,
and municipal development.

APPENDIX III

Chile—Statistical Issues
Monetary and real sectors
The central bank publishes comprehensive statistics on the real and monetary sectors on a
bi-weekly basis. STA is providing assistance to improve the quarterly national accounts, and has
recently helped improve the classification and expand the institutional coverage of the monetary
accounts. The new monetary statistics were published starting with the July 2003 issue of
International Financial Statistics; revised time series based on the new methodology are now
available to December 1997.
Government finances and debt
The Ministry of Finance publishes data on the central government and a summary of the
accounts of the nonfinancial public sector. Beginning in 2003, central government operations
data are published on a monthly basis, while data on the municipalities and public enterprises are
presented on an annual basis, with a lag.
In the past, there were large differences between Chile’s budget presentation and
international standards. Chile had two large inconsistencies with international standards
which, if corrected, would have led to an increase in the deficit of around ½ percent of GDP:
•

Off-budget transactions including: (i) military revenue and expenditures under Law
13.196, which dedicates 10 percent of the revenue from CODELCO’s sales to the
military; (ii) subsidies to the private sector through the Petroleum Stabilization Fund;
and (iii) transactions involving the Copper Stabilization Fund that should have been
recorded as net financing (and not income).

•

The budget was strictly on a cash basis, leading to a significant understatement of
expenditures when the government delayed payments on bonds held by the central
bank—something it often did. Most of the bonds yield LIBOR plus 50 basis points,
and the Treasury has the option of capitalizing all interest above 2 percent. This
capitalized interest should be recognized as an interest expense.

With the introduction of the 2004 budget, the authorities rectified the most significant
discrepancies and published a detailed list of their changes. Most importantly, the offbudget transactions were displayed and included in the budget. In addition, the authorities
introduced accrual accounting for most transactions. This change means that the budget now
records copper income on an accrual basis, and the Copper Stabilization Fund operates as a
financing vehicle to help meet the accrued copper income. Finally, the authorities made
progress in presenting the budget data in categories used by Government Financial Statistics
Manual (GFSM 2001).

- 38 -

APPENDIX III

Additional improvements to the fiscal statistics are anticipated during 2004.
•

The central government will begin recording transactions in an integrated financial
management system (SIGFE) that will allow real-time reports of fiscal transactions,
on an accrual basis.

•

Expenditure data will be presented according to GFSM 2001 classifications.

•

Quarterly data back to 1987 will be made available, along with detailed balance sheet
data—including, for the first time, an estimate of consumption of fixed capital.

•

The authorities agreed to publish information on the effects of inflation on the value
of inflation-indexed bonds in the forthcoming FY2005 budget.

Only two differences remain between the authorities’ expenditure data and the
methodology suggested by the GFSM 2001.
•

Interest payments on Treasury debt held by the central bank is still recorded on a cash
basis. As a result, interest recorded in the budget can be lower than the actual interest
due (which should be on an accrual basis), because part of the interest payment on the
debt held by the central bank is deferred.

•

The authorities plan to only publish, but not include as an interest expense, the
valuation changes due to inflation on indexed bonds in the budget.

As Table 2 indicates, these differences are not expected to be large in 2004. Into the mediumterm, these two differences would increase expenditure by only ¼-½ percent of GDP.
Balance of payments and external debt
The central bank compiles balance of payments statistics on a quarterly basis, and
publishes comprehensive statistics on the external sector on a bi-weekly basis. The process
of reconciliation of data on short-term debt data with the BIS has been completed. Beginning
in 2002, the central bank publishes the International Investment Position consistent with the
balance of payments statement.
The coverage of the military sector in the external statistics is still not complete. In
particular, the accuracy of data on military imports is unclear, as those imports that do not
pass through customs are estimated by the central bank. Also, if the military receives external
credits, information on this may not be available to the central bank; therefore, such
financing may not appear in the balance of payments or external debt statistics.

APPENDIX IV

Chile—Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)

1.
This appendix assesses Chile’s debt sustainability. The fiscal sustainability analysis
focuses on the net debt of the non-financial public sector, because the central government
holds a large stock of assets.1 In contrast, the external sustainability focuses on the gross debt
position of the economy.
2.
Under the baseline scenario for the public sector, over the medium term fiscal
prudence as embedded in the structural balance rule would lead to a further decline in
the—already low—net debt-to-GDP ratio. The primary balance would remain in surplus
over the forecast horizon, well above

standards and, in most cases, would
stabilize at or below 20 percent (Figure 1).

3.
In the baseline scenario, external debt would remain well-contained over the
medium term (Table 2). The relatively high gross external debt to GDP ratio reflects high
borrowing abroad by the corporate sector (at end-2003, external public debt was equivalent
to only 9¼ percent of GDP). The ratio of gross external debt to GDP has improved sharply in
recent years, due to the appreciation of the Chilean peso. The external debt of the private
sector is relatively high, but there are mitigating factors to external vulnerability, including
the presence of natural hedges for the export sector and access to financial hedges. Shortterm debt on a residual maturity basis represents only 22 percent of private sector external
debt, and the average duration of medium-term debt is above five years. More than half of
1

A net debt concept is used in the fiscal sustainability analysis because the central government holds
a large stock of assets (7 percent of GDP at end-2003). Three categories of debt are not included in
the assessment. First, a large stock of debt is in the form of recognition bonds (16 percent of GDP by
end-2003), which represent the transition costs from the old pay-as-you-go public pension system to
the private pension fund system. The amortization of this debt is not available in the Public Debt
Report, so the decline in the debt may be somewhat overstated in the DSA. Second, the central bank
debt stock is large (around 30 percent of GDP by end-2003), but offset by assets (mainly foreign
reserves and Treasury debt), so that its net debt is low (½ percent of GDP by end-2003). Finally, the
central government has contingent liabilities on investment guarantees undertaken by public and
private enterprises (around 10 percent of GDP).

- 41 -

APPENDIX IV

private external debt is owed by foreign-owned firms, with one third of this debt representing
the claims of parent companies. Over the medium term, the debt ratio is projected to remain
broadly stable, at around 50 percent of GDP.
4.
Chile’s external debt is sensitive
to shocks. Although shocks to real GDP
growth or the current account would have
a limited impact, external price shocks
would have a stronger impact on the debt
ratio (Figure 2). In particular, the stock of
debt is sensitive to exchange rate shocks;
indeed, the share of external debt rose to
above 60 percent of GDP in 2002
because of the sharp depreciation in the
exchange rate. Nevertheless, Chile’s
aggregate net international investment
position is strong, mitigating some of
these concerns (Table, inset).

While the private nonfinancial sector holds
debt abroad in the equivalent of 38 percent of GDP, most of it is medium and long-term
(close to 5 years) and it is offset in part by holdings of assets equivalent to close to 20 percent
(predominantly short-term).

improvements in the transmission systems
The first part of the Law extended (previously temporary) fishing rights for 10
years and eliminated the link between those rights and specific fishing vessels,
thereby reducing uncertainty and promoting investment in the sector. The
second part of the law would extend fishing rights for an additional 15 years,
and would deal with fishing quotas for small fisheries.
Setting uniform and transparent access fees between all telecommunication
companies.
Creation of 16 independent and specialized tax courts. Free from hierarchical
and administrative control of the internal revenue service (SII). Creation of
specialized tribunals at the Court of Appeals level.
Its objective is to reinforce the existing institutional framework and accelerate
the resolution of conflicts. The new court will replace the Anti-monopoly
Resolution Commission, which has ad-honorem members. The new court
would benefit from increased autonomy, quasi-permanent members, and a
permanent supporting staff.
Establishment of independent and specialized courts to deal with economic
issues.
Establishes a special regime to avoid double taxation on foreign enterprises
based in Chile to invest abroad.
Aimed at modernizing the current bankruptcy framework by making
bankruptcies part of an administrative process rather than a judicial process. It
should increase the overall economy’s efficiency by making bankruptcies a
“normal” result of a capitalist system.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 5, 2004

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Chile
On August 4, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Chile.1
Background
Over the past two decades, Chile has adhered to a sound and consistent policy framework. Its
policy mix has been based on open trade and exchange rate flexibility and, in recent years,
inflation targeting and achievement of a fiscal structural balance rule—requiring a cyclicallyadjusted, central government fiscal surplus of 1 percent of GDP. During 2000-03, the actual
overall balance of the central government registered a deficit of just below 1 percent of GDP
and, in 2004, the accounts of the central government are expected to register a surplus of
1.5 percent of GDP.
Real GDP growth averaged 3½ percent a year during 2000-03. Since the beginning of 2004,
economic activity has picked up, in the context of a favorable external environment. The global
economic recovery has helped boost export demand, particularly copper, the price of which has
nearly doubled since end-2002. Chile has also benefited from low world interest rates.
Reflecting in part these developments, real GDP grew by 6½ percent in seasonally-adjusted
terms during the first quarter, the strongest quarterly growth in 3 years, and the World Economic
Outlook projects a rate of growth of 5 percent for the year as a whole. Despite steady, albeit
modest, job gains, the unemployment rate has remained relatively high, at about 8½ percent.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2The improvement in terms of trade registered in late 2003 and early 2004 contributed to an
appreciation of the peso which, in turn, led to downward pressure on domestic prices. As a
result, twelve-month inflation temporarily fell below the 2-4 percent inflation target range.
In response to downward pressure on prices, and to provide stimulus to the economy, the
central bank cut its policy interest rates twice, by 50 basis points on each occasion, in
December 2003 and January 2004.
External conditions remain favorable. However, Argentina’s decision to sharply cut natural gas
exports is forcing domestic electricity generation to switch from relatively cheap natural gas to
more costly diesel-generated power. At the same time, increases in petroleum import prices
have raised costs further and dampened disposable income growth.
In the period ahead, the economy is expected to continue to gather momentum, and GDP is
projected to grow by about 5 percent a year in 2004 and 2005. Reflecting a supportive external
environment, high copper prices, and low interest rates, investment is expected to rebound in
the second half of 2004. As a result of moderate above-trend growth, the output gap would
close slowly, and inflation is expected to gradually return within the central bank’s target band.
High copper prices would help the external current account to register a surplus of about
1 percent of GDP in 2004.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Chilean authorities for their continued implementation of
sound policies, centered on a prudent fiscal policy, a successful inflation targeting framework,
and trade integration. These policies, together with a robust financial system, have led to
sustained economic growth and contributed to a sharp reduction in poverty, and constitute a
good example for other countries. Directors also noted that strong fundamentals allowed Chile
to weather the recent global downturn and should enable it to take full advantage of the rebound
in copper prices and increased global demand for its exports, contributing to a long-delayed
rebound in investment. Directors pointed to manageable risks associated with higher global
interest rates, oil prices, uncertainties regarding natural gas supplies, and possible changes in
copper prices.
Directors praised Chile’s commitment to a prudent fiscal policy, reinforced by adherence to a
structural balance rule, which calls for a surplus of 1 percent of GDP in the central government’s
fiscal accounts. They commended the authorities for reallocating spending to social priorities,
and for restraining overall spending, despite higher revenues from the surge in copper prices.
They supported the decision to use surpluses accrued in the Copper Stabilization Fund to
selectively prepay government debt. Directors commended the authorities for improving
transparency in the fiscal accounts and for publishing previously off-budget accounts, especially
with regard to military spending. Going forward, they welcomed the inclusion of an estimate of
the structural fiscal position in the budget. In this regard, several Directors recommended that
the authorities formalize the structural balance rule into a law, while several other Directors
thought that formalizing this rule would unnecessarily constrain the scope of countercyclical
fiscal policy.

-3Directors noted that the authorities’ proposal to introduce a royalty in the mining sector could
raise revenue and aid Chile’s management of its non-renewable resources, though they
cautioned that if introduced, it should be done in a manner that does not negatively impact
foreign investment.
With regard to monetary policy, Directors recognized the success of Chile’s inflation targeting
framework in anchoring inflation expectations. They viewed the current stance of monetary
policy as appropriate and as having provided adequate stimulus to the economy. Looking
forward, with inflation gradually returning to the mid-point of the central bank’s inflation target
band of 2–4 percent, they advised only a gradual removal of monetary stimulus, given the large
output gap and the persistence of a still high unemployment rate.
Directors agreed with the thrust of the central bank’s debt management strategy.
They supported the central bank’s ongoing process to deepen domestic financial markets by
introducing long-term peso-denominated bonds. They agreed with the central bank’s plans to
gradually redeem part of its dollar-indexed debt with foreign exchange reserves. Directors
encouraged the authorities to recapitalize the bank, which would contribute to resolving the
bank’s on-going quasi-fiscal deficits. A few Directors pointed to the need to link more explicitly
the structural balance rule to the quasi-fiscal deficit of the central bank.
Directors observed that the floating exchange rate regime has benefited the economy and
allowed it to adjust smoothly to external shocks. They commended the central bank for a policy
of nonintervention in the foreign exchange market, despite the sharp appreciation of the peso in
late 2003.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to follow the recommendations of the Financial
System Stability Assessment. They agreed that the financial system is sound and has withstood
well a large range of shocks over the past several years, and emphasized the important role of
sound regulations and strong supervision, particularly in the banking system. They noted,
however, the need to reduce risks in the insurance industry and strengthen regulation and
supervision of the securities industry. They also saw a need to improve further Anti-Money
Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism legislation.
Directors agreed that there was scope for improving the financial system’s efficiency.
They suggested that investment restrictions on pension funds could be judiciously liberalized, to
take advantage of economies of scale and increased competition. Directors highlighted the
need for the regulatory system to adapt to the increasing sophistication of financial markets,
where distinctions between entities had become more blurred, by moving to a high-quality
risk-based regulatory system that would take into account the interconnections between
different components of the financial system. They also noted that there was room to further
improve competition regarding the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises. To that
end, Directors welcomed the reforms contained in the new Capital Markets II draft law.
Looking to the medium-term, Directors praised the authorities’ on-going public debate on how to
sustain higher rates of growth while reducing income inequality. To that end, Directors
supported the recent laws to implement the Pro-Growth Agenda. In this context, they noted the
importance of liberalizing labor market laws and strengthening the educational system to

-4improve employment opportunities. Directors also praised the authorities for their social policies,
including Chile Solidario, which they viewed as an important example of a well-targeted
program to help reduce extreme poverty.
Directors underscored Chile’s leadership role in opening markets through comprehensive and
sustained trade and financial market liberalization. They welcomed the implementation of recent
bilateral trade agreements and also encouraged the authorities to continue their efforts at
multilateral trade liberalization. They observed that Chile’s exposure to external debt shocks
remained contained, since much of this debt resides with the private sector, which has access
to financial hedges, and external public debt ratios remain low.
Directors recognized that the data received by the Fund are of good quality, timely, and
adequate for surveillance purposes. They commended the authorities for making important
strides in bringing the fiscal statistics more closely in line with international standards and urged
that the authorities take the steps needed to close the relatively small gaps in coverage.
They also welcomed Chile’s decision to participate in the pilot project to evaluate public
investment and Public-Private Partnerships.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Chile will be held on the standard 12–
month cycle.

Growth has accelerated, following the thrust of exports, private consumption, and
more recently investment, in a relatively balanced way across sectors.
Higher prices for copper as well as for other exports have markedly improved the
terms of trade; the open trade strategy has permitted a sustained diversification of
Chile’s export base, as shown by the rapid increase in non-copper exports.
Employment growth remains sluggish, productivity is growing fast and the
unemployment rate is declining slowly. The recent acceleration in investment growth
should contribute towards a faster reduction in unemployment.
The flexible exchange rate and the credible-rules-based monetary and fiscal policies
allow demand-management policies to act counter cyclically.
Risks to the growth outlook appear manageable including that of the energy sector,
where diversification of supply continues.
The level of the private sector’s gross external debt does not represent a source of
vulnerability.
The FSAP indicates that the financial system is well- developed, sound, and resilient
to shocks, and helps to identify possible reforms and improvements, some of which
are already underway.
Under the currently supportive external environment, and the strength of its policy
framework and institutional arrangements, Chile is well positioned to return to faster
medium-term growth rates.
Improving the efficiency of the education system and well-focalized social policies
continue to be priorities for the Chilean government.

1.
The Chilean authorities once again express their appreciation to the staff for the valuable
policy discussions, including the FSAP exercise, as well as for the set of useful reports produced
for this consultation. My authorities consent to the publication of the Staff Report, the FSSA,
and the Special Issues Papers. Chile’s home-grown economic strategy has been strengthened
by a close policy dialogue with the Fund, despite having sometimes different views on
specific issues. The consultation process has contributed to refine some policies, but more
importantly has helped to better convey to the international community and financial markets the
foundations of Chile’s strategy.
2.
Concerns about the re-acceleration of economic activity that were important in last
year’s consultation have now largely subsided, with a balanced growth process taking hold.
GDP growth in the second quarter will be about 5 percent, while the consensus growth
forecast for this year has been raised to a similar rate, up from 4.5 percent at the time of last’s
year consultation. The significant strengthening of external demand and the improvement of
the terms of trade have led to an unprecedented export expansion during the first half of this

-2year (39 percent in value terms, compared to the first half of last year’s). The dynamism of
exports, coupled with a supportive monetary policy, has also been transmitted into faster
domestic demand growth, a phenomenon that was first evident in private consumption, and
that more recently is also seen in private investment, particularly in machinery and equipment.
Sectoral growth has been relatively balanced with Manufacturing, Agriculture, Construction,
Commerce, and Transport and Communications growing between 4.5 and 6.5 percent during
the first quarter this year. The exceptions in sectoral growth are the fisheries that have
expanded at two-digit rates, as a result of the sustained growth in fish farming and the
recovery of the traditional fishing activity after a particularly bad year and Mining that
suffered a temporary delay in the expansion of new projects.
3.
Copper continues to be very important for the Chilean economy, and this year’s
extraordinarily high prices have certainly been a key factor favoring the ongoing recovery.
Nevertheless, prices of other exports are also contributing to the improvement in the terms of
trade. In fact, the open-trade strategy has permitted a sustained diversification of Chile’s
export base, with copper falling to 36 percent of total exports of goods. In particular, this year
non-copper exports are growing close to 15 percent in volume terms. Such a diversification
process, together with a consistent macroeconomic policy framework and effective financial
sector regulation and supervision, has helped to increase the Chilean economy’s resilience to
external shocks. Moreover, as recognized by the staff in the context of last year’s Article IV
Consultation, the natural resource content of the Chilean export basket does not represent a
barrier to long-term growth.
4.
Notwithstanding the acceleration of output growth and the generalized sectoral
expansion, employment growth has remained somewhat sluggish. On the positive side, this
implies that a very significant expansion in productivity is taking place; however, it also
suggests that the sharp reduction in the unemployment rate that would strengthen the recovery
in private consumption has not developed yet. The unemployment rate peaked at 11.5 percent
in mid 1999 after a short-lived recession, and since then has gradually come down reaching
just over 9 percent in mid 2004, reflecting years of slow growth in output and employment.
Currently, however, with output growth robustly picking up, the unemployment rate should
decline more markedly. Such expectations have not being fulfilled so far, probably due to the
movements within employment towards better and more formal jobs, and the return to the
labor force of previously discouraged workers, as the perceived probability to find
employment increases in upturns. Eventually, however, the recent recovery in investment
expansion should translate into more dynamic employment creation and lower unemployment
rate.
5.
The credibility of the independent Central Bank of Chile (BCCH) has allowed the
implementation of a countercyclical monetary policy that is significantly contributing to the
ongoing recovery of domestic demand. Inflation, which has in general remained within the
target band, currently is converging towards it from below, after suffering the effects of
supply shocks that led to a short period of negative inflation some months ago. The
consolidation of low inflation is also facilitating the development of the capital market. In
such direction, the recently introduced 10-year Central Bank bonds denominated in Chilean
pesos are the longest non-indexed domestic currency instrument ever issued by the Chilean

-3public sector. Their yield (6.5%), and that of indexed instruments of the same maturity
(3.7%), means that the sum of implicit inflationary expectations and a risk premium or
discount are slightly below 3 percent. The alignment of inflationary expectations with the
center of the inflation target range, also confirmed by surveys, speaks by itself about the
credibility that monetary policy commands.
6.
The significant monetary stimulus would not have been possible without the room of
maneuver provided by the floating exchange rate system, the rules-based fiscal policy, and the
overall credibility of the policy framework. Foreign currency intervention has not been used
since early 2003, and a mix of financial regulations and market development has prepared the
private sector to confront exchange rate fluctuations. Fiscal policy has effectively targeted a
structural surplus equivalent to 1 percent of GDP for the central government balance also
during the upswing, and a nominal fiscal surplus above 1 percent of GDP is expected for this
year. The fiscal authorities have gathered wide support for their self-imposed rule by
successfully explaining to the public the concepts and purpose of the structural target for
fiscal policy. The structural fiscal target is aimed at allowing the automatic stabilizers to
operate throughout the cycle, so as to avoid a pro-cyclical bias that characterized fiscal policy
in the past, and that is a common feature among emerging market economies. Both, fiscal and
monetary policies display high and increasing levels of transparency, as recognized in last
year’s Fiscal ROSC, and this year Monetary ROSC.
7.
As mentioned by the staff, my authorities feel confident that risks to the short and
medium term outlook appear manageable. In particular, the effects of the disruption of natural
gas supplies from Argentina have been contained, and recent news in this respect have been
favorable, thus reducing the moderate impact on output growth and energy costs mentioned in
the report. It is worth noting that the more intensive use of natural gas of recent years added
an element of diversification to Chile’s energy matrix, historically concentrated in
hydroelectric power. The unreliability of the new supply source and the demand pressures
resulting from faster actual and projected economic growth, are prompting the industry to
search for alternative energy sources, including importing natural gas from outside the region,
geo-thermal energy, and bringing forward the coming on stream of future hydroelectric
projects.
8.
Concerns related to the “relatively high” Chilean corporate external debt are founded
in a very partial view of the private sector’s financial position. First, as acknowledged by the
staff, a substantial part of that debt corresponds to companies owned by non-financial
multinationals, of which a significant part is due to their parent’s company. Second, Chile’s
indicators of gross private external debt are below those of advanced economies. Third, the
large accumulation of assets held abroad by Chilean corporations and institutional investors
cannot be ignored when analyzing the private sector’s solvency. If the intention is to study
financial risks, just focusing on gross debt does not provide an overall picture, and therefore
should be complemented with a more comprehensive analysis of the asset-liability
mismatches of private corporations. In this regard, the development of derivatives markets for
exchange-rate risk is reassuring in the sense that corporations have access to hedging
instruments, while regulations on financial intermediaries and the incentives structure of a
floating exchange rate system promotes a more wide-spread use of hedging strategies.

-4Moreover, liquid external assets of the private sector cover a significant portion of their shortterm external liabilities. Finally, international capital markets have continuously improved
their risk evaluation of Chilean corporations, and bond spreads for a representative sample of
them have continued to narrow —from an average of 280 basis points last year, to around 200
basis points on average throughout this year.
9.
The FSAP exercise has been extremely useful. The core message of the FSSA is that
the Chilean financial system is relatively large, sound, well diversified, and resilient to shocks.
The strengths of the banking system and of the supervisory and regulatory institutions were
particularly underscored. The important role played by pension funds and their substantial
accumulation of domestic and external financial assets over the years —which has been
instrumental for the development of the whole financial sector— was also recognized.
10.
Notwithstanding the relatively smooth performance of the financial sector during the
difficult times of the late 1990s and early 2000s, several areas that require strengthening in
order to further improve the efficiency of resource allocation are adequately identified in the
FSSA. The recommendations have been welcomed and work in this regards has been started.
The Central Bank and the SBIF have published a proposal for reforming regulations on
market risk at banks along the lines of the 1996 amendment on the Basle capital accord, and
they are considering the scope of derivative intermediation open to banks. Also, the Central
Bank has recently revamped the payment systems and work continues to improve the
infrastructure for clearance and settlement of securities. Also, the Capital Markets II initiative
—which addresses some of the FSAP recommendations— and another bill that introduces
additional flexibility to the ceilings on lending interest rates by making them more productspecific, have recently been submitted to Congress. Other initiatives that require a more
careful consideration of the legislative work needed for their development and/or more
sophisticated and time consuming technical treatment will follow. Finally, the BCCH will
soon start periodically publishing a Financial Stability Report, so as to enhance surveillance of
the domestic financial market and its interrelations with the international capital markets.
11.
The outstanding performance of the economy during the nineties can be explained in
terms of a sustained process of reforms, institution building, and strengthening of the
macroeconomic policy framework. The contagion from crisis episodes in emerging markets
and the weak global conditions of the turn of the century slowed down the rate of growth
during the last five years. Under the currently supportive external environment, and the
strength of its policy framework and institutional arrangements, Chile is well positioned to
return to a higher growth path. However, the extent of the acceleration going forward is a
matter of debate. The committee of independent experts that generate the parameters used in
the calculating the fiscal structural balance has estimated 4.1 percent as the growth rate of
potential output. Including the absorption of the existing output gap, average growth over the
next 4 years is projected at 5.2 percent. Yet, taking into account recent advances —such as the
free trade agreements signed with major trade partners, structural reforms (capital markets,
civil service, education, health, sanitation, etc.) and the massive effort in infrastructure
building as well as the prospects for a more robust return of capital inflows and foreign
investment which have remained depressed over the last few years— there is room for greater
optimism about the long-term prospects for the Chilean economy.

-512.
Improving the efficiency of the education system is a necessary condition to sustain
higher economic growth. It should be noted however that many of the observed weaknesses
in the quality of education can be attributed to the rapid expansion of the system's coverage.
In addition, several projects aimed at increasing the quality of education are already
underway. In a similar vein, well-focalized social policies continue to be a priority for the
Chilean government, and despite the impressive advancement in poverty reduction over the
last decade, the authorities are aware of the significant pockets of poverty that still remain.
Consequently, my authorities have very ambitious tasks in terms of reducing extreme poverty
and have developed a special and well-focalized program, Chile-Solidario, to increase the
access to social services by marginalized segments of the population, mostly in rural areas. A
more balanced wealth and income distribution is likely to be an outcome of the sustained
implementation of policies aimed at ensuring equal opportunities.
