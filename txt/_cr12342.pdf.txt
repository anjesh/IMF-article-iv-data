STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
December 6, 2012

KEY ISSUES:
The growth outlook is clouded by a stalling recovery in Europe and a
competitiveness gap vis-à-vis partners. Assuming a rapid resolution of the euro area
crisis, the authorities project growth to rebound to 0.8 percent in 2013, against
0.4 percent in the staff’s scenario. The competitiveness shortfall is reflected in loss of
export market share and low profit margins. Despite high unemployment and the open
output gap, core inflation is declining only very slowly, owing to wage inertia.
The authorities are embarked on a path of rapid fiscal consolidation, reflecting
euro area commitments and the need to solidify market confidence. They target a
reduction of the deficit from 4½ percent of GDP in 2012 to 3 percent in 2013, with a
view to reaching a balanced position by 2017. Based on a more conservative growth
outlook, staff projects a deficit of 3½ percent of GDP in 2013. A more measured pace of
fiscal consolidation would have been preferable on cyclical grounds, but market and
euro area imperatives have reduced fiscal space. While planned adjustment over the
medium-term is about evenly divided between revenue and expenditure measures, staff
considers that the already high tax ratio (relative to partner countries) calls for
rebalancing towards more expenditure containment.
Impediments in the functioning of the labor and product markets are at the core of
the competitiveness gap that has built up over time. The planned reduction of labor
costs (through a corporate income tax credit) will improve competitiveness, if supported
by wage moderation. But the key to improved outcomes in terms of growth and
employment lies in reforming the labor market so as to increase the capacity of
enterprise to invest, adapt and create jobs. Discussions under way between social
partners create a unique opportunity to achieve meaningful reforms in this area.
Liberalization in the services sector would enhance the benefits of labor market reform,
but may be difficult to pursue in tandem.
Financial stability concerns, which arose in connection with euro area tensions and
dollar liquidity problems in 2011, have abated considerably. Since 2011, French
banks moved swiftly to strengthen their solvency ratios and funding structures, largely
through external deleveraging. However, banks remain heavily reliant on wholesale
funding, which could be a source of vulnerability in the event of another severe liquidity
or euro area confidence shock. A critical challenge for the French financial system, and
its ability to provide long term financing to the domestic economy, comes from the need
to adapt to international regulatory changes.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. The Economic and Financial Context
1.

While France weathered the 2008 financial and subsequent euro-area crises relatively

well compared to other advanced countries, its recovery has been sluggish. France suffered
smaller output and employment losses than most advanced economies and euro area partners.
However, output and employment remain below pre-crisis levels. Large automatic stabilizers and a
relatively less open economy—than Germany, the UK and, obviously, the smaller European
economies—may have shielded the economy from the full impact of the crises. France may also
have been subject to lesser shocks or less exposed to asset price shocks (see Box 1)

France has become a less open economy over the last decade relative to partners,

reflecting a steady loss of export market share relative to its European peers. The loss of export
competitiveness is reflected in a steady deterioration of the current account balance and a decline in
the openness ratio of 9 percentage points from 2000 to 2010 relative to the euro area average, and
of 24 percentage points relative to Germany.1 While lower openness may have dampened the
inward impact of the crisis through the trade channel, more significantly it limits the economy’s
ability to rebound in the short term and constrains potential growth in the medium term. The loss of
competitiveness is also revealed by a steady narrowing of profit margins. Although some of the
recent decline is likely to be cyclical, the share of capital income in national income has been trailing
behind that of European partner countries.

Box 1. France’s Growth Performance through the Crises of 2008-12
France’s growth performance since 2008—
through both the global financial crisis and the
subsequent euro area sovereign debt crisis—has
been better than most of its European peers, with
real GDP in 2012 projected to be slightly higher
than it was in 2008. In order to put this
observation into context, we ask the following
two questions:

How much of the difference in growth
outcomes was already anticipated in 2008? In
the case of France, the 2008 Fall WEO vintage
projected that real GDP in 2012 would
be 7½ percent higher than in 2008. With
cumulative growth of only ¼ percent over the
period, the forecast error comes to 7¼ percent.
By contrast, Germany was expected to grow by
only around 3¾ percent over the period and, in
the end, the forecast error was very small
(approximately 1 percent). The line drawn
through the chart on the right corresponds to
a 2008 growth forecast of 7.5 percent (equal to
that of France). Countries above the line had a
lower growth forecast, while countries below it
had a higher growth forecast.

Sources: WEO. The unexplained forecast error is computed as the residuals by regressing the forecast
error (defined above) on some economic shocks such as forecast errors (defined in a similar way) on fiscal
consolidation and exports, as well as changes in house prices and bond yields.

To what extent can the forecast error be explained by observable shocks? To answer this question, we
regress the forecast error on four economic and policy shocks: a fiscal shock (measured by the forecast
errors of the structural deficit projection), an external shock (measured by the forecast error of exports), and
two asset price shocks, i.e., changes in the real price of housing and in the sovereign yields.2 The residuals
from this regression should reflect idiosyncratic national factors3. France’s very low regression residual
suggests that France’s forecast error can be largely explained by the observable shocks and its relative good
performance reflects therefore smaller shocks (or lower exposure to asset price shocks) rather than Frenchspecific positive characteristics. By contrast, Slovenia and Italy, for instance, appear to have benefited from
idiosyncratic factors that reduced the impact of the shocks by over 2 percentage points of GDP. At the other
extreme, growth in Malta, Greece and Luxembourg was 3–4 percent lower over the period than can be
explained by the shocks they faced.

2

Asset price shocks are measured as the difference in price (or yield) between now and 2008, on the assumption that
changes in asset prices were unexpected.

3

With a sample of 18 countries (euro 17 plus Denmark) the regression shows a relatively good fit, with an adjusted
2
R of 86 percent.

By contrast, financial integration with the

rest of the world has increased over the last
decade, as French banks moved to the top of the
league in terms of size and global
interconnectedness.4 Four of the 25 largest global
banks (2011) are French. Mostly through increased
wholesale funding, French banks became major
players in investment banking, international credit
and derivative markets. They also expanded their

The current account recorded a

deficit of 1.9 percent of GDP in 2011, driven
by a worsening balance in net exports of
goods. Exports continued to recover but
imports were up by nearly 2 percentage points
of GDP, largely on account of higher
petroleum imports. The current account deficit
in 2012 is projected to be smaller (1.5 percent
of GDP), as a slowdown in import volume
growth should more than offset a softening in real export growth. The surplus in the financial
account in 2011 was marked by a retrenchment in net asset flows, in contrast to previous years. This
evolution was notable in the banking sector, which also shed liabilities (and BIS data suggests that
this has continued in the first half of 2012). France’s net international investment position (IIP)
dropped further in 2011. While the bulk of the negative net IIP is due to the government’s net
liabilities, small net positions in other sectors may mask large gross positions, as with the banking
sector. The IMF’s External Balance Assessment methodology points to relatively small deviations of
the current account and the exchange rate from their estimated equilibrium levels (see Annex I).
7.

Upon taking office in mid 2012, the incoming government endorsed the 2012

and 2013 fiscal commitments of the previous government. The slowing economy had opened
up a gap relative to the previous government’s budget deficit target, which had been based on an
arguably overoptimistic growth assumption. At the same time, market tensions remained high. In
response, the government took broad-based revenue measures equivalent to 0.6 percent of GDP
(on an annual basis), in order to meet the 2012 fiscal deficit target. Achievement of the deficit target
remains subject to uncertainties surrounding the financial performance of the social security
accounts and local governments. As part of its electoral commitments, the incoming government
also lowered the retirement age from 62 to 60 for certain categories of workers, financed through an
increase in social security contributions by up to 0.5 percentage points by 2017.

B. Outlook and Risks
8.

Banking on an early resolution of the euro area crisis, the authorities expected real

GDP growth to bounce back to 0.8 percent in 2013. This significant acceleration is predicated on
an expected improvement of the euro area environment, which would revive exports and, in turn,

is on the optimistic side, but still within a credible range of economic forecasts.

which reflects the assumption that the resolution of the euro area crisis will take time. Tensions in
the euro area are also expected to continue to weigh on confidence and thus on domestic demand
through at least the first half of 2013. In the staff’s scenario, the unemployment rate is projected to
rise further, notwithstanding measures planned by the government to improve job prospects for
new entrants and seniors. The main domestic downside risk to the projection is associated with a
failure of private consumption and investment to rebound as expected in the second half of 2013.

Despite an open output gap, core inflation is projected to decline only very slowly

in 2013. In line with recent trends, nominal wage inflation in the private sector is expected to remain
at around 2 percent in 2013 despite the increase in unemployment. Because of the high minimum
wage and a compressed wage structure, the discretionary increase in the minimum wage decided by

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FRANCE

the government in July 2012 (0.6 percentage points above the increase of the index) is likely to
dampen the effect of labor market conditions on wage formation.5
11.

The authorities also retain a more optimistic medium-term outlook, with average

annual growth projected at 2 percent from 2014 to 2017, against 1.3 percent in the staff’s
scenario. The authorities scenario is based on global growth returning to its pre-crisis level of over
5 percent, i.e., nearly a full percentage point higher than in the Fall 2012 WEO. In line with recent
trends, the staff’s scenario also assumes that real exports of goods and services will grow less than
the export market, but that the gap will close over the medium term.
12.

Moody’s recent sovereign downgrade by one notch (from Aaa to Aa1) appears to have

been largely anticipated and did not trigger any noticeable market reaction. Because banks’
stand-alone ratings (without systemic support) are several notches below that of the sovereign, the
rating action does not carry over to banks. Most banks remain, however, under negative watch by
rating agencies. A downgrade would be potentially costly in terms of their wholesale funding and
their derivative trading owing to higher margin and collateral requirements.
13.

Downside risks lie mostly in the re-emergence of significant euro area tensions (see

Risk Assessment Matrix). Based on staff estimates, a decline of real GDP by half a standard deviation
in the euro periphery relative to the baseline (equivalent to roughly 2 percentage points) would
reduce growth in France by ½ a percentage point in 2013 and 1 percent in 2014.6 The implication of
renewed tensions in the euro area on French sovereign spreads is more ambiguous. The 2012 IMF
Spillover Report shows that the behavior of bond spreads of euro area countries (including France)
vis-à-vis Germany has been dominated by a common component, reflecting perceptions of euro
area-wide risks. Based on this analysis, French yields would be adversely affected by renewed
tensions. This effect could be dampened by the fact that France moved, in 2012, to a (relative) safe
haven status, although this status could be reversed if, in parallel, renewed financial sector tensions
were to set in motion an adverse sovereign-banking nexus.

5

The minimum wage is indexed to the CPI plus half of the annual increase in the real hourly labor wage in industry.
According to a study by the Banque de France, 20–30 percent of minimum wage increases find their way over the
medium term in an increase in the average wage (Cette et al., Banque de France, Document de travail 366,
February 2012).

14.

Financial vulnerabilities stem from the French banking sector’s extensive cross-border

financial linkages and exposure to wholesale funding. French banks have reduced very
significantly their exposures to euro area periphery countries, but exposures to Italy remain
substantial, including through subsidiaries. A worsening situation in the periphery and its
consequences through the area could affect Italy disproportionately and undermine French banks’
ongoing recapitalization plans, and, in the extreme, threaten financial stability. While banks’ funding
structures have improved since 2011 (as discussed below), exposure to wholesale markets remains
high, and margins for quick disposal of non-core assets have shrunk. As reported in the 2012
Spillover Report, European banks identified as having the capacity to create negative spillovers for
all G-SIFIs (as well as all major European banks) include French banks. Spillovers from large systemic
French banks could become active if they were forced into an accelerated retrenchment from
corporate and investment banking, from retail banking in other countries, and from their holdings of
sovereign paper of peripheral euro area countries.7
15.

Faster slowdown of growth in the core euro area and outside of the euro area is also a

risk; as noted above, the expected gradual rebound of domestic demand could also be slower
in coming. While the staff’s scenario accounts for the contractionary effect of fiscal policy, the size
of the fiscal multipliers is itself uncertain, and private demand is also subject to other downside risks.
Trade channels effects of weaker condition in the core euro area would be potentially significant.
However, growth spillover analysis suggests that French output co-moves less with global output
shocks than Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, and Germany, for instance. This may reflect France’s large
automatic stabilizers and less open economy.

Macroeconomic risks related to a correction in real estate prices appear to be

relatively contained.10 The increase in housing prices (over 100 percent in real terms since the
mid 1990s) has been supported by
stronger fundaments (higher
population growth, relatively low
supply of housing, and low household
indebtedness) than in other countries
with rising real estate prices, but also
by tax incentives that have fueled
demand without addressing underlying
supply constraints. There is a
perception of price overvaluation,
especially in Paris (by 10-20 percent at

However, there is no housing glut or household debt overhang that could trigger a sudden price
adjustment. Moreover, stress tests suggest that banks are well placed to absorb the impact of a
possible sizable price adjustment owing to tight underwriting criteria (emphasizing sustainability of
the borrower’s income, not collateral value) and the absence of nonrecourse loans. The impact of a
possible price correction on private demand would also be contained reflecting weak evidence of
wealth effects on consumption.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
17.

Context: the authorities face the four way challenge of a stalling recovery, the constraints on

fiscal policy created by euro area fiscal rules and a rising debt ratio, a competitiveness gap related to
structural rigidities, and the need to preserve financial stability in the face of continued uncertainty.
18.

Objectives: the overarching economic objectives are to contribute to a common solution to

the euro area crisis, and to create conditions for stronger growth, which would not only address
social and employment needs, but would also ease the process of fiscal consolidation and allow the
financial sector to pursue deleveraging in an orderly manner.
19.

Authorities’ policy strategy: the authorities noted that the first order of business for the

President and his government had been to help support crisis resolution in the euro area, including
by sticking to France’s fiscal commitments consistent with the euro area stabilization strategy. With
the risks of an imminent break up largely averted, policy priorities have shifted to the process of
10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FRANCE

forging stronger financial and fiscal integration in the euro area and to domestic structural reforms
to improve competitiveness and raise potential growth. The authorities noted that policies had
taken on board previous Fund advice (see Annex II).

A. Calibrating Fiscal Adjustment
20.

The authorities considered that an ambitious fiscal target in 2013, consistent with their

commitment vis-à-vis the EU, was the anchor of credibility and was needed to reinforce
confidence in the euro area stabilization strategy. To abide by the EU’s Excessive Deficit
Procedure (EDP), France is committed to bring its budget deficit down to 3 percent of GDP in 2013.
To meet this objective, the 2013 budget contains measures equivalent to 1.2 percent of GDP.
Combined with the measures already taken in July 2012, total structural adjustment in 2013 is
estimated by staff at 1.3 percent of (potential) GDP, ¾ of it coming from revenue measures. About
half of the structural adjustment targeted over the next five years (2012 to 2017) would thus take
place in the first year. The authorities explained that such front-loaded adjustment is critical not only
for bringing debt on a sustainable path and thus their policy credibility, but also for the credibility of
the euro area crisis resolution strategy. They considered that any perceived lack of resolve on their
part could lead to an unraveling of confidence and that the risks associated with such a scenario
would vastly outweigh the impact of fiscal consolidation on demand. Market participants also
highlighted the importance of meeting 2013 fiscal target, mostly as reassurance about the direction
of policies. Reflecting the expectation of lower growth, staff projects that the 2013 budget will
deliver a deficit of 3.5 percent of GDP.
21.

Staff took the view that the medium-term balanced budget target was appropriate,

but that, if growth in 2013 were to fall short of the authorities’ assumption, maintaining
the 2013 deficit target unchanged at 3 percent of GDP would move fiscal policy into an overly
pro-cyclical stance, notwithstanding the importance of coordination at the European level.
Even though the current policy stance is already pro-cyclical, staff acknowledged the constraints on
policy choices noted by the authorities (see above). Staff estimates suggest that global fiscal
consolidation plans could already be costing France 1.6 percentage points in foregone growth
in 2013 to 2014—1.4 percentage points of which from domestic consolidation, the rest from
consolidation in partner countries. Similarly, fiscal consolidation in France has potential outward
effects on euro area partners—the most affected country would be Belgium, for which the resulting
cumulative real GDP loss over the period 2012–14 would reach 0.4 percentage points. The
authorities pointed out that fiscal multiplier effects associated with the 2013 budget are likely to be
smaller than average because about 80 percent of the adjustment effort would fall on households in
the top income centile with a low propensity to consume. Under the staff’s scenario, which
converges slightly more gradually toward a balanced budget position in the medium term, the debt
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

FRANCE

ratio would peak at 91 percent of GDP in 2014 and begin declining thereafter. The Debt
Sustainability Analysis (Annex III) suggests that debt dynamics are resilient to most standard shocks,
although not to a severe combined interest rate and growth shock.
22.

The authorities’ originally planned for a 50/50 split between revenue and expenditure

measures over the medium term (2012 to 2017), but have since decided to rebalance the
planned adjustment slightly towards more expenditure containment (in order to finance part of
the planned reduction in labor costs—see below). Under the authorities’ plans, expenditure growth
would thus decline from an average of 1.8 percent per year (in real terms) in 2000 to 2012, to
0.5 percent in 2013 to 2017; and the tax burden would be reduced by 0.3 percentage points of GDP
from its 2013 peak to 2017 (Box 2). Staff pointed out, however, that France had started out with an
already higher tax burden than most of its peers in 2011, and that the measures taken in 2012 and
planned for 2013 would only increase the distance from its peers, with the risk of accentuating
distortions and disincentives.
23.

A more ambitious expenditure effort is also desirable to protect the medium-term

deficit target against the risks that the authorities’ relatively optimistic growth assumption
for 2014 to 2017 will not be realized. The authorities explained that expenditure containment over
the medium term would rest on wage moderation and a stabilization of the number of civil servants
at the central government level, stricter selection of investment projects, and tighter constraints on
local government spending. An inter-ministerial committee (chaired by the PM), charged with
identifying ways to rationalize government functions, should also help set spending priorities, and
thus avoid inefficient across-the-board cuts. Staff remarked that the rapid growth in spending by
local governments, in excess of the transfer of mandates, had already squeezed the room for
maneuver of the central government, and that more adjustment should be expected of them. Also,
the government’s plans envision a gradual closure of the deficit of the social security accounts,
based on regular revisions to pension policy and strict containment of health expenditures, but a
more front-loaded effort to close the structural deficits of the social security funds would be
desirable, if only to counter the risks associated with relatively optimistic assumptions about growth
and employment. On the revenue front, the authorities indicated that they would review more
critically the broad use of tax expenditures and social security exemptions.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Box 2. Medium-Term Fiscal Consolidation
The medium-term fiscal consolidation plan targets a balanced structural budget in 2016
and a steady reduction of the debt-to-GDP ratio starting in 2014. Over the period 2013
to 2017, the Loi de programmation des finances publiques 2012 to 2017 (the medium-term budget
law) projects that the adjustment burden would be roughly equally divided between revenue and
spending measures, but revenue measures are frontloaded whereas expenditures measures are
back-loaded. Following a 1 percentage point increase in 2012, the tax-to-GDP ratio would remain
roughly stable while the containment of expenditures would gradually lower the expenditure-toGDP ratio by 2.7 percentage points of GDP. The subsequent decision to offset the fiscal impact of
the EUR 20 billion cut in labor cost—half by an increase in VAT rates and a new green tax and half
by spending cuts—would reduce the expenditure-to-GDP and tax-to-GDP ratios by 0.2 points of
GDP in 2015 and 0.4 points in 2016 and 2017 leaving the headline deficit trajectory unchanged.
Under staff’s weaker growth projection, reaching a structural balanced budget by the end
of the period requires more aggressive spending containment over the medium term. Real
expenditure growth would need to be lower than projected by the authorities by almost
0.2 percent per year over 2015 to 2017. And compensating for the reduction in social security
contributions would result in a near freeze of expenditures in real terms in 2015 to 2016
compared with a real growth of 0.3 percent in the authorities’ scenario.

Box 3. Transposition into French law of the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and
Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union
In October 2012, through an “organic law,” France aligned its laws to the requirements of
the European Treaty on Stability, Coordination, and Governance (Fiscal Compact). An
organic law ranks, in hierarchy, between the Constitution and ordinary laws. As a result, all Budget
Laws will have to be consistent with both the Constitution and the new organic law.
The organic law establishes:
The medium-term objective of a structural deficit capped at 0.5 percent of GDP.15
The organic law stipulates that the Lois de Programmation des Finances Publiques (LPFP, the
multi-year fiscal laws established as part of the constitutional amendment of 2008) will define
the medium-term structural deficit target and specify the yearly structural deficits to reach it.
The LPFP will also have to present debt-to-GDP dynamics16, and include a floor on new
revenues and a ceiling on expenditures for the State and the Social Security system. As a
result, in case a spending shock breaches the expenditure ceiling, expenditure cuts in other
areas will have to compensate.


 A new fiscal council, the “Haut Conseil des Finances Publiques” (HCPF), to ensure
that the rules are met. Under the new architecture, the HCFP, which is associated with (but
not part of) the Cour des Comptes (Audit Court),17 will provide an independent view on the
appropriateness of the macroeconomic projections underpinning the LPFP, the draft budget
law, and the draft Social Security Finance law18, as well as their consistency with the mediumterm trajectory toward the medium-term objective and with France’s European commitments.
The Conseil Constitutionnel (Constitutional Court) has indicated that it will consider the HCPF’s
views when deliberating on the credibility of the budget law, and thus its consistency with the
Constitution.

A corrective mechanism. If, taking into account the exceptional factors mentioned in the
Treaty, the HCPF identifies that the fiscal outturn deviates from the medium-term trajectory, it
will alert the government. The government will have to explain the reasons for the deviation
and, if the deviation is substantial, it will have to implement corrective measures in the
following year’s Budget Law, at the latest.


15

If the public debt exceeds 60 percent of GDP, 1 percent otherwise. The structural deficit is the structural deficit of the general
government.
16

The LPFP, covering 2012 to 2017, already does so.

17

The HCPF, chaired by the head of the Cour des Comptes, consists of 11 members: five (including the chair) from the Cour
des Comptes, four nominated by Parliament, one by the Conseil économique, social et environnemental (a consultative assembly
representing employers, labor unions, and NGOs), and, ex officio, the head of INSEE (the Statistical and Economic Studies
Agency).
18

The HCPF can, but is not required to, provide a view on the on the growth projections underpinning revised budget laws.

24.

Parliament approved in October 2012 an organic law transposing the requirements of

the EU Fiscal Compact into French law (Box 3). The organic law introduces a fiscal rule in the form
of a medium-term structural deficit target and reinforces the link between annual budget laws and
the medium-term target by requiring budgets to specify the trajectory toward the medium-term
target, as well as corrective mechanisms in the event of deviations from it. It also sets up a fiscal
council with three mandates: (i) to provide an independent opinion on the macro-economic
assumptions underlying the state and social security budgets; (ii) to examine whether budgetary
objectives are consistent with the medium-term fiscal targets of the multi-year fiscal law; and (iii) to
identify deviations from established targets and monitor implementation of corrective actions. The
fiscal council has the requisite independence from the executive branch, but its mandate is more
limited than fiscal councils in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, for instance, in that it will
not produce an independent forecast. The authorities noted that reputational costs (for the
government of deviating from the fiscal council’s opinion on the government’s growth forecast, and
for the fiscal council members of endorsing projections that deviate from independent forecasts)
would enforce greater discipline into the projections, without the costs (in terms of staffing and
overall coherence) of separating the fiscal and macroeconomic projection functions. The staff asked
about the possible conflict of interest between the monitoring and ex-ante evaluation roles of the
fiscal council and the ex-post audit and advisory role of the Audit Court (Cour des Comptes) to which
the fiscal council is associated. The authorities considered that such a risk was minimized by the
broad and politically diverse composition of the fiscal council, which would not be dominated by
Audit Court members.

B. Closing the Competitiveness Gap
25.

The competitiveness gap that has built up over time owes to a range of structural

problems, with impediments in the functioning of labor and product markets at its core. In
July 2012, the government launched two initiatives to improve the functioning of the economy. First,
it mandated social partners to negotiate a broad reform of the labor market by year-end to increase
its flexibility while improving job security. Second, it commissioned a competitiveness report from
Louis Gallois, a leading business executive, to identify the sources of competitiveness loss and
related corrective actions. The Gallois report, released on November 5, highlights high labor costs
(and low profitability) and non-cost factors, such as: the difficulty French SMEs have in accessing
export markets; the inability of French manufacturers to move up the value added chain as
compared, for instance, with German manufacturers; a weak integration between fundamental
research and industrial R&D, despite France’s noted preeminence in the hard sciences; an education
system which still creates mismatches between demand and supply; and less stable relationships
between large enterprises and their supply chain, again as compared to Germany.

Labor market functioning
26.

Discussions centered on the following priorities:
Creating more adaptable work and compensation arrangements at the enterprise level.



National regulations and collective sector agreements have limited the ability of enterprises to
negotiate wage and/or work arrangements that take into account competitive or cyclical
pressures. The authorities remarked that, by precluding negotiated arrangements, these
rigidities have tended to accentuate conflictual labor relations with suboptimal outcomes in
terms of job and capital preservation. These rigidities have also raised the (shadow) cost of labor
over the cycle, and as such limited potential growth. The authorities have called on social
partners to find ways for enterprises under pressure to negotiate more flexible work and pay
arrangements with their employees, while giving employees and their representatives more say
in the early stages of restructuring plans.
Lessening legal and judicial uncertainty of layoffs, and reducing the insider/outsider



divide in the labor market. The uncertainty that weighs on layoffs reflects both the broad work
protection rights afforded by the labor code and the very lengthy and uncertain judicial process
of challenging individual and collective layoffs. This uncertainty has raised the implicit cost of
labor, created disincentives to hire, and promoted reliance on temporary work arrangements.
The authorities acknowledged that this situation has, in turn, aggravated the dual labor market
divide, where workers on temporary contracts (80 percent of new hiring) bear an uneven share
of job uncertainty. Temporary work arrangements also undermine incentives to train and
develop employees, and ultimately productivity growth. Staff analysis suggests that legal
uncertainty over collective dismissals indeed acts as a critical hindrance to competitiveness19. To
address these problems, the government has asked social partners to find ways to make openended contracts more attractive and to

reflect disincentives to work and to retain workers due to the combination of retirement and
unemployment benefits. Employment rates among older workers have begun to increase in the
wake of the 2010 pension reform (increase in the retirement age) and elimination of incentives
for early retirement, but the government also introduced a new incentive scheme that targets
the joint employment of a new worker (trainee) and retention of an older worker (trainer).
However, the more persistent problem is with employment of youth and low-skilled workers.
While the level of the minimum wage (discussed below) is an important constraining factor for
unskilled workers, so are inadequate training opportunities and active labor market policies.
Staff also pointed out that the high replacement rate and long duration of unemployment
benefits undermined incentives to work after a spell of unemployment, and that benefits should
be tightened, especially as labor market conditions improve. The authorities noted that efforts to
improve training and active labor market policies are being stepped up following the merger of
the job placement and unemployment benefits agencies into a single agency (Pôle Emploi).
27.

The authorities were optimistic that social partners would rise to the challenge of

proposing meaningful reforms on all of the above issues. Most parties acknowledged that the
current situation is socially unsustainable and, according to some observers, the legitimacy of labor
unions depends on their ability to be part of a cooperative solution. The government plans to
support the outcome of the negotiations with legislative changes, but has also indicated that, in the
absence of a suitable agreement, it would be willing to move ahead unilaterally.

Labor Costs
28.

There has been much debate on the role of labor costs in the competitiveness gap.

Although labor costs in the economy as a whole appear indeed to be higher than in Germany, the
difference is not so evident in manufacturing, whereas it is much more pronounced in non-tradable
services. Also, price competitiveness, as measured by the CPI-based real exchange rate, does not
point to a serious misalignment. However, the share of capital income in national income, and
relatedly profits as a share of value added, have been declining steadily in France in contrast to
developments in partner countries. This suggests that French enterprises have been able to sustain
price competitiveness by squeezing profit margins, which in turn has limited their capacity (and
incentives) to invest. The open output gap would normally be expected to put downward pressure
on real wages and restore profitability over time. However, this adjustment has been slowed by the
combination of low inflation and stickiness of nominal wage inflation.

29.

To restore the profitability of enterprises, the Gallois report recommended a

competiveness shock in the form of a reduction of employers’ social security contributions of
roughly 1.0 percent of GDP. The report suggested that the reduction be financed through a mix of
expenditure cuts and increases in income and indirect taxes. Staff took the position that:
(i) rebalancing the distribution of national income in favor of capital through the tax system is likely
to have only temporary effects if the measure is not accompanied by deeper structural reforms; and
(ii) the effect risks being eroded even more quickly if it is financed by a shift in the tax burden rather
than a cut in spending, because of the possible impact of higher taxes on wage demands.
30.

The government has taken on board the recommended reduction of social security

contributions, but plans to phase it in over two years starting in 2014. Rather than lowering
social security contributions outright, the government will achieve the same objective through a
corporate income tax credit. The authorities considered that they could not implement the measure
in 2013, because of the adverse demand effects of higher (offsetting) taxes in the current context.
The tax credit is to be financed by a mix of higher indirect taxes and cuts in spending starting
in 2014. It is part of a broader package of measures which include a commitment to greater stability
in the tax system for enterprises, and stronger apprenticeship programs.
31.

The high level of the minimum wage is another impediment to growth and

employment. Because it applies uniformly across all sectors, the minimum wage is generally
recognized as having contributed to the difficult integration of low-skilled and young workers in the
labor force. The government’s decision to boost the minimum wage in July by 0.6 percent above the
normal indexation mechanism, although modest, reversed a policy of strict containment that had
allowed minimum wage increases to drift below average wage growth since 2008. Staff
recommended a policy of wage moderation when it comes to future changes to the minimum wage.
Government programs have helped alleviate the impact of the high minimum wage through special
employment schemes and reductions in social security contributions at the low end of the pay scale
– the latter at a cost of 1 percent of GDP annually. The government has announced that it will
continue to make use of subsidized employment schemes, notably with a target coverage
of 100,000 unskilled youth in 2013. However, the effectiveness of subsidized employment schemes
as a vehicle to durable entry into the labor force has been questioned.

Services Market
32.
Services remain more regulated in France than in most other OECD countries, notably
in professional services and transport. This tends to lead to higher prices for households and
enterprises, owing to lower productivity or higher rents. The impact on prices of the entry of a fourth
mobile phone operator in 2012 illustrates the potential benefits of increased competition. Even
though most services are not themselves exposed to international competition, they are an input for
industries that do compete in international markets. For instance, about one fourth of all inputs
consumed by industry comes from the services sector. Staff analysis suggests that that liberalizing
network services and professional services would have a large positive impact on productivity, and
by implication competitiveness.21 By raising the purchasing power of households, deregulation of
services would also support the labor market reforms discussed above.
33.
The authorities acknowledged the potential benefits of more competition in the
services sector, but indicated that reforms had to be sequenced. France has yet to make
progress on the reforms of consumer services (retail, energy, telecommunication and real estate)
announced as part of the “G20 action matrix.” The authorities explained that, while priority had been
given to labor market reforms, they would continue pursuing reforms on other fronts. Meanwhile,
they have asked the OECD to conduct a study to identify the areas of reform with the greatest
growth payoff.

C. Consolidating Financial Stability
34.
Financial stability concerns, which arose in connection with euro area tensions and
dollar liquidity problems in 2011, have abated considerably. Whereas French banks’ universal
and diversified business model helped them weather the 2008 to 2009 financial crisis relatively well,

their exposure to periphery EU countries and their heavy reliance on wholesale funding caused
significant drops in equity prices and raised concerns about financial stability in 2011. In response,
French banks moved aggressively to strengthen their solvency ratios and funding structures through
retained earnings and disposal of international non-core businesses. The key findings of the FSSA
are discussed in Box 4.

low credit interest rates) through the whole crisis period (2008 to 2012). While lending standards
may have been tightened given the slowdown of the economy, the overall softening of credit
growth in 2012 is generally attributable to a shift in demand rather than supply. However, given
ongoing balance sheet adjustments, domestic credit growth may be constrained in the event of an
upswing in demand. Banks considered that the impact of their external deleveraging had been
muted by the fact that other financial institutions were able to step in quickly into the areas vacated
by them.

Box 4. Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) – Main Findings
The FSSA is based on the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) Update for France, which was
undertaken in January and June 2012. The findings were further discussed with the authorities during
the Article IV consultation mission in October 2012.
The key macro-relevant findings of the FSSA are as follows:


France’s financial system has shown resilience to severe market pressures but faces challenges.

While its structure has contributed to solid profit generation, the crisis exposed the risks posed by the
banks’ size, complexity, and dependence on wholesale funding. The larger banks have been actively
restructuring their balance sheets—moving to more stable sources of funding; reducing their crossborder presence; and building up capital. They remain, however, vulnerable to sustained disruptions in
funding markets and reduced profitability, which would cause delays in meeting capital-raising plans.


The regulatory and supervisory regime for banks, insurance and securities markets, and market

infrastructures is of a very high standard. Areas for improvement include greater de jure independence
of supervisory authorities; disclosure of the capital treatment and related financial interactions within
complex banking groups; a move toward a more economic risk-focused approach to insurance
regulation and supervision; and enhanced supervision of investment service providers and financial
advisors.


French banks, and listed companies more generally, make extensive public financial disclosures

under IFRS, and as a result of bank regulations (Pillar III of Basel II). Nonetheless, disclosure of financial
sector data falls short of best international practice and enhancements would be highly desirable.
Market discipline would benefit from the publication of regular and comparable data on an institutionby-institution basis, as well as detailed official analyses of financial sector developments in France..

Looking forward, banks have

lowered overall risk exposures, but remain
heavily reliant on wholesale funding;
meanwhile they are well positioned to
comply with internationally-set capital
requirements ahead of schedule. Exposure to
high-yield euro area sovereigns has been
reduced by 54 percent (nearly €30 billion)
since 2010, and consolidated banking claims

Reliance on wholesale funding (Percent of total funding)

by 17 percent over the same period. Non-sovereign exposures to high-yield euro area countries are
mainly to the Italian non-financial private sector through French banks’ subsidiaries. Liquidity buffers
have been bolstered, including by making use of the ECB’s Long Term Refinancing Operations
(LTRO). The three largest banks report liquidity and funding buffers of over 100 percent of their
funding needs. However, banks’ ratios are based on less stringent assumptions than the proposed
Basel III liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR). At the same time,
exposure to wholesale market funding remains high overall and could be a source of vulnerability in
the event of another severe liquidity or euro area confidence shock. The FSAP stress tests suggest
that, after one month of stress, several banks would require central bank support in reaction to an
additional shock amounting to a 5 percent withdrawal of wholesale funding22. If faced with renewed
pressures, French banks indicated that they have further margins to dispose of non-core assets
before having to cut into their core lending activities. However such margins have shrunk, and quick
deleveraging could be costly. Given the size of French banks, the realization of severe liquidity or
capital shocks would require a policy response at the European level and, on that score, the
authorities confirmed their desire to move swiftly on the three pillars of a European banking union
(supervision, deposit insurance, and resolution).
37.

A critical challenge for the French financial system, and its ability to provide long term

financing, comes from the need to adapt to international regulatory changes. The main
constraint on the banks’ capacity to provide long-term loans could come from more stringent
regulatory liquidity requirements. At the same time, insurance companies also face incentives to
reduce investments in equity in response to new regulations and accounting standards. The
conjunction of these two factors raises the question of how the financial system (dominated in
France by these two types of institutions) will channel savings to meet the long-term financing
(including equity) needs of enterprises. One avenue would be for banks to move more toward the
originate-and-transfer model of credit, although it is not clear how quickly or easily market
institutions can adapt to this. Another avenue is to increase the deposit base by removing tax
incentives that deflects saving away from banks.

22

Exposure to liquidity shocks is discussed in paragraph 25 of the accompanying FSSA.

28

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FRANCE

38.

The review of the financial taxation of savings envisaged for next year would be the

occasion to realign tax incentives toward long-term saving. Presently, tax incentives benefit life
insurance and short-term regulated savings products, which mostly accrue to public financial
institutions. As a result, deposits accounted for only one third of total bank liabilities at end-2011,
among the lowest in Europe. The government’s decision to double the ceiling on regulated saving
accounts, which are directed to the financing of social housing, will further divert deposits from the
banking sector The effect is expected to be manageable, but staff noted that the constraints on the
supply of social housing were not primarily a lack of financing and that if resources collected
through regulated savings exceed the housing financing need they should be reallocated to banks.
The authorities agreed that tax incentives should favor long-term saving regardless of the
underlying financial instrument, and should not discriminate between financial intermediaries.
39.

In response to the Liikanen Group report, the authorities indicated that they would

move ahead with their own banking reform to separate the retail from the “speculative”
activities of banks. The objective of the reform is to carve out only those activities that do not
significantly contribute to the financing of the economy. In the authorities’ view this means that only
proprietary trading activities should be excluded, while market making activities which are
considered critical to serving corporate clients should remain within the core business of banks.

STAFF APPRAISAL
40.

The growth outlook for France remains fragile owing to weak conditions in Europe

generally, but it is also clouded by a loss of competitiveness relative to its trading partners. As
financial stability risks abate, and with the prospects of a gradual resolution of the euro area crisis,
France’s competitiveness gap will become the main challenge for macroeconomic stability, growth,
and job creation. The loss of competitiveness predates the crisis, but risks becoming even more
severe if the French economy does not adapt along with its major trading partners in Europe,
notably Italy and Spain which, following Germany, are now engaged in significant reforms of their
labor markets and services sectors.23
41.

The challenge for fiscal policy is to pursue consolidation at a pace that balances

cyclical considerations with the need to preserve market confidence in French policies and in
the euro area crisis resolution strategy. The government’s front-loaded adjustment strategy
provides a strong signal of its resolve and enhances credibility which, over time, had suffered from
the persistence of large structural deficits. However, it is also likely to dampen an already uncertain
short-term growth outlook characterized by significant downside risks to demand. On purely cyclical
grounds, a more measured pace of fiscal adjustment would be appropriate, but European and
market imperatives have reduced fiscal space at this juncture. A pickup of growth in 2013 along the
lines expected by the government should permit the measures deployed in the draft 2013 budget to
achieve the government’s fiscal target. By contrast, persistent weakness of economic activity in the
euro area (and in France) should be the occasion to review the speed of fiscal consolidation at the
European level, in order to provide more support to the recovery. Starting in 2014, the organic law
transposing into French law the Fiscal Compact should also enhance the credibility and predictability
of fiscal policy by linking policies to a structural deficit target.
42.

The quality of fiscal adjustment would be enhanced by rebalancing the fiscal effort

toward expenditure containment beyond what is currently envisaged. With rates of taxation
already among the highest in Europe, the ratcheting up of the tax burden in 2012–13 places France
at an additional competitive disadvantage relative to its peers. Stronger containment and
rationalization of public spending is needed at all levels of the public sector. The initiatives taken by
the government to improve the efficiency of public spending are welcome, but will need to be
supported by stronger containment of local government spending, strict adherence to health
spending limits, as well as timely adaptations of the retirement age to preserve the pension system’s
financial balance. The government’s decision to review periodically the efficiency and the rationale
23

Reforms are described in the 2012 Article IV Staff Reports for Italy and Spain, but the reforms have continued since
then in the judicial and, bankruptcy areas (Italy), and product market liberalization (Spain).

of tax expenditures and social security contributions exemptions is also welcome, especially if it is
used to achieve a more efficient tax system based on a broader base and lower rates. The main
policy risk comes from the back-loading of expenditure adjustment, which could prove harder to
realize than the upfront increase in taxes. This places more urgency on defining expenditure
rationalization plans.
43.

The challenge for structural policies is to move the economy closer to the efficiency

frontier while preserving the benefits of France’s inclusive social model. Rebalancing the
distribution of national income toward entrepreneurial income should be part of the strategy, but
cannot be durably achieved solely through the tax system. Wage moderation, notably in terms of
the minimum wage, should also contribute. But the key to realizing more efficient and inclusive
outcomes in terms of growth and employment lies in improving the functioning of the labor market
by increasing the capacity of enterprises to invest and adapt, and strengthening employment
incentives. Discussions under way between social partners create a unique opportunity to achieve
the needed critical mass of reforms. The benefits of labor market reform would be further enhanced
if combined with greater competition in the services sector, which would spur productivity and
redistribute rents to households and sectors that are exposed to international competition.
44.

The French financial system has proven to be resilient and able to react quickly to

vulnerabilities created by the crisis, although its globally systemic banks remain exposed to
international and euro-area financial risks, notably through heavy reliance on the wholesale
funding market. Capital and liquidity buffers are much stronger today. Deleveraging was carried
out by retrenching from investment banking and international trade financing, where other
institutions could fill the gap relatively quickly, without squeezing access to credit. In the event of
renewed financial market tensions, banks should still have margins to dispose of non-core assets,
but at a cost and with likely outward spillovers.
45.

As banks and insurance companies, which are the backbone of the French financial

system, adapt to international regulatory changes, the tax treatment of financial income
should be realigned to support this process. The overhaul of the financial taxation of savings
envisaged by the government should be an important instrument to encourage long-term saving,
regardless of the underlying financial instrument. Distortions created by regulated short term
savings accounts should also be reduced over time.
46.

It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with France be held on the standard

12-month cycle.

Annex I. France: External Assessment
Background—External Developments
The current account recorded a deficit of 1.9 percent of GDP in 2011, driven by a worsening balance in
net exports of goods. Exports continued to recover but imports were up by nearly two percentage
points of GDP, especially on account of petroleum imports. The surplus in the financial account
in 2011 was marked by a retrenchment in net asset flows, including in the banking sector (which also
shed liabilities), in contrast to previous years. The balance of payments recorded a small deficit.
France’s net international investment position (IIP) dropped further. While the bulk of the negative net
IIP is due to the government’s net liabilities, small net positions in other sectors may mask large gross
positions, as with the banking sector.
1.

Current account developments in 2011. The current account in 2011 recorded a deficit of

1.9 percent of GDP, driven by a worsening balance in net exports of goods. Notwithstanding the
continuation in the recovery of exports of goods since 2009, imports in 2011 jumped by nearly
two percentage points of GDP, nearly half of it due to higher petroleum prices. The improvement in
the balance on services continued in 2011, partly thanks to gains in the travel sector. The income
balance remained in surplus thanks to net contributions from employee compensation and direct
investment.

Developments in the financial account. The financial account ended 2011 with a surplus of

2.9 percent of GDP, including a small reduction in reserve assets (0.3 percent of GDP). In contrast
with previous years, the surplus in 2011 was marked by a net retrenchment in net asset flows of
some 1.6 percent of GDP (4.9 percent of GDP when direct investment is excluded), led by the
banking sector and other non-public sector. Net external liability flows were still positive but these

have been declining and turned negative in the second half of 2011. The evolution of external
liabilities was also dominated by the banking sector, where net external liabilities fell by 7.3 percent
of GDP. Taken together, the retrenchment in external assets and liabilities accelerated in the second
half of 2011, with net external asset claims abroad falling by US$257 billion and net external
liabilities by US$196 billion (9.3 and 7.1 percentage points of 2011 GDP respectively).

investments, and financial derivatives). The bulk of France’s net negative position is due to the
government’s net liabilities which have been accumulating gradually over 2010 to 2011. Again, small
net positions may mask large gross positions. This is the case for the banking sector, which at the
end of 2011 had a net position of -0.4 percent of GDP but gross assets and liabilities of 80.8 percent
of GDP and 80.4 percent of GDP, respectively (excluding any outstanding direct investment).

Incidentally, the net IIP of banks improved by 6.3 percentage points of GDP compared to 2010, as a
result of a reduction in assets by 11.8 percentage points of GDP and in liabilities by 18.1 percentage
points.

Developments in the real exchange rate. France’s real effective exchange rate (on CPI

basis) depreciated by about 2.8 percent from end-2010 through June 2012, compared with a
depreciation of 3.9 percent for the entire Euro Area. Measured over the same period, the real
exchange rate in terms of unit cost of labor (UCL) depreciated by 0.9 percent, compared with a
depreciation of 2.3 percent for the Euro Area as a whole.

“norms” (in the order of 1 percent of GDP and 3 percent, respectively), especially when viewed from a
medium-term perspective. Nevertheless, the gradual deteriorations in the current account balance and
international investment position over the last decade point to a competitiveness problem. Structural
reforms to reduce rigidities in the labor and product markets, promote innovation, and create
favorable business conditions could help restore competitiveness and improve the current account
balance.

This section assesses the level of the current account and real exchange rate. The

external assessment uses the External Balance Assessment (EBA) methodology which is being
developed by the IMF; the EBA is the successor to the CGER methodology and was first introduced
in the 2012 Pilot External Sector Report. Like its predecessor, the EBA methodology consists of three
complementary approaches: the current account method, the real exchange rate method, and the
external sustainability method (see Box below). The EBA results discussed in this section are based
on an update using (WEO) data for Fall 2012.

External Balance Assessment (EBA) methodology
The EBA consists of three complementary methods: the regression-based current account and
real exchange rate methods, and the model-free external sustainability method.
The current account and real exchange rate approaches use the same conceptual model, one
being quantity based and the other one price based, so the discussion focuses on the current
account method. The starting point is a regression model that explains the current account (“ca”,
in percent of GDP) in terms of non-policy variables (“X”), policy variables (“P”), and a residual (“ε”).
The non-policy variables capture determinants such as demographics, growth, and cyclical
influences. The regression model has four policy variables: fiscal policy (the cyclically-adjusted
fiscal balance), social protection (proxied by public health spending as a percentage of GDP), the
presence of capital controls, and foreign exchange intervention (change in reserves). Many
variables are expressed in terms of deviations from world averages for multilateral consistency,
and some allow for interaction terms.
The current account is decomposed into a current account “norm”, which uses the estimated
current account from the regression model but with the policy variables set at recommended
levels (denoted P*), and the current account “gap”. This gap is the sum of the contribution from
policy variables deviating from their recommended levels and the regression residual. Formally:

The recommended policy level for the cyclically-adjusted fiscal balance is obtained from country
desk teams; for social protection it is taken from a regression benchmark; for capital controls, it is
obtained by taking the smaller of either the country’s value or the average level of the capital
controls measure, and for the change in reserves, it is either the observed change in 2012, if the
overall reserves level was deemed adequate, or zero, if reserves were in excess of a range deemed
adequate.
The external sustainability method calculates a current account gap as the difference between the
medium-term current account and the current account which stabilizes net foreign assets (NFA) to
GDP (“nfa”) at a benchmark level. The medium-term current account is the WEO level
projected 2017, the growth rate (“g”) is the medium-term nominal growth rate, and for most
countries the benchmark NFA/GDP is set at the 2010 level, with the latter taken from the External
Wealth of Nations database. The NFA-stabilizing current account is then given by

Current account method. The current account approach suggests a current account gap

equal to -0.6 percent of GDP in 2012. This is the result of the difference between a current account
norm (when policy variables are at recommended values) of -1.1 percent of GDP and the realized
current balance of -1.7 percent of GDP. The current account gap results from two parts: policy gaps
(that is, actual policies deviating from recommended policies) contributed -1.2 percentage points of
GDP, while the regression residual (that is, the part not explained by the regression model)
contributed 0.6 percentage points of GDP. The policy gap is mostly explained by actual spending on
social protection being significantly higher than the benchmark “recommended” estimate.

Real exchange rate method. The real exchange rate method suggests a real exchange rate

gap of -3 percent in 2012, that is: a real appreciation of 3 percent would close the gap with the
estimated real exchange rate, evaluated at recommended policies. This is the net result of a
regression residual contributing -6 percent and policy gaps contributing +4 percent.

Consultation and Authorities’ Response
Fund Recommendations

Policy Actions
Fiscal Policy

Prepare contingency measures in
case growth outcomes fall short of
expectations

Each downward revision of projected economic growth was accompanied
by new fiscal measures in order to meet the fiscal targets.

Enact a fiscal rule

A fiscal rule was introduced in the fall 2012 as part of the transposition
into French law of the European Fiscal Compact.

Cap the autonomous spending of
local governments and social security

To contain local government spending, financial transfers from the state
to the local governments are frozen in 2012 and 2013 and will be cut
in 2014 and 2015. Policy measures reduced the growth rate of social
security spending (from 3.6 percent in 2010 to 3.2 percent in 2011 and to
a projected 2.8 percent in 2012).

Deepen the reforms of the pension
and health care systems

The implementation of the 2010 pension reform was accelerated by one
year in November 2011. However, in July 2012, the increase of the
retirement age from 60 to 62 was eliminated for some workers and the
cost was covered by an increase in social contributions of up to
0.5 percent by 2017.
Financial Sector Policy

Swiftly raise banks capital levels, with
the aim of meeting Basel III
requirements by 2013/14.

French banks are well positioned to comply ahead of schedule with
internationally-set capital requirements. Some banks already meet the
Basel III capital ratios.
Structural Reforms

Keep real wage increase in line with
productivity improvements

Wage moderation continues to be applied for civil servants. However,
in 2012, the government decided to increase the minimum wage by more
than required by the indexation formula.

Increase labor force participation

The pension reforms and the elimination of incentive for early retirement
have increased the participation of seniors in the labor market.

Foster competition in the services
sector

The adoption of a law to increase competition in consumer services
committed as part of the G20 has been postponed. A fourth mobile
operator entered the market in January 2012. 4G licenses were allocated
in December 2011 and increased competition.

Modernize the tax and benefit
system

The various fiscal packages adopted in 2011 and 2012 rely on tax
increases (some of them temporary) but do not modernize or reform the
tax system.

Annex III. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Due to the combined effect of low growth and large fiscal deficits, the debt-to-GDP ratio increased
from about 64 percent on the eve of the crisis to about 90 percent in 2012.Reducing of the debt ratio
over the medium term has become a key objective of the authorities’ policy. Under staff projections,
which integrate the authorities’ announced fiscal measures, the debt-to-GDP ratio would peak in 2014
and decline thereafter. The path of the debt ratio is particularly vulnerable to growth and interest rate
shocks.
Background


Debt ratio. The combined effect of low
growth over several years and the
persistence of high fiscal deficits (due to
the impact of large automatic stabilizers
and of the fiscal stimulus) have increased
the debt-to-GDP ratio by
25.7 percentage points in five years to
almost 90 percent in 2012. Part of the
increase is also due to the financial
support to other Euro area countries1,
which is projected at 2.5 percent of the
GDP in 2012.2 Under the authorities’
scenario, the debt ratio would start
declining as early as 2014. Under staff
projections, the ratio would start declining
only in 2015.



Debt service. Owing to the sharp decline in interest rates, the rising debt has had a limited
impact on the debt service. Interest payments account for 2.6 percent of GDP, the same level as
in 2006 when the debt-to-GDP ratio was 25.8 percentage point lower.

Scenario analysis
 Baseline (See Table 1). Staff projects that the debt-to-GDP ratio will peak at 91.3 percent
in 2014 and then decline to about 84½ percent in 2017. Interest payments would remain at their
low level of 2.5 percent of GDP because: (i) fiscal consolidation leads to a primary surplus
starting in 2015; and (ii) given the maturity structure of the debt (average maturity of just over
7 years as of end September 2012), the projected increase of market interest rates starting
in 2014 passes through slowly to implicit interest rate and the budget. A 100 basis point shock
to all (short and long) interest rates is estimated to increase debt payment by only 0.1 percent of
GDP.

Four scenarios are used to evaluate the sustainability of debt and the vulnerability of shocks.


Slow recovery scenario. Under this scenario, real GDP is assumed to contract in 2013 by
0.5 percent and to increase only gradually thereafter to 1 percent in 2017. As a result, the debtto-GDP would increase to 95 percent in 2017, despite the implementation of the fiscal measures
assumed in the baseline. The lower growth scenario could result from the combination of several

this scenario, reflecting the slow pass
through of interest rates on the budget, the debt ratio would peak in 2015 (2014 in the baseline)
at 93.8, and would decline afterwards, but would still be above 90 percent in 2017.



Fiscal policy slippage scenario. In this scenario, difficulties in containing spending as planned
are assumed to raise primary expenditure by about 1 percent of GDP above the level projected
in the baseline starting in 2013. Assuming everything else constant, the debt to GDP ratio rises
to 91.8 percent in 2016 before declining and coming back in 2017 close to its 2012 level.

Combined growth and interest rate. This scenario, which combines the interest rate and
growth shocks described above, could potentially arise in the event of renewed stress in the

Summary: The report found that France has achieved a high level of fiscal transparency and has
introduced a number of improvements in coverage and presentation of fiscal information. Notable
areas of progress include the development in the final accounts publication to include more
complete information on government assets and liabilities as well as disclosure of contingent
liabilities. Accounting standards have been changed to reflect accruals principles in a number of
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

areas, and these standards are clearly explained. The staff suggested that further steps could be
taken to identify and report quasi-fiscal activities in the budget presentation, provide a more
consolidated picture of fiscal activity outside the appropriation process, and improve the
reconciliation of stated policies with outcomes at the general government level.
These issues have been addressed in the Loi organique aux lois de finance (LOLF), which has become
fully effective on January 1, 2006. In addition to the annual appropriations, the first multi-annual
fiscal framework law was adopted in January 2009, and contains fiscal objectives for the
period 2009–12. The budget is organized along missions and provides details on the level of
appropriations for each mission and performance indicators by which the expected results of the
mission will be assessed ex post. The State Audit Office has been given the new assignment of
certifying the public accounts, and implementation of accruals basis accounting has been confirmed.
Parliamentary oversight powers have been strengthened.

Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies—Update

IMF Country Report
No. 02/248, 11/13/02

Summary: The 2000 ROSC noticed that transparency of financial policies is accorded a high priority
by all financial agencies assessed, and they are in observance of the good practices of the Code of
Good Practices on Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies. The major agencies disclose their
objectives, their legal and institutional frameworks, and have open processes of policymaking and
regulation. The principles of transparency are observed by dissemination of relevant information to
the public and in the agencies’ arrangements for internal conduct, integrity, and accountability.
However, the staff noted that the framework for supervision and regulation applicable to mutual
insurance firms is not as well defined and suggested to improve its transparency. The transparency
of monetary policy was not assessed by the Fund team as the Banque de France is a member of the
European System of Central Banks and no longer conducts independent monetary policy.
Subsequently, the framework for supervision and regulation applicable to a specific group of mutual
insurance firms was modified in a number of steps. In August 2003, legislation created a single
4

FRANCE

supervisory body, the Commission de Contrôle des Assurances, Mutuelles et Institutions de
Prévoyance (CCAMIP) by merging the regular insurance supervisor (CCA) and mutualities’ supervisor
(CCMIP). Coordination with the banking sector supervisors was strengthened and the powers of the
supervisory authorities extended.

Summary: The report found that France is in observance of the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS). In particular, the mandate of INSEE and the Banque de France for the production
of the six macroeconomic datasets is clearly defined, with the reporting burden and the
confidentiality provisions given special consideration notably through the CNIS. Professionalism is
central to the statistical operations of the two institutions, internationally and/or European accepted
methodologies are generally followed, the degree of accuracy and reliability of the six datasets is
remarkable, statistics are relevant and provided on a timely basis, and they are accessible to the
public.
The report made a number of suggestions for further improvements: the responsibility of INSEE as
the producer of government finance statistics should be clarified; data sharing between the Banque
de France and the rest of the French statistical system improved; classification and valuation
methods in balance-of-payments statistics reviewed; consistency between the current account of the
balance of payments and the goods and services account in the national accounts improved; the
timing of revisions in the quarterly and annual national accounts aligned; and identification of data
production units of INSEE facilitated.
France continues to implement several of the 2003 ROSC Data Module recommendations, including
by promoting a broader understanding of statistical data revisions, making greater use of firm-level
data to improve the measurement of changes in stocks, and intensifying work on portfolio
investment income with the objective of starting to record those transactions on an accrual basis.

Standards and Codes

No. 05/186, 06/08/05

Summary: The report concluded that France’s financial sector is strong and well supervised. No
weaknesses that could cause systemic risks were identified. The strength of the system is supported
by the financial soundness indicators and the strong conformity to the supervisory and regulatory
standards approved by the Basel Committee, IAIS, IOSCO, FATF, and CPSS. The degree of
observance of the transparency code is high in all relevant areas. The French banking sector has
been modernized and restructured over the past two decades and is well capitalized. Systemic
vulnerabilities in the important insurance sector are well contained. Securities markets are large and
sophisticated.
Notwithstanding the strengths of the French financial sector, a number of issues emerged from the
FSAP, including (i) concentration in banking may have reached a point where further consolidation
could intensify concerns over the scope for collusion and long-term stability where many banks
could be considered “too big to fail;” (ii) banks’ large and growing portfolios of fixed-rate residential
housing loans could represent a longer-term risk in the event of large increases in funding costs
and/or a significant fall in real estate prices; (iii) some administered savings schemes and other
policy measures give rise to costs and impede financial market innovation. These schemes are not
well targeted to achieve intended social goals and are not well aligned with current priorities, such
as strengthening the pension system; (iv) the banking system’s rapid accumulation of capital
strengthens banks’ resilience.
This accumulation is harder to control for mutual banks, given their legal restrictions on
remuneration of their members. And, for all banks, it could encourage expansion through expensive
takeovers and risky new ventures; (v) the supervisory system of the financial sector is composed of
specialized segments. Coordination mechanisms need to be further adapted. Additional steps
6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FRANCE

should be considered in the future as cross-sectoral financial groups become more prevalent; (vi)
the consolidation of the French stock and futures markets with others in Europe has increased the
importance of effective cooperation across national jurisdictions. Moreover, the authorities face the
challenge of adjusting to and effectively implementing the significant regulatory overhaul that took
place in late 2003; and (vii) the infrastructure for the clearing and settlement of payments and
securities is generally sound and modern. However, there is some room for improvement in the
clearing and settlement of retail payments and securities, where the multilateral netting systems lack
fully adequate safeguards to ensure timely settlement in case of default.

ANNEX II. FRANCE: STATISTICAL ISSUES
The economic database is comprehensive and of high quality, and data provision to the Fund is
adequate for surveillance. The authorities regularly publish a full range of economic and financial
data, and calendar dates of main statistical releases are also provided. France subscribes to the
Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard. The transmission of data in electronic form from INSEE
(Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques) and the profusion of data from various
institutions (Banque de France, INSEE, ministry of finance, ministry of labor and solidarity) have
helped to build an infrastructure, in which all data can be easily accessed through the Economic
Data Sharing System. A data ROSC mission conducted an assessment of the statistical system in
March 2003, and the report was published in October 2003. A factual update to the main report was
published in November 2004.
France’s monetary and banking statistics methodology conforms with the European Central Bank
framework, which provides comparable details as the Standardized Report Forms developed by STA.
Statistics for International Financial Statistics on banking institutions and monetary aggregates are
prepared on a monthly basis and are timely. Monetary data are also disseminated in the quarterly
IFS Supplement on monetary and financial statistics. France follows the European System of
Integrated Economic Accounts 1995 (ESA95). Data for GDP and its expenditure components are
available from 1978 onwards. Both annual and quarterly accounts provide reliable information,
although estimates from the two accounts differ slightly before the quarterly accounts are revised to
be aligned to the annual ones. In 2005, national accounts estimates were rebased to 2000 prices.
Government finance statistics have been strengthened recently. Both central and general
government data are presented in a more comprehensive fashion than previously and the data
for 2006 and 2007 also reflect the various impacts of recent budgetary reform. Although the source
data is collected by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, INSEE is principally responsible for the
compilation and dissemination of fiscal data in a framework that is consistent with ESA95. INSEE’s
website has recently been enhanced; in particular, it includes expenditure tables and government
revenues by subsector (central government, miscellaneous central government agencies, local
governments, and social security administration).
Balance-of-payments statistics should be interpreted with caution, given large errors and omissions.
Greater coherence between the external current account and the rest of the world account in the
national accounts is needed. In this regard, work with promising early results has been undertaken
on the transportation account.

International Monetary Fund

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with France
On December 20, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with France.1
Background
The growth outlook for France remains fragile reflecting weak conditions in Europe. While market
tensions have recently eased, the path towards a resolution of the euro area crisis remains
uncertain and fiscal consolidation throughout Europe will continue to depress demand. In this
environment, growth is expected to slow markedly from 1.7 percent in 2011 to 0.2 percent
in 2012, and to recover only very gradually to 0.4 percent in 2013. With job creation remaining
subdued, unemployment is expected to rise further.
The recovery of the French economy is also hampered by a loss of competitiveness which is
reflected in a steady loss of export market share and low profit margins relative to European
partners, which in turn affects the ability of enterprises to invest and innovate. The
competitiveness gap owes largely to impediments in the functioning of labor and product markets

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

(especially services) accumulated over time. To begin to address these problems, the
government has announced a reduction of employers’ social security contributions (to reduce
labor costs), and has indicated that it would seek to make the labor market more adaptable based
on the result of ongoing negotiations between the social partners.
The sizable fiscal consolidation which started in 2010 is continuing. The overall budget deficit is
projected to come down from 7.5 percent of GDP in 2009 to 4.5 percent in 2012. The 2013
budget targets a further reduction of the deficit to 3 percent of GDP, with a view to reaching a
balanced budget position over the medium term. Adjustment is heavily frontloaded and about
equally divided (over the medium term) between revenue and expenditure measures. Based on
the IMF’s more conservative growth outlook, the 2013 budget would result in a deficit of
3.5 percent of GDP.
Financial stability concerns, which arose in connection with euro area tensions and dollar liquidity
problems in 2011, have abated considerably. French banks have moved aggressively to improve
their solvency ratios and funding structures; and they are well positioned to comply ahead of
schedule with internationally-set capital requirements. However, banks remain heavily reliant on
wholesale funding, which could become a vulnerability in the event of renewed market stress.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the resilience of the French economy in withstanding relatively well
the euro area crisis and enjoying a safe haven status. They noted, however, that economic
growth remains sluggish and the near-term outlook is subject to downside risks. The main
challenge going forward would be to further strengthen the recovery, while addressing the
competitiveness gap vis-à-vis trading partners and safeguarding financial stability. In this context,
Directors underscored the need to properly calibrate fiscal policy and remove structural rigidities
that constrain competitiveness and growth.
Directors commended the authorities for their commitment to fiscal discipline in line with the euroarea stabilization strategy, and for the transposition of the EU Fiscal Compact into French law.
They noted that the adoption of the fiscal responsibility law and creation of the Fiscal Council
would strengthen credibility by anchoring fiscal policy to a balanced position over the medium
term. Many Directors stressed that adherence to the EU’s fiscal target in 2013 would be crucial to
preserve credibility and market confidence, and advised that contingency measures be prepared
should downside risks materialize. Other Directors encouraged the authorities to refrain from
additional fiscal tightening in the event of slower-than-expected growth in 2013. Directors called
for a rebalancing of fiscal adjustment over the medium term toward additional expenditure
containment in a growth-friendly manner, stressing the adverse supply side effects of the high tax
ratio.

3

Directors underscored the need to address the competitiveness gap through deep labor and
product market reforms. They welcomed the authorities’ recent decision to lower social security
contributions, and recommended wage moderation as a supporting measure. They also
welcomed the ongoing negotiations among social partners to improve the functioning of the labor
market, and encouraged the authorities to move forward with the ambitious labor market reform.
Directors also observed that greater competition in the services sector would help lower
production costs and enhance the benefits of the labor market reform. They called on the
authorities to open the services sector to more competition, while acknowledging the need for
careful sequencing of the various reforms.
Directors noted the Financial System Stability Assessment’s findings that the French financial
system has been resilient to shocks and that financial stability risks have receded. They
commended the authorities’ strong regulatory and supervisory regime, and welcomed moves to
boost financial oversight further, including at the European level. Directors welcomed the rapid
improvements in bank capitalization and funding structures in the aftermath of the crisis.
Nevertheless, they observed that banks remain exposed to the risk of financial stress owing to
their still-significant reliance on wholesale funding and exposure to periphery euro-area countries.
To stimulate deposit mobilization by banks, Directors encouraged further tax reform to create a
level playing field and remove disincentives against bank deposits.
