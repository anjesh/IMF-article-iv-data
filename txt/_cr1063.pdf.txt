I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND STAFF APPRAISAL1
1.
The authorities’ actions have helped to stabilize the financial sector and halt the
economic downturn. The Belgian economy was hit hard by the global financial crisis and
economic downturn. In response, the authorities took measures to support the financial sector
and let the automatic fiscal stabilizers operate freely while implementing a moderate stimulus
plan. But the recovery is expected to be slow and fragile. At the same time, ground has been
lost in addressing the high public debt and public spending pressures related to population
aging, and in strengthening competitiveness and labor market participation. The political
situation remains complex and the June 2009 regional elections have strengthened political
parties that are not part of the federal coalition. With a crowded election calendar over the
next years, this complicates the authorities’ efforts to tackle the medium-term challenges
facing the country in the areas of public finances and structural reforms.2
2.
The near-term outlook is challenging. Real GDP is expected to have dropped by
about 3 percent in 2009, and only a gradual recovery is projected for 2010. The
unemployment rate would continue to rise in 2010 and inflation pressures are expected to
remain subdued. Uncertainty to the outlook is high but risks appear broadly balanced. The
dislocation from the crisis lowered potential growth in 2009-11, in addition to the downward
impact due to demographic factors.
3.
The main post-crisis challenges faced by the Belgian authorities are to prepare
for an orderly exit from the crisis measures as the recovery gains strength while at the
same time laying the ground for high and sustained growth over the medium term. It is
particularly important to take early action to strengthen financial stability, restore fiscal
sustainability, and improve the functioning of labor and product markets to boost
competitiveness and economic growth.
4.
Helped by massive public intervention, the banking sector has stabilized but its
financial situation remains fragile and its supervision needs to be strengthened. Bank
recapitalization and balance sheet repair remain important while targeted liquidity support
needs to continue in the near future. Moreover, Belgian banks remain vulnerable to potential
spillovers from mature markets and emerging Europe. The risk of a creditless recovery is a
cause for concern although this is mitigated by the public support and ongoing bank
restructuring. Hence, credit to the economy should be closely monitored. Exit from the
emergency support to the financial sector should take place gradually to avoid adverse

market reactions and a credit squeeze. The initiated reorganization of the Belgian supervisory
authority is welcome and the authorities should continue to strongly support enhanced
international cooperation in regulatory reform and coordination of exit policies.
5.
The financial crisis and the economic downturn threaten the medium-term
sustainability of public finances already under pressure from a rapid rise of agingrelated spending. The government’s new Stability Program aims appropriately to achieve a
balanced budget by 2015 to avert unsustainable public debt dynamics. The intergovernmental
burden-sharing agreement for 2009-10 and the planned agreement for 2011-12, along with
the first multi-year fiscal framework are welcome first steps but leave important decisions,
including a comprehensive fiscal federalism reform, open until after the 2011 federal
elections. While the 2010 budget strikes the right balance between initiating the fiscal
consolidation and supporting the recovery, additional measures are needed to achieve the
deficit targets for 2011 and beyond, including by reversing most of the fiscal stimulus
measures after 2010. Post-crisis fiscal consolidation will require efforts at all government
levels and social security. The adoption of a rule-based fiscal framework would help to
increase the credibility of the consolidation efforts.
6.
Structural reforms remain crucial to improve competitiveness and boost growth.
In view of declining export shares, there remains a need to moderate wage increases,
strengthen competition and enhance the mobility of resources across sectors. There is also a
pressing need to raise the low Belgian employment rate, by both reabsorbing the unemployed
and raising labor market participation, especially among senior workers.
7.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the regular
12-month cycle.
II. DEEP RECESSION AND CHALLENGING OUTLOOK
A. Severe Recession in 2009
8.
Hit by the financial crisis and the collapse in world trade, the Belgian economy
experienced an abrupt and severe contraction in the last quarter of 2008 and the first
half of 2009. Sizeable financial wealth losses of households and non-financial corporations
contributed to plummeting consumer confidence and business sentiment. The serious
problems in the financial sector also led to a tightening of credit conditions. Private
consumption fell despite gains in real disposable income, the latter in part due to lower
inflation. Exports contracted rapidly, reflecting the sharp drop in world trade and, given the
importance of intra-EU trade, spillover effects from the slump in the Euro area. As a result,
private investment was significantly scaled down and firms sharply reduced their inventories.

largely below their pre-crisis levels. Real GDP started to increase again in the third quarter as
the recession in partner countries is bottoming out, financial market conditions were
improving, and firms began rebuilding some of their depleted inventories. For 2009 as a
whole real GDP is expected to have contracted by about 3 percent.

Unemployment is heading upwards. The recession has brought an end to the

activity levels and job creation.
B. Outlook and Risks
10.
The recovery is expected to be gradual and tepid, with real GDP growth forecasted
at slightly above 1 percent in 2010 and to increase to almost 2 percent over the medium term.
Exports are likely to pick up in 2010 as global activity would gain strength, although the
expansion in Belgium’s main trading partners is likely to remain sluggish while relatively
high wage costs and supply rigidities remain a constraint on export performance. In addition,
as the level of inventories has fallen sharply, some further restocking could take place.
However, a rebound in private consumption and investment will take some time. The
considerable wealth losses due to the financial crisis, the ongoing rise in unemployment, and
the deterioration in the fiscal position are likely to induce a further increase in the
households’ savings rate and slow consumption.3 Also, the very low rate of capacity
utilization and tightened financing conditions would induce firms to postpone new
investments. The authorities project a stronger recovery with growth exceeding 2 percent by
2012, mostly driven by a stronger rebound in domestic demand. In light of the fiscal

coefficient: -0.8), supporting the hypothesis that Belgian households display Ricardian behavior.

7
consolidation program (see Section IV), staff considers this rather optimistic. Unemployment
would increase to above 9 percent in 2010. The gradual strengthening of domestic demand
would raise GDP growth above its potential rate while staff expects the output gap to narrow
gradually over the medium term.
11.
Lower energy and food prices since mid-2008 have brought inflation sharply
down with a modest inflation risk going forward. Headline inflation dipped into negative
territory in early 2009 due to the base effects from substantial declines in energy prices.
Annual core inflation remained above 1 percent and is higher than in the Euro area, partly
reflecting the impact of automatic wage indexation. Inflation pressures are expected to
remain subdued in the period ahead, even once the energy and food price base effects
dissipate, due to the weak outlook for growth and employment.

12.
The outlook is unusually uncertain and risks are broadly balanced. On the
upside, the global monetary easing, fiscal stimulus, and the waning of financial market
turbulence would strengthen foreign demand. Stronger recoveries in partner countries, in
particular in the Euro area, would speed up Belgian economic growth. On the downside, the
public support of the financial sector and the fiscal impact of the downturn have significantly
increased the public debt ratio, which could trigger adverse market reactions and dampen
growth. Moreover, a backlash from the financial crisis cannot be ruled out because of the still
strained capital positions and risky exposures in the banking sector. Although thus far the
slowdown in lending appears in line with lower demand, credit may not be able to fully
expand with the demand from firms and households as the recovery gains strength.

The risk of a further house price correction remains considerable but the impact
on the real economy will likely be limited. Real house prices doubled over the past decade
and were estimated to have been overvalued by some 15-20 percent compared to
fundamentals in 2007.4 House prices stabilized in 2008 and have fallen by about 8 percent in
2009. The proportion of household wealth invested in housing has increased since 2000, but
remains considerably less than that in France, the U.K., and the Netherlands. The impact of a
further price correction on the real economy is likely to be mitigated by the relatively low
indebtedness of households and conservative lending practices.5 Mortgages tend to be fixed

Refinancing products are uncommon making a significant adverse impact on consumption
less likely. In addition, while construction activity has fallen in 2009, the sector’s share in
GDP has been stable at around 5 percent, below the European average.
C. External Developments and Competitiveness Issues
14.
The small current account deficits in 2009-10 are expected to be temporary.
Belgium’s highly open economy has been significantly affected by the global downturn and
the sharp drop in net exports during 2008-09 came on top of an already weakening export
performance. Accordingly, the national saving-investment balance turned negative, reflecting
a large increase in the overall government deficit that is partly offset by a rise in net savings
of the private sector. Exports are expected to pick up again from 2010 onwards, in line with
the recovery in global trade. With a more sluggish expansion of domestic demand and
imports, the foreign contribution to growth would become positive again. In view of the
persistent fiscal deficits, however, the current account surpluses projected over the medium
term would be smaller than during the pre-crisis period.

Competitiveness issues remain a constraint on the export performance of the
Belgian economy. Estimates based on the CGER methodologies suggest that the real
exchange rate is broadly in equilibrium. However, developments in real effective exchange
rates based on unit labor costs (ULC) continue to point to a competitiveness gap with respect
to the key trading partners, especially Germany. This gap is due, in part, to the relatively high
wage growth in Belgium—owing to the

D. Consequences of the Crisis for Potential Growth
16.
The financial crisis and the economic recession will have a significant adverse
impact on the Belgian economy’s growth capacity. The banking crisis and the collapse of
global trade will compound the long-term slowdown of potential growth reflecting the
impact of demographic factors, notably population aging. Trade and financial sector
developments will affect potential growth in Belgium both directly and through indirect
effects on the production capacity of other sectors that depend on external finance and/or

foreign demand. To evaluate the path of potential output going forward, staff has used
historical data on the evolution of potential output following recessions of the early 1990s in
Belgium and in Scandinavian countries that experienced banking crises (see Analytical
Note 1). The results indicate that in 2009-11 potential growth would be about 1 percent lower
than its trend rate, which is itself declining due to demographic factors. Potential growth is
projected to recover gradually to its trend rate of about 1½ percent by 2015.
III. THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM: POST-CRISIS ASSESSMENT AND EXIT STRATEGIES
A. Financial Sector Conditions have Stabilized but Challenges Remain
17.
Since the worst of the financial crisis in the latter part of 2008, the financial
situation of the Belgian banking sector has stabilized but risks remain elevated.
Decisive government support and a gradual improvement in investor confidence have
resulted in a decline in CDS spreads and stabilization in equity prices.6 As a result, liquidity
conditions and access to financing have improved, while interbank rates have steadily come
down from their peak in October 2008. The government interventions and improved market
conditions have enabled the banks to raise their capital ratios and to de-leverage. In addition,
Belgian banks benefit from relatively low risks in the domestic residential real estate market
and lower household debt and non-financial companies’ leverage than the Euro area average.
However, risks to the loan portfolio are expected to rise and possible additional losses and
write-downs over the next few quarters remain a concern. While Belgian banks have very
few activities in Greece, all three major banks are still highly exposed to mature markets and
impaired structured asset classes, and one bank is quite vulnerable to developments in
Central and Eastern European (CEE) markets.
18.
Public support has boosted capital ratios but banks may face additional capital
charges. The government interventions have kept the regulatory capital ratios of the main
Belgian banks in line with the European average (Tier 1 ratios rose to above 10 percent in
2009) but banks remain highly leveraged. However, as market participants increasingly focus
on a more stringent capital definition, Belgian banks will need to boost their capital to
maintain market confidence and support the financing of the economy.

19.
The uncertain profitability outlook constrains the banks’ capacity to rebuild a
high-quality capital base through internal capital generation. The profitability of Belgian
banks improved gradually over 2009 because of rising net interest income. The improvement
in interest margins mainly reflected significantly lower funding costs in the current monetary
policy environment which, however, may not last. At the same time, the banks continued to
face impairments on their investment portfolio, notably through their remaining exposure to
structured assets, and lower revenues from asset management activities reflecting the sizable
wealth losses in the economy. This suggests that the banks may have to continue to rely on
external sources of capital, either public or private, for an extended period and that the repair
of balance sheets remains important and needs to be accompanied by asset disposal.
B. Macro-Financial Linkages and Cross-Border Spillovers
20.
A negative feedback loop between the financial sector and the real economy has
led to an increase in counterparty risk and deteriorating asset quality.7 Although the
risks of impairments on the banks’ domestic consumer and mortgage loan portfolio appear
relatively modest due to low household indebtedness and conservative lending practices, the
share of non-performing loans in the total loan portfolio has risen significantly and
impairment costs have more than doubled compared to their pre-crisis levels (see Analytical
Note 2). In particular, credit risks on corporate loans and international loans are on the rise.
Further losses could be expected given the usual lag between an economic downturn and

The financial sector’s contribution to the Belgian economy is substantial with total assets representing about
400 percent of GDP and providing 14 percent of employment in 2008.

13
21.
Bank lending to the private sector has shrunk since the beginning of the crisis.
The recession and declining producer confidence have dampened credit demand. At the same
time, lending conditions to the private sector for all types of loans, including mortgages, have
been tightened over the course of 2009, reportedly reflecting lingering difficulties in tapping
funding markets and ongoing deleveraging pressures. Growth of credits granted to resident
non-financial corporations of all sizes slowed down to 3.5 percent year-on-year in August
2009 from a maximum of about 15 percent in the course of 2008. However, while the
balance between credit demand and supply factors remains unclear, lending conditions in
Belgium appear marginally less restrictive than in other European countries according to
recent European Central Bank’s surveys (see Analytical Note 2).
22.
Credit to the economy should be closely monitored as risks of a creditless
recovery are a cause for concern even though mitigating factors are at play. Staff
estimates, based on the results of a cross-country analysis, that Belgium has a relatively high
probability of experiencing a creditless recovery.8, 9 An additional shock to the financial
sector could reduce credit and particularly affect sectors that are dependent on external
financing, potentially leading to a suboptimal allocation of resources. This points to the need
to ensure that exit strategies from support programs are carefully designed, in order to avoid
a credit squeeze. At the same time, the public support to the banks and their restructuring
with the banks’ increased focus on lending activities in the core home markets would limit
the risk of a creditless recovery.
23.
Belgian banks remain vulnerable to potential spillovers from both mature
markets and CEE. All main Belgian banks have major cross-border operations and Belgium
has a relatively high exposure to debtor countries. In particular, Belgian banks are highly
exposed to France, the US, the UK and the Netherlands. The breakdown of the Belgian loan
portfolio by countries shows that exposure is relatively high in some countries where
nonperforming loans have increased particularly rapidly such as Ireland and Spain. In
addition, one bank is quite vulnerable to developments in CEE.

8

In general a country is at risk of a creditless recovery (i.e., with negative real credit growth) if its economic
downturn was severe, if it experienced a credit boom before the crisis or if the recession came with a banking
crisis.

C. Preparing for Exit from Government Support
24.
Most of the government support schemes do not have built-in sunset clauses but
the restructuring plans of banks that benefitted from state aid are subject to the
European Commission’s approval and include the gradual withdrawal from the
emergency public support (see Analytical Note 2). The Belgian authorities agreed that
reducing the large public support in a timely manner is needed to reduce the distortions
created by public interventions and to lessen the moral hazard problems associated with
bailout operations, while exit needs to be well-organized to avoid market disruptions and
support credit.
Preparing for a timely and orderly exit
25.
Flexibility and clear communication are crucial for a successful exit strategy.
The authorities indicated that the pace of exit from the financial sector would be gradual in
order to test whether the financial system and financial markets can function on their own
again. Communicating exit plans in conjunction with the decision of the European
Commission on state aid will help anchor expectations and assuage lingering market fears.
26.
Public capital injections into financial institutions should be withdrawn only
when the capital adequacy of Belgian banks is satisfactory and the financial stability of

16
the banks is ensured. While the banks are implementing restructuring programs, it will most
likely take some time for their financial health to improve enough for the authorities to be
able to sell their shares or for the banks to reimburse the state directly. The authorities
considered that appropriate policies could provide incentives for the private recapitalization
of banks, including through restrictive compensation and dividend policies. In the meantime,
the government should actively safeguard the public’s investment in financial institutions
and maintain a level playing field across institutions.
27.
The unwinding of state refinancing guarantees is being done gradually and in a
targeted manner to avoid a backlash in market expectations. Staff supports the amended
one-year extension of refinancing guarantees offered to Dexia with a gradual reduction in the
level of coverage of the guarantees.10 The authorities indicated that that associated costs and
restriction on dividend and coupon payments should minimize moral hazard and induce the
bank to cease using the guarantees when they are no longer needed. Dexia already waived,
from October 16, 2009, the benefit of the guarantee for all new contracts with a maturity
below one month, and all new contracts with no fixed maturity, and is committed to end all
new guaranteed funding by mid-2010.
Strengthening the regulatory framework
28.
Staff welcomes the initiated reorganization of the Belgian supervisory authority.
While there is no first-best model of financial supervision, the current crisis has highlighted
the important role of adequate macro-prudential supervision in order to prevent banks from
undertaking excessively risky activities with large externalities. The creation by early 2011
of a new unified structure for the supervision of financial institutions, as in Germany and the
Netherlands, entails the merger as soon as feasible of the authorities vested in the central
bank and in the Banking, Finance and Insurance Commission (CBFA). The CBFA will
henceforth focus on surveillance of financial markets and the protection of consumer
interests. This reform should effectively combine the supervision of individual institutions
and of the system as a whole. The authorities agreed with staff that the transition period
should be carefully handled and have set up a transition committee to ensure that control
activities are not interrupted. They have also prepared a draft crisis law that would establish a
rule-based resolution framework for failed financial institutions while preserving their
systemic functions. It allows the authorities to transfer property and business lines from a
troubled financial institution to another private bank or public entity when the institution
enters resolution proceedings.

10

Given the improvement in the liquidity situation of Dexia, the cap on guaranteed outstanding was lowered
from €150 billion to €100 billion and the maturity of new long-term debts issued under the revised guarantee
framework was extended to a maximum of four years.

17
29.
Given the cross-border orientation of Belgian banks, the authorities should
continue to strongly support enhanced international cooperation in regulatory reform
and coordination of exit policies. Belgium should play an important role in implementing
the new European financial stability arrangements based on the recommendation of the
de Larosière group.11 In addition, there is a need to enhance information flows among
national supervisors and create a body that could settle potential conflicts arising from homehost supervision issues and the complex nature of cross-border banking. International
coordination of financial sector exit strategies is needed to avoid destabilizing financial
flows, particularly as regards liquidity support, the maximum coverage of deposit insurance
and bank/asset guarantees across the European Union.
IV. RESTORING FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY IS A PRIORITY
30.
The economic and financial crisis and the necessary public interventions have
led to a significant deterioration in the public finances. The cost of letting the automatic
stabilizers operate freely, the fiscal stimulus plan, and shoring up the financial sector have
significantly worsened the overall fiscal situation. The overall deficit jumped to about
6 percent of GDP in 2009 from 1.2 percent in 2008, and the public debt rose to close to
100 percent of GDP in 2009. The crisis has undone the gradual debt reduction achieved
during the last decade and has further hampered the planned pre-funding of the impending
rise in aging-related public expenditures. High debt raises the risk of sizeable increases in
interest expenditures, especially once interest rates increase from their currently subdued
levels or as markets begin to reassess sovereign risks in the Euro area.
31.
Recognizing the risk of unsustainable public debt dynamics, the government has
announced an appropriate fiscal consolidation strategy that aims to achieve a balanced
budget by 2015, in order to start reducing debt after 2011. The associated deficit objectives
and burden sharing path that was adopted by the government in the fall of 2009 had to be
further strengthened to reflect the recent ECOFIN Council recommendation to bring
Belgium’s overall deficit below the 3 percent Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) threshold
already in 2012. On this basis, the authorities have prepared a new Stability Program for the
period 2009-12.
A. Fiscal Outlook and Economic Stimulus
32.
The 2010 budget strikes the right balance between initiating the much-needed
fiscal consolidation and supporting the recovery. The budget is based on the
11

See http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/finances/docs/de_larosiere_report_en.pdf. The new European
supervisory institutions comprise : (i) the European Stability Risk Board, linked to the ECB, to bridge microand macro-prudential oversight; and (ii) the European System of Financial Supervisors to oversee the work of
national supervisors.

18
intergovernmental burden-sharing agreement for 2009-10 and the first multi-year fiscal
framework covering 2010-11, both welcome first steps in the consolidation strategy. The
2010 budgets at every level of government aim at streamlining spending and boosting
revenue in order to reduce the overall deficit to 5.1 percent of GDP (the new Stability
Program for 2009-12 aims at a deficit of 4.8 percent of GDP in 2010). The total fiscal effort
of about ¾ percent of GDP reflects the burden-sharing agreement allocating 65 percent of the
adjustment effort to the federal government and social security, and 35 percent to the regions,
linguistic communities, and local governments.
33.
In view of the signs of an incipient economic recovery and the strong need for
medium-term fiscal consolidation, most of the fiscal stimulus measures should be
reversed after 2010. In line with other European Union countries, the Belgian authorities
reacted to the crisis by adopting a stimulus package for 2009-10.12 The size of the stimulus
package is broadly appropriate given the large negative output gap and the limited fiscal
space in Belgium, but its composition raises concerns as some measures are neither
temporary nor targeted.13 While the reduction in the (very high) tax wedge on labor is a
welcome measure, it is important to reverse all other measures that entail a permanent
increase in expenditure or revenue losses.
B. Challenges of a Credible Medium-Term Fiscal Adjustment
34.
The government’s medium-term consolidation strategy should be enhanced by a
more formal institutional framework. Recent experience indicates that structural deficit
reductions are challenging to implement in Belgium. Key factors in this regard are the lack of
adequate incentives to keep real spending increases in line with trend economic growth and
the off-loading on the federal government of revenue shortfalls, higher social security
outlays, and some spending decided at regional and local government levels. The current
approach identifies the necessary structural fiscal efforts of at least 0.75 percent of GDP that
are required every year to achieve the balanced budget target by 2015. However, especially
for the period beyond 2012, it does not articulate the measures or mechanism to help ensure
the credibility of this commitment.
35.
Moreover, pressing aging-related costs cannot be ignored any longer. For the
period until 2014 it is estimated that the fiscal costs of aging will increase by more than
12

The fiscal stimulus package of about ½ percent of GDP in 2009-10 came in addition to income support
measures of ½ percent of GDP already in the 2009 budget. These discretionary measures have to be added to the
impact of the automatic stabilizers which is estimated at around 2½ percent of GDP in 2009 and ¾ percent of
GDP in 2010.

13

The Belgian stimulus included measures providing liquidity support to corporations, higher unemployment
benefits, a lower VAT rate for restaurants, “green economy” measures, accelerating public investment, and
support to the construction sector.

19
3 percent of GDP. The need for front-loaded fiscal tightening for intergenerational equity
purposes is largely accepted by the public and the authorities alike but the necessary
adjustment has been continuously postponed. The 2009 Sustainability Report of the
European Commission concludes that aging-induced structural adjustment in Belgium should
be at least 0.6 percent of GDP per year as opposed to the loosening fiscal stance over the
recent years.

The new Belgian Stability Program for 2009-12 represents a significant effort in
the right direction. The Program is based on the intergovernmental burden-sharing
agreement for 2009-10 and the planned agreement for 2011-12. It builds on the deficit
reduction targeted for 2010, and aims to reduce the overall deficit to 3 percent of GDP by
2012. The consolidation strategy contains a balanced package of revenue measures, steps to
discourage the use of early retirement schemes in the private sector, and measures to
strengthen fiscal responsibility at the regional and local levels. Any better-than-expected
fiscal performance at every level of government is to be directed towards debt reduction over
the coming years. However, part of the sharp consolidation results from rather optimistic
macroeconomic and revenue assumptions for 2011-12. Under more realistic assumptions,
additional fiscal efforts starting in 2011 will be needed to achieve the deficit targets.

37.
In view of the need to credibly commit to medium-term fiscal consolidation amid
considerable political uncertainty, the adoption of a rule-based framework would help
cement and reinforce the planned consolidation efforts. Under current fiscal federalism
arrangements the federal government is responsible for servicing most of the general
government debt while controlling only a fraction of general government revenue and
spending. In order to address the large existing imbalances it will be important to build on
the existing burden sharing agreements by framing them into a more credible multi-year
fiscal framework rather than having to resort to periodic renegotiations. Since a very sizeable
adjustment is needed to bring the public debt back to sustainable levels, the need to reach a
new consensus on deficit objectives anytime the fiscal situation deteriorates is very costly
and severely limits the potential scope of consolidation. Often, the consolidation objectives
are delayed, as was the case with the intergovernmental agreement for 2009-10 that was
signed on December 15, 2009, and based on already voted budgetary objectives of each level
of government. The agreement, while an important and welcome step, is still insufficient to
ensure deficit reduction efforts beyond 2010.
38.
Staff recommends introducing a cap on total expenditure growth for each level
of government and the social security administration while also considering additional
revenue measures. Overall spending limits could be set on a multi-annual basis and
translated into expenditure growth caps for each level of government. The implementation
could come either under a reinforced multi-year budgetary framework or evolve into a fiscal
rule, and should in both cases be based on realistic macroeconomic assumptions. Analytical
Note 3 compares the Swiss debt-brake rule to the recently adopted German fiscal rule and
discusses the applicability of this type of rule to Belgium. In view of the considerable growth
in healthcare spending and pensions expected in the coming years, it is important to take
measures to increase the effective retirement age and to reduce healthcare costs.14 At the
same time, regional governments should tighten their fiscal control over local governments
by strictly enforcing the existing golden rule and by ensuring the feasibility of the local
investment programs. Revenue measures should focus on broadening the tax base and
improving revenue collection. Significant gains can also be achieved by streamlining the
existing large number of tax expenditures.
39.
The government has expressed its support for continuing to implement part of
the fiscal consolidation by taking advantage of the age structure of the civil service, but
no specific decisions have been taken thus far. Over the next 10 years, about a third of the
public servants are scheduled to retire. The table below analyzes potential savings from
indicative scenarios of non-replacing every second or every fourth retiring public sector
employee. Depending on the scope of adjustment considered appropriate, each scenario will

have to be matched to the desired level of efficiency of the public services. At the same time,
the efficiency of public services in Belgium can be significantly improved, especially at subnational levels of government.15

V. STRUCTURAL REFORMS: RESTORING POTENTIAL GROWTH
40.
Pushing ahead with structural reforms in the labor and product markets is
important to restore growth in the aftermath of the recession. The adverse effect of the
crisis on potential output compounds the negative impact of demographic factors. In this
context, further labor and product market reforms are especially urgent, as they can help
prevent a rise in structural unemployment and limit productivity losses. Now that the worst
of the recession seems to have passed, the time is ripe for ambitious action on the structural
front that would support the budding recovery, strengthen competitiveness, and durably
improve living standards.

Further labor market reforms are essential for increasing the labor supply and
potential output, as well as for supporting job creation during the recovery. The low
employment rate in Belgium reflects in large part a high share of the long-term unemployed
and a low rate of labor force participation, notably for both younger and older workers.
Lifting the Belgian employment rate (currently at 61.5 percent of the working-age
population) to the Euro area average (65 percent) by reducing long-term unemployment and
raising labor force participation could increase potential output growth by about ½ percent
per year, on average, over the next five years. In this regard, and in broad agreement with the
authorities, staff recommends to focus on the following reform priorities:


Support re-absorption of the unemployed. With a further rise in cyclical
unemployment expected in 2010, the extension of the temporary unemployment
programs until the middle of the year is welcome. However, to avoid lasting damage
to employment incentives, such programs need to be phased out once the recovery
takes hold. At the same time, active labor market policies need to be stepped up,
while efforts to reduce the long-standing rigidities stemming from distortionary labor
taxes need to be continued. Further action is needed to enhance monitoring of job
search activities, apply penalties for refusal of suitable jobs, and increase job
counseling and training opportunities. In addition, limiting the level of unemployment
benefits over time or their duration would be effective in strengthening incentives for
job search.

23


Improve labor market participation. To counter demographic pressures on potential
output and promote the creation of new jobs in the economy, labor market
participation needs to be increased for both older and younger workers. This would
involve raising the effective retirement age by further limiting pathways into early
retirement, as well as extending activation programs to older workers. In this regard,
the system spelled out in the Stability Program 2009-12 that links the pre-pension age
with the benefits payable by employers is a step in the right direction. For younger
workers, this calls for reconsidering employment protection legislation, including for
workers on temporary contracts. For both groups, expanding job counseling and
training opportunities would help ease their way into the labor force.

42.
Further product market reforms are key to facilitate the necessary post-crisis
restructuring and to raise productivity and potential output over the medium term.
Staff recommends further strengthening the independence of the Competition Authority and
ensuring that it is provided with adequate resources. The Competition Authority should be
able to conduct independent sectoral analyses and issue specific recommendations regarding
policy changes that could improve competition. At the same time, the role of sectoral
regulators needs to be clearly defined and effective cooperation among the regulators needs
to be established. In the service sector, the EU Services Directive provides an opportunity for
further liberalization that should be fully seized.

ANALYTICAL NOTE 1: THE EFFECT OF THE CRISIS ON POTENTIAL OUTPUT IN BELGIUM1
1.
Measuring potential output is difficult even when the economic environment is
fairly stable, and it is especially challenging in times of crises. Potential output is usually
understood as the productive capacity of an economy, or the highest level of output that can
be attained without inflationary pressures. As such, it is of importance for both monetary and
fiscal policy makers, with implications for the sustainability of public finances, especially in
a country like Belgium. Alas, potential output is not directly observable and its estimates are
never precise, with uncertainty rising tremendously in times of crises.
2.
The current crisis is likely to have a large negative effect on potential output
through several channels, although some positive effects are also possible. Potential
output can be viewed as a product of potential, or “normal,” labor input (often defined in
terms of hours) and “normal” labor productivity. The effects on labor arise as a result of: (i)
growth in structural unemployment caused by crisis-related dislocations and the damage to
human capital from prolonged unemployment; (ii) declines in labor force participation,
because unemployment tends to discourage some workers from seeking jobs; and (iii)
increases in labor force participation, in particular of second-income earners, in response to
income and wealth losses. Turning to the effects on labor productivity, these may arise due
to: (i) reductions in capital-labor ratios reflecting slower capital accumulation as a result of
investment declines and obsolescence of parts of the pre-crisis capital stock; (ii) a
deterioration in total factor productivity associated with crisis-related dislocations and
impaired funding systems—including for efficiency-enhancing innovation—that can slow
resource reallocation; and (iii) an improvement in total factor productivity driven by
expulsion of inefficient activities and increased incentives for restructuring prompted by the
crisis.
3.
The effects of the crisis on potential output can be exacerbated or mitigated by
domestic policy measures and by external developments. In particular, failures to reverse
short-term crisis-related measures, such as unemployment support programs, as well as a
crisis-related rise in the recourse to early retirement could further depress potential output.
Conversely, certain fiscal stimulus measures—such as infrastructure investment—and
additional structural reform efforts spurred by the crisis are likely to have lasting positive
effects on potential output. At the same time, an accelerated build-up of public debt could be
a serious drag on potential output, because of the possible upward pressure on interest rates
and the higher tax burdens going forward. Finally, external developments—changes in
potential output in trading and financial partners—could have important effects on domestic
potential output, especially in very open economies, such as Belgium.

4.
The common methods of estimating and forecasting potential output are not well
suited to the inherently unstable crisis environment. Potential output is typically
estimated by isolating trend components in total GDP or its supply-side determinants—
usually within a Cobb-Douglas production function framework—and projecting these into
the future.2 Beside the well-known issues associated with filtering, such as end-point
problems and substantial revisions of recent estimates, these trend-based projections cannot
adequately reflect sudden shifts in potential output that may occur in a crisis. These estimates
can, however, provide helpful information about potential output dynamics in past crises, for
which the end-point and revision problems are much smaller. Specifically, historical
potential output estimates (based on the production function approach) can be used as a
benchmark for evaluating a current crisis-driven deviation of potential output from its precrisis path—the approach adopted below.
5.
The dynamics of potential output during the recessions and banking crises of the
early 1990s can provide a useful benchmark for potential output in Belgium. During the
early 1990s, many advanced European economies, including Belgium, simultaneously
experienced recessions, making that episode somewhat similar to the ongoing global
downturn. Although Belgium did not have a banking crisis at that time, the early 1990s saw
major banking crises in two other European economies—Finland and Sweden—that offer a
convenient proxy for Belgium. Of course, the crises are different: the current crisis in
Belgium was triggered by external financial spillovers, while the crises in Finland and
Sweden followed financial liberalization carried out without adequate policy adjustments.3
Yet, the current recession in Belgium is similar in severity to the early 1990s’ recessions in
Finland and Sweden, on average, and markedly more severe than the concurrent Belgian
recession that was not associated with a banking crisis (Figure 1-1).

6.
The effects of financial crises on potential output may be similar across Belgium,
Finland, and Sweden, while the effect of trade developments is larger in Belgium. The
current crisis is likely to affect potential output through its long-lasting effects on the
financial and the export sectors, as well as other sectors that are dependent on bank financing
and/or external demand. Table 1-1 compares the importance of these sectors in Belgium with
that in Finland and Sweden. It shows that although the weight of the financial sector in GDP
is somewhat higher in Belgium, it is not out of line, especially when compared to Sweden.
This observation supports the idea that financial sector disruptions may have broadly similar
effects in these economies. That said, the share of exports in GDP in Belgium is about twice
that of Finland and Sweden, hence external developments are likely to have larger effects on
Belgium. Although the growth dynamics of the financial sector in Belgium are now similar
to that in Finland and, especially, Sweden in the early 1990s, the recent slowdown in exports
is much bigger (Figures 1-2 and 1-3).

Banking crises in Finland and Sweden were associated with large slowdowns in
potential output, unlike the concurrent Belgian recession. According to the production
function estimates of the European Commission, potential growth began to decline in 1990 in
all three economies, a year before the banking crises hit Finland and Sweden in 1991
(Figure 1-4). In these two latter countries potential growth fell about 1.5 percentage points
below its pre-crisis rate in 1992-93, before recovering over the next three years. The fairly
rapid recovery was likely associated with the relatively timely resolution of the banking
crisis and successful restructuring of the manufacturing sectors. In Belgium, potential growth
slowed less dramatically in the early 1990s, but remained below its pre-recession rate over
the medium term. Table 1-2 shows average deviations of potential growth from the pre-crisis
(1989) rates in Belgium, Finland, and Sweden over the period following the crises of 1991.
The “baseline scenario” assigns the weights of ½ to Belgium and ¼ each to Finland and

36
Sweden, while the “alternative scenario” assigns equal weights to all three countries in the
calculation of average potential growth. The “baseline scenario” generates the pattern of a
more gradual slowdown and recovery in potential growth, while the “alternative scenario”
produces the pattern of a deeper decline followed by a stronger rebound.4

The historical benchmarks combined with the effects of demographic changes
indicate that a significant slowdown in potential growth in now likely in Belgium.
Potential growth has begun to weaken prior to the current recession because of moderating
migrant inflows, with ageing-related declines of the labor force expected to deepen the
slowdown in the coming years. This slowdown can be approximated by a no-crisis path
based on a linear interpolation of potential growth rates between the pre-crisis (2007) and
post-crisis (2014) points, using the production function estimates of the European
4

Given some uncertainty about the timing of the impact, the deviations of potential growth from its pre-crisis
rates are computed using three-year moving averages.

37
Commission (Figure 1-5, the dashed line). Accordingly, demographic pressures—notably
ageing—are expected to be responsible for a decline in potential growth in Belgium of about
0.4 percentage points between 2007 and 2014. Applying benchmark discounts based on the
experiences of Belgium, Finland, and Sweden in the early 1990s to this no-crisis path yields
potential growth rates shown in Figure 1-5 and Table 1-3. Overall, potential growth is
expected to slow considerably from about 1.9 percent in 2007 to between 0.7 and 0.8 percent
in 2010, depending on the scenario, before gradually returning to its no-crisis trend rate of
1.5 percent. These losses in potential output are broadly in line with the losses observed in
OECD countries following financial crises in the post-World War II period.5 That said, given
Belgium’s sensitivity to external developments, the recovery of potential growth will depend
a lot on the strength of the global economy going forward.

ANALYTICAL NOTE 2: IMPACT OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS ON BELGIAN BANKS, CREDIT AND
RISKS1
This note aims at taking stock of the financial soundness of the Belgian banking sector a year
after the crisis. After sizeable losses in the second half of 2008 and the first half of 2009,
Belgian banks are slowly recuperating.2 Massive public intervention has strengthened
capitalization and improved access to liquidity. However, profitability remains weak due to
higher cost of risks linked to deteriorating asset quality. Hence, higher capital ratios and
better quality of capital are likely to be required. While a severe banking crisis may impair
the sector’s capacity to perform its role of financial intermediation, public support and the
trend in the industry towards re-focusing on the home market could help ensure credit to the
economy will not be excessively tight when the demand picks up. Section A reviews key
financial soundness indicators of the Belgian banking sector and Section B discusses risks of
a creditless recovery.
A. Taking Stock: Belgian Banks One Year After
Market capitalization and balance sheet developments
1.
Among European countries, Belgium was particularly severely hit by the
financial crisis in 2008:Q4 and 2009:Q1 leading to substantial losses in market
capitalization and to sizeable balance sheet contraction. The financial crisis of 2008
affected simultaneously all three largest Belgian banking groups (Fortis, Dexia, and KBC).
As liquidity conditions tightened in 2008:Q4, the main Belgian banks saw their share prices
plummet when market participants expressed serious concerns over the banks’ exposure to
risky assets, business models and general solvency. In spite of massive public support,
Belgian banks lost more market capitalization than peer European banks (Figure 2-1). A year
after the crisis, the sector’s overall balance sheet has shrunk, reflecting in part the divestment
of Fortis NL during 2008:Q4 but also a general shortening of the banks’ balance sheets as
institutions have cut back on trading and investment banking activities and put some
portfolios in run-off (Figure 2-2).

This note was prepared by Boriana Yontcheva.

The Belgian banking sector is highly concentrated with four bancassurance groups—Fortis BNP Paribas (now
subsidiary of BNP Paribas), Dexia, KBC, and ING-Belgium (subsidiary of Dutch bank ING)—holding more
than 80 percent of banking sector assets, deposits, and loans. Further to public interventions, Fortis group was
dismantled, its Dutch subsidiary sold to the Netherlands government and Fortis bank Belgium to BNP Paribas.
This note will focus on Dexia and KBC as these are the largest remaining Belgian banks.

Profitability and asset quality
2.
Profitability is recovering but impairment costs remain higher than their precrisis levels. Over the last year, significant losses resulting from the banks’ investment
portfolio, notably through their exposure to structured assets, but also from lower revenues
from asset management and losses on the trading books severely affected profitability but
results are gradually improving. The majority of the losses occurred during the second half of
2008 (Figure 2-3). The fall in net income was mostly caused by exceptional losses and oneoff risk charges as can be seen for the almost tenfold increase in impairment-related costs
from €1.41 billion to €11.9 billion and the reduction in pre-provision income. Pre-provision
income gradually returned to positive territory in 2009 but impairment costs are still
dragging profit down.

Box 2-1. 2009:Q3 Earning Results of KBC and Dexia
Third quarter results released by major Belgian banks confirm the recovery trend. The
quarterly income results profile of KBC and Dexia show a progressive return to pre-crisis levels for
gross income for both banks. Banks have been able to improve pre-provision profits but credit
charges are a severe drag on profitability. Liquidity conditions have improved with banks issuing
significant amounts of both covered and unsecured bonds in the wholesale market.

Looking at net income, the results differ markedly between the two banks. After the divestment
from its US monoline FSA, Dexia’s impairment costs returned to a lower level allowing consolidated
net income for the first nine months of 2009 to exceed its level over the same period in 2008. In the
case of KBC, high loan loss provisions associated with deteriorating asset quality exceeded other
sources of revenue even in 2009 as value adjustments on the banks’ synthetic CDO portfolio occurred
in 2009:Q2. Hence, while gross income improved, net income remains much lower than in 2008.

Revenues and profit are driven by net interest income and benefit from current
monetary conditions but asset quality remains a challenge. Funding costs have
significantly fallen, helping the rate of return on assets recover somewhat in spite of
significant increases in nonperforming loans (NPLs; Figure 2-5). However, banks’
profitability is dependent on a yield curve that is unlikely to remain as steep as currently. In
addition, impairment costs have more than doubled from their pre-crisis level (Figure 2-6).
The cost of risk has shifted from provisioning for financial assets to provisioning for the loan
book, reflecting both a welcome disengagement from riskier asset classes but also a
deterioration of the economic environment. Some further losses could be expected given the
usual lag between economic downturns and credit defaults.

Thanks to traditionally sound loan portfolios, Belgian banks’ NPL ratios are
lower than the average for other banks in Europe but loan losses are nonetheless rising.
The share of non-performing loans in the total loan portfolio for Belgian banks has increased
but remains lower than in other European banks, especially compared to those with strong
presence in CEE markets. In particular, Dexia’s relatively low NPL level reflects the
specificity of its portfolio of municipal bonds. However, costs of risks have nonetheless
doubled as provisions for loan losses have significantly increased from pre-crisis levels,
adversely affecting net income and the capacity to internally generate capital (Figure 2-7).

Capitalization
5.
Government intervention has increased capital and allowed regulatory ratios to
remain in line with European averages, but the availability and quality of capital will
be the main challenge ahead. Unprecedented public capital injections helped Belgian banks
to maintain tier 1 and core tier 1 ratios in line with peer European banks (Figure 2-8).
However, market participants increasingly focus on the more stringent capital definitions,
with “equity-like” features. Looking ahead, regulatory reforms will likely require banks to
raise the share of capital with stronger loss absorption features and reduce the share of hybrid
capital. In addition, risks remain in the trading and loan books of Belgian banks. Optimal
capitalization levels should not only provide sufficient buffers to absorb future losses from a
further deterioration in asset quality but also support confidence in the banks. In this respect,
Belgian banks may still need to boost their equity tier 1 level capital (Table 2-1). Given the
expected slow economic recovery, the banks capacities to generate and retain earnings will
need to be accompanied by adequate deleveraging strategies.

Restructuring plans
6.
The financial crisis has triggered structural changes in the Belgian banking system
and has led to a shift in the business model for all three main banks. Fortis has been sold to a
foreign bank and is being transformed from a previously integrated group to distinct national
banking and insurance entities. KBC and Dexia as beneficiaries from state aid also had to
develop restructuring plans that need approval by the European Commission. The announced
strategies generally emphasize back-to-basics business, de-risking, and strengthening core
and domestic retail franchises (see Box 2-2).
B. Looking Ahead: How Acute are Risks of a Creditless Recovery?
7.
The ability of the financial sector to supply credit for investment and
consumption will be a crucial factor in the economic recovery process. Disruptions in the
credit supply may force firms and households to delay investment and consumption
expenditures. Reduced credit supply can lead to lower growth rates for financially dependent
sectors and industries that rely on external financing, potentially resulting in a suboptimal
allocation of resources. In creditless recoveries, investment makes a disproportionately
smaller contribution to growth and output growth is on average one-third lower than in
“normal” recoveries.

8.
Creditless recoveries are associated with impaired financial intermediation. A
recent IMF study3 identifies creditless recoveries in a broad set of countries and assesses
which types of downturn are more prone to be followed by a creditless recovery.4 When a
country experiences a recession preceded by a banking crisis, the likelihood for its recovery
to be creditless more than doubles. Accordingly, Belgium has a relatively high probability to
have a creditless recovery after the crisis.
9.
Credit to the economy has slowed in Belgium compared to the pre-crisis levels
but conditions appear marginally more favorable than in other European countries.
Lending to businesses in Belgium continued to slow in 2009:Q3 but still increased by
1.4 percent year-on-year while credit in the euro-zone contracted by 0.1 percent year-on-year
in September 2009. As in other countries, the balance between credit demand and supply
factors remains unclear but information collected from bank lending officers and surveys of
SMEs indicate that Belgian small businesses obtain credit more easily and have better
confidence about future access to bank financing (Figure 2-9).5 Easier access to credit might
be reflecting the success of public loan-guarantee schemes that Belgian small businesses
benefit from. In addition, in the third quarter of 2009, the net percentage of banks reporting a
tightening of credit standards applied to loans and credit lines to enterprises declined,
bringing the net tightening close to a halt. Among other factors, improved banks’ access to
market financing and their strengthened liquidity position contributed to an easing of credit
standards for loans to enterprises.

A creditless recovery is defined to happen when the growth rate of real bank credit is zero or negative during
the 3-year period following a recession. A recession episode is identified whenever the cyclical component of
GDP exceeds one-standard deviation below zero. It is measured starting the year before the previous peak and
until the year of the trough.

10.
The public intervention and ongoing changes in the Belgian banking business
model could be mitigating factors that lessen the risks of a creditless recovery.
Unprecedented public intervention helped the banking sector and is likely to prop up
financial intermediation. Due to the prompt intervention that boosted capital levels and
guaranteed or disposed of toxic assets, banks should be able to resume lending faster
compared to some of their European peers that remain saddled with losses on toxic assets.
The post-crisis restructuring of Belgian banks will also lead them to focus on traditional
lending activities in their core home market. Part of the restructuring strategies designed for
both KBC and Dexia imply that their business model will rely much less on trading activities
than before the crisis and the acquisition of Fortis by BNP Paribas will also lead to
transferring most proprietary trading to some other BNP structure. Hence, Belgian banks are
likely to allocate resources to lending to Belgian non-financial corporations when the
demand for credit picks up.

ANALYTICAL NOTE 3. FISCAL RULES TO ENSURE SUSTAINABILITY: WOULD A DEBT-BRAKE
RULE WORK FOR BELGIUM?1
1.
In the context of Belgium’s current complicated political environment and
frequent elections,2 fiscal rules could help to limit distorted incentives in policymaking.
Political expediency considerations may lead the numerous layers of government to act with
an insufficient degree of commitment to longer-term challenges such as much-needed fiscal
consolidation and public debt reduction. Specifically, this could involve a relative neglect for
future tax hikes and expenditure cuts that current deficits inevitably entail. Moreover, special
interest groups and regional constituencies may constrain longer-term fiscal policy decisions
that invariably entail distributive consequences. Against this background, early commitment
to a credible medium-term fiscal framework and a set of appropriate fiscal rules could help to
restore fiscal sustainability and avert the related adverse effects on the economy.
2.
Previous successful fiscal consolidation efforts in Belgium were rooted in a
strong political commitment but increased political uncertainty has diminished the
prospects of fixing the looming public debt and ageing problems based on a durable
political consensus. Fiscal policy in Belgium is constrained by the supranational fiscal rules
under the EU Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). Historically, the numerical deficit targets set
in the annual Stability Programs represented upper limits on the overall deficit path and
periodic negotiations determined the fiscal effort to be undertaken by the Federal
Government, the communities, and the regions while local governments were subject to a
balanced budget rule. However, in most recent years there were frequent target
renegotiations (sometimes twice a year, during the annual budget preparation in
September/October and its revision in February/March). However, given the current political
uncertainty, the cost of such flexibility is high in terms of diluting the credibility of
commitment to medium-term targets and the need to grant political concessions to achieve
the necessary fiscal tightening.
3.
Effective options other than fiscal rules could also be considered but these
involve far-reaching institutional reforms. Several countries have strengthened their fiscal
frameworks without emphasizing numerical fiscal targets. Some of these countries have
managed to achieve significant fiscal consolidations and enjoy public and market confidence
in the sustainability of their public finances. Structural reforms that reinforced their
1

Expectations for Sustainable Public Finances” and simulations using the Fund’s Global Integrated Monetary and
Fiscal (GIMF) model calibrated for Belgium.

The near future elections schedule includes elections at the federal level in 2011, at the local level in 2012, at
the regional level in 2014, and then the cycle restarts. In addition, the same candidates often run for different
levels of government.

53
institutional fiscal policy frameworks were a key ingredient for this success. For instance,
Australia and New Zealand have maintained a good fiscal performance during recent decades
in connection with the adoption of institutional arrangements—generally referred to as fiscal
responsibility frameworks—during the 1990s to ensure prudent fiscal policies. Other
countries, such as Brazil, have placed fiscal responsibility laws at the center of their fiscal
framework, complemented by explicit numerical targets on some fiscal aggregates.
4.
The discussion is ongoing on the best time to introduce a fiscal rule, depending
on country-specific circumstances and the degree of economic uncertainty. A fiscal rule
can be adopted at the inception of an adjustment strategy or accompany consolidation efforts.
The first would aim at lending much-needed credibility at the outset of a policy change; the
latter would seek to lock in changes in policy preferences that have been signaled over time.
Which of the two strategies promises greater success would depend on country-specific
circumstances, such as credibility of existing policies (e.g., enhanced by accompanying fiscal
and structural reforms) or a departure from the earlier policy direction, and the degree of
economic uncertainty. In the case of Belgium, announcing a fiscal rule before the next
election at the federal level in mid-2011 which would be introduced in 2-3 years from now
would be an option that could help strengthen the credibility of fiscal consolidation. The
current high degree of uncertainty about the measurement of the main macroeconomic
aggregates will have to be taken into account in the design of such rule.
5.
Fiscal discipline is particularly challenging in federal states where sub-national
governments account for a large share of resources, as is the case for Belgian regional,
community, and local governments that receive over 10 percent of GDP in transferred
revenues from the federal government.3 This arises from adverse incentives to excessive
spending and insufficient revenue collection that trigger large fiscal imbalances at the federal
level with repercussions for the general government finances. The chief factors leading to
fiscal profligacy by sub-national governments include limited revenue authority and
dependence on central government transfers that create moral hazard, spillovers from higherspending jurisdictions, and asymmetries in economic cycles across regions that may spur
procyclical fiscal behaviors. As the need for fiscal adjustment in Belgium is rather large, it
would be important to have a fiscal rules framework in place which ensures that the burden
of fiscal consolidation is shared fairly across different government levels and according to
which the effort distribution between different layers of government is perceived as fair.
6.
A good example of a fiscal rules framework is the structural debt-brake rule
that has been successfully applied in Switzerland for some time. This rule aims at a
balanced budget over the cycle: for each year, an expenditure ceiling is set based on
3

Stability Programme,” January 2010.

54
expected, cyclically adjusted revenues. It is possible to run deficits in a recession but
surpluses are required in a boom period so that over the course of a full cycle deficits and
surpluses are expected to cancel out. Differences between budget targets and outcomes are
recorded in a notional account, and the authorities must eliminate any negative balance on
this account once it cumulatively exceeds a predetermined level. While there are some
concerns about the operation of such a rule with regards to the adequate room for
discretionary fiscal policy and about technical complexities that may make the rules less
transparent, these can be addressed through the use of appropriate escape clauses and the
operation of an independent fiscal agency.
7.
Another useful example is the structural fiscal rule that has been recently
adopted in Germany and that builds on the Swiss experience. The structural (and net of
one-off items) federal budget deficit is bound by the Constitution not to exceed 0.35 percent
of GDP from 2016 the states will be bound by a balanced budget rule starting in 2020. If the
structural balance deviates from the limit, the (positive or negative) gap is stored in a
notional control account corrected for those errors deriving from a different than expected
real GDP growth. If the control account debit exceeds 1.5 percent of GDP, the Constitution
requires an adjustment. However, the adjustment only needs to start during an economic
recovery to avoid a procyclical tightening. The fiscal rules allow for exceptions, if sanctioned
by a super-majority in parliament, in case of a natural disaster or exceptional emergencies
outside government control.
Fiscal Rules in the Face of Shocks: Insights from Model Simulations
8.
Model-based simulations were used to gain further insights into what could be
the best design of a fiscal rule in Belgium and to illustrate how different fiscal rules
interact with a variety of economic shocks. The simulations were performed with the IMF
Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal (GIMF) model4 calibrated to represent the main
features of the Belgian economy. These simulations confirm the significant macroeconomic
stabilizing effects of cyclically-adjusted balance rules under both demand and supply shocks.
This is in contrast to fiscal rules that target the nominal (cyclically unadjusted) budget
balance. The simulations also show that a structural balance rule complemented with an
adjustment to dampen public debt volatility performs significantly better than a nominal
budget balance rule and can materially reduce public debt accumulation while maintaining
substantial countercyclical effectiveness.

If the negative balance in the notional
compensation account exceeds 6 percent
of expenditures (about 0.6 percent of
GDP) the authorities are required by law
to take measures sufficient to reduce the
balance below this level.

If the negative control account balance
exceeds 1.5 percent of GDP the
Constitution requires an adjustment. In
practice, the adjustment is meant to start
already when a limit of 1.0 percent of
GDP is reached, as set out in ordinary
law.

Avoiding
procyclicality

The adjustment needs to take place
within three years if the notional account
reaches its ceiling.

The adjustment only needs to be
launched during an economic recovery.

Escape
clauses

Parliament can approve with a
supermajority a budget deviating from the
rule in “exceptional circumstances.” A rule
specifies how such deviations should be
corrected.

The budget rules allows for exceptions, if
adopted by supermajority in parliament, in
case of a natural disaster or exceptional
emergencies. Adoption of exceptionally
higher budget deficits, however, needs to
be accompanied by an amortization plan.
While there are no binding sanctions for
violating the new budget rule, a Stability
Council will be established with the task
to monitor the development of public
finances and issue early warnings.

56
9.
The performance of the model economy and the path of fiscal aggregates was
explored for the following fiscal rules:5
A. Nominal balance rule. The actual balance must meet the balanced-budget target every
year. Deviations from trend in revenue and expenditure, prompted endogenously by the
different shocks, must be offset by discretionary budget measures. In the simulations,
these offsetting measures are modeled as direct transfers (or levies, as the case may be) in
amounts necessary to meet the predetermined balanced-budget target.
B. Structural balance rule. The actual balance deviates from the target when actual output
deviates from its potential level, by an amount that corresponds to the free play of the
automatic stabilizers. Debt is allowed to rise (or decline) endogenously without
prompting specific action. Thus, after severe downward shocks, debt accumulation could
be substantial and, although temporary from a long-term standpoint, strongly persistent
over the medium-term.
C. Structural balance rule with medium-term debt adjustment. This is similar to the above
structural balance rule, but with an additional adjustment to bring debt to its target over
time—gradually, but at a faster pace than under a pure structural balance rule.
10.
The different fiscal rules were evaluated for a small open economy calibrated to
mimic main features of Belgium under a variety of negative shocks. In particular, the
shocks considered were downward domestic demand shocks to consumption and investment,
and an exogenous fall in output capacity (a fall in productivity).
11.
The simulations highlight the trade-off between macroeconomic volatility and
debt sustainability. For each shock, the volatility of macroeconomic variables that are likely
to be of concern to policymakers (output, employment, and consumption) is higher under a
balanced budget rule than under a structural balance rule—often by a large measure. This is
achieved through a countercyclical fiscal policy under the structural balance rule: in the
model, government transfers to liquidity constrained households do not need to be reduced in
the face of declining tax revenue. Thus, the income of economic agents, particularly those
that are liquidity constrained, is also more stable—supporting consumption and activity
through the downturn caused by the shocks. However, the more active countercyclical fiscal
policy comes at the price of significant debt accumulation over the trough of the downturn. It
5

The following formula (written in surplus form) maps the rules by selecting different values for the feedback
coefficients on the output gap and debt deviation from a long-term objective. A balanced budget rule sets all
cyclical adjustment coefficients to zero while the structural balance rule sets the output gap coefficient equal to
0.4, obtained by correcting the European Commission estimate of 0.5 by the numerous one-off measures; to
which a debt-adjustment coefficient of 0.4 is added to help bring debt ratio back to target faster.

57
is worth mentioning the model’s limitation in replicating output volatility under different
fiscal rules. The main transmission channel in the model operates through the wealth effect
of the liquidity-constrained agents who respond to any negative shock to their income by
supplying more labor (hours worked). This, in turn implies that the model will always
underestimate the fall in aggregate output in response to negative shocks.
12.
In the current circumstances of rapid escalation in public debt and associated
potential market concerns, adjustments to a structural balance rule that accelerate debt
reduction could be considered. Adding to a pure structural balance rule (rule B) a moderate
adjustment to temper the operation of the automatic stabilizers when the public debt is
particularly high (rule C), maintains to a large extent the desired stabilization properties
while significantly mitigating the accumulation of debt (Figure 3-1). When the economy
starts at or near the debt target and suffers an adverse shock the government can initially
conduct countercyclical fiscal policy in virtually the same manner under a structural balance
target (rule B) and under a modified structural balance target (rule C). As the public debt
rises above its target, however, the modified structural balance rule will call for an increasing
annual adjustment to moderate the debt build-up. This could be particularly useful in
situations of long downturns when concerns about fiscal solvency could emerge in the face
of persistent large deficits and mounting public debt. For example, under a demand shock
that prompts a decline of output to 1 percentage point below its potential level, the associated
debt increase at its peak under a structural balance rule (rule B) is about 4 percent of GDP
but much smaller (1½ percent of GDP) under a modified structural balance rule (rule C).

Exchange Rate Arrangements



Belgium’s currency is the euro, which floats freely and independently against other
currencies.



Belgium maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers
for current international transactions, except for restrictions maintained solely for
security reasons. These measures are established by European Union regulations and
have been notified to the Fund pursuant to Executive Board Decision No. 144(52/51).

FSAP Participation:

FSAP Assessment

IMF Country Report No. 06/75

Summary: The report concluded that Belgium’s financial system is resilient and benefits from a
number of Belgium-specific features that help stability. These include a traditionally cautious
attitude toward risk by banks, large holdings of government securities, extremely low holdings of
equity by banks, a stable source of funding benefiting from generous tax incentives, a high
standard of banking supervision, and a stable macroeconomic policy framework. Overall,
supervision showed a high degree of compliance with international standards. Near-term
vulnerability appears low, reflecting the soundness of the dominant banking system, the
generally benign financial environment, the strong financial condition of the corporate sector,
and the relatively healthy financial position of the household sector. Financial institutions were
found to withstand an adverse macroeconomic stress well, helped in part by the beneficial
diversification in the bancassurance model.

4

Notwithstanding the strengths of the Belgian financial sector, a number of issues emerged from
the FSAP. The heavy exposure abroad, the open nature of the economy, and the importance of
the Euroclear Group globally, made the domestic financial system potentially vulnerable to
global economic developments and financial contagion. Risks remained and may increase with a
downturn in the business cycle, increased cross-border operations, and deeper links with the
global money centers. In line with the 2005 FSAP recommendations, the supervisory framework
has been strengthened. The Banking, Finance, and Insurance Commission’s (CBFA)
management committee has been streamlined and synergies between the CBFA and the National
Bank of Belgium (NBB) have been further developed. Regular stress tests have helped promote a
systematic dialogue between supervisory authorities and market participants, while detailed
procedures for financial crisis management have been tested. Prudential supervision of the
insurance sector has been upgraded and regulation of the pension funds sector reinforced.

ANNEX II. BELGIUM: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Belgium’s economic and financial statistics are adequate for surveillance purposes. The
National Bank of Belgium (NBB) regularly publishes a full range of economic and financial
data and provides calendar dates of main statistical releases. On-line access to these
comprehensive databases is facilitated by the NBB’s data search engine, Belgostat. Belgium
is a SDDS subscriber. Statistics for International Financial Statistics on banking institutions
and monetary aggregates are prepared on a monthly basis and are timely.
Belgium adopted the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts 1995 (ESA95)
in 1999. Revisions of national accounts started in November 2005 to comply with
EUROSTAT requirements and prepare for the adoption of chain-linked national accounts
statistics. Unlike in other countries, the NBB is responsible for compiling national accounts
statistics. Quarterly accounts are published within a lag of three months. Both annual and
quarterly accounts data are of good quality, with shortcomings mainly related to export and
import deflators, which are based on unit values, rather than prices collected directly from
exporters and importers.
General government revenue, expenditure, and balance on an accrual basis (ESA95) are
published annually. The NBB publishes monthly data on central government operations and
quarterly data on general government operations since April 2007.
The overall quality and availability of financial indicators are good. The authorities are
providing quarterly updates of financial sector indicators (FSIs) in a timely manner.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation
with Belgium
On March 8, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Belgium.1
Background
The Belgian economy was hit hard by the global financial crisis and economic downturn. In
response, the authorities took measures to support the financial sector and let the automatic
fiscal stabilizers operate freely while implementing a moderate stimulus plan. These actions
helped to stabilize the financial sector and halt the economic downturn. At the same time,
ground has been lost in addressing the high public debt and the spending pressures related to
population aging, and in strengthening competitiveness and pursuing labor and product market
reforms. The political situation remains complex, complicating the authorities’ efforts to tackle
the medium-term challenges facing the country in the areas of public finances and structural
reforms.
The near-term outlook is challenging, with real GDP expected to drop by about 3 percent in
2009 and a gradual recovery projected for 2010. The unemployment rate will continue to rise in
2010 and inflation pressures are expected to remain subdued. Uncertainty to the outlook is high
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

but risks appear broadly balanced. The crisis will have a considerable downward impact on
potential growth, in addition to that of demographic factors, in 2009-11.
The banking sector has stabilized after massive public intervention, but its financial situation
remains fragile and vulnerable to potential spillovers from mature markets and emerging
Europe. The uncertain profitability outlook constrains the banks’ capacity to rebuild a highquality capital base through internal capital generation. The withdrawal from the emergency
support to the financial sector will be done gradually to avoid market disruptions and a credit
squeeze. The authorities have initiated the creation by early 2011 of a unified structure to
supervise financial institutions at the National Bank of Belgium, in order to more effectively
combine the supervision of individual institutions and of the system as a whole. A draft crisis law
that would establish a rule-based resolution framework for failed financial institutions has also
been prepared.
Recognizing the risk of unsustainable public debt dynamics, the government has announced a
fiscal consolidation strategy that appropriately aims to achieve a balanced budget by 2015. The
economic and financial crisis and the necessary public interventions have led to a significant
deterioration in the public finances with the overall deficit jumping to 5.8 percent of GDP and the
public debt rising to close to 100 percent of GDP in 2009. The 2010 budget aims at streamlining
spending and boosting revenue to reduce the overall deficit to 5.1 percent of GDP. The total
fiscal effort of about ¾ percent of GDP reflects the intergovernmental burden-sharing
agreement for 2009-10 and the first multi-year fiscal framework covering 2010-11. The new
Belgian Stability Program for 2009-12 builds on the deficit reduction targeted for 2010 and aims
to reduce the overall deficit to 3 percent of GDP by 2012. The planned fiscal consolidation
requires significant efforts at all government levels and in the social security system.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors, noting that Belgium had been severely hit by the global crisis, commended
the authorities for taking prompt measures to support the economy and stabilize the financial
system. Directors observed that, although the economic recession in Belgium was less severe
than the euro area average, the recovery is expected to be gradual and fragile, with unusually
high uncertainty. The near term outlook is clouded by a sluggish rebound in both domestic and
external demand, rising unemployment, and growing public debt. Early action is crucial to
restore fiscal sustainability, further reinforce financial stability, and intensify labor and product
market reforms to boost competitiveness and growth prospects.
Directors underscored the importance of strong and credible medium-term adjustment to put
Belgium’s public finances back on a sustainable path and address the challenges arising from
an aging population. They supported the authorities’ fiscal consolidation strategy to achieve a
balanced budget by 2015, stressing that such a strategy should be backed by concrete

3
measures and based on prudent macroeconomic assumptions. Directors agreed that the 2010
budget strikes the right balance between initiating the much-needed fiscal consolidation and
supporting the recovery. They welcomed the authorities’ commitment to take additional actions
if necessary to achieve the deficit targets for 2011 and beyond. In addition to reversing most of
the fiscal stimulus measures after 2010, it would be important to restrain expenditure, increase
the effective retirement age, and reduce the growth of health care costs. These require
significant efforts at all government levels and in the social security system. Adopting a rulebased fiscal framework would help enhance the credibility of the consolidation efforts.
Directors considered that, although the banking sector has stabilized after massive public
intervention, its financial situation remains fragile and is vulnerable to potential spillovers from
both mature markets and emerging market countries in Europe. This points to continued need
for bank recapitalization, balance sheet repair, and targeted liquidity support in the near future.
Directors recommended that the authorities withdraw exceptional support to the financial sector
gradually, in a manner that is fully aligned with the concerted EU exit policies, and monitor credit
to the economy closely to avoid adverse market reactions and a credit squeeze. They
welcomed the reorganization of the Belgian supervisory authority consolidating the supervision
of individual institutions and that of the system as a whole. The preparation of a draft crisis law
is a welcome step toward establishing a rule-based resolution framework for failed financial
institutions.
Directors highlighted the urgency of structural reforms aimed at raising productivity and
restoring growth to its potential. They encouraged the authorities to push ahead with the
restructuring of the labor and product markets. Reabsorbing the unemployed and increasing
labor market participation are a priority. In this context, Directors welcomed the proposed
system that would link the pre-pension age to the benefits payable by employers. To strengthen
competition, Directors recommended enhancing the independence of the Competition Authority,
defining clearly the role of sectoral regulators, and establishing effective cooperation among the
different regulators. The importance of wage moderation was also emphasized, with a number
of Directors suggesting that the authorities reconsider the merits of wage indexation.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
