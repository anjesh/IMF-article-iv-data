Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation and Request for a Three-Year
Arrangement Under the Extended Credit Facility and for Additional Interim
Assistance Under the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative
Prepared by the African Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Roger Nord and Thomas Dorsey
March 24, 2010

Discussions: Held in Bissau January 12-26, 2010. The team comprised Mr. Drummond
(head), Mr. Daal, Mr. Peña (all AFR), Mr. Jenkins (SPR), and Mr. Fonseca (local
economist). Mr. Nord joined the mission at the end. Mr. Sembene (OED) participated in
the policy discussions. The team met with President Malam Bacai Sanhá, Prime Minister
Carlos Gomes Jr., Minister of Finance José Mario Vaz, Minister of Economy Helena
Embaló, BCEAO National Director João Fadia, other ministers and senior government
officials, and representatives of trade unions, civil society, development partners, and the
private sector. The staff worked closely with teams from the European Commission, the
African Development Bank, and the World Bank.
Article IV consultation: The discussions had three themes: (i) strengthening public
finances and addressing the domestic arrears problem; (ii) addressing structural issues to
encourage private sector growth and combat poverty; and (iii) achieving external sector
sustainability. The medium-term ECF program will be an essential first step in addressing
these challenges.
ECF arrangement: The authorities are requesting a three-year ECF-supported
arrangement (2010–12) of 157.5 percent of quota (SDR 22.365 million), including
37.5 percent of quota for early 2008–09 EPCA repurchase. The authorities are also
requesting the second tranche of interim HIPC assistance of SDR 1.016 million.
Article VIII: Guinea-Bissau has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and

4. It shares a common currency (the CFA franc), pegged to the euro, with other members
of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). The regional central
bank, the BCEAO conducts monetary and exchange rate policies for the region. Banks are
supervised by the WAEMU Banking Commission.
Fund Relations: The previous Article IV consultation was concluded on August 28, 2007.

Executive Summary
Political conditions: After an extended period of political instability following the 1999
domestic conflict, the presidential election last year and a representative civilian government
are significant markers of much-needed political stability. This has allowed the government
to move away from day-to-day business and take a medium-term view of necessary reforms,
especially to alleviate poverty.
Economic developments: Despite the difficult external environment and its political
challenges, in 2009 Guinea-Bissau made progress in stabilizing its economy through the
EPCA-supported program. Real GDP growth reached 3 percent, driven by a favorable
cashew harvest and a pick-up in construction activity; inflation slowed, and the budget was
stabilized. Performance in the EPCA-supported program was broadly satisfactory. All but
two EPCA quantitative performance indicators were met, and progress on structural reforms
accelerated towards the end of last year.
The authorities’ medium-term economic program, for which they are requesting ECF
support, centers on reinforcing public finances, modernizing public administration, and
raising the quality of public services. It also seeks to promote job creation by removing
impediments to private sector development and to enhance the provision of financial
services. Satisfactory performance could pave the way for Guinea-Bissau to benefit by yearend from debt relief through the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative
and Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). The authorities expect broad-based donor
support in line with annual commitments of recent years, with residual financing gaps that
could be filled by an ECF arrangement.
The main risks relate to political instability, vulnerability to external shocks, and the
possibility of inadequate donor support. The country is highly dependent on the agricultural
sector. It has only a small domestic market and a narrow export base that is vulnerable to
shocks.

6

I.

INTRODUCTION: WHAT IS DIFFERENT NOW?

1.
For over a decade, the economic and political situation in Guinea-Bissau was
difficult (Figure 1), because of:


Years of political instability since the 1999 civil conflict, with frequent changes of
government and weak institutions.



Unsustainable fiscal deficits, because of a low tax base, a high ratio of expenditures to
domestic revenues, and overreliance on external budget support.



Unfavorable external conditions, with weak terms of trade in circumstances where the
economy is more vulnerable to external shocks than its peers because it is dependent
on a single export product and market.



Debt distress.

2.
Throughout, the Fund provided assistance in a variety of ways (Box 1).
Immediately after the civil conflict ended in 2000, a PRGF supported program was put in
place and Guinea-Bissau reached the decision point for the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) Initiative. However, divisive and erratic policies led to further political
tension and, combined with fragile institutions and little technical capacity, to increasing
fiscal problems. The program expired at end-2003 without a review being concluded. Since
then, the Fund has been helping to build capacity, with staff monitored programs, and
Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance (EPCA; 2008, 2009). In the latest EPCA Guinea-Bissau
has met most quantitative targets and most structural reform measures.
3.
A confluence of favorable developments is now helping create an opportunity for
Guinea-Bissau to directly confront the challenges of the last decade:


Political stability, resulting from the peaceful presidential election last year and a
representative civilian government.



Institutions and technical capacity that have improved in recent years, with the help of
extensive technical assistance from development partners.



Favorable performance in the 2009 EPCA-supported program that has created the
conditions for Guinea-Bissau to make a transition to a medium-term program of
growth and economic reforms.



Determined political will to overcome the difficult fiscal and debt distress situation,
so that the country can reach the HIPC and MDRI completion point.

7

Box 1. Fund Involvement in Guinea-Bissau, 1999–2009
After nearly a decade of conflict and political instability, Guinea-Bissau remains
fragile. Economic and social conditions worsened in the last decade, with per capita
incomes declining in most years. Guinea-Bissau is still one of the world’s poorest countries,
with more than two-thirds of the population living below the poverty line. This poor
outcome is inexorably linked to the political and social tensions that culminated in the
armed conflict of 1998–99, which left several thousands dead, displaced most of the
capital’s population, and caused wide-spread damage to infrastructure.
Early attempts at economic stabilization were not successful. The Fund provided early
support to Guinea-Bissau’s post-conflict reconstruction efforts, first through the emergency
post-conflict assistance (EPCA; 1999–2000), followed shortly thereafter by a Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility arrangement (PRGF; 2000–2003). Simultaneously, GuineaBissau reached the decision point for the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
Initiative. The ex-post assessment of performance concluded that divisive and erratic
policies led to further political tension and, combined with fragile institutions and little
technical capacity, to increased fiscal problems.1 The program went off track and after two
unsuccessful short-term staff-monitored programs (SMPs), the arrangement expired at end2003 without a review. Since then, the Fund has been involved in building capacity, two
SMPs in 2006 and 2007, and Emergency Post Conflict Assistance (EPCA; 2008, 2009).
Performance in the latest EPCA-supported program has met most quantitative targets and
most structural reform measures.
The main reasons for Guinea-Bissau’s performance shortcomings earlier in the decade
were: (i) constant changes in government and senior staff; (ii) lack of ownership and
commitment on economic policies at the highest levels of government; (iii) political
interference in expenditure management; and (iv) fragilities in technical capacity for fiscal
and macroeconomic management.
Guinea-Bissau’s recent success in stabilizing the fiscal situation and rebuilding
technical and administrative capacity with the help of the Fund and other
development partners has created conditions for renewed donor involvement. This in
turn will require the firm commitment and determination of the authorities to implement
credible reforms. The peaceful elections last year, completion of the annual progress report
on the PRSP in 2009 with the participation of civil society, solid economic performance in
the EPCA-supported program despite difficult circumstances, and the government’s
demonstrated commitment to stabilizing the macroeconomic situation have been important
tests of the country’s readiness to move to an ECF.

II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE EPCA
4.
In 2009 Guinea-Bissau stabilized its economy. Economic growth was resilient;
inflation slowed; and budgetary stability was regained:


Lower prices for cashews, the predominant export, and falling remittances depressed
incomes and exacerbated fiscal and balance of payments pressures. Still, with a favorable
cashew harvest and a pick-up in construction, real GDP growth is estimated to have
reached 3 percent (Table 1, Figure 2).



Lower food and fuel prices slowed inflation, and domestic inflationary pressures
remained subdued due to the CFAF peg to the euro. Private sector credit decelerated as
banks became more cautious about new lending (Table 2).



The external current account deficit (excluding grants) widened to 6½ percent of GDP,
but was largely financed by an increase in grants, so the overall external balance
deteriorated only moderately (Table 3). The higher deficit reflects a combination of lower
cashew prices, a surge in imports of oil and construction material, and a decline in
remittances.



Fiscal performance has been satisfactory (Figure 3). Tax revenues overperformed by
about 2 percentage points of GDP, reflecting the good cashew harvest and stepped-up
collection efforts. While through September Guinea-Bissau had received only 50 percent
of the budget support pledged, by year-end donor support exceeded programmed levels,
with disbursements from the WAEMU, the EU, and France. Meanwhile, the government
contained spending and kept domestic arrears within target.

5.
Despite the external and political challenges, program performance has been
satisfactory. All but two EPCA quantitative targets were met through
MEFP ¶8
December (Table 4). The ceiling on repayment of previous years’ arrears
was breached when the government decided to pay 2008 wage arrears. Nonregularized
expenditures grew temporarily because of the mid-year elections, but have since been
classified into the budget and the authorities are working to tighten norms with a view to
curbing them.
6.
Progress on structural reforms accelerated towards the end of last year, but
some targets were missed (Table 5). The government completed the biometric survey of
civil servants; approved the annual progress report on the PRSP; drew up the action plan for
public financial management (PFM); and enacted the new investment code. Of the other
measures, the government decided not to sign a contract with a pre-shipment customs
inspection company but to reinforce capacity locally, and there were delays on two other
measures: the automated system for customs administration will go into operation in three
customs posts (Bissau, the airport, and Safim) by July 2010; and the unified payroll and
payment system will be operational in two pilot ministries, the Ministry of Finance and the
Ministry of Labor and Public Services, by January 2011, after the required preparatory work
on unifying the public payroll is completed.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS AND MEDIUM-TERM PROGRAM
A. Overview
7.
Policy discussions focused on the authorities’ medium-term program and fiscal
and other structural reforms, consistent with the PRSP, that are critical for growth and
poverty reduction. Policy priorities are to:


Strengthen public finances, in PFM and other areas, with a view to containing the fiscal
deficit and supporting macro stability;



Normalize the government’s relations with domestic banks and the private sector by
addressing the large stock of domestic arrears;



Modernize the public administration to create space for priority spending and raise the
quality of public services;



Promote job creation by removing impediments to private sector development and
strengthening the provision of financial services;



Improve access to social services and step up efforts to alleviate poverty; and



Move toward debt sustainability, particularly by helping the country achieve the
HIPC/MDRI completion point.
B.

Macroeconomic Framework for 2010–12

8.
The main macroeconomic objectives of the government program are to (i) raise
real GDP growth to 4½ percent by program end; (ii) contain annual inflation below 3
percent, the WAEMU convergence norm; and (iii) gradually narrow the external current
account deficit (excluding official transfers). The program is designed to keep the domestic
primary budget deficit below 4 percent of GDP annually through 2012.


Real GDP growth is projected to accelerate to 3½ percent in 2010 (Figure 4). The modest
recovery is expected to be driven by the projected rebound in the global economy and its
positive impact on the terms of trade and cashew prices; spillovers from the global
recovery through higher remittances; the positive impact of a stabilizing political and
security environment on the business climate; and continued large donor-funded public
investment projects. Over the medium term, a broad range of structural reforms is needed
to raise growth to 4−5 percent. The pick-up would be driven by sustained cashew
production; expanded and diversified agriculture, increased activity in cashew nut
processing and industrial fishing; and a steady rebuilding of infrastructure, especially
roads, electricity, and water.



Beginning in 2010 and into the medium term, inflation is expected to be in line with the
WAEMU convergence norm, below 3 percent, as the effects of commodity price changes
wane and the CFA peg to the euro has a stabilizing effect. Monetary and exchange rate
policy will continue to be pursued within the framework of the WAEMU. This
arrangement has enabled Guinea-Bissau to contain inflation and keep the exchange rate
stable.



The external current account deficit (excluding grants) is projected to narrow gradually
over the medium term to about 5 percent of GDP, as cashew prices and export volumes
trend upward and remittances rise. The overall balance of payments (excluding grants) is
projected to be in deficit throughout, with small financing gaps over the medium term
expected to be covered by donor support and the ECF arrangement.

9.
The medium-term economic outlook is subject to substantial uncertainty.
Downside risks could arise from weaker-than-expected export prices, lower-than-expected
fiscal spending due to financing constraints, and unexpected political disruptions. Upside
risks stem from an unexpected impact of government settling outstanding arrears (see
below)—generating additional liquidity in the economy—and a surge in business confidence
based on a more stable political climate and firmer commitment to policy implementation.
C. Strengthening Public Finances
Medium-term fiscal program
10.
The authorities’ medium-term fiscal program is directed to firming up the fiscal
position and achieving debt sustainability. The strategy seeks to heighten
MEFP ¶12
revenue collection—low by regional standards; make space for priority
spending; keep current-year spending within available resources; and start to address
domestic arrears. The fiscal program reduces the domestic primary deficit gradually to 3½
percent of GDP by 2012 (Table 6). Combined with HIPC/MDRI debt relief (see below, ¶ 35),
this should improve fiscal and debt sustainability while limiting reliance on external budget
support.
11.
The 2010 budget is an important move forward. The budget introduces strong
revenue measures, especially by restoring custom duties on certain products, keeps current
year spending within available resources, and protects priority spending. It targets a domestic
primary budget deficit of just under 4 percent of GDP (text table), consistent with expected
donor support and without adding to Guinea-Bissau’s debt. Total revenues are expected to
increase by 1¼ percentage points of GDP as customs duties on certain products are restored
and there are one-off increases in EU fishing compensation.1 Domestic primary spending is

projected to rise by about 2¼ percentage points of GDP, reflecting higher capital outlays on
infrastructure (about 1½ percent of GDP) and targeted increases in education, health, and
agriculture.2 The higher current spending is modest compared to the need to improve basic
services after years of post-conflict neglect.3 Budget support of CFAF 13 billion is expected

Structural reforms to strengthen public finances
12.
The government reform program to strengthen public finances centers on
mobilizing revenue and improving spending controls and other areas of public financial
management.
Mobilizing revenue
13.
Staff and authorities agreed that collecting more revenue is a priority. A major
element of the persistent fiscal imbalances in Guinea-Bissau is how
MEFP ¶19-20
little revenue it brings in compared with other sub-Saharan African
countries, including its WAEMU peers. Tax revenue in Guinea-Bissau has averaged about
6 percent of GDP for the last five years while the WAEMU average is about 15 percent.
Revenues depend heavily on tax collection at customs, with export and import duties and
sales tax on imports accounting for about 60 percent of total domestically generated
revenues. In the short term, government efforts to mobilize revenues focus on restoring

customs duties for certain products, improving customs and tax administration (structural
benchmark, July 2010), and broadening the tax base. In the medium term, government plans
include shifting to a value-added tax (VAT) in line with other WAEMU countries, and
revisiting revenue-sharing agreements (“restitutions”) to eliminate de facto earmarking of
resources.
Deepening public financial management reforms
14.
The government’s public financial management reforms initially focus on
reinforcing budget monitoring and execution and the spending control apparatus, with
the specific short-term goal of achieving and maintaining fiscal discipline.
Government plans reflect extensive technical assistance and support received
MEFP ¶21
from the IMF and development partners in recent years, including the World
Bank in the context of a Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability
Review (PEMFAR); the AfDB; the EU; and bilateral donors. Beginning in 2010 the
government will start implementing the PFM action plan, approved by the council of
ministers last year, which specifies measures to strengthen budget preparation and execution
and cash flow management, and make payroll controls more effective. Three short-term goals
are to:


Reinforce standard budget execution procedures, avoiding “simplified” ones for
significant portions of the budget (structural benchmark, May 2010). Supporting
documentation will need to be systematically provided to Treasury officers charged with
making payments, so that a crucial control link between budget and treasury functions is
routinely observed.



Improve cash management, moving away from daily allocation of funds which does not
ensure that adequate cash is available to pay for expenditures when they are due
(structural benchmark, June 2010). This, combined with strict implementation of the
single Treasury account, should help reduce the risk of arrears accumulation.



Better integrate budget preparation and execution, and improve monitoring of budget
execution and Treasury operations (structural benchmark, July 2010).

15.
Staff welcomed other goals of PFM reforms, including greater efficiency in
public spending and more effective accountability. Efforts in these areas include ex-ante
control of all government budget expenditures; strengthening accounting and reporting
procedures and better disseminating financial statements; and reinforcing procurement by
harmonizing current legislation with WAEMU standards.
D. Medium-term Plan to Address Domestic Arrears
16.
The authorities have prepared and begun implementing a medium-term plan to
address the large stock of domestic arrears (see Table 7 and Box 2 for a
MEFP ¶14
breakdown). The plan should help restore economic confidence, improve
liquidity in the banking system, and alleviate social tensions. The plan has two steps. In the

17
first step, it addressed verified arrears. These include arrears to commercial banks and the
BCEAO that entail high financial costs to the government, as well as wage arrears of 2008.
By January 2010, these arrears were settled with cash payments using available financing
consisting of donor support, domestic currency loans from the BCEAO representing a local
currency counterpart to the SDR allocation, and rescheduling. In the second step, the
government intends to start addressing verified arrears to the private sector up to 1999 and
complete the audit of 2000–07 arrears. This strategy is similar to the arrears clearance
strategy of peers within the region (see Box 2).
Box 2. Guinea-Bissau’s Arrears Problem
At end-2009, domestic arrears were about 23 percent of GDP (about CFAF 93 billion), composed of:
 Wage arrears: unpaid civil servant wages for 2008.
 Commercial bank arrears: Treasury bills that have matured since 2006, unpaid interest on them, and
other commercial bank loans—including capitalized interest payments. These are the most expensive
arrears, carrying interest rates of 6 to 13 percent.
 Arrears to the BCEAO: unpaid amounts from previous reschedulings with the BCEAO in 2009,
payments to the IMF by the BCEAO on behalf of the Guinea-Bissau government in 2008 and 2009,
and commissions to the WAEMU.
 Arrears to the private sector based on the results of the 1974–99 and 2000–07 audits. The
government has already paid some of the arrears identified in the 1974–99 audit, leaving some CFAF
17 billion outstanding. The 2000–07 audit is still preliminary, and the government plans to complete
it.
In January 2010, the government settled about CFAF 20 billion arrears to commercial banks, the
BCEAO, and the remaining wage arrears of 2008 using donor support, domestic currency loans from the
BCEAO representing a local currency counterpart to the SDR allocation, and rescheduling.
The origin of the arrears problem in Guinea-Bissau—weak public finances, in particular a low revenue
base, weak public financial management, and deterioration in public institutions, in the context of an
unstable political environment, combined with a suspension of external assistance—bears some
similarities with other countries in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the economic dimension of the arrears
problem in Guinea-Bissau is much larger than that of its peers in the region, especially relative to GuineaBissau’s lower per capita income and more challenging economic situation.
The arrears clearance strategy Guinea-Bissau is pursuing presents similarities and differences from that of
its peers:
Similarities: The strategy follows varying approaches depending on the class of creditors; arrears have to
be audited and fully verified before settlement; the government plans to offset arrears against tax arrears
owed to the government; payment to small private suppliers is envisaged; and rescheduling over a long
time horizon will be required, consistent with available financing.
Differences: The strategy does not anticipate the use of financial market instruments to settle arrears
because of the country’s difficult fiscal position and unsustainable debt. In addition, the strategy requires
addressing costly arrears to domestic banks, a feature not prominent in its peers.

18
E. Modernizing the Public Administration: Civil Service and Security Sector Reforms
17.
The authorities and staff agreed that their plan to pursue civil service and
security sector reforms would help create fiscal space for priority spending. At present,
the wage bill accounts for close to 60 percent of fiscal revenues compared to 20 percent precivil conflict, well above the WAEMU convergence criteria. The wage bill grew rapidly
early in the decade due to expansion of the payroll and to wage increases designed to
decompress the salary structure and integrate special allowances into wages, but in recent
years a salary freeze has been bringing it down gradually. At about 20,000 employees
(including civil servants, paramilitary, and military), Guinea-Bissau has the highest
proportion of public servants to population (about 13: 1,000) in the WAEMU (an average of
6-7: 1,000). Civil service and security sector reforms are crucial to ensure medium-term
fiscal sustainability, contain the wage bill, and create space for priority spending.
Civil service reform
18.
The authorities expressed their commitment to launch a targeted medium-term
civil service reform program aimed at achieving a more modern and efficient civil
service. It will reduce the size of the civil service and upgrade the qualifications and working
conditions for civil servants, which should increase the efficiency and
MEFP ¶23-25
quality of public administration. Specifically, the government plans to:


Prepare a medium-term schedule, removing from the payroll into retirement all
employees who exceed the mandatory retirement age; address the group of civil
servants who are in an excess pool of workers (“redundant workers”) for reinsertion
into the private sector, in the context of the EU Program to support Public
Administration Reform (PARAP); and dismiss workers who account for overstaffing.
The government will seek donor support for the reform, and use the savings in the
wage bill to help cover the cost of severance payments.



Implement stricter payroll controls and establish a more comprehensive payroll
database that will allow for regular updating, and verification of civil service
employment. Initial efforts in 2010 will focus on verifying data from the biometric
census of civil servants with a view to identifying “ghost” workers (structural
benchmark, June 2010), and cross check and update the database of the Ministry of
Finance with data from the census.



Introduce effective management and increase productivity by providing performance
incentives, restructuring the job grading system, and enhancing training, including
through a new school of public administration, with the help of donors.

19
Security sector reform
19.
The government is also committed to modernizing and restructuring the defense
and security sectors, including by demobilizing excess troops. The
MEFP ¶26
objective is to reduce military forces gradually from 4,500 soldiers to
3,500, of which only 1,500 (about 30 percent) will be permanent once mandatory national
service is introduced. To reach the ultimate goal, about 2,200 soldiers will be retired and
about 800 will be demobilized by being formally discharged from the armed forces, without
the possibility of re-enlisting. The government also plans to rationalize the security forces,
with the National Guard incorporating several existing police forces. To enable the reform,
the authorities plan to create a pension fund, for which they are seeking donor support
equivalent to the additional pension outlays for the period 2011–2015 (about € 30 million).
Potential Fiscal Impact
20.
The potential medium-term impact of the envisaged civil service and security
sector reforms are illustrated by an alternative scenario with both reforms (Text Table
2). Since some parameters of these reforms have yet to be defined by the authorities, these
scenarios are illustrative only. The aim is to quantify the potential fiscal impact of the
reforms, the time pattern of costs and savings, and the donor financing that may be required.

F. Removing Impediments to Private Sector Development
21.
Staff and the authorities shared a common view that faster economic growth will
require government action on several fronts to (i) improve the
MEFP ¶27-30
business environment; (ii) reform the judicial system; and (iii) restore
and develop basic infrastructure in the areas of power, transportation, and communication.
22.
To improve the business and investment environment, the government will need
to speed up efforts of the National Commission on the Simplification of Administrative
Procedures. As an important first step, the government has made progress toward
establishing a one-stop shop for business, with World Bank support, with a view to
simplifying and facilitating the licensing and registration of new businesses (structural
benchmark, June 2010). The government is also preparing regulations to implement the new
Investment Code, providing for a level playing field for private investors.
23.
The government is committed to promoting good governance and increasing
transparency. In addition to procurement reforms, the government is working to enhance the
quality of the judicial system as part of an EU-supported program. Establishing a dedicated
tribunal will facilitate the settling of commercial disputes. There has been progress in
preparing telecommunications regulations and the government plans to draft a law to govern
the expanding telecommunications sector. Good governance and increased transparency
would also benefit from effective implementation of an anti-money-laundering and
combating the financing of terrorism framework consistent with international standards.
Consequently, staff encouraged authorities in their plans to make the financial intelligence
unit (CENTIF) operational and to enact legislation to combat the financing of terrorism.
24.
Planned government investments center on infrastructure for power, roads, and
the port. Presently, the installed power capacity in Guinea-Bissau is about half of what it
was a decade ago and is low by regional standards. Roads, railways, and the ports are
inadequate for the country to tap into its unexploited mineral resources (bauxite and
phosphate). To improve the infrastructure needed for private sector development, the
government will (i) improve capacity building and coordination with donors for more and
faster funding of infrastructure; (ii) increase fiscal space so that it can cofinance investment
projects; and (iii) review public-private partnership opportunities to reduce the infrastructure
deficit.
25.
Access to credit is still minimal. Insufficient access to financial services is reflected
in the limited supply of banking services and the low financial intermediation (ratio of M2 to
GDP). There are several structural reasons for this, including low population density, limited
purchasing power, and lack of financial data on potential borrowers, especially rural and
urban small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The microfinance sector is also
underdeveloped. The result is a financial sector that does not satisfy the financing needs of
the economy. On the positive side, the recent settlement of government arrears to domestic

21
banks improves their liquidity and increases the funds available for domestic credit
operations. The government is seeking donor assistance for making more credit available for
SMEs. With the banking system small, and international integration limited, the impact of the
global crisis has been modest, although there has been some increase in non-performing
loans associated with the financing of cashew exports (Table 8).
G. Improving Access to Social Services, Agriculture Policy, and Poverty Reduction
26.
A core objective of the authorities’ program is to make further progress toward
addressing the high rates of poverty prevalent in Guinea-Bissau in a
MEFP ¶31-33
manner consistent with the approach established in the country’s Poverty
Reduction Strategy. Increasing per capita income and reducing the incidence of poverty will
require efforts on several fronts, such as improving access to basic services (health and
education) and developing agriculture. This will require not only a deliberate effort in the
budget but also close cooperation with donors. In 2010–2012, the government is committed
to using at least 50 percent of tax revenues for current and domestically financed capital
spending in health, education, agriculture, and infrastructure (quantitative indicator). The
government has assessed its experience in implementing its 2007 PRS, and the lessons
learned will inform the successor three-year PRS which is currently being prepared for
completion in 2010.
27.
In the fight against poverty, agricultural development will be critical. Cashews
are the main source of income in rural areas, and cashew operations are labor intensive,
which distributes income widely. The contribution of agriculture to income generation could
be greatly amplified if Guinea-Bissau were to diversify its agriculture, reduce the need for
rice-for-cashew operation; and increase cashew sector value-added by processing more
cashew nuts and derivative products locally. In cooperation with donors the government will
pursue investment projects in support of land recovery and equipment, and the government
agricultural plan envisages the country gradually becoming self-sufficient in rice production.
H. Achieving External Sector Sustainability
28.
An analysis of Guinea-Bissau’s competitiveness and external sector
sustainability suggests some preliminary findings (See Box 3):


Guinea-Bissau’s current account deficit has been generally stable, despite some
gradual deterioration of the real effective exchange rate over the last decade.



Analysis using the standard CGER methodology produces estimates of the
equilibrium exchange rate around its current level.



Structural weaknesses are probably more important than the exchange rate in
explaining Guinea-Bissau’s lackluster productivity and economic growth, especially
the weakness of non-traditional exports.

22
Box 3. Guinea-Bissau: Assessment of External Stability and Competitiveness
Assessment of trends in competitiveness and external stability is complicated by several
aspects of Guinea-Bissau’s economy. These include aid dependence, high levels of external debt,
and dependence on a single export, prices for which are largely determined by weather conditions
and prices on international cashew markets.

The authorities’ objective is to achieve the HIPC and MDRI debt relief, which is
critical for improving medium-term external sustainability. Guinea-Bissau is in debt
distress; its debt ratios are well in excess of all sustainability thresholds. Although the
country reached the HIPC decision point in December 2000, macroeconomic instability
thereafter prevented it from proceeding to the completion point. At the decision point,
creditors pledged to provide debt relief equivalent to 85 percent cancellation in NPV terms,
but interim debt relief from the Fund and Paris Club creditors stopped after 2001, when the
PRGF-supported program went off-track. AfDB interim debt relief expires at the end of 2010
and IDA interim relief expires in early 2011. Since 2001, Guinea-Bissau has not repaid any
creditor that did not provide interim relief, except the IMF. A Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability
Analysis indicates that delivery of debt relief at the completion point, together with “beyond
HIPC” debt relief from Paris Club bilateral creditors, would significantly alleviate the debt
burden, bringing some debt indicators below policy–dependent thresholds after the
completion point. However, substantial debt vulnerabilities would remain (see the attached
DSA).
30.
To reach the completion point, Guinea-Bissau is required to observe the triggers
established by the IMF and World Bank Executive Boards when the decision point was
reached in 2000. Staff has initiated preliminary discussions with World Bank staff and the
authorities to review the status of implementation (Table 9).
31.
Guinea-Bissau has taken steps to regularize its relations with those external
creditors to which it has incurred arrears (Box 4). Financing assurances have been
obtained from Paris Club creditors. The authorities haves also been in contact with
multilateral and non-Paris Club bilateral creditors with a view to normalizing those financial
relationships.
Box 4. Guinea-Bissau: Normalization of Arrears to External Creditors
Guinea-Bissau is taking steps to regularize its arrears to external multilateral and bilateral
creditors, which at end-2008 stood at $388.6 million (see Table 2 of the Joint Bank-Fund Debt
Sustainability Analysis)—almost 40 percent of the country’s official external debt. The arrears
stem from the fact that, since 2001, the country has not repaid any creditor that did not provide
interim relief, except the IMF. Guinea-Bissau has no arrears to IDA and the AfDB, or the IMF.
The program assumes the continuation of interim relief from the World Bank and AfDB until its
expiry in early 2011, and the resumption of interim relief from the IMF, as requested by the
authorities.
Almost 90 percent of Guinea-Bissau’s arrears are owed to bilateral official creditors, and are in
the process of being rescheduled through the Paris Club. The program assumes that these arrears
are treated on Cologne terms and that comparable treatment is applied to non-Paris Club creditors.
Remaining arrears (about 10 percent of the total) are to multilateral institutions, other than the
IMF, World Bank, and AfDB. The authorities are committed to clearing their arrears to these
other external multilateral creditors during the period of the ECF program in a realistic manner
consistent with their payment capacity, and have been in communication with creditors to this
end. Given that Guinea-Bissau’s debt burden will remain high even after full delivery of HIPC
and MDRI debt relief, it is likely that a feasible arrears clearance agreement will need to take
longer-term rescheduling. The program thus assumes that minimal debt service will be paid over
the duration of the program.

24
IV. PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION
A. Program Financing for 2010–12
32.
The ECF arrangement would be part of a broad-based donor effort for GuineaBissau (text table 3). Total financing requirements for 2010–12 are projected at about CFAF
548 billion (US$ 1.2 billion), about two-thirds of which reflects HIPC/MDRI completion
point debt relief. About 9 percent is projected for program support to fill projected budget
gaps, with annual levels expected to be kept in line with the medium-term fiscal path. A large
part of the program financing is expected to be filled from Guinea-Bissau’s traditional donors
(E.U., the World Bank, the

for financing shortfalls.
B. Program Access
33.
In proposing ECF access, consideration has been given to Guinea-Bissau’s
substantial financing needs, the strength of the proposed program, the authorities’
efforts to put public finances on a sustainable path, and their commitment to its success.
Taking these factors into account, total ECF access of 157.5 percent of quota is proposed. In
accordance with common practice, access would include resources of 37.5 percent of quota
to allow disbursements for the 2008–2009 EPCA-supported programs to be re-financed on

25
more concessional terms.4 Net access is thus 120 percent of quota. The ECF is expected to
play a catalytic role, triggering significant donor support; at the proposed level of access, the
Fund would account for about 15 percent of envisaged donor support. Access will be phased
in equal installments across all the reviews of the three-year arrangement, matching expected
financing needs. A net amount equivalent to 18 percent of quota will be available to GuineaBissau after Board approval; the balance would be made available in equal tranches of 17
percent of quota after each of the six ECF reviews (Table 10).
C. Program Conditionality
34.
The program includes quantitative indicators and structural measures relate to
core areas of Fund expertise. The authorities and staff agreed on quantitative indicators and
performance criteria (Table 11) and on structural benchmarks that focus on fiscal
management (Table 12).
D. Program Risks
35.
Guinea-Bissau itself faces significant risks, but risks to the Fund’s resources are
moderate. The main concerns are political instability, vulnerability to external shocks, and
the possibility of inadequate donor support, including delays in donor disbursements.
Continued technical assistance will be vital to reinforce the authorities’ implementation
capacity. The country’s capacity to repay the Fund seems reasonably sound (Table 13). Risks
to Fund resources are mitigated to a significant degree by the BCEAO role as fiscal agent,
and its solid track record in making payments to the Fund, even without reimbursement by
Guinea-Bissau.
V.

STATISTICAL ISSUES AND CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT

36.
Guinea-Bissau has made great progress on national account statistics. In the
second quarter of 2010, the government will publish revised national account data for 2003–
08, based on the System of National Accounts (SNA93). The new data have broader
coverage of all sectors of the economy, and the result has been a doubling of GDP. The
government plans soon to start producing national account statistics based on SNA08, with
technical assistance from international and regional institutions.
37.
Capacity building is needed to complement fiscal reforms and ensure their
effectiveness and sustainability. Several partners, including the IMF, are providing
technical assistance in PFM and macroeconomic statistics. The highest priorities are
assistance to the Customs, Treasury, Budget, and Tax departments.
4

In the absence of early repayment of outstanding EPCA credit, the repurchase obligations of the outstanding
EPCA disbursements would begin in April 2011.

26
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
38.
Guinea Bissau is at a critical juncture. Relative political stability and government
determination to pursue a medium-term program of economic reforms in order to accelerate
growth and reduce poverty are welcome developments that should serve the country well.
39.
Despite the difficult external environment and a challenging political context,
economic performance under the EPCA has been quite satisfactory. Faced with delays in
donor support during 2009, the authorities restricted spending and exercised fiscal discipline,
while continuing to pursue their structural reform agenda.
40.
Moving forward with the government’s program of economic reforms and
adhering to the fiscal targets will improve medium-term fiscal and debt sustainability.
The program appropriately emphasizes strengthening public finances, modernizing public
administration, and removing impediments to private sector development. The well-placed
emphasis in the first year of the program on collecting more revenue, better controlling
budget execution, and improving PFM will lay the ground work for spending reforms.
41.
The government commitment to civil service reform and modernizing the
defense and security sector will be important to improve the public administration and
create fiscal space for priority spending. These reforms will support fiscal sustainability by
helping curb the wage bill. However, sustained donor support and sufficient concessional
financing will still be required, especially in support of progress toward the MDGs.
42.
The government’s initial steps in its medium term plan to address domestic
arrears helped inject needed liquidity into the economy and restore the credibility of
government policies. As planned, however, the government should carefully verify claims
and monitor budget execution as part of its strategy to address arrears.
43.
Satisfactory performance on the new ECF should help pave the way to the
HIPC/MDRI completion point in late 2010, which is central to securing debt
sustainability. It is important that Guinea-Bissau reach the completion point before World
Bank and AfDB interim debt relief expires. The authorities will need to satisfy the remaining
requirements to reach the HIPC completion point by regularizing relations with all external
creditors and meeting the completion point triggers. Their commitment to fill financial needs
exclusively with grant support and concessional financing will also be essential to help
Guinea-Bissau move toward a sustainable debt path.
44.
The support of donors and creditors for debt relief and program and project
financing is critical for implementing reforms and financing the government program
for 2010–12. The authorities have identified donor support for the 2010 program and expect
donor assistance to continue in line with commitments in recent years. Donor assistance
should be highly concessional, preferably in the form of grants. The authorities are
committed to pursuing fiscal adjustment to make up for financing shortfalls.

27
45.
The WAEMU exchange rate peg has given Guinea-Bissau a solid anchor for
macroeconomic stability. The objectives of raising its growth potential and securing a
competitive economy will require firm implementation of structural reforms to enhance the
business environment and diversify the economic base. Efforts to deepen financial markets
and improve access to credit, especially for SMEs, would help support these objectives.
46.
Staff supports the authorities request for a three-year ECF arrangement, based
on Guinea-Bissau’s performance on the EPCA, the strength of the authorities’ medium-term
macroeconomic program, and the government’s commitment to successful implementation of
the program.
47.

The next Article IV consultation will take place on a 24 month consultation cycle.

the shortfall. For the programmed quarterly amounts of external assistance (including EU fishing compensation) in 2009 see the TMU for EPCA 2009 (IMF Country Report No. 09/236),
¶ 12. If external financing specifically targeted to clear arrears is available, the ceiling will be increased for the full amount of the funds available.

5

Ceiling. At end-June and end-September, stock of accounts payable; at end-December, accounts payable accumulated during the current year (2009) and still outstanding one month
after the end of the year in the case of wages and other personnel expenditures (including pensions) and three months after the end of the year, in the case of nonpersonnel
expenditures. The ceiling on the accumulation of new domestic arrears will be adjusted in line with available domestic financing of the budget. In particular, if the government is not able
to increase (decrease) the domestic financing of the budget by the full amount of the shortfall (excess) in external budget support, the ceiling in the accumulation of new domestic
arrears will be adjusted upward (downward) by that difference.

6

Ceiling. Includes arrears in wages, transfers, and goods and services previous to 2009 and outstanding as of January 1, 2009. If external financing specifically targeted to clear arrears
is available, the ceiling will be increased by the full amount of the funds available.

HIPC Completion Point Triggers

Status of Implementation

Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
“A full PRSP has been prepared through a
participatory process and satisfactorily
implemented for one year, as evidenced by the
joint staff assessment of the country’s annual
progress report.”

The DENARP (Guinea-Bissau’s PRSP) finalized in 2006,
covering the period 2006-2008, was prepared in a
participatory process and builds on grassroots consultations
at the national level that involved all segments of society
(government, private sector, civil society, local communities,
and development partners). The PRSP was issued to the
Fund and Bank Executive Boards in April 2007 and
discussed by the Bank Board on May 10, 2007. The PRSP
is currently being implemented. The first annual progress
report of the PRSP was approved by the government in late
2009. A successor PRSP is now being prepared for
finalization in 2010.

Macroeconomic stability
“Continued maintenance of macroeconomic
stability as evidenced by satisfactory
implementation of the ECF-supported program.”

A PRGF–supported program was adopted in early 2000 but
went off track by the end of that same year. Since then the
government has had two staff-monitored programs, in 2005
and 2006, with mixed results. The Fund agreed on EPCA
supported programs for 2008 and 2009. Satisfactory
performance under the EPCA last year paved the way for
the government to prepare a medium-term program that
could be supported by an ECF arrangement in 2010-2012.

Governance
“Satisfactory progress in strengthening public
expenditure management assessed by the
release to the Parliament and the public, twice a
year starting in 2001, of comprehensive budget
execution reports. These reports also will allow
monitoring of basic education, primary health care
and military expenditures.”

“The action plan to reform the public procurement
system has been implemented and the new
system has been installed in all ministries.”

“The findings of the external audit to the 1997-99
budgets outturns have been submitted to
Parliament and an action plan of corrective
measures has been adopted

The government produced comprehensive budget execution
reports in 2002; however, this effort was abandoned in 2003
due to continued political and institutional instability.
As part of an effort to strengthen public expenditure
management, the government has begun implementing its
action plan to deepen PFM reforms. Quarterly budget
execution reports will be produced during the 2010 budget
calendar. The action plan to reform public procurement has
been implemented in five Ministries (Education, Health,
Finance, Agriculture, and Infrastructure), and extended to
the ministry of Defense through the World Bank LICUS
grant. Efforts are underway to extend it to the ministries of
Commerce and Industry; Economy; Fisheries; Transports
and Telecommunication.
The external audit of the 1997-99 budgets out-turns
financed by the Netherlands was completed in 2003;
however, its findings and recommendations are yet to be
approved by Parliament, and implemented by the executive.

38
Education Sector
“Elimination of fees for school books for all
primary education students (grades 1–4)
implemented in public schools.”
“Satisfactory implementation of the basic
education action plan, measured by an increase
in the gross primary school enrollment ratio to 61
percent”.

In 2002, free primary education was introduced in public
schools as part of the government’s broader Education For
All (EFA) program: tuition and book fees have been
eliminated.

The gross enrollment ratio increased from 53 percent in
1995, to 60 percent in 1999 and 102 percent in 2005.
However, the net enrollment rate in primary education is
only 45 percent. Gross and net enrollment rates are highly
divergent because of widespread delayed enrollment.

Health Sector
“Satisfactory implementation of the National
Health Development Program, measured by an
increase to at least 40 percent the proportion of
children under one year fully
vaccinated.“Adoption of an action plan for malaria
and its satisfactory implementation measured by
an increase to 15 percent in the use of insecticide
impregnated bed-nets by pregnant women.”

62 percent of children under one year were fully vaccinated
by end-2007. Guinea-Bissau is considered as a regional
benchmark on malaria prevention. Malaria action plan
adopted in 2002 allowed increasing the use of insecticide
impregnated bed-nets by vulnerable groups such as
children under five years and pregnant woman. 81 percent
of children under 5 and 72 percent of pregnant women were
sleeping under insecticide treated bed net by end-2007.

HIV/AIDS
“Adoption of a strategic framework to fight against
HIV/AIDS. At least 50 percent of the population at
increased risk (age 14–29) made aware of
transmission and prevention methods.”

Eighty-seven percent of 15- to 24-year-olds indicated that
they knew how HIV is transmitted (2006 survey).

Demobilization Program
“Demobilization has been successfully completed
and discharged combatants are being reinserted
into civilian life as established in the DRRP.”

Source: World Bank, IMF staff and authorities.

The government’s Demobilization, Reinsertion and
Reintegration Program (DRRP) was successfully completed
in 2006. The program demobilized about 4,000 excombatants by September 2003. The final phase of
reintegration was completed in 2006 and involved about
7,500 ex-combatants.

APPENDIX I
LETTER OF INTENT
Bissau, March 11, 2010
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
U.S.A.
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn,
1.
Guinea-Bissau made progress in stabilizing its economy in 2008–09 under the Fund’s
Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance (EPCA) program. The government is committed to building on
this effort and pursuing a medium-term economic program aimed at achieving fiscal and external
sustainability, reviving economic growth, and making progress toward poverty alleviation and the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). We hope this will help catalyze stronger donor support
and allow the country to move to the HIPC/MDRI completion point.
2.
As envisaged in the attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP), the
government medium-term economic program aims to strengthen public finances and implement
structural reforms in the fiscal and other areas critical for growth and poverty reduction. To support
our policies described in the MEFP, including assistance with our related balance of payment needs,
the government of Guinea-Bissau requests assistance from the IMF under an Extended Credit
Facility (ECF) arrangement in the amount of SDR 22.365 million (157.5 percent of quota), to be
disbursed in three years. The government requests the disbursement of SDR 7.881 million upon
approval of the arrangement, part of which will allow the early repurchase of Guinea-Bissau’s
outstanding EPCA credits of SDR 5.325 million. The government also requests the second tranche
of interim HIPC assistance in the amount of SDR 1.016 million to cover PRGF repayment
obligations falling due in 2010.
3.
The government firmly believes that the policies elaborated in the attached MEFP are
adequate to achieve the objectives of the ECF-supported program. However, if necessary it will
swiftly adopt additional measures to meet these objectives. The government will consult with the
Fund before adopting such measures or if there are changes in the policies contained in the MEFP,
in accordance with the Fund’s policies on such consultations.
The government authorizes the Fund to publish this letter of intent, the attached MEFP and
Technical Memorandum of Understanding, and the staff report and DSA relating to this request.
Sincerely yours,
/s/
José Mario Vaz
Minister of Finance

APPENDIX II
MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES FOR 2010-2012
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Guinea Bissau is at a turning point. Following an extended period of political
instability in the aftermath of the 1999 civil war, the Presidential election of September last
year, and the civilian government of Prime Minister Carlos Gomes are significant markers
toward much-needed political stability. This has allowed the government to move away from
day-to-day business and to start focusing on developing and implementing a medium-term
strategy of economic development and poverty alleviation. The country remains largely
dependent on the agricultural sector, with a small domestic market and a narrow export base
vulnerable to shocks. Poverty is widespread, with about two-thirds of households living
below the poverty line.
2.
The government is committed to pursue a medium-term economic program for 2010–
12 that can help the country move towards fiscal and debt sustainability, as well as achieve
stronger economic growth and poverty alleviation. The program focus on strengthening
public finances; modernizing the public administration and rebuilding technical and policy
implementation capacity; increasing access to social services and basic infrastructure; and
developing the private sector. The program, which we are requesting be supported by Fund
resources under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF), is consistent with the country’s Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). Satisfactory performance under the program could pave
the way for Guinea-Bissau to benefit from debt relief under the enhanced Heavily Indebted
Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI).
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE EPCA
SUPPORTED PROGRAM
A. Recent Economic Developments
3.
In 2009, growth slowed due to a less favorable external environment and an unstable
political environment. Lower prices for the predominant export (cashews) and falling
remittances led to a significant slowdown in incomes and exacerbated fiscal and balance of
payment pressures. Still, with a favorable cashew harvest and a pick-up in construction
activity, real GDP growth is estimated at about 3 percent last year, slightly higher than
expected.
4.
On the external front, a drop of cashew export receipts driven by lower cashew nut
prices led the current account deficit (excluding grants) to deteriorate to 6½ percent of GDP
(preliminary data). Export prices were down nearly 30 percent, offsetting a strong growth in
export volumes amid the good cashew harvest (up 22 percent over 2008). Imports rose,

45
reflecting higher oil import volumes—despite lower average oil prices. Strong growth in the
volume of construction materials was an additional source of pressure on the import bill,
reflecting a pick-up in infrastructure projects. In addition to the deterioration in merchandise
trade, the evolution of the current account was also affected by the decline in remittances
(which represented about 4 percent of GDP in 2008). The increase in the current account
deficit was largely financed by an increase in grants, both project and budget assistance. The
result was a relatively modest deterioration in the overall balance.
5.
The general price level came down in 2009 in light of a decline in the import price of
food and the CFAF peg to the euro. Domestic inflation has remained subdued, despite a
looser monetary policy stance in the WAEMU region. Private sector credit decelerated
sharply reflecting a cautious approach by banks to new lending and a tight liquidity situation
in the banking system, overburdened by a large stock of public sector arrears.
6.
Guinea-Bissau continues to face a difficult fiscal situation. The low tax base and the
high expenditures as a percent of domestic revenues, by regional standards, make public
financial management rigid and leave almost no space to accommodate much needed social
expenditures. Despite recent improvements in revenue and expenditure management, the
financing of the budget continues to rely heavily on external budget support.
7.
Fiscal performance, however, has been satisfactory despite the difficult external
environment and unfavorable political situation. Better-than-expected revenue collection
throughout the year partly compensated for delays in donor financing. Tax revenues
overperformed by about 2 percentage points of GDP, reflecting the good cashew harvest and
stepped up collection efforts. While through September Guinea-Bissau had received only 50
percent of the budget support pledged, by year-end donor support exceeded program levels
with disbursements from the WAEMU, the EU, and France. Meanwhile, the government
contained spending and kept domestic arrears within target.
B. Performance under the EPCA Program
8.
All but two EPCA quantitative assessment criteria were met through December. The
ceiling on repayment of previous years’ arrears was breached when the government decided
to pay off 2008 wage arrears; non-regularized expenditures temporarily grew because of the
mid-year elections, but have since been classified into the budget and the government is
working to tighten norms with a view to curb them.
9.
Progress on structural reforms accelerated toward the end of last year, but some
targets were missed. The government has completed the biometric survey for civil servants;
approved the annual progress report on the PRSP; drawn up the action plan for public
financial management, and enacted the new investment code. Of the other measures, the
government decided not to sign a contract with a pre-shipment customs inspection company
and there were delays on two other measures. The automated system for customs
administration will now be put into operation in three customs posts (Bissau, the airport, and

46
Safim) by July 2010. The unified payroll and payment system will be operational in two pilot
ministries, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Labor and Public Services, by January
2011.
III. Policy Priorities and Main Objectives of Medium-Term Macroeconomic Program
10.
The government’s medium-term program aims at providing the basis for GuineaBissau to achieve fiscal and debt sustainability, as well as stronger economic growth and
poverty alleviation.
11.
Key macroeconomic objectives of the government program are to (i) raise real GDP
growth to 4.5 percent by program end; (ii) contain annual inflation below 3 percent, in line
with the WAEMU norm; and (iii) achieve a gradual narrowing of the external current
account deficit (excluding official transfers). Over the medium-term, the pick-up in growth is
to be driven by sustained cashew production; expanded and diversified agriculture (including
rice); increased activity in cashew nut processing and industrial fishing, and steady
rebuilding of public infrastructure, especially roads, electricity, and water. Supported by the
exchange rate peg, inflation is expected to remain subdued, in line with global food and fuel
prices.
12.
The medium-term fiscal program will aim at strengthening fiscal policy and
achieving debt sustainability. The strategy seeks to strengthen revenues─ Guinea-Bissau’s
revenue collection is low by regional standards─ and make space for priority spending, while
keeping current year spending within available resources and starting to address domestic
arrears. The fiscal program reduces the domestic primary deficit gradually to 3½ percent of
GDP by 2012. This, combined with HIPC/MDRI debt relief, will improve fiscal and debt
sustainability while limiting reliance on external budget support.
13.
The 2010 budget is an important first step of the medium-term framework. The
budget introduces strong revenue measures (through the elimination of custom duty
suspensions on certain products), keeps current year spending within available resources, and
protects priority spending. The budget targets a domestic primary budget deficit of 4 percent
of GDP. Total revenues are expected to increase by 1¼ percent of GDP, due to elimination of
custom duty suspensions on certain products and one-off increases in fishing compensation
from the EU.1 Domestic primary spending is projected to rise by 2¼ percent of GDP,
reflecting higher capital outlays on infrastructure projects (about 1½ percent of GDP) and
targeted increases in education, health, and agriculture. The higher current spending is
modest compared to the needs to improve basic services.2 Budget support of CFAF 13 billion
1

EU fishing compensation will rise by 0.7 percent of GDP in 2010 to compensate for lower disbursements in
2009.
2

The higher current spending in 2010 also takes into account the costs of local elections later in the year,

47
is expected mostly from the EU, the AfDB, the World Bank, and bilateral donors. The
residual financing gap of CFAF 13.4 billion is expected to be filled by European
Commission Vulnerability-Flex grant resources under the 2010 exercise (up to CFAF 9.8
billion) and the ECF (CFAF 3.6 billion). For contingencies, the government has a general
budget reserve allocation of CFAF 0.5 billion, and the government is committed to further
efforts to reduce spending, or recover additional revenues, to make up for any financing
shortfalls.
14.
The government has prepared a medium-term plan to address domestic arrears.
Domestic arrears are sizable, and while estimates vary, the stock that has been identified
accounts for about 23 percent of GDP at end-2009. These include wage arrears, arrears to
domestic banks, the BCEAO, and commercial arrears to the private sector. Starting to
address those arrears in the context of a credible medium-term strategy will go a long way in
terms of restoring economic confidence, improving liquidity in the banking system, and
alleviating social tensions. The government’s plan has two steps. In the first step, it addresses
well-identified and verified arrears, and the most costly to the budget. These include arrears
to commercial banks and the BCEAO which entail high financial costs to the government, as
well as wage arrears of 2008. These arrears have been settled with cash payments using
available financing consisting of donor support, domestic currency loans from the BCEAO
representing a local currency counterpart to the SDR allocation, and rescheduling. In the
second step, the government intends to start addressing arrears to the private sector incurred
up to 1999 and to complete the audit of 2000–07 arrears. In 2010, the government will
carefully monitor budget execution and available resources before carrying out its plan of
paying individual claims of up to about CFAF 30 million, for a total of CFAF 3.5 billion, and
reschedule the remainder.
15.
The government hopes that satisfactory performance under a Fund-supported
program could pave the way for debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). Guinea-Bissau reached
the decision point under the HIPC Initiative in 2000, remains in debt distress, and has been in
arrears to external creditors that have not provided interim debt relief. The authorities are
committed to satisfying the remaining requirements to reach the HIPC completion point,
including regularizing relations with all external creditors and meeting the HIPC completion
point triggers. It would be important for Guinea-Bissau to reach the completion point before
World Bank and African Development Bank interim debt relief expire.
IV. ECONOMIC REFORMS
16.
The government’s program of economic reforms centers on strengthening public
finances; modernizing the public administration, creating space for priority spending, and
raising the quality of public services; and removing impediments for private sector
development.

48
Strengthening public finances
17.
The reform agenda to strengthen public finances aims to raise revenue collection and
improve public financial management.
A. Strengthening Revenue Collection
18.
A major element of the persistent fiscal imbalances in Guinea-Bissau is the low level
of revenue compared with other sub-Saharan African countries, including countries in the
WAEMU area. Revenues depend heavily on tax collection at customs (export and import
duties, as well as sales tax on imports). Customs is therefore a major force in the process of
tax collection, and measures to mobilize revenue will partly focus on improving customs
administration, especially import processing and customs clearance. But efforts will also be
required to broaden the tax base, including by shifting to a VAT in line with other WAEMU
countries; and reinforcing tax administration.
19.
To achieve its revenue collection targets, the government intends to work towards
modernizing and improving the customs and tax administrations.


On customs, the government plans to: (i) improve customs control and valuation by
upgrading and putting into operation the Automated System for Customs Data
(ASYCUDA ++) in all the main customs posts until June; (ii) introduce seals on
alcoholic beverages and tobacco to combat smuggling; (iii) strengthen controls on
warehouses and movements out of the port; and (iv) obtain better equipment for
custom enforcement.



On tax revenue, the government plans to: (i) strengthen controls of the sales tax by
better monitoring of customs points of entry; (ii) reinforce the large taxpayer unit in
the Ministry of Finance to ensure compliance with tax declarations; (iii) enforce the
requirement that enterprises have a proper accounting system (SYSCOA); and (iv)
better monitor small business tax payers, among others, through rigorous cross checks
with import data.

20.
The government aims to modify customs and tax policy with a view to enhancing
revenue collection and broadening the tax base. In addition to the elimination of custom duty
suspension on certain products (rice, wheat, sugar, cement, and other construction materials)
effective since January 2010, the government plans to (i) conduct a comprehensive review of
all custom exemptions with the goal to further broaden the customs revenue base; (ii) raise
the reference price for cashew exports to US$ 750 per ton; (iii) increase the tax rate on the
advance payment of the profit tax collected at customs (anticipation of industrial
contribution) from 3 to 5 percent; and (iv) start preparing for a transition from the general
sales tax to the VAT in line with other WAEMU countries. The move to the VAT will
eventually contribute to broadening the tax base, as it would be levied on all imported goods

49
and services, helping spread out the payment of tax through a large number of businesses
instead of being concentrated on particular groups. The government will request technical
assistance from the IMF on tax policy, possibly through a resident advisor, to support its
revenue mobilization efforts.
B. Improving Public Expenditure and Financial Management
21.
The government is committed to pursue public financial management reforms,
revamping the monitoring, execution, and control apparatus seeking to achieve and maintain
fiscal discipline; greater efficiency in public spending; more effective accountability; and
better ability to mobilize and absorb resources. Reforms will be pursued in light of technical
assistance and support received from the IMF and development partners in recent years,
including the World Bank in the context of a Public Expenditure Management and Financial
Accountability Review (PEMFAR), the AfDB, the EU and bilateral donors. The government
will implement its PFM action plan approved by the Council of Ministers at the end of 2009,
with measures focusing on better collection of tax payments, greater predictability in the
availability of funds, more effective payroll controls and management, stronger controls in
procurement, better dissemination of annual financial statements, and moving toward a
multi-year perspective in fiscal planning.
Better budget planning

All administrative revenues are now collected by the Treasury, but revenue sharing
agreements (“restitutions”) between the collecting ministries (including allocated
revenue from fishing, mining, and forestry; and administrative revenue such as
revenue from passport) and the Treasury have resulted in de facto earmarking of
resources. The government will review the legal framework that regulates restitutions
by March 2011 with a view to increase the share of nonearmarked revenues in the
budget.


The government will prepare in 2010 a medium-term expenditure plan in line with
the poverty reduction strategy.

Greater predictability and control in budget execution

Standard budget execution procedures have often given way to non-standard or
“simplified” ones to execute significant portions of the budget. Supporting
documentation is not systematically provided to Treasury officers charged with
making payments so that a crucial link between budget and treasury functions and the
associated controls is routinely severed. The government will implement norms
tightening the recourse to simplified spending procedures, with the goal that
emergency spending is regularized within five days.


Cash management has been done through a daily allocation of funds which does not
ensure that adequate cash is available to pay for expenditures when they are due. This

50
involves a risk of arrears accumulation, which could be exacerbated if the Treasury
single account is not implemented rigorously. The government will strengthen the
Treasury committee in the Ministry of Finance, tasked to prepare and control a
quarterly and monthly Treasury plan with accurate and timely short term estimates of
cash inflows and outflows, to improve cash flow management. The Treasury plan for
the 2010 budget will be finalized by June 2010. The government will also ensure the
proper functioning of the single Treasury account.


The government will make its financial management system (SIGFIP) fully
operational, integrating budget preparation and execution and using it for monitoring
budget execution and Treasury operations. The budget preparation module
(administrative account) is already operational; the accounting system at the Treasury
will become operational by July; and connections to the customs and tax
administration, with full accounting of commitments and payment orders, will be
operational by December 2010.

Strengthening accounting, recording, and reporting procedures

The government will strengthen the unit of public debt management, with a view to
improving debt monitoring, including through the full use of the public debt
management system (SYGADE).


A new public finance law was approved by the Council of Ministers and it is
expected to be approved by Parliament in June 2010.



The government will continue to produce quarterly budget execution reports and
strengthen their preparation using SIGFIP, and will publish and send them to the
National Assembly.

Reinforcing internal and external controls

The financial control unit (FCU), which conducts an ex-ante control of all
government budget expenditure (i.e., before commitment, and before authorization)
has been put directly under the Minister of Finance. This eliminates the conflict of
interest with the budget directorate, allowing the FCU to better control and supervise
the financial directorates in line ministries. By June, the government will approve a
new organizational chart for the FCU, and will assign a number of delegates to line
ministries.


The government will modify the organic law for the Audit Court to harmonize it with
the WAEMU directives. It will also work to submit on a timely basis to the Court of
Accounts the budgetary execution accounts to be approved annually, which will
thereafter be submitted to the National Assembly.

51


Following the review of public procurement procedures, in the context of the World
Bank PEMFAR, the government identified the need to update the existing
procurement code with a view to harmonize it with WAEMU standards; and to
establish a procurement regulatory body, with representatives from public and private
sectors and the civil society, to supervise public procurement.
C. Modernizing the Public Administration and Raising the Quality of Public Services

22.
Civil service and public administration reform will be key to ensure medium-term
fiscal sustainability and improve the quality of public administration. At present, the wage
bill accounts for close to 60 percent of fiscal revenues, compared to 20 percent a decade ago,
and well above the WAEMU convergence criteria. The wage bill grew rapidly earlier in the
decade due to expansion of payroll and wage increases designed to decompress the salary
structure and to integrate special allowances in wages, but it has declined gradually in recent
years driven by a salary freeze. At about 20,000 public sector employees (including civil
servants, paramilitary, and military, preliminary figures), the proportion of public servants in
the population is the highest in the WAEMU region (about 13 public employees/thousand
inhabitants, compared to 6-7 for the region).
23.
The government will launch a broad civil service reform program aimed at achieving
a more modern, efficient civil service. The reform will (i) significantly reduce the size of the
civil service; and (ii) increase the efficiency of public administration by upgrading the
qualifications and working conditions for civil servants. The Minister of Public Service and
Labor is preparing a plan of action to be submitted to the Council of Ministers by end-2010.
The plan will include a medium-term schedule with annual targets to downsize the civil
service through mandatory retirement and removing redundant workers beginning in 2011.
Key objectives will be to remove from the payroll into retirement all employees who exceed
the mandatory retirement age; address the group of civil servants included in the excess pool
of workers for reinsertion into the private sector, in the context of the EU Program to support
Public Administration Reform (PARAP); and dismiss workers who account for overstaffing.
The government will seek donor support for the civil service reform, and will use the savings
in the wage bill to help cover the cost of severance payments.
24.
To allow for adequate control, regular updating, and verification of civil service
employment, the government is working to implement stricter payroll controls and establish
a more comprehensive payroll database. By end-June, the government will (i) publish the
verified data of the biometric census of civil servants and (ii) start paying the highest salaries
through the banking system. By end-2010, the government will cross check and update the
database of the Ministry of Finance with data from the census. By January 2011, the
government will start using the computerized and unified payroll and personnel management
system, and pilot it in the ministries of Finance and Public Service. The system will be
extended to most ministries by March 2011.

52
25.
Beyond reducing and enhancing control of the public sector wage bill, the public
administration reform, to be supported by donors, is aimed also at improving the quality of
public services. The government plan will focus on introducing effective management and
control of public personnel expenditures; and increasing productivity by providing
performance incentives, restructuring the job grading system, and enhancing training and
management, in coordination with donors. A new school of public administration will be
established with the help of the AfDB.
26.
The government is also committed to modernizing the defense and security sector and
restructuring it, including by demobilizing excess troops. The cost of defense and security
forces is about 1/3 of the wage bill and the government is committed to reducing the burden
on the budget of these large forces. The government effort comes after the demobilization,
reinsertion, and reintegration program (DRRP) pursued at the end of the civil conflict in
1998-99; and follows the census of the armed forces conducted in 2008. A key specific
objective is to reduce military forces gradually from 4500 soldiers to 3500 soldiers, of which,
only 1500 (about 30 percent) will be permanent with the introduction of mandatory national
service. This will be accomplished through retirement (about 2200) and demobilization for
reinsertion into the private sector (about 800), with participants formally discharged from the
armed forces, without the possibility of enlisting again. In addition, the government plans to
rationalize the security forces, including the police, with the National Guard incorporating
the several existing police forces. The government will create a pension fund, with the help
of donors. The government is committed to partly using annual savings to the budget from
retirement and demobilization to strengthen the pension fund. A broad donor coordination
effort is underway to facilitate the mobilization of financing.
D. Improving the Environment for Private Sector Development
27.
The government program to remove impediments to private sector development has
four main objectives: (i) improving the business environment; (ii) reforming the judicial
system; (iii) restoring and developing basic infrastructures, in the areas of, power,
transportation, and communication; and (iv) improving access to credit.
28.

To improve the business and investment environment, the government will:



Adopt the implementing regulations of the new Investment Code, which removes the
multiplicity of investment regimes, eliminates the discretion of granting incentives
under the old law, and provides for a level playing field for private investors.



Speed up the work of the National Commission on the Simplification of
Administrative Procedures, led by the Minister of Economy. The commission will
present to the Council of Ministers a set of measures by June 2010 identifying and
removing impediments to private sector development and improving the ease of
doing business in Guinea-Bissau. As an important first step, the government has made

53
progress towards establishing a one-stop shop for business, with World Bank support,
and plans to have it approved by the Council of Ministers by June 2010. The onestop-shop will be operational by the end of the year, with a view to simplifying and
facilitating licensing and registration procedures for new businesses.
29.
The government is committed to promoting good governance and increased
transparency. In addition to procurement reforms (discussed above), the government will
pursue reforms aimed at improving the quality of the judicial system in the context of an EU
program of support in this area. The establishment of the commercial tribunal will facilitate
the settling of commercial disputes. There has been progress on preparing the regulatory
framework for telecommunications, and the government plans to put in place a
telecommunications law that provides the legal framework for a rapidly expanding sector.
30.
The government program of investments will focus on infrastructure for power,
roads, and the port. The government will (i) improve capacity building and coordination with
donors for broader and faster funding of infrastructure rehabilitation and expansion; (ii)
increase fiscal space to cofinance investment projects; and (iii) review opportunities under
the public-private partnership legal framework.


The focus on infrastructure is on areas needed for private sector development. This
includes projects that would allow the country to reduce the cost of existing
operations (e.g., poor capacity of the port of Bissau), as well as projects that would
allow the country to tap into its unexploited mineral resources (bauxite and
phosphate), including possibly the need for a deep water port and railways. The
Ministry of Economy will conduct studies in this area, including to inform and help
better prepare its public investment program.



To sustain spending on infrastructure it will be important to create fiscal space by
containing non-priority discretionary spending, for much needed domestically
financed capital spending and co-financing operations. The government will also
reinforce the coordination of information across ministries to allow for better
monitoring of execution of its Public Investment Program.



The government will avail itself of the legal framework for public-private
partnerships (PPP), put in place last year with support from the World Bank, with a
view to reducing the infrastructure deficit in sectors such as ports, railway
transportation, and energy. Effective use of public-private partnership legal
frameworks will require not only improving the investment climate for potential
investors, but also making sure that rebuilding and new infrastructure are in line with
the capacity to pay for maintenance and operations; and do not create undue fiscal
risks for the government.

54
E. Improving Access to Social Services, Agriculture Policy, and Poverty Reduction
31.
The government aims to make further progress towards addressing the high rates of
poverty prevalent in Guinea-Bissau, in a manner consistent with the approach established in
the country’s Poverty Reduction Strategy. Increasing per capita income and reducing the
incidence of poverty will require efforts in several fronts, including improving access to basic
services (health and education) and agricultural development as most of the poor living in
rural areas and practicing subsistence agriculture. The government has assessed its
experience in implementing its 2007 PRS, and the lessons learned will inform the successor
three-year PRS that is currently being prepared for completion in 2010.
32.
Subject to further elaboration in the PRS, investments in the health and education of
the population and the delivery of basic services will be government priorities. The low
quality of basic social services in Guinea-Bissau reflects a lack of, and weak management of,
resources. The government is committed to gradually increasing and sustaining spending on
social sectors, health and education, with a view to not only providing the basis for economic
development by enhancing the capacities of the poor but also to contributing to poverty
reduction and lowering the vulnerability of the poor. This will require a deliberate effort in
the budget, but also close cooperation with donors, including the World Bank, with a view to
expanding the available resources in these areas. In 2010–2012, the government is committed
to using at least 50 percent of tax revenues for current and domestically financed capital
spending in health, education, agriculture, and infrastructure.
33.
In the fight against poverty, agricultural development will also be critical. As
Amilcar Cabral once said, in Guinea-Bissau agriculture is not only the basis of the economy,
agriculture is the economy itself. Cashew nuts are the main source of income in rural areas,
and operations in the cashew sector are labor-intensive, with income widely distributed
among the population. The agricultural sector contribution to income generation could be
greatly amplified if Guinea-Bissau were to diversify its agriculture, reduce the need for ricefor-cashew operations; and add value to the cashew sector by greater processing of cashew
nuts and derivative products locally. In cooperation with donors the government will pursue
investment projects in support of land recovery and equipment, and the government
agricultural plan envisages the country gradually becoming self-sufficient in rice production.
F. Financial Sector and Monetary Policies
34.
Monetary policy will continue to be pursued within the framework of GuineaBissau’s participation in the WAEMU, an arrangement that has enabled the country to
contain inflation and maintain a stable exchange rate.
35.
Access to credit is still low. The settlement of government arrears to domestic banks
improves their liquidity position and available funds for domestic credit operations. The
government is seeking donor assistance for improving availability of credit for small and
medium size enterprises. To help combat money laundering, the government will present a

55
law to combat the financing of terrorism to the Council of Ministers in June 2010, and it will
better equip the National Center for the Treatment of Financial Information (CENTIF).
G. External Debt Management
36.
Guinea-Bissau has been in debt distress for many years, and has accumulated sizable
arrears to external creditors. The government will act in good faith to regularize its relations
with its external creditors. It intends to improve its debt management capacity and
organization. The government will maintain communication with those creditors to which it
has arrears, aimed at reaching agreements that would allow it to normalize relations in a
manner consistent with the country’s debt service capacity.
37.
The government will pursue a prudent debt management strategy. For the full
duration of the three year program, the government will not contract or guarantee any
nonconcessional or short-term external debt, as defined in the Technical Memorandum of
Understanding (TMU). Moreover, the government will refrain from all external borrowing
on non-concessional terms, and any government or government-guaranteed borrowing
(external or domestic) will be subject to prior approval by the Finance Minister.
38.
Achieving HIPC and MDRI debt relief will be critical for improving medium-term
external sustainability. Guinea-Bissau reached the HIPC decision point in 2000. At that time,
creditors pledged to provide debt relief equivalent to 85 percent cancellation in NPV terms.
However, interim debt relief by the Fund and Paris Club creditors stopped after 2001, when
the PRGF-supported program went off-track. The African Development Bank (AfDB) and
IDA continue to provide interim debt relief, which expire at end-2010 and early 2011,
respectively. Since 2001, Guinea-Bissau has not repaid any creditor that did not provide
interim relief, with the exception of the IMF. Reaching the HIPC completion point and
receiving MDRI debt relief would significantly reduce the burden of debt. It is crucial
however, that Guinea-Bissau reaches the completion point by the end of 2010, before World
Bank and African Development Bank interim debt relief expire. In the months ahead, the
government will assist the efforts by the IMF and the World Bank to update the existing
HIPC completion point triggers.
H. Statistics
39.
The government will publish revised national account data for 2003–08, based on the
SNA93, in the second quarter of 2010. The new data have a broader coverage of all the
sectors in the economy, and have led to a doubling of the GDP level. The government plans
to start producing national account statistics based on SNA08, with technical assistance from
international and regional institutions.

56
I. Capacity Building and Technical Assistance
40.
Capacity building is a key complement to fiscal reforms in order to ensure their
effectiveness and sustainability. Several partners are providing technical assistance in areas
of public financial management as well as macroeconomic statistics. The highest priorities
are assistance to the Customs, Treasury, Budget, and Tax departments. The IMF is providing
technical support, including technical assistance from West AFRITAC and AFRISTAT, in
the areas of public financial management and national accounts statistics.
J. Program Monitoring
41.
The first year of the program covers the 12 months from January 1, 2010, to
December 31, 2010. It will be monitored using quarterly quantitative indicators and structural
benchmarks, as well as the semi-annual reviews and quantitative performance criteria
presented in Tables 1, and 2. Table 3 contains a list of main structural measures identified by
the government. The definitions of quantitative performance criteria and benchmarks are
provided in the attached TMU. We expect the first review to be completed by November
2010 and the second review to be completed by May 2011.

APPENDIX III
TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
Bissau
March 11, 2010
1.
This memorandum describes the definitions of the quantitative and structural
performance criteria, indicative targets, and structural benchmarks to monitor the
program supported by an arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF). It
also specifies the agreed periodicity and deadlines for transmission of data to IMF staff for
program monitoring purposes.
I. Quantitative Indicators and Adjustors
I. Quantitative Indicators
2.

The quantitative indicators are the following:
a. Cumulative floors on government tax revenue
b. Cumulative ceilings on the domestic primary fiscal deficit (on a commitment basis)
c. Cumulative ceiling on the amount of nonregularized expenditures (DNTs).
d. Cumulative floor on social and other priority spending
e. Cumulative ceilings on the change in net domestic financing of the budget
f. Cumulative ceiling on new domestic arrears of the government, including wage
arrears
g. Cumulative ceilings on new nonconcessional external debt contracted or guaranteed
by the government
h. Cumulative ceiling on new external short term debt.

Quantitative indicators are set for end-March, end-June, end-September, and end-December.
Quantitative performance criteria are proposed for end-June and end-December 2010 for
indicators (e) through (h). Indicators for new nonconcessional external debt, and new
external short term debt are continuous.
Definitions and computation
3.
For program purposes the government is defined as the central government of
Guinea-Bissau. This definition excludes public entities whose budget is not included in the
central government budget.

62
4.
The targeted floor on government tax revenues includes direct and indirect taxes,
as well as recovery of tax arrears and additional revenue efforts (Table 1).

The domestic primary fiscal deficit on a commitment basis is calculated as the
difference between government revenue and domestic primary expenditure on a commitment
basis (Table 2). Government revenue includes all tax and nontax receipts and excludes
external grants. Domestic primary expenditure consists of current expenditure plus
domestically financed capital expenditure, excluding all interest payments. Government
commitments include all expenditure for which commitment vouchers have been approved
by the Ministry of Finance; automatic expenditure (such as wages and salaries, pensions,
utilities, and other expenditure for which payment is centralized); and expenditure by means
of offsetting operations.

New domestic arrears of the government are defined as accounts payable (rest-apayer) accumulated during the year, still outstanding one month after the quarter for wages
and salaries (including pensions), and three months after for goods and services and transfers,
at end-March, end-June, end-September, and end-December 2010.
7.
Nonregularized expenditures are defined as any Treasury outlay not classified in
the expenditure tables presented by the National Budget Directorate.
8.
Net domestic financing consists of bank and nonbank financing (Table 3). Bank
financing consists of net changes in the balances of the Treasury accounts at the BCEAO
(excluding net disbursement from the IMF) and commercial banks (excluding balances in
those accounts that are not available for budget financing, such as accounts held under

63
double signature arrangements with donors) and in the outstanding amounts of loans,
including T-bills, from the BCEAO and commercial banks, local and regional. Nonbank
financing encompasses privatization receipts and any other financial debt held outside the
banking system other than new domestic arrears.

The indicators for external debt are cumulative ceilings on new nonconcessional
external debt contracted or guaranteed by the government. External debt is defined as
debt held by creditors outside the WAEMU region. For ECF purposes, the definitions of
“debt” and “concessional borrowing” are as follows:
a. The indicator for external borrowing applies to debt including commitments
contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been received. The term “debt” is
understood to mean a current liability, not contingent, created under a contractual
arrangement through the provision of value in the form of assets (including
currency) or services that requires the obligor to make one or more payments in the
form of assets (including currency) or services, at some future point(s) in time; these
payments will discharge the principal and interest liabilities incurred under the
contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones being (i) loans, that is,
advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of an undertaking
that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits, bonds,
debentures, commercial loans, and buyers credits) and temporary exchanges of
assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans, under which the obligor is
required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral
from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and official swap
arrangements); (ii) suppliers’ credits, that is, contracts where the supplier permits the
obligor to defer payments until some time after the date on which the goods are
delivered or services are provided; and (iii) leases, that is, arrangements under which
property is provided that the lessee has the right to use for one or more specified
periods of time that are usually shorter than the total expected service life of the
property, while the lessor retains the title to the property. The debt is the present
value at the inception of the lease of all lease payments expected to be made during

64
the period of the agreement, excluding those that cover the operation, repair, or
maintenance of the property. Under this definition of debt, arrears, penalties, and
judicially awarded damages arising from failure to make payment on a contractual
obligation that constitutes debt are also debt. Failure to make payment on an
obligation that is not considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on
delivery) will not give rise to debt. For the purposes of monitoring the ECF,
arrangements to pay over time obligations arising from judicial awards to external
creditors do not constitute nonconcessional external borrowing.
b. Loan concessionality, for program purposes, is assessed based on its calculated grant
elements. A debt is concessional if it includes a grant element of at least 50 percent,
calculated as follows: the grant element of a debt is the difference between the
present value (PV) of debt and its nominal value, expressed as a percentage of the
nominal value of the debt. The PV of debt at the time of its contracting is calculated
by discounting the future stream of payments of debt service due on this debt. The
discount rates used for this purpose are the currency specific commercial interest
reference rates (CIRRs), published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation
Development (OECD). For debt with a maturity of at least 15 years, the ten-yearaverage CIRR will be used to calculate the PV of debt and hence, its grant element.
For debt with a maturity of less than 15 years, the six-month average CIRR will be
used. To both the ten-year and six-month averages, the same margins for differing
repayment periods as those used by the OECD need to be added (0.75 percent for
repayment periods of less than 15 years, 1 percent for 15 to 19 years, 1.15 percent
for 20 to 29 years, and 1.25 percent for 30 years or more).
10.
Ceiling on short-term external debt newly contracted or guaranteed by the
government. Short-term external debt is debt with the contractual term of less than one year.
Debt-relief operations and treasury bills issued in CFA francs on the WAEMU regional
market are excluded from this performance criterion. In the context of the program, the
government and public enterprises will not contract, or guarantee, short-term external debt.
This performance criterion is monitored on a continuous basis.
11.
The concept of government for the purposes of the indicators on external debt is
broader than the one used for the budget aggregates; it includes all debt that may
ultimately be deemed to be a liability of the state. In addition to the central government, the
definition includes administrative public institutions; public enterprises authorized to
contract, guarantee, or accommodate nonconcessional borrowing; scientific and technical
public institutions; professional public institutions; industrial and/or commercial public
institutions; and local governments.
12.
Social and other priority spending is defined as total current expenditures in the
education, health, and agricultural sector, and domestically financed capital spending
(Table 4).

J. Adjustors
13.

The following adjustors will be in effect:
a. The ceiling on the domestic primary deficit (on a commitment basis) will be
increased in case of lower than programmed disbursement of EU fishing
compensation, by the amount of the shortfall up to a maximum of CFAF 3 billion.
The program assumes the following amounts of EU fishing compensation
(cumulative from January 1, 2010): zero by end-March; by end-June CFAF 4.59
billion; by end-September CFAF 4.59 billion; and by end-December CFAF 6.2
billion.1
b. The ceiling on domestic financing will be increased for any shortfall in external
budget support, and EU V-Flex and fishing compensation, by the amount of the
shortfall up to a maximum of CFAF 12 billion. The program assumes the following
amounts of external budget support, and EU V-Flex and fishing compensation
(cumulative from January 1, 2010): by end-March CFAF 5.3 billion; by end-June
CFAF 16.2 billion; by end-September CFAF 16.2 billion; and by end-December
CFAF 28.9 billion.
c. The ceiling on domestic financing for March, June, and September will be increased
for payment of previous years arrears in excess of programmed amounts up to a
maximum of CFAF 3.5 billion. The program assumes the following arrears
payments from previous years (cumulative from January 1, 2010): by end-March
CFAF 4.1 billion; by end-June CFAF 4.1 billion; by end-September CFAF 4.1
billion; and by end-December CFAF 7.9 billion.

For the purposes of the TMU, the CFAF/Euro exchange rate is 655.956 and the CFAF/US$ exchange rate was
updated to 450.

66
II. Program Monitoring
14.
To allow monitoring of the program, the Ministry of Finance will regularly
report the following information to the staff of the IMF:
a. Detailed reports on revenue and expenditure by budget line and a completed
summary table on central government operations (TOFE) (monthly, two weeks after
the end of the month)
b. Data on any extra budgetary expenditure, including (i) incentives to tax collectors;
(ii) restitutions to collecting agencies; and (iii) any other retentions operated by
collecting agencies (DGA, DGCI, Fishing Ministry, etc.) (monthly, two weeks after
the end of the month
c. Tables on nonregularized expenditures (monthly, two weeks after the end of the month)
d. Table on accounts payable broken down by budget category (wages, goods and
services, transfers, other) (monthly, two weeks after the end of the month)
e. Previous years’ domestic arrears (including 2009): stock and clearance, broken down
by budget category (wages, goods and services, transfers, other) (monthly, two
weeks after the end of the month)
f. The monetary survey, the balance sheet of the central bank, and the balance sheet of
commercial banks (monthly, within six weeks after the end of the month)

GUINEA-BISSAU
Joint IMF/IDA Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the Staffs of the International Monetary Fund and the
International Development Association
Approved by Roger Nord and Tom Dorsey (IMF)
and Sudhir Shetty and Sudarshan Gooptu (World Bank)
March 24, 2010
The 2010 debt sustainability analysis for low-income countries (LIC DSA) indicates that in
the absence of HIPC and MDRI debt relief, Guinea-Bissau is expected to remain in debt
distress, even though debt ratios would improve modestly in the medium-term. The latter
reflects the government’s medium-term macroeconomic program of reforms and fiscal
adjustment. HIPC and MDRI debt relief, which would flow if the HIPC completion point
were reached in 2010, together with additional debt relief by the Paris Club and other
bilateral donors, could help significantly alleviate the debt burden. Under such
circumstances, some debt indicators are expected to remain below policy dependent
thresholds after the completion point. Over the longer run, stronger export growth associated
with economic reforms and continued reliance on highly concessional financing is expected
to lead to a gradual decline in debt ratios to levels below the indicative thresholds. The
inclusion of domestic public debt in the analysis reinforces the conclusions of the external
DSA. The government’s economic program should focus on strengthening its fiscal stance;
on avoiding nonconcessional debt, securing foreign aid on highly concessional terms; and on
improving the political and business environment.
I. BACKGROUND
1. At end-2008, Guinea-Bissau’s total public debt amounted to US$1,361 million or
173 percent of GDP in nominal terms (144 percent of GDP in PV terms). Its largest
component is still public and publicly guaranteed external debt (78 percent of total public
debt) despite of public domestic debt having substantially risen over the last years (currently
22 percent of total public debt up from 19.7 percent in 2006 and 13.7 percent in 2000).
Public domestic debt declined in late 2009, however, as the government paid arrears to

2
commercial banks and the BCEAO using externally provided grants. Private external debt is
negligible.
Box 1. Impact of Revisions to Guinea-Bissau’s National Accounts
This DSA incorporates recently revised National Accounts data. The government will publish
the revised national account data for 2003-08, based on the SNA93, in the second quarter of 2010.
The new data has a broader coverage of all the sectors in the economy, including in particular the
non-cashew agricultural sector which had been significantly underestimated in previous data. The
result is an approximate doubling of the level of GDP. Accordingly, GDP ratios cannot be directly
compared to those in previous DSA exercises. As an approximation, the isolated impact of the
revision will be to reduce GDP ratios by approximately half. Export ratios are less affected, as the
revisions to export data were much smaller than for domestic sectors of the economy.

2. The stock of public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt amounts to
US$1,061.8 million (135 percent of GDP), of which US$388.6 million are in arrears
(Figures 1 and 2). In terms of composition, multilateral debt accounts for 47.5 percent of
total PPG external debt, whereof 27.6 percent is owed to IDA, 13.7 percent to AfDB/AfDF
and 0.8 percent to IMF. Bilateral creditors account for 52.4 percent (whereof 38.4 percent of
total PPG are Paris Club creditors).

3. Public domestic debt stood at CFAF 144.1 billion at end-2008 (or 38 percent of 2008
GDP) from CFAF 125.1 billion in 2006 (and CFAF 91.1 billion in 2000), mainly as a result
of new domestic arrears and new regional borrowing. By end-2008, the PV of public sector
debt had risen to 144 percent of GDP (up from 40 in 2006) and its ratio to revenue and grants
to 842 percent (up from 251 in 2006). Almost half of the domestic debt stock represents a
required capital contribution of CFAF 70 billion (21 percent of 2008 GDP) to join WAEMU
in 1998,1 which was agreed to be paid over 25 years starting in 2005 and of which CFAF
58.8 billion were left to be paid off. However, as the government has regularly only made
around 10 percent of the annual payments using distributed dividends, it had accumulated
CFAF 9.5 billion in obligations to the central bank (BCEAO). Another CFAF 6.2 billion in
arrears was outstanding to the BCEAO because of unsettled budgetary payments. The second
largest component of domestic debt is domestic arrears to the non-bank private sector, that by
end-2009 amounted to CFAF 71.8 billion.2 In addition, a commercial debt of CFAF
11.8 billion was outstanding to WAEMU banks, whereof CFAF 7.6 billion were Treasury
bills (issued in August 2006 at a face value of CFAF 6.7 billion). The obligation to the
regional development bank (BOAD) stood at CFAF 1.7 billion.

Under the terms of its accession to the WAEMU in 1998, Guinea-Bissau agreed to contribute an equal share as
all other members in the capital contribution of the central bank (BCEAO) and the regional development bank
(BOAD).

In gross terms, audited arrears account for CFAF 17 billion accumulated before 2000 and partially audited
arrears accounted for CFAF 54.8 billion accumulated during 2000–07.

4. Although Guinea-Bissau already reached the decision point under the HIPC
Initiative in 2000, it has failed to reach the completion point since. In 2000, the
government engaged in a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) program from the
Fund that could have paved the way to the completion point.3 Failure to maintain
macroeconomic stability caused the PRGF-supported program to go off track at a very early
stage. In 2005, the government agreed to a new timeline to re-engage in programs supported
by the IMF and the World Bank. Two Fund Staff-Monitored Programs (SMPs) followed in
2005 and 2006 as well as three disbursements under the IMF’s Emergency Post-Conflict
Assistance (EPCA) policy in 2008–09. Progress under both SMPs and the initial EPCAs was
mixed, although performance in 2009 improved significantly, allowing staff to recommend
IMF Executive Board approval of an arrangement under the IMF’s Extended Credit Facility
(ECF). Satisfactory performance under the ECF-supported program in the first half of 2010
would provide the necessary track record for reaching the HIPC completion point in the
fourth quarter of 2010. A full Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) was finalized in
2006 after many delays owing to political instability and capacity constraints. An Annual
Progress Report on PRS implementation was prepared in December 2009, and a new PRSP is
under preparation.
5. With the completion point not having been reached since 2000, Guinea-Bissau has
not benefited from most of the debt relief committed at decision point. At the decision
point in 2000, creditors representing 80 percent of Guinea-Bissau’s external debt pledged to
provide HIPC relief amounting to US$415 million in PV terms (currently estimated at about
US$579.9 million in nominal terms).4 But as Guinea-Bissau has failed to reach the
completion point since then, it has had to service a large share of external debt in full since
2001. Many agreements signed with other multilateral and bilateral creditors have not been
implemented because the country failed to remain current on debt service obligations.5 The
Paris Club declared null and void any debt rescheduling agreements beyond end-2001 and
the IMF suspended interim debt relief after the 2000 PRGF had gone off track. The African

3

A number of conditions must be met before a country can reach the completion point under the HIPC
Initiative, including satisfactory performance under an ECF or SCF arrangement. In particular, this requires
satisfying the Fund’s nontoleration of arrears policy (i.e. agreement must be reached on a repayment schedule of
all remaining arrears, among others the post-cut-off-date arrears with Paris Club creditors).
4

Additional US$71 million in PV terms (currently estimated at about US$133.3 million in nominal terms)
should come from an agreement with other bilateral creditors.

No. 05/93) Box 10, for a comprehensive list of debt.

5
Development Bank (AfDB)6 and IDA7 have committed to provide interim relief up to early
2011. Since 2000, only China and Cuba have cancelled all outstanding claims.
6. After the decision point in 2000, Guinea-Bissau could not service its external debt
and accumulated arrears to most of its external creditors. Since 2001, the country has not
repaid any creditor that did not provide interim relief, with the exception of the IMF. The
stock of external arrears has increased from US$141.7 million before decision point in
December 2000 to US$382.8 million at end-2008.
II. UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
7. The macroeconomic framework underlying the DSA is based on the implementation
of sound macroeconomic and structural policies, and external financing (mainly
through grants and highly concessional loans). Box 2 summarizes the corresponding key
macroeconomic assumptions. Growth projections average about 4.5 percent over 2009 to
2029. This reflects a stabilization of the political environment and the government’s intention
to raise the growth potential of the economy, mainly through investments in agriculture,
infrastructure and energy provision as well as efforts to improve the business environment
and to attract FDI related to investments in the mining sector. Over the medium and long
term, these efforts are expected to lead to fiscal consolidation and to stimulate significant
export growth that also outpaces any FDI-related import growth. Besides inflation, grants and
loans from donors as a percentage of GDP are projected to remain at historical levels.
8.
The DSA assumptions underlying the baseline scenario differ slightly from the
previous DSA undertaken in June 2009. They stem from updating key macroeconomic
variables in the short and medium term based on recent evidence, a newer global economic
outlook, stronger donor support, and indications of the authorities’ policy intentions in the
context of a prospective medium-term IMF program. The improvement in the fiscal balance
projected in the previous DSA for the medium-term is now expected to begin sooner,
reflecting the success of recent efforts to raise revenues and contain spending. The most
noteworthy medium-term difference is a more positive outlook for the external sector, with
6

The statutory ceiling for the delivery of interim relief was reached by AfDB in January 2007, so that only a
fraction of the scheduled debt service payments was covered through January 2007, and stopped thereafter. In
July 2008, the AfDB extended 100 percent debt service relief to January 2011 after having raised the interim
relief ceiling from 40 percent to 50 percent.

7

Interim relief from IDA amounted to 100 percent of debt service falling due between December 2000 and
October 2003 on debt disbursed before end-1999 (October 2003 was the originally assumed completion point
date). From November 2003, annual nominal reduction on debt service to IDA was 90 percent. In order to
further assist the country in reaching its completion point, IDA increased its limit on interim relief from 1/3 to
1/2 of the PV of debt relief to be provided. This interim limit of 50 percent of the PV of debt relief is expected
to be reached by March 2011.

6
the current account balance significantly stronger over the medium-term than was previously
assumed. In particular, long-term growth assumptions for the period beyond 2015 assume a
somewhat stronger growth rate of the dominant export–cashews.
9.
The simulations also assume that Guinea-Bissau receives financial assistance in
the form of a medium-term IMF arrangement. Assistance provided under the
arrangement is expected to equal 157.5 percent of quota (SDR 22.4 million) of which
37.5 percent of quota is used to immediately repay previous credit provided under the Fund’s
Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance Program. Disbursements under the arrangement are
approximately equally phased over the period from early 2010 to early 2013.
Box 2. Macroeconomic Assumptions Underlying the DSA Baseline Scenario
The macroeconomic assumptions over the period 2008 to 2029 are as follows:
Real GDP growth is expected to first drop from 3.5 percent in 2008 to about 3.0 percent in 2009
and then to gradually recover until it reaches 4.5 percent over the long term. This exceeds the
historical average by roughly one percentage point, reflecting a past marked by great political
instability and inappropriate macroeconomic policies which are expected to improve in the period
ahead. Growth is also expected to be supported by average growth over the 2015–2029 period of
about 4.5 percent in cashew production.
Inflation, as measured by the GDP deflator, is assumed to grow at a rate slightly below CPI
inflation, reflecting a continuous worsening in the terms of trade. Over the long term, both GDP
deflator and CPI are projected to return to their historical level of 2½ percent.
The noninterest current account surplus (including grants) is expected to decline gradually from
about 1½ percent in 2009 to about ½ percent in 2015—an improvement relative to the deficit of
2 percent of GDP observed over the 2000-2008 period. Over the longer term to 2030, real export
volumes are projected to grow at around 6 percent per year, contributing to a widening of the
surplus to about 4 percent of GDP before the end of the projection period in 2030.
The domestic primary fiscal deficit (i.e. revenue, excluding grants, minus interest expenditure,
excluding foreign-financed investment projects) is assumed to gradually decrease from 3 percent of
GDP in 2009 to about 2.5 percent from 2019 on, due to stronger revenues as a percentage of GDP
and improved public expenditure management.
Net aid flows (grants and concessional loans) are expected to moderate from the high levels seen in
2009. Budget support grants are projected to decline from the 7 percent of GDP received in 2009 to
about 4 percent over the medium term. Nonconcessional borrowing is expected to remain
negligible on the grounds that the country will not have continued access to commercial debt.
Fiscal financing gaps will thus have to be filled through grants or highly concessional loans,
especially since running further domestic arrears over the medium and long term is an
unsustainable alternative. The grant element in new disbursements is assumed to remain above
50 percent. Concessional loans are assumed to be on standard terms. It is assumed that most of the
current arrears to the regional central bank and to domestic commercial banks will be repaid using
externally-provided grants in the course of 2010.

7
10.
Assumptions governing the use of Guinea-Bissau’s SDR allocation (SDR
12.4 million or 4.3 percent of GDP) in the DSA reflect institutional arrangements
prevailing in the WAEMU area. In September 2009, pursuant to a decision by the
WAEMU Council of Ministers, it was agreed that the regional central bank would lend an
amount in domestic currency equivalent to the general portion of their SDR allocation to
WAEMU members to be used to clear domestic arrears. While such financing is loosely
associated with the SDR allocation—domestic financing by the BCEAO is linked to the CFA
franc counterpart of members’ SDR allocations—BCEAO loans to member countries do not
automatically trigger a drawdown of their holdings held at the SDR Department. The SDR
allocation held by the BCEAO has thus not been drawn down. The BCEAO domestic
financing has a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate of 3 percent and a repayment period
of 10 years. Accordingly, the DSA treats the funds provided by the BCEAO as domestic
borrowing, on the terms specified above. As the BCEAO continues to hold the SDRs
provided as part of the August and September 2009 general and special allocation, the DSA
does not assume any change in external debt service obligations resulting from the allocation.
A. Baseline: Interim Relief
11.
Under the baseline scenario, all PPG external debt indicator ratios fall relative
to their historical levels, but remain well above the policy-dependent debt burden
thresholds (Tables 1a, 1b and Figure 1a).8 The baseline presumes full delivery of
traditional debt relief as well as interim HIPC assistance, but that real GDP growth averages
almost 5 percent per annum in the long term.910 Despite the concessional nature of most of the
external debt, the debt burden indicators far exceed the relevant policy dependent debt
thresholds (Text Table 1).11 In terms of PV, external debt stands at US$855.5 million or
103 percent of GDP and 528 percent of exports. The downward trend in debt ratios through
the projection period is mainly driven by the assumption that Guinea-Bissau only takes out
highly concessional loans to finance fiscal gaps.12
8

Compared to the previous DSA, completed in June 2009, key debt ratios have improved significantly, owing
to the upward revision in GDP. That ratios still remain above policy-dependent thresholds based on the revised
data is testament to the level of debt vulnerabilities.
9

Traditional debt relief is assumed to take the form of a Naples flow rescheduling over the 2010–2012 period.

10

The underlying growth rates are approximately 2 percent higher than the historical average, with the historical
average calculated to exclude the sharp drop in GDP associated with the 1999 internal conflict. The reason is
that the past was marked by great political instability and inappropriate macroeconomic policies which are
expected to improve in the period ahead.

11

According to the World Bank Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), Guinea-Bissau is
classified as a country with poor quality of policies and institutions. Its average CPIA rating for 2003–08 is
2.58 on a scale from 1 to 6 and below the operational cutoff of 3.25 for poor performers.
12

The grant element of new external borrowing is projected to decline in 2010–14, owing to the lower
concessionality of the proposed borrowing under the IMF’s ECF.

2/ Threshold over which countries considered as poor performers according to their CPIA would have at least a 25 percent
chance of having a prolonged debt distress episode in the coming year. Guinea-Bissau lies within the bottom quintile of
countries ranked by CPIA.

B. Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
12.
Assuming that Guinea-Bissau reaches the HIPC completion point in 2010 helps
to significantly alleviate the debt burden, but some debt burden indicators remain at or
above thresholds consistent with a high risk of debt distress. (Table 1b, Scenario A3).
This alternative scenario assumes full delivery of HIPC, MDRI, and Paris Club “beyond
HIPC” assistance after the completion point. Over the longer run, stronger export growth
associated with economic reforms and continued reliance on highly concessional financing is
expected to lead to a gradual decline in debt ratios to below sustainability thresholds by the
end of the projection.
13.
Standard stress tests to the baseline scenario confirm the external debt position’s
vulnerability to unexpected shocks.13 Given current debt levels, the first stress test exhibits
the enormous impact of a one-time 30 percent devaluation in the nominal exchange rate in
2010 (Table 1b, Scenario B6): the PV of debt would increase by 39 percentage points of
GDP in that year. That makes the devaluation by far the most extreme shock in terms of
PV/GDP, debt/revenue, and debt service/revenue (Figure 1a). The prospect that such an
adverse shock would be realized, however, is limited by Guinea-Bissau’s membership in the
CFA franc zone, whose currency is pegged to the euro. The stability of the CFA franc versus
the euro is buttressed by high levels of reserves. At the same time, movements in the euro
versus other currencies in which Guinea-Bissau’s debt may be denominated (such as the US
dollar) could have a significant impact on debt burdens.

13

The 10-year historical averages used in the stress tests exclude the steep drop in GDP and disruptions to other
economic variables associated with the 1999 internal conflict.

9
III. PUBLIC DSA
A. Baseline: Interim Relief
14.
The baseline scenario, adapted from the same assumptions and consistent with
the external DSA, shows domestic debt indicators remaining elevated (Table 2a, 2b and
Figure 2a). Total public debt (domestic and external) as a percent of GDP declines steadily
through the projection period. The PV of total public debt to GDP ratio exhibits a similar
pattern. The debt service to revenue ratio rises in the second half of the next decade,
reflecting in part the repayment of the domestic credit provided by the regional central bank
in connection with the SDR allocation.
B. Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
15.
Under the assumption of the HIPC/MDRI completion point being attained in
2010 and the corresponding external debt relief being fully delivered (including MDRI),
debt vulnerabilities significantly decline (Table 2b, Scenario A4)14. The PV of debt would
fall to 50 percent of GDP in 2010, which amounts to a debt reduction of 77 percentage points
of GDP in PV terms with respect to the baseline scenario. Despite this reduction, the PV of
public debt to GDP would still remain high.
16.
Assuming that GDP growth and the primary balance move to their historical
averages (Table 2b, Scenario A1) has a modest adverse impact on debt ratios. By the
end of the projection period, the PV of debt to GDP ratio is elevated by about 43 percent of
GDP.
17.
Standard stress tests to the baseline scenario confirm that also the public debt
position remains vulnerable to economic shocks. As with the scenario assuming only
interim relief, the largest impact results from imposing a one-time 30 percent depreciation in
the exchange rate (Table 2b, Scenario B4), which severely impacts all debt burden indicators.
Perhaps the largest impact is with respect to the debt-to-revenues ratio, which rises by
42 percentage points (relative to the baseline) in the first year of the shock.
IV. CONCLUSION
18.
In sum, based on staffs’ analysis, in the absence of HIPC and MDRI debt relief,
Guinea-Bissau is expected to remain in debt distress, even though debt ratios would
improve modestly in the medium-term reflecting the government medium-term
macroeconomic program of reforms and fiscal adjustment. HIPC and MDRI debt relief,
which would flow if the HIPC completion point were reached in 2010, and comprehensive
14

The assumptions for debt relief from multilateral and bilateral creditors are the same as those described in
paragraph 12 above.

10
debt relief by the Paris Club and other bilateral donors, would help significantly alleviate the
debt burden, with most debt indicators below policy dependent thresholds after the
completion point. Over the longer run, stronger export growth associated with economic
reforms and continued reliance on highly concessional financing is expected to lead to a
gradual decline in debt ratios to below indicative thresholds by the end of the projection
period. The inclusion of domestic public debt in the analysis reinforces the conclusions of the
external DSA.
19.
Prudent macro policies are highly crucial for reining in debt ratios and for
performing under a potential new ECF, which is necessary to reach the HIPC/MDRI
completion point. The government’s economic program, for which it is requesting Bank and
Fund support, should focus on strengthening its fiscal stance; on avoiding nonconcessional
debt, securing foreign aid on highly concessional terms; and on improving the political and
business environment. The latter would not only be conducive for additional investment, but
also for a more stable inflow of external aid than in the past. Containing the wage bill and
avoiding off-budget expenditures will be key to reduce the current fiscal imbalance in a
sustainable fashion.

Safeguards Assessments:

The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is the common central bank of the
countries of the West African Economic and Monetary Union, which includes GuineaBissau. The most recent safeguards assessment of the BCEAO was completed on
November 4, 2005. The assessment indicates that progress has been made in strengthening
the bank's safeguards framework since the 2002 safeguards assessment.
The BCEAO now publishes a full set of audited financial statements and improvements have
been made to move financial reporting closer to International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS). Furthermore, an internal audit charter has been put in place, mechanisms for
improving risk management and risk prevention have been established and follow-up on
internal and external audit recommendations has been strengthened.
The 2005 assessment identified a number of areas where further steps would help solidify the
progress made. The status report on the implementation of safeguards assessment
recommendations, received from the BCEAO in March 2007, and 2005 audited financial
statements, indicate some progress, achieved by the Bank, in improving the external audit
process (including adopting a multi year audit program), applying IFRS, expanding
disclosures in the notes to financial statements on financial positions with the Fund by

4
countries, including Guinea-Bissau, and further strengthening of the effectiveness of the
internal audit function.

Guinea Bissau accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 with effect from
January 1, 1997. It joined the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU)
in 1997, and has no separate legal tender. The exchange system common to all members of
the union is free from multiple currency practices and exchange restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions. Since January 1, 1999, the CFA
franc has been pegged to the Euro at a fixed rate of € l=CFAF 655.95. On April 30, 2007, the
rate of the CFA franc in terms of the SDR was CFAF 733.8=SDR 1. Effective
January 1, 2007, the exchange arrangement of the WAEMU countries has been reclassified
to the category of conventional pegged arrangement from the category of exchange
arrangement with no separate legal tender. The new classification is based on the behavior of
the common currency, whereas the previous classification was based on the lack of a separate
legal tender. The new classification thus reflects only a definitional change, and is not based
on a judgment that there has been a substantive change in the exchange regime or other
policies of the currency union or its members.
XI.

Article IV Consultation

Guinea-Bissau is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV
consultation discussions with Guinea-Bissau were held in Bissau March 16–30, 2006. The
staff report was discussed by the Executive Board on July 31, 2006. Selected Issues and
Statistical Appendix (IMF Country report No. 06/313) was also circulated to the Board.

Guinea-Bissau: Relations with the World Bank Group
As of February 28, 2010
1.
As of February 28, 2010, IDA had approved altogether 29 credits and grants for
Guinea-Bissau for a total value of commitments of US$347.9 million equivalent. The most
important sectors were the following: Transport/Infrastructure/ Energy (seven operations,
total commitments: US$ 108.8million), Structural Adjustment/Development Policy
Operations (budget support, three operations approved in 1987-2000, and two since 2008, of
which one exclusively for the payment of primary teachers’ salaries; total commitments:
US$81.4 million) and Social Sectors, including Health and Education (eight operations and
US$ 67.2 million of total commitments). Two operations were implemented to support
private sector development (overall commitment: US$ 41million), and three to provide
technical assistance for economic management (overall commitment: US$ 22.9 million).
Projects supporting extractive industries and agriculture/natural resources management
benefited from 2 operations, each, with over commitments of US$ 19.9 million and US$ 6.7
million, respectively.
Budget Support Operations
2.
IDA discontinued budget support operations in the early 2000s, in the context of
political instability. Starting in 2008, however, the Bank initiated new budget support
operations to Guinea-Bissau, first with an emergency economic rehabilitation operation
approved in 2008 that provided funds exclusively for the payment of primary teachers’
salaries, and then with the first of a series of two programmatic Development Policy Grants
(US$8 million) approved in June 2009 and disbursed in early September. The second grant in
this series (US$6 million) is under preparation for approval in mid-2010.
Lending program
3.
In June 2009, the Bank approved an Interim Strategy Note for Guinea-Bissau for
2009-2011, based on two pillars: (i) Strengthening Economic Management and Laying the
Foundations for Improvement in the Productive Sectors; and (ii) Increased Access to Basic
Services. Capacity Development for efficient governance and project implementation is a
cross-cutting topic.
The currently active IDA Portfolio is composed of three operations with a total
4.
commitment of US$23 million, including a Coastal and Biodiversity Management Project
(CBMP, US$3 million), a Multi-Sector Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (US$15 million),
and a Rural Community-Driven Development Project. As of February 28, 2010, the IDA
undisbursed balance was US$13.7 million.
5.
In addition to the available country IDA allocation, the Bank has mobilized, in FY0910, about US$10 million from both the Bank and EU under the Food Price Crisis Response Trust

11
Fund to support the agricultural sector and for school feeding/food-for-work programs in
collaboration with WFP. Further, the IDA Community-Driven Development operation is
complemented by a similar Participatory Rural Development operation of US$5 million, funded
from the State and Peace Building (SPF) Trust Fund window for fragile states. The SPF also
provides funding for Technical Assistance on Economic Management to the Ministry of Finance,
complementing the IDA budget support, and an operation to support the implementation of the
National Health Development Plan. Further complementary (co-) funding is provided by the
Global Environment Facility (GEF) to the CBMP. An important multi-donor Education sector
operation is currently under preparation for delivery in 2010 to be submitted to the Education for
All-Fast-Track Initiative (EFA-FTI) for funding.
6.
IDA continues to provide interim assistance to the country as part of the Initiative for
the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC). On January 29, 2008, the IDA Board approved
the extension of HIPC interim debt relief up to 50 percent (in NPV terms) of total IDA debt relief
expected to be granted to Guinea-Bissau under the HIPC initiative. The extended interim debt
relief is expected to have freed up about $7 million in government resources annually.

Non-lending Program
7.
In FY09, the Bank completed an Education Country Status Report (in preparation of
the EFA/FTI funding proposal), and an Investment Climate Assessment. A Diagnostic Trade
Integration Study was disseminated in FY10; further a Dept Management Performance
Assessment carried out in September 2009; and finally, a Public Expenditure Management
and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR), drawing in part on a EU-funded PEFA
diagnostic and covering public financial management and procurement performance as well
as a review of public expenditure in education, was finalized in December 2009 (a
dissemination workshop was held on February 22-25).
8.
The World Bank Institute (WBI) recently started activities in Guinea-Bissau with a
workshop on sustaining natural capital. It is envisaged that WBI will launch more activities
in the coming fiscal year, through inputs and capacity development activities in areas such as
leadership and governance (demand-side governance), and possibly by contributing to the
establishment of a Global Development Learning Center in Bissau.
IFC and MIGA:

9.

IFC: As of February 28, 2010, IFC has no committed portfolio in Guinea-Bissau.

10.
MIGA’s portfolio in Guinea-Bissau consists of two projects, sponsored by Senegalese
and Malian investors. The investments, in support of the country’s infrastructure
(telecommunications) and tourism sectors, have a combined gross exposure of $24.1 million.
MIGA is currently working with British and French investors to provide coverage of three
projects in the infrastructure (water) and tourism sectors.

12
Guinea-Bissau: Relations with the African Development Bank Group
As of March 1, 2010
1.
As of March 1st, 2010, AfDB had approved 35 operations for Guinea-Bissau,
excluding multinational projects. This includes twenty six projects, four studies and 5
institutional supports representing a net commitment of 197.3 Unit of Account (UA). 32% of
these operations have been in the social sector, 21% in the transport and infrastructure sectors
and 15% in multisector. A total of UA 145.6 million representing 77.7% have been
disbursed. As of March 2010, the active portfolio comprises six ongoing projects
representing a total net amount of UA 44.48 million and a disbursed amount of UA 15.6
million.
Structural adjustment credits
2.
AfDB has approved a total of UA 13 million for structural adjustment operations.
These include two structural adjustment credits (SACs), one supplementary SAC, and one
economic rehabilitation and recovery credit (ERRC). The SACs supported the government's
program in the areas of economic liberalization and reform of the public administration and
public enterprise sectors and the ERRC supports peace building following the political
unrest, promotes the revival of the economy and encourages the pursuit of reforms.
Lending Program
3.
During January2008-March 2010, AfDB approved an interim HIPC debt release (US
dollar 17.48 million, a Fragile State Facility grant (UA2 million), a fish sector support grant
(UA2 million), a health sector grant (UA6 million), an emergency support grant to cholera
(UA0.33 million), a capacity building grant to public administration (UA7.86 million) and an
emergency budget support to budgetary reforms (UA5.7 scheduled for March 24, 2010.
Nonlending Program
4.
The Bank prepared a portfolio review in 2008 and a mid-term review of the Country
Strategy Paper in 2009. The Bank also participated in a Public Expenditure Management and
Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR) in 2009 in collaboration with the World Bank
and the European Commission.

Guinea Bissau—Statistical Issues
As of March 1, 2010
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance.
Data compilation has been impaired during the 1998–99 civil conflict. The authorities have
improved their data compilation in the recent years, with technical assistance from
international and regional institutions. The country participates in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) since November 2001. However, metadata for all data
categories and plans for improvement need to be updated.
National Accounts: Guinea-Bissau made progress on national account statistics in 2009.
INEC will publish in the second quarter of 2010 revised national account data for 2003–08,
based on the SNA93. The new data have a broader coverage of all sectors of the economy,
and as a result the GDP level has doubled. The new data covers GDP in both constant and
current prices, and GDP deflators. The government plans soon to start producing national
account statistics based on SNA08, with technical assistance from international and regional
institutions.
Price statistics: Since July 2002, a harmonized CPI has been compiled, based on the same
structure as in other WAEMU countries. Price data are collected only for the capital Bissau.
Government finance statistics: Government finance statistics missions contributed to: (1)
training on the methodology for Guinean officials, (2) implementation of a budgetary data
collection program, and (3) setting up a source database and a worksheet Table of State
Financial Operations (TOFE). Since 2007, the monthly TOFE is compiled on a regular basis
and used as a basic tool in monitoring the program with the IMF. A GFS expert from West
AFRITAC is scheduled to visit Bissau during the 2nd quarter of 2010 to provide technical
assistance to the authorities in compiling and disseminating GFS and implement an action
plan designed to improve GFS data dissemination to users.
Monetary statistics: Guinea-Bissau has adopted the BCEAO’s accounting and reporting
procedures for monetary and financial statistics. The BCEAO has responsibility for
compiling and reporting monetary data for Guinea-Bissau to STA. The accuracy of monetary
statistics is affected by large cross-border movements of currency among BCEAO member
countries and delays of up to two years in the recording of such movements can occur.

14
Balance of Payments Statistics: Guinea-Bissau reports trade data to AFR for operational
purposes, using information from customs. It reports balance of payments (BOP) and
international investment position statistics to STA on an annual basis, albeit with
considerable delays. BOP data are weak, mostly due to substantial unregistered trade and
inconsistencies between data on net foreign assets as reported by the BCEAO and other
economic indicators. In April 2008, an STA TA mission assessed the methodology and
compilation procedures for the production of BOP statistics and provided training to BCEAO
staff. The mission found that the large number of small-scale operators, a large informal
sector, and institutional weaknesses (only some 20 percent of businesses file tax returns)
hamper the data collection.
While no external debt data are published by the Ministry of Finance, stock and flow data are
regularly produced and transmitted to the BCEAO. The outstanding stock of debt comprises
only about 200 active loans.
II. Data Standards and Quality
The country participates in the GDDS since
November 2001.

No data ROSC is available.

III. Reporting to STA
There is currently no monthly, quarterly or annual government finance data submitted for
reporting in the International Financial Statistics (IFS) or the Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook. Monthly data on monetary statistics for Guinea Bissau are reported on a regular
basis for publication in IFS, albeit with some delays.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Guinea-Bissau
May 4, 2010
This statement provides an update of recent developments in Guinea-Bissau.
1.
On April 1, soldiers briefly detained the Prime Minister and arrested the Chief of the
Armed Forces. In light of these events and the uncertainties they created, Management
decided to postpone consideration of the authorities’ request for an ECF-supported program,
which the Executive Board was to discuss on April 2, 2010, pending clarification of the
situation.
2.
A staff team visited Bissau during April 15-18, 2010, to review the status of the
economic reform program and consult with representatives of the international community,
including key donors. In its meetings with the President, the Prime Minister, and the
Minister of Finance, the authorities emphasized that the military incident was being resolved
and had not affected the civilian government. They also reported that all government
ministries and institutions as well as the Parliament were operating normally. The
authorities reiterated their commitment to the reform program and renewed their request for
support from the IMF under the ECF. The Prime Minister also sent a letter to the Managing
Director stressing political stability and the importance of the ECF program for
Guinea-Bissau.
3.
Economic performance was satisfactory under the EPCA in 2009 and continued to
be good in the first quarter of 2010. Except for the indicative target on social spending, for
which data are not yet available, all quantitative targets for end-March were met. Fiscal
revenues were 6 percent higher than programmed, and with expenditures well-contained, the
target for domestic budget financing was met with a margin. Despite the delay in program
approval, the authorities are moving ahead with structural reforms and have already made
good progress against benchmarks established for mid-2010: the treasury committee became
operational on March 22; norms to tighten the simplified spending procedure were approved
by the Minister of Finance on April 22; and the Council of Ministers approved the legal
framework for the one-stop shop to streamline the licensing of new businesses.
4.
The staff’s discussions with key donors in mid-April indicated that their
commitments for both budget support and project financing remained in line with program
assumptions. The AfDB approved on March 24 an operation of US$8.7 million, as envisaged
under the program, with plans to disburse shortly after the ECF request is presented to the
IMF Board. The World Bank fielded an overlapping mission to Bissau in April to finalize a
budget support operation which is expected to be considered for approval by the end of May.
We received indications in late April that the EU considered Guinea-Bissau eligible for
support under the V-Flex in 2010. The authorities reiterated their commitment to take all
necessary steps should a shortfall in financing materialize. Staff will discuss contingency
measures in more detail during the next staff visit to Bissau in June.

Press Release No. 10/185
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 7, 2010

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431, USA

IMF Executive Board Approves US$33.3 Million Arrangement Under the Extended
Credit Facility and Additional US$1.5 Million in Interim HIPC Assistance for
Guinea-Bissau
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a three-year
Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement in an amount equivalent SDR 22.365 million
(US$33.3 million) to support Guinea Bissau’s medium-term economic program. The
Executive Board also approved the second tranche of interim assistance under the Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative of SDR 1.016 million (US$1.5 million).
The authorities’ economic program aims at helping the country move towards fiscal and debt
sustainability, as well as achieving stronger economic growth and poverty alleviation. The
program focuses on reinforcing public finances, modernizing public administration, and
raising the quality of public services. It also seeks to promote job creation by removing
impediments to private sector development and enhancing the provision of financial
services. Satisfactory performance could pave the way for Guinea-Bissau to benefit from
debt relief by the end of the year through the enhanced HIPC and Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiatives (MDRI).
Following the Executive Board's discussion on Guinea Bissau, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, issued the following statement:
“Despite difficult external and domestic circumstances, economic growth has been resilient
in Guinea-Bissau and macroeconomic performance has improved in recent years. The
authorities achieved most targets of their 2009 economic program, and implemented
important structural reforms. The Fund supported these efforts through a disbursement under
the Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance.
“To build on these achievements and provide the basis for stronger economic growth and
poverty alleviation, the government has defined a medium-term macroeconomic and
structural reform program for 2010–2012. This program aims at raising economic growth,
keeping low inflation, reducing the fiscal deficit, and gradually narrowing the external

2

current account imbalance. Political stability, effective governance, and strong commitment
to reform are essential to the success of the program and the full engagement of donors.
“The 2010 budget is an important first step in the medium-term macroeconomic program that
would help move Guinea-Bissau toward sustainable fiscal and external positions. In order to
achieve that objective, the budget introduces strong revenue measures, reallocates
expenditure in favor of priority areas, including social spending, and addresses more
decisively the accumulation of domestic arrears.
“The government’s program of economic reforms appropriately emphasizes enhancing
public financial management, strengthening fiscal controls, broadening the tax base,
modernizing tax administration, and raising the quality of public services. It also seeks to
remove impediments to private sector development, improve the provision of financial
services, step up access to social services, and alleviate poverty.
“Satisfactory performance on the medium-term economic program will help pave the way for
Guinea-Bissau to reach the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative completion
point in late 2010. Debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), together with additional debt relief from bilateral
creditors, will significantly alleviate the debt burden and help Guinea-Bissau advance toward
external and fiscal sustainability,” added Mr. Portugal.

3

ANNEX
Recent Economic Developments
In 2009 Guinea-Bissau made progress stabilizing its economy. Economic growth was
resilient; inflation slowed; and budgetary stability was regained:


Guinea Bissau was affected by the impact of the global financial crisis in 2009. Lower
prices for cashews—the predominant export—and falling remittances exacerbated fiscal
and balance of payments pressures. Still, thanks to a favorable cashew harvest and a pickup in construction, real GDP growth is estimated to have reached 3 percent.



Fiscal performance was satisfactory. Tax revenues exceeded previsions by about 2
percentage points of GDP, reflecting the good cashew harvest and stepped-up collection
efforts. At year-end donor support exceeded programmed levels. Meanwhile, the
government contained spending and kept domestic arrears within target.



The external current account deficit (excluding grants) widened to 6½ percent of GDP.
The higher deficit reflects a combination of lower cashew prices, a surge in imports of oil
and construction material, and a decline in remittances. It was largely financed by an
increase in grants, so the overall external balance deteriorated only moderately.



Lower food and fuel prices slowed inflation, and domestic inflationary pressures
remained subdued due to the CFAF peg to the euro.

Program Summary
The government’s medium-term macroeconomic program supported by the ECF aims to
raise economic growth and reduce poverty. The program is designed to reinforce public
finances, modernize public administration, and raise the quality of public services. The
program also focuses on removing impediments to private sector development; improving
access to social services, agriculture policy, and poverty reduction and achieving external
sector sustainability.
The macroeconomic objectives of the government program are to:


Raise real GDP growth to 4½ percent by program end;



Contain inflation below 3 percent per year, in line with WAEMU targets;



Keep the primary budget deficit below 4 percent of GDP annually through 2012;



Gradually narrow the external current account deficit (excluding official transfers).

To achieve these objectives, the government program sets out the following policy priorities:
 Strengthen public finances, in PFM and other areas, with a view to containing the fiscal
deficit and supporting macro stability;


Normalize the government’s relations with domestic banks and the private sector by
addressing the large stock of domestic arrears;

4



Modernize the public administration to create space for priority spending and raise the
quality of public services through a medium-term civil service reform and security sector
reform program;



Promote good governance and increasing and transparency.



Promote job creation by removing impediments to private sector development and
strengthen the provision of financial services;



Improve access to social services and step up efforts to alleviate poverty via government
investments in infrastructure for power, roads, and the port;

Move toward debt sustainability, particularly by helping the country achieve the HIPC/MDRI
completion point.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 11, 2010

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Guinea-Bissau
On May 7, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Guinea-Bissau. 1
Background
Recent favorable developments are creating an opportunity for Guinea-Bissau to confront the
challenges of the last decade. There are signs of political stability as reflected by
a representative civilian government and the peaceful presidential election that took place last
year. Public institutions and technical capacity improved, thanks to extensive assistance from
development partners. In 2009, performance under the program supported by the IMF
Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance (EPCA) was favorable, creating the conditions for GuineaBissau to move toward a medium-term program of economic reforms that promotes growth and
alleviates poverty.
In 2009, Guinea-Bissau made progress stabilizing its economy. Economic growth was resilient
despite lower prices for cashews--Guinea-Bissau’s main export, and falling remittances.
A favorable cashew harvest and a pick-up in construction helped sustain real GDP growth at
about 3 percent. Lower food and fuel prices slowed inflation, and domestic inflationary
pressures were subdued supported by the CFA peg to the euro.
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.
1

2
Fiscal performance has been satisfactory despite last year’s external and political challenges.
Tax revenues overperformed by about 2 percentage points of GDP, reflecting the good cashew
harvest and stepped-up collection efforts. The government contained spending to compensate
for delays in donor support, which came at the end of the year, and held domestic arrears within
target.
The external current account deficit (excluding grants) widened to 6½ percent of GDP but was
largely financed by an increase in grants, so the overall external balance deteriorated only
modestly. The higher deficit reflects a combination of lower cashew prices, a surge in imports of
oil and construction material, and a decline in remittances.
Growth is projected to accelerate to 3½ percent in 2010 and to 4−5 percent over the medium
term. The modest recovery is expected to be driven by the projected rebound in the global
economy and its positive impact on the terms of trade and cashew prices; spillovers from the
global recovery through higher remittances; the positive impact of a more settled political and
security environment on the business climate; sustained cashew production; expanded and
diversified agriculture; and continued large donor-funded public investment projects. The
external current account deficit (excluding grants) is projected to narrow gradually over the
medium term to about 5 percent of GDP, as cashew prices and export volumes trend upward
and remittances rise. Inflation is expected to be held to the West African Economic and
Monetary Union (WAEMU) convergence norm, below 3 percent of GDP, as the effects of
commodity price changes wane and the CFA peg to the euro has a stabilizing effect.
Executive Board Assessment
Despite difficult external and domestic circumstances, economic growth has been resilient in
Guinea-Bissau and macroeconomic performance has improved in recent years. Directors
commended the authorities for the implementation of their 2009 economic program, supported
by the Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance provided by the Fund, and welcomed the mediumterm program of economic reforms aimed at accelerating growth and reducing poverty. To help
ensure the successful implementation of the program and the full engagement of donors,
Directors stressed the importance of political stability, effective governance, and strong
commitment to reform.
Directors observed that prudent fiscal policy will be essential to achieve the overall objectives of
the program. An important step will be the rigorous implementation of the government’s 2010
budget, which introduces strong revenue measures and keeps expenditure within available
resources, while protecting priority spending.
Directors considered appropriate the authorities’ focus on structural reforms aimed at
strengthening public finances. Improvements in public financial management are top priority to
strengthen fiscal controls and ensure proper budget implementation. Tax administration reform
will broaden the tax base and increase revenue collection, while civil service reform will help
modernize public administration and raise the quality of public services. Directors were also

3
encouraged by the authorities’ plans to improve access to social services and step up efforts to
alleviate poverty.
Directors agreed that preventing the accumulation of domestic government arrears is critical to
improve liquidity conditions and help foster private sector development. They welcomed the
authorities’ plans to clear arrears in the medium term, and encouraged them to adopt liquidity
management practices that take into account the evolution of revenue and external financial
assistance. Directors also noted the authorities’ efforts to remove barriers to investment,
overcome the impediments to adequate credit access, and strengthen the Anti-Money
Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework.
Directors noted that the exchange rate peg has served Guinea-Bissau well, providing a solid
anchor for macroeconomic stability and that standard methods do not indicate any significant
misalignment of the exchange rate. They stressed, however, that structural reforms are
necessary to improve competitiveness and spur stronger growth.
Directors observed that the delivery of debt relief under the enhanced Highly Indebted Poor
Countries’ (HIPC) and the Multilateral Debt Relief (MDRI) initiatives, together with additional
relief from bilateral creditors, will significantly alleviate the debt burden and help Guinea-Bissau
move toward external and fiscal sustainability. Directors noted that the successful
implementation of the authorities’ economic program would help pave the way for GuineaBissau to reach the HIPC completion point in late 2010.

Statement by Laurean W. Rutayisire, Executive Director for Guinea-Bissau
March 30, 2010
1.
Today’s Article IV Consultation with Guinea-Bissau and Board consideration of the
authorities’ request for an arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) provide us with
the opportunity to convey to the Board, Management and the staff our authorities’ appreciation of
the productive relations they continue to maintain with the Fund. The authorities value the advice
and technical assistance provided by the institution in support of their continued efforts to
maintain macroeconomic stability and make headway towards poverty reduction.
2.
After years of a fragile political and economic situation, Guinea-Bissau is now enjoying a
new era of political and macroeconomic stability, thereby allowing its authorities to embed their
ambitious policy and reform agenda into a medium-term framework. Critical for the successful
implementation of this agenda will be not only the authorities’ unfailing commitment to the
program objectives, but also sustained technical and financial assistance from the country’s
partners in general and the Fund in particular. Reinvigorated by political backing of highest level
country officials, the authorities are on their part strongly determined to implement sound
macroeconomic and structural policies with the view to achieving HIPC and MDRI completion
during the course of this year and securing fiscal and debt sustainability afterwards.
Program Performance under the 2009 EPCA-supported Program
3.
Staff rightly notes that performance under the 2009 EPCA-supported program was broadly
satisfactory. On the quantitative front, most targets were met. In particular, the steps taken by the
authorities to strengthen tax administration contributed to pushing revenues significantly above
targeted program levels. At the same time, the authorities continued to abide by their firmly-held
principle of keeping public expenditures within available resources, thus exerting a strict control
over public spending. In addition, prudent debt management helped them avoid contracting
nonconcessional external debt or accumulating new domestic arrears at end-December 2009.
However, the ceiling on repayment of previous years’ arrears was breached, as the authorities took
steps to significantly reduce the stock of domestic arrears, namely the 2008 wage arrears.
Nonregularized expenditures exceeded the program ceiling in the run-up to the mid-year elections
but were since accounted for in the budget. Going forward, the authorities are determined to take
necessary steps to limit recourse to simplified spending procedures.
4.
On the structural front, a number of measures have been implemented consistent with the
authorities’ commitments to reform civil service, enhance business environment, and strengthen
public financial management. In particular, these include the biometric census of civil servants, the
enactment of a new Investment Code, and the Cabinet approval of an action plan for public
financial management

2

Policy and Reform Agenda for 2010 Onwards
5.
While reflecting the authorities’ strong commitment to program objectives, the satisfactory
performance under the 2009 EPCA also augurs a strong performance under the requested
ECF-supported program. This bodes well for Guinea-Bissau economy in view of the authorities’
ambitious policy and reform agenda.
Fiscal and Public Financial Management Reforms
6.
The authorities will pursue the fiscal reform efforts that have served the country well by
helping overshoot substantially revenue targets in 2009. On top of the improved revenue
collection procedures which have been instrumental in explaining this overperformance,
revenue-enhancing measures will include a comprehensive review of existing customs
exemptions, and improved customs administration, notably through the introduction of the
ASYCUDA automated system in main customs posts (Bissau, airport and Safim). Revenue
mobilization will also benefit from the recent elimination of suspensions of customs duty on
certain products such as rice, wheat, sugar, cement, and other construction materials.
7.
In view of the strong reliance of revenue performance on customs operations, the heavy
focus of fiscal reform measures on improving customs administration is appropriate. However,
stronger revenue performance is also expected to stem from the strengthening of tax
administration, notably through the broadening of the tax base and capacity building at the large
taxpayer unit. In support of the authorities’ efforts to strengthen tax and customs administration,
we are hopeful that the Fund will continue to play a key role through the provision of technical
assistance. It is thus our expectation that the recent authorities’ request for technical assistance in
this area will be promptly and favorably considered.
8.
On the expenditure side, public spending will continue to be constrained by available
resources. At the same time, increasing room will be made for social spending in line with the
country’s poverty reduction strategy. In this connection, it is the authorities’ intention to allocate
at least 50 percent of tax revenues to current and domestically financed capital expenditures in
education, health, agriculture, and infrastructure.
9.
Building on the action plan that was recently approved by the Cabinet, PFM reforms will
be pursued with the aim at improving budget planning, execution and monitoring. More
specifically, a medium-term expenditure plan consistent with the poverty reduction strategy will
be in the making during the course of this year. Moreover, steps will be taken to finalize the
installation of the financial management system notably by making operational the Treasury
accounting system and facilitating information-sharing between the tax and customs
administrations. With World Bank assistance, an action plan for the reform of public procurement
was put in place in a number of key ministries while work is underway to implement it in some
other ministries.

3

Civil Service, Defense and Security Sector Reforms
10.
Reforms of the civil service, defense and security sectors constitute a cornerstone of the
authorities’ reform agenda. Satisfactory implementation of these reforms will help the country
make decisive steps towards securing fiscal sustainability and social and political stability. It
hinges however on the availability of necessary financing which the authorities are currently
working to mobilize in close coordination with the country’s development partners.
11.
The civil service reform materializes the authorities’ determination to improve the
efficiency of public administration in view of the large size of the public sector relative to the
population of Guinea-Bissau. If fully implemented, the reform is expected to result in a significant
downsizing of the public sector notably by ensuring separation of staff above the mandatory
retirement age, addressing overstaffing, and facilitating the mobility of “redundant” civil servants
to the private sector. In parallel, steps are being taken by the authorities to exercise stricter controls
over the civil service payroll and to ensure that “ghost” workers are eliminated from the payroll
database. The outcome of this ongoing exercise will be reflected by the planned publication of the
verified data of the biometric census of public sector employees. It is expected that these data will
help update later this year the database of the finance ministry. Other civil service reform
measures envisaged by the authorities in the context of the ECF-supported program include the
gradual use of a computerized and unified payroll and personnel management system in the
Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Labor and Public Services and then in most other
ministries.
12.
The authorities attach a high premium on the reform of the defense and security sector.
This reform would entail a significant reduction in the military personnel and rationalization of
security forces. Given the significant fraction of the wage bill claimed by the sector, progress on
this front will have a welcome positive impact on the prospects for fiscal sustainability. However,
as previously noted, such progress will be contingent on the success of ongoing efforts to mobilize
necessary financing with the assistance of the country’s partners. It is noteworthy that steps
already taken to improve expenditure management include the implementation of the action plan
for public procurement reform in a number of ministries, of which the Ministry of Defense.
13.
Other aspects of the authorities’ reform agenda encompass the development of the private
and financial sectors. In this connection, measures to improve business environment, such as the
planned Cabinet approval of a legal framework for the “one-stop” shop which will help streamline
licensing and registration costs and procedures faced by new businesses. With regard to the
financial sector, a key focus will be placed on overcoming impediments to adequate credit access
and strengthening the AML/CFT framework.
Debt Sustainability
14.
Prospects for achieving debt sustainability will be facilitated by the implementation of the
authorities’ medium-term plan for domestic arrears clearance. Execution of the plan has already
begun with the clearance of costly and verified arrears to the BCEAO and commercial banks

4

which was made possible by the SDR allocation and donor assistance. As part of the plan, the
authorities plan to settle pre-1999 arrears to the private sector and to finalize the audit of 2000-07
arrears to the private sector. Resource permitting settlement of these arrears will begin this year.
Going forward, public debt management will be improved notably through capacity building at the
debt management unit and systematic use of the debt management system (SYGADE).
15.
The authorities have demonstrated a strong commitment to meet the requirements for
achieving the HIPC completion point. In particular, their efforts to make progress toward HIPC
completion triggers have translated into a satisfactory implementation of the 2009
EPCA-supported program, improved public expenditure management and procurement system,
notable achievements in social sectors, and steps to regularize Guinea-Bissau’s relations with
external multilateral and bilateral creditors. In this light, the authorities request the second tranche
of interim HIPC assistance to cover PRGF repayment obligations falling due in 2010.
Conclusion
16.
Amid difficult domestic and external circumstances, our authorities made significant
strides in advancing their policy and reform agenda set in the context of the 2009 EPCA-supported
program. This positive outcome reflects the authorities’ strong ownership of program objectives
and attachment to sound program implementation. However, the authorities are fully aware that
more efforts still need to be made on a sustained basis to overcome the significant obstacles facing
the country in its quest for fiscal and debt sustainability, strong growth, and poverty reduction.
While their determination to make such efforts is unquestionable, Fund involvement in the context
of the ECF will be critical to securing steady progress toward these objectives.
17.
In light of Guinea-Bissau’s strong program performance, we call on Directors to consider
favorably the authorities’ request for a three-year arrangement under the ECF.
