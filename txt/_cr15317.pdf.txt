IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Nepal

On November 16, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Nepal.
The earthquakes in April and May and protests and trade disruptions following the promulgation
of a new constitution in September have exacerbated the macroeconomic policy challenges
facing the Nepalese economy. Real GDP growth is estimated to have decelerated to 3.4 percent
in 2014/15 (mid-July 2014 to mid-July 2015) from 5.5 percent in 2013/14. Inflation had been
moderating from a high base but the recent acceleration to 6.9 percent in August (y/y) widens the
wedge over Indian CPI, thereby undermining Nepal’s competitiveness given the exchange rate
peg to the Indian rupee. The financing data indicates that the budget was in surplus for the third
year in a row, even as revenues fell short of the budget for the first time in several years. As a
result, public debt remained on a declining path, falling to 26 percent of GDP in 2014/15, from
32 percent of GDP in 2012/13. The external current account surplus reached 5.0 percent of GDP
in 2014/15, aided by a surge in remittances following the earthquake and lower oil import prices.
Reserves rose to US$7.2 billion, or 33 percent of GDP, covering almost eight months of
prospective imports.
Growth is expected to gradually rebound to around 5.5 percent by 2016/17, as economic activity
recovers from the earthquake and reconstruction gains momentum. Inflation is projected to rise
to about 8.5 percent over the next 12 months as losses in agricultural production and damage to
transport systems represent a large shock to the supply of agricultural products. However, over
time, inflation pressures should decline as supply bottlenecks ease. Stepped-up foreign aid and
higher inflows of remittances will further boost liquidity pressures in the financial system,
necessitating active liquidity management to avoid excess inflation relative to India. The
medium-term outlook depends importantly on the authorities’ reform efforts. Experiences in
other fragile countries show that natural disasters can have permanent effects on potential

growth, thus highlighting the need for ambitious macroeconomic and structural policies. This
underscores the importance of a decisive boost to public capital spending and reforms to
strengthen the business climate.
Recent developments have heightened the downside risks to the staff’s baseline scenario.
Continued political instability and a continuation of the recent disruptions to economic activity
and transportation and trade routes to and from the country’s southern border and the related fuel
crisis could severely affect growth and inflation in this fiscal year. Another important downside
risk relates to the government’s capacity to boost capital spending owing in part to the delay in
setting up the National Reconstruction Authority (NRA).

Executive Board Assessment2
While macroeconomic management has been broadly satisfactory, Executive Directors noted
that Nepal’s macroeconomic performance has been held back by the earthquakes and the recent
unrest and disruptions to transportation and trade routes. While growth is expected to gradually
rebound as reconstruction gains momentum, the outlook is subject to downside risks.
Directors called for policy action to boost capital spending, maintain macroeconomic stability,
and lift potential growth.
Directors emphasized that fiscal policy needs to support post-earthquake reconstruction spending
and medium-term growth through higher public investment. Swiftly operationalizing the
National Reconstruction Authority and strengthening the government’s capital budget
implementation capacity by establishing proper and transparent planning, selection, and
implementation for major capital projects remain priorities. Directors agreed that continued
improvements in revenue performance and anchoring fiscal policy by a ceiling on net domestic
financing of the budget would help to maintain a strong fiscal position. They noted that
concessional external financing can finance the bulk of a sustained increase in capital spending
needed to address infrastructure gaps.
Directors concurred that the peg to the Indian rupee continues to serve as a transparent anchor
and that monetary policy should be geared toward supporting the peg. While a temporary
increase in inflation as a result of the recent supply shocks should be accommodated, Directors
recommended that, as conditions normalize, monetary policy be reoriented to keeping Nepalese
inflation close to that in India. Strengthening the central bank’s liquidity management capacity
will be important in this regard.
Directors called for intensified efforts to safeguard the financial sector’s stability and resilience.
They looked forward to the implementation of the high-priority FSAP recommendations,

Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

including a further strengthening of bank supervision and the development of a bank resolution
framework. Noting that financial sector risks may have been amplified by the earthquakes and
the recent disruption to economic activity, they welcomed the authorities’ intention to conduct a
diagnostic of these events’ impact on banks and insurance companies. Directors also encouraged
the authorities to enhance the quality of the central bank’s external audit and legal framework to
further support its autonomy and governance.
Directors stressed the importance of unlocking the country’s hydropower generation potential
and sustained reforms to improve the investment climate to help achieve Nepal’s goal of
becoming a middle-income country by 2030. They also recommended that state-owned
enterprises in the energy sector be put on a sound financial footing to reduce losses and
contingent liabilities.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to collaborate closely with the Fund, including
on capacity development. They welcomed the authorities’ interest in discussing a longer-term
engagement, possibly through the Extended Credit Facility, which could support macroeconomic
and structural reforms to accelerate the post-earthquake recovery and foster sustainable and
inclusive growth.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context: Nepal has been trapped in a low-investment, low-growth equilibrium. The
authorities’ aim is to graduate from least-developed country status within 7 years.
Macroeconomic situation and outlook: The earthquakes in April and May have held
back growth. Together with the recent unrest and disruptions to trade routes, they also
pushed up inflation. Growth is expected to gradually rebound as economic activity
recovers and reconstruction gains momentum. High remittance inflows are supporting a
strong external position, as well as high broad money growth. The outlook is subject to
considerable downside risk, involving continued political and economic instability and
slower-than-expected growth of government capital spending.
Medium-term prospects: While remittances are expected to continue to support the
external position, the outlook for growth depends importantly on the authorities’
reform efforts. Experience in other fragile states shows that natural disasters can have
permanent effects on potential growth. This underscores the importance of a decisive
boost to public capital spending and reforms to strengthen the business climate.
Key policy recommendations: Fiscal policy needs to support post-earthquake
reconstruction and medium-term growth through higher public investment. Stronger
public financial management (PFM) will be key to the swift and efficient implementation
of higher capital spending. Along with efforts to improve the business climate, this
should support private investment needed to generate sustained higher economic
growth and employment opportunities. The exchange rate peg to the Indian rupee
provides a useful nominal anchor to the economy, and the real exchange rate is broadly
in line with fundamentals. Money growth should be contained to a level consistent with
supporting the peg. The monetary operations framework needs to be strengthened to
put the central bank in a position to better control the growth of broad money in the
face of strong inflows of remittances and aid. Financial sector reforms should continue
to focus on bolstering regulation and supervision, and improving financial
infrastructure, to reduce risk and increase access to finance.

INTRODUCTION
1.
Nepal has been trapped in a low-investment, low-growth equilibrium and remains
Asia’s poorest country, despite progress with poverty reduction:
 After a decade-long civil war and the subsequent abolition of the monarchy in 2008, the
country has been undergoing a gradual transition to a federal democratic state.
Macroeconomic management has been broadly satisfactory. However, partly because of
successive governments’ preoccupation with internal power rivalries, infrastructure
investment has been inadequate and the business climate unsupportive of growth. Due to
lack of opportunities at home, Nepalis have been moving abroad in large numbers, mostly
to Persian Gulf countries and Malaysia.
Poverty has been declining, from over 50 percent of the population in 2003/04 to just under
25 percent in 2010/11, thanks in part to rising remittances, which currently amount to about
29 percent of GDP. Nevertheless, output per capita remains the lowest in the region, and
further efforts are needed to improve human development indicators (Table 9).

2.
Nepal was hit by two massive earthquakes, in April and May. Over 8,800 lives were lost
and damages and losses are estimated at US$7 billion or nearly one third of GDP. In the context of a
June 25 international donor conference, multilateral and bilateral donors pledged more than US$4
billion worth of grants and concessional loans to be disbursed over five years. The Nepalese
authorities requested the equivalent of SDR35.65 million (50 percent of quota) under the Fund’s
Rapid Credit Facility. The funds were disbursed as direct budget support.
3.
The September 20 promulgation of the constitution triggered unrest, a fuel crisis, and
a change in government. After the earthquakes, the main political parties settled on a federal
model of parliamentary government with seven provinces. However, fearing that the proposed
provincial boundaries will perpetuate their political marginalization, ethnic groups in the south of
the country mounted protests. The resulting disruptions to economic activity and transportation and
trade routes to and from the southern border caused shortages of fuel and other imported goods.
Parliament voted out the Prime Minister. His party moved to the opposition and a new Prime
Minister and Cabinet were inaugurated in mid-October.

The earthquakes exacerbated the macroeconomic policy challenge of boosting growth
by raising public capital spending and private investment, while containing inflation:




Real GDP growth is estimated to have decelerated to 3.4 percent in 2014/15, compared to a
pre-earthquake baseline forecast of 5 percent. Growth had accelerated to 5.5 percent in
2013/14 owing largely to a favorable monsoon. Average growth of 4 percent in the three
previous years lagged neighboring countries.
Inflation had been moderating from a high base, in line with developments in India.
However, the recent acceleration, to 6.9 percent in August (y/y), widens the wedge over
Indian CPI, thereby undermining Nepal’s competitiveness.
Preliminary data on government spending suggests a 28 percent increase in capital
spending in 2014/15. However, the financing data indicates that the budget was in surplus
for the third year in a row, even as revenues fell short of the budget for the first time in
several years. As a result, public debt remained on a declining path, falling to 26 percent of
GDP in 2014/15, from 32 percent of GDP in 2012/13.
The external position has remained strong. The current account surplus reached 5.0 percent
of GDP in 2014/15, aided by a surge in remittances following the earthquake and lower oil
import prices. Reserves rose to US$7.2 billion, or 33 percent of GDP, covering almost eight
months of prospective imports.
The effect of the earthquakes on the financial system has yet to become clear. As of July
2015, commercial and development banks had capital adequacy ratios comfortably in excess
of the required minima (6 percent) and reported low non-performing loans (Table 8).

5.
Growth is expected to gradually rebound to around 5½ percent by 2016/17, as
economic activity recovers from the earthquake and reconstruction gains momentum. Inflation
is projected to rise to about 8½ percent over the next 12 months. Losses in agricultural production
and damage to transport systems represent a large shock to the supply of agricultural products,
which account for some 40 percent of the CPI basket. However, over time, as agricultural production
recovers and transportation infrastructure improves, inflation pressure should ease. Stepped-up
foreign aid and higher inflows of remittances will further boost liquidity pressures in the financial
system, necessitating active liquidity management to avoid excess inflation relative to India.
6.
The medium-term outlook depends importantly on the authorities’ reform efforts.
Experience in other fragile countries shows that natural disasters can have permanent effects on
potential growth. For instance, the June 2015 IMF policy paper on IMF Engagement with Countries in
Post-Conflict and Fragile Situations—Stocktaking notes that fragile states tend to experience larger
growth downturns in the face of shocks. This highlights the need for ambitious macroeconomic and
structural policies. To illustrate this and the importance of ramping up public infrastructure spending
and attracting FDI-financed mega-projects to boost medium-term growth, staff prepared two
scenarios (see Table 1):


The baseline scenario is an updated version of the medium-term scenario presented in the
context of Nepal’s request for a disbursement under the RCF. In this scenario, following the

initial reconstruction-related, partially donor-funded rebound in activity, growth decelerates
to around 4 percent over the medium term (Tables 3–7). Continued under-implementation
of the budget and under-investment hold back imports thereby supporting reserves. A debt
sustainability analysis conducted on the basis of this scenario in the RCF staff report (IMF
Country Report 15/224) concluded that Nepal’s risk of debt distress would remain low.


The reform scenario illustrates the implications of adopting staff’s policy advice. These
reforms would aim to sustain the growth momentum, with an acceleration to about 6
percent by 2019/20, on sustained efforts to strengthen the government’s capital budget
implementation capacity, while bringing inflation down to the neighborhood of that in India.
A persistent push to develop large FDI-financed hydropower projects would lay the basis for
stronger, sustained, private-sector led growth in the next decade. Construction on the large
hydropower projects is projected to start in 2017/18. Insofar as these projects are highly
import intensive, and FDI and donor financing do not completely cover higher import
spending, the current account balance would turn to modest deficits in the medium term
due to higher imports and reserves would be lower than in the baseline. External debt would
remain manageable and continue to be contracted largely on highly concessional terms.

7.
Recent developments have heightened the downside risks to the baseline scenario
(Table 2). Continued political instability and a continuation of the recent disruptions to economic
activity and transportation and trade routes to and from the country’s southern border and the
related fuel crisis could severely affect growth and inflation in this fiscal year. Another important
downside risk relates to the government’s capacity to boost capital spending. The baseline scenario
assumes a considerable degree of under-execution of the ambitious 2015/16 budget. Nevertheless,
owing also to delays in setting up the National Reconstruction Authority (NRA) which remain to be
resolved, the 40 percent increase in expenditure relative to the 2014/15 budget outturn that is
projected in the baseline scenario, and expected to persist through 2015/16, may not be achieved.
Other downside risks pertain to remittances, and the financial sector.

Authorities’ Views
8.
The authorities were more optimistic on the outlook for growth. The unrest and
disturbances to trade routes were deemed to be temporary phenomena. Once stability would
return, there would be confidence effects from the new constitution. The authorities were also
hopeful that the measures taken to streamline procedures for government spending would pay off.
Together with progress in operationalizing the NRA this was expected to underlie an important pick
up in government capital and reconstruction spending following the October/November festival
season. In conjunction with base effects from low growth in 2014/15, this was expected to raise
growth above 5 percent in 2015/16.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Nepal’s long-term vision is to graduate from least-developed country status by 2022 and to achieve
middle income country status by 2030. Accordingly, key objectives of Nepal’s 13th Development Plan
(2013-16) are to achieve an annual growth rate of 6 percent and bring down the percentage of the
population living below the poverty line to 18 percent by 2016. These objectives are echoed in the
Budget for 2015/16 (mid-July 2015/mid-July 2016) and Monetary Policy for 2015/16. Experience in
other low-income countries has shown that the recovery and reconstruction after a natural disaster
such as the recent earthquakes takes considerable time. In light of this, discussions focused on the
macroeconomic policy mix needed to support Nepal’s recovery while maintaining macroeconomic and
financial stability.

A. Fiscal Policy

Public Debt in Nepal and other LICs
(In percent of GDP)

9.
Fiscal policy was tighter than planned in recent
years due to budget implementation bottlenecks.
Spending under-implementation left the large
infrastructure gap mostly unaddressed. In conjunction with
relatively strong revenue collection, it kept the public debt
to GDP ratio on a declining path, unlike in other lowincome countries.

10.
Going forward, fiscal policy needs to support post-earthquake reconstruction and
medium-term growth through higher public investment. This should be financed through a
combination of higher tax revenues (see ¶14), external grants and loans, and domestic financing.
11.
The 2015/16 budget targets a large increase in spending. Compared to the estimated
outturns for 2014/15, it aims for a 44 percent increase in current spending and a 168 percent
increase in capital spending. In the IMF’s presentation of the fiscal data, the 2015/16 budget targets
an overall fiscal deficit—measured by the net incurrence of liabilities—of 4.9 percent of GDP,
compared to a surplus of 0.3 percent of GDP in 2014/15. If implemented, this fiscal impulse would
have important implications for the conduct of monetary policy.
12.
It is unlikely that the budget can be implemented in full. The Budget Speech labeled
2015/16 as the “Year of Implementation”. While this is welcome, persistent implementation
challenges and delays in operationalizing the NRA will make full budget implementation highly
unlikely. For the next fiscal year, staff recommends that the budget targets a substantial but realistic
spending increase. Reforms recommended to strengthen budget implementation are discussed in
¶16.
13.
Fiscal policy should be anchored by a ceiling on net domestic financing of the budget
(NDF). Concessional external financing can finance the bulk of the projected increase in
8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NEPAL

infrastructure spending. On this basis, and taking into account the exchange rate peg and the need
to protect international reserves as well as the need to ensure adequate space for continued growth
in private sector credit, NDF should not exceed 1 percent of GDP per annum. High-quality capital
spending financed by concessional donor inflows should be accommodated since it keeps debt in
check while allowing for the needed infrastructure push. Given staff’s projections for concessional
foreign financing, this will translate to an overall fiscal deficit of 3¾ percent of GDP per annum in
the short term, and 2½ percent of GDP per annum in the medium term (reform scenario in the text
table). In case of capital spending shortfalls, the deficit should be reduced one for one with shortfalls
in donor-financed spending (with a corresponding reduction in NDF and a rise in NFA for any donor
financing received but not spent). As discussed below, this fiscal performance would need to be
underpinned by decisive structural fiscal reforms.
14.
Continued improvements in revenue performance will be important to maintain a
strong fiscal position and meet the increasing need for capital expenditure. Revenue has been
growing in recent years, albeit at a decreasing rate, on the back of rising consumption and imports.
However, revenue fell short of the FY2014/15 budget and the ambitious target set for this year
implies a strong possibility of another shortfall in the current fiscal year. To ensure that the tax
revenue to GDP ratio remains on a rising trend, staff recommended the following:
 The Inland Revenue Department (IRD) needs to ensure that taxpayer compliance is not
adversely affected by the earthquake and the current unrest in the country.
 Staff welcomed the recently completed review of the tax policy framework and the intent to
commence with the implementation of various policy reforms from FY2015/16. Staff
encouraged the authorities to work closely with FAD in the drafting of a unified tax code.
 The findings and recommendations of a VAT-GAP analysis, conducted by a recent FAD
mission, should be used for an action plan to improve tax administration and compliance.
15.
Stronger public financial management (PFM) will be key to the swift and efficient
implementation of post-earthquake reconstruction as well as the “regular” capital budget.
Budget execution in Nepal suffers from persistent problems related to structural weaknesses such as
poor project management and bureaucratic hindrances. The earthquake has added urgency to the
need to improve capital budget execution and the authorities recently announced steps to expedite
expenditure and simplify approval processes. 1
16.
Capital budget implementation remained slow in the first two months of the fiscal
year. A coordinated effort by the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the National Planning Commission
(NPC), and key line ministries to address bottlenecks is needed. Staff welcomed the MOF’s ongoing
efforts to draft a Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM). This could provide
important guidance to the budget implementation process and should be put in place in time for
1
For spending items included in the approved budget, government bodies are no longer required to obtain
authorization from the District Development Committee, the line ministry and the NPC, a process that could take up
to six months. Similarly, multi-year projects included in the approved budget in one year no longer need to be reauthorized at the start of each fiscal year. Projects with minimal implementation will henceforth need to surrender
budget resources. And a revised employee performance evaluation system will incentivize project completion.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

the start of the next fiscal year. Staff welcomed the preparation of the PFM Reform Action Plan
(following the publication of the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Assessment
in May) and encouraged the authorities to focus the Plan on key priorities for each agency and
implement it as soon as possible. Finally, staff reiterated past FAD PFM technical assistance advice to
enhance upstream project preparation, appraisal and selection, including: (i) establishing proper and
transparent planning, selection and implementation for major capital projects; and (ii) developing
better targeted selection and prioritization criteria based on cost-benefit analyses, project life cycle
and future recurrent costs, project implementation readiness, as well as associated risks (see also
Box 3 in the staff report for Nepal’s request for disbursement under the RCF).
17.
Debt management needs to be strengthened in view of the increasingly complex debt
instruments and larger borrowing envisaged in the future, particularly related to the
development of Nepal’s hydropower potential. The joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability
Analysis conducted in the context of Nepal’s request for disbursement under the RCF concluded
that Nepal’s risk of debt distress remains low. However, a Debt Management Performance
Assessment (DeMPA) conducted by the World Bank in August 2014 called for improving the
effectiveness of managerial oversight on the debt management functions. It also recommended to
task one entity with the preparation of a comprehensive debt management strategy, analyze the
costs and risks of the debt portfolio, and make debt service forecasts more robust.
18.
Protecting priority social spending and improving the effectiveness of safety nets are
important. The growth of spending on health and education has stagnated in the last few years.
Staff encouraged the authorities to reverse this trend and noted that the macro framework in the
reform scenario can accommodate an increase in current spending by almost 2 percent of GDP per
annum. Once earthquake-related spending is phased out, a rising share of this increase should be
allocated to social spending.
19.
Large state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in the energy sector need to be put on a sound
financial footing. This is needed to reduce contingent liabilities and encourage private and foreign
energy sector investment. In recent years, the combined losses of the Nepal Electricity Authority
(NEA) and Nepal Oil Corporation (NOC) averaged about 1½ percent of GDP per year. To prevent
future accumulation of losses, the automatic bi-weekly oil price adjustment mechanism introduced
in 2014 should be adhered to and electricity tariffs should be reviewed more regularly. The NEA’s
operations should be scrutinized more closely and remaining losses should be covered by
transparent budget transfers.

Authorities’ Views
20.
The authorities were confident that capital budget implementation would pick up
from mid-November, after the festival season, and would end higher relative to the last fiscal year
in part due to the simplification of administrative procedures. Nevertheless, they acknowledged
scope to improve implementation capacity and that while there had been improvements in
procurement, more needed to be done, including to strengthen capacity of the public and private
10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NEPAL

construction sectors. The authorities viewed the 1 percent of GDP ceiling on NDF as too restrictive in
view also of the abundance of liquidity in the financial system.
21.
The authorities pointed out that social spending had been rising steadily in absolute
terms and that much of the reconstruction spending would be on schools and health facilities.
Moreover, local governments also carry out social spending but tracking this is difficult. On retail
fuel prices, the authorities noted the importance of broadly maintaining parity with prices across the
border to prevent distortions.

the staff’s view, the authorities’ focus should be on
competitiveness-enhancing structural reforms to support the peg. Stepped-up efforts to install
enough hydropower capacity to eliminate load shedding could give a big boost to the investment
climate.

monetary management. Staff also welcomed the introduction of deposit auctions in August 2014.
Over the past year, deposit auctions have at times contributed to the mopping up of excess liquidity.
The next step would be to hold regular pre-announced deposit auctions with a view to effectively
mop up excess liquidity and systematically raising short-term interest rates from current low levels,
closing the gap with interbank interest rates in India. This should be supported by the NRB refining
its liquidity forecasting framework building on suggestions made in the context of the FSAP and
earlier MCM technical assistance missions. A key recommendation has been for the NRB to adopt an
interest rate corridor to provide more systematic guidance to short-term interest rates with a view to
strengthening the monetary transmission mechanism. In addition, treasury sterilization bonds could
be introduced for the purpose of addressing structural excess liquidity with NRB instruments
(repo/reverse repo) used for fine-tuning. The introduction of treasury sterilization bonds would also
foster capital market development and make the cost of monetary tightening transparent in the
budget. Consideration should also be given to phase out the NRB’s directed lending facilities as they
complicate the conduct of monetary policy and are not core central bank functions; they should be
gradually transferred to the budget.

Authorities’ Views
25.
The authorities favored a looser monetary policy stance to promote growth. They
broadly concurred with the staff’s exchange rate assessment. By virtue of the peg to the Indian
rupee, India’s gains in disinflation were expected to spill over to lower inflation in Nepal. Broad
money should expand by at least 15 percent to support growth. In view of market imperfections, the
NRB’s directed lending facilities are needed to achieve the government’s inclusive growth objectives.
They expected interest rates to rise once government spending would pick up. To regulate liquidity,
the authorities were also looking at monetary operations frameworks other than the interest rate
corridor. They questioned the relevance of treasury sterilization bonds in the context of a separation
of public debt management and monetary management.

C. Financial Sector Reforms
26.
Steps have been taken to begin to address weaknesses in the legal and supervisory
framework governing financial institutions highlighted by the 2014 FSAP. The 2014 FSAP stress
tests suggest banking system strains if asset quality deteriorates moderately. The attached matrix
(Appendix I) summarizes the limited progress made so far in implementing high-priority FSAP
recommendations. Staff recommended follow through on existing policy initiatives along with
additional reforms to support the stability and resilience of the financial sector:

12



Strengthen the taskforces set up to follow up on the FSAP recommendations. Staff
welcomed the various taskforces in the NRB and the GON established to follow up on FSAP
recommendations. Given the large number of recommendations as well as the need for
collaboration across institutions, an apex committee may be useful. That committee should
be provided a mandate, technical support, suitable resources and a firm timetable.



Continue to strengthen the bank supervision function. The NRB is working to complete
the first cycle of risk-based supervision (RBS) on-site inspections. Off-site supervision needs

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NEPAL

significant strengthening to complement the on-site component. As the supervisory
information system (SIS) is put in place, plans to integrate the off-site and on-site functions
should be developed. A program to hire, train and retain supervisory staff should be
developed to provide for continuity in supervisory activities. In this regard, staff urges the
NRB to revisit the staff rotation policy, which has undermined its ability to effectively
supervise the financial system.


Limit further forbearance. Staff welcomed the NRB’s statement that post-earthquake
forbearance on asset classification and loan loss provisioning would remain limited in scope
and time-bound.



Extend legal upgrades to secondary legislation. While the primary legislation (BAFIA, NRB
Act Amendments, Deposit and Credit Guarantee Fund Act) has benefitted from considerable
TA and is pending enactment, the secondary legislation and regulations require attention.
The NRB is encouraged to identify the priorities in the prudential regulations that need
upgrading and begin the upgrade process.



The NRB Risk Management guideline should be converted to a directive, officially
introducing risk management requirements to the banking industry. The directive’s
issuance will help level the playing field by officially informing the industry of the shift to
risk-based supervision. Additionally, guidance should be provided as the industry transitions
to IFRS.



Use the results of the Special Inspections Program to prepare a diagnostic of the
impact of the earthquakes on the banks. This diagnostic could be based on the results of
the ongoing special inspection of 54 BFIs (representing 64 percent of the banking system) by
DFID, in coordination with the World Bank and the Fund, and by performing additional
diagnostics of financial institutions to determine their resilience. On this basis, a strategy
should be developed to resolve unviable BFIs and address possible capital shortfalls in
others.



Develop an operational framework for bank resolution. Building on the relevant laws
that have been submitted to Parliament, the next step in the development of an operational
framework for bank resolution is to draw up implementing regulations.

Formalize a system to monitor banks’ capital-raising plans. The two-year phase in period
to increase the paid up capital demands diligent NRB oversight. A formal review process
should be established to ensure that each BFI has internalized the obligation to increase the
capital and adheres to the capital plan. Also included in this process should be a robust
review of the accounting techniques used by BFIs, to minimize the potential for overstated
earnings. And the NRB should establish a contingency plan that would include corrective
action and administrative sanctions in the event of failure to meet required capital levels.
27.
Efforts to strengthen the Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of
Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework should continue. Staff welcomed the enactment of the


INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

NEPAL

AML/CFT ordinances and Nepal’s exit from FATF’s enhanced scrutiny in June 2014. The
implementation of the AML/CFT regime should be further strengthened, including through the
issuance of implementing rules and the application of risk-based supervisory tools, supported by
ongoing IMF TA.
28.
The ongoing safeguards assessment of the NRB will call for a strengthening of the
quality of the NRB’s external audit and legal framework. A safeguards assessment mission in
September 2015 found that limited progress has been made in following up on recommendations
made in the context of a similar evaluation in 2011. Notable positive developments include the
successful implementation of a new accounting system and improved financial reporting practices.
However, several key functions lag behind and strong commitment from the NRB Board and senior
management will be needed to modernize them; in particular internal audit and currency and vault
operations. Priority should be given to the following:


The quality of the external audit should be brought in compliance with international
standards. The NRB should engage an auditor with requisite global experience and expertise
in the audit of large financial institutions.



The NRB's legal framework should be enhanced to further support central bank autonomy
and governance.

Authorities’ Views
29.
The authorities broadly agreed with the recommendations and requested technical
assistance and training to support implementation. The Special Inspections Program would be
completed by October and the NRB had asked DFID to go ahead with the preparation of the “fast
diagnostic” of the impact of the earthquake on banks and insurance companies. The NRB would
consider the modalities for monitoring banks’ implementation of their capital plans. It would aim to
issue the Risk Management directive by February 2016.

D. Enabling Sustainable and Inclusive Growth
30.
Efforts to improve the business climate should be intensified. There is considerable
scope to simplify trading across borders, enforcing contracts, paying taxes and getting credit. Staff
welcomed the steps taken to extend the one-stop-shop to facilitate registration of new companies
beyond large investors, to any investor. As a next step, the one-stop-shop should be further
improved for instance by strengthening the investment facilitation coordination committee. In
addition, labor market reforms including streamlining the complex labor code, streamlining
procedures (e.g. environmental impact assessments) and strengthening policy frameworks to boost
private-sector-led investment are critical.
31.
Unlocking Nepal’s hydropower generation potential would relieve power shortages
and enable the exports of power to help diversify foreign exchange earnings (Box 2). In this
14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NEPAL

regard, staff welcomed the Power Trade Agreement signed with India and the Project Development
Agreements signed for the development of two large hydropower projects with foreign investors.
Large hydropower projects are complex and take long to develop. In view also of earlier failed
attempts to develop Nepal’s hydropower potential, staff encouraged the authorities to consider
setting up a special high-qualified project committee that could help to establish realistic project
timetables to spearhead progress in developing the large hydroelectric power projects in the
pipeline.

KEY OBJECTIVES OF A POSSIBLE ECF ARRANGEMENT
32.
A possible ECF arrangement would focus on supporting the government’s efforts to
recover from the earthquakes. The authorities first expressed interest in longer-term Fund
engagement in the context of the discussions on their request for a disbursement under the RCF.
Program discussions could take place later this year, depending on the new government’s interest.
The arrangement’s aim would be to boost public and private investment, social spending and
financial inclusion, and address financial system weaknesses, with a view to improving growth
prospects and poverty reduction efforts, and all while preserving overall macroeconomic stability.
Accordingly, the program would focus on strengthening policies in four key areas: (i) public capital
budget management; (ii) monetary policy operations; (iii) financial sector reforms; and (iv) the
business climate. In transition to a higher growth trajectory, the government’s medium-term reform
efforts will create additional external financing needs, over and above those created by the
earthquake-related reconstruction effort. Access to IMF financial resources—which like in the RCF
would be disbursed to the MOF’s account at the NRB—would depend on program strength, as a
more robust reform agenda over the near- to medium term would come with a greater BOP and
fiscal financing need—currently suppressed by budget under-execution and under-investment.

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
Macroeconomic performance has been held back by the earthquakes and the ongoing
political instability. Growth has been dampened by the disruption caused by the natural disaster
and the recent unrest and the under implementation of the budget. The supply shocks related to
the earthquake and trade disruption have caused Nepal’s inflation to rise, exacerbating its
decoupling from the declining path of inflation in India. Meanwhile, remittances have continued to
support consumption, poverty reduction, and high international reserves.
34.
Growth is expected to gradually rebound as reconstruction gains momentum but
inflation is projected to rise over the next 12 months. Losses in agricultural production and
damage to transport systems along with the recent disruption to trade routes represent a large
shock to the supply of agricultural products and other goods. However, over time, as agricultural
production recovers and transportation infrastructure improves, inflation pressure should ease.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

NEPAL

35.
The medium-term outlook depends importantly on the authorities’ reform efforts.
Experience in other fragile countries shows that natural disasters can have permanent effects on
potential growth, thus highlighting the need for ambitious macroeconomic and structural policies. In
a “reform scenario,” the growth momentum from post-earthquake reconstruction would be
sustained through determined efforts to strengthen the government’s capital budget
implementation capacity and a persistent push to develop large FDI-financed hydropower projects.
Given that hydropower projects are highly import intensive, the current account balance would turn
to modest deficits in the medium term due to higher imports and reserves would be lower than in
the baseline. External debt would remain manageable and continue to be contracted largely on
highly concessional terms.
36.
Recent developments have heightened the downside risks to the baseline scenario.
Continued political instability and disruptions to trade to and from the southern border could
severely affect growth and inflation in this fiscal year. Another important downside risk relates to the
government’s capacity to boost capital spending. Owing also to the delay in setting up the National
Reconstruction Authority (NRA), the increase in expenditure may be more limited than expected.
37.
Fiscal policy needs to support post-earthquake reconstruction spending and mediumterm growth through higher public investment. Establishing proper and transparent planning,
selection, and implementation for major capital projects remains a priority. Continued improvements
in revenue performance will be important to maintain a strong fiscal position. Concessional external
financing can finance the bulk of the sustained increase in government capital spending needed to
address infrastructure gaps. On this basis, and taking into account the exchange rate peg and the
need to protect international reserves as well as the need to ensure adequate space for continued
growth in private sector credit, fiscal policy should be anchored by a ceiling on net domestic
financing of the budget (NDF).
38.
Monetary policy should be geared toward supporting the exchange rate peg,
containing inflation, and safeguarding reserves. As the economy recovers, the central bank
would need to closely monitor price developments. In light of the exchange rate peg, monetary
policy would need to be oriented to keep Nepalese inflation close to that in India. Higher inflows of
foreign aid and remittances will further boost liquidity pressures in the financial system,
necessitating active liquidity management.
39.
Efforts to enhance the stability and resilience of the financial sector should be
intensified. In particular, implementation of the high-priority FSAP recommendations should be
accelerated. Financial sector risks may have been amplified by the earthquakes, thus underscoring
the importance of conducting a diagnostic of their impact on the banks, continuing to strengthen
the bank supervision function, and developing an operational framework for bank resolution. The
two-year phase in period to increase banks’ paid up capital requires diligent NRB oversight. The
quality of the NRB’s external audit should be brought in compliance with international standards
and its legal framework should be enhanced to further support central bank autonomy and
governance.

The peg to the Indian rupee continues to serve as a transparent anchor and the level of
the exchange rate remains broadly in line with fundamentals. To the extent that remittances
skew domestic activity to non-tradables and contribute to reducing the competitiveness of
agriculture and industry, the authorities’ focus should be on competitiveness-enhancing structural
reforms. Stepped-up efforts to install enough hydropower capacity to eliminate load shedding could
give a big boost to the investment climate and inclusive growth.

It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation takes place on the standard 12month cycle.

DOMESTC RISKS
Post-earthquake reconstruction is slow
Under-execution of the ambitious 2015/16 budget and
delays in reconstruction work in the aftermath of the
earthquake, could depress confidence and hold back private
investment and growth.

Political instability
Political instability, even in the aftermath of the
promulgation of the constitution, could undermine
confidence and delay economic reforms.
Financial sector distress
The damages and economic disruption caused by the
earthquake could exacerbate existing weaknesses in the loan
portfolio of banks and financial institutions.

Natural disaster
Natural disasters similar to the recent earthquake could take
a significant toll on Nepal, including by damaging
infrastructure, housing and the production base.

EXTERNAL RISKS
Persistently low energy prices
A slowdown in countries hosting Nepali migrant workers
(Persian Gulf countries, Malaysia) could weaken remittance
inflows. This would reduce demand and growth; tighten
liquidity and expose weaknesses in the financial system; and
reduce government revenues due to slower import growth.
Slower-than-projected growth in India
Prolonged slow growth in India could reduce FDI and, to
some extent, exports and remittances.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shwos events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff).
The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent,
“medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks
and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Box 1. Nepal – Exchange Rate Assessment
Nepal stands out through the large remittances it receives and their effect on the economy. At almost
30 percent of GDP in 2014, Nepal’s remittances are its most important source of foreign exchange,
amounting to 2½ times exports of goods and services and over ⅔ of imports. The bulk of remittances come
from migrant workers in Persian Gulf countries and Malaysia. In recent years, the outflow of workers from
Nepal has outpaced that of Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and the Philippines—larger countries with
migrant workers heading to similar destinations as Nepal. The number of registered migrant workers leaving
Nepal hit a record high of almost 600,000 in 2014—very large relative to its population of about 28 million.
Correspondingly, the growth of remittances has averaged 15 percent since 2009/10.

Exports of Goods and Services

Nepal’s export performance has been weak, lagging
that of peers. The exports of goods and services to GDP
ratio declined from 16 percent in the early 2000s to 11½
percent in 2014/15. In the garment’s sector, for example,
Nepal’s market share in exports to the US has halved
since 2005, and its share in the EU market has also
declined. Weak exports along with the remittancesfueled increase in imports have caused the trade deficit
as a share of output to increase steadily over the years,
reaching 31 percent of GDP in 2013/14.

Box 1. Nepal – Exchange Rate Assessment (Concluded)
Gross international reserves (including the central bank’s holdings of Indian rupees) reached US$7.2
billion at the end of 2014/15, equal to 7.9 months of prospective imports. Reserves have risen on the
strength of remittances and notwithstanding lackluster export performance. As laid out in the recent RCF
staff report, Nepal’s reserves should be maintained at about 7 months of imports of goods and services not
related to FDI-financed projects, in view of the peg to the Indian rupee, the need to be able to absorb
external shocks and the low opportunity cost of holding reserves.
The application of several econometric approaches1 suggests that the exchange rate is broadly in line
with macro-economic fundamentals. Last year’s Article IV consultation concluded that the exchange
rate was broadly in line with fundamentals. Reflecting also the inflation differential with India, Nepal’s
REER appreciated by about 8 percent over the past year. Nevertheless, and in part because Nepal’s large
trade deficits are sustained by even larger remittances, various econometric approaches to assess the
exchange rate produce a relatively wide range of estimates:
i) The current account panel regression approach takes fundamentals, policy variables, and cyclical factors
into account in estimating the current account “norm”.2 The current account norm for Nepal is estimated at
1.8 percent of GDP, while the underlying current account in 2014/15 is 5.0 percent of GDP. Assuming an
elasticity of the trade balance with respect to the REER of -0.33, the difference between the two suggests an
undervaluation of the REER 9.7 percent.
10
Nepal's Current Account and Trade Deficit

ii) The index equilibrium exchange rate approach
compares the current value of the REER with an
estimate of its medium-term equilibrium value. The
gap between the two indicates that the REER is
approximately 23 percent overvalued as of end-June
2015.

iii) The external sustainability approach determines

Trade balance/GDP
CA/GDP
that the current account that is consistent with
‐35
stabilizing Nepal’s net international investment
position (IIP) at the 2013 level of 9.8 percent of GDP is estimated at -0.4 of GDP. Taken together with the
current account projected in the medium term (-1.1 percent of GDP), this suggests the REER is overvalued by
2.1 percent.
__________________
These are based on the EBA methodology. See “The External Balance Assessment (EBA) Methodology, IMF
2013, IMF WP/13/272.

The current account norm is based on a reduced form panel regression of the current account on policy
variables, non-policy fundamentals, and cyclical factors. The difference between the current account norm
and the actual underlying current account is then combined with an elasticity of the trade balance to the
REER to arrive at an estimate of the REER that is consistent with fundamentals and desirable policies.

Box 2. Nepal—Developing the Hydropower Potential
Nepal’s per capita use of electricity is among the lowest in the world. The inadequate electricity supply results
in persistent load shedding, representing a major constraint to growth. Developing the country’s vast
hydropower potential should be a top priority to boost growth and diversify foreign exchange earnings.
At present, less than one percent of Nepal’s vast hydropower potential is being exploited. Nepal’s
commercially viable hydropower generation potential is estimated at 43,000 MW. Earlier attempts to
develop this vast potential on a large scale have failed.
Over the past year some promising steps were made, notwithstanding the earthquake-related damage to
the Upper Tamakoshi project which pushed back its date of completion to late-2017:




Nepal signed a power trade agreement with India in September 2014.
Project development agreements were signed for two large projects (Upper Karnali (900MW) and
Arun-3 (900MW)).
Nepal’s Investment Board cleared a proposal by a Chinese investor to develop the West Seti
(750MW) project.
The capacity of government agencies involved in the regulation and development of the
hydropower sector is being strengthened through technical assistance from various development
partners (e.g. the World Bank, Japan, and the United States).

Progress to date

Financial Stability
1.

Refocus monetary policy operations on domestic
liquidity management to reduce excess reserves, and
especially their volatility, with appropriate burden
sharing of costs between the financial system and the
budget. Introduce Treasury sterilization bonds.

NRB

ST

In process
The NRB has been holding deposit auctions
intermittently since August 2014 to reduce banks’
excess liquidity. The introduction of Treasury
sterilization bonds is under discussion

2.

Undertake a thorough Asset Quality Review (AQR) to
identify the extent of problem loans in banks’ balance
sheets (with TA support).

NRB

ST

Not done
Lack of AQR is largely offset by the special
investigations conducted by KPMG (Portugal) in
conjunction with NRB supervisors. Reviews conducted
in BFIs holding about 64% of total assets.

3.

Conduct an in-depth review and financial analysis of
loan portfolios during bank examinations.

NRB

ST/MT

In process
Loan portfolio reviews are performed on-site; the
reviews are guided by the outmoded asset
classification and loss provisioning guidance. As the
supervisors gain experience, it is expected the reviews
will be more in-depth.

4.

Reinforce efforts to address financial infrastructure
shortcomings in the Payments System, clearing, credit
information, collateral registry, and debt recovery
areas.

NRB/MOF

ST/MT

In process
NRB established a payment and settlement system
department, which will also oversee some of the new
products such as mobile banking and branchless
banking.
Reforms have been identified to strengthen the credit
information bureau, the collateral registry and debt
recovery areas but action has not yet been taken.

Financial Sector Oversight
A. Banking Sector
5.

6.

Redefine supervisory approach by:
・ integrating risk-based off-site and on-site
supervision;
・ increasing analytical capacity through training;
・ introducing supervisory management information
systems (MIS);
・ developing a dedicated human resources (HR)
rotation policy; and
・ streamlining the NRB board participation in
operational decisions.

Ensure effective compliance with supervisory directives
and guidelines by:
・ performing a thorough follow up of the
implementation of supervisory recommendations;
・ proactive, earlier, and stronger corrective actions.

NRB

NRB

ST/MT

MT

In process / not done
Supported by FIRST-funded TA (FIRST) risk-based
supervision (RBS) is being implemented for Class A
institutions; and is in preliminary stage for on-site
supervision. A complementary off-site RBS component
is yet to be developed. A donor is assisting in
procurement of MIS, and FIRST aims to support off-site
RBS practices. A critical need remains for a dedicated
HR policy to hire, train and retain qualified supervisors.
No action taken on streamlining the NRB Board’s
participation in operational decisions.
Not done
Corrective and supervisory actions remain largely
informal; with PCA having a formal framework. The
FIRST project supports the development of programs
to ensure compliance.

8.

Review licensing regulations and policy to strengthen
the licensing process and support a consolidation of
the sector. Once completed, re-license all Classes A, B,
and C banks that meet the new reinforced
requirements, with an appropriate phase-in period,
into a single-license category.
Granting the NRB explicit consolidated supervision
powers, amending the legal framework to incorporate
a comprehensive definition of related parties and
controlling interests.

Under review
NRB has indicated its intent to review the licensing
framework; this is supported by the FIRST project. The
consolidation of the sector may – in the long run have
an impact on the various classes of FI.
Not done
Although amended BAFIA and NRB Acts have been
submitted to Parliament, it is uncertain if the listed
items were addressed.* Introduction of consolidated
supervision will be sequenced as appropriate.

B. Non-banking Sector
9.

10.

11.

Divide the CIT into two separate legal entities,
segregating the capital market business, to be placed
under the supervision of the Securities Board of Nepal
(SEBON), from the pension fund business.
Place the EPF and CIT pension fund business under the
joint supervision of the Insurance Board (IB) and NRB.
Strengthen the operational independence of the IB
and SEBON.

In preparation
MOF is preparing a concept report (based on a study
trip to India)

Crisis Management
12.

Revise Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) policy to
require stronger supervisory action, including
designation of problematic status at an earlier stage of
capital depletion.

Under consideration
NRB considering including liquidity as a trigger for
PCA program. No changes made regarding the
designation of problematic status.

Not done
A high-level interagency coordination committee
meets on an ad hoc basis. It would be important to
formalize the mandate of this committee to include
the development of a national crisis contingency plan.

A simulation has not yet been conducted; the
authorities are encouraged to conduct crisis
simulations after passage of the relevant Acts.

In progress. A Line Ministry Budget Information System (LIMBS)
has been rolled out
Revenue has been growing but fell short of the 2014/15 budget
Implemented. An automatic bi-weekly oil price adjustment
mechanism was introduced in 2014. Since the NOC did not fully
pass through the decline in international oil prices to its
customers, it made a profit in 2014/15 and was able to repay part
of its debts
In progress. MOF has drafted a Fiscal Responsibility and Budget
Management Act

Enhance cash management, and improve revenue and expenditure

Exchange Rate Arrangement
Nepal unified its exchange rate in February 1993. Since October 1997, the exchange arrangement of
Nepal has been reclassified as pegged to a single currency unit. The Nepalese rupee is pegged to
the Indian rupee at a rate of 1.6. Currently, all merchandise imports (except for a few goods
restricted for security or related reasons) are freely available through an open general license
system, with foreign exchange provided through the banking system at the market exchange rate.
As of October 16, 2015, the exchange rate of the Nepalese rupee (Nr) was US$1=Nrs. 103.79.
The restriction on quantitative limits on foreign exchange for leisure travel was removed in early
2011. The Industrial Enterprises Act places a 75 percent limit on the conversion and transfer to
foreign currency of salaries of non-residents from countries where convertible currency is in
circulation. Since the limit applies to amounts that may be less than net salaries, it gives rise to an
exchange restriction under Article VIII.
Safeguards Assessments
A safeguards assessment mission took place in September 2015 in the context of the RCF approved
by the Executive Board in July 2015. The mission found that limited progress has been made in
following up on recommendations made in the context of a similar evaluation in 2011. Notable
positive developments include the successful implementation of a new accounting system and
improved financial reporting practices. However, several functions lag behind and strong
commitment from the NRB Board and senior management will be needed to modernize them; in
particular internal audit and currency and vault operations. Two key priority areas were identified.
First, the quality of the external audit should be brought in compliance with international standards.
The NRB should engage an auditor with requisite global experience and expertise in the audit of
large financial institutions. Second, the NRB's legal framework should be enhanced to further
support central bank autonomy and governance.
2014 Article IV Consultation
The Executive Board discussed the staff report for the 2014 Article IV consultation (IMF Country
Report No. 12/ 326) on July 3, 2014. Consultations with Nepal are held on the standard 12 month
Article IV consultation cycle.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of July, 2015)

A. Partnership in Nepal's Development Strategy
Nepal has achieved remarkable progress. The country managed to halve the percentage of people living
on less than $1.25 a day in only seven years, from 53 percent in 2003/2004 to 25 percent in 2010/2011.
Several social indicators in education, health and gender have improved. In addition, growth averaged
4.5 percent per annum during 2006-2015; a percentage point higher than achieved during the conflict
period. With the September 2015 promulgation of the constitution, Nepal is posed to attain higher
growth with focus returning to development. The country’s vision of middle income status by 2030 is a
possibility, if available resources are put to productive use.
However, on April 25, a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck central Nepal. That earthquake and its
sequence of aftershocks caused 8,700 deaths and some 25,000 injuries. Estimates suggest that the
earthquakes could end up pushing an additional 2.5-3.5 percent Nepalese into poverty in 2015/16. This
translates to 700,000-982,000 additional poor, directly as a result of the earthquake. A Post-Disaster
Needs Assessment (PDNA), completed on June 15, placed total damages and losses to about US $7
billion and reconstruction needs to about US $6.7 billion. While development partners pledged $4.4
billion in aid during the June 2015 International Conference on Nepal’s Reconstruction, the actual
implementation of the reconstruction remains a challenge. The Government of Nepal through its budget
speech in July 2015 announced a reconstruction budget of NPR 91 billion (USD 900 million). However,
the modalities of the fungibility, usability and expenditure of the funds towards reconstruction in the 14
worst-affected districts remain unclear. Further clarity awaits the functioning of the National
Reconstruction Authority.
To start rebuilding, Nepal needs to take advantage of its economic potential and put in place the
prerequisites that will provide faster, sustained and inclusive growth. It has to use available resources to
productive use andto quickly make good losses from the earthquakes. Remarkably, Nepal’s economy
grew steadily even during the height of conflict and economic management remained prudent. This
hallmark of prudent economic management is at test more today with low capital investment that
resulted in consecutive years of budget surplus.
To move to a higher growth trajectory, Nepal will have to remove bottlenecks to private and public
investment in key growth sectors. The most vivid example of Nepal’s economic potential is hydropower.
While the estimated potential for hydroelectricity generation in Nepal is 84,000 MW, of which at least
half is economically viable, only 746 MW (less than 2 percent of the viable potential) is currently
developed. Hydropower development could be a game changer for Nepal. Development of the sector
would reduce load-shedding and provide major revenues through exporting electricity to India or even
China.
The World Bank Group (WBG) stands ready to support Nepal’s aspirations for increasing economic
growth through increased investments in key sectors while providing support to make growth more
inclusive and to help equalize opportunities across groups and communities. This constitutes a major
shift in World Bank Group (WBG) support away from short-term post-conflict assistance towards

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

NEPAL

establishing the foundations for increased and inclusive growth. After three consecutive interim
strategies in Fiscal Years (FY) 2007, 2009 and 2011, the WBG will provide more long-term support. A
new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) of WBG covers four years from FY2014-2018.

B. IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
Areas in which the Bank leads and there is no direct IMF involvement
The areas in which the Bank leads the policy dialogue and there is no direct IMF involvement are the
social sectors, infrastructure, environment, and agriculture.
In education, the Bank has been supporting GON across the entire terrain of the education sector
including school education—which also includes early childhood education and non-formal education,
higher education, and technical and vocational education and training (TVET). In the school sector, it has
supported Nepal’s efforts to enhance equitable access to and the quality of school education through a
series of projects and programs during the past two decades, including through the ongoing School
Sector Reform Program (SSRP). Using a Sector Wide Approach (SWAp), SSRP brings together GON and
13 development partners, of which 10 partners pool their resources with those of GON (Three
development partners support the program directly through parallel financing and two pooling partners
provide both pooled and non-pooled support). The Second Higher Reform Project, which follows the
recently closed Second Higher Education Project, supports reforms in selected institutions for improving
quality, relevance and efficiency of higher education, and also assists underprivileged students for
equitable access. The objective of the Enhanced Vocational Education and Training Project is to expand
the supply of skilled and employable labor by increasing access to quality training programs, and by
strengthening the TVET system in Nepal. Under its new CPS, the WBG will continue its ongoing
engagement in the education sector through a stronger focus on improving quality, enhancing equitable
access, and providing skills for jobs.
In health sector, the Bank has been working closely with the government and development partners in
supporting the government’s sector program since 2004 through a SWAp, similarly to its engagement in
the education sector. The Second HNP and HIV/AIDS Project is assisting the Government in improving
the equitable delivery of health care services, specifically by increasing access to essential health care
services and their utilization by the underserved and the poor. The Community Action for Nutrition
Project (Sunaula Hazar Din) aims to improve practices that contribute to reduced under-nutrition of
women of reproductive age and children under the age of two and to provide emergency nutrition and
sanitation response to vulnerable populations in Earthquake affected areas.
To support broad-based growth, the Bank supports investments in several key infrastructure sectors. The
Road Sector Development Project provides all-season road access in select hill districts. The Bridges
Improvement and Maintenance Program provides innovative financing by utilizing a new financing
instrument (Program-for-Results), which links disbursements of funds directly to the delivery of verifiable
results. It is the first Program-for-Results to be approved by the World Bank’s Board under IDA and
supports the vision behind Nepal’s Bridge Policy and Strategy of 2004 to provide “safe, reliable and cost
effective” bridges. Similarly Strengthening the National Rural Transport Project builds on from the

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NEPAL

Bank’s earlier work on rural connectivity to enhance the availability and reliability of transport
connectivity for rural communities. Connectivity features prominently in the World Bank’s current CPS.
The Bank is also strongly engaged in the energy sector where, however, progress continues to be slow.
The Kabeli Transmission Project aims (i) to support the addition of transmission capacity to the
Integrated Nepal Power System; and (ii) to provide access to electricity and cooking fuel to communities
in the area of the Kabeli 132 kV transmission line. Similarly Nepal-India Electricity Transmission and
Trade Project will support construction of 400 kV high voltage backbone transmission network including
receiving substation to evacuated electricity imported from India. The IDA-IFC financed Kabeli-A
Hydroelectric Project will add on grid generation capacity through public private investment in a
peaking run-of-river hydropower project with an installed capacity of 37.6 MW. It will also assist the
Investment Board of Nepal (IBN) in improving its ability to carry out its responsibilities of facilitating the
development of large hydropower projects across the country in line with applicable international
performance, technical, environmental and social standards. IDA is also funding installation of 25 MW
grid connected solar farm and planning and investment in loss reduction activities under the Grid Solar
and Energy Efficiency Project.
To support rural development, the Nepal Irrigation and Water Resources Management Project (IWRMP)
aims to improve irrigated agriculture productivity and management of selected irrigation schemes, and
enhance institutional capacity for integrated water resources management. IWRMP has enabled farmers
to increase crop production and cropping intensity through improvement in cropping pattern and
demand based extension services. The Modernization of Rani Jamara Kulariya Irrigation Scheme aims to
improve irrigation water delivery to, and management in, the command area.
After a long gap, the Bank re-engaged in the agriculture sector through the Agriculture
Commercialization and Trade Project. It aims to improve the competitiveness of smallholder farmers
and the agribusiness sector in selected commodity value chains in more than 25 districts supported by
the project. Similarly, the Agriculture Food Security Project (AFSP) in West Nepal aims to improve food
and nutrition security in the 19 remote and food deficit districts in West and far-West Nepal.
While many of the Bank’s investment/sector operations mentioned above also support social inclusion, a
more direct initiative in this area that received Bank support is the Poverty Alleviation Fund (PAF). PAF
channels resources to the poorest groups in rural communities by creating infrastructure, employment
and income-generating opportunities.
Following the devastating earthquakes in April and May 2015, the Bank responded with the $200 million
housing reconstruction project which will support rural housing reconstruction of about 20 percent of
the houses destroyed in the earthquakes. The project is highly relevant and timely as there is a clear
need for housing reconstruction, which was the largest single need identified in the Post-Disaster Needs
Assessment (PDNA) – roughly half of the total recovery needs of all sectors. Following the June donor
conference, there has been good progress to establish the technical foundation of the program. The
Bank is supporting the completion of the Government’s Program Operational Manual that will define the
implementation arrangements for the housing reconstruction program. Much progress has been made
and most technical details have been finalized. The program has been developed through close
collaboration with various government agencies, and other stakeholders.

NEPAL

The Bank has recently approved the Development Policy Credit (DPC) which is the second budget
support program in a series of three DPCs. DPC1 was for US$ 30 million signed in June 2013 while DPC3
is expected to be implemented in FY16 with major preparatory actions being completed with support
from DPC2. The overall objective is of the DPCs for the financial sector is to support the reform program
initiated by the Nepalese authorities to reduce the vulnerability of the banking sector and increase its
transparency. It is noteworthy that the preparatory work for DPC2 was completed against the backdrop
of the devastating earthquake last April. The earthquake disaster has heightened a number of
vulnerabilities and presented new challenges. With this in mind, the original planned amount of DPC2
has been increased by US$ 50 million to a total of US$ 100 million. This was done under the IDA’s Crisis
Response Window to ensure the ongoing financial sector reforms are not derailed due to earthquake
and to provide additional post-earthquake financing support to the Government of Nepal.
Areas in which the Bank leads and its analysis serves as input into the IMF program
The Bank takes the lead in assisting Nepal with public expenditure analysis. In addition, the Bank’s
intensive dialogue and technical assistance have been supporting the reforms, including the
development of a credible Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). Under the ownership and
leadership of government, the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Assessment II was
recently completed. This has ushered in joint government and donor partnership collaboration in
penning the next PFM reform action plan, which is expected to ensure efficient budget allocations for
priority projects.
The Bank and IMF have been jointly advising the Central Bank of Nepal in regulating the financial sector
through a Development Policy Program that is working on its second phase.
Areas of shared responsibility
The Bank and IMF continues to provide assistance in the overall management of the country's
macroeconomic aggregates. They have assisted in debt management through technical assistance, joint
Debt Sustainability Analysis and policy dialogue to ensure that the overall debt stock and fiscal deficits
are within reasonable limits. To sustain the impressive revenue growth, in addition, they continue to
provide policy advice and technical assistance.
The Bank and IMF also work closely together on providing support to financial sector strengthening,
most recently through carrying out a joint Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). WBG support to
the financial sector aims to address economic risks stemming from the sector’s rapid expansion and
associated distress in the banking sector. To address financial-sector vulnerabilities, the Bank has been
providing technical assistance in the areas of crisis management, bank resolution and deposit insurance.
A FY13 Development Policy Operation (DPO), developed closely with DFID and the IMF, helped to
address some of the root causes of the sector’s difficulties. A follow-up DPO – building on the FSAP as
well as a DFID-supported banking sector diagnostic – will aim to consolidate banking sector stability and
pave the way for developing a more robust and inclusive financial sector.

C. World Bank Group Strategy and Lending Operations
World Bank Group support to Nepal is aligned to its twin global goals—eliminating extreme poverty and
boosting shared prosperity. A poverty “lens”, developed for the new CPS, concludes that while Nepal’s
8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NEPAL

progress on poverty reduction was commendable, a significant share of the population remains
clustered around the poverty line. It confirms the need for WBG support to focus on removing Nepal’s
binding growth constraints to allow for higher income levels. In this context the International
Development Association (IDA), the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral
Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) will continue to foster its ongoing collaboration to make
maximum use of its joint comparative advantage. WBG efforts will be organized within two pillars.
Under pillar 1, it will support increasing economic growth and competitiveness, and will focus on
hydroelectric power generation, enhancing transport connectivity, and improving the business
environment. Under pillar 2, the WBG will provide support to increasing inclusive growth and
opportunities for shared prosperity, by enhancing the productivity of agriculture, equalizing access to
health care, skills development and social protection. Cutting across these pillars, WBG activities will
contribute to improving the effectiveness, efficiency and accountability of public expenditure.
WBG support will be guided by the principles of balancing risks and rewards, selectivity and flexibility. In
a shift from more cautious approaches taken in past strategies, the WBG will engage in larger programs
that strive for nation-wide impact. Regarding selectivity, this strategy consolidates WBG’s engagement
into fewer sectors, where the Group has a comparative advantage and can leverage its financing and
analytical resources for greater development impact. In addition, the WBG will maintain programming
flexibility, given the politically-fragile country environment.
Within each of the CPS pillars, the strategy identifies specific areas where the Bank Group can make a
difference. For IDA, these include transport, energy, education/skills, health, and public expenditure
management. For IFC, these include supporting hydropower, improving access to finance, facilitate new
private investments and reduce the barriers of investment in priority sectors, promote tourism and
support agribusiness. IDA and IFC expect to work together on hydropower development, agriculture,
and improving access to finance.
FY15 Lending Program: FY15, eight projects were delivered with a total value of IDA US$541 million
and TF US$16 million, with a total delivery of US$557 million.
Bank Assistance Program in Nepal:
As of end of FY15, the Nepal portfolio consisted of 23 Active Investment Projects (which include four TF
Projects above US$ 5 million – Nepal Agriculture Food Security Project, PPCR Climate Hazards, SREP
Supported Extended Biogas Project and Road Safety Activity under RSDP) with net commitments of US$
1,861.58 million (of which IDA net commitments are US$ 1,768.71 million and TF net commitments are
US$ 92.87 million) and undisbursed balance of about US$962.87 million (of which IDA portion is
US$887.43 million and TF portion US$75.44 million). This indicates about 52 percent undisbursed
balance from net commitments. In addition, the Nepal portfolio consists of one DPC Project for
Financial Sector Stability with net IDA commitments of US$100 million.
Economic and Sector Work: The World Bank Group is also engaged in analytical and knowledge
dissemination exercises. It provides regular economic updates and advises the Nepalese authorities on
key economic policies. It also works with partners and the government on analyzing poverty trends in
Nepal. For example, with support from the UK’s Department for International Development and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

NEPAL

Denmark, the Bank worked closely with the Central Bureau of Statistics to complete the latest Living
Standards Survey (NLSS 3), to provide core data on poverty trends and access to services.
IFC is supporting the Nepal Business Forum (NBF), a public private dialogue platform established by the
GoN in 2010, which brings together over 40 government and private sector agencies to dialogue and
review government policy and regulation towards the private sector, with the aim of improving the
effectiveness, and accountability of private sector policy making, and regulatory enforcement. Given the
political uncertainty and civil unrest, the NBF has been an important tool in helping the country
Activities of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in Nepal
Since it resumed operations in 2009, IFC’s committed investment portfolio in Nepal stood at $40
million as of March 4, 2014, consisting of power, transport, banking, microfinance, tourism, and trade
finance lines. IFC invested in 14 projects (for $57 million in total) over the last ISN period (FY12 and
FY13) and 6 projects (for around $4 million in total) in FY14 as of March 4, 2014. Most recently, IFC’s
investments include hydropower investments, an airline expansion, and credit for trade financing. For
FY15, IFC has mobilized and invested directly US$ 54 Million with investments in Hydropower,
Tourism, Agribusiness and Trade finance. FY 15 is the first fiscal year where IFC was able to mobilize
other funders (Canadian Climate change fund, FMO and GAFSP) for its private sector investments in
Hydropower, Agribusiness and tourism.
On the advisory services side, IFC is engaged in a range of areas including investment climate, access
to finance and sustainable business advisory. Besides, there is also a pipeline of advisory projects in
the PPP transaction space. IFC’s advisory services has strengthened multifold, from an active portfolio
of $1.3 million in FY09 (three projects) to $12.8 million as of February 2014 (10 percent of South Asia
Portfolio), across 12 projects in Nepal. Some high impact ongoing programs in the country include:
Investment Climate Reform Project; enhancing access to finance through strengthening the payments
system and credit bureau, and improving sustainable energy finance practices; and promoting climate
resilient agriculture. A strong pipeline of projects has been developed to continue the transformative
work. Some of the upcoming projects include work in the Nepal hydro sector which is a IFC/World
Bank joint initiative and includes support for impact investments and sector wide adoption of E&S
standards; scaling up renewable energy and SME banking programs; and development of PPP
transactions in critical sectors.
Going forward, IFC will seek to continue the programs aligned with the three strategic pillars of IFC’s
South Asia Strategy which includes: (a) inclusive growth; (b) climate change; and (c) regional and
global integration. IFC will continue to prioritize on the hydropower sector, financial sector and
agribusiness. IFC’s additionality in Nepal comes through providing longer tenor financing than is
available in the market, patient equity capital, crisis response products such as liquidity facilities,
global and regional expertise and experience, and technical assistance to enhance areas such as
corporate governance and management of environmental and social risks. IFC aims to continue to
respond to client needs through facilities such as SME Venture Fund, Infraventures, transaction advice
for PPPs, and risk-sharing facilities. As local currency financing is essential for companies and sectors
that generate local currency revenues, including large scale infrastructure hydropower-projects, IFC
plans to continue its effort in partnership with IDA, with the GON to create such instruments.

refocuses on economic growth by facilitating constructive dialogue on constraints to investment, trade
and export, and finance and credit.
In addition, IFC’s advisory service continues to facilitate new private investments and reduce the barriers
of investment in key priority sectors including tourism, agriculture, finance, and infrastructure (especially
hydropower). IFC is supporting the GoN with PPP transaction advisory to assist in evaluating its priority
projects through a Memorandum of Understanding with the Investment Board of Nepal. Under this
MoU, IFC will provide support to the development of feasibility studies, strategic options for particular
projects, development of contract documents, as well as support and capacity building to take these
projects to market.
Other ongoing IDA/IFC work is laying the foundation to help Nepal transform to a climate resilient
development path—consistent with poverty reduction and sustainable development goals—with
financial support from the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience and other climate investment funds. IFC
is working with leading agribusiness firms to improve agricultural and water management practices,
introduce new technologies among smallholder farmers producing rice, maize and sugarcane to help
them adapt to climate change. The objective is to expand the agriculture sector in Nepal using
sustainable and replicable climate smart models in order to improve farmer resilience.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
Country Program
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) began lending to Nepal in 1969. As of 31 December 2014, Nepal has
received 167 loans/grants—133 sovereign ADF loans ($3,433.8 million), 5 non-sovereign loans ($52.8
million), and 34 ADF grants ($823.75 million) totaling $4,310.3 million. Nepal Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) 2013–2017, approved in October 2013 is more selective, with a bulk of the CPS resource
envelope allocated to operations in energy, transport, and urban infrastructure and services, followed by
agriculture and education. Five thematic priorities—gender equality and social inclusion, environmental
sustainability, good governance, regional integration, and private sector development will be
mainstreamed in ADB operations. The portfolio of active sovereign ADF loans and grants as of 31
December 2014 consists of 39 ADF projects and programs (24 loans amounting to $1,253.7 million and
26 grants amounting to $502.3 million) with an overall net amount of $1,756.0 million.
The assistance approved in 2014 comprised five projects with a total of $325 million in ADF loans. The
projects include the SASEC Power System Expansion Project ($180 million); Additional financing to
Community Managed Irrigated Agriculture Sector Project ($30 million); Additional Financing to
Melamchi Water Supply Project ($25 million); Additional financing to South Asia Tourism Infrastructure
Development Project ($30 million); and Third Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project
($30 million).
Technical Assistance
As of 31 December 2014, ADB has approved technical assistance (TA) projects totaling $184.4 million. As
of 31 December 2014, there were 26 ongoing TAs amounting to $35.4 million. Twenty one investment
projects and 6 TAs, which are about 54% and 23%, respectively, of the ADB’s Nepal portfolio, are
currently being administered by Nepal Resident Mission.
Private Sector Operations
ADB’s private sector operations in Nepal began in 1989. As of December 2014, cumulative approvals in
four projects amounted to $58.6 million.
One of the major private sector projects is the 60-MW Khimti Hydropower project, which was approved
in 1996. ADB's private sector operations will focus mainly on hydropower development, both for
domestic sale and for export to India although many constraints to investment remain and further policy
dialogue is required. Moving forward in the energy sector, ADB’s private sector arm will look into
private sector-led investments on a case-by-case basis.
ADB's Trade Finance Program (TFP) fills market gaps by providing guarantees and loans through partner
banks in support of trade. TFP has done over 9,000 transactions supporting over $19 billion in trade and
over 4,000 SMEs across the region since 2004. In 2013 alone, TFP supported $4 billion in trade through
over 2,000 transactions. In Nepal, the TFP works with two banks and has supported over $69.7 million in
trade between 204 transactions. In addition to filling market gaps, the TFP’s objective is to mobilize
private sector capital/involvement in developing Asia. In Nepal, 51% of the $69.7 million in trade
supported through the TFP was co-financed by the private sector. There are currently no outstanding
guarantees for the Nepalese banks. In 2014, it supported one transaction amounting to $17,187.50.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of October 15, 2015
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Economic and financial data are broadly adequate for surveillance, with scope for

improvement especially in fiscal data (external financing), more detailed price statistics, and the
timeliness and quality of balance of payments data.
National Accounts: The Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) compiles national accounts using
the methodology of the 1993 SNA. Key estimates include GDP by industry (in current and constant
prices) and by expenditure categories (current prices), and gross national income and savings.
Some expenditure categories continue to be affected by limited source data, particularly for
household final consumption, although with the commencement of continuing annual household
surveys will eventually lead to improved estimates. The CBS has plans for a major revision of the
national accounts, to incorporate improved source data and methodology where possible, and to
update the base year for the constant price measures from 2000/01 to 2010/11, but the timing is
uncertain. Previous STA missions (latest in January 2014) assisted the CBS to develop quarterly
GDP estimates, but progress has been hampered by staff turnover and limitations with source data
in terms of range of data and timeliness.
Price Statistics: The Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) compiles the consumer price index (CPI). A new
CPI series with 2014/15 as base year (from previous base year of 2005/06) has been released in
October based on a new household expenditure survey. Initial plans had been made to transfer
the responsibility of compiling the CPI from the NRB to the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). A
core inflation series is not published, although underlying data necessary to calculate such a series
appear to be available. NRB also publishes a wholesale price index (WPI), with weights based
on 1999/2000 data. Broadly, the index covers agricultural commodities (49.6 percent), domestic
manufactured goods (20.4 percent), and imported goods (30 percent). The CBS has received TA to
update and expand the producer price index (PPI) to include other economic sectors. Current PPI
coverage is restricted to manufacturing. As well, an index of wages and salaries is compiled and
published, with base year 2004/05.

Government Finance Statistics: Authorities began to compile fiscal data in accordance with
IMF’s Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) in 2011, an important step forward.
Still the budget classification needs further improvement to exclude financing transactions from
the functional classification of expenditure, make a more clear distinction between revenue and
transactions in nonfinancial assets, subsidies and capital payments to enterprises, and other
improvements to ensure full consistency with the GFSM 2001. Meanwhile, treasury single account
(TSA) has been rolled out to all 75 districts including Kathmandu, which allows for more timely and
accurate fiscal data reporting and monitoring. However, a number of fees collected outside the
budget, foreign aid directly paid by donors, the operations of extrabudgetary entities and local
governments are not reported in the annual budget, and there is no compilation of the
government’s balance sheet in accordance with the GFSM 2001. Government finance statistics are
regularly reported for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook, but not in the IFS.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NEPAL

Monetary and Financial Statistics: Following up on the recommendations of a 2009 STA mission
that NRB broaden the coverage of monthly monetary statistics to include development banks and
finance companies, the NRB now compiles and publishes an expanded broad money survey, which
is a significant step forward.
There is room for improvement in the reporting of data on the interest rates. At present, key policy
rates including t-bill, interbank, and NRB policy rates are available, but deposit and lending rates
of commercial banks are not well reported, while those of development banks and finance
companies are not reported at all. It may be useful to report the prime lending rate of top 5
commercial banks, as well as average deposit rates of the same, to provide a sense of the
movement over time. At present, maximum and minimum rates are reported, which remain
relatively fixed over time and are not very informative.
Data on the NRB’s claims on other depository corporations (ODCs) are not consistent with the
data on the ODCs’ liabilities to the NRB because ODCs’ liabilities include only refinance and repo
credit from the NRB; separate data on the NRB’s deposits at the ODCs are currently not available
and therefore are excluded from the ODCs’ liabilities to the NRB.
External sector statistics: The NRB compiles and disseminates balance of payments (BOP)
statistics in conformity with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Statistics Manual (BPM5).
Balance of Payments statistics present several shortcomings in terms of coverage, classification,
and data sources. Key shortcomings in BOP statistics are: (i) underestimation of imports, and to a
lesser extent exports; (ii) significant problems in measurement of remittances; (iii) incompleteness
of data on foreign grants, making it difficult to classify current vs. capital, and official vs. private
grants; (iv) absence of direct investment data; and (v) unrecorded financial flows. In February 2015,
the NRB started reporting international investment position (IIP) data following the sixth edition of
the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6).
Nepal is a participant of the Japan Administered Account for Selected IMF Activities (JSA) project
on the Improvement of External Sector Statistics-ESS (BOP, IIP, and External Debt Statistics-EDS) in
the Asia and Pacific Region. Since 2012, NRB has been receiving technical assistance in the area of
ESS. The 2013 STA mission has observed important progress in the implementation of
recommendations of previous TA missions. Thus, for first time, the NRB has compiled IIP, resumed
the compilation of EDS, and improved the compilation of direct investment. In the area of data
source, the mission has continued redesigning the International Reporting System (ITRS), the main
collection source for compiling BOP and IIP, and assisted the authorities in improving the surveys
for collecting direct investment and trade credit data.
Overall the quality of BOP data has improved with the support of IMF STA technical assistance (TA)
and training of the NRB staff through ESS IMF HQ and regional courses.
II. Data Standards and Quality

The country is a General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS) participant since May 2001.
Metadata were initially posted on the
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board in
May 2001 and last updated in January 2009.

Data ROSC on fiscal transparency was published in
October, 2007.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
November 16, 2015
1.
This statement provides an update regarding the disruption to transportation
and trade in the south of Nepal and its implications for economic activity. This
information does not alter the thrust of recommendations contained in the staff report but it
does alter the staff’s assessment of the downside risks to the near-term macroeconomic
outlook.
2.
The disruption to transportation and trade routes to and from the southern
border started two days after the September 20 promulgation of the new constitution.
All petroleum products consumed in Nepal are imported from India by truck. During the last
fiscal year, oil imports represented 15 percent of Nepal’s total goods imports, amounting to
US$1.1 billion or 5.3 percent of GDP. The Nepal Oil Corporation (NOC) is the sole supplier
of petroleum products in Nepal and the India Oil Corporation (IOC) is the NOC’s sole
supplier. With fuel transports into Nepal coming to a virtual halt, the NOC announced in late
September that only limited amounts of fuel would be supplied for private vehicles, to slow
the drawdown of Nepal’s limited petroleum reserves.
3.
The prolonged disruption to trade has resulted in a fuel crisis with an
increasingly adverse macroeconomic impact:


In recent weeks, in the absence of viable alternative ways for Nepal to secure adequate
fuel in the short term, economic activity has been slowing markedly. The NOC
announced on November 9 that it would no longer sell fuel for use in private vehicles
and instead prioritize the remaining stock for sales to the security forces.



With winter approaching and shortages of essential supplies worsening, the near-term
outlook for Nepal’s population is becoming bleak, particularly for those who became
homeless as a result of the earthquakes in April and May. Delays in starting with postearthquake reconstruction are compounded by the trade disruption. Fuel shortages are
affecting the delivery of emergency supplies to remote regions affected by the
earthquakes.1 On November 10, in response to acute shortages of cooking gas, petrol,

In the context of a November 10 press briefing by a United Nations spokesperson, the Secretary-General
reiterated his concern over the obstruction of essential supplies on the Nepal-India border. Acute shortages
in fuel supplies continue to impede planned deliveries to earthquake-affected villages in Nepal.
Humanitarian organizations urgently require fuel to maintain operations and deliver food, warm clothing
and shelter materials to high altitude areas that will soon be cut off by harsh winter weather. The SecretaryGeneral underlined Nepal’s right of free transit, as a landlocked nation as well as for humanitarian reasons,
and called on all sides to lift the obstructions without further delay.

2
diesel and kerosene, Nepal’s Forest Ministry announced that it would start to provide
firewood as an alternative means of fuel.
4.
Downside risks to the near-term outlook have become more pronounced. The
media in Nepal report that, following a Cabinet decision on November 9, a written request has
been sent to the government of India to help end the ongoing problems at the border and ease
the supply of essential goods, including cooking gas, petroleum products and medicine to
Nepal. To the extent that the trade disruption is not resolved soon and comprehensively, it will
be increasingly difficult for overall economic activity to catch up and register positive growth
in this fiscal year. Industrial production and tourism are badly affected by the unavailability of
fuel and other essential inputs. Government revenue, particularly customs revenue, is down
considerably. And so is government spending. The rebound of growth, to 4.4 percent in
2015/16 (mid-July 2015-mid-July 2016), projected in the staff report is predicated on a
marked increase in government capital spending as well as reconstruction activity by the
private sector. Over the past three years, government capital spending through mid-November
averaged only about 6 percent of the total for the fiscal year. As noted in the staff report,
during the Article IV consultation mission the authorities were confident that capital budget
implementation would again pick up after the end of the festival season in mid-November.

Statement by Marzunisham Omar, Executive Director for Nepal
Pornvipa Tangcharoenmonkong, Alternate Executive Director
and Thomas Benjamin Marcelo, Senior Advisor
November 16, 2015
1.
The Nepalese authorities express their appreciation to staff for the constructive
engagement and policy dialogue during the 2015 Article IV Consultation. The authorities
found that the discussions were appropriately focused on macroeconomic and financial sector
policies, as well as structural reforms that struck the right balance between supporting
Nepal’s post-earthquake reconstruction efforts while maintaining macroeconomic and
financial stability. They are broadly in agreement with the thrust of the staff appraisal and
would take staff’s policy recommendations into consideration in the implementation of their
macroeconomic policies and post-earthquake development agenda.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
2.
The earthquakes in April and May 2015 resulted in significant loss of lives and
property. The total damages and losses in production are estimated at about US$7 billion,
equivalent to nearly one-third of GDP. Real GDP, which has grown by an average of 4.5
percent in the last five years, grew by only 3.0 percent in 2014/2015 as a result of the
devastation caused by the earthquakes, with the tourism, infrastructure, real estate,
agriculture and finance sectors adversely affected. Inflation moderated to 7.2 percent in
2014/2015, on account of lower oil prices, lower inflation in neighboring countries, and
effective liquidity management by the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB). The headline inflation for
the first two months of 2015/2016 (mid-July to mid-September 2015) averaged 7.05 percent.
3.
Despite the growing import requirements of post-earthquake reconstruction, Nepal’s
external sector situation further strengthened in 2014/2015 with the balance of payment
surplus reaching US$1.43 billion, from US$1.29 billion in the previous fiscal year, due
mainly to the current account surplus, supported by sustained overseas remittances. This has
enabled Nepal to maintain adequate gross foreign exchange reserves of US$8.28 billion as of
mid-September 2015, which is more than 11 months of imports of goods and services.
4.
The authorities earlier projected a GDP growth of 6.0 percent for 2015/2016 on
account of the expected significant public and private sector investments in reconstruction
and expansion in economic activities. However, the prolonged drought, the trade blockadelike situation in the southern part of the country and the ensuing fuel crisis have delayed the
start of recovery and reconstruction-related projects, posing risks to the growth and inflation
outlook. Nonetheless, the authorities are optimistic that the effective and inclusive
implementation of the new constitution and the measures to accelerate government spending
would reap significant growth dividends from the restored political stability and facilitation
of economic growth.
Fiscal Policy
5.
The authorities agree with staff’s recommendation that fiscal policy needs to support
post-earthquake reconstruction and medium-term growth through higher public investment.

2
As announced in the 2015/2016 budget in July 2015, the authorities will establish a National
Reconstruction Authority (NRA) to coordinate the implementation of rehabilitation and
reconstruction activities over the next five years. The authorities remain committed to
ensuring the passage of a new bill in parliament that will allow the establishment of the NRA
and put recovery efforts back on track.
6.
On improving revenue performance, the authorities agree with staff on the need to
enhance enforcement of tax compliance and further strengthen tax administration to
strengthen the fiscal position. However, given the substantial development requirements and
available fiscal space, the authorities can increase domestic borrowing while putting in place
measures to avoid crowding out private investment.
7.
While the fiscal position remains strong, the budget surplus reflects modest revenue
growth and continued underspending. The authorities therefore recognizes that there is an
urgent need to accelerate post-earthquake reconstruction, provide assistance to earthquakeaffected households and businesses, increase priority social spending and improve the
effectiveness of safety nets. In the annual budget for 2015/2016, more than US$8 billion was
allocated for reconstruction and development, with US$740 million for the National
Reconstruction Fund. The authorities have also prioritized budget allocation to agriculture,
education, health, tourism, infrastructure development, connectivity and the construction of
hydroelectric power plants.
8.
To accelerate capital expenditure, the authorities announced steps to expedite the
approvals process and simplify administrative procedures. A Public Financial Management
(PFM) reform action plan was also developed, in line with past Fund PFM technical
assistance. Budget allocation for unimplemented and slow-moving projects will be redirected
to ongoing and better performing projects. Likewise, projects that have detailed feasibility
studies and whose environmental assessment and land acquisition requirements have been
completed will be prioritized for implementation.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
9.
The authorities are in favor of an accommodative monetary policy stance to support
economic recovery. In 2015/2016, monetary policy is aimed at supporting the attainment of a
GDP growth of 6.0 percent, containing inflation within 8.5 percent, and maintaining foreign
exchange reserves equivalent to at least 8 months of imports of goods and services. Once
economic conditions normalize, the authorities will aim to keep inflation close to that of
India. The exchange rate peg to the Indian rupee will help to ensure that India’s disinflation
gains would lead to lower inflation in Nepal.
10.
On liquidity management, the NRB will continue to conduct deposit auctions,
introduced in August 2014, to effectively mop up excess liquidity. The authorities agree with
staff’s recommendation to refine the liquidity monitoring and forecasting framework,
building on suggestions made in the context of past technical assistance from the Fund. The
NRB is currently studying various approaches, including the interest rate corridor
framework, to refine the monetary operations framework in implementing monetary policy to
strengthen the monetary transmission mechanism. They expressed interest in receiving IMF

3
technical assistance on systemic liquidity management, which would involve developing an
appropriate liquidity forecasting framework, defining monetary operations consistent with
monetary policy objectives, identifying instruments, and laying out the operational
modalities.
11.
The authorities welcome staff’s assessment that the exchange rate remains in line
with macroeconomic fundamentals. Staff’s assessment have taken into account countryspecific factors that are relevant to Nepal, such as the significant role of remittances,
notwithstanding the conflicting results and wide range of estimates of the External Balance
Assessment. The authorities will continue to maintain a pegged exchange rate to the Indian
rupee, which has served Nepal well by providing a transparent and stable anchor for the
conduct of monetary policy.
Financial Sector Policy
12.
To help ease the impact of the devastating earthquakes, the NRB has put in place
temporary regulatory relief for banks in the affected areas to enable them to continue to
extend credit to borrowers. Among others, the limited and time-bound relief measures cover
loan-loss provisioning, loan rescheduling and restructuring, and provision of grace periods
for loan repayment. As announced in the 2015/2016 budget in July 2015, the NRB helped to
establish an Economic Rehabilitation Fund to provide a refinancing facility and interest
subsidy on loans extended to earthquake-affected areas covering residential construction,
agriculture, and tourism.
13.
The authorities broadly agree with staff’s recommendations on further improving the
stability and resilience of the financial sector and will continue to implement reforms to
further enhance the legal and supervisory framework governing banks and financial
institutions (BFIs), in line with the 2014 FSAP recommendations. As announced in the
2015/2016 monetary policy statement in July 2015, the NRB seeks to consolidate the
banking industry by encouraging the merger of BFIs through an increase in paid-up capital
requirements. Further, NRB directives were issued on the buying and selling of branches of
problem banks and on the migration to chip-based card from magnetic strip card for debit
and credit cards, as part of security and risk mitigation measures for card protection and
electronic payment transactions.
14.
The authorities are cognizant of the importance of financial inclusion and have
pursued various policies and programs to improve access to financial services. These
include: (a) branching policy outside of Kathmandu; (b) provision of interest-free loans to
facilitate the establishment of branches in underserved areas; (c) reinstatement of bank
branches closed during the conflict period; (d) licensing of new microfinance institutions;
(e) introduction of branchless banking and mobile banking; and (f) implementation of
financial literacy and financial consumer protection initiatives. The NRB will likewise
continue its directed lending facilities to achieve the government’s inclusive growth
objectives.
15.
The NRB also expressed interest in receiving technical assistance in developing a
strategic plan to implement the 2014 FSAP recommendations on various areas of BFI

4
supervision such as bank licensing and regulation, implementation of the Nepal Financial
Reporting Standard, further enhancements to prudential regulations and development of a
reformulated corrective and enforcement actions framework.
16.
The NRB welcomes the preliminary findings of the ongoing Safeguards Assessment
in connection with the 2015 Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) disbursement, which gives due
recognition to the authorities’ significant progress in adopting a new accounting system and
improving financial reporting practices. The authorities will continue to pursue further
reforms in strengthening the NRB’s governance and control frameworks as recommended by
the safeguards assessment mission in September 2015, particularly on the internal and
external audit mechanisms, currency and vault operations, and the NRB’s legal framework.
Structural Reforms
17.
Notwithstanding the setback to growth from the devastating earthquakes, the
authorities remain committed to implementing its ambitious structural reform agenda under
Nepal’s 13th Development Plan (2013-2016), which aims to transition Nepal from least
developed country status by 2022. The authorities remain steadfast in accelerating economic
reforms to promote higher and more inclusive growth and achieve faster poverty reduction.
18.
The authorities are undertaking the necessary structural reforms to remove major
bottlenecks to public and private investment and improve competitiveness and the business
environment. This necessitates substantial investments in transport infrastructure to expand
connectivity within Nepal and with neighboring countries, and in energy infrastructure to
increase energy supply through hydroelectric power generation. The authorities recently
announced the policy framework for public-private partnership in order to facilitate private
sector participation in the development of much needed infrastructure, such as roads, bridges,
hydroelectric power plants and transmission lines.
19.
As announced in the 2015/2016 budget and monetary policy statement, the authorities
are prioritizing the submission and/or passage of key legislations in order to deliver on its
structural reform agenda: (a) law on foreign investment and technology transfer to improve
the investment climate; (b) laws on a unified tax code, revenue leakage control, and central
revenue board to strengthen revenue administration; (c) laws on foreign exchange regulation,
restriction on investments abroad, regulation and supervision of savings and credit
cooperatives and microcredit institutions, and social security to enhance the efficiency and
regulation of the financial sector; and (d) law on land use as part of efforts to strengthen risk
and disaster management.
Concluding Remarks
20.
The authorities would like to extend their gratitude for the continuing provision of
humanitarian aid and allocation of grants and concessional loans by the international
community for the rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts. The authorities would also like to
thank the Fund for its ongoing support through policy advice, technical assistance and the
swift RCF disbursement of SDR 35.65 million. This has greatly assisted the authorities in

5
addressing Nepal’s growing balance of payments need and catalyzes further resources for
post-earthquake reconstruction and development.
21.
Nepal has achieved important progress over the past years in implementing sound
macroeconomic policies and critical structural reforms to facilitate economic growth,
improve economic conditions and reduce poverty. The country is recovering from the impact
of the earthquakes in April and May. The new government is forging a stronger consensus
among key stakeholders to implement the new constitution and lay the foundations for
supporting Nepal’s post-earthquake reconstruction and drive towards high, sustained and
inclusive growth. The authorities recognize the challenges ahead and are determined to
pursue the structural transformation of their economy and boost economic growth and
competitiveness by removing bottlenecks to public and private investment in key sectors.
22.
The authorities look forward to continued discussions with the Fund on a
comprehensive package of macroeconomic and financial sector policies and structural
reforms that could be supported by an Extended Credit Facility. Therefore, the Fund’s
appointment of a full-time IMF Resident Representative in Nepal would be timely and
critical to reinforce the effectiveness of the Fund’s engagement with Nepal.
