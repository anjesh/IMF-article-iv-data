I. SUMMARY AND APPRAISAL
Israel was well situated when the global financial turmoil began in the fall of 2007
1.
Fiscal and monetary credentials were established in markets; banks and their
supervisory arrangement were robust; and growth was strong, sustained, and balanced.
Though public debt is much reduced, to around 80 percent of GDP, it remains a vulnerability.
2.
That set the stage for a relatively strong performance into the third quarter of 2008.
As conditions deteriorated abroad, economic growth continued. And although domestic
securities prices tracked those abroad downwards, prompting outflows from provident funds,
flows in domestic credit markets remained largely undisturbed. In this context, capital
inflows and the Shekel strengthened.
Since the fall of 2008, challenges facing policymakers have deepened profoundly
3.
With the intensification of financial strains internationally, global demand,
prospects, and securities markets slumped, and the Israeli real sector showed the first signs of
strain. Declines in commodities prices, inflationary pressures, policy interest rates and the
Shekel provided some respite. With elections due in February, the 2009 budget will not be
adopted until well into the new year.
4.
There is little sign that global difficulties will ease soon. Recessions in the U.S. and
Euro areas are anticipated through the first half of 2009, but their length and depth is highly
uncertain
5.
With Israeli investment and exports weak, the staff central scenario anticipates a
decline in economic growth to ½ percent in 2009, with average inflation around 1½ percent.
A modest recovery is projected for 2010. However, financial sector vulnerabilities abroad
imply that risks are firmly to the downside, notwithstanding strong profiles for external
amortization and short term external debt.
Despite the global origins of present challenges, strong domestic policy can help
6.
Policy needs to be well coordinated, with steps to strengthen long-run credibility
increasing scope for flexibility in addressing immediate exigencies. In summary, we
recommend, in the central scenario context, key steps to support credit flows and stability, a
flexible near term budget stance backed by enhanced commitments to public debt reduction
in the medium-term, and further monetary relaxation. These recommendations are subject to
review should significant downside risks materialize.

4
Progress—notably concerning stability and credit flows—has already begun
7.
Policymakers’ immediate attention has rightly turned to the nexus of concerns
regarding credit flows and financial stability.
8.
The recently approved public-private fund to purchase corporate bonds is welcome.
It should be established promptly and tasked primarily to support new credit flows for large
solvent firms. Alongside, the initiative to streamline procedures to reorganize corporate
bonds is welcome.
9.
Given these steps to support credit flows, other financial sector initiatives should
focus on further strengthening bulwarks against extreme strains on banks. This includes the
proposed guarantee for bond issues by banks, which is an appropriately pre-emptive step to
increase bank capital. Restrictions on dividend payments by participating banks would
maximize its effect.
10.
In addition, the technical review of legal provisions concerning troubled banks is
welcome. The mandated rapid publication of lender-of-last-resort actions for publicly traded
companies should also be reviewed to ensure that this policy instrument is fully effective in a
crisis context.
11.
The package of initiatives outlined above constitutes a first step. If downside risks
materialize, abroad or domestically, more may be needed.
On the fiscal side, flexibility is required
12.
There is a clear case to allow automatic stabilizers to operate fully given the degree
of fiscal credibility. But the likely relatively moderate extent of the economic slowdown
in 2009 and the still high debt ratio counsels against going much further than that.
13.
Accordingly, the structural fiscal balance in 2009 should be unchanged from 2008,
excluding the financial sector support initiatives described above and any already-committed
investment and infrastructure projects which are brought forward. This stance leaves
essential “fiscal firepower” in reserve should downside risks materialize, and it underscores
commitment to fiscal sustainability. All these desiderata are implicit in the deficit outturns
likely to emerge from implementation of the draft 2009 budget, which is therefore
appropriate.
But flexibility requires enhanced credibility
14.
The draft 2009 budget, the policy initiatives described above, and the fiscal outlook
for 2010 could imply headline budget deficits for consolidated general government well in
excess of 4 percent of GDP in 2009 and 2010. These are large numbers and public debt ratios

5
will rise. This underscores need to reinforce confidence in long run fiscal sustainability.
Adjustments to the framework of fiscal rules will help to address these concerns.
Credibility might best be secured through adjustments to the fiscal rules
15.
The one-year ceiling on the deficit of 1 percent of GDP needs to adjust to allow the
operation of automatic stabilizers in 2009. Building on recent proposals from the Ministry of
Finance, one alternative could be to replace it with a formal commitment to reduce public
debt to well below 60 percent of GDP during the middle years of the next decade. This
objective would be backed by new budget procedures laying out annually and in detail how
and when the ultimate debt objective would be realized.
16.
This flexible framework would also allow an effective fiscal response in the event
that significant output downside risks materialize immediately during 2009, which a
monetary response cannot fully address.
17.
And the other fiscal rule—the annual cap of 1.7 percent on real spending growth—
may also need to be amended. Instead, adoption of caps for three years ahead on annual
nominal spending, excluding emergency outlays, has merit. This framework would be highly
transparent, would improve the operation of fiscal stabilizers, and would buttress monetary
responses to inflation surprises.
In this context, monetary policy can take the lead
18.
On the monetary side, the advantages of the inflation targeting and flexible
exchange rate frameworks are now more apparent than ever. Furthermore, the creditsupporting and financial stability initiatives outlined above will help to maintain the
effectiveness of the domestic monetary transmission mechanism, while the suggested fiscal
policy and framework steps reduce need for the Bank of Israel (BoI) to weigh upside risks as
it pursues the inflation target. Both will allow monetary policy to play its maximum role in
addressing external weakness and uncertainties.
19.
Even after the most recent monetary easing, inflation is still set to fall below the
target range for much of 2009 with indicators of inflation expectations remaining very
subdued. If the outlook for output continues to deteriorate, with policies as outlined above,
scope therefore remains for further reductions in policy rates.
Strong reserves and planned adjustments in the BoI law will boost credibility further
20.
Increased international reserves—now over 100 percent of short-term debt—have
attenuated external vulnerabilities. Purchase modalities under the program appropriately
avoided any discretionary intervention.

6
21.
Preparations for a new BoI law are welcome. In particular, provision in the draft law
for establishment of a monetary policy committee of well qualified experts to determine the
policy rate is appropriate.
Nonetheless, the outlook remains uncertain
22.
Even with policies thus calibrated to address the coming slowdown and downside
risks, prospects are challenging. While much has been done, planning for contingencies
needs to proceed further and urgently.
23.

Israel should remain on the standard 12–month consultation cycle.
II. THE CONTEXT—2004–08 1

Israel has enjoyed sustained balanced growth (Figure 1)
24.
Real GDP growth rebounded strongly from the 2001–03 slump, averaging over
5 percent since then (Table 1, Figure 1). Export of goods and services supported employment
and incomes, spurring private consumption and investment (Figures 2 & 3). Despite the
deteriorating merchandise trade balance, strong transfers kept the current account in surplus.
Inflation has been subdued and inflation expectations were well-anchored by the Inflation
Targeting (IT) regime. These assessments are shared by the authorities (¶68).
This has reflected and supported strong fiscal and financial sector policies
25.
In this context, public debt was lowered from 100 percent of GDP in 2003. This was
secured by adoption and adherence to fiscal rules—a cap of 1.7 percent on annual real
expenditure growth (excluding emergency security-related items) and deficit ceilings for
central government. The general government structural primary balance strengthened steadily
from 1½ percent of GDP in 2004 to 2¼ percent in 2007, and public debt fell to just under
80 percent of GDP in 2007.
26.
Far reaching financial sector reforms proceeded alongside (Table 2, Attachment I).
These have significantly diversified financial markets, reflected in a switch from bank
towards nonbank credit—including corporate bond issuance—to the business sector.

External vulnerabilities are contained, and competitiveness remains firm
27.
Strong policies have supported resilience and competitiveness (Box 1). Accordingly,
despite gross external debt of some 43 percent of GDP, the net International Investment
Position (IIP) has also strengthened further, with overall liabilities only modestly exceeding
assets currently, and gross debt liabilities less than gross debt assets in the short-term and
overall. Alongside, although indicators are mixed, competitiveness appears comfortable. The
recent Shekel appreciation provided an opportunity, in the authorities’ view, to implement a
program of reserve accumulation to attenuate external vulnerability further (¶75).
Box 1. Competitiveness and the Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate
After a six year period of weakness, the Shekel appreciated about 20 percent in real
terms in 2007, returning to its long-term average (See Figure 4). The trend current
account balance was the mirror image of this pattern—relatively strong in the period of
six year shekel weakness, and deteriorating more recently (though remaining positive
through the third quarter of 2008).
On balance, the Shekel appears to be around its equilibrium, in light of various
indicators. Abstracting from the temporary boost from the dot.com bubble to Israel’s
high tech exports and hence its overall export market share, penetration of global
markets has remained broadly stable, Export growth remained firm until late 2008
when the weakening of the global economy began to be felt. Also, (i) some of the
weakening in the merchandise trade balance reflects strong—and likely sustainable—
income and net transfers from abroad (even if both weaken in the immediate period
ahead); (ii) there are few signs of loss of labor competitiveness, either from relative
unit labor cost measures or unemployment; (iii) and trade in services is still in surplus.
These assessments are supported by the CGER estimates.

Strong macroeconomic developments reflect policies consistent with past staff
recommendations (Box 2).
Box 2. Implementation of IMF Recommendations
Fiscal policy and framework. As recommended, a sustained program of fiscal consolidation
and debt reduction has been implemented, secured in part by adoption and adherence to a
home-grown medium-term fiscal deficit target framework. Recommendations to strengthen
fiscal transparency and governance remain outstanding.
Monetary policy: In the context of a strong inflation targeting framework, the BoI has
enhanced its communications with the markets, including through regular publication of fanchart projections.
Financial sector: Given ambitious financial sector reforms, the authorities have been fostering
their capacity to supervise the increasingly complex domestic financial firms and markets.

In 2008, however, external shocks brought new challenges
29.
Soaring global food and fuel prices first raised inflation concerns. Thereafter, as
global financial turmoil deepened, output prospects weakened even as global commodity
prices fell back. In this context, S&P downgraded its rating for Israeli sovereign foreign
currency credit one notch to stable in late October 2008.
Monetary policy adjusted swiftly
30.
Under the IT regime, monetary policy adjusted nimbly to this shifting environment
(Figure 5). When external price shocks—compounded by diminishing economic slack—
pushed headline inflation substantially above target, policy rates were raised gradually by
75 bps in the five months to February 2008 to 4¼ percent. With inflation expectations
apparently anchored, rates were then lowered in light of global and domestic output
concerns, albeit with a temporary reversal in this trend when high CPI outturns from April
suggested residual inflationary challenges. But as the global financial crisis deepened later in
the year, interest rates have been reduced appropriately since 2008 September, in six steps to
1 percent (¶70). Indicators of medium-term inflation expectations slumped, albeit rising
modestly in recent weeks. Inflation nevertheless remained above target at end–2008.

And overt banking sector strains have been relatively few
31.
Banking vulnerabilities appeared to have been contained, so far. Bank losses due to
ABS exposures were minimized as they were sold early in 2008, leaving marginal remaining
exposures.2 Banks remain profitable, largely deposit-funded, and strongly capitalized
(significantly above the legally required ratio of 9 percent), despite some exposure to failed
international institutions (See Text table and Table 2). There is little sign of stress in money
markets, notwithstanding sharp falls in banks’ share prices and the associated distance-todefault measures—mirroring similar falls for other domestic and global financial firms
(Figure 5). The only sign of a change is the increase in non performing loans (Box 3).

Bank Hapoalim (with 30 percent of total banks’ assets) wrote off NIS 3 ½ billion in Q1 2008, leaving
exposure of NIS 1½ billion and yielding overall loss for the quarter of some NIS 1½ billion, returning to profit
in Q2. Bank Leumi (the second largest bank) reported ABS exposures of about NIS 6 billion, largely guaranteed
by FNMA. ABS exposures of other banks appear small.

15
Box 3. Why was Israel’s financial sector not more affected by
the global financial crisis ?
Although Israel is highly integrated in the global economy with free capital mobility and
extensive international trade and financial flows, financial markets held up relatively
well compared with other small open economies (Figure 6). The shekel has strengthened
until recently despite foreign exchange purchases by the BoI, and has been less volatile
than many other currencies. Although the drop in equity prices was similar to other
markets, the volatility has been smaller. Furthermore, bank share price falls have been in
line with non-bank declines, a much better performance than elsewhere. The drop in
corporate bonds has been similar to the global drop in corporate bonds with similar
volatility. Finally, while global money markets came under severe stress, the overnight
inter bank market in Israel has continued to operate calmly, albeit that it comprises only
inter bank overnight lending.
The relative strength of the financial sector is a result of conservative banking practices,
transparency, and the longstanding implicit government guarantees that anchored
confidence. Until the reforms of the last few years, banks benefited from strong market
power, which provided little incentive to develop sophisticated financial instruments and
move away from relatively conservative practices (See attachment I). The recent reforms
increased competition and banks started to explore new markets abroad as well as new
lines of businesses. However, for lack of time since reform was initiated, when the
global crisis commenced, Israeli banks’ exposures remained limited.
In addition, transparency has been high. The small and intimate size of the banking
system, and the enhanced regulations that required more detailed reporting helped
maintain confidence in the integrity of available information. This was boosted further
by enhanced transparency rules adopted over the past year.
Finally, confidence in the ability of banks to meet their obligations was enhanced by the
implicit government guarantee to support the banks and guarantee deposits. Indeed, the
Minister of Finance issued a statement supporting this presumption, and the government
has a track record of intervening to save banks and guaranteeing deposits.
Yet, stability may have come at a price. While the implicit government guarantees may
have successfully avoided overt stress, the implicit transfer of risk to the public sector
may have been reflected in increased yields on government bonds.

Non bank financial institutions have suffered, however.
32.
The value of provident funds declined by about 20 percent in 2008, while some
mutual funds lost even more. More importantly, withdrawals from provident funds amounted
to NIS 8 billion (or about 5 percent of their total assets) in 2008. The corporate bond market,
which was the main source of new corporate credit in the previous year has de facto closed.
Yields in the secondary market rose significantly and new bond issues have halted since
September.
The overall banking sector resilience may have buoyed net capital inflows during 2008
33.
The robustness of the banking sector and the supportive policies may also account
for the strength of the currency during most of 2008. Israel has been something of a safe
haven, with residents repatriating capital from more hostile global environments. In the
context of the consequent upward pressure that the BoI in late March announced its intention
to increase foreign exchange reserves by $10 billion during a two year period, taking reserves
to between $35–40 billion. In July, the announced pace of accumulation was raised,
reflecting the absorptive capacity of the market, and in November the target range was raised
to $40–44 billion. By end–December the reserves had reached $41½ billion.
Signs of strains in the real sector and the budget have emerged, however
34.
Since September, global financial conditions have deteriorated further. The
unfavorable asset market and export developments have impaired private consumption and
investment, with merchandise imports also reflecting the strong shekel. Activity thus cooled
significantly in the second half of 2008, with consumer and business confidence weakening
along with global prospects. This is expected to bring the overall 2008 growth to 4¼ percent.
35.
In this context, notwithstanding an over performance in the first half of 2008 and
tight expenditure control by the authorities, significant revenue shortfalls in recent months
are expected to bring the full-year budget deficit for central government to 2 percent of GDP
(Table 6), with the structural primary balance weakening to ¾ percent of GDP. Public debt
stands at little below 80 percent of GDP at end-2008.
And political and geopolitical uncertainties have recently mounted
36.
General elections are now scheduled for early February 2009 after negotiations to
reconstitute the coalition government broke down. With adoption of the 2009 budget
therefore delayed until at least the Spring, spending will be capped each month until adoption
of the full budget at 1/12 of the 2008 budgeted levels. Further, if the conflict in Gaza
resumes, that would pose risks to real activity and public spending, though the economic and
fiscal implications have been modest, so far.

18
III. NEAR TERM OUTLOOK AND RISKS
External factors continue to weigh on near term prospects
37.
As the authorities envisage, assuming that the Gaza conflict does not resume, the
outlook is likely to be dominated by the ongoing consequences of sustained global financial
turmoil, with corresponding weakness in commodity prices only a partial offset (¶69).
Growth in the imports of Israel’s trading partners, averaging 7 percent annually in recent
years, is projected at -1½ percent in 2009. Activity is anticipated to recover only in 2010.
Spillovers from the U.S. seem particularly pronounced
38.
Staff work indicates strong spillovers from the U.S. to Israel (see Attachment II).
Possibly reflecting close trade linkages—including through exports of intermediate inputs
through third countries—a 1 percentage point increase in the U.S. quarterly economic growth
is statistically associated with as much as ½ percentage point rise in Israel’s GDP over two
quarters. On the other hand, neither global stock markets nor oil prices appear to be major
determinants of Israeli activity.
So Israeli output trends are set to follow those in the U.S. closely
39.
In this light, domestic demand is projected to weaken further in 2009 reflecting the
global slowdown, the impact on net trade

Various downside risks are associated with this outlook
•

Global risks are to the downside of the WEO central forecast, and the Gaza conflict
could resume.

•

Israeli government debt is high, at some 80 percent of GDP and is associated with
needs to finance significant roll-overs and current fiscal positions.

19
•

If major defaults in the domestic corporate bond market occur, this could compound
constraints on access by healthy corporations to refinancing.

•

Though direct bank exposure to ABS is limited, economic slowdown could impair
credit quality and prices of securities held by banks could continue to fall. Thus,
although banks’ total risk-adjusted capital-asset ratio is relatively high at 11 ½
percent, raw equity is some 6 percent of assets and both major banks issued profits
warnings for the latter part of 2008.

•

Furthermore, risk of disorderly withdrawals from nonbank financial institutions
remains, and insurance companies have suffered losses on their assets as financial
markets have fallen.

•

As elsewhere, tail risks, including in the financial sector, may materialize with little
warning.

But these are mitigated by various factors
•

On the external side, banks’ short-term external debt is more than matched by
deposits abroad; private sector short-term assets are more than twice the size of shortterm debt; and only a small portion of public external debt matures within one year.

•

External public debt rollover needs are modest. US$3.4 billion (NIS 12 billion) of the
total US$30 billion in external debt was due in one year from end-September, 2008.

•

Public financing for the next several months has largely been secured.

•

Almost half of all external public debt is guaranteed by the U.S. government. In 2003,
the United States approved a new loan guarantee program for up to US$9 billion,
subject to certain understandings and deductions. That program has been extended
until 2011. Another third of the external debt is comprised of State of Israel Bonds,
where the Diaspora constitute the major and hitherto stable source of demand.

•

The economy has shown a capacity for rapid adjustment, as in its resilience during
the 2006 war and its sharp rebound from dotcom bubble, and as reflected in the rapid
response of inflation expectations and monetary policy to global developments since
October 2008.

•

Several stimulating policy measures—including advancing infrastructure investment,
extending credits to small enterprises, establishing public-private corporate bond
funds, and guaranteeing new capital raised by banks—have been approved (see
Attachment I).

20
•

The economy was cyclically strongly placed to face these challenges.

•

Though banks’ expansion into new domestic and global markets—the fruit of earlier
financial sector reform—has had, as yet, uncertain effects on their credit risk
exposures, the fact that this expansion has been only recent may, fortuitously, have
limited their direct exposure to the ongoing global turmoil.
IV. IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICIES AND POLICY FRAMEWORKS: 2009–10

40.
The economy has proven comparatively resilient so far, even in the face of
heightened global financial sector turmoil since September 2008. But a growth slowdown is
underway and, following global trends, is set to continue through 2009 even if domestic
banking sector stability continues. And continued economic stability is not certain, not least
with external risks firmly to the downside.
41.
In that context, the immediate priority is to ensure that the financial stability
framework is ready to address downside tail risks should those materialize. Alongside, the
medium-term focus of fiscal policy should strengthen so as to continue steady reduction in
debt and the associated vulnerability. But this should not impede operation of automatic
stabilizers during the downturn. In this fiscal context, with the monetary transmission
mechanism relatively undisturbed by recent global financial turmoil and inflation pressures
diminished, monetary rather than fiscal policy should remain the instrument of first recourse
to support activity, with the interest rate remaining the primary instrument used to achieve
that goal. This stance would leave fiscal resources available to cope with possible
materializations of downside risks.
A. Financial Sector Policy and Framework
Downside tail risks should constitute the immediate focus for policy
42.
Frameworks for crisis preparedness are needed for the support and resolution of both
banks and non-banks. These should address liquidity and capital adequacy issues, and
corresponding public interventions. As the authorities agreed, although the legal framework
is in general adequate to address banking crisis and has worked formerly when banks failed,
some aspects might need to be further reviewed. These include the framework for dealing
with failures of large banks and non bank institution, notably the legal recourse for affected
shareholders, and the mandated transparency of use of lender-of-last-resort facilities by
publicly traded companies (see Box 4) (¶72).

21
Box 4. Is Israel Ready to Address Financial Instability, if it occurs?
1.
Market liquidity, and ELA facilities. The Governor appropriately enjoys wide
discretion to determine the instruments, pricing, and collateral arrangements for
emergency liquidity operations to support individual banks and the banking system.
Thus, any shortfalls can be rapidly addressed. Nonetheless, a particular concern
warranting review is the mandate under stock exchange listing requirements for
financial firms to rapidly announce any LOLR facilities they receive.
2.
Bank resolution framework. The banking ordinance gives the Governor the
power to takeover a bank. In particular, if the Governor, after consultation with the
Supervisor, is of the opinion that a particular banking corporation is unable to meet its
obligations, he may with the approval of the Government, appoint, without delay, an
administrator to manage the banking corporation. It will be key to ensure legal capacity
to complete such operations speedily, should they become necessary. In this regard, it
will be important to strengthen provision for preemptive bank resolution by the
regulator, notably via restriction of legal recourse for affected stakeholders to financial
compensation only.
3.
Coordination amongst the authorities. Given the more complex financial system
that has emerged due to recent reforms and the need for close cooperation between
supervisors, the central bank, and the Government, strong technical capacity to manage
and resolve financial stress is needed. A recent Memorandum of Understanding among
the supervisors, as well as exercises that test responses to crisis scenarios are welcome.
4.
Non-banks. Readiness to handle weakness in a large non-bank financial
institution is unclear. While forms of appropriate support will vary from case to case,
early consideration of options and risks that may arise is needed.

43.
The corporate bond market has been under strain. Accordingly, the authorities have
temporarily suspended mark-to-market rules for institutional investors, up to a maximum of
3 percent of their assets and only if the institutions commit to holding the bonds to maturity.
This has brought a measure of relief to the corporate bond market, while retaining the
principle of transparency for the bulk of institutions’ accounts. And the Israeli security
authority has proposed a detailed and flexible blueprint for procedures to reorganize
corporate bonds.
44.
Furthermore, the authorities have approved the establishment of a NIS 10–20 billion
fund to purchase corporate bonds (see Attachment I). NIS 5 billion of this will come from
public sources which bear most of the risk. While the authorities preferred to consider the
options for the specific objectives of this fund further, staff suggest that the prime functions

22
of the fund would be to refinance bond installments as they fall due and to support new bond
issues, because these directly support credit to firms (¶71). In this light, purchases by the
fund on the secondary market would generally be avoided as these will not provide new
credit, and they risk implicitly transferring accrued institutional investor or corporate losses
to the budget. While plans should be prepared to address priorities in the corporate bond
market other than credit flows, the tasks for this fund should not be extended lest its
effectiveness and accountability is diluted. Given these terms of reference, the anticipated
size of the fund is sufficient at least through 2009.
45.
Against the backdrop of continuing initiatives to buttress supervision of all financial
firms during 2008—enhancing capital, reporting, monitoring, transparency, and regulatory
coordination—the steps above could help maintain orderly financial market conditions under
conditions of duress.
Alongside, more deep-seated reforms should remain under review
46.
The ongoing process of financial sector reform continues to require corresponding
review of the supervisory regulations and structures. However, as noted by the authorities,
given that the immediate priority is management of tail risks, implementation of
organizational reforms which might cause a temporary loss of focus on tail risks should be
avoided, even if those changes are aimed at better supervisory arrangements in the long run
(¶72).
47.
In particular, whatever the best long run allocation of bank and non-bank
supervisory tasks between the Central Bank and other agencies, the immediate priority is to
ensure that the flow of information from banks to the central bank remains uninterrupted.
48.
Similarly, consideration of action to implement a deposit insurance scheme would
best await the easing of global financial market tensions lest such action call into question the
meaning of the authorities’ commitment to financial market stability. Eventual
implementation of formal deposit insurance could provide an appropriate opportunity to exit
from the current implicit deposit guarantee.3
B. Fiscal Policy and Framework
A strong medium-term budget framework would underpin fiscal credibility, and so
facilitate accommodation of stabilizers in 2009

3

In 2008, an international committee of experts (MONEYVAL) noted that Israel is considerably exposed to
organized criminal activity and related money laundering. The authorities are strongly encouraged to address
the highlighted deficiencies.

23
49.
The ongoing progress towards debt reduction over the medium term needs to
continue to reduce the associated vulnerability (See Figure 7 & Attachment III). Accordingly,
staff have earlier suggested—and reiterate—that the government endorse the Minister of
Finance’s proposal of an objective of debt of below 60 percent of GDP in the medium term.
This goal reflects the EU ceiling as expressed in the Maastricht criteria. But it should be a
minimum objective; Israel’s unique vulnerabilities—including those arising from geopolitical
considerations—call for a more ambitious debt goal over the longer term than may be
appropriate for EU countries.
50.
But with a further growth slowdown in prospect, macroeconomic policies should
provide appropriate support, while maintaining confidence.
51.

Accordingly, adjustment of the fiscal framework needs to weigh two considerations.

•

On the one hand, there is need for a flexible framework given uncertainties about the
economic outlook.

•

On the other hand, adjustment of the strong rules and procedures that have delivered
strong fiscal outcomes in recent years, raises risks that budget discipline may be lost.

The revenue and deficit estimates in the draft 2009 budget have been overtaken by
events
52.
The draft 2009 budget envisages full implementation of the programmed tax cuts of
about ½ percent of GDP, and observes the pre-set deficit target of 1 percent of GDP by
anticipating a marked reduction in expenditure growth (Text Table). On the authorities’ fiscal
projections, the structural primary surplus implied by the draft budget is roughly 1 percent of
GDP, representing a modest improvement from 2008, and public debt is expected to fall to
77 percent of GDP.

53.

Four factors are of concern, however.

•

First, the draft budget’s growth and therefore revenue estimates may prove optimistic
as real GDP growth appears unlikely to reach the assumed 3½ percent for 2009. If
growth is closer to ½ percent, fiscal revenue would likely be much weaker than
projected by the draft budget—especially since the size of automatic stabilizers tends
to be larger during downturns. In such scenarios, either the operation of automatic
stabilizers will have to be constrained, or the headline 1 percent deficit ceiling would
be breached.

•

Second, the structural primary surplus implied by the 2009 draft budget falls short of
the steady-state structural surplus of 3¾ percent of GDP needed to lower debt to
60 percent of GDP within the next decade. While this stance may be appropriate
given the cycle, it also underscores need for a strong medium-term framework to
deliver the necessary primary balances to realize the debt objective.

•

Third, the technical estimation of the structural primary surplus should reflect a
cautious assessment of the automatic stabilizers. In particular, past buoyancy in fiscal
revenue in part reflected the excesses in the global financial markets before the
outbreak of the current crisis. In that light, future tax collection ratios may be unlikely
to return to the levels seen in recent years, even after the global crisis passes.

•

Fourth, ongoing political and geopolitical uncertainties are inevitably reflected in
risks to budget prospects.

Accordingly the 2009 budget deficit target should be modified and the medium-term
framework strengthened
54.
In this context, as agreed with the authorities, the cap on the headline budget deficit
ceiling for 2009 should be adjusted to accommodate full operations of automatic stabilizers
(¶73). It should also accommodate, without offsets, the fiscal and financial-sector initiatives
recently approved by parliament, and any already-planned investments which are brought
forward investments as these leave the NPV of anticipated government spending over the
medium-term unchanged. Implementation of the expenditure estimates in the planned 2009
budget would be consistent with these recommendations (see Text Table). Nevertheless, the
headline deficit outturns will be large relative to the recent past, underscoring need to sustain
confidence by elaborating a formal framework to deliver ambitious medium-term debt
objectives.
Key characteristics of the current fiscal framework should be retained
55.
The current targets, established in 2006, cap real expenditure growth at 1.7 percent
beginning in 2007 and set ceilings on the headline deficit. Excluding emergency security

26
spending, they have been adhered to, so far. The key elements of this framework that would
best be retained include simplicity, robustness, and compliance.
A new framework could formally be anchored by debt reduction, with scope for
appropriate fiscal flexibility
56.
The authorities share the view that reforms to the current fiscal framework are
needed. They recognize—and staff agree—that any new framework should reflect six
principles:
•

Fiscal policy in Israel should be guided by rules

•

Those rules should have a medium-term focus, targeting debt reduction

•

Automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate unimpeded

•

The key instrument to deliver the debt objective is expenditure caps

•

Spending caps should exclude emergency allocations for security.

•

In this context, the deficit target of 1 percent of GDP for 2009 should be relaxed

57.
In this light, the authorities have proposed
a new framework that entails elements of an “error
correction” mechanism. The proposed framework
would automatically constrain (loosen) real
expenditure should debt rise above (drop below)
the envisaged adjustment path due to breaches.4
The explicit link between spending and debt is a
clear advantage in the system.

There may be scope to increase the flexibility of the framework in three dimensions,
however. First, establishment of a range of dates—e.g., the middle years of the next
decade—rather than a single year for the debt target may improve the flexibility of policy in
the face of a highly uncertain global outlook. Second, adoption of caps on spending in
nominal rather than real terms may better accommodate automatic stabilizers—with
cumulative errors in inflation projections corrected only after three years, rather than all
4

For a general discussion of error correction mechanisms for Israel, see IMF Country Report No. 08/63,
February 2008, Chapter IV “Towards a New Fiscal Rule: What might work well for Israel?”

27
inflation errors corrected after one year. This more extended correction mechanism would
also help monetary policy to reduce inflation volatility. Third, rather than an automatic error
correction mechanism tied to debt, a less formal link has merit to accommodate output
surprises. It could be based on adoption of new budget procedures mandating publication of
full medium-term budget projections as part of each budget, showing exactly how and when,
and in accord with the predetermined caps on nominal spending, the debt objective was
expected to be met. These projections would take into account, each year, new information
on output prospects, allowing annual policy on fiscal deficits to respond flexibly to
developments, while maintaining the credibility of the medium-term anchor. In the context of
agreement with staff on the six principles outlined above, the authorities were inclined to a
less flexible framework, notwithstanding global uncertainties (¶74).
C. Monetary Policy and Framework
Inflationary pressures have abruptly eased
59.
Given global and domestic developments, inflationary pressures have eased
markedly since the fall of 2008 and remain contained, even after the late January policy rate
cut. Monthly inflation peaked in August with core inflation measures continuing subdued.
And an undershoot of the 2009 inflation target is now anticipated
60.
Markets still anticipate a further modest reduction in the policy rate—some 25bp in
coming months—and, associated with that, evidence from surveys and financial market
instruments suggests that the inflation target will be undershot by end–2009. Given the
expected policy rate, the recommended fiscal stance, and WEO projections for commodity
prices and Israeli output in 2009 and beyond, such an undershoot indeed still appears likely.
On balance, the bank rate could be lowered further
61.
In these circumstances, and in the context of the staff recommended fiscal policy,
both for 2009 and beyond, several considerations should guide whether, and to what extent,
the policy rate should be lowered further.
•

Even if indicators of inflation expectations understate likely outturns, falling
commodity prices and activity, long-contained nominal wage behavior, and recent
sharp reductions in international central bank interest rates underscore that the
domestic and global inflationary concerns even of a few months ago have
substantially dissipated.

•

In balancing risks, a case to err on the side of caution is not persuasive. Indicators of
inflation expectations for 2009 and beyond are now below target, with liquiditypremia distortions to such indicators likely minimal (given similar liquidity for
indexed and non-indexed Israel government bonds). With inflation expectations so

28
low, output concerns remain considerable even with fiscal stabilizers operating (as
recommended) and domestic financial sector strains continuing to be limited.
62.
On balance, therefore, further early policy relaxation seems appropriate (¶76).
Concerns not to surprise markets with large steps may be attenuated with prior guidance and
by the increased market familiarity with large steps globally. And as policy rates approach
zero, options for quantitive easing should be considered in case that is needed.
The IT framework serves well, and appropriate strengthening is anticipated
63.
As the authorities noted, although inflation has frequently been outside the 1–
3 percent target range, inflation, inflation expectations, and nominal wages remain contained,
and indexation has declined (¶75).
64.
In this broad context, the proposed new draft BoI Law appears appropriate. The
proposal to increase the BoI independence, establish a committee with power to set monetary
policy, and a separate management committee to manage the bank’s administration.
However, provisions for BoI capital, staff remuneration, and legal protections for staff may
need to be strengthened.
Foreign exchange intervention should play at most a limited role in the framework
65.
As the authorities agreed, sizeable foreign currency reserves can provide a useful
signal of resilience to markets (¶75). Accordingly, a level equal to short-term debt has merit.
This ratio was realized by end-December as the reserves reached the target range of $40–
44 billion. Such a target should, however, also be set in light of the associated sterilization
costs (estimated at less than 0.1 percent of GDP so far).
66.
However, the bank rate should remain clearly the central instrument in the inflation
targeting regime. This requires, first, preannouncement of the schedule of purchases and the
targets for foreign exchange purchases, as reflected in the authorities’ actions in 2008. Once
the announced target has been reached, there may be a case to maintain the ratio relative to
short term debt. If so, this objective and the schedule of purchases to realize it over time,
should be preannounced. Second, maintenance of the pre-eminence of the bank rate also
requires restriction of discretionary intervention to combat disorderly conditions. And if
flows persist in either direction, the policy response should focus on the bank rate (¶75).

29
V. THE AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS 5
67.
There was broad agreement with staff that the recent intensification of global
financial stresses required policy responses in various areas, with many still yet to be
finalized. There was common ground on diagnosis and broad principles for the policy
response, with fiscal rules a particular focus of debate with staff.
68.
Sustained strong policies meant that Israel had been well prepared on the eve of
global financial turmoil, with public debt falling, low inflation and stable monetary
conditions, conservative and healthy banks, and a significantly improved international
investment position.
The immediate outlook has weakened
69.
Given global conditions, however, the near-term macroeconomic outlook was
challenging, including significant downside risks. The BoI’s latest growth forecast for
2009—at -0.2 percent—is a little below that of staff, but the BoI and staff were in close
agreement on the pace of recovery in 2010. And while the Ministry of Finance concurred
broadly that real activity in 2009 would slow sharply, it had not updated its macroeconomic
framework since submission of the draft 2009 budget. The macro assumptions underlying
that draft would be substantially marked down (¶37).
70.
Given the deteriorating outlook and associated declines in inflationary pressure, the
first response to intensified turmoil had been significant reductions in the Bank of Israel rate.
Thereafter, focus had turned to concerns with stabilization of the corporate bond market,
securing continued credit supply, and fiscal support for activity (¶30 &41).
Financial sector stabilization policy has been strengthened
71.
With the terms of reference for the proposed private investment fund with public
capital for the corporate bond market still in development, its purpose was broadly to support
liquidity, credit to solvent corporates whose main activity is in Israel and which face
difficulties in recycling their credit, and restoration of confidence in the market. Potential
conflicts of interest should be addressed and secondary market purchases may be warranted
on some occasions, for example as part of broader debt workouts. The relative importance of
raising capital ratios versus increased credit supply as the objective for the guarantee for
bond issues by banks was similarly under consideration. But pre-emptive action was
warranted in either case (¶44).

30
72.
Extensive arrangements have been made to strengthen information-sharing and
coordination amongst the regulatory authorities in the context of stresses in financial markets
since the fall of 2007. In that context, the review of readiness for contingencies undertaken
by the mission was welcome, and legal provisions guiding the resolution of troubled banks
and transparency of lender-of-last-resort would both be considered further. And hitherto
lively domestic debate on the appropriate organizational structures of financial regulation had
been largely suspended while policymakers and regulators’ focus remained on the immediate
challenges in markets (¶45–48).
Fiscal policy needs to be more flexible
73.
Turning to budget matters, the authorities agreed that the essential issue was how to
accommodate greater flexibility in the context of a downturn without losing momentum in
debt reduction and fiscal sustainability. In striking this balance, they concurred with staff that
to accommodate fiscal stabilizers, the 2009 deficit should exceed its ceiling under the
prevailing fiscal rules. And they agreed that some framework of firm fiscal rules was needed
nevertheless. While revenue would be lower than the estimates in the draft 2009 budget, the
Ministry envisaged that total nominal spending in 2009 would conform to the draft budget
ceilings. In this way, fiscal discipline would be maintained in 2009 and in the medium-term
(¶52–54).
74.
The Ministry of Finance’s preferred approach to reform of the fiscal rules was to
target public debt below 60 percent of GDP by 2015, underpinned by a ceiling on real
expenditure growth, adjusted downwards if debt overshoots its path towards the 2015 goal.
This framework constrains automatic stabilizers but aids the credibility of the medium-term
goal. And, in contrast to a ceiling on nominal spending, it implied lower volatility in annual
real spending. Finally, a framework with caps on nominal spending might be susceptible to
pressures to raise the ceilings should the inflation outturn be higher than expected (¶58).
Monetary policy options would remain under review
75.
On the monetary side, the IT framework remained appropriate and the accumulation
of reserves had been prudent according to a variety of metrics, and had been secured without
disturbance to the market. Further reserve accumulation seemed warranted by the continuing
buoyant market conditions, reflected in the strength of the Shekel, and by a desire to build up
resilience to further shocks. Going forward, proactive financial sector and prudent fiscal
policies would support monetary policies (¶27, 65 & 66).
76.
Sizeable interest rate cuts had been necessary to avoid undershooting the 2009 target
and strengthen the economy’s ability to cope with the effects of the global economic crisis.
While indicators remained mixed, the case for further rate reductions would remain under
review. However, reductions would have to be consistent with maintenance of market
confidence (¶61–62).

ATTACHMENT I. FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM: DIVERSIFICATION AND CREDIT CRUNCH1
1.
The Israeli financial system has undergone a comprehensive transformation
over the past few years. Reforms were significantly accelerated in 2005 with the
introduction of various legislative measures and changes in regulatory coverage and
taxation.2 Though these steps were contraversial and some mid course corrections were
necessary, they led to a rapid diversification of the financial sector towards non-bank
financial institutions and expanded the choice of financial products and providers. In the
process, new challenges have emerged for managing risks.
2.
The key pillar of the financial sector reform was the Bachar Legislation.
Implemented in July 2005, the legislation’s main objective was to enhance the development
of capital markets by
• Increasing competition and reducing concentration of financial institutions: This was
achieved mainly through decentralization of the financial system whereby banks were
required to sell their holdings of mutual funds and provident funds.
• Reducing conflicts of interest in the capital market: The Bachar legislation also stipulated
separation between advice on financial assets and their marketing through changes in rules
for employment in financial consultancy and marketing.
• Increasing foreign participation: Foreign-owned firms were encouraged to acquire stakes
in the fund management businesses being disposed by the banks. In addition, government
bond market reforms allowed entry of foreign-owned banks in the capital markets.
3.
Along with the Bachar legislation, reforms in taxation and regulatory coverage
were also introduced in 2005–06. These reforms sought to increase market efficiency,
encourage competition between players and enhance supervision of financial institutions and
services. Specifically, reform measures were implemented to:
• Widen investment choices of institutional investors: Tax provisions favoring domestic
investment were removed for private and institutional investors, which encouraged foreign
investment.
• Strengthen investor’s choice and rights: Regulations governing long-term savings were
revised, beginning in 2006, to ease mobility of savings between provident funds and
insurance plans. In April 2005, institutional investors were also required to provide a more
accurate fair value assessment of investor’s rights.

Prepared by Anita Tuladhar and Gil Mehrez.

See Appendix 1 for a list of the key measures of legislative and regulatory changes. Prior to the 2005 reforms,
measures ranging from pension and foreign exchange reform to government bond and capital market reforms
had been implemented.

38
• Improve supervision of institutional investors: In line with the change in the institutional
structure, supervision of the activities of the provident funds were initiated, while regulatory
coverage of insurance companies was expanded.
4.
The authorities have continued to consolidate the reforms with the goal of
deepening the capital markets and improving market infrastructure. To facilitate the
development of competitive and liquid markets, market makers were introduced in the
trading of government bonds in 2006. Repo auctions were introduced by the Bank of Israel at
end-2007. Repo trading in te Tel Aviv Stock Exchange is expected to start by the end of 2009
Q1. A new underwriting law was implemented in July 2007 allowing allocation of securities
at the underwriter’s discretion without an auction. Market infrastructure has been
strengthened with the introduction in June 2007 of the RTGS system for settling intraday
payments.
5.
Mobilizing long term savings in an efficient manner remains a key priority. In
December 2007, pension benefit coverage was expanded to employees without occupational
pension plans. Effective 2008, changes in regulatory coverage were introduced that subjected
a wide range of institutional investors to a uniform regulatory directive thereby equalizing
the terms of savings on all forms of long-term savings, both domestic and foreign. It has also
enabled banks to engage in pension advice and allowed a wide range of institutional investors
to offer a basket of alternative products.
Outcome
6.
These reform measures have resulted in a fundamental restructuring of the
financial sector towards non-bank institutions and non bank credit. A private long-term
saving industry separate from the banking

declined from 52 percent in 2003 to
11 percent at end-2007.
7.
The reforms also shifted the source of credit, in particular of new credit from
banks toward non-bank financial institutions. By end 2007, non-bank financial
institutions provided nearly 50 percent of the business sector’s outstanding credit, and most
of new credit in 2007. In particular, corporate bonds issuance surged in recent years reaching
about NIS 80 billion in 2007, and turnover in the financial market rose significantly. Most of

39
the bonds issued during 2003–08 were by real-estate companies (32 percent), and holding
companies (21 percent).
8.
However, since the beginning of 2008, the capital market came under stress.
Bond prices declined significantly, particularly since September of 2008 and withdrawals
from provident funds amounted to about NIS 5 billion in 2008. The surge in yields on
corporate bonds has been particularly high in bonds in the real estate sector, mainly in those
companies that invested in real estate projects abroad. In light of these developments,
concerns emerged that some bonds had been systematically over-valued and that investors,
notably provident funds were substantially exposed .
9.
Thus, overall credit—from banks and non-banks consolidated—declined since
September 2008, while bank credit has continued to expand at a normal rate. Bank
credit to the private sector expanded at an annual rate of about 10 percent, but the collapse of
the non bank credit caused overall sources of new credit to falter, despite the expansionary
monetary stance. Issuance of new bonds, which declined in the first half of 2008 compared
with 2007, stopped altogether from September.
10.
Looking ahead, credit conditions are likely to remain tight, with sizeable bond
amortization due. In 2009, bond repayments and interest will amount to almost NIS
25 billion. Most of it is by companies and financial institutions with high ratings, but about
NIS 3 billion is by real estate companies—many of which were downgraded recently.

11.
On the other hand, although banks are sound and liquid, they are unable to
meet the additional demand for credit. First, although banks are well capitalized, the

40
capital ratio of most banks is still below the 12 percent ratio which the bank supervisor has
encouraged them to achieve. Second, the slowdown in economic activity has raised credit
risks and will raise non performing loans, reducing the banks appetite for additional risks.
Finally, because banks’ role in overall credit has declined significantly, their influence on
overall credit is constrained.
Policy response
12.
The authorities have taken several specific steps to address strains in capital and
financial markets (See Box 1). These are anticipated to take effect during 2009.
13.
In addition, bank supervisors have intensified monitoring of banks exposures,
enhanced regulatory requirements, required additional public disclosure, and have
enhanced internal preparedness. In addition to increasing the frequency of reporting,
monitoring was intensified particularly in the areas of large credit and sensitive exposures,
provisioning for credit losses, exposures to foreign financial institutions, Nostro securities
exposures, and liquidity positions.
14.
At the same time the supervisor has issued various regulations. These include
instructing banks to review their business strategy and risk management policies, improved
reporting on exposure to foreign financial institutions, guidelines regarding effective control
over foreign offices, instructing banks to map their material exposures according to relevant
risk parameters, improving reporting on liquidity positions, and guidelines regarding fair
value evaluations. They also required additional disclosure with regards to investments in
complex instruments, enhanced risk disclosures in quarterly reports, and additional reporting
on country risk.
15.
Finally, the bank supervisor reviewed internal procedures regarding the
handling of banks in difficulties, analyzed closely options to enhance financial stability
(e.g. alternatives regarding capital injection, limiting capital distributions). And overall
coordination and information sharing between regulators--BoI, the MoF and the ISA—was
enhanced.
16.
The ISA responded to the global financial crisis in several dimensions. They
proposed establishment of new regulatory infrastructure to ease refinancing of bond
obligation in the capital market, and disclosure and transparency requirements were
increased. Examples of the latter include reporting on cash sources, value of collateral, and
exposure to the exchange rate, commodity prices and complex financial products. In
addition, it increased supervision of rating agencies and auditors.

41
Box 1. Policies to support capital and financial markets
1. Purchasing of corporate bonds. The authorities plan to establish several funds to purchase
corporate bonds, with the board objective to support liquidity and credit to solvent corporations
whose main activity is in Israel and which face difficulties in recycling their debt. The
government’s overall investment will be up to NIS 5 billion, matched by about NIS 5-15
billion from institutional investors. Each fund will be set for 7 years with an option to extend it
for an additional 3 years. To encourage private-sector participation in the fund, the government
will provide the following incentives. If at the termination of the fund, the average real return is
below 4 percent, the government will pay the intuitional investors 90 percent of the amount
needed to raise their return to 4 percent as long as the amount is below the government
revenues from the fund. If, on the other hand, the average real return is above 4 percent, the
government will pay the institutional investors half of its profits above 4 percent return.
2. Increasing banks’ capital. The government plans to provide guarantee of about NIS
6 billion for capital raised by banks to fortify banks’ capital and increase their lending.
3. Providing a safety net for long-term investors close to retirement. Savers who will retire
within the next 10 years, and who have less then NIS 1.5 million in retirement saving at the
time of retirement, can choose upon retirement whether to withdraw their retirement savings or
receive an annuity according to the amount (up to NIS 750 thousands) they had at
November 30, 2008.
4. Guaranteeing credit to small- and medium-sized firms. The government set up a fund of
NIS 1.3 billion ─ NIS 260 million of public money and NIS 1 billion from three banks who
won the tender to provide loans. To encourage banks’ participation, the government extends a
70 percent guarantee on the loans.
5. Reducing constraints on reaching agreements on the refinancing of payment
obligations to corporate bondholders. According to new measures by Israel Security
Authority, the trustees of bonds will be required in certain circumstances (or if demanded by a
party holding substantial portion of bonds) to convene a forum of bond holders. Such a forum
will require the presence of the three biggest holders of bond, who can delegate representatives
to negotiate with the issuer. The bond issuer is allowed to withhold disclosure about the
refinancing negotiation.

17.
The supervisor of insurance, pension and providence funds at the Ministry of
Finance responded to the crisis in the financial market mainly by increasing
monitoring. It increased monitoring of the insurance companies’ exposures to structured
financial instruments and investments abroad. It raised the monitoring of the institutions’
exposure to financial market and various instruments, their liquidity and withdrawal.

42
Conclusion
18.
The financial market reform achieved the goal of developing the capital market
and reducing the banks’ share in providing credit and managing long term saving.
However, the pace of the reform may have led to increased exposure to risks—more than the
risks that, ex ante, savers might have appreciated. It also raised significantly and rapidly the
importance of non bank credit. The collapse of this source of credit is thus a significant blow
to the economy—a clear instance of a “credit crunch.”

ATTACHMENT II. EXTERNAL SPILLOVERS TO ISRAEL 1
1.
As a small open economy,
Israel is susceptible to spillovers
from the global economy. Indeed,
12
Israel’s latest economic cycle
10
(since 2000) has to a large extent
8
mirrored that globally. The burst of
6
the dotcom bubble in the
early 2000s—compounded by the
4
intifada—pushed the Israeli
2
economy into a recession.

Subsequently, notwithstanding

security concerns in the mid-2000s,
Israel enjoyed a period of strong
economic performance alongside
robust global growth and low risk aversion.

Potential Channels
2.
Trade linkages are likely to constitute the main channel transmitting external
shocks to the Israeli economy. The share of exports in GDP rose rapidly—from 20 to 33
percent of GDP—between 1995 and 2007. The U.S. and EU together account for about 2/3
of these exports. While some diversification into the developing-country markets (especially
Asia) has been taking place slowly, and many of these are intermediate goods ultimately
shipped to the U.S. and EU.

Meanwhile, Israel’s foreign assets have also grown rapidly, even though on net
basis IIP remains modest at -10 percent of GDP. This followed the completion of capital
account liberalization in 2003 and subsequent extensive financial sector reform—including
the 2005 tax code change that reduced capital gains tax on foreign investment to the same
level as on domestic investment. Consequently, foreign investment income has become an
increasingly important element in the current account. The substantial increase in foreign
portfolio (PI) and direct investment (DI) exposures has likely increased spillovers via the
wealth and cash-flow effects.2

International financial flows might
also have considerable effects on the Israeli
economy. The size of Israel’s gross financial
inflows does not show any strong secular upward
trend, and they remain relatively modest by
international standards. However, the financial
inflows are volatile and—with their dip in 2001–
03 coinciding with the economic downturn—
appear to be closely associated with strains in the
global and Israeli economies.

Individually, PI exposure may have limited cash-flow effect (as bond coupons and stock dividends tend to be
relatively stable), and DI exposure may not produce strong wealth effect (as DI is largely evaluated on bookvalue basis).

Stable income source: Private current transfers

5.
Labor flows and current transfers,
however, did not appear to be important
channels in recent years. After the massive
migrant inflows in the early 1990s following
the collapse of the former Soviet Union,
Israel’s net labor flows have been relatively
small and steady. And while private current
transfers have risen and become sizable (about
3 percent of GDP), they appear to be stable
during the current cycle—indeed they might
even have provided the Israeli residents with
some insurance as they rose slightly during
Israel’s 2001–02 economic contraction.

Policy Spillovers
6.
Since the shekel became freely
floated in 2005,1 Israel’s monetary policy has
not always moved in tandem with the largest
countries’. This may reflect imperfect
synchronization business cycles and differences
in inflation developments. In general, however,
with Israel deeply integrated with the global
economy, there might be “policy spillovers”
where concerns about shekel’s relative strength
play an important role in monetary policy
decisions.
7.
On the other hand, fiscal policy
offered limited mitigation of external
shocks. Appropriate fiscal measures were
adopted to counteract the external shocks in
recent years, but—especially during the
downturn—the effects were limited. Burdened
with high public debt, the fiscal authorities
were not able to ease sufficiently (while

maintaining fiscal sustainability and credibility) to significantly forestall the negative
external spillovers.
Empirical Analysis
8.
Empirical analysis with vector autoregressive (VAR) models are carried out to
more systematically evaluate and quantify the external spillovers to Israel. Quarterly
data from 1995Q1 to 2008Q2 are used. This period is roughly characterized by the following
5 phases: 1) stable modest growth; 2) the dotcom boom; 3) burst of the dotcom bubble and
the intifada; 4) strong growth rebound supported by benign external environment; and 5) the
outbreak of the financial crisis and the beginning of global slowdown.
9.
The first step is to identify the key external determinants of Israel’s economy
over the near term. The variables included in this first-step VAR are (in that order): i) oil
price inflation—representing a global common shock (especially to the oil-importers); ii)
economic growth of the U.S. and EU—the two regions with the greatest direct economic
proximity with Israel; iii) returns on the major global stock market indices—proxying for the
international equity market conditions and sentiment regarding the near-term global
economic outlook; and iv) Israel’s own economic growth.
10.
The results suggest a very close tie between the Israeli and the U.S. economies.
Impulse responses show that a 1 percentage point increase in U.S. quarterly growth implies a
½ percentage point rise in Israel’s quarterly growth over 2 quarters. Moreover, shocks to
U.S. growth seem to have a rather persistent impact on Israel’s growth, albeit with lower
statistical significance beyond the second quarter.2 On the other hand, oil price inflation, EU
growth, and global stock market conditions appear to have weaker short-term associations
with Israel’s growth.3 Similarly, variance decomposition indicates that U.S. growth is the
single most important external factor explaining the variance of Israel’s growth after the first
quarter. (The error bands in the impulse responses below represent +/- 2 standard errors).

3

Incidentally, the Israeli stock market tracks closely the U.S. NASDAQ market.

The mild impact of oil price inflation might in part reflect the relatively low oil intensity of the Israeli
economy.

11.
In light of the initial results, the second step is to trace the mechanics through
which U.S. growth affects Israel. In particular, another VAR model with the following
variables is estimated: i) U.S. growth; ii) net trade’s contribution to Israel’s GDP growth; iii)
Israel’s private consumption growth; and iv) Israel’s GDP growth.

48

12.
Shocks to U.S. growth are found to stimulate both Israel’s private consumption
and net trade. A 1 percentage point increase in U.S. quarterly growth implies a
¾ percentage point additional expansion in Israel’s private consumption in the second
quarter, and a 1 percentage point rise in net trade’s growth contribution in the third quarter.
The impact on consumption might in part reflect (rational) anticipation of stronger net trade
performance in the subsequent quarter, but it is also likely driven by financial linkages and/or
other sentiment effects—especially since consumption shows little contemporaneous reaction
to the shock.4 On that score, trade connection appears to be just one of the multiple important
channels underlying U.S. spillovers to Israel.

Suppose rational anticipation is a key factor. Then at the impact of the shock, the consumers would at once
foresee the future net trade improvement, and immediately increase consumption accordingly.

ATTACHMENT III: EXTERNAL VULNERABILITY1
1.
Despite sustained balanced growth, significant external vulnerabilities remain
and the global financial turmoil raises new challenges. In particular, while most segments
of the economy have been resilient over the past year, the non-bank financial sector has come
under pressure and public debt ratios remain elevated.
2.
This note reviews indicators of vulnerability, including prices, stocks, and
flows, and evidence pertaining to policy credibility. Then after discussing lessons from
earlier periods of economic stress, the note lays out the key issues arising for policy, which
are discussed in the main body of the staff report.

The stock market is sharply down, in line with falls elsewhere.

•
The corporate bond market has fallen significantly. This follows the international
pattern, but also reflects problems specific, though not unique, to Israel. These include highly
leveraged investments abroad in real estate financed through corporate bond issues.
Previously large buyers, such as pension and provident funds, and insurance companies, have
come under significant pressure, through asset value losses and saving withdrawals.
•
Banks have appeared resilient in the current turbulent environment, but may not be
willing to extend enough credit to compensate for the shortfalls in new flows from corporate
bond market.

Key Exposures
The International Investment Position, External Debt, and Foreign Exchange Reserves
3.
Overall, the net International Investment Position is negative, but has been on
an improving trend. At end-June 2008, it was about -4 percent of GDP, an improvement by
more than 35 percentage points from the beginning of the decade. Importantly, there has been
a long-term shift from debt financing in the 80s and early 90s to non-debt financing.
4.
Nevertheless, total external gross
debt, at over 40 percent of GDP, is not low
and constitutes a key external vulnerability.
These risks are mitigated by several factors: total
external debt is less than the total holding of debt
assets; private sector short-term debt assets are
more than twice the size of its short-term debt;
and while most of the banks’ external debt is
short-term, it is more than matched by deposits
abroad. However, recent global experience
demonstrates that strong net-positions can turn
around rapidly. It is also not known to what
extent the debtors are the same as the holders of
the assets.

5.
Overall public external debt is fairly modest at about 15 percent of GDP. Only a
small portion matures in one year.1
6.
The foreign exchange reserves of the BoI are quite large, corresponding to over
100 percent of short-term debt. Strong market conditions have allowed the BoI to
accumulate international reserves in 2008. In late March, 2008 the BoI announced its
intention to increase the level of foreign exchange reserves by $10 billion during a two year
period to reach $35-40 billion. Initially, the daily purchases of foreign exchange was set to be
$25 million, but continued strong market conditions and a rapidly appreciating Shekel
motivated the BoI to change the daily purchases to $100 million. Subsequently, on
November 30, the bank announced that the target level had been raised to $40-44 billion.
The Current Account
7.
There is no evidence of a
fundamental imbalance in the current
account. Unlike some other fast growing
countries, the current account have been in
surplus in recent year with no apparent need
for a sharp improvement and the real
effective exchange rate is estimated to be
close to its equilibrium. In addition, positive
net transfers, which in the past have been a
stable revenue stream, constitute a cushion,
although a drop in contributions from
Jewish communities abroad may be
expected due to the global financial crises.

Public Debt
8.
Overall government debt, nevertheless, remains a vulnerability at around
80 percent of GDP. In the past, concerns about government financing have been an
important reason for capital outflows and pressure on the exchange rate. The large public
debt also restricts countercyclical fiscal policies during downturns or crises, e.g. borrowing
needs in a banking crises, and will be more expensive the higher the debt level. On the

In April 2003, the United States approved a new loan guarantee program for up to $9 billion. The United
States guarantees all payments of principal and interest. The program has been extended until 2011. The
proceeds of the guaranteed loans may be used to refinance existing debt. Under the loan guarantee program,
between September 2003 and November 2004 Israel issued notes totaling $4.1 billion.

53
positive side, a significant part of near-term financing needs have already been secured,
including via swap auctions.
9.
Israel has sources for public external financing which have been robust during
earlier periods of stress. Almost half of all public external debt is guaranteed by the
U.S. government. Another third is State of Israel Bonds, which in the past proven to be a
reliable and important source of financing for Israel, as many purchasers are individuals and
institutions, including the worldwide Jewish community, that have an interest in Israel. On
the other hand, the current global crises may have reduced the capacity of lenders and donors
to finance Israel. Their willingness to support may also be less as the current economic crises
is not mainly related to geopolitical events.
Banks and Other Financial Institutions
10.
The Israeli banking system appears to have relatively low direct exposure to the
current global financial crises. The direct exposures and losses due to asset classes
particularly hit have reportedly been small. Banks are also not heavily dependent on
wholesale funding, or on funding from any foreign parent banks.
11.
There are, nevertheless,
external vulnerabilities of Israeli banks.
Foreign currency credits accounted for
14 percent of bank credit to the public as
of end-June 2008 (including foreign
exchange indexed loans).1 Banks, and
other financial institutions, are also
exposed to external developments through
lending to Israeli corporations active
abroad. Export and investment abroad face
significant challenges as the world
economy seems to be heading into a sever
and possibly long lasting downturn, which
could lead to reduced repayment capacity.

Problems abroad for some bond issuers paired with general negative global
sentiment seem to be the main reasons for the weakness in the corporate bond market.
As a result, availability of credit for the business sector has been hit and sharply reduced as
corporate bond issuance has come to a halt. There is a clear risk, supported by anecdotal
evidence, that bank credit will be similarly tight, and not able to replace corporate bond
financing, in the near future.

Securing Near Term External Financing Needs, and Rollover Risk
13.
The strong track record is reflected in macroeconomic policy credibility. This
dampens Israel’s sensitivity to external shocks and enhances the efficiency and flexibility of
policy responses.
14.
As a result, sovereign credit ratings are on a long-tem upward trend. The
ratings have, moreover, held up during economic downturns and exogenous shocks (e.g. at
the time of the end of the dot.com boom and the
Intifada in the early 2000s).
2.5

15.
The credit ratings are reflected in
government bond yields. Yields on government
bonds, not guaranteed by the U.S., have been
higher than comparable U.S. bonds, on account
of Israel’s lower credit rating. But, the yield
spread has tended to be relatively stable around
1 percentage point and the increase during the
last 1½ years has been less than in many
emerging market economies.

Lessons from Past Experiences of Economic Stress
17.
Two periods of economic stress stand out in the last 30 years, when real GDP
growth was significantly below its average growth rate. Both periods demonstrate that
appropriate policy responses are very important, both when the economy has some
fundamental imbalances, as in the early to mid-1980s, but also when the economy goes into
the difficulties from a much stronger starting point, as in the early 2000s.2 The more recent

18.
In particular good coordination of fiscal and monetary policies have proven to
be crucial. A good illustration is the policies in the first half of 2002. As a response to the
economic troubles caused by the two shocks from the dot-com boom and the Intifada, fiscal
policy was set to be restrained while monetary policy would be considerably loosened.
Instead, as policies were implemented, both the fiscal and the monetary policy stance were
expansive, which soon led to a significant loss of credibility and pressure on the exchange
rate and financial stability.
19.
In both periods, concerns about high and increasing levels of public debt
constrained policy options. Policies that made fiscal sustainability come into question, led
to pressures in the balance of payments and on the exchange rate. To restore confidence,
policy adjustments were important, but U.S. support, in the form of aid or debt guarantees,
was also key.
Policy Issues
20.
Israel’s external vulnerabilities and the continuation of the global economic
crises present major policy challenges.
•

How can fiscal policy flexibility and credibility be balanced?

In an economic downturn, a countercyclical policy stance is appropriate and there may be a
need for extraordinary measures, e.g. to support the financial sector. At the same time, as past
experiences demonstrate, fiscal policies must be credible in containing public debt over the
medium-term.

56
•

How large should foreign exchange reserves be – and when should they be used?

Sizeable foreign exchange reserves can instill confidence in the exchange rate market and
provide liquidity for external financial transactions. There are, however, opportunity costs for
holding and accumulating reserves, and they must be used appropriately.
•
Should financial sector stress be addressed preemptively, or should the government
resist intervention and then manage the consequences?
Government interventions in the financial sector are costly and will likely distort incentives,
but in the absence of government intervention the consequences of a financial crises can be
overwhelming.
•

What is the right monetary policy stance?

Past experiences show that policy coordination is critical, and monetary policy must be
calibrated to be consistent with fiscal and financial sector policies, which is challenging in
the current uncertain economic and political environment.
Assessment of these issues is presented in the main text of the Staff report.

ATTACHMENT IV: FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY
Baseline scenario
With the primary balance projected to continue strengthening in the baseline scenario (with
adherence to the 1.7 percent ceiling on real expenditure growth), Israel’s fiscal vulnerability
is expected to fall broadly. After the cyclical downturns expected for 2009-2010, gross
financing need drops from 13¾ percent of GDP in 2010 to 8¾ percent in 2013, thus
lowering rollover risks (and the associated risks of run on the shekel) over time. And public
debt is firmly put on a downward path, reduced to 74 percent of GDP in 2013 (chart 1).
External risks
Risk aversion
External financial developments constitute key risks to the baseline projection. For instance,
should the ongoing dislocation in the international financial system prove to be deeper and
more protracted than expected, global risk appetite would be eroded further. In such a
scenario, even if domestic factors (e.g., output growth and policies) evolve as projected,
investors may demand higher yields or shed their holdings in shekel-denominated assets, thus
impacting the real interest rates and/or the exchange rate.
•
A permanent ½ standard-deviation shock to the interest rate—a 1.4 percentage point
increase from the baseline—would dampen the pace of debt reduction and bring public debt
to 80 percent of GDP in 2013 (chart 2).
•
A one-time 30 percent depreciation in the REER (in 2009) would immediately
increase public debt to 92¾ percent of GDP upon impact, reflecting a significant portion of
the government’s liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Debt would subsequently fall
at a pace envisaged in the baseline, but still stand at 86 percent of GDP in 2013 (chart 6).
Costly interventions
The spreading global financial turmoil may also directly undermine the functioning of the
domestic financial sector, thus potentially necessitating costly government interventions.
•
A one-time 10 percent of GDP shock to contingent liabilities (in 2009) would
increase public debt to 91 percent of GDP. Assuming the baseline case of speed of debt
reduction thereafter, public debt would be 85 percent of GDP 2013 (chart 6).

58
Domestic risks
Fiscal indiscipline
Given the back-loaded nature of deficit improvement in the baseline, the projected debt
reduction is premised on sustained commitment to fiscal strengthening.
•
A ½ standard deviation shock to primary balance—lowering average primary balance
to 0.7 percent of GDP during the forecast period—would imply a more gradual debt
reduction and increase debt by 4 percentage points of GDP (to 78 percent) in 2013 relative to
the baseline (chart 4).
Growth slowdown
Lower-than-expected output growth could also significantly strain fiscal sustainability—as
demonstrated during the 2001–03 economic downturn when public debt ballooned by
15 percentage points to 100 percent of GDP.
•
A ½ standard deviation shock to growth would bring average projected annual growth
down by more than half to 1.5 percent. Even with no fiscal loosening (i.e., no decrease in
primary balance from the baseline), public debt would rise to 93 percent of GDP in 2013 due
to adverse debt dynamics (chart 3).
But in more realistic scenarios featuring growth shocks, the government would likely engage
in structural fiscal easing. Moreover, if there are also increased concerns about Israel’s longterm economic prospects, sovereign spreads would likely rise. Such a confluence of shocks—
lower growth, higher real interest rates and weaker primary balance—would pose threats to
the debt reduction plan.
•
One-quarter standard deviation shocks to growth, real interest rate, and primary
balance (i.e., lowering average annual growth to 2½ percent, raising real interest rate to
5¼ percent, and reducing the primary balance to 1¼ percent of GDP) would bring public
debt to 83 percent of GDP in 2013—an increase of 9 percentage points of GDP from the
baseline (chart 5).

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
As of June 9, 2005 Israel’s exchange rate regime is officially classified as floating.
This step by the Government of Israel was taken to remove the last vestige of a policy
in which the exchange rate of the NIS fluctuated within the limits of a crawling band.
In practice, however, the NIS has been floating since 1997, when the Bank of Israel
stopped intervening to protect the band.

intensified, with a focus on the macroeconomic, fiscal, and financial areas. Three staff
missions to the WBG took place in 2008—in March, June and November—to assist the
Palestinian authorities in developing and updating their medium-term macroeconomic and
fiscal frameworks in line with the broad objectives laid out in the Palestinian Reform and
Development Plan (PRDP) presented at the Paris international donors' conference in
December 2007. Looking forward, the Fund will be regularly reporting to donors on the
macroeconomic and fiscal situation, and on the implementation of public finance reforms.
Technical assistance will be stepped up in the areas of public expenditure management,
banking supervision and regulation, and macroeconomic statistics.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with Israel
On February 13, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Israel. 1
Background
The economy grew rapidly following the 2001–03 downturn. Real GDP growth averaged over
5 percent in 2004–07, as strong export of goods and services spurred private consumption and
investment. In this context, the current account remained in strong surplus.
Fiscal and monetary policies reflected and supported strong and stable growth. The central
government fiscal accounts steadily improved from a deficit of 5.4 percent of GDP in 2003 to
balance in 2007, and public debt was lowered from 100 percent of GDP to under 80 percent of
GDP during 2003–07. Inflation climbed steadily after mid-2007, surpassing the upper bound
(3 percent) of the inflation target in December 2007. In response, the Bank of Israel (BoI) raised
policy rates by 75 basis points between August 2007 and February 2008, to 4¼ percent.
External economic vulnerabilities are contained, with gross debt assets exceeding gross debt
liabilities in the short term and overall. In the context of strong capital inflows—reflected in a
15 percent real appreciation of the shekel since mid-2007 back to its long run level—the
authorities implemented a pre-announced program of reserve accumulation to attenuate
external vulnerabilities further.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
Trends changed in the Fall of 2008 as the deterioration of global financial conditions and the
weakening of export markets took their toll. Exports and growth slowed, lowering the annual
external current account surplus to 1¼ percent of GDP, and reducing growth to some
4¼ percent for the year. Alongside, fiscal revenue fell short in the fourth quarter, raising the
central government deficit to 2.1 percent of GDP in 2008, with public debt at about 77½ percent
of GDP. In this context, with the prospective global growth slowdown reversing earlier food and
energy price inflation and associated inflation expectations, the BoI rapidly reduced policy
rates—to 1 percent in February 2009. Inflation fell to 3.3 percent in January 2009 from the high
of 5.5 percent in September 2008.
Israel’s banking sector appears robust with interbank liquidity undisturbed. But, as globally,
equity and domestic corporate bond markets weakened in 2008. Several measures to relieve
credit strains have been announced, including the establishment of public-private corporate
bond funds and expanding guarantees for credits to small and medium enterprises.
As the global crisis continues to unfold, activity is set to decelerate further, with inflationary
pressures easing significantly alongside. And with fiscal revenues weakening in this context,
fiscal deficits and public debt are set to rise.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the robust and balanced economic growth since 2003,
underpinned by sound macroeconomic policies, and supported by a stable banking sector and
favorable global conditions. Directors noted, however, that global strains and weakness in the
corporate bond market weigh on credit and growth prospects, and accordingly, activity is set to
slow markedly in 2009–10. Thus, significant economic challenges lie ahead, with the high level
of public debt remaining a vulnerability.
Directors underscored that the immediate policy priority is to support credit flows, combined with
contingency planning for tail events. In this context, they welcomed the recently announced
plans to establish public-private funds to purchase corporate bonds, and recommended that
these funds focus their activities on bond refinancing and new bond issues from solvent firms, in
order to maximize the impact on credit flows to firms. Clearly defined terms of reference would
ensure transparency and accountability.
While acknowledging the resilience of the banking sector to date, Directors called for a careful
review of the legal procedures governing public interventions in, and assistance for, banks, with
a view to ensuring adequate capacity to deal with any systemic stress in banks. Reform of the
supervisory organizational structures and the introduction of an explicit deposit insurance
scheme should remain under consideration, with the aim of implementing them once the current
crisis has eased. Directors welcomed steps to enhance information-sharing and cooperation
among the regulatory agencies, and encouraged further efforts to strengthen the supervision of
the rapidly growing nonbank financial sector.

3
Directors commended the authorities for their disciplined budget execution in recent years,
which had delivered strong budget outturns, secured significant debt reduction, and accordingly
prepared fiscal policy for a supportive role in the current circumstances. In the near term, they
agreed that automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate fully, and welcomed efforts to
bring forward planned infrastructure projects. While leaving the underlying structural fiscal
balance close to its 2008 outturn, this would require a relaxation of the budget deficit ceiling.
However, in light of the potential fiscal risks from the financial sector, the still-high debt ratio,
and the need to maintain room for further fiscal maneuver if the economic outlook deteriorates
further, Directors cautioned against further relaxation at this stage.
Directors emphasized the need to strengthen further the medium-term fiscal framework,
anchored by a medium-term public debt goal and associated expenditure ceilings. The specifics
of such a framework should balance the need for flexibility, given the uncertain global
environment, with the need for sufficiently firm mechanisms to guide the political process. A
debt objective defined over the medium term, supported by rolling multi-year ceilings on nominal
annual spending, could strike this balance appropriately, although some Directors also saw
merit in an automatic error correction mechanism and caps on real expenditures.
Noting that inflation is expected to fall sharply, Directors supported the recent decisive
reductions in policy rates to forestall the risk of a protracted undershooting of the inflation target.
There remains some room for further monetary easing, given the prospect of low inflation
expectations and the constrained fiscal space. In this regard, Directors stressed the need for
close monitoring of key indicators to ensure a timely response and maintain market confidence.
Directors agreed that inflation targeting and the flexible exchange rate regime have served the
Israeli economy well, and they welcomed steps to reinforce these frameworks, supported by
effective communication. Directors commended the authorities for the pre-announced
accumulation of reserves, which bolsters credibility while abjuring discretionary intervention.
Directors also welcomed the proposed new draft Bank of Israel Law, which aims to strengthen
the governance of the monetary policy decision-making process.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat

debt when it matures and is recorded below the line in the central government balance, but above the line in the general government balance when it
accrues.

Israel's Macroeconomic Developments and Outlook
The Israeli authorities would like to thank staff for fruitful discussions in Jerusalem. The
authorities share the staff’s views on the economy and broadly agree with its appraisal.
The Israeli economy performed strongly over the last five years, owing to favorable global
economic conditions and prudent macroeconomic policies, placing Israel in a relatively good
position, even as it is being hit by the global crisis. Overall economic activity expanded
rapidly, the labor participation rate continued to rise, and the current account has been in
surplus indicating healthy growth and sustainable macroeconomic policies.
In 2008, fiscal discipline was maintained, allowing for a further reduction in the relative size
of the public sector and in the public debt-to-GDP ratio. Monetary policy adjusted swiftly to
the changing environment as the authorities increased the interest rate in the middle of the
year when imported inflation pushed prices upward. Then, soon after the start of the fourth
quarter, the interest rate was rapidly reduced to unprecedented low levels, in response to the
deepening of the global crisis and expected recession.
Israel’s net International Investment Position (IIP) is almost balanced, reflecting net negative
capital assets (27 percent of GDP) and net positive debt assets (23 percent of GDP). This
structure of IIP is a result of large FDI and foreign portfolio investments in the last decade,
current account surpluses in the last six years, and investment in debt assets abroad by
residents. Israel’s IIP structure and current account surplus reduce the vulnerability of the
economy to a rollover risk and ‘sudden stop.’
As a small open economy with exports exceeding 40 percent of GDP, Israel is not immune to
the global crisis and the authorities are well aware of the challenges ahead. In the short term,
this means mitigating the tight credit conditions and supporting domestic demand, and in the
longer term, maintaining a sustainable fiscal policy, directed at lowering the public debt-toGDP ratio and supporting growth.
The fall in the composite state-of-the-economy index1 in the last few months of 2008, as well
as the decline in goods' exports, indicates the severity of the slowdown in economic activity
in the last quarter of 2008 and the strong effect of global demand on the Israeli economy.
1

The composite state-of-the-economy index is a synthetic cyclical indicator for examining the direction in
which real economic activity is moving, in real time. It is calculated from the monthly changes of six
components: manufacturing production index; imports, excluding capital goods; trade and services revenue; the
number of employee posts in the business sector; manufactured goods exports; and export of services.

2
Data from the Bank of Israel Companies Survey is also indicating a severe slowdown that
encompasses all industries, with manufacturing exports recording the most notable decline in
activity.
Recently, the Bank of Israel published its macroeconomic forecast for 2009 and, like the
staff, significantly revised down its estimates. However, the central bank is somewhat more
pessimistic than staff, projecting that GDP will contract by 0.2 percent, private consumption
growth will decelerate to 1.1 percent, and exports will fall sharply, by almost 7 percent. The
central government deficit is projected to reach 4.1 percent and unemployment to increase to
an average level of 7.6 percent. With regards to 2010, the central bank forecasts a growth rate
of 2.7 percent, which coincides with staff’s projection.
In 2008, the real effective exchange rate appreciated by almost 12 percent. A possible
explanation for this substantial appreciation is the difference in timing and intensity with
which the global crisis struck the economy, affecting the nominal and real exchange rate. The
Bank of Israel assesses that the real effective exchange rate in the third quarter of 2008 was
overvalued by 4 to 10 percent. However, as it became clear since the fourth quarter, that the
Israeli economy will be substantially affected by the global recession, the shekel (NIS)
depreciated somewhat.
Fiscal Policy
In 2008, the authorities continued with their long-term strategy of fiscal consolidation and
contraction of the public debt-to-GDP ratio, by restraining expenditure and maintaining the
multi-year program of lowering direct taxes. The public debt-to-GDP ratio reached 78.2
percent, 1.5 percentage points lower than in 2007, and around twenty-five percentage points
lower than in 1998.
The political environment in Israel is complex, against the background of the global financial
crisis. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert resigned in September; his successor as the head of the
Kadima Party, Tzipi Livni did not succeed in forming a new government, prompting general
elections held on Tuesday, February 10. The 2009 budget will only be approved by the
Knesset after a new government is formed.
Meanwhile, the Israeli authorities put together a fiscal stimulus plan, aimed at mitigating
tighter credit conditions (domestic and external) and the effects of lower external demand––
the two main channels through which the global financial turmoil hit the economy. The main
building blocks of the fiscal stimulus plan are: establishing public-private funds to recycle
corporate bonds, providing government guarantees for capital raised by banks, guaranteeing
credit to SMEs, providing a safety-net for long-term investors close to retirement and
increasing investments in infrastructure and R&D.
The authorities are aware that it is essential for the fiscal stimulus plan to be appropriate to
the medium- and long-term targets and constraints. It is of utmost importance that such steps

3
do not result in an excessive increase of the government deficit or government debt.
Therefore, the authorities allocated only a small amount of the stimulus plan to increase
domestic demand directly.
The sharp economic downturn has already caused a drop in tax revenues, resulting in a
shortfall of NIS 6.5 billion in budget revenues in 2008 compared with the forecast. However,
the credibility acquired by fiscal policy allows a moderate short-term increase in the fiscal
deficit, which is not likely to undermine economic stability or impair confidence in fiscal
policy. It is expected that the 2009 budget, which will be approved soon after a new
government is formed, will include a one-off increase in security spending because of the
recent conflict with Hamas, as well as an adjustment for credit allocated through the abovementioned programs.
The discussion of Israel's fiscal policy, and staff's suggestions for a revised fiscal rule, are
broadly appropriate given the current crisis and Israel's structural fiscal position. In light of
the expected cyclical increase in the deficit, the need to retain fiscal credibility via a mediumterm fiscal rule, like a reduction in debt-to-GDP ratio below 60 percent early in the second
half of the next decade, is clear. Although the specific depiction of the rule may take various
forms, its essence - replacement of the current expenditure ceiling with a more flexible one is appropriate. A detailed plan specifying the required measures to meet the medium-term
targets, as proposed by staff, will increase its credibility.
Monetary policy
In 2008, monetary policy was adjusted swiftly to the changing economic environment. At the
beginning of the year, the expected decline in economic growth and inflation spurred a
change in monetary policy. As a result, the Bank of Israel had reduced its key policy interest
rate as early as March. In the second and third quarters, inflation rose well above its target
range2, due primarily to the continued increases in world raw material prices, while the
economy was still buoyant; and therefore the Bank of Israel increased its policy rate. The
rapid and serious deterioration of the global economy from mid-September necessitated deep
interest rate cuts, similar to steps taken by other central banks. Inflation was expected to fall
sharply, and the Bank of Israel reduced its interest rate from 4.25 percent at the beginning of
the fourth quarter to 1 percent in February 2009, its lowest level ever.
The objective of these interest rate cuts is to support real economic activity and limit any
deviation of inflation below target, in light of the severe drop in demand and the fall in
commodity prices. Inflation expectations for the next twelve months derived from the capital
market (break-even inflation) were 0.5 percent in January. Israeli private forecasters predict

The inflation target in Israel is defined as a rise of 1–3 percent in the CPI measured over the previous twelve
months.

4
on average twelve-month inflation at about the same level. The Bank of Israel’s econometric
models also show that there is a high probability that inflation in 2009 will be below the
target range.
In March 2008 the Bank of Israel announced a plan to increase foreign exchange reserves by
purchasing a fixed daily amount ($25 million) of foreign currency in the open market. The
idea of increasing the foreign exchange reserves had been around for several years, with the
intention of enhancing Israel’s resilience to domestic and external shocks. Comfortable
market conditions persuaded the central bank to start executing its plan in 2008. In July, as
the nominal effective exchange rate appreciated further, the Bank of Israel increased the daily
amount of foreign currency bought in the market to US$100 million. In retrospect, the
decision to implement the plan to increase the international reserves was timely,
strengthening confidence and reducing financial vulnerability in the face of possible
additional shocks.
As a result of the appreciation of the shekel against the US dollar in 2007 and 2008, a trend
emerged away from indexation of housing prices to the US dollar. At the beginning of 2009
only a small percentage of housing contracts was still indexed to the US dollar, reducing
significantly the pass-through from the exchange rate to inflation. Although this structural
break makes the monetary transmission mechanism more complicated, it may reduce
inflation volatility and thus increase the central bank’s credibility in subsequent years. It may
also enable the central bank to react more actively to real shocks to the economy within the
IT regime.
Financial Sector
The Israeli banking system has been only mildly affected by the world financial turmoil
because of its conservative approach to risk and due to comprehensive regulation and close
supervision. The banking system and each bank individually were depending neither on
wholesale markets nor on credit lines from abroad, as their short-term external debt is more
than matched by deposits abroad and the mortgage banks were not depending on capital
markets for their funding needs. However, with other sectors of the economy becoming
affected by the global recession, the banks will likely have to increase provisioning for bad
loans. Furthermore, the banks also incurred losses on their holdings of minority interests in
non-financial companies, since these companies were hurt by the crisis.
The banks are aware that in spite of the difficulties they have to adhere to their early business
plans of raising capital adequacy to 12 percent by the end of 2009. The government plan to
provide guarantees of NIS 6 billion for capital raised by banks might make this task easier
and reinforce their robustness.
Israel’s financial system has undergone rapid reform-driven change. The non-banking
financial sector increased significantly, reaching a share of almost 50 percent of the business
sector’s outstanding credit. The reform has generated significant challenges for supervisors

5
as risks have shifted from the banking sector to the non-banking financial institutions, and
regulation has not yet been harmonized. These challenges intensified once the global
financial crisis erupted.
The three regulators – Banking Supervision, Capital Markets Insurance and Savings
Division, and Israel Securities Authority – are jointly preparing and implementing various
action plans to combat the slowdown and to enhance preparedness for contingencies in the
context of stresses in financial markets. The three regulators participate in various joint highlevel committees; their staff participates in joint sub-committees and working teams. The
Supervisor of Banks has intensified monitoring of banks exposures, enhanced regulatory
requirements regarding, inter alia, banks’ review of their business strategy and risk
management policies, including control over their subsidiaries and branches abroad, and
banks' public disclosure.
In October 2007, the EU Commission (Moneyval) examined whether Israel complies with
the 49 recommendations of the FATF. In August 2008, it published a report which found that
Israel is compliant or largely compliant with the majority of these recommendations. Israel is
amending legislation and regulations, and strengthening enforcement in order to implement
all recommendations of the report by the time it will be discussed by the EU Commission in
July 2009.
