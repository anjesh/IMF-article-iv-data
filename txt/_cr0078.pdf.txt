IMF Staff Country Report No. 00/78

Republic of Latvia : Staff Report for the 2000 Article IV Consultation and
First Review Under the Stand-By Arrangement
As required under Article IV of its Articles of Agreement, the International Monetary Fund conducts
periodic consultations with its member countries. In the context of the 2000 Article IV consultation with
Republic of Latvia, the following documents have been released and are included in this package:
•

the staff report for the 2000 Article IV consultation, prepared by a staff team of the IMF, following
discussions that ended on May 5, 2000, with the officials of Republic of Latvia on economic
developments and policies. Based on information available at the time of these discussions, the
staff report was completed on June 15, 2000. The views expressed in the staff report are those of
the staff team and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Executive Board of the IMF;

•

a staff statement of June 28, 2000, updating information on recent economic developments;

•

the Public Information Notice (PIN), which summarizes the views of the Executive Board as
expressed during the June 30, 2000, Executive Board discussion of the staff report that concluded
the Article IV consultation;

•

a statement by the authorities of Republic of Latvia.

Further background documentation prepared by IMF staff for the consultation may be published separately
at a later date. The policy of publication of Article IV staff reports and PINS allows for the deletion of
market-sensitive information.
The Article IV staff report is published—both in hard copy and on the IMF's website
(http://www.imf.org)—as part of a pilot project. To assist the IMF in evaluating the pilot project
for release of Article IV staff reports, reader comments are invited prior to October 5, 2000, and
may be sent by e-mail to Pilotproject@imf.org.
