IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Norway
On June 29, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Norway.
The declines in oil prices and offshore investment have taken a toll on the Norwegian mainland
economy: growth fell to 1 percent in 2015—the lowest level since the global financial crisis. The
drag from private investment was offset by continued growth in household consumption,
expansionary fiscal policy and a boost to traditional goods exports, aided by the weak krone.
Unemployment has increased to 4.7 percent as of March 2016, with the rise mainly concentrated
in oil-dependent regions. Core inflation reached 3.3 percent in April 2016 after peaking at 3.4 in
February, above the 2.5 percent target, largely due to the effect of exchange rate depreciation on
imported consumer goods prices. House price inflation accelerated recently after the slowdown
throughout 2015, albeit with large regional variation, and household debt remains elevated at
220 percent of disposable income. Banks remain profitable and are well-positioned to meet
regulatory capital requirements.
The 2015 structural non-oil deficit was 2.6 percent of the Government Pension Fund Global
(GPFG) assets, equivalent to 6.25 percent of mainland trend GDP. This provided a fiscal impulse
of .5 percent of mainland trend GDP. The structural non-oil deficit remains well below the 4
percent of GPFG assets that the fiscal rule targets, in part as the exchange rate depreciation

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

contributed to a substantial increase in GPFG assets measured in Norwegian krone. The revised
2016 budget envisions a rise in the structural non-oil deficit to 7½ percent of mainland trend
GDP (2.8 percent of GPFG assets), which will provide a fiscal impulse of 1.1 percent of
mainland trend GDP.
Economic activity is set to remain sluggish this year, with mainland GDP growth of 1.1 percent,
supported by public sector demand and mainland exports, while private domestic demand is set
to remain depressed. A recovery should take root in 2017 alongside a gradual upturn in oil prices
and a slowing of the pace of decline in oil investment. As the oil-related parts of the mainland
economy adjust to lower demand, unemployment is projected to rise further this year before
declining in 2017. Headline inflation is projected to be 2.8 percent this year and is expected to
return to the 2.5 percent target next year as low capacity utilization weighs on domestic inflation
and the effect of the exchange rate depreciation abates.
Downside risks predominate. Lower than expected growth in key advanced and emerging
economies would have negative implications for oil prices and traditional exports. Combined
with a sharp property price correction, this would weigh on consumption and domestic firms,
especially those in the retail and construction sectors. Similarly, a delay in the transition to a less
oil dependent economy could lead to higher unemployment for longer, thereby weakening
confidence and consumption. In a downturn, a rise in defaults on corporate loans would in turn
put pressure on banks’ balance sheets. In addition, tighter or more volatile global financial
conditions could raise financing costs of Norwegian banks that are reliant on wholesale funding.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted that the Norwegian economy has suffered from the decline in oil
prices, while the influx of refugees presents new challenges. A modest recovery is expected to
take root next year, subject to downside risks, including weaker global growth and persistently
lower oil prices. The broadly positive medium-term outlook hinges on a successful transition

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summing up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

away from oil dependence. Directors concurred that supportive macroeconomic policies and
steadfast structural reforms to boost productivity and cost competitiveness would be necessary to
facilitate this transition and place growth on a stronger footing.
Directors considered that the expansionary stance of fiscal policy this year is broadly
appropriate, given the output gap, rising unemployment, and the ample fiscal space. They
stressed the need for well-targeted temporary measures that also promote rebalancing the
economy toward non-oil tradable sectors. Directors recommended a gradual shift to a more
neutral fiscal stance as the economy returns to potential. They supported recent reforms to shift
from personal and corporate income taxation to promote productive investment. Directors
welcomed the ongoing review of the fiscal rule, aimed at ensuring continued prudent
management of the country’s oil wealth, taking into account the interests of future generations.
Directors agreed that, given the slack in the economy and well-anchored inflation expectations,
monetary policy should remain accommodative until there are firm signs of durable recovery. In
this regard, they welcomed the authorities’ readiness to reduce the policy rate further if
warranted. Directors acknowledged the challenge of balancing the need to support economic
growth against the risk of inflation from a further exchange rate depreciation and financial
stability concerns from rising house prices. They recommended that the authorities continue
monitoring the development of household debt and house prices, and promptly tighten
macroprudential measures to address emerging financial stability risks.
Directors observed that banking sector performance remains relatively strong, and welcomed the
significant progress in implementing the recommendations of the Financial Sector Assessment
Program. They encouraged further efforts to mitigate systemic risks that might arise from high
household indebtedness and banks’ reliance on external wholesale funding, including by further
strengthening the framework for crisis management and resolution, as well as regional
cooperation.
Directors emphasized the need for continuing structural reforms to support a successful transition
and improve the efficiency of the economy. They saw merit in continued restraint in wage
settlements and further reforms to reinvigorate productivity growth. Aligning public sector

4
pensions with recent private sector reforms and reforms to sickness and disability pensions could
increase labor force participation. Directors also saw scope for efficiency gains from reducing
tax preferences for owner-occupied housing and relaxing supply restrictions in the housing
market.
Directors commended the Norwegian government for its noteworthy efforts to absorb the
increased number of refugees. They noted that further efforts to accelerate the integration of the
newly arrived refugees into productive employment would help reduce fiscal costs and raise
output.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 9, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context: It is a challenging time. The fall in oil prices has taken a toll on the mainland
(i.e. non-oil and gas) economy, with growth falling to 1 percent in 2015 and rising
unemployment. At the same time, the recent rise in the number of asylum seekers
presents new challenges.
Fiscal policy: The fiscal stimulus planned for 2016 is justifiable, given the significant
output gap, rising unemployment, and the ample fiscal space. Nevertheless, the
composition of fiscal policy needs to avoid inhibiting the shift of resources to non-oil
tradable industries. As the economy gathers steam, the authorities should move towards
a neutral fiscal stance.
Monetary policy: Monetary policy should stay accommodative given weak growth and
the stable inflation outlook. While inflation expectations are currently well-anchored,
there is a risk that exchange rate-driven imported inflation could spill over to domestic
inflation. Financial stability concerns should for now be addressed primarily through
macroprudential and other measures.
Financial sector policy: While substantial progress has been made to address risks in
the financial sector, staff encouraged the authorities to implement additional measures
recommended by last year’s FSAP Update to further mitigate systemic risks.
Structural policy: Wage restraint and labor market policies play key roles in improving
cost competitiveness, as well as in integrating the extra inflows of asylum seekers into
productive employment.

CONTEXT: AN OIL ECONOMY IN TRANSITION

Growth has continued to slow in the mainland economy. At the start of this year, oil
prices had dropped by roughly 60 percent from their peak in June 2014 to less than US$40 per
barrel. The adverse terms of trade movement has

dependent sectors (e.g., oil services) and the rest
of the economy, with the former largely driving the slowdown in economic activity (Figure 1).
2.
The labor market is feeling the sting of
the oil price crash. The seasonally-adjusted Labor
Force Survey (LFS) unemployment rate reached
4.7 percent in March—the highest level in ten
years. Rising unemployment is mainly driven by
strong labor force growth, but employment
started to falter in the fourth quarter (Figure 2).
Unemployment is increasingly concentrated in oildependent parts of the country (e.g., Rogaland),
while remaining stable or even falling in other
parts.

Headline and core inflation have recently risen above the 2.5 percent target. Core
inflation was 2.7 percent on average last year but it reached 3.3 percent in April after peaking at
3.4 percent in February, largely due to the effect of exchange rate depreciation on imported goods
prices.2 Meanwhile, wage growth—2.8 percent last year—has been subdued and inflation
expectations are stable (Figure 3).

15/250, respectively), and Technical Note on Bank Stress Testing for the 2015 FSAP Update (IMF Country Report No.

The krone has weakened substantially in parallel with the decline in oil prices. The
import-weighted nominal exchange rate has depreciated by about 25 percent since early 2013, and
the krone is assessed to be moderately undervalued relative to economic fundamentals and
desirable policies (Annex I). The competitive exchange rate has helped reverse some of the longterm deterioration in Norway’s unit labor cost (ULC) measured in common currency, boosting
exports of traditional goods. Yet, the current account surplus narrowed in 2015, almost entirely due
to the fall in the value of oil and gas exports (Figure 4).

5.
House price inflation accelerated
recently after the slowdown throughout 2015,
but with significant regional variation. House
prices increased by 6.1 percent last year, but the
pace tapered throughout the year in line with
slowing income growth. The national figure masks
wide regional variation, with prices rising robustly
in the Oslo area while declining in areas most
affected by falling oil prices (e.g., Stavanger).
Household debt as a share of disposable income is
largely unchanged at about 220 percent in mid2015 (Figure 5).
6.
There was a surge in asylum seekers late last year (Annex III). Norway received over
27,000 first-time asylum applicants between June and December last year—almost four times as
many for the same period in 2014. This brought the total number of applicants for the entire year to
over 31,000 (0.6 percent of the population), a third of whom came from Syria. The government
expects a slightly lower inflow in 2016 of about 25,000, although with a very large degree of
uncertainty, and proposed a broadly budget-neutral increase in spending of about 0.4 percent of
mainland GDP to handle the extra inflows of asylum seekers.

OUTLOOK: GRADUAL RECOVERY CLOUDED BY RISKS
7.
A modest recovery should take root next year. Mainland economy growth should be
about 1 percent this year and pick up to close to 1¾ percent in 2017. Private consumption and
investment are expected to remain slow this year, but offset by higher public sector demand and
mainland exports. Expansionary fiscal and monetary policy, the lagged impact of the weak krone, a
gradual upturn in oil prices, and a slowing of the pace of decline in oil investment are expected to
support the recovery. Unemployment is projected to rise further this year to 4.7 percent before
declining to 4.5 percent in 2017. Headline inflation is expected to stay above the 2.5 percent target
at 2¾ percent this year, but should return to target next year as low capacity utilization weighs on
domestic inflation and the effect of exchange rate depreciation wears off.

Medium-term growth hinges on a successful transition away from oil dependence.
Even before the plunge in oil prices, investment on the Norwegian continental shelf had been
expected to trend downward. At the same time, the mainland economy has grown increasingly
dependent on offshore demand, with about one

Risks are skewed to the downside (Risk Assessment Matrix, Box 1).



A sharper-than-expected global growth slowdown or persistently lower oil prices could
derail the projected recovery. Slower growth in key advanced and emerging economies could
hinder the recovery of non-oil-related exports, or put further downward pressures on oil prices.
Persistently lower-than-projected oil prices could intensify the fall in oil investment and take
further toll on oil-related demand for mainland goods and services, with adverse spillover effects
on confidence and consumption in the rest of the economy.



A substantial correction in property prices could depress private demand and reduce
output. A large fall in house prices―caused by further negative shocks to the oil and gas sector,
interest rate hikes, or a significant change in sentiment―could result in an abrupt reduction in
consumption and residential investment with ripple effects on corporate earnings and banks.
The staff’s analysis suggests that a 10 percent decline in real house prices could reduce private
consumption by 0.9 percent.4 However, the probability of a sharp increase in the mortgage
default rate is low and risks to financial stability are contained, as concluded by the 2015 FSAP
Update.5



Tighter or more volatile global financial conditions could lead to liquidity strains and raise
costs for Norwegian banks that rely on wholesale funding. A bumpy QE exit in the United
States, a British exit from the EU with potential widespread contagion, or Euro Area turbulence
could raise volatility and wholesale funding costs.

The full-recourse nature of Norwegian mortgages and the ample social safety net has accounted for limited credit
risks on household loans, as households have incentives to or are enabled to make payments.



A hesitant or even stalled transition to a growth model less dependent on the oil and gas
sector could lead to higher unemployment for a longer period, with adverse consequences
for income and consumption. If wages fail to adjust quickly or resources fail to move from oilrelated sectors to non-oil tradable sectors efficiently, the expected pick-up in non-oil parts of
the economy may not be enough to absorb the slack caused by lower oil prices.

The increased number of refugees, if not effectively integrated into the labor market,
could weigh on the public finances and raise structural unemployment.

10.
Downside risks could interact. For example, persistently low oil prices could trigger a sharp
correction in house prices through its deleterious impact on growth, employment, and consumer
confidence. A housing market hard landing would in turn prolong the transition through negative
wealth effects reducing household consumption and business demand, as well as through its
potential implications for banking sector performance and credit supply. Protracted weakness in
global growth could also slow the transition by dampening external demand for Norway’s traditional
goods exports, thereby depressing business investment and job creation.

Authorities’ Views
11.
The authorities generally agreed with staff’s assessment of the outlook and risks. They
noted the large regional variation in labor and housing market developments, reflecting, in part,
different levels of dependence on oil and gas within Norway. They noted that lower consumer
confidence may translate into lower consumption growth than expected, and high household debt
can be a challenge if unemployment increases. However, they also pointed to shock absorbers,
including supportive macroeconomic policies, the sound fiscal framework, the weaker exchange
rate, flexible labor force, and the solid financial positions of Norwegian banks and households. On
the risk of a British exit, the main direct links to the U.K. are in trade; banking system linkages are
mostly to the euro area (long-term) and the U.S. (short-term). The authorities saw small direct
impact on the Norwegian economy in a British exit scenario if a bilateral trade agreement can be put
into place quickly and financial market disruptions do not severely affect euro area and U.S. financial
markets.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
12.
Economic policies should aim to mitigate the downturn while facilitating the transition
and strengthening the economy’s productive capacity and resilience to shocks.
Macroeconomic policies should work together to support growth and employment, while preparing
the economy for a “new normal” by smoothing the transition to a less oil-dependent growth model.
Labor market policies will play a key role in fostering external competitiveness and integrating
refugees into productive employment. Also, further measures are needed to mitigate risks in the
financial sector.

Fiscal policy was supportive last year
with a fiscal impulse of ½ percent of
mainland trend GDP. The structural non-oil
budget deficit amounted to about 6¼ percent of
mainland trend GDP. This is equivalent to
2.6 percent of Government Pension Fund Global
(GPFG) assets at year-end—well below the
4 percent “target” of the fiscal rule. GPFG assets
have been growing rapidly in recent years, in
large part due to the depreciation of the
currency, which raises the krone value of foreign
currency denominated assets.

14.
The authorities are expecting a 1.1 percent fiscal impulse this year. The revised 2016

2.8 percent of staff’s projected GPFG assets at year end. An additional 0.4 percent of mainland GDP

15.
The 2016 budget includes a package of special employment-enhancing measures and
tax reductions. Special measures amounting to NOK 4 billion (nearly 0.2 percent of mainland GDP)
aim to create jobs in areas and sectors particularly affected by the downturn. The revised budget
introduced new, targeted measures worth NOK 900 million (0.04 percent of mainland GDP) to
support employment in southern and western Norway. As part of the government’s tax reform
proposal covering the 2016–18 period, net tax reductions worth NOK 8.3 billion (0.3 percent of
mainland GDP) would be implemented this year, including a reduction of the statutory corporate
income tax (CIT) rate from 27 to 25 percent and a reduction of the top marginal tax rate on personal
income by 0.3 percentage points. The CIT rate would be reduced further to 23 percent by 2018.
16.
The expansionary fiscal stance this year is justifiable. Staff views the level of fiscal
stimulus planned this year as appropriate given the widening output gap (estimated by staff
at -1.4 percent), rising unemployment, the ample fiscal space, and low risk to debt sustainability (see
Annex II). The fiscal support would also complement monetary policy efforts at a time when there is
arguably less monetary policy space, given that the key policy rate is approaching zero (see
Section B).
17.
The composition of fiscal policy should strike a balance between counteracting the
downturn and facilitating the necessary economic adjustment. The proposed tax reductions,
would promote private saving and investment and an efficient allocation of resources, while
bringing Norway’s tax system closer to international best practice. Public expenditure aimed at
boosting the economy’s productive capacity and external competitiveness would be conducive to
the ongoing transition. On the other hand, public spending should avoid interrupting the shift of
resources and employment to non-oil tradable production by increasing public employment or
increasing expenditures on domestic goods and services.
18.
As economic growth gathers steam, the fiscal stance should gradually shift to neutral
to relieve so-called “Dutch Disease” pressures. Fiscal policy in Norway has generally been

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NORWAY

prudent, with spending of oil revenues well below 4 percent of GPFG assets in recent years.
Nevertheless, as the size of the fund has been growing much faster than mainland GDP, the fiscal
rule’s 4 percent target is no longer appropriate as a short-term operational guidance for fiscal
policy, and a target more like the current transfer to the budget as a share of GPFG assets (2.5–
3.0 percent) would be more appropriate. Such a target would also be closer to the likely returns for
the next decade and would help conserve the GPFG’s resources to address long-run aging-related
costs. More importantly, there should also be a supplementary rule, such that the fiscal impulse
would be neutral or negative when the economy is at or above capacity, respectively. This latter rule
would help prevent crowding out of production of tradable goods and services.
Authorities’ Views
19.
The authorities agreed that fiscal policy should support employment and growth
without inhibiting the necessary adjustment to a non-oil growth model. They noted that given
the significant size of the shock that has hit the economy and the available fiscal space, the planned
fiscal expansion this year can be justified, and the revised budget contains targeted measures to
stimulate activity in the hardest hit regions. However, they agreed that it would not be a desirable
outcome if the public sector rather than the competitive industries were to absorb a large part of
the labor released from the oil-related sectors, or if fiscal expansion becomes a new norm.

B. Monetary Policy: Supporting Demand and Maintaining Price Stability
20.
The Norges Bank reduced its key policy rate to ½ percent in March 2016 in view of
weakened growth prospects and the subdued inflation outlook.
21.
The outlook for inflation is stable (Figure 3). Wage growth in 2016 is expected to be about
2½ percent—down from 2.8 percent in 2015. With inflation expectations well anchored, this implies
that the social partners assume approximately unchanged real wages in 2016. Inflation should stay
slightly above target this year but return to target next year as low capacity utilization weighs on
domestic inflation and the effects of the exchange rate depreciation unwind.6
22.
Monetary policy can stay accommodative for now, although wage developments and the
potential spillover risk from imported inflation to domestic inflation merit continued monitoring.
Further easing could be considered in the event that growth turns out to be significantly weaker
than currently projected, provided that inflation expectations remain well anchored, and negative
rates should not be ruled out in a more adverse scenario.
23.
Financial stability concerns should be addressed primarily through macroprudential
policy and structural measures. The output gap and the financial cycle have diverged as low
interest rates helped push up asset prices. However, in view of the financial system vulnerabilities,
greater caution may be warranted as the policy rate is lowered given risk of acceleration in property

prices and household debt growth. A gradual
return from current negative real rates to the
Norges Bank’s estimated normal real interest
rate of about 1½ percent—corresponding to a
normal nominal interest rate of about 4 percent
given the inflation target—will be needed over
time.

perspective on the monetary policy stance.
They emphasized that monetary policy can facilitate the transition by easing credit and avoiding
appreciation and thereby expedite restoration of competitiveness, provided that confidence in
stable inflation remained firm. They also noted that there is still room for maneuver and the
possibility of negative key policy rate cannot be ruled out should the economy be exposed to new
major shocks. Further easing will however be considered with greater caution as uncertainty with the
effects of monetary policy increases. They agreed that the risk that lower interest rates could
increase financial system vulnerabilities needs to be monitored closely and macroprudential policy is
the first line of defense in maintaining financial stability.

C. Financial Sector Policy: Strengthening Resilience and Reducing
Vulnerabilities
25.
Banking sector performance remains relatively strong, and overall financial stability
risks appear contained. Banks are profitable compared with peers, and the NPL ratio trended down
to 1.1 percent of total loans (Figure 7). Banks’ profitability positions them to meet the core equity
(CET1) capital requirement. FSAP bank stress tests in 2015 suggest that banks’ buffers render them
well-positioned to withstand severe shocks―such as a combined shock of persistently low oil prices
and a contraction in house prices.
26.
However, there are vulnerabilities in the financial system. Elevated household debt,
overvalued house prices, and banks’ heavy reliance on external wholesale funding are the main
sources of financial stability risks. In addition, persistently low oil prices could trigger a deterioration
of household and corporate balance sheets, which will build up banks’ credit risks.


Household debt, house prices, and banks’ real estate sector exposures are all high (Figures
5 and 6). A large increase in interest burdens or severe deterioration in macroeconomic
conditions could translate into losses on banks’ loan portfolios.7

7

In Norway, banks’ losses are more likely to accumulate to the corporate (rather than household) portfolios, given
that: (i) households have sound repayment buffers in view of their high financial asset holdings; and (ii) the full

(continued)
12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

The use of external wholesale funding
makes banks vulnerable to turbulence in
foreign financial markets. This exposure
could be compounded by a potential

to hedge foreign currency funding risks.



27.
Progress has been made on several FSAP recommendations to address key risks
(Annex IV). The countercyclical capital buffer will be increased to 1½ percent from July 1, 2016. Late
last year, the authorities adopted new liquidity rules which set the minimum total “all currency”
liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirement at 100 percent, effective from 2016 for the three
systemically important banks and gradually phased in for other credit institutions.
28.
The authorities have also implemented several housing sector-specific measures. These
include introducing lending guidelines on new mortgages in 2010, which were converted into
regulations in mid-2015 that are set to expire at end-2016. These measures should be made
permanent and tightened if house prices and mortgage credit continue to grow faster than income.
The FSA also tightened parameters for IRB model estimation of residential mortgage risk in 2014–
15. Staff analysis suggests that these measures have had an impact on mortgage growth, but may
not be enough to contain housing market vulnerabilities.9
29.


Action on other key FSAP recommendations would help mitigate systemic risks.
Additional targeted measures could help contain systemic risks arising from the growth of house
prices and household indebtedness. The current loan-to-value (LTV) ratio cap of 85 percent is
relatively high, and additional tools to be considered include: (i) higher mortgage risk weights;
(ii) tighter LTV limits; and (iii) supplementing the affordability test by adding loan-to-income
(LTI) or debt-service-to-income (DSTI) ratio limits. Given the divergent housing market
developments across regions, some measures could be tailored towards individual regional
markets.

recourse nature of mortgages has typically meant that households prioritize mortgage payments over other
payments.



Enhance stress tests to account for funding risks and take additional measures to monitor and
possibly limit banks’ wholesale funding including on the mismatch between the maturity of
currency swaps and underlying exposures.



Strengthen the generally well-developed legal and institutional framework for crisis management,
safety nets, and bank resolution. The authorities should finalize recovery plans, initiate resolution
planning, and conduct resolvability assessments for the largest banks.

30.
Regional cooperation on financial stability issues should be strengthened. This is
particularly important as Swedish-based Nordea, the second largest bank in Norway, plans to
convert its Nordic subsidiaries into branches. In response, the Nordic finance ministries and financial
supervisors are negotiating a new Memorandum of Understanding on issues raised by systemic
branches.
Authorities’ Views
31.
The authorities broadly agreed that there is scope to strengthen the policy framework.
The authorities are monitoring housing market and household debt developments closely, and they
are assessing the impact of existing macroprudential measures. On broadening the set of
macroprudential instruments, they take the view that the current affordability test serves the same
purpose as DTI or DSTI limits, and is more “granular.” Further proposals on individual currency LCR
requirements and the implementation of the BRRD are expected in the second half of 2016.

substantially lower than the years before. Economy-wide nominal wage growth for 2016 is estimated

reallocation as a result of booming oil prices).10
The Productivity Commission’s second-phase report outlined several recommendations in the areas
of education, research and innovation, mobilization of the workforce, and public sector efficiency to
improve productivity and help the Norwegian economy adapt to the ongoing structural changes.
These include fostering better cooperation between the higher education sector and industries,
softening regulation of working hours, making social security benefits more activity-oriented and
enforcing activity requirements, and reforming local government organization, among others. The
authorities should continue with the ongoing reforms, prioritizing and implementing measures that
would likely generate large productivity payoffs.
35.
Past labor market reforms have proven effective, but challenges remain. The 2011
pension reforms have resulted in higher labor force participation among older workers in the private
sector. Now, the public sector pension reforms need to be completed along lines similar to those of
the private sector in the context of current discussions with social partners. In addition, although
Norway’s labor force participation is enviable compared with that of peers, disability and sickness
claims account for a large fraction of lost labor. Welcome changes were recently made to the
disability benefits system to enhance incentives to work while receiving benefits, and pilot programs
for new measures to enforce activity requirements for sickness benefits are showing encouraging
results. Nevertheless, further reforms to sickness and disability benefits would help maintain labor
force participation in the face of population aging, and relieve pressures on the welfare system at a
time of rising unemployment and refugee inflows. In addition, active labor market policies can
improve the efficiency of the search and matching process, thereby facilitating labor reallocation
during the transition.
36.
Other reforms would help promote efficiency and support the transition to a new
growth model. Tax reforms should shift the burden of taxation from labor and corporate income to
property and consumption. In particular, reducing tax preferences for housing would help channel
new investment toward more productive uses, including in non-oil-related tradable sectors. The
recently introduced tax reform contains welcome reductions in the corporate tax rate and the

15

NORWAY

marginal tax rate on personal income, but a shift to higher taxes on property has not been
implemented. The recent political agreement for additional reductions in personal and corporate
income tax rates would if implemented also be a step in the right direction. Additionally, relaxing
constraints on new property construction, including at the municipal level, could boost the supply of
housing, thereby taking some of the pressure off elevated housing prices. Reducing the level of
protection and subsidy to agriculture would have positive distributional effects and also help free up
resources for less expensive and more effective policies to preserve rural communities.
Authorities’ Views
37.
The authorities agreed with staff on the need to restore competitiveness and continue
with structural reforms. They noted that the recent downward adjustment in unit labor costs due
to the weak currency has been quite substantial, and they forecast wage growth to remain low by
historical standard also for next year. They also pointed to ongoing reforms in the areas singled out
by the Productivity Commission, including higher education, research and innovation, and local
government organization. On reducing tax preferences for housing, the discount on the taxable
values of second dwellings and commercial property has been reduced from 50 to 20 percent over
the last three years.

E. Accommodating and Integrating Refugees
38.
The recent influx of asylum seekers creates a number of challenges. In the short-run, the
surge of refugees puts a strain on the systems for receiving them and for processing asylum
applications, raising the fiscal cost. In the medium-run, there are concerns about the capacity to
integrate large numbers of refugees into the fabric of Norway’s economy and society, which in part
depends on their success in the labor market. Just over half of non-Western immigrants, which
includes most refugees, are employed, a rate that is 15 percentage points lower than that for
natives. The recent economic slowdown, which has lowered labor demand, may also make it more
difficult to absorb the recent wave of refugees into the labor market.
39.
Successful integration of refugees would reduce fiscal costs and raise labor supply.
Increasing the employment rate for refugees to the level of natives could temporarily increase the
labor force growth rate by as much as 0.3 percentage points, which would in turn add as much as
0.1–0.2 percentage points to potential growth for a couple years.
40.
Though Norway ranks highly in terms of integration policies, there is scope for
improvement. The introductory program, which includes language training, social studies and other
education, is required for most refugees. This program keeps them out of the labor force for up to
two years, which can lead to an erosion of job related skills. When appropriate, combining language
lessons and other training with work might help ensure a stronger and more rapid attachment to
the labor force. Greater efforts could also be made to assess refugees’ formal and informal
qualifications, to improve matching of refugees with appropriate jobs and training. The likelihood of
refugees being in work or education one year after the introduction course also varies substantially
across municipalities, suggesting there is scope to improve outcomes by spreading the approaches
16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NORWAY

used in the most successful municipalities. The White Paper introduced to Parliament in May 2016
takes several steps along these lines towards improving the introduction program and the
integration of refugees into labor market. Finally, given the relatively compressed wage distribution
and high effective minimum wage in Norway, greater wage flexibility in a temporary and targeted
manner might be considered to incentivize the hiring of refugees.
Authorities’ Views
41.
The authorities emphasized the need to quickly integrate refugees into the labor
market. The measures proposed in the White Paper sent to the Parliament in May should accelerate
integration of high-skilled refugees and speed up processing of those asylum seekers who are more
likely to obtain refugee status. They noted that efforts are underway to personalize integration plans
and to learn from municipalities that have been more successful in integration of refugees.

STAFF APPRAISAL
42.
The Norwegian mainland economy is feeling the impact of lower oil-related income,
but a modest recovery is expected to take root next year. Mainland growth last year slowed to
the lowest level since the crisis, alongside rapidly rising unemployment in oil-dependent regions. At
the same time, exchange rate depreciation is providing a cushion for the economy, boosting
external competitiveness of non-oil industries. The housing market is seeing continued upward price
pressures—albeit with large regional variation, and household debt is at an elevated level. While
consumer and business confidence remains weak, there are signs that the drag from declining
offshore demand on mainland industries has bottomed out. On these trends, mainland growth is set
to hold steady this year before picking up in 2017.
43.
Policymakers are faced with intertwined challenges. In addition to the short-term task of
curbing the downturn, there is the continuing challenge of managing the transition away from oil
dependence. The past oil boom had a profound impact on the mainland economy, leading to an
extended period of rapidly rising incomes while deepening mainland industries’ reliance on offshore
demand. The sound fiscal framework has helped keep public income and expenditure from
crowding out of other tradable goods and services, but the growth of the oil-related parts of the
mainland economy has nevertheless contributed to unsustainably high level of unit labor costs.
These forces are weakening competitiveness and will need to be unwound, supported by policies
that help facilitate a smooth transition to a new, less oil-dependent, growth model.
44.
The expansionary fiscal policy stance this year is justifiable, but fiscal measures should
avoid inhibiting the necessary economic adjustment. Fiscal stimulus can be an appropriate tool
to smooth the transition to a new equilibrium, and Norway has ample fiscal space for such a policy.
However, a permanent shock such as the expected decline in demand from the offshore economy
requires permanent adjustment in the private sector growth model and new sources of net export
earnings. In this context, any fiscal stimulus should focus on temporary measures that do not inhibit
the necessary transition. In particular, non-oil-related tradable industries, rather than the public

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

NORWAY

sector, should absorb a large share of the workers separating from oil and gas-related industries. As
economic growth gathers steam, the fiscal stance should shift to neutral to relieve so-called “Dutch
disease” pressures. In this regard, the staff would welcome a rethinking of the fiscal framework to
provide better operational guidance to fiscal policy, avoid crowding out of production of tradable
goods and services, and conserve the GPFG’s resources for future generations.
45.
Monetary policy should stay accommodative. The current monetary stance is
appropriately supportive and should remain so given the slack in the economy and the stable
inflation outlook. The policy tradeoff between different objectives arguably has eased; however,
potential second-round effects on domestic inflation merit continued monitoring. Provided that
inflation expectations remain well-anchored, further easing could be considered should growth turn
out significantly weaker than projected. While financial vulnerabilities suggest greater caution may
be warranted as the policy rate is lowered, financial stability concerns should be addressed primarily
through macroprudential and other measures in the first instance.
46.
Despite some progress, action on other key FSAP recommendations is needed to
mitigate systemic risks. Norwegian banks are profitable and well-capitalized, and stress tests
indicate that they are well-positioned to cope with severe shocks. The authorities have made
progress on implementing the FSAP recommendations, including putting in place several measures
to address risks in the housing sector. However, given still overvalued house prices, elevated
household debt, and banks’ heavy reliance on external wholesale funding, further measures to
reduce risks are called for. In particular, the regulations on residential mortgages that went into
effect on July 1, 2015 and are set to expire at end-2016 should be made permanent and tightened if
the rapid household debt and house price growth of recent months continues. The authorities
should also continue work on stress-testing for banks to improve liquidity monitoring and on
recovery and resolution planning for the largest banks.
47.
Continued implementation of key structural reforms is important to promote a
successful transition and improve the efficiency of the economy in general. Although the
depreciated exchange rate has temporarily improved Norway’s cost competitiveness, curbing future
real wage increases and reinvigorating productivity growth will be crucial to lowering unit labor
costs relative to peers in a sustained manner. This would enable the non-oil tradable industries to
strengthen their foothold in international markets. In addition, further reforms to the public sector
pension system and sickness and disability benefits will help address labor market challenges and
maintain labor force participation. There is also scope for efficiency gains from reducing tax
preferences for owner-occupied housing, relaxing unnecessary supply restrictions in the housing
market, and lowering the level of protection and subsidy for agriculture.
48.
Timely integration of the newly arrived refugees into productive employment is crucial
for reducing fiscal costs. Refugees can contribute to the Norwegian economy in the long run, but
this potential is not realized until new arrivals become gainfully employed. Although Norway ranks
highly in terms of refugee integration policy, there is scope for speeding up the integration process
and making it more effective. For example, policies such as making the two-year introduction
program more personalized and work-oriented – building on the experiences from the more

successful municipalities – would be helpful. The proposals in the recent White Paper on
accelerating integration of refugees into Norwegian society and providing access to employment
are also welcome.

It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Norway be held on the

Box 1. Risk Assessment Matrix1
Source of Risks and Relative Likelihood
High
Persistently lower energy prices, triggered by
supply factors reversing only gradually.

Sharper-than-expected global growth
slowdown:
 Significant China slowdown Low/Medium
 Structurally weak growth in key advanced and
emerging economies High/Medium
Medium
Widespread and large reduction in house
prices:
 House prices growth slowed in 2015 but
accelerated recently and remain at high levels
with a risk of significant overvaluation.
 Household debt is elevated and keeps rising.
Medium
Tighter or more volatile global financial
conditions:
 Sharp asset price decline and decompression
of credit spreads

Potential Deviations from Baseline
Expected Impact if Risk is Realized
High
 Prolonged low oil prices would undercut growth through a further reduction
in the oil-related demand for mainland goods and services, and adverse
spillover effects on confidence and consumption in the rest of the economy.
Policy response: Ample fiscal space allows more supportive fiscal policy to
facilitate the transition and monetary policy has some scope for further easing.
High
 Sharp global growth slowdown would hurt the ongoing recovery of non-oil
exports and further weaken oil prices. This would lead to lower output and
higher unemployment.
Policy response: When this risk materializes, ample fiscal space and the fiscal rule
allow automatic stabilizers to fully operate and additional discretionary spending
to support demand as needed.
High
 Substantial falls in house prices would dampen private consumption and
reduce residential investment. Reduced corporate earnings could lead to an
increase in default rates that would hurt banks’ balance sheets.
Policy response: Extend the temporary regulations on new mortgages beyond
end-2016 and take additional preemptive and targeted macroprudential
measures to contain risks from a further buildup of high household debt.
Medium
 Renewed stress in global whole sale funding markets could lead to liquidity
strains for Norwegian banks that rely on whole sale funding. The large
presence of foreign-owned banks increases spillover risks.
 Lower asset prices may have negative impact on GPFG’s investment returns.
Policy response: Introduce NSFR requirements and further strengthen
monitoring of liquidity.
Medium
 Resources need to shift from oil-related to non-oil related sectors, and labor
market flexibility will be tested in the process. Exchange rate depreciation
should also help the process unless offset by higher domestic inflation.

Medium
A failure of non-oil-related parts of the
mainland economy to pick up slack resulting
from lower oil prices.
 A shift to a less oil-dependent growth model
could stall if wages fail to adjust or if
exchange-rate induced inflation in imports
becomes generalized inflation.
High
Dislocation in capital and labor flows:
 Heightened risk of fragmentation/security
dislocation in part of the Middle East,
Africa, and Europe, leading to a sharp rise in
migrant flows, with negative global spillovers.
High
British voters elect to leave the EU in their June
23rd referendum, with subsequent renegotiation
of cross-border trade, financial, and migration
relationships. A period of elevated financial
volatility and heightened uncertainty could ensue,
with potential contagion.

1

Policy response: Avoid using public employment to replace declining oil-related
demand in the mainland economy. Adopt competitiveness and productivity
enhancing reforms.
High
If not effectively integrated into the labor market, the increased number of
refugees could weigh on medium to long-term growth and the public finances.
Policy response: Take policy actions to support the integration of migrants into
the labor force, e.g., strengthening refugees’ access to ALMPs and accelerating
the settlement process.
Low
 If financial market disruptions following a British exit from the EU severely
affect euro area and U.S. financial markets, this could lead to higher costs and
liquidity strains for Norwegian banks that rely on whole sale funding.
 If a British exit from the EU is accompanied by a significant slowdown in the
UK, it could (i) hurt Norway’s exports to the UK; and (ii) adversely affect the
profitability of Norwegian banks, insurance companies, and real estate
companies given their direct and indirect exposures, and may result in
deterioration in asset quality.
Policy response: Be prepared to supply liquidity in the event of system liquidity
crunch and re-double efforts to reach new economic cooperation and trade
agreements to minimize disruptions.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the
view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant
to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or
more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non
mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Annex I. External Sector Assessment
Norway’s terms of trade deteriorated further in 2015, but the external position remains solid.
The current account (CA) balance fell from 14.9 percent of (mainland) GDP in 2014 to 10.8 percent of
GDP in 2015. This was largely driven by the 36 percent decline in the value of oil exports as oil prices
fell. In turn, the terms of trade shock has led to 27 percent depreciation in the nominal effective
exchange rate (import weighted) since early 2013. The net international investment position (NIIP)
rose 30 percentage points to 239 percent of GDP, partly due to the depreciation of the exchange
rate raising foreign asset values in local currency terms. Banks remained net external debtors, with
banks’ net external liabilities at around 57 percent of GDP. Reserve assets held steady at just over
19 percent of GDP.
The different approaches of the IMF’s External Balance Assessment (EBA) produce an
unusually broad range of exchange rate

depreciation of the REER since early 2013.
Staff considers the CA and REER index analyses to be more reliable in Norway’s case and
concludes the exchange rate is not significantly undervalued. The large and opposing
indications of exchange rate misalignment from the REER level and ES approaches raise questions
about their suitability for Norway. For one, the model fit of the REER level is not very good in
comparison with the CA and REER index analyses. Also, the fitted values of the REER level model
would have the REER appreciating strongly when the country is suffering a negative terms of trade
shock. At the same time, the ES approaches’ estimate of the optimal current account balance suffers
from several sources of uncertainty, including about future commodity prices and quantities.
The deterioration in cost competitiveness since the 2008–
09 crisis has only recently been unwound by the krone’s
depreciation, which also suggests that the exchange rate is
not substantially undervalued. During 1995–2013, the ULCbased REER appreciated more than 70 percent, while the CPIbased REER was essentially flat. The 20 percent depreciation of
the ULC-based REER since early 2013 has only reversed the
worsening of cost competitiveness since the crisis, but the rate
is still 40 percent higher than it was two decades ago.

Annex III. Asylum Seekers
Until recently, Norwegian immigration was largely driven by economic migrants. In particular,
the number of non-Nordic economic migrants to Norway boomed after the EU enlargements in
2004 and 2007, with much of those flows coming from New Member States (NMS), especially
Poland and Lithuania (Ho and Shirono, 2015). Migrants from the NMS caused overall Norwegian
immigration to more than double as a share of population between 2004 and 2007 (from 0.6 to
1.3 percent) and remained elevated throughout the global financial crisis. However, the flow of
economic migrants began to slow after 2011.

The number of asylum seekers in 2015 was three times higher than in previous years. Norway
received 31,145 asylum seekers (0.6 percent of the population) last year, up from 11,480 in 2014,

accepted.
The latest forecast is for 25,000 refugees in 2016, though this is subject to significant
uncertainty. While the government is projecting fewer asylum seekers this year compared to last
year, it could be as low as 5,000 or as high as 50,000. The main reason for the expected tapering in
the pace of arrivals is that other European countries, especially Sweden and Denmark, have
tightened border controls. This has already contributed a sharp slowdown in arrivals in the first few
months of 2016. Statistics Norway is projecting a further slowdown in the influx of refugees in 2017
and 2018, but the cumulative impact will raise population growth by a few tenths of a percent over
the next few years.
The additional fiscal cost of refugees was initially expected to be around 0.4 percent of
(mainland) GDP in 2016. However, that cost projection was based on expectations of
33,000 refugees in 2016, so it is likely the additional cost will be less than that since the government
has revised down the number of refugees it expects. About half of the financing of additional
refugee related fiscal costs for 2016 will come from a reallocation of overseas development aid to
spending on refugees in Norway, while the rest will come from tax increases, other spending cuts,
and dividends from state owned enterprises.

In late 2015 the government announced a number of measures to tighten the rules and
benefits for asylum seekers. These changes include: (i) reducing benefits for those in reception
centers by up to 20 percent; (ii) increasing the minimum eligibility period for permanent residence
from 3 to 5 years; (iii) issuing more temporary residence permits and then facilitating a return to the
home country if the situation there improves; (iv) using integration criteria to rule on requests for
permanent residency; (v) limiting family reunification rights for refugees; and (vi) coordinating with
Iraq to safely return asylum seekers from that country whenever possible. In addition to cutting
benefits, the government is also replacing cash benefits paid to asylum seekers for food, clothing
and other necessities with vouchers, which will make it more difficult for refugees to send money
home.
While Norway ranks highly on overall integration policy, the employment rate of nonWestern immigrants is substantially lower than of natives. Norway was ranked 4th (out of
38 countries) based on its overall Migrant Integration Policy Index (MIPEX) score in 2014. It was

unemployment rate is also much higher at 15 percent compared to the overall unemployment rate

This suggests there is a need to enhance integration programs targeted towards refugees. The
introduction program many refugees are required to take lasts two years and delays their entry into
the labor market (OECD, 2009). Combining language and other training with work experience earlier
in the process could help. Additionally, quickly evaluating qualifications and past work experience
could facilitate matching refugees with appropriate training or work opportunities.

Annex VI. The Operation of the Fiscal and Monetary Policy Rules
in an Oil Price Shock
Norway introduced rules in 2001 that set quantitative targets for fiscal and monetary policy with an
eye toward insulating the mainland economy from shocks to oil and gas revenue and prices. The sharp
decline in oil prices starting in mid-2014, combined with the long-anticipated peak in demand for
mainland goods and services from the offshore sector, put these rules to the test.
The Fiscal Policy Rule
The Fiscal Policy Rule—The fiscal policy rule provides that, “Fiscal policy is guided by the fiscal rule,
stipulating a gradual phasing-in of oil revenues in the Norwegian economy in line with the expected
real returns on the Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG), estimated at 4 percent. The fiscal rule
permits spending more than the expected return on the Fund in a cyclical downturn, while the use
of oil revenues should lie below the expected return when capacity utilisation in the economy is
high.”1 Adherence to the fiscal rule has allowed the GPFG to grow to 286 percent of mainland GDP
at end-2015. In recent years, the structural non-oil deficit (and therefore the transfer from the GPFG)
has been kept well below 4 percent of the GPFG capital. In spite of this, the continued faster-paced
growth of the GPFG relative to the mainland economy has allowed a widening non-oil deficit as
percentage of mainland GDP and a positive fiscal impulse on average since 2001.
The fiscal rule operated largely as intended in response to the mid-2014 to early-2016 drop in
oil prices and the decline in demand for goods and services from the offshore economy. The
authorities responded to a modest slowdown in mainland GDP growth (from 2.3 percent in 2013–14
to 1.0 percent in 2015) by allowing structural non-oil deficits of 6.3 and 7.5 percent of mainland GDP
in 2015 and 2016, corresponding to estimated fiscal impulses of 0.5 percent and 1.1 percent of
mainland GDP respectively. Most of the increase in the headline deficit is explained by the operation
of automatic stabilizers. Nevertheless, the structural deficits for both last and this year remain below
3 percent of the value of the GPFG.
The Monetary Policy Rule
The Inflation Targeting Rule—The Norges Bank defines the rule as follows: “The operational target
of monetary policy shall be annual consumer price inflation of close to 2.5 per cent over time.
Monetary policy shall also contribute to stabilising output and employment.” Also: “Monetary policy
influences the economy with long and variable lags. Norges Bank sets the interest rate with a view
to stabilising inflation close to the target in the medium term. The relevant horizon will depend on
disturbances to which the economy is exposed and how they affect the path for inflation and the
1

42

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NORWAY

real economy ahead.” Finally, it indicates how inflation should be measured in some detail: “In
general, the direct effects on consumer prices resulting from changes in interest rates, taxes, excise
duties and extraordinary temporary disturbances shall not be taken into account.”2
The Norges Bank also sets out three criteria for setting the policy rate. The Bank sets an interest
rate path to maintain inflation close to 2.5 percent such that: (i) the inflation target is achieved;
(ii) the inflation targeting regime is flexible; and (iii) monetary policy is robust. The first weighs on
the expected level of inflation. The second criterion gives weight to avoiding excessive fluctuations
in output and employment. The last criterion seeks to mitigate the risk of a buildup of financial
imbalances by adopting a gradualist approach to interest rate setting.3
The drop in oil prices and other developments pull monetary policy in different directions.
Following the 2014 drop in oil prices, the exchange rate depreciated in parallel with the oil price
although not by as large a proportion. Notwithstanding the insulation of the mainland economy
from oil revenues, such a close link between movements in oil prices and the krone is the norm. The
depreciation has pushed up imported consumer goods inflation, while domestic goods and services
and wage inflation have remained more subdued. Growth slowed significantly in 2015 and early
2016 although it remained positive, under the twin effects of the slowdown in oil-related demand
and the subsequent drop in oil prices. At the same time, house prices continued to grow strongly in
real terms in the Oslo area, although not in those parts of the country most dependent on demand
from the offshore sector.
Monetary policy has tried to balance its response to these diverging economic developments.
The policy rate was reduced four times from 1.5 to 0.5 percent between December 2014 and March
2015. This has supported the economy and avoided an appreciation in a period when many
neighboring economies (Denmark, the euro area, and Sweden) have reduced policy rates to
negative levels. The Norges Bank has judged that the risk of medium term inflation in excess of the
target is low given that capacity utilization is low, real wage growth is close to zero, inflation
expectations are well anchored, and the influence of the exchange rate depreciation on consumer
prices should be temporary. On elevated and rising house prices and household debt, they take the
view that macroprudential policies should be the main instrument to address the risk that lower
interest rates could further increase financial vulnerabilities.

Annex VII. The Transition from Oil and Gas
The oil boom during the 2000s had a profound impact on the Norwegian economy. In
particular, there is some evidence that resources reallocated toward the oil-related and nontradables
sectors during the boom.1 Industry-level data point to a clear pick-up in the growth rates of both
employment and the capital stock in the nontradables sectors during the boom period, whereas
they both declined in the traditional sector.2 However, developments in the oil-related sector were
rather mixed; while oil-related investment accelerated during the boom, the growth in oil-related
employment seemed to have slowed. Resource reallocation during the oil boom may have
contributed to lowering productivity growth. A decomposition of aggregate total factor productivity
(TFP) growth suggests that within-sector productivity contributed about two-thirds of the decline in
TFP during the boom, while sectoral reallocation contributed the remaining one third. In addition, a
comparison of the economy’s input-output structure between the mid-1990s and mid-2000s
suggests that a number of mainland industries are increasingly dependent on the oil and gas sector.

As offshore investment drops from its peak and oil prices retreat from their high in 2014, the
economy is going through a transition away from oil dependence. The preliminary data show
an ongoing marked decline in oil-related production and investment, whereas activity in the
traditional goods sector is holding up, but not yet sufficiently to pick up the slack. However, the

In our analysis, the “oil-related” sector consists of the oil and gas extraction industry (including services incidental
to oil and gas if separately defined) and the manufacturing industries with close links to oil and gas (i.e. machinery
and equipment, shipbuilding). The “traditional” sector consists of the remainder of manufacturing, and the
“nontradables” sector corresponds to business services.

44

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NORWAY

weak krone is providing significant cushion for mainland businesses, not only boosting traditional
goods exports but also improving the adaptability of firms in the oil-related sector, enabling them
to win contracts in alternative markets. Meanwhile, labor is inevitably being released from oil-related
sector, and rising unemployment continues to be concentrated mainly in the oil-related parts of the
economy. One mechanism that could dampen the rise in unemployment is flexible labor supply by
immigrants, and net immigration—while still positive—has been trending down. In addition, labor
mobility across sectors and regions, which generally is high in Norway, would also help with
reabsorbing the oil-related unemployment.
A number of policies can help smooth the transition. Monetary policy should support demand
and preserve price stability, thereby creating a favorable economic environment for private sector
firms to thrive. Fiscal stimulus measures should best focus on expanding the economy’s productive
capacity while avoiding crowding out of tradable goods and services production. Wage formation
will also play an important role in facilitating labor movement and ensuring international
competitiveness, while active labor market policies can support the transition by improving the
efficiency of the search and matching process. In addition, reducing the constraints to new housing
construction particularly in big cities such as Oslo would help relieve pressures on housing prices
and make it easier for people to move to areas where employment prospects are more favorable.
Over the longer term, investing in research and innovation—an area where Norway lags peers—
would help attract resources to the “knowledge-based economy” that would ultimately replace
natural resources.

Zealand, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and United Kingkom. Frontier refers to average best three countries in the
comparator group.

An extensive firm-level dataset is employed to estimate the productivity payoffs of product
market reforms. The Orbis database compiled by Bureau Van Dijk provides financial data at the
firm level on value added, number of employees, and fixed assets, among other variables. The
dataset for Norway consists of 80,474 public and private firms for the period between 2005 and
2014, resulting in over 125,000 firm-year observations. Different measures of firm productivity are
calculated for the analysis, including both labor productivity (i.e., real value added per worker) and
three measures of total factor productivity (TFP) for each firm using three different methodologies.
We measure the burden from PMR for all sectors in the Norwegian economy using inputoutput linkages between regulated and downstream sectors. As a measure of regulation, we use
the OECD’s indicators for seven network sectors, retail and professional services. Regulation in those
industries can affect firms in other sectors of the economy (i.e. the downstream sectors) through
their use of upstream inputs. For example, a manufacturer who relies more extensively on the use of
rail and postal services would bear a heavier burden from regulation in those sectors, either through
paying higher prices or enduring lack of or sub-optimal quality of services. We call this indirect
burden from regulation upstream PMR and measure it by combining the PMR indicator with the
intensity of upstream input usage calculated from Norway’s input-output table for the year 2013.
Panel regression results suggest that regulation in upstream sectors significantly affects firm
productivity in downstream sectors. The results point to a negative and significant correlation
between upstream PMR and firm productivity in downstream sectors, and are robust to multiple

46

NORWAY

specifications and different productivity measures. Firms operating in sectors that rely more heavily
on inputs from the regulated industries are likely to be less productive than others. Our results also
suggest that the impact of PMR on firm productivity varies by firm size: it is most pronounced for
medium-sized firms and least pronounced for large firms, with the impact on micro and small firms
being somewhere in the middle. For example, a one standard deviation reduction in PMR is
associated with higher TFP by over 15 percent for medium-sized firms, but only by 6 percent for
large firms.
We also find evidence that PMR affects innovation intensive firms disproportionately. We use
Eurostat’s taxonomy of high- and medium-technology manufacturing sectors and knowledge
intensive services at the NACE 3-digit level to classify firms into two categories—`HTKIS’ (high-tech
and knowledge-intensive sector) firms and `non-HTKIS’ firms. The idea is that a higher level of
product market competition would be expected to spur innovation particularly for firms in
technology or knowledge intensive sectors, thereby generating larger productivity gains. Our results
indicate that HTKIS firms tend to bear a relatively heavier burden from anti-competitive regulation.
The differential impact is again largest for the medium size class, about three times as large for
HTKIS firms as for non-HTKIS.

Annex IX. The Housing Boom and Macroprudential Policy in
Norway
High and rising house prices and household debt in Norway pose important macro-financial
stability risks. Real house prices have risen more than 80 percent in Norway since 2000. Currently,
house prices are estimated to be 40 percent overvalued (averaged across three standard
overvaluation measures). Household indebtedness has risen along with house prices, exceeding
220 percent of disposable income by end-2015, which is higher than in most comparator countries.
High household debt and house prices increase the risk of a sharp house price correction, which
could have a deleterious impact on consumption and output. In turn, this would adversely impact
non-financial firms and increase loan defaults, stressing banks’ balance sheets.
The authorities have introduced a number of measures targeted at the housing market in
recent years. A number of guidelines related to mortgage lending were introduced in 2010–11 and
were made temporary regulations in mid-2015 (effective until end-2016), perhaps the most
important of which was the LTV ratio limit of 85 percent. Additionally, the FSA effectively raised risk
weights on mortgages during 2014–15, in response to the marked decline in mortgage risk weights
in banks using the IRB approach following the introduction of Basel II standards in 2007.
Empirical evidence suggests that LTV limits and mortgage risk weights can have significant
effects on the growth of mortgage credit and house prices. Following Krznar and Morsink
(2014), we assess the effectiveness of the existing demand and supply-side housing-related
macroprudential tools in Norway controlling for other factors using two separate equations for the
growth of mortgage credit and house prices. The estimation results suggest that a 10 percentage
point increase in mortgage risk weights is estimated to significantly reduce mortgage credit growth
by 2.4 percentage points. Tightening of LTV limits starts to have a statistically significant dampening
impact on mortgage growth only after several months. A ten point change in the net balance
measure of banks’ tightening of their LTV limits
over the next 3 months would reduce mortgage
credit growth by 0.6 percentage points. The
estimated parameters are used to calculate
counterfactuals for mortgage credit growth
without changes in mortgage risk weights or
LTV limits, which show that recent credit growth
would have been substantially higher without
the rise in risk weights. Through their impact on
mortgage credit growth, tightening of
macroprudential instruments can significantly
slow house price growth.
Results based on a DSGE model suggest that tightening macroprudential measures can reduce
household debt ratios with relatively little impact on consumption over the medium-term. A
DSGE model is calibrated to the Norwegian economy and used to illustrate the potential impact of

48

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NORWAY

tightening the LTV cap, increasing the amortization requirement, and reducing the tax deductibility
of mortgage interest. The size of the impact and length of time it takes to achieve their full impact
varies for the different instruments. The reduction in the tax deductibility achieves almost all of its
steady state impact in 5 years and reduces the steady state debt-to-income (DTI) ratio by just over
11 percentage points. Tightening the LTV cap achieves about half the impact on the debt ratio after
5 years, while the new steady state DTI ratio is about 20 percentage points lower. Similarly,
strengthening the amortization requirement leads to about a 20 percentage point reduction in the
DTI ratio in the new steady state, but only achieves about one third of that after 5 years. In all cases,
the impact on consumption is minimum and even slightly positive for most.
Systemic risks from overvalued house prices and high household debt levels suggest that
macroprudential policy measures could be tightened further. Addressing structural factors
contributing to high household debt and house prices, such as mortgage interest tax deductibility,
would reinforce the impact of macroprudential policy measures.

Statement by Thomas Ostros, Executive Director for Norway,
and Tove Katrine Sand, Advisor to Executive Director
June 29, 2016
On behalf of the Norwegian authorities, we would like to thank staff for the open and
constructive discussions in Oslo and a well-written report on the Norwegian economy.
The analysis of the current economic conditions and challenges, the forecasts and the
policy recommendations in the staff report are broadly in line with those of the
authorities.
Fall in oil price accelerates the need for a less oil-dependent growth model
The fall in oil prices have curbed economic growth in Norway. The petroleum sector and
its supply industries are especially affected, but there have also been negative spillover
effects to other parts of the economy. Last year, the growth in the mainland economy
(excluding oil and gas) was 1.0 percent, which is significantly below the 2 percent trend
growth. Growth is expected to stay around 1.0 percent this year, picking up to 1.7 percent
next year. According to the Labor Force survey, the unemployment rate increased from
3.5 percent in 2014 to 4.6 percent in April this year. The increase has principally been in
the more oil-dependent southern and western regions.
Already prior to the sharp fall in oil prices, demand impulses from the petroleum sector
were expected to decrease, after several years of very high growth. The drop in the oil
price accelerates and reinforces this development. As noted in the staff report, this makes
it even more important to succeed in managing a smooth transition to a less oil-dependent
growth model. According to the authorities’ most recent forecasts, oil investments will
continue to fall in the three coming years. The decline is dampened by large investments
in a new petroleum field (Johan Sverdrup), the third largest field on the Norwegian
continental shelf and the biggest when it comes to investments. Even so, an important
growth engine for the Norwegian economy has lost its momentum.
The oil price has increased somewhat since a record low in January, and unemployment
seems to have levelled off recently. This lowers the likelihood of a sharper contraction in
the Norwegian economy. However, there is considerable uncertainty about future
developments in the global economy. For example, a drop in demand from China or other
emerging economies can affect both important commodity prices and the activities of
export-oriented enterprises in Norway.
House price inflation accelerated recently after a slowdown throughout 2015, albeit with
large regional variation. High house prices and a high debt level among households
represent other key challenges to the economy. These pose a risk to financial stability. As
pointed out in the staff report, household debt remains elevated at 220 percent of
disposable income. The debt burden is unevenly distributed, and young households are
vulnerable to adverse shocks. There is a risk that a fall in house prices can amplify or
trigger a downturn in the Norwegian economy.

2
Monetary policy has dampened the downturn
The Norges Bank operates a flexible inflation targeting regime, giving weight in its
interest rate setting to developments in output and employment as well as inflation. In the
current situation, monetary policy will remain accommodative. Over the past two years
monetary policy has responded to weaker growth, and the key policy rate is now 0.5
percent. According to the Norges Bank’s assessment of the outlook in June, the policy
rate may be reduced in the course of 2016.
The expansionary monetary policy is supportive of the needed structural adjustments in
the Norwegian economy. A weaker Norwegian krone and a more moderate wage growth
have improved cost competitiveness substantially. However, the cost level is still high
compared with trading partners and productivity growth is subdued. Inflation has
increased, but inflation expectations are well anchored. Capacity utilization in the
mainland economy is expected to decline further in the period to autumn 2017, edging up
thereafter. In an economy marked by restructuring, monetary policy cannot fully
counteract the effects on output and employment.
Lower interest rates could increase financial system vulnerabilities. As the key policy rate
approaches a lower bound, the uncertainty surrounding the effects of monetary policy
increases. This suggests proceeding with greater caution in interest rate setting and
reacting somewhat less to news that changes the economic outlook, whether this pulls in
the direction of a lower or higher key policy rate. Should the Norwegian economy be
exposed to new major shocks, Norges Bank will not exclude the possibility that the key
policy rate may turn negative.
Fiscal policy is also growth supportive, with strong emphasis on long-term
sustainability
The Norwegian fiscal framework is designed to handle the petroleum wealth, both in
terms of the inherent oil price volatility and in terms of distribution between generations.
The framework is flexible and gives ample strength to handle temporary setbacks in the
economy. The framework has been put to the test by the significant drop in oil prices the
last couple of years.
In the current situation, the fiscal stance is expansionary with an estimated impulse this
year of around 1 percent of mainland trend GDP. Spending of petroleum revenues
corresponds to 2.8 percent of the Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG), well under
the 4 percent estimated long-term return on the Fund indicated in the fiscal framework.
The authorities share the key point in staff’s report that the decline in oil-related activities
is a structural trait that cannot merely be met by short-term fiscal policy measures. An
overly expansionary fiscal policy would harm the private sector’s competitiveness and
therefore be counterproductive to the transition to a less oil driven economy. Still, the
fairly rapid increase in unemployment justifies targeted measures in an attempt to ease
the consequences for the affected individuals and regions, as well as for the economy as a
whole.
Staff finds the fiscal stance for 2016 justifiable, but stress the need for a tighter fiscal
policy once the economy gets back on track. To that end, two modifications to the
existing fiscal framework are put forward by staff. One is that the yearly spending of oil

3
money should be kept significantly below 4 percent of the Fund. The second is
introducing a supplementary rule saying that the fiscal impulse should be neutral or
negative when the economy is at or above capacity, respectively.
These modifications are to some extent similar to the proposals put forward by the
government appointed Fiscal Rule Commission. However, staff’s proposals go further in
decoupling spending of oil revenues from the value of the Fund, implying a more severe
revision of framework. Such revisions would risk undermining the fiscal rule as a longterm yardstick for phasing in the oil and gas revenues to the Norwegian economy. The
Fiscal Rule Commission’s recommendations will be addressed in the Government’s
white paper on Long-term Economic Perspectives early next year, and seen in connection
with the advice from another government appointed commission which is set up to
discuss the equity share of the Government Pension Fund Global.
Tax policy and structural reforms
The Norwegian authorities put strong emphasis on pursuing a fiscal policy that can
increase the growth potential of the economy. A shift in spending towards lower taxes,
increased infrastructure investments and increases on education and research are core in
this strategy.
In May, a broad majority of the parties represented in the Norwegian parliament agreed
on a tax reform that entails a reduction of the corporate income tax from 27 to 23 percent
over the three-year period 2016–2018. The implementation started already in 2016 with a
reduction to 25 percent. The authorities believe reducing the corporate tax will encourage
investments and at the same time make it less beneficial to shift profits out of Norway to
low-tax jurisdictions. To further secure the tax base, the Parliament has also requested
several targeted measures to counter profit shifting. The tax reform will also reduce the
overall marginal tax rate on personal income, thus making it more attractive to work.
The staff report also calls for further reduction of tax preferences for housing. The
authorities point out that the discount on the taxable values of second dwellings and
commercial property, with respect to the wealth tax, has already been cut from 50 to 20
percent over the last three years. In addition, the wealth tax rate has been cut from 1.0 to
0.8 percent.
In February, the Norwegian Productivity Commission published its second report. The
Commission highlights higher education, research and innovation, a well-functioning
labor market and efficiency in the public sector as areas where reforms could give large
potential gains. The authorities concur with staff’s assessment that continued
implementation of key structural reforms is important to promote a successful transition
and improve the efficiency of the economy in general.
As noted by staff, the disability reform in 2015 strengthened the incentives to work while
receiving benefits. The focus on activity in the sickness benefit system is also
strengthened. The authorities see further need for reforms to the early retirement scheme.
Further, the occupational public sector pension scheme needs to be reformed in line with
the reform that has been carried out in the private sector. A technical report, drawing up
main principles of a new system, was established in cooperation with the social partners
in December 2015. Further process to reach an agreement on a new pension model is not

4
decided upon yet, and the Government has invited the partners to further cooperation
during the second half of 2016.
Financial Sector Policy
The authorities generally concur with staff’s assessment of Financial Sector Policy. As
the staff report highlights, banking sector performance remains relatively strong and
banks’ profitability positions enable them to meet the core equity (CET1) capital
requirement. Further, it finds that overall financial stability risks appear contained.
However, staff’s assessment underlines the risks and vulnerabilities associated with
Norwegian households’ indebtedness, a possible house price reversal and banks’ reliance
on wholesale funding. Staff notes that the authorities have implemented several housing
sector-specific measures. These include temporary regulations of loan to value ratios that
are set to expire at the end of 2016 and permanently tightened parameters for internal
ratings-based (IRB) model estimation of residential mortgage risk. Should house prices
and mortgage credit continue to grow faster than income, the authorities agree with staff
that these measures should be made permanent and possibly tightened. The authorities
are monitoring the housing market and household debt developments closely. The new
regulations will be continuously evaluated in light of future developments. In addition,
measures are taken to increase the housing supply in order to dampen price growth.
The authorities also agree that Norwegian banks must continue their efforts to strengthen
their capital base, assure more robust funding and improved liquidity. Loan losses are
low, but banks should be prepared for the possibility of increased losses in the next few
years. The authorities note that the micro and macro prudential supervision of liquidity
risks in Norwegian banks have improved significantly since the international financial
crisis, and that there are continuous efforts to improve the systems and procedures in
place to supervise and monitor risks. This includes increased cooperation between the
FSA and Norges Bank. In addition, proposals on individual currency liquidity coverage
ratios (LCR) requirements and the implementation of the bank recovery and resolution
directive (BRRD) are expected in the second half of 2016.
Staff notes that regional cooperation on financial stability issues should be strengthened,
particularly in light of the Swedish bank Nordea’s plans to convert its Nordic subsidiaries
into branches. The authorities note that Nordea as a subsidiary is the second largest bank
in Norway, and systemically important. This is the first time a branchification of this size
is in question in the EU. It therefore raises some principle questions regarding financial
stability in the host country. The authorities agree that there is need for stronger
cooperation on financial stability issues beyond current EU rules, i.a. host country capital
requirements and supervisory information sharing. Still, the full responsibility for both
supervision and financing arrangements in a crisis situation for a branch remains in the
home country. Work is in progress between the Nordic FSAs and the Ministries to agree
on a MoU for significant branches/systemically important branches, which also includes
more use of host country rules and information sharing.
