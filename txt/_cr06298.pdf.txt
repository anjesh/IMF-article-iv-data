EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Bulgaria has experienced good growth in recent years, but large external imbalances pose
new challenges:
•

Private sector confidence has increased with impending EU accession, contributing to
rapid growth of private domestic demand and rising current account deficits.

•

Fiscal policy has been tightened but external imbalances have continued to grow.

•

Bank lending to the non-government sector has slowed, but non-bank financial
intermediation and foreign debt are growing rapidly.

•

The pace of structural reform has decelerated, constraining potential output growth.

Discussions focused on how to limit rising underlying vulnerabilities while taking
advantage of the opportunities offered by EU accession.
Outlook: Staff and authorities agreed that growth is likely to pick up in 2006 and the medium
term. Different assessments of the Balassa-Samuelson effect over the medium term led staff to
project a slightly higher inflation rate than the authorities. Both staff and authorities expect a
widening current account deficit in 2006 and a gradual narrowing over the medium term as
exports pick up.
Euro adoption: Staff and authorities agreed that euro adoption could reduce external
vulnerabilities. Success within EMU will require increasing the economy’s flexibility through
deeper structural reforms.
Fiscal policy: Staff and authorities agreed that persistent vulnerabilities over the medium term
would mean there would be scope for only a gradual loosening of the fiscal stance from the
projected 2006 surplus of 3.2 percent GDP. Increased financial flows from the EU will add to
demand pressures, but also to supply capacity over time. Staff and authorities agreed that, after
taking these flows fully into account, the 2007 budget should aim at a surplus of about 2 percent
of GDP.
Financial sector policy: Staff and authorities agreed that the demand restraining impact of the
credit measures was waning rapidly while the distortionary costs were rising. It was agreed that
the BNB will phase out the measures with minimum disruption to the banking system while
maintaining a tight prudential framework.
Structural policies: Staff and authorities agreed that structural reforms need to be revitalized to
raise medium term growth prospects and reduce external vulnerabilities. Although legislative
frameworks have been strengthened, implementation remains weak and stronger reform effort is
required in the areas of business environment, public infrastructure, the labor market and the
health and education sectors. A more forceful fight against high level corruption is urgently
needed.

I.

INTRODUCTION

1.
A staff team1 visited Sofia during May 4-17, 2006 to conduct the 2006 Article IV
consultation and the Third Review under the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA). The 25month precautionary arrangement in the amount of SDR 100 million (15.62 percent of quota)
was approved on August 6, 2004. The second review was completed on April 3, 2006 (IMF
Country Report No. 06/131). Discussions focused on policies to end-2006 following the
authorities’ decision to request extension of the SBA to end-March 2007 (LOI, ¶4).
2.
The three-party government formed after parliamentary elections in June 2005
remains coalesced around achieving EU accession in 2007. The European Commission
(EC) has announced that its recommendation on the timing of accession will be delayed until
September 2006 and will be contingent on progress in areas such as combating organized
crime, corruption and money laundering, and strengthened financial controls over EU project
funds. Presidential elections follow soon after in November.
3.
This Article IV consultation takes place against a backdrop of broadly favorable
economic performance but greater underlying vulnerabilities. The benign international
economic environment of recent years and confidence in Bulgaria’s transition prospects have
buoyed investment and growth. At the same time, the external current account deficit has
widened and external debt has increased. Managing risks remains the central challenge
facing the authorities and is a principal aim of the program under the SBA.
II. BACKGROUND TO THE DISCUSSIONS
A. Recent Economic Developments
4.
GDP growth has been strong. GDP grew by 5½ percent in 2005, up from an
average of 4.8 percent during 2001-04 (Text Table 1). The contribution of domestic demand
to growth jumped sharply in 2005 (Table 2); both consumption and investment grew strongly
while net exports fell, a pattern that was sustained during the first quarter of 2006. The
buoyancy of domestic demand can be traced to rapid growth of credit to businesses and
households. With the general government budget surplus rising in 2004-2005, and
prospectively again in 2006, fiscal policy has been providing partially offsetting negative
impulses.

5.
There has been a steady increase in inflation over the last year, although core
inflation has fallen recently (Figure 1). Rising inflation reflected both temporary and more
durable factors. Oil price hikes and flood-related shortages in 2005 raised CPI inflation to
6.5 percent by end-2005. Inflation has increased sharply during the first five months of 2006,
due largely to excise tax increases, reaching 8.5 percent in May. Core inflation closely
tracked the overall CPI during the first half of 2005, but has declined since.
6.
Wage growth has remained moderate. Incomes policies have generally helped to
moderate economy-wide wage demands, contributing to a fall in unemployment, which
reached a low of 9.7 percent (ILO definition) in the first quarter of 2006. Wages in the
manufacturing sector have remained in line with productivity growth.
7.
Credit growth has slowed considerably, constrained by ceilings imposed by the
BNB (Table 3). Bank credit growth decelerated to 32 percent in 2005 from nearly 50 percent
in 2004.2 However, the high cost of the penalty deposits imposed under the credit ceilings
has increased banks’ incentives for circumvention, notably by transferring existing credits
abroad and through intermediation via non-bank financial institutions. Nevertheless, banks
remain profitable and capital adequacy ratios are high (Table 4). Although non-standard
loans (overdue by 30 days) increased during 2005, NPLs (overdue by 90 days) remain stable
at around 2.3 percent of total loans.

2

Following the introduction of the credit measures, new bank deposits exceeded bank lending in 2005 and
commercial banks' net foreign assets increased, a reversal from the developments during 2004.

7
8.
The current account deficit, which doubled in 2005 to 11.8 percent of GDP,
deteriorated further to 14.6 percent of GDP during the first four months of 2006
(Table 5). Both buoyant domestic demand and supply shocks have contributed to the
deterioration, while competitiveness indicators are satisfactory.
•

Real import growth has remained high despite a sharp increase in import prices. The
growth of goods imports has been dominated by capital goods, propelled by strong
investment growth, both domestic-sourced and FDI.

•

Higher oil prices have pushed up nominal imports.

•

One-off factors, including adverse effects of summer floods last year and a temporary
shutdown of a major steel producer for plant expansion, explain much of the
weakened export outcome.

•

Although the ULC-based REER appreciated slightly during 2005, most
competitiveness indicators are satisfactory (Box 1). Moreover, when viewed in a
wider CEEC context, the drop in export growth in 2005 appears to have had a
regional dimension.3

9.
The current account deficit continues to be substantially financed by FDI flows.
During the first quarter of 2006, net FDI inflows covered 70 percent of the deficit.4 With
early repayments to the IMF and the World Bank, gross reserves declined modestly since
end-2005, but remained at 140 percent of short-term debt at original maturity. External debt,
however, rose to nearly 69.5 percent of GDP by the end of the first quarter of 2006, up by
about 9¼ percentage points from end-2003.

With privatization receipts falling steadily in recent years, greenfield investments as a share of overall FDI
flows have been increasing.

B. Policy Developments
10.
Fiscal policy has been cautious for several years, and is being tightened further
in 2006 (Table 6).

in recent years compares favorably with other emerging markets (Text Figure 1).
11.
The BNB introduced successively tighter credit limits and enhanced prudential
measures. The authorities temporarily raised penalties for breach of the credit ceilings and
introduced prudential requirements for household loans, including mortgages.5 With nonbank intermediation gaining importance, the authorities have also taken steps to monitor
leasing activities and are seeking ways to improve supervision of insurance companies and
pension funds.
12.
The structural reform momentum has weakened. There have been frequent delays
in implementing reforms in key areas such as improving the business climate, privatization,
governance and, until recently, improving labor market flexibility. As a result, Bulgaria
performs relatively poorly on the basis of a number of structural indicators (Table 8).
III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
13.
The discussions centered on policies to contain macroeconomic imbalances and
achieve sustainable high growth. With persistently strong domestic demand pressures
contributing to the continued widening of the external current account deficit and a rising
gross external debt burden, there was broad agreement that restrictive macroeconomic
policies—in particular, fiscal policy—would continue to be required in the foreseeable

9
future. At the same time, there was recognition that in order to set the stage for more rapid
convergence to EU living standards, the structural reform effort needed to be reinvigorated.
Accordingly, the discussions covered the following key questions:
•

What is the appropriate short-term macro policy stance in light of underlying
macroeconomic and financial sector vulnerabilities?

•

Beyond the short term, how should macroeconomic policies be adapted to the new
environment after EU accession? In particular, given that external vulnerabilities will
diminish only gradually and that EU financial flows will tend to impart positive fiscal
stimulus and demand pressures, what should be the stance of fiscal policy over the
medium term?

•

What are the key elements of a structural reform agenda that can help ensure
competitiveness within the EU and place Bulgaria on a higher sustainable growth
path?

14.
The authorities reiterated their intention to join ERM2 shortly after EU
accession and to maintain the CBA at an unchanged peg until euro adoption in 2009-10
(Third Supplementary Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies, ¶2). Staff
supported these goals, noting that euro adoption is likely to reduce external vulnerabilities
and accelerate integration with the EU. However, staff cautioned that macroeconomic and
structural policies needed to be supportive of this framework since a more flexible economy
would be better able to handle shocks both before and after euro adoption.
A. Macroeconomic Framework
15.
The authorities and staff concurred that the 2006 macroeconomic outlook is
broadly favorable, albeit still marked by large external imbalances:
•

Real GDP growth is projected at 5.6 percent, slightly higher than in 2005. Domestic
demand growth should remain strong, though slower than last year. A less negative
contribution of net exports than in 2005 is expected as real export growth recovers,
including initially from last year’s one-off effects.

•

Consumer price inflation is expected to moderate during the second half of the year
and reach 6.2 percent at year-end, as temporary factors driving recent price increases
unwind.

•

After widening further in the first four months of 2006, the 12-month current account
deficit is expected to narrow to 12.4 percent of GDP for the full year, reflecting the
projected export recovery. With about three-quarters of the deficit covered by FDI,
the gross external debt ratio is expected to rise to nearly 70 percent of GDP.

10

16.
There was also agreement on medium-term economic prospects—which assume
that Bulgaria joins the EU on January 1, 2007—although inflation projections caused
some debate (Table 9). Staff noted that an acceleration of structural reforms—in the context
of reduced macroeconomic imbalances—would be required to enjoy the full benefits of
economic integration with the EU. Under suitable policies, growth could then rise to about
6 percent over the medium

rates prevailing in the
eurozone, reflecting Balassa-Samuelson effects and administered price increases, which
would likely exceed the currently expected Maastricht inflation criterion on average. The
BNB argued that Balassa-Samuelson effects would be minimal and therefore projected
inflation below 3 percent.

Staff noted that Bulgaria’s economic transition is likely to continue to be marked
by large current account deficits and only gradual reductions in external debt. As in
other transition countries, growth
Text Figure 2. Average Current Account Deficits and

has been accompanied by high
current account deficits (Text
Figure 2). The deficits mainly
reflect consumption smoothing and
catch-up effects and are not
necessarily symptomatic of
competitiveness problems. Indeed,

are expected to cover three-quarters of the current account deficit on average, and gross
external debt would decline to about 61 percent of GDP by 2011.
18.
While near-term crisis risks are low, slow progress in structural reform poses a
medium-term risk. The authorities underscored that strong liquidity buffers and other
macro-prudential indicators provided some near-term comfort (Box 4). Although private
sector external debt has increased

of the rise is FDIrelated (i.e., financing from foreign companies to local subsidiaries, largely to import
investment goods) and long-term borrowing. However, staff noted there were reasons for
concern as large imbalances increased risks and implied significant adjustments to ensure
sustainability. Furthermore, the ongoing credit boom increases financial sector
vulnerabilities. The baseline scenario assumes EU accession on January 1, 2007, sustained
large capital inflows, and an adequate margin of competitiveness.9 However, a less benign
scenario, involving for example a sudden “flight to quality” and a redirection of capital flows
away from Bulgaria, would require a substantial macroeconomic correction. The authorities
agreed that absent prudent macro policies, more forceful implementation of structural reform,
and vigilant supervision of the financial sector, economic performance could deteriorate and
the current account deficit and gross debt levels would not decline as envisaged (Table 15
and 15a). In short, the economy’s underlying vulnerabilities would not abate, and the
likelihood of a low growth/high debt scenario and of unpleasant adjustments to domestic
absorption would rise.10

12
B. Fiscal Policy
19.
In light of the persistently large external imbalances, authorities and staff
concurred that there was no scope to relax the ambitious surplus target for this year.
There was also concurrence that further tightening of fiscal policy would come from the
adjustor embedded in the program rather than from discretionary policy action. In this regard,
preliminary information for January to April suggests strong collections and some revenue
overperformance for the year as a whole. If realized, the projected revenue overperformance
relative to target—0.4 percent of GDP—would imply an upward revision to the surplus target
of 0.2 percent of GDP under the adjustor, to 3.2 percent of GDP (¶4), providing some offset
to strong private demand.
20.
With broad agreement on the near-term stance of fiscal policy, discussions
focused on policies in 2007 and beyond. Staff stressed the competing objectives and
challenges for fiscal policy in coming years:
•

Avoiding a large relaxation in the fiscal stance given persistently strong domestic
demand pressures and large external vulnerabilities.

•

Making maximum use of the available EU post-accession grants, within an overall
prudent expenditure envelope, while taking into account significant fiscal costs
associated with accession.

•

Increasing the transparency of budget preparation and execution.

21.
Staff noted that EU accession would complicate fiscal management in 2007 and
beyond (Box 5). While the availability of sizeable post-accession grants from the EU would
be a one-time opportunity to help lay the foundations for more rapid integration and
convergence with the EU, the fiscal impact of accession needed to be carefully managed lest
it result in an excessive fiscal expansion.11 Also, with the diminished role of the credit
restraints (see below), the role of fiscal policy as a short-run demand management tool would
become more critical. The authorities broadly agreed with this assessment, but underlined the
uncertainties behind some of the estimates of accession-related financial flows to Bulgaria
(¶5) as well as uncertainty about the country’s absorptive capacity.
22.
Taking these considerations into account, the authorities and staff agreed that a
fiscal surplus of around 2 percent of GDP in 2007 would be appropriate. The authorities

13
noted that this echoed advice from the EC. Based on the authorities’ initial estimate of the
cost of accession, amounting to about 2½ percent of GDP (Box 5), expenditure
savings/substitution of about 0.6 percent of GDP would be needed to reach the 2 percent
surplus target.
23.
In light of the near-term challenges, staff argued that the government’s proposal
to cut direct taxes needed to await clear evidence that they could be afforded. The
proposals were to: (i) reduce the corporate income tax rate from 15 percent to 12 percent; and
(ii) eliminate the middle tax bracket in the personal income tax and increase the nontaxable
income threshold. The total cost of these measures is estimated at about 0.6 percent of
projected 2007 GDP. The authorities agreed to reconsider these proposals in the autumn (¶5),
but stressed their intention to maintain a tax system with low rates and few exemptions in the
context of a continued shift away from direct taxation. They agreed with staff that future tax
cuts should give priority to reducing the payroll tax rate, which remains high relative to other
tax rates even after this year’s welcome reduction. Staff pointed out that further
improvements in tax administration are necessary, particularly to ensure that tax and social
security contributions become fully integrated within the NRA as early as possible.
24.
Staff argued that Bulgaria needed to move toward standards of fiscal
transparency consistent with its prospective status as an EU member state. Recalling the
conclusions of the 2005 fiscal ROSC, staff pressed the authorities to present the 2007 budget
with realistic fiscal projections. The practice of providing parliament with underestimated
revenue and the ability under current budget laws to spend a significant part of the eventual
revenue overperformance undermined parliamentary scrutiny of government activities. The
authorities concurred, and are planning on a 2007 budget with a realistic revenue projection
(¶9). They also committed to provide more information with their budget submission, and to
strengthen public procurement procedures.
25.
Although medium-term public debt sustainability is not at issue, the public
sector needs to continue to provide an offset to private sector savings-investment
imbalances. As such imbalances are

14
the CBA or following prospective EMU participation, this cautious medium-term stance
would secure room for fiscal maneuver during cyclical downturns. Staff also stressed that
substantial expenditure substitution would be necessary in order to make room for EU project
grants without undue fiscal relaxation. Looking beyond the initial post-accession years,
however, Bulgaria should anticipate spending needs in priority areas such as infrastructure
and education, warranting a build-up of public finance capacity in the interim. The
authorities broadly concurred with these recommendations, noting that this fiscal restraint
was consistent with the 40 percent of GDP ceiling on general government expenditure set in
the post-election coalition agreement.
26.
Staff underlined the need for further fiscal reforms to solidify the foundation for
public finances. The authorities noted their commitment to reduce fraud and abuse, noting
that the law on duty-free trade—which specifies limits on individual purchases of goods and
fuels and strengthened controls—is expected to be passed by parliament by August 31, 2006
(¶8). Staff also emphasized the need for improvements in expenditure management, in part to
ensure a high degree of absorption of EU funds within a prudent overall expenditure
envelope. The authorities pointed to the deployment of the Financial Management
Information System in the Ministry of Finance, which is designed to help manage
expenditure, and noted that program budgeting was being introduced in additional ministries
(¶9). Furthermore, local government debt operations would be more closely monitored
through the establishment of a municipal debt register (¶18).
27.
Reform of public services is a priority. Absent wide ranging and fundamental
reform, the health and education sectors would continue to provide poor value for money,
while putting rising pressure on public expenditure. In the health sector, staff stressed that
near-term plans to tighten financial controls and increase the transparency of hospital
financing would need to be bolstered by extensive restructuring and consolidation of the
hospital sector. In the education sector, the authorities noted that a reform strategy—setting
out broad objectives in terms of improving outcomes and rationalizing school and staff
numbers in the context of a falling student population—had been submitted to parliament
(¶6). Staff encouraged the authorities to make headway in these difficult areas—with the
assistance of the World Bank—following years of disappointing progress.
C. Financial Sector Policies
28.
There was agreement that the bank credit growth limits were rapidly losing
effectiveness and should be phased out. The authorities noted that banks had generally
observed the limits and that bank lending growth to the non-government sector had declined
as projected since their introduction in March 2005. However, there was mounting evidence
that the impact on financial flows and demand was fading as both business and households
were increasingly finding alternative means of obtaining credit. Staff also agreed with the
BNB that the measures were distorting credit allocation decisions and reducing the central
bank’s ability to reliably monitor changes to credit quality.

15
29.
The authorities plan to phase out the measures in a manner that minimizes
disruption to the financial system. The BNB said it was not committed to a particular time
schedule but noted its intention to Text Figure 4. Bulgaria: Growth of Bank Credit

from 400 to 200 percent from August 4, 2006. The BNB also announced that it was
broadening requirements on banks for reporting to the credit registry to include third party
loans that they manage.
30.
Staff stressed that the existing tight prudential framework for banks should be
maintained. Although the banking system is well capitalized and profitable, its health had
been supported by propitious operating conditions, including robust economic growth and
high global liquidity. There was agreement that although the NPL ratio remained broadly
stable, the lagging nature of the indicator could possibly mask a latent deterioration of the
quality of loan portfolios. Moreover, discussions with market participants suggest that the
creditworthiness of new borrowers may be falling. However, the BNB’s stress tests—which
staff views as appropriately conservative—suggest that the banking system is well-positioned
to absorb a significant adverse shock. The authorities also noted that they are carefully
monitoring developments in classified loans, taking note of staff’s research showing that
Bulgarian-owned banks in particular exhibited greater solvency risk.12 They also intend to
implement a conservative version of Basel II from January 1, 2007 (¶13) but cautioned that
overly stringent prudential regulations would likely promote regulatory arbitrage, especially
with the opening of the domestic banking sector to foreign bank branches under the EU’s
Single Passport directive following accession.

Chapter 4 of Selected Issues.

16
31.
The authorities acknowledged the need to improve the supervision of the rapidly
growing non-bank financial sector (¶15). They agreed with staff that, while the systemic
risk posed by this sector is small, the increased shifting of credit risk from the banks to their
non-bank financial counterparts, along with associated reputation risk, is an area of potential
concern. To address this risk, the authorities have submitted to parliament a law on
supervision of financial conglomerates, and the social insurance code was amended in
February 2006. On the issue of insurance sector supervision, an MFD TA mission overlapped
with the Article IV consultation and made a number of recommendations to strengthen
prudential and market conduct regulation in the sector (¶16).
D. Incomes and Labor Market Policies
32.
Staff stressed that a prudent incomes policy and efforts to increase labor market
flexibility would be critical to maintain the competitiveness and agility of the economy.
In view of proposals from trade unions and some in the government for significant increases
in public sector pay and the minimum wage, staff cautioned that more modest increases this
year and next would send appropriate signals to businesses and workers to avoid excessive
pay rises. Staff also pointed out that higher wages in the public sector could be better
afforded if excess labor were cut. With respect to private sector wage determination, staff
stressed that wages should be set in the market according to productivity improvements and
other factors at the firm level. The authorities concurred with staff’s observations on labor
market flexibility, and intend to increase working time flexibility and eliminate the
portability of the seniority bonus when changing jobs (¶11). Staff also stressed that
Bulgaria’s adverse demographics highlight the need to increase labor market participation,
and encouraged the authorities to review social assistance programs, including for sick leave,
to ensure that disincentives to participation are minimized.
E. Other Structural Reforms
33.
Staff emphasized that a revitalization of structural reforms was needed to
improve medium-term growth prospects and help address external vulnerabilities.
Although a number of fundamental reforms were undertaken in the years following the
creation of the CBA, the momentum has slowed in recent years. With external vulnerabilities
remaining significant even in a benign scenario, and with macroeconomic policies having
reached their limit in terms of efficacy and feasibility, staff emphasized that the policy
burden would increasingly shift to the structural side to elicit a supply response from the
economy. Absent a more forceful approach to structural reform implementation, staff warned
that convergence to EU living standards would be even more prolonged and that Bulgaria
would not be sufficiently agile to benefit fully from EMU. The authorities acknowledged that
differences within the coalition government had delayed the formulation of clear strategies
for structural reform. However, they agreed on the importance of removing remaining
impediments to investment and growth, including the following priority areas put forward by
staff:

17
•

Further efforts to improve the business climate, including: completing reforms to
transform business registration from a judicial to an administrative procedure (¶19),
further lifting the regulatory burden on businesses (¶21), strengthening the quality of
public services, and improving public infrastructure.

•

Re-establish momentum in the areas of privatization and concession agreements,
which have tended to get mired in court proceedings or delayed for other reasons
(¶20).

•

The decline in corruption seen earlier has slowed down, and implementation of the
government’s anti-corruption strategy (¶22) has fallen short of its objectives. Here,
determined implementation of the anti-corruption agenda agreed in response to the
latest European Commission monitoring report, along with improvements in public
procurement procedures, will be important.
F. Program Issues

34.
Discussions on the third review focused on measures in the remainder of 2006 to
reduce external vulnerabilities and get the structural program back on track. Staff and
authorities concurred that the further widening of the external current account deficit meant
there was no scope for a fiscal loosening this year. Understandings were also reached on a
revised timeline for structural actions.
35.
Quantitative PCs remain on track (Table 11), but there have been numerous
slippages in structural conditionality (Table 12). The three measures set as structural PCs
for end-April and end-June are expected to be implemented partially or with delay, and
waivers are sought for the following items below (LOI, ¶2):
•

Approval of the new VAT law by parliament is a Prior Action, following a delay
from the April 30, 2006 deadline set in the second review due to extended
consultations with the business community.

•

Because of the need to develop new software for electronic registration, the start-up
of the new business register is now proposed as an October 1, 2006 structural PC, a
three month delay from the June 30, 2006 deadline set in the second review.

•

The selection of the winning bidder for the Varna electricity generation company was
implemented on schedule. Lacking an acceptable bid for the Rousse plant, the tender
for its sale has been re-issued, and the selection of the winning bidder is proposed as
an October 31, 2006 structural PC.

36.
Relative to the second review, there are a number of other proposed changes to
program conditionality outlined in Table 13. In recent weeks, the authorities have stepped
up efforts in the structural area, including progress toward passage of a new duty-free trade

18
law, amendment of the labor code increasing work-time flexibility, submission to parliament
of laws on credit institutions and financial conglomerates, and amendment of the law on
investment promotion to speed up administrative processes.
37.
The authorities have requested an extension of the SBA until March 2007 (LOI,
¶4), noting that a short extension of the arrangement would help mobilize political
support for prudent policies through end-year. Staff supports this request. In light of the
proposed extension, preliminary agreement was reached on the outline of the budget
for 2007. While specific discussions of the parameters of the 2007 budget will await the
fourth review mission, staff and authorities concurred that understandings on the budget will
be an important element of that review. The authorities have also requested a waiver of
applicability for the end-June performance criteria on the general government balance,
central government arrears and the wage bill of 58 state-owned enterprises. Data to verify
performance against these targets will not be available by the August 2 Board date, but
information received thus far suggest that these are likely to be met.
G. Other Issues
38.

The authorities and staff also discussed the following issues:

•

The legislative framework for AML/CFT is largely in place. The authorities stressed
their commitment to strengthening enforcement (¶17). Bulgaria’s AML/CFT system
is to be evaluated by MONEYVAL later in 2006.

•

The BNB has an infrastructure disruption plan that would be invoked in the event of
an outbreak of avian flu in the population. Commercial banks for the most part have
developed business continuity plans.

•

Data provision and quality remain sufficient for program monitoring and
surveillance. The authorities are nevertheless committed to further improve the
quality of statistics.

•

Bulgaria’s trade regime will be further liberalized when the country joins the
EU. The current simple average MFN tariff of 11.8 percent will be halved upon EU
accession. Trade in services, notably financial services, will be further liberalized
under the EU single passport regime.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL

39.
Bulgaria’s successful transition from crisis a decade ago to steady growth has
helped the country reach the doorstep of EU accession. The confidence inspired by
Bulgaria’s economic performance and expectations of convergence to European living
standards has spurred consumption as well as investment flows from abroad. This has
contributed to strong growth, buoyed by rapid investment growth, and falling unemployment.

19
Wage increases have remained broadly in line with productivity growth and have helped to
maintain competitiveness. Capitalizing further on accession will require maintaining sound
macroeconomic policies and an acceleration of structural reforms to enhance the
performance and agility of the economy.
40.
Growth has been accompanied, however, by a worrying increase in Bulgaria’s
external vulnerability. Buoyant domestic demand, fueled in part by rapid bank credit
growth, has contributed to the recent increase in inflation and has boosted imports. The
consequent widening of the current account deficit has been rapid and substantial. Although
competitiveness appears to be satisfactory and the export outlook is reassuring, the already
high and rising external debt level makes Bulgaria vulnerable to external shocks, including
the risks inherent in a less benign global economic and financing environment.
41.
The authorities’ plan to retain the currency board at the present parity through
to euro adoption is appropriate. Staff considers the exchange rate broadly in line with
fundamentals, but it will be crucial that the policy framework is conducive to maintaining
going forward and euro adoption is likely to reduce external vulnerabilities and also
accelerate the process of integration with the EU. As the lev is already pegged rigidly to the
euro, Bulgaria only stands to gain by joining EMU at the earliest feasible date.
42.
The progressive tightening of fiscal policy has provided a strong signal of the
government’s commitment to contain macroeconomic imbalances. Substantial fiscal
surpluses have helped to offset strong private sector demand, and with the current account
deficit projected to remain high over the near term, the government's commitment to a fiscal
surplus of at least 3 percent of GDP in 2006 is appropriate. With revenue performance
presently expected to exceed earlier projections, application of the fiscal adjustor agreed
under the program will yield a slightly higher surplus.
43.
With external vulnerabilities likely to unwind slowly in coming years, there is
only limited room to relax fiscal policy. For 2007, the budget should aim to achieve a
surplus of at least 2 percent of GDP. As financial flows associated with EU accession will
add to demand pressures, achieving this budget objective will require the identification of
offsetting expenditure savings and substitution. In addition, although the EU-financed
projects can also add greatly to Bulgaria's productive capacity, they will raise potential
output growth only if they are planned carefully and managed properly. This requires urgent
improvements to administrative capacity.
44.
Bulgaria needs to improve standards of fiscal transparency. Purposefully underbudgeting revenue or over-stating spending plans distorts budgetary decisions and
undermines parliamentary scrutiny of government activities. Such non-transparent practices
undermine the government’s credibility and provide confusing signals about fiscal policy,
with potential adverse consequences for investor sentiment. There is also urgent need to
improve public procurement and expenditure management—including internal controls,

20
accounting, auditing and budget execution reporting—especially in light of the prospective
EU project grants.
45.
The government has wisely opted to delay decisions on further tax cuts. Tax
policy and administration should focus on reducing distortions and incentives to operate in
the grey economy. Despite the significant reduction of social security contribution rates
in 2006, taxes on labor remain high, promoting the underground economy. Thus, to the
extent that further tax cuts can be afforded, they should be directed towards payroll taxes.
There is still much scope for improvements in tax administration, particularly by ensuring
that tax and social security collections are fully integrated within the National Revenue
Agency as early as possible.
46.
Risks to the banking sector in an environment of rapid credit growth need to be
monitored closely. Although the banking system is well capitalized and profitable,
supervisors need to scrutinize developments in non-performing loans and ensure the
adequacy of banks' risk management frameworks. The credit limits introduced by the BNB
helped reduce excessive growth in bank lending, but their effectiveness has diminished as
banks found means of circumvention. The BNB's plan to phase out the administrative credit
measures while maintaining the existing tight prudential framework is therefore appropriate.
47.
The insurance and pension sectors are growing rapidly and require close
supervision. Although the systemic risk posed by the non-bank financial sector remains
small at this stage, reputation risks to the wider financial sector may exist.
48.
A revitalization of structural reforms is needed to improve medium-term growth
prospects and help address external vulnerabilities. A more flexible and dynamic
economy will yield stronger growth, increase resilience to shocks, and help export
performance by sustaining competitiveness. It will also improve prospects for success within
the monetary union. However, following a period of profound economic restructuring
following adoption of the CBA, the reform momentum has slowed over time. Although the
legislative framework has been strengthened in a number of areas, implementation on the
ground remains the weak link. Particular areas requiring attention include:
•

Efforts to improve the business environment and encourage foreign and domestic
investment need to be accelerated. The judicial system does not yet deliver the needed
standards of legal certainty, the burden of regulation remains onerous, and public
administration remains slow and unresponsive to the needs of businesses.

•

Privatization and concession arrangements need to be sped up.

•

Public infrastructure needs to be modernized and renovated.

•

Labor market participation needs to be increased to counter Bulgaria's adverse
demographic prospects. This will require a review of social assistance programs,

21
including sick leave, to ensure that disincentives to labor market participation are
minimized. Release of excess staff from the public sector would also contribute to
improved labor supply to the private sector. The government needs to work with its
social partners to ensure implementation of its initiatives to improve labor market
flexibility.
•

In the critical social sectors of health and education, more vigorous reform efforts are
needed. The education system needs to be rationalized in light of demographics and
skills demands of the economy. Health care financing needs urgent reform to reduce
the burden on public finances.

49.
Corruption remains a serious problem. The declining trend in corruption reported
since the late 1990s appears to have come to an end, and implementation of the government's
anti-corruption strategy has fallen short of its objectives. Improvements to public
procurement procedures would help in this regard, as will legislative initiatives such as the
expected new duty-free trade law. But results in the fight against corruption will depend
ultimately on the political will of the government, parliament and other institutions.
50.
Failure to maintain firm fiscal policy and re-invigorate the structural reform
agenda would make Bulgaria increasingly vulnerable to shocks. Large and persistent
external imbalances, together with rapid credit growth and rising inflation, give rise to
sizeable risks. To avoid a scenario of deteriorating competitiveness, low growth and high
debt, and the consequent disorderly adjustment of domestic absorption, it will be imperative
for the authorities to be resolute in implementing policies that contain these underlying risks
and increase the flexibility of the economy.
51.
Staff recommends completion of the Third Review under the SBA, and supports the
authorities’ requests for waivers of non-observance and of applicability of performance
criteria, and for an extension of the arrangement to March 31, 2007. It further proposes that,
consistent with provisions of decision 12794-(02/76) Bulgaria revert to a 12-month
Article IV consultation cycle upon expiration of the SBA.

22
Box 1. International Competitiveness
The rapid widening in the external current account deficit in 2005 has raised concerns about
Bulgaria’s international competitiveness. As with any transition economy, however, it is difficult to
disentangle the structural and cyclical effects: a larger current account deficit may reflect consumption
smoothing and catch-up effects, rather than a loss of competitiveness. Similarly, an appreciation of the real
effective exchange rate (REER) may reflect underlying changes in the equilibrium exchange rate.
An analysis of standard indicators suggests that there has not been a significant loss in external
competitiveness.
REER indicators: CPI- and PPI-based REERs show a trend appreciation since 2000, which is to be
expected in a transition

Romania and the NMS8 (see Figure 3, panel 1). The ULC-based REER (manufacturing sector) has
shown a trend depreciation, although it appreciated modestly in 2005. However, wage levels in
Bulgaria remain far below other transition countries, and this differential did not change appreciably
in 2005 (Figure 3, panel 2). In addition, the divergent trends in the price- and cost-based REERs
suggest strong growth in corporate profitability.

Box 2. Implementation of Past IMF Policy Recommendations
Fiscal policy: Bulgaria has maintained a very cautious stance of fiscal policy in support of the CBA,
in line with staff recommendations. Sustained and increasing primary surpluses have allowed
continued reductions of gross external public debt. Fiscal transparency is improving, but further steps
are necessary in this area in line with ROSC recommendations.
Financial sector issues: There has been good collaboration on measures to reduce bank credit
growth, and the authorities have been receptive to Fund advice on strengthening financial sector
soundness. Implementation of the 2002 FSAP banking sector recommendations has been strong;
further progress is needed in the non-banking sector. The authorities have expressed an interest in a
follow-up during the latter part of 2007.
Structural reforms: After several years of vigorous efforts following the 1996-97 crisis, the
structural reform momentum slowed. There has been agreement on the reform agenda, including staff
recommendations in areas such as privatization, tax administration, business registration and dispute
resolution and enforcement, but implementation has been slow.

will soon fall, and the labor contribution to growth will shrink. In order to sustain higher economic
growth and achieve faster catch-up, Bulgaria needs to raise its labor force participation rate and
increase overall productivity through further structural reforms.
Given the large initial income gap, it will take Bulgaria several decades to converge to the living
standards of the more advanced members of the EU, even with optimistic assumptions
regarding economic growth. At market exchange rates, Bulgaria’s GDP per capita is only about one
tenth of the average of EU15 and less than half of the average of the new member states. Adjusted for
purchasing power parity, Bulgaria’s GDP per capita is a little more than ¼ of the EU15 average. Even
with optimistic assumptions, it would take Bulgaria more than 20 years to reach the current level of
average per capita income of EU15. Assuming absolute convergence and allowing EU15 to converge
to its steady state, it is estimated that it will take Bulgaria more than 40 years to reach ¾ of the
average income level of the EU15.

26
Box 4. Assessing Near-Term Risks
While underlying medium-term vulnerabilities are significant, risks of a near-term crisis appear low.
Bulgaria continues to enjoy strong liquidity buffers, and the focus on only a few indicators—such as the external
current account deficit—in isolation, rather than on a broader set of macro-prudential indicators, may be
misleading.

One recent approach to crisis
prediction uses an empirical decision tree, which allows individual vulnerabilities to interact with others
so as to identify different types of risks (see IMF WP/05/42). An analysis of a set of macro-prudential
indicators and associated thresholds that have been shown to be statistically significant in predicting
sovereign debt defaults and recourse to large-scale IMF assistance suggests that Bulgaria is not at
present crisis prone. The tree begins with the external debt-to-GDP ratio (threshold of 50 percent), and
then splits in a binary fashion, depending on actual data compared to certain threshold values, until a
country is identified as either safe or crisis prone (see below for Bulgaria).

With relatively low public external debt levels, a sovereign debt crisis may not be the most likely crisis
scenario in Bulgaria. However, in the event of problems in the financial sector, there could be important
spillover effects. Specifically, in the case of a banking crisis, although the BNB’s stress tests indicate
that banks are well-placed to absorb high levels of stress,1 liquidity and solvency risks for the sovereign
could materialize rather quickly.

Box 5. Fiscal Impact of EU Accession 1/
Upon EU accession, Bulgaria will begin to benefit from substantial EU transfers. These
transfers—which come in addition to those Bulgaria has already been receiving through the preaccession financial instruments PHARE, ISPA, and SAPARD—offer a unique opportunity to
hasten economic, social, and institutional integration with the EU. Annual post-accession transfers
to Bulgaria’s budget are estimated to average around 2 percent of GDP during 2007-09, although
the precise amount will ultimately depend on Bulgaria’s ability to identify projects and
demonstrate capacity to use these funds effectively.
However, other fiscal effects of accession will complicate fiscal management. Revenue is
boosted by the EU transfers, but so is expenditure. Indeed, costs related to accession—which
include the contribution to the EU budget (net of some compensatory payments designed to
prevent a negative cash flow for Bulgaria), revenue losses arising from the elimination of customs
borders with the EU, and cofinancing requirements—are estimated to total 2½ percent of GDP in
2007. On top of this comes the grant-financed project spending.
In order to prevent an excessive loosening in the fiscal stance, expenditure
savings/substitution will be necessary. In 2007, EU post-accession net transfers to the budget are
negligibly small. 2/ Other factors as listed in the table below are estimated to produce a negative
impact on the budget of 2.6 percent of GDP. Absent offsetting expenditure savings, this would
produce a 1.4 percent of GDP surplus in 2007, which, given the continued increase in external
vulnerabilities, would be excessively expansionary relative to the targeted surplus of 3.2 percent
of GDP in 2006. However, with expenditure savings or substitution of 0.6 percent of GDP a
surplus of 2 percent of GDP is attainable.

Sources: Bulgarian authorities, and Fund staff estimates.

1/ All FDI are assumed to be non-debt creating in the projections.
2/ The figures for 2004 and 2005 are influenced by a complex debt financed merger and acquisition transaction of a local mobile telephone
company that led to a sharp increase in its equity value, and a transfer of the realized capital gains out of the country by the original owners. This resulted in a net
FDI outflow of 650 million euros and an increase in gross external debt by 590 million euros in 2004.
3/ Privatization receipts for the electricity distribution companies are included in 2005. These are included in the receipts for 2004 in the balance of payments presentation of
the BNB. The present treatment aligns them with its receipt in the fiscal accounts.
4/ According to expectations schedule.
5/ Historical numbers include valuation changes. From 2006-10 includes reserves posted as a guarantee for defense related purchases. Reserve coverage ratios are calculated net
of impaired reserves.
6/ Gross international reserves minus reserve money. For 2006-08, reserves posted as a guarantee for defense related purchases are excluded.
7/ Projections include assumptions on disbursements related to debt not already contracted.
8/ External debt minus gross foreign assets of the banking system.

1/ In late 2004, a state enterprise for infrastructure projects ("PIP") was created, capitalized with BGN 340 million to execute
spending in 2005. PIP is consolidated with the general government.
2/ Pension and unemployment contributions were combined in January 2002.
3/ From 2004, total expenditure is adjusted for variation of arrears (net). Net variation in arrears amounted to BGN -84.7 million and
BGN 8.2 million in 2004 and 2005, respectively.
4/ Includes additional compulsory social security contributions (for the second pillar of the pension system) for public sector employees.
5/ Under the 2003 and 2004 budgets, these transfers were envisaged to be made below the line for various purposes.
6/ Slight differences between privatization receipts in the balance of payments and the fiscal accounts are due to domestic privatization.
In 2004, however, about BGN 500 million (1.3 percent of GDP) of previously completed bank privatizations was transferred to the
government upon the closure of the Bank Consolidation Company.

GDP
Sources: Bulgarian authorities, and Fund staff estimates.

1/ All FDI are assumed to be non-debt creating in the projections.
2/ The figures for 2004 and 2005 are influenced by a complex debt financed merger and acquisition transaction of a local mobile telephone
company that led to a sharp increase in its equity value, and a transfer of the realized capital gains out of the country by the original owners. This resulted in a net
FDI outflow of 650 million euros and an increase in gross external debt by 590 million euros in 2004.
3/ Privatization receipts for the electricity distribution companies are included in 2005. These are included in the receipts for 2004 in the balance of payments presentation of
the BNB. The present treatment aligns them with its receipt in the fiscal accounts.
4/ According to expectations schedule.
5/ Historical numbers include valuation changes. From 2006-10 includes reserves posted as a guarantee for defense related purchases. Reserve coverage ratios are calculated net
of impaired reserves.
6/ Current account adjustment is facilitated by average net EU transfers over 2008-11 that are 1.8 percentage points of GDP higher than the 2006 level.
7/ Projections include assumptions on disbursements related to debt not already contracted.
8/ External debt minus gross foreign assets of the banking system.

The privatization of the Varna electricity generating company was
completed on April 24, 2006. The privatization of Rousse power
plant was blocked by the decision of Commission for Protection of
Competition. In February 2006, the Privatization Agency cancelled
the procedure as the bid from the second bidder was unsatisfactory.
A new tender is expected to be issued by July 25, 2006.

The draft law was approved by CoM on March 30, 2006. It was
submitted to Parliament on April 12, 2006. On April 27, 2006, the
draft was passed in second reading by the budget commission.

The strategy was submitted to parliament on March 27, 2006,
however, with no explicit mention of the envisaged 5,500 job cuts.

Draft amendments to the Labor Code envisaging raising the
maximum working hours under labor contracts from 40 to 48 hours
per week were adopted by the National Tripartite Council on March
16, 2006. The draft did not include the lengthening of the working
time calculation period, which was later introduced in parliament
and agreed by social partners on May 18, 2006.

Notes

The amendment to the Labor Code to increase the limit on working
hours from 40 to 48 hours per week, increase working time
calculation period from 4 to 6 months was approved by parliament
on May 31, 2006.

Decision to transform the Road Executive Agency into an
extrabudgetary fund has been made. The agency will be established
in January 2007.

ε = nominal appreciation (increase in euro value of domestic currency), and α = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include seven year averages of real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; euro deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, euro deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of euro).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.

Safeguards Assessment:

Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) was
subject to an assessment with respect to the SBA which was approved on February 27,
2002. The assessment, which was completed on June 12, 2002, identified certain
weaknesses and made appropriate recommendations, as reported in IMF Country Report
No. 02/174. An updated assessment, which was conducted with respect to the current
SBA and completed on November 23, 2004, found that the BNB’s financial statements
had been improved and earlier audit qualifications eliminated, the scope of the internal
audit function had been widened and a risk-based audit methodology had been
introduced. No major vulnerabilities in the safeguards framework were identified. The
mission’s recommendations to further solidify Bulgaria’s safeguards are being
implemented.
VIII.

Exchange Arrangement:

An amendment to the Law on the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) effectively established
a currency board arrangement from July 1, 1997. The deutsche mark was chosen at par as
the peg currency, which has since been replaced with the euro at the rate of lev 1.95583
per € 1. The BNB is buying and selling euros in noncash transactions at the parity rate. In
cash transactions it levies a commission of 0.5 percent on the selling side. Bulgaria has
accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of
Agreement, and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making
of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
IX.

Article IV Consultation:

The last Article IV consultation was concluded on June 14, 2004 (see IMF Country
Report No. 04/176). Bulgaria is on a 24-month cycle. The Acting Chairman’s summingup of the discussion was circulated as SUR/04/60.
X.

FSAP Participation and ROSCs:

Bulgaria participated in an FSAP held from October 29 to November 14, 2001. A followup to the FSAP update was conducted as part of the 2004 Article IV consultation mission.

APPENDIX II. BULGARIA: IMF-WORLD BANK RELATIONS
A. Partnership in Bulgaria’s Development Strategy
1.
The government’s economic program has been underpinned by a conservative fiscal
policy and significant progress with structural reforms. So far Bulgaria has made substantial
progress towards long-term macroeconomic stability—an important step along the way to its
ultimate goals of improving living standards and accession to the EU. The successful EU
integration hinges on the continuing challenge of macroeconomic stability in the context of
the Currency Board Arrangement (CBA), sustaining structural reforms and establishing a
business environment conducive to growth, together with improved governance, a deeper
financial system, and investment in human capital and physical infrastructure.
2.
The IMF has been leading in supporting Bulgaria’s medium-term program in
maintaining macroeconomic stability. Building on the achievements of the three-year
Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement and a follow-up two-year Stand-By Arrangement
(SBA). The IMF Board approved, in August 2004, a 25-month precautionary SBA (ending
September 2006) in an amount of SDR100 million.
3.
The World Bank has been leading the policy dialogue in structural and institutional
reforms aimed at (i) promoting competitive private sector-led growth; (ii) strengthening
market institutions and improving both corporate and public sector governance; and (iii)
mitigating the social impact of restructuring and delivering social services more effectively.
On June 13, 2006 the Board of Directors discussed the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)
of the Bank which outlined the roadmap for the Bank’s country support for the period 07-09.
In addition to the Bank’s ongoing lending operations in areas such as health, child welfare,
water, trade and transport, environment, the CPS includes a three-year development policy
lending (DPL) program of three DPLs of up to US$150 million each, as well as investment
lending in road and municipal infrastructure, trade and transport facilitation for South East
Europe, social inclusion, regional development. The Bank continues to undertake
substantive country diagnostics providing a solid base for policy dialogue and design and
implementation of its lending operations in Bulgaria.
B. IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
4.
In general, the Bank has the lead on the dialogue on the core structural aspects of the
reforms while the Fund has the lead on the dialogue on the macroeconomic, typically fiscal,
aspects of the reforms. There are a number of areas where the IMF leads and its analyses
serve as inputs into World Bank policy formulation and advice, including policies to
maintain macroeconomic stability, fiscal policies, income policies and external sector
policies. There are other areas in which the Bank and the Fund share responsibility and are
coordinating closely their policy advice to the Bulgarian authorities such as in the financial
sector, public expenditure management and budgeting, and tax administration. In some areas,
the Bank has taken the lead but its analysis, country diagnostic work, and policy
recommendations served as inputs into the Fund’s policy advice on the fiscal front such as
education, health care, pensions, social protection, energy, and railways. In areas such as
private sector development, strengthening market institutions (including entry and exit

62
policies, regulatory reform to enhance the business climate, judicial reform, labor market
reform), and improving governance the Bank has the lead. In addition to consultations early
in the process of formulating and adjusting each institution’s program with Bulgaria, the
Bank and Fund staff teams interact extensively during the review of the progress achieved in
the country and coordinate closely their policy advice to the Bulgarian authorities.
B.1. Areas where the IMF leads and its analyses serve as inputs into the World Bank
policy formulation and advice.
5.
To achieve the objectives of their economic program, the Bulgarian authorities are
fully committed to maintain sound and flexible macroeconomic policies centered on a
Currency Board Arrangement (CBA) and implement an ambitious reform agenda. In
particular, the authorities have maintained a tight fiscal policy since 1998, attaining a surplus
of 2.4 percent of GDP in 2005. The aim is to have three percent surplus in 2005, conduct
fiscal policy flexibly in the face of shocks, and maintain a high level of fiscal reserve assets.
Given the constraints of the CBA, the authorities see labor market policies as another key
component of the broad policy strategy. A strict incomes policy for the state enterprise sector
is enforced and measures aimed at facilitating the adjustment of labor markets are being
implemented. The structural and institutional reforms, which constitute the third pillar of the
policy strategy, are focused on a competitor market economy that is competitive and can
flexibly adjust to shocks.
6.
In the context of a 25-month Stand-By Arrangement that was approved in August
2004, the IMF continued to lead in assisting Bulgaria in safeguarding macroeconomic
stability and promoting structural reforms in areas that are macro-critical and fall within the
Fund's core expertise. To safeguard the CBA and ensure that it can continue to serve as the
macroeconomic policy anchor, the IMF set a floor on the size of the overall surplus of the
general government and a ceiling on central government arrears. To prevent threats to the
currency board and macroeconomic stability that could arise from a loss in competitiveness
or excessive external financing requirements, Fund conditionality also included ceilings on
the wage bill of those state enterprises that have the largest losses and arrears, are
monopolies, and receive subsidies, and on the contracting and guaranteeing of public sector
external debt.
B.2.

Areas of shared responsibility.

Financial Sector. In late 2001, staff of the two institutions carried out a joint IMFWorld Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) for Bulgaria, providing a shared
perspective on the development agenda of the country and on the prioritization and
sequencing of reforms in the financial sector. Key findings of the FSAP have been
conditionalities on financial sector policies under both the SBA and the PAL program. The
IMF has emphasized aspects related to the banking sector—mainly on policies under the
mandate of BNB and supervisory agencies—while the World Bank has focused on policies
that affect market performance and development of the financial sector such as improving the
legal and institutional framework for lending, restructuring of the banking sector,
strengthening creditor rights, corporate insolvency and governance, and non-banking

63
financial sector issues. A follow-up to the FSAP was undertaken by Fund staff in the context
of the 2004 Article IV consultation mission in March–April 2004.
8.
Since 1997, in the context of two Finance and Enterprise Adjustment Loans
(FESALs), and with the PAL program, the Bank has supported the government in sector
restructuring of the financial sector. Privatization of commercial banks was a major
component of the FESALs, while the Fund provided support for the institution building
efforts of the BNB and its Banking Supervision Department in particular. In the financial
sector, the Bank focused on banking, insurance, pension funds, and capital markets while the
Fund continued its focus on the BNB, banking supervision, and the payments system.
9.
Revenue Administration. The IMF and the World Bank have been carrying out a
joint effort since 1996 to assist Bulgaria in reforms aimed at the establishment of an efficient
revenue collection agency. Diagnostics consistently pointed to revenue collection
deficiencies including weak management, and problematic audit and enforcement of
collection, which in turn facilitates low compliance. Supporting reform efforts, the World
Bank implemented a project to modernize the Social Security Institute, including its revenue
collection activities. The IMF provided a long-term advisor to the Ministry of Finance, and
focused advisory services through consulting assignments. Joint World Bank-IMF efforts
resulted in a proposal for “Implementing a Modern Revenue Collection Agency” in March
2000, which is moving forward. The World Bank’s Board approved on June 5, 2003 the
Revenue Administration Reform Project (RARP, €31.9 million), developed with technical
assistance of the IMF, to support the establishment of the national revenue agency (NRA),
which seeks to maximize the level of voluntary taxpayer compliance, promote effectiveness
and efficiency, establish a professional workforce and approach to collection, and help
reduce the scope for corruption.
10.
Public Expenditure Management. The Bank has taken the lead in the dialogue on
the efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditures and has outlined policy directions in
the context of the Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR)14 of 2002, and the
recently completed Public Finance Policy Review.
11.
The IMF has provided long-term technical assistance on budgeting and expenditure
management. To ensure the fiscal discipline necessary to support the CBA, the government
has initiated a number of public expenditure management reforms. New budget procedures
were introduced in early 2002 and were implemented for the 2003 budget. Despite this
important progress, there is a need to continue and broaden the reform effort—capital
expenditure proposals should be prepared under hard budget constraints and as an integral
part of the medium-term budget frameworks; and the financial management at the local level
should be strengthened.

B.3. Areas where the World Bank leads and its analyses serve as inputs into the IMF
policy formulation and advice.
12.
Energy sector. The Bank has played the lead role in assisting the government in the
design of the reform program in the sector, and more importantly in its implementation.
Under the PAL program, the government strengthened the legal and regulatory framework,
removed major price distortions and initiated steps to enable the private sector to assume an
increasing share of commercial risks. In June 2003 the Bank’s Board approved two district
heating projects to support the rehabilitation of the Sofia and the Pernik District Heating
Companies. The Fund’s and the Bank’s teams have worked collaboratively in close
consultations with the government, and the previous SBA included a performance criterion
focusing on implementation of the schedule for bringing electricity prices to full cost
recovery level, and two benchmarks—one on implementation of the new regulatory pricing
regime, and the other on preparing a new Energy Act to harmonize Bulgaria’s legislation
with EU Directives and the Energy Efficiency GEF Project.
13.
Education. The reform efforts in the education sector aim at improving expenditure
management in view of the declining population, especially in school age, and at enhancing
quality and access to education. The main priority in the education sector, including
universities, is to reallocate expenditures from surplus capacity in teaching staff and
underused facilities toward modernization and upgrading of curricula, textbooks, teaching
materials, schools, and other quality-enhancing education inputs. The Bank has supported the
government program in education through the Education Modernization Project loan (closed
on March 31, 2004), the PALs, and the analytical work done for the Poverty Assessment, the
PEIR, the Inter-governmental Finance study15, and the Public Finance Policy Review. Under
PAL-2 the government developed a concept for an education reform strategy and action plan,
the implementation of which was supported through PAL-3.
14.
Health care. Key reform priorities in the health sector include addressing the
concurrent problems of surplus capacity issues in health facilities and hospitals, the serious
deterioration in the quality of facilities and health services, and the inadequate modernization
of equipment. At the same time, the government needs to ensure the financial integrity of the
NHIF, which is the central point of the reforms in the sector. The Bank supported the
restructuring of the health sector through the Health Sector Restructuring Project which was
closed at end-2001. The follow-up Health Sector Reform project approved in late 2000 is
under implementation and focuses on the administrative and information systems of the
NHIF, and supports the ambulatory care sector and the hospital sector. The reform agenda
was also supported through the PALs, with PAL-3 focusing on the implementation of the
action plan for the hospital restructuring.
15.
Social protection programs. Social protection programs—pensions, labor market
programs, social assistance, and short-term and family benefits—have a wide coverage
15

Issues in Intergovernmental Relations, the World Bank, January 27, 2004, Report No.
25821-BUL.

65
among the population. On pensions, one reform priority is to improve compliance with, and
coverage of, the public pillar. Ensuring successful implementation of the pension reform was
supported through the PALs. On labor market programs, there is a need to monitor these
closely to improve their effectiveness and long-term impact in stimulating labor demand.
Subject to progress in key reforms, consideration should be given to reduce the tax burden
related to labor market policies in order to curtail labor costs.16 Some social assistance and
benefit programs have become more pro-poor since the mid-1990s and are playing a major
role in alleviating poverty. However, given the plethora of these programs, and the
complexity of program design in many cases, a constant challenge of the social protection
system as a whole is to consolidate the system driven by improving targeting of vulnerable
groups, and engage in systematic monitoring of the programs, their costs and effectiveness to
ensure fiscal sustainability.
16.
The Bank has been the main partner of the government in its efforts to address
poverty reduction and meet its social development objectives. The main findings of the
Poverty Assessment contributes significantly to the enhanced policy dialogue with the
government on its policy options to improve living standards in the country, and increase the
effectiveness and adequacy of its social protection programs. The Bank is assisting these
important reforms in the social protection system through providing grants amounting to
US$2.2 million. The latter focus on poverty monitoring and evaluation, integration of ethnic
minorities, child development and building social capital in disadvantaged communities. A
Bank-financed Child Welfare Reform project helps address the needs of children in public
care, while a Bank-financed Social Investment and Employment Promotion (SIEP), which
supports community and employment creation and strengthening of ALMPs, was approved
in 2002. The IMF has been also monitoring the sustainability of the pension system and the
advancing of the labor market reforms in terms of their relevance for the Fund’s program
objectives.
B.4.

Areas where the World Bank leads and there is no direct IMF involvement.

17.
Private Sector Development. Bulgaria has completed the divestiture of about 95
percent (based on value of assets) of its non-infrastructure state-owned enterprises (SOEs)
since 1995. To encourage the entry of new firms and the expansion of existing ones, the
business climate will have to continue to improve focusing on reducing barriers to entry,
reducing compliance cost of the regulatory regime, developing a competitive environment,
and establishing an efficient exit mechanism for non-viable enterprises. Under the PAL
program, major changes in the basic legislation were initiated - notably the Commercial
Code, the Civil Procedure Code, and the Labor Code, and the passage of legislation on how
the State will regulate economic activity to ensure stability and predictability of regulatory
regimes.

16

However, such fiscal adjustment requires increasing efficiency in public expenditures, and
lowering public expenditures to GDP before implementing tax reductions.

66
18.
In the context of the PAL program, the Bank supported the government in
sector restructuring of the non-infrastructure enterprise sector. Privatization of SOEs
was a major component of the FESALs. Under the PALs, the Bank led the dialogue on
reforms covering the regulatory regimes, the insolvency process, and competition.
19.
Public sector governance. The government is pursuing a broad program to improve
public sector governance including strengthening the capacity of the public administration,
improving service delivery, reducing corruption, and reforming the judiciary. The support of
this program was the main focus of PAL-2. The policy, legal and institutional framework was
developed and put in place to strengthen merit and depolitization. Performance standards for
service delivery were developed and one-stop shop principles were introduced in five central
administrations and six regional administrations. The system of performance appraisal and
professional development within the state administration were enhanced. Concrete steps were
undertaken to increase accountability and transparency – the conflict of interest and asset
declaration regime was strengthened; a monitoring system to track progress in meeting the
anti-corruption objectives was designed; key ministries and agencies prepared detailed and
practical anticorruption action plans.
C. The World Bank Group Strategy and Lending Operations
20.
The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Bulgaria17, discussed by the Bank’s
Board on June 13, 2006, focused on three main themes: (i) productivity and employment, (ii)
fiscal sustainability and absorption of EU funds, and (iii) social inclusion.
21.
The World Bank’s assistance program in Bulgaria to date comprises 38
operations for a total original commitment of US$2,137 million equivalent. This includes
12 adjustment loans (US$1,225.8 million), 19 investment projects (US$750.7 million), one
debt reduction loan (US$125.0 million), four Bank-managed Global Environmental Fund
(GEF) grants, and two Bank-managed Prototype Carbon Fund (PCF) operations. Of these 38
operations, 27 have been completed, of which eleven have been partially cancelled during
implementation, and 11 operations are currently under implementation (see Table 1 below).
22.
IFC, as of May 2006, has 16 projects in its portfolio with total commitments of
US$261 million for its own account and an additional US$78 million syndicated from
partner banks. IFC’s activities comprise the support of financial sector development,
manufacturing, gas production, retail, tourism and restructuring of post-privatized
companies. In the financial sector, IFC has supported two specialized SME banks, Bulgarian
American Credit Bank and Unionbank, established Bulgaria’s first micro lending bank, and
has invested in a leasing company and in a venture capital fund that also target the SME
sector. IFC has invested in a number of key manufacturing projects, such as Devnya Cement
(modernization of a cement production plant), EPIQ Electronic Assembly (modernization
and expansion of an electronic assembly facility), Kronospan I & II (wood panel and board
production), and Sofia Med (revamping of a copper processing facility). IFC committed
17 Memorandum of the President of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Finance
Corporation to the Executive Directors on a Country Assistance Strategy of the World Bank Group for Bulgaria, May 31, 2006.

67
US$48 million to support a project in retail sector (Schwarz Group) and extended a credit
line to a local bank for on-lending to SMEs. As a good example of South-South investments,
IFC has committed about US$90 million to support post-privatization restructuring of a steel
mill (Stomana) and two glass processing plants (Droujba and Trakya).
23.
Economic and Sector Work. The country diagnostic work recently completed
includes: Country Procurement Assessment Report, Issues in Inter-governmental Relations,
and the National Energy Efficiency Study. Other country diagnostic work being completed
includes an infrastructure and energy study, and a roads study, and a Country Economic
Memorandum focused on policy reforms for growth and successful EU integration. Also, a
Public Finance and Policy Review, which examines the options for programming of EU
Structural Funds in a fiscally responsible manner, has recently been finalized.

APPENDIX III. BULGARIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Bulgaria compiles and submits data to the Fund of sufficient quality and in a timely
manner to adequately permit program monitoring and surveillance. Despite a comprehensive
economic database, problems remain in national accounts and price statistics, particularly in
the coverage of the emerging private sector, as well as in the balance of payments statistics,
where frequent and substantial revisions have hampered economic analysis. In addition, work
remains to be done in fully reconciling high frequency data on economic activity with
quarterly and annual national accounts data. Annual international investment position
statistics are compiled and reported to STA for publication.
2.
In January 2003, an STA mission visited Bulgaria to produce a data module of the
Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC). The report provided a summary
of Bulgaria’s data dissemination practices against the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination
Standard, even though Bulgaria, at that time, was a participant in has worked with the
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS).
3.
The ROSC mission concluded that the Bulgarian national accounts, CPI, PPI,
government finance statistics (GFS), and monetary statistics generally follow internationally
accepted guidelines on definitions, scope, classification, sectorization, and valuation. Certain
improvements to scope (national accounts, CPI, and GFS), classification (monetary) and the
basis of recording (national accounts, GFS, and monetary) could be made. More substantial
improvements should be made to the balance of payments statistics. In regard to accuracy
and reliability, the mission noted that source data and statistical techniques are generally
sound for national accounts, and monetary statistics. Improvements could be made to certain
aspects of the price indices and GFS. In the case of balance of payments, significant
improvements are required.
4.
In late 2003, Bulgaria moved from participation in the GDDS to SDDS subscription,
marking a major step forward in the development of the country's statistical system.
Real sector
5.
The National Statistical Institute (NSI), with technical assistance from the OECD, has
established a system to compile national accounts according to the recommendations of the
European System of Accounts 1995. GDP data by activity and expenditure categories are
compiled and reconciled within an annual supply and use framework. Government output
and final consumption are estimated on a cash rather than an accrual basis. In addition,
Bulgaria publishes national accounts including current and capital accounts for the five main
domestic sectors (general government, financial corporations, nonfinancial corporations,
nonprofit institutions serving households, and households). As for most countries, the
financial account and the balance sheets are missing.
6.
The NSI has compiled estimates of quarterly GDP by the production and expenditure
approaches in current and constant prices since 1994. The preliminary data are disseminated
80 days after the end of the reference quarter with final figures disseminated after
approximately 5 quarters. Problems remain in the coverage of private sector activities as well

69
as on the constant price estimates of capital formation and external trade. However,
significant progress has been made in the development of export and import deflators. The
estimates at constant prices use chain-linked indices, which follow international standards
(SNA 1993).
7. A continuing producer price index (PPI) project covering the period June 2000 to January
2004 was established by a price statistics mission that visited the NSI in June 2000. The
project included three supporting IMF technical assistance missions. The main objectives of
the project were to convert from using average prices (unit values) for product categories to
samples of transaction prices for fully specified products, and to update the index aggregation
weights from 1995 to 2000. Despite some minor slippage in timing due to unforeseen
complexities, the project, which related to the domestic market, has now been completed.
The major achievements include the completion of the progressive conversion to transaction
pricing, rebasing the index to the year 2000, recommencement of publication (accompanied
by notification in the Advance Release Calendar and Catalog of Publications and the release
of up-to-date metadata), and improvement in the timeliness of release to conform to the
SDDS standard. A revision of the producer price index (PPI) for domestic sales was
completed in June 2004. The NSI has expanded the collection of transaction prices
throughout the industrial sector of the domestic economy. Publication of the rebased PPI
began in March 2003, with the weights and reference period updated to 2000 and linked at
December 2002 to form a continuous monthly series for the period January 2000 to
January 2003. The index is to be rebased every 5 years. Timeliness of release is now within
one month. Also, progress is being made on the development of a PPI for export sales.
8.
The consumer price index (CPI) provides a reasonable measure of inflation and price
developments in Bulgaria. The recommendations provided by STA missions have been
broadly implemented. The NSI has completed the exercise to link annual Laspeyres-type
price indices together, producing a time series that begins in 1995. This series also follows
the new classifications and index methods recommended by Eurostat and STA, and has been
published as the official CPI. The coverage of the index was extended, although it still
excludes some important sectors, mainly owner-occupied housing and health and life
insurance. Since 2004 financial services are included. The geographical coverage of the
index is restricted to 27 urban areas which account for an estimated 65 percent of sales. A
new method for imputing missing observations of new products is being applied, but quality
adjustment procedures are only applied in a few particular cases (e.g., the heating
component).
9.
The lack of comprehensive labor statistics has hampered the assessment of
developments in employment and wages, especially in the private sector, though there have
been some recent improvements. Annual data are collected by the NSI, using a census of all
establishments. The NSI also obtains current monthly estimates from a quarterly survey of
establishments using all public enterprises and a sample of private employers that includes,
since 2002, establishments with less than 5 employees. For 2003, it includes 14,000 private
employers out of approximately 113,000 qualifying private enterprises. The main
shortcomings of these data include: (i) the under-reporting of private sector wages; (ii) the
reporting of only average gross earnings, not wages for time worked and wages by
occupation; and (iii) the lack of coverage of the self-employed and employment in small

70
firms. However, the National Social Security Institute (NSSI) administrative data are used to
estimate wages by occupation and age and the number of self-employed and employment in
small firms. The household budget survey could provide an alternative source of data for
private sector wages. Regarding employment, the NSI household labor force survey is an
alternative source of data, but improvements are needed to make it more consistent with the
establishment survey, especially regarding agricultural employment. The survey is conducted
four times a year at regular intervals.

regular intervals.
11.
A Population Census was conducted in early 2001 and is a source for redesigning the
household surveys conducted by the NSI, particularly the household budget survey and the
labor force survey.
Government finance
12.
In recent years, following the recommendations of a combined STA/FAD mission
and within the framework of fiscal reporting requirements for EU accession, the authorities
have made great progress on the implementation of accrual accounting for government,
budgetary and statistical systems. Consolidated data on central government operations are
routinely reported for publication in the GFS Yearbook and in IFS. For the GFS Yearbook
20045, 20034 data for the general government sector and its subsectors were reported on a
cash basis. The Ministry of Finance prepares data on the execution of the consolidated
government budget on a monthly basis. These data do not conform to GFS standards and
while not published in a bulletin format they are posted on the Ministry of Finance’s website.
The authorities have made progress in presenting data on a disaggregated basis, including
expenditure by functional classification. In addition, a full economic classification of
expenditure is now available, and the authorities have provided such data on an annual basis
back to 1998.

71
Money and banking statistics
13.
Statistical methods conform with the key classification and valuation principles of the
IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual, 2000. Consistency in the coverage of the
Bulgarian National Bank’s (BNB) claims on banks (which included claims on liquidated
banks) and the banks’ liabilities to the BNB improved in January 2003 after the BNB wrote
off most of the claims on the liquidated banks. With respect to its near-term statistical
program, the BNB is progressively harmonizing its data collection and compilation methods
in line with the European Central Bank’s framework for monetary statistics. In particular, a
significant number of enhancements in sectoral and instrument detail and classification have
progressively been made in the data for 1995 and onward. These were reflected in the revised
monetary statistics published in the August 2002, November 2003, and October 2004 issues
of IFS. The latter revision in IFS is a consequence of the BNB’s statistical work in early
2004, which allowed to recast monetary data to further harmonize with ECB requirements.
Among the changes in the national presentation was the creation in February 2004 of a new
long-term liabilities category outside the money supply that includes deposits and securities
with a maturity over 2 years, deposits redeemable at notice over three months, and capital
and reserves. For program purposes, deposits of the newly created public investment
company, municipalities and social security funds are considered part of the consolidated
general government. These deposits are excluded from M3 and included in net lending to the
consolidated general government.
Balance of payments
14.
Bulgaria reports monthly balance of payments data on a regular and timely basis, but
data on reinvested earnings by foreign-owned companies are subject to large revisions due to
incomplete responses on surveys used for preliminary estimates. An IMF technical assistance
mission in December 2000 made a number of recommendations to strengthen the balance of
payments and external debt compilation systems, which included the development of a
closed-type of international transactions reporting system, the development of estimates of
“shuttle trade” with countries bordering Bulgaria, strengthening the methodology for travel
transactions, and compiling data on trade credit liabilities. The treatment of the license to
operate a mobile telephone service has been clarified and agreed with the BNB. As a result
the GSM license purchase has been recorded under foreign direct investment (equity capital)
in the first quarter of 2001. As there is no repayment obligation, the transaction did not
change the country’s external debt position. Balance of payments transactions related to the
mobile phone license are no longer recorded for the subsequent periods.
15.
In 2003, tThe data ROSC mission identified the following problems in the balance of
payments statistics: i) residents’ foreign currency accounts with resident banks are
incorrectly included; ii) merchandise trade data are prone to errors and are not timely; and iii)
most data are collected on a cash basis. More recently, large revisions to the data on
reinvested earnings for 2003 have revealed that the sample used to obtain the preliminary
data for this series is inadequate, in part because of the omission of the largest firms.

Dear Mr. de Rato:
1.
The attached Third Supplementary Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
(TSMEFP) describes the performance under the economic program that is supported by the
Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) approved by the International Monetary Fund on August 6,
2004 and the policies that the government and the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) intend to
pursue in the remainder of 2006 as part of the 2004-06 economic and financial program
outlined in the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies attached to the letter of
July 21, 2004 and amended by the supplementary memoranda attached to the letters of April
26, 2005 and March 14, 2006. Our core objectives, supported by the policies described in the
TSMEFP, remain the maintenance of macroeconomic stability and sustained high rates of
economic growth in the run-up to EU membership in 2007.

As described in the TSMEFP, economic developments in the early months of 2006
show a continuation of excess demand trends, with a further deterioration in the current
account projected for 2006. All quantitative performance criteria for March 31, 2006 were
met. However, the three structural performance criteria for April 30 and June 30, 2006 were
missed, and we request waivers for their nonobservance.
•

Owing to extended consultations with the business community, it was not possible to
complete the parliamentary passage of the new VAT law by April 30, 2006. It has
been passed in second reading by the budget commission and its approval by
parliament is a prior action for the completion of the third review (TSMEFP,
Annex I).

•

Delays in parliamentary passage of the law transforming business registration from a
judicial to an administrative procedure, and the need to identify and prepare software,
meant that it was not feasible for the new business register to start operations by
June 30, 2006. We now expect the register to start operations on the date specified in
the legislation, of October 1, 2006 (performance criterion).

•

The Varna thermal power plant was sold by June 30, 2006. However, it has not yet
been possible to complete the sale of the Rousse district heating company, due to

74
delays in the tender process. We now intend to select winning bids for the Rousse
plants by October 31, 2006 (performance criterion).
3.
In addition, six of the eight structural benchmarks applying through end-June, 2006
were missed. Of these, one was missed by a small margin, one implemented with delay, and
one is on track to be completed shortly. Remedial actions and rephasing of conditionality
have been proposed for the remaining three.
4.
We request an extension of the arrangement through to end-March 2007 and a
rephasing of our remaining access of SDR 11 million. We understand that our compliance
with the program will be monitored through a fourth review, quantitative and structural
performance criteria and structural benchmarks through December 31, 2006, as well as a
continuous performance criterion and benchmark through the end of the arrangement.
Reaching an understanding on the 2007 budget will be a key element for completion of the
fourth review.
5.
The TSMEFP proposes quantitative performance criteria for September 30 and
December 31, 2006, as described in its Annexes II – IV. In addition, program implementation
is proposed to be monitored by the three structural performance criteria, the three continuous
performance criteria and the nine structural benchmarks listed in Annex I of the TSMEFP.
6.
We believe that the policies set forth in the TSMEFP are adequate to attain the
objectives of our program, but we will take any further measures that may become
appropriate for this purpose. Bulgaria will consult with the Fund on the adoption of these
measures, and in advance of any revisions to the policies contained in the TSMEFP, in
accordance with the Fund’s policies on such consultations. We will provide the Fund with
such information as it requests on policy implementation and achievement of program
objectives.
7.
We would like to reaffirm our intention not to make the purchases under the SBA that
will become available upon observance of its performance criteria and completion of its
reviews and to make all outstanding repurchases to the Fund on the expectations schedule.
Sincerely yours,

Attachment: Third Supplementary Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies

75
Third Supplementary Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
I. Recent Economic Developments
1.
Recent economic developments point to upward revisions to forecasts of growth,
inflation and the current account deficit. Economic growth is now projected at 5.6 percent
for the year, a little higher than the 5.5 percent projected under the program, because of
stronger domestic demand. Demand continues to be fueled by strong corporate and
household borrowing. At 8.1 percent in April, inflation was somewhat higher than projected,
mainly because of higher fuel prices and a larger-than-anticipated impact of the increase in
tobacco and alcohol excise duties at the start of the year. Inflation is now expected to
moderate to 6.2 percent by the end of the year, compared to 5.7 percent under the program.
The current account deficit was considerably larger than projected in the first three months of
2006. This was partly due to temporary factors that should unwind later in the year.
Nevertheless the stronger than expected demand suggests that the current account will now
show a slight deterioration in 2006 compared to 2005, at about 12.4 percent of GDP,
compared to 10.2 percent of GDP previously projected. We do not see competitiveness as
being a significant factor in this deterioration. Foreign direct investment is on track to come
in close to the program level in 2006, at 9.2 percent of GDP. Gross external debt reached
69.5 percent of GDP at end-March, and is expected to end the year at nearly 70 percent of
GDP, close to the programmed level.
II. Economic Policies and Objectives for the Remainder of 2006
2.
Our economic program aims at maintaining a stable policy framework within
which to prepare for EU accession on January 1, 2007 and subsequent entry into the
eurozone. Maintenance of the currency board at an unchanged exchange rate until euro
adoption in 2009-10 remains the cornerstone of our economic policy. Strong private sector
demand in anticipation of EU accession and convergence is likely to lead to continued high
current account deficits and external debt levels through the medium term. The priorities of
reducing these external vulnerabilities and lowering inflation in order to meet the conditions
for euro adoption will require a continued commitment to very prudent economic policies in
coming years. Our program for the remainder of 2006 therefore remains focused on fiscal
restraint, incomes policies, tight financial sector supervision, and structural reforms to
strengthen competitiveness. The limited capacity and availability of fiscal and monetary
policy to manage the very rapid private sector demand growth highlights the importance of
the structural agenda in particular, in order for Bulgaria to grow strongly and function
effectively under the currency board arrangement and, eventually, within EMU.

76
A. Fiscal Policy
3.
Given the further deterioration of the external current account now projected
for 2006, we do not see any scope to relax our ambitious fiscal surplus target for this
year. As described in the Second Supplementary Memorandum of Economic and Financial
Policies (SSMEFP) attached to our letter of March 14, 2006, and set out in Annex II of this
Memorandum, we will achieve a significant increase in the budget surplus from 2.3 percent
of GDP in 2005 to at least 3 percent of GDP in 2006 (performance criterion). Should
revenues exceed the quarterly targets set out in Annex II, we will save 50 percent of any such
cumulative quarterly overperformance, and the performance criterion on the fiscal surplus
will accordingly be raised above 3 percent of GDP. In pursuing these objectives we will seek
to avoid the accumulation of new central government arrears (performance criterion) and
urge municipalities to eliminate their arrears (which amounted to 0.1 percent of GDP at endMarch, 2006). We do not envisage making any adjustments to tax rates applying in the
remainder of 2006, and we remain committed to permanently withholding 7 percent of
discretionary expenditure if necessary to meet our fiscal targets, as set out in the SSMEFP
and regardless of the level of the current account deficit.
4.
Fiscal policy implementation in the first three months of 2006 has been
consistent with our commitments under the program. The fiscal surplus in the first
quarter is estimated at BGN 398 million, comfortably exceeding the program target of
BGN 256 million. Revenues came in slightly below target, partly because of a number of
temporary factors which we expect to be made good in the remainder of the year. The
revenue shortfall in the first quarter was more than made up by a slow pace of expenditures,
especially on wages and salaries, social assistance, and capital spending. For the year as a
whole we expect a small overperformance of revenues, which, if realized, would imply an
increase in the fiscal surplus target from 3 to 3.2 percent of GDP.
5.
Given the stubbornly high current account deficit, our preliminary plans
envisage passage of a budget for 2007 targeting a fiscal surplus of about 2 percent of
GDP. At present considerable uncertainties remain regarding the fiscal impact of EU-related
flows and revenue losses arising from accession, as well as about prospective underlying
revenue performance. We will therefore refrain from committing to tax cuts for next year
until the full parameters of the 2007 budget are clarified in the fall of 2006. Reaching an
understanding on the 2007 budget will be a key element for completion of the fourth review
under the SBA.
6.
We have strengthened our program for public sector reforms, including
reductions in staff numbers. Fiscal costs associated with EU accession reinforce the need
to restructure existing budgetary spending programs, in order to achieve fiscal savings and
more efficient delivery of public services.

77
•

We have cut 3,909 existing positions in the state administration, with a further 1,381
positions identified for closure by the end of 2006.

•

We have submitted an education reform strategy to parliament which sets out our
broad objectives in terms of improving the quality of teaching, and rationalizing
school and staff numbers against the backdrop of sharply falling pupil numbers. In
pursuit of these objectives we have identified 5,500 staff cuts that will be
implemented by September 30, 2006 (structural benchmark). The 2006 budget
incorporates a contingency of BGN 9m to help meet transitional costs associated with
school closures and redundancies. We have further decided to move to a
decentralized system of school financing based on unified per student standards for
financing municipalities, which will provide appropriate incentives to municipalities
to implement school consolidation and staff cuts, compared to the present input-based
system of school financing. We will develop the new unified standards with the
assistance of the World Bank, with Council of Ministers approval expected by
October 31, 2006 (structural benchmark). We are developing a strategy for reform of
tertiary education, including review of financing mechanisms, which we will submit
to parliament by December 31, 2006.

•

The move to financing of nearly all hospital care through the National Health
Insurance Fund (NHIF) from January 1, 2006 has improved incentives for better
financial management in the hospital sector, and there has been no net accumulation
of hospital arrears in the first quarter of the year. We are committed not to undermine
these incentives by bailing out hospitals that run arrears. However, reimbursements
by the NHIF have been running ahead of plan, which could lead to a budget shortfall
for the year of around BGN 50 million, requiring offsetting savings elsewhere in the
budget sector. In order to improve financial discipline from 2007 on we have drafted
amendments to the health insurance law that will: (i) include in the law control
procedures and sanctions for misreporting in reimbursement claims by hospitals and
other health care providers to the NHIF, at a sufficiently high level to discourage such
abuses; (ii) regulate that price and volume ceilings for the clinical paths are part of the
annual budget law of the NHIF; and (iii) require hospitals to provide the NHIF with
full financial reporting, subject to audit, and give the NHIF powers to withhold
finance in case of inadequate reporting or unsatisfactory financial results. We will
submit these amendments to parliament by July 31, 2006, with a view to passage by
August 31, 2006 (structural benchmark). Nevertheless it remains the case that an
improved financial situation in the health sector and more effective delivery of health
services will depend on an extensive restructuring and consolidation of the hospital
sector. To this end we will engage consultants by September 30, 2006, with the
assistance of the World Bank, to develop a National Hospital Masterplan.

78
7.
Any changes to pension levels in the remainder of 2006 will be limited to the
lower pension brackets, and fit within the overall NSSI budget plan. Our plans for 2007
are based on pension indexation according to a 50 percent/50 percent ratio between CPI and
insured income growth from June 1, 2007, increasing the employees’ share of social security
contributions from 35 percent to 40 percent, and raising the contribution to the second pillar
of the pension system from 4 to 5 percent.
8.
We are pursuing our program of revenue administration reform. The start-up of
the National Revenue Agency (NRA) in January 2006 did not lead to any discernible initial
loss in revenues, and we are confident that over time the NRA will contribute to revenue
gains. Unfortunately there has been further delay in the delivery of the new software to
integrate tax and social security collections. We now expect the new integrated collection
software system to be fully operational by December 31, 2006 (structural benchmark). The
new law on duty free trade, specifying limits on individual purchases of goods and fuels and
strengthened controls, is expected to be passed by the parliament by August 31, 2006. The
new VAT law is intended to be passed by the parliament by July 25, 2006 (prior action). We
intend the PIT and CIT laws to be passed by July 31, 2006 (structural benchmark).
9.

We are planning a number of other reforms in the fiscal area:
•

Fiscal transparency. We intend to present parliament with realistic fiscal projections
in the 2007 budget, and plan to achieve our fiscal target without resort to within-year
caps on discretionary expenditures. Along with the budget submission we plan to
provide more information, including full medium-term fiscal forecasts, an expanded
analysis of fiscal risks, details of concessions, central government contingent
liabilities, and government financial asset holdings. We recognize the importance of
improved public procurement procedures, especially in view of increased project
funding from the EU. A new public procurement law has been adopted. It remains our
intention to avoid the creation of new extrabudgetary funds or state-owned enterprises
(continuous structural benchmark). However, the CoM has approved the
transformation of the existing Road Agency into an extrabudgetary fund structure
from January 2007, in order to meet EU requirements. The Road Agency will
continue to be fully consolidated in general government accounts, and subject to the
same accounting and auditing standards as the rest of the budget sector. The legal
process for closure of the Public Investment Projects company (PIP) will be initiated
by December 31, 2006 (structural benchmark).

•

Expenditure management. While our budget management system meets EU
requirements, we nevertheless intend to further strengthen public expenditure
management. With the reporting for the second half of 2006 we will have
implemented the Financial Management Information System as the sole expenditure

79
accounting system in the Ministry of Finance. We intend to identify improved
expenditure control mechanisms for other ministries by the end of 2006.
•

Program budgeting. We are continuing to introduce program and performanceoriented budgeting. We intend to expand pilot program budgeting by six further
ministries in the 2007 budget, bringing the total to 16 ministries and one agency, and
five ministries will also report their 2006 budgets on a program basis.
B. Incomes and Labor Market Policies

10.
The persistent excess demand situation underscores the importance of public
sector wage restraint and labor market reforms to help maintain competitiveness and
flexibility of the economy. Budget sector wages will be increased by 6 percent on average in
July 2006. Larger wage increases needed to attract and retain staff working on EU project
administration will be met within the overall budgeted wage bill. In 2007, we intend public
sector wages to rise only modestly in real terms. In the first quarter of 2006 we observed the
quarterly limit on the increase of the aggregate wage bill of the 58 largest public enterprises
that are monopolies, received government subsidies, made losses, or had arrears in the third
quarter of 2005. Observance of these limits will continue to be monitored on a cumulative
quarterly basis (performance criterion). We continue to plan for an increase in the minimum
wage in 2007 to BGN 170, from BGN 160 in 2006.
11.
Labor market reforms are aimed at improving flexibility and labor force
participation. Our key policy initiatives in this area are:
•

The parliament has passed legal amendments to increase working time flexibility by
extending the maximum working week from 40 to 48 hours and by lengthening
calculation periods for overtime work from four to six months.

•

We have been unable to agree with our social partners on the removal of the
obligatory character of the portability of seniority bonuses in case of unemployment,
change of employer or job position. We are continuing the discussions with our social
partners on this issue, and hope to reach agreement by the end of 2006 (structural
benchmark). Any reduction in seniority pay for existing workers resulting from our
discussions would be expected to be added back in to the basic wage, so that no
existing employee would suffer a pay cut from the change.
C. Financial Sector and Public Asset and Liability Management

12.
The bank credit ceilings adopted by the BNB in 2005 will be phased out
gradually. Total credit growth in the first quarter of 2006 was in line with the ceilings set by
the BNB, and the individual banks that exceeded the limits were subjected to significant

80
penalty deposits at the BNB. However, as expected, banks are increasingly able to
circumvent the limits. Methods have included passing loans to foreign banks’ head offices,
and packaging loans in off-balance sheet special purpose vehicles, in order to remove loans
from bank balance sheets to free up space for new lending within the ceilings. At the same
time, credit from the nonbank financial sector continues to grow strongly. Thus the
effectiveness of the bank credit ceilings in reducing financial flows to the private sector is
much diminished at this stage. The lifting of the credit ceilings will be phased so as to
minimize disruption to the financial sector. Our plans in this regard will be discussed with
IMF staff.
13.
The existing tight bank prudential and supervisory framework will be
maintained. To allow the implementation of Basel II as of January 2007, we have submitted
to parliament a new law on Credit Institutions for approval by September 30, 2006 (structural
benchmark), and the BNB will issue the relevant regulations by the end of 2006 at the latest.
The BNB will apply the EU Capital Requirement Directive in a conservative way.
14.
Transparency inlending has been improved. The new law on consumer credit
requires disclosure in advertising of effective annual percentage rates on consumer and
household mortgage loans between BGN 400 and BGN 40,000.
15.
Supervision of the rapidly growing non-bank financial sector is being
modernized. The pension law was amended to remove the minimum share that voluntary
pension funds were required to hold in government securities, with only a modest impact on
these funds’ asset allocation. The law on supplementary supervision of financial
conglomerates has been submitted to parliament and is expected to be approved by
September 5, 2006 (structural benchmark). The Financial Supervision Commission (FSC)
has received technical assistance from the IMF to support the implementation of the
insurance law adopted in December 2005.
16.
We will continue to strengthen prudential and market conduct regulation, and
supervision, of the insurance sector. By end July, the FSC will develop (a) an internal
procedure for enforcement and (b) a strategy to tighten supervision of underwriting practices
of non-life insurance companies. During the second half of 2006, the FSC will re-license
compulsory motor third party liability (MTPL) insurance companies. The FSC will also
conduct an in-depth review of the adequacy of premiums and of the other guarantees for the
solvency of the insurance companies offering MTPL insurance. By the end of 2006, we will
submit to the Council of Ministers a draft amendment to the Insurance Code that will a)
tighten corporate governance practices of insurance companies by requiring separation of
powers between the board and the management and by requiring independent directors, and
b) require audit of the statutory annual returns of insurance companies. By year end, the FSC
will issue a regulation to exclude investments in related and affiliated companies from
calculations of own funds for meeting statutory solvency requirements.

81

17.
We will improve the follow-up to money laundering-related disclosures of the
Financial Intelligence Agency. Referrals to the police made by the Agency are rising
rapidly but have not led to any convictions by the courts. To improve the follow-up to these
disclosures a special unit within the police has been established. This unit is organized in a
similar manner to the unit that was created in the prosecutor’s office in March 2006.
18.
Public asset and liability management will continue to aim at reducing gross
debt while maintaining adequate reserve cover. The ceilings on the contracting and
guaranteeing of external public debt in 2006 remain as in the original program (performance
criteria). We have no immediate plans for additional external debt prepayments, but such
prepayments could be considered, subject to the maintenance of freely available international
reserves. In order to better monitor municipal borrowing we are developing a register for
such loans, to be made operational by December 31, 2006 (structural performance criterion).
D. Other Structural Reforms
19.
We are proceeding with the reform of business registration. The law transforming
business registration from a judicial to an administrative procedure under the Registration
Agency was passed on March 24 and enacted on April 25, 2006. We intend to make the new
registry operational by October 1 (structural performance criterion).
20.
We are committed to further privatization of state assets. The privatization of
Varna electricity generation company has recently been completed. We will issue tenders for
the eastern and western plants of the Rousse district heating company by August 15, 2006,
with a view to selecting the winning bids for both by October 31, 2006 (structural
performance criterion). We will proceed expeditiously to privatize the Bobov Dol power
plant once the court case concerning its sale is resolved. All but one of the remaining district
heating companies are expected to be privatized by December 31, 2006. We intend to
privatize units of Bulgartabac Holding during the second half of 2006. We have selected the
winning bid for the river shipping company in Rousse. The transaction has been approved by
the Privatization Agency and the Council of Ministers. The privatization strategy for the
maritime shipping company will be submitted to parliament by July 31, 2006, with approval
expected by August 31. The privatization strategy for the airline company has been
approved, and the tender has been issued. The concession agreement for the Varna and
Bourgas airports has been awarded, and provided there are no further court appeals we hope
that construction work will commence later in 2006. Concessions for four major ports are
being prepared.
21.
Based on an assessment by business organizations, we plan to establish a body to
evaluate the regulatory environment. This will monitor the implementation of existing
regimes, and scrutinize new regulatory proposals. We have prepared draft amendments to the

82
law on investment promotion intended to speed up administrative processes, and plan to
submit them to parliament by August 31, 2006, following further consultation within
government.
22.
We are continuing to implement our anti-corruption program. We have prepared
the anti-corruption strategy for 2006-08 and implementation program for 2006. In the first
three months of 2006, we set our priority towards prevention and counteraction of high-level
corruption, corruption in the education and healthcare systems, as well as in the
administration of the tax revenues. We plan to develop an amendment to the Law on the
Political Parties to introduce transparency in party financing (including publicity of the
source of financing) by end 2006. The National Audit Office is due to publish an audit report
on the political parties by September 30, 2006. We have prepared a program for transparency
in the activity of the state administration and high-level officials.

1/ Arrears ceiling is on the stock of central government arrears.
2/ Indicative target on general government revenue (including grants).
Quarterly limits in this Annex are cumulative with the exception of central government
arrears.
The general government accounts are defined to comprise the consolidated budget (including
the republican budget, the budgets of ministries and local governments, and the social
security funds NSSI and NHIF) as well as all extrabudgetary funds and accounts at the
central and local government levels, the public investment projects (PIP) enterprise, and the
environment enterprise. The central government is defined as the general government minus
the sum of the local government budgets and the extrabudgetary funds and accounts at the
local government level.
For program monitoring purposes, the arrears of the central (general) government are all
overdue obligations on the payment for central (general) government expenditure excluding
items in dispute. The stock of central government arrears as of December 31, 2005 amounted
to BGN 4.8 million.
For program monitoring purposes, the fiscal balance (surplus/deficit) will be defined as the
difference between general government revenue (taxes, nontaxes, and grants) and general
government expenditure, including net capital transfers (net acquisition of shares and net
lending) and adjusted for the net change of the stock of general government arrears. In
contrast with the national practice, in the program definition the government’s social security
contributions for its own workers (except those to the second pension pillar) are excluded
from both revenue and expenditure. In 2006, the quarterly fiscal balance targets will be raised
by 50 percent of the excess of actual over targeted cumulative general government revenue
(including grants). If general government revenue (including grants) exceeds the program’s

86
target of BGN 18,454 million, 50 percent of any such cumulative quarterly revenue
overperformance will be saved and the fiscal surplus floor raised accordingly.
Reporting on the fiscal balance will be cross checked from the financing side as the sum of
net credit from the domestic banking system to the general government, general government
deposits and accounts abroad, net domestic nonbank credit to the general government,
privatization receipts of the central and municipal government budgets, receipts from
external loans for project implementation and direct budgetary support minus amortization
due, net disbursement/repayment of loans whose final payee is an entity outside the general
government consolidation (onlending operations), and the net increase/decrease of general
government arrears, including those on the amortization of principal. For calculating the
performance against this ceiling, all privatization receipts are treated as financing items.
External flows will be converted into leva at the BNB daily exchange rate. Valuation changes
in deposits and accounts that are denominated in foreign currencies will be recorded daily
and reported by the BNB and the Ministry of Finance at the end of each quarter, and such
changes will be netted out.
All data in this Annex will be reported quarterly by the Ministry of Finance (and by the BNB
for some of the financing items in the preceding paragraph) within 60 days of the end of each
calendar quarter.

The quarterly ceiling on the aggregate wage bill of the 58 state-owned enterprises closely
monitored for their large losses or arrears, for receiving subsidies, or for being monopolies, is
5 percent above the level of the aggregate wage bill in the third quarter of 2005 and is
accumulated by the same amount for each subsequent quarter. The wage bill is defined to
include wages and payroll taxes paid by the employer but does not include additional
compensation under Article 12 of the 2006 Incomes Ordinance
Those enterprises that have been privatized or ceased operations will be excluded from the
list for the respective test dates. Those enterprises that register profits in each of the first two
quarters of 2006 will also exit the list in the second half of 2006 unless they are monopolies,
have arrears, or receive state subsidies. If an enterprise is excluded from the list, the wage bill
ceiling for each subsequent quarter will be adjusted down by the amount of that enterprise’s

Statement by the IMF Staff Representatives
August 2, 2006

1.
This statement provides information on data releases that have become available
since the issuance of the staff report on July 19, and on the outstanding prior action. The new
information does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
On balance, the new data suggest that economic developments are in broad
conformity with the staff report. Year-on-year GDP growth in the first quarter of 2006
reached 5.6 percent per annum, up marginally from 5.5 percent in 2005. News on inflation in
June was mixed—headline inflation (year-on-year) fell to 8.2 percent from 8.5 percent in
May due largely to lower food prices, but core inflation (excluding food, alcohol, tobacco
and energy) turned up slightly to 4.1 percent.
3.
The 12-month current account deficit reached 14.7 percent of GDP at end-May,
essentially unchanged from its end-April level. The broad-based growth of merchandise
exports was especially strong during May, exceeding import growth by a large margin for the
second consecutive month. FDI inflows remained strong, covering about two-thirds of the
current account deficit during January-May. At the same time, large positive errors and
omissions, amounting to some 3.2 percent of annual GDP during the period, also help to
moderate concerns about the size of the current account deficit insofar as they do not reflect
additional debt flows.
4.
Fiscal developments continue to be favorable. The general government surplus
reached 2.6 percent of GDP in the year to May (on a cash basis). Assuming that the ceiling
on arrears was observed, the data suggest that the second quarter fiscal target under the
program was probably comfortably met.
5.
The prior action has been implemented. On 20 July 2006, Parliament adopted the
VAT law on its second reading.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with
Bulgaria
On August 2, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Bulgaria and completed the Third Review under the Stand-By
Arrangement.1
Background
Bulgaria’s successful transition from crisis a decade ago to steady growth has helped the
country reach the doorstep of the European Union accession. A policy strategy anchored by the
currency board arrangement and supported by prudent fiscal policy, strict incomes policy for
state-owned enterprises, tight supervision of the banking sector, and structural reforms has
resulted in average real GDP growth of 5½ percent since the last Article IV consultation in 2004.
The unemployment rate has continued to drop and wage pressures remain contained. Inflation
has been trending up since early 2005, but should begin to taper off during the second half of
2006. In response to rapidly rising current account deficits, fiscal policy have been prudent
during the past few years, and the growth of bank lending to the nongovernment sector was
brought down from almost 50 percent during 2003-04 to 32 percent in 2005.
Despite generally favorable macroeconomic developments, Bulgaria’s vulnerability has
increased with the sharp widening of the current account deficit. The current account deficit
deteriorated from under 6 percent of GDP in 2003 and 2004 to around 12 percent of GDP in
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.

2005, rising further to 14.6 percent by April 2006. Although one-off factors and rising oil prices
have contributed, much of the increase of the deficit can be traced to the buoyancy of domestic
demand, notably investment but also consumption. Competitiveness indicators remain
favorable. Foreign direct investment financed more than two thirds of the current account deficit
and contributed to a rising investment to GDP ratio. Gross reserves at 140 percent of short-term
debt, low public debt, and a well-capitalized banking sector suggest low risk exposure. Still, with
the growth of private debt out-pacing the decline in public debt, Bulgaria’s external debt has
increased substantially since 2003, increasing the country’s vulnerability to shocks. Close
monitoring is warranted as liquidity and solvency risk could change quickly.
The structural reform momentum has weakened, adversely affecting Bulgaria’s growth potential.
An impressive privatization program made substantial progress but recent transactions have
been mired in the courts. Reform of the education sector, critical to Bulgaria’s future
competitiveness, has been stalled. Health sector reforms have been equally inert, yet are
crucial to releasing scarce public resources for higher priority spending. The business climate
and governance indicators have ceased to improve, and greater labor market flexibility is
needed notably in view of the projected decline of Bulgaria’s population of labor force age.
For 2006, given the large and growing current account deficit, the authorities target of at least
3 percent of GDP in 2006 and around 2 percent in 2007 after taking account of EU accession
effects. Fiscal policy is the main short-term macroeconomic policy instrument as credit controls
have largely lost their effectiveness. In order to enhance Bulgaria’s medium term supply
potential, the authorities are implementing measures to improve governance and the business
climate.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Bulgarian authorities for implementing sound economic
policies in recent years that have resulted in robust growth and falling unemployment.
These achievements have enhanced confidence in the economy and prepared the ground for
accession to the European Union. Directors noted, however, that external imbalances have
increased, credit growth is rapid, and inflation has risen, giving rise to sizeable risks.
They stressed that policies need to aim to contain the underlying vulnerabilities and increase
the resilience of the economy.
Directors noted that buoyant domestic demand has contributed to a sharp widening of the
external current account deficit and higher inflation. Although competitiveness appears to be
satisfactory, the high and rising ratio of gross external debt to GDP is of concern, despite the
sharp reduction in public external debt. Directors therefore called for maintaining cautious
macroeconomic policies to moderate the growth of domestic demand and reduce debt, for
prudent incomes policies to help safeguard competitiveness, and for a revitalized structural
reform effort to boost output and export potential. Directors supported the authorities’ strategy of
retaining the currency board at the present parity through to euro adoption.
Directors saw fiscal policy as the key macroeconomic policy tool, and commended the
authorities for the progressive fiscal tightening in recent years. In view of the further
deterioration of the current account balance, Directors welcomed the government’s commitment
to a fiscal surplus of 3 percent of GDP in 2006. They noted that, with revenue performance

3
expected to exceed earlier projections, and with the authorities’ commitment to save half of this
overperformance, achieving a larger surplus is appropriate and feasible.
As the current account deficit is projected to decline only slowly, Directors welcomed the
authorities’ commitment to caution in relaxing the fiscal stance over the medium term. Directors
endorsed the fiscal surplus target of 2 percent of GDP for 2007, seeing the slight reduction in
the surplus from that of 2006 as balancing appropriately the need to absorb EU accessionrelated financial flows with the need to contain domestic demand. Directors stressed that for
EU-financed projects to boost Bulgaria’s productive potential, stronger administrative capacity is
needed to ensure both high quality projects and effective use of the inflows. Directors called for
improvements in public procurement and expenditure management and, more broadly, for
greater fiscal transparency, notably by providing parliament with realistic revenue and
expenditure projections at the time of budget submission.
Directors concurred with the authorities’ plans to maintain low tax rates and to limit exemptions
in the context of a continued shift away from direct taxation. In light of macroeconomic
developments, however, they welcomed the authorities’ intention to postpone further tax cuts
until there is clear evidence of their affordability. They also agreed that future rate cuts should
give priority to reducing the payroll tax, which remains relatively high even after the welcome
reduction in 2006.
Directors supported the authorities’ intention to phase out the bank credit growth limits, noting
that their effectiveness has faded over time due to increasing circumvention and the expanding
availability of nonbank credit. While financial soundness indicators are satisfactory and stress
tests indicate that the banking system is resilient to a significant adverse shock, supervisors
need to scrutinize nonperforming loans closely and ensure the adequacy of banks’ risk
management frameworks. Directors underlined the importance of supervising closely the
growing non-bank financial sector.
Directors underscored the urgency of enhancing the flexibility of the economy to enable it to
handle better external shocks. They encouraged the authorities to revitalize the structural
reform effort to reduce vulnerabilities, help sustain competitiveness, and boost growth potential,
thereby accelerating the convergence of Bulgarian living standards to those of Western Europe.
Efforts to increase labor market flexibility and minimize disincentives to labor market
participation will be critical, especially in light of demographic prospects. Directors stressed the
need to improve the business climate to sustain foreign direct investment, including by
strengthening the judicial system, reducing red tape, and combating corruption forcefully.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to privatize several remaining state assets—
including in the energy sector—and to reform the health and education sectors.

IMF Executive Board Completes Third Review Under Stand-By Arrangement
for Bulgaria
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the third review
of Bulgaria's economic performance under the 25-month Stand-By Arrangement with Bulgaria.
The authorities continue to treat the arrangement as precautionary.
In completing the review, the Board approved the authorities' request for a waiver for the nonobservance of the end-April 2006 structural performance criteria on the approval by Parliament
of the new law on the value added tax, the end-June 2006 structural performance criterion on the
start-up operations of the new business register, and the end-June structural performance
criterion on the selection of the winning bidders for the Rousse and Varna electricity generation
companies. The Board approved the authorities' request to rephrase and extend the Arrangement
until March 31, 2007.
The 25-month Stand-By Arrangement was approved on August 6, 2004 (see Press Release
No.04/175 ) for an amount equivalent to SDR 100 million (about US$148.4 million).
Following the Executive Board discussion, on August 2, 2006, Ms. Anne O. Krueger, First
Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, said:
“The Bulgarian economy has continued to benefit from confidence inspired by sustained sound
macroeconomic policies and optimism surrounding impending EU accession. Spurred by
consumption and strong investment, steady growth continues to be accompanied by falling
unemployment. However, strong private domestic demand, buoyed by rapid credit growth, has
contributed to rising inflation and a substantial deterioration of the current account deficit.
Despite the halving of public external debt in recent years to a comparatively low level,
Bulgaria’s overall external debt is high and climbing, raising the country’s vulnerability to
external shocks. The authorities’ economic and structural reform program under the stand-by
arrangement is therefore appropriately aimed at containing the underlying risks.
“Fiscal policy remains the key macroeconomic policy lever under the currency board
arrangement. In this regard, the budget surplus in 2006, now expected to exceed 3 percent of
GDP, is helping to compensate partly for excess private domestic demand. With the current
account deficit expected to remain high over the near term, however, there is little room for a

-2-

relaxation of fiscal policy. Taking into account the negative budgetary impact of financial flows
upon EU accession and the ensuing additional demand pressures, the budget in 2007 should aim
to achieve a surplus of 2 percent of GDP. In reaching this minimum target, however, the
authorities will need to compensate accession-related spending increases by offsetting cuts in
existing programs and projects. Postponing further tax cuts until they are more affordable is also
important.
“Credit growth has slowed, although the effectiveness of the credit limits introduced by the
central bank has been declining. The program anticipates their gradual phase-out during the
remainder of 2006. Although the banking system remains profitable and well capitalized, risks
need to be monitored with vigilance following several years of rapid credit growth. Supervisors
need to follow monetary and credit developments and ensure the adequacy of banks’ risk
management frameworks.
“A revitalization of the structural reform effort is needed, and in this vein, the program focuses
rightly on speeding up and deepening structural reforms to safeguard competitiveness and boost
Bulgaria’s growth potential. Particular emphasis is being placed on increasing labor market
flexibility to raise labor force participation and employment, improving the business climate to
sustain investment, including through reforms of the judiciary and reductions of red tape, and a
forceful anti-corruption effort. Privatization of additional state assets will be accelerated.
“Bulgaria’s transition from crisis a decade ago to steady growth has helped the country reach the
doorstep of EU accession. To reap the full economic benefits of membership, further structural
reforms will be particularly crucial, because they hold the promise of making the economy more
flexible and dynamic, yielding stronger growth and better export performance. They are also
needed for Bulgaria to realize its ambitions for faster convergence of living standards toward EU
levels, and to have the agility to function successfully upon eventual membership of the
monetary union,” Ms. Krueger said.
