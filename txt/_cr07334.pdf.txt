August 17, 2007

•

The 2007 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Sana’a during
May 31–June 13, 2007, with the prime minister; the deputy prime minister and
minister of planning and international cooperation; the ministers of finance, oil
and minerals, industry and trade, civil service, and social affairs and labor; the
governor of the central bank, and other government officials. The mission also
met with various private sector representatives and donors.

•

The staff team comprised Messrs. van Rooden (head) and Davoodi,
Mses. Guin-Siu, Jardaneh, and Naqi (all MCD), and Mr. Kato (PDR).
Mr. Bennett (MCD) joined the discussions for a few days.

•

Yemen has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and
maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions.

•

The Yemeni authorities maintain that the exchange rate system is an
independent float. Staff are of the view that de facto it is a crawling peg, in
which the rate of crawl has recently slowed to resemble a conventional peg.
Accordingly, under the IMF’s classification, Yemen is currently considered a
de facto conventional peg.

•

The quality and timeliness of data are weak, but still adequate for surveillance
purposes. Yemen participates in the General Data Dissemination Standard.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Focus of the report
The discussions for the 2007 Article IV consultation focused on the need to (i) bring down
inflation; (ii) achieve fiscal sustainability in the context of declining oil reserves; and
(iii) promote nonhydrocarbon growth to create employment opportunities and reduce poverty.
Background
Economic performance in Yemen in 2006 was generally favorable, with strong non-oil growth
more than offsetting a decline in oil production, but inflation doubled to over 20 percent. The
higher inflation partly reflected rising world food prices, but also buoyant domestic demand,
driven by high government spending from record oil revenues—including a large wage
increase—and rapid money growth. Inflation slowed in early 2007 due to seasonal factors. As
oil could run out in some 10 years time and oil revenues account for three-fourths of
government revenues, fiscal (and external) sustainability would be at risk without a large fiscal
adjustment. Fuel subsidies take up a large part of government spending and exceed non-oil tax
revenues. Without corrective actions, or major new oil or gas finds, government finances would
deteriorate rapidly in the coming years, risking domestic and external instability.
Authorities’ views
The authorities agreed to effect a modest tightening of fiscal and monetary policies to bring
down inflation. They intend to delay a large government wage increase planned for 2007 and
compress other expenditures as much as possible. The central bank will more actively mop up
excess liquidity and will aim to slow down the nominal depreciation of the currency.
The authorities acknowledged that fiscal policy, if unchanged, was unsustainable, and that the
key to achieving sustainability lies with increasing non-oil revenues and rationalizing spending,
including the elimination of fuel subsidies. They noted that the latter was likely to be delayed
due to political economy considerations and weaknesses in the social safety net. Efforts to
improve tax collection faced strong opposition from the business community. The authorities
were hopeful that new oil and gas reserves could ease the adjustment process.
Staff recommendations
Staff welcomed the authorities’ efforts to reduce inflation, but argued that some nominal
appreciation in the short run could help bring down inflation further, also as the exchange rate
appears slightly undervalued. Eliminating the minimum interest rate for local currency deposits
would allow for a more active interest rate policy and would enhance financial intermediation.
Staff urged the authorities to consider a more front-loaded fiscal adjustment, by taking early
steps to reduce fuel subsidies and making stronger efforts to raise non-oil tax revenues. Staff
stressed, however, that reducing fuel subsidies should be accompanied by measures to
strengthen the social safety net to mitigate the impact on the poor.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Yemen remains one of the poorest countries in the Middle East. It is ranked 150th
out of 177 countries in the 2006 United Nations Human Development Index. Strong oil
revenues, especially in recent years, have permitted large increases in government spending.
Together with sizable private

transfers, this has contributed to a

High oil revenues have reduced the urgency to advance economic reforms. The
pace of implementation of IMF recommendations has slowed down significantly since the end
of the last Fund-supported program in 2001 (Box 1).
3.
Relations with the international community have strengthened in recent years.
External official assistance to Yemen has started to increase again, although aid has been
relatively low in per capita terms. A Consultative Group (CG) meeting held November 2006 in
London succeeded in generating almost $5 billion in pledges (23 percent of 2006 GDP,
Text Table 1), underwriting a large part of Yemen’s Public Investment Program (PIP)
for 2007–10.

Box 1. Implementation of Past IMF Recommendations
Fiscal policy: A General Sales Tax (GST) was introduced in 2007, after seven years of preparation, but
with concessions regarding the valuation of imports to gain support from the business community. Full
implementation is now envisaged only in early 2009. Customs tariffs were substantially reduced
in 2006. Generous tax exemptions remain. The tax administration is moving towards a functionalbased organizational structure and use of self assessment, but progress has been slow. A large tax payer
unit was established. The authorities have not begun phasing out fuel subsidies, except for a one-time
increase in domestic fuel prices in July 2005.
Monetary and exchange rate policy: Full liberalization of interest rates is yet to be implemented.
Monetary policy remains geared more toward targeting the exchange rate than toward controlling
inflation. Banking sector supervision needs to be strengthened and staff has repeatedly encouraged the
authorities to request an update of the 2001 FSAP.
Structural reforms: Staff has called for reforms that boost private sector growth through improving
the business climate and governance. New procurement legislation and implementation regulations
have been prepared.
Macroeconomic data: Progress has been made in improving statistics, notably in monetary, balance of
payments, and fiscal data, but further efforts are needed to improve the quality, timeliness and
dissemination of Yemen’s statistics. Areas particularly in need of improvement include national
accounts and price statistics.

Half of the pledges came from Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. The authorities are
working to finalize the individual project agreements with each of the donors. Yemen was
reinstated in the U.S.’s Millennium Challenge Corporation’s threshold program.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.

Economic performance was generally favorable in 2006, but inflation accelerated:

•

Output is estimated to have grown by about 4 percent, with almost 6 percent non-oil
growth offsetting an 8 percent decline in oil production (Table 1 and Figure 1).

•

Core annual average inflation (excluding the volatile prices of the narcotic qat) rose to
over 20 percent, after a decade of relatively stable inflation in the 10–12 percent range.
This partly reflected exogenous supply factors, particularly a rise in world food prices.
But buoyant domestic demand, driven by high government spending—including a large
wage increase—and rapid money growth, also played a major role.

Government expenditures fueled domestic demand, as higher-than-budgeted oil
revenues were largely spent (Tables 2 and 3, Figure 2). As in 2005, the additional oil

Monetary policy was accommodative. With sizable government spending out of high oil
revenues, the real exchange rate has continued to appreciate, by 10 percent. But with the
Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) targeting a very slow, but steady depreciation of the
exchange rate, similar to a de facto crawling peg—the rial depreciated a little less than

The current account surplus remained broadly unchanged, at over 3 percent of GDP,
with record-high oil receipts partially offset by imports related to sizable investment in
the gas sector (Table 5). With the latter financed through foreign direct investment, the
high oil revenues resulted in a large reserve accumulation by the CBY. Gross reserves
increased by $1.5 billion to $6.8 billion by year end, the equivalent of about 11 months
of imports.

5.
Inflationary pressures eased in early 2007, partly reflecting seasonal factors, but
also because government spending was contained in the first quarter. Twelve-month core
inflation fell to 12 percent in May 2007, mainly reflecting a very large drop in the prices of
vegetables due to good rains. Annual average core inflation still stood at 20 percent in May.
Partial data suggest that government spending remained below budgeted amounts in the first
few months of the year as oil exports lagged behind annual forecasts. With less inflows, money
growth slowed down, to 25 percent by end-May.
6.
The approved 2007 budget envisages a significant increase in the deficit, to
6 percent of GDP. The budget maintains high spending levels and includes another wage
increase of 20–25 percent, despite a sharp drop in oil revenues due to declining production and
prices. Consolidating the PIP and related donor flows (which were not included in the budget)
with the budget would further increase the overall deficit to 7 percent of GDP.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
7.
Against this backdrop, the 2007 Article IV consultation discussions focused on
three key macroeconomic challenges:
•

bringing inflation down to levels below 10 percent, to prevent expectations of high
inflation from becoming entrenched;

10
•

achieving fiscal sustainability in the context of declining oil reserves; and

•

promoting nonhydrocarbon growth to create employment opportunities and help
achieve a lasting reduction in poverty.
A. Policies for 2007: Reducing Inflation

8.
The authorities recognized the need to reduce inflation and agreed to undertake a
modest tightening of fiscal and monetary policies. They realized that the planned wage
increase would fuel inflation pressures. They agreed to delay the increase, at least until the
associated civil service reforms (including the introduction of biometric cards) are fully
implemented (expected by early or mid-2008 for most ministries). However, military wages
were raised already, in light of the recent violence in the northern part of the country. Other
nonwage current spending will be compressed. The authorities will also consider some
streamlining of the budget’s own capital spending with the start of some of the (off-budget)
development projects financed from last year’s CG pledges. Combined, these actions could
reduce the 2007 budget deficit by some 2 percent of GDP. The CBY will resume issuing
treasury bills in amounts above those required to finance the budget deficit, to mop up excess
liquidity, and may resort to issuing its own certificates of deposit as well. With implementation
of these measures, staff estimates that core inflation, which ended 2006 at 22 percent, could be
reduced to about 12–14 percent by end-2007.
9.
To help bring down inflation more firmly, especially as the wage increase will only
be delayed, staff urged the authorities to allow some nominal appreciation of the rial and
to liberalize, and possibly raise, interest rates. Yemen is a highly dollarized and largely cashoriented economy, with a strong exchange rate pass-through, which makes the exchange rate a
more effective monetary tool to influence inflation (and the incentives to dollarize) than interest
rate policy. With CBY foreign exchange reserves at a comfortable level, staff advised the CBY
to increase its sales of foreign exchange in order to at least halt the depreciation of the rial, but
possibly even to allow some nominal appreciation in the short run, as the rial seems to be
moderately undervalued at the present time (Box 2).
10.
The authorities agreed to slow the rate of depreciation of the rial, but were
reluctant to allow a nominal appreciation, for fear of losing reserves and hurting
competitiveness. Mindful of the prospective decline in oil reserves over the medium term, the
authorities wish to preserve foreign exchange reserves as much as possible. Staff acknowledged
that competitiveness, which already appears low (Figure 3), could suffer, but argued that the
adverse impact of high inflation on the overall economy was likely to outweigh any dampening
effects of an appreciation on non-oil exports. Moreover, competitiveness could be undermined
as much from inflation as from a stronger exchange rate.

11
Box 2. Exchange Rate Regime and Level
The nominal exchange rate of the rial vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar has been slowly, but steadily depreciating over
the past several years, in a de facto crawling peg, in which the rate of crawl has recently slowed to resemble a
conventional peg. While the rial depreciated by on average 3¼ percent per year since 2000, the rate of depreciation
slowed to a little less than 2 percent in 2006 and to 1 percent in the 12 months through June 2007. Most of Yemen’s
foreign exchange inflows accrue to the CBY. The CBY supplies foreign exchange to the market through its foreign
exchange auctions, which are held irregularly and infrequently. The timing of, and the amounts sold at, the auctions
are determined so to achieve a slow depreciation. The authorities, however, maintain that the exchange rate regime
is an independent float and that the rial is appropriately valued.

There is no evidence of a major exchange rate misalignment. Yemen’s real effective exchange rate (REER) has
been appreciating as in many oil-producing countries, but this appreciation has come primarily through higher
inflation, given the CBY’s exchange rate policy. Estimates of the equilibrium REER (subject to very large margins
of statistical uncertainty) based on the Consultative Group on Exchange Rate’s equilibrium real exchange rate
approach suggest a modest undervaluation of Yemen’s REER by about 5 percent in 2006, well within the margin of
error.
Over time, if Yemen’s oil runs out, the equilibrium real exchange rate can be expected to be much more
depreciated than today. An assessment of Yemen’s REER factoring in the decline in oil production, suggests that
the equilibrium REER may be some 30–40 percent more depreciated over the longer term than its current level.

11.
The authorities were also hesitant to liberalize interest rates and pursue a more
active interest rate policy. They fear that eliminating the minimum interest rate for rial
deposits would reduce demand for rial holdings and put pressure on the rial. In staff’s view, the
minimum rate has effectively acted as a benchmark for all rates, and liberalizing interest rates,
and allowing them to rise (until inflation is sufficiently reduced), combined with some nominal
appreciation, could actually strengthen the incentive to de-dollarize.

B. Medium-Term Policies: Ensuring Fiscal Sustainability
12.
While the authorities are placing high hopes on finding new oil and gas reserves,
they agreed that fiscal policy needs to be based on conservative estimates of existing
reserves (Box 3). Exploration activities have intensified and any major oil or gas finds could
significantly change Yemen’s outlook. Conservative estimates, shared by the authorities, of
remaining recoverable hydrocarbon reserves, however, show that oil reserves could be depleted
within some 10 years. A large liquefied natural gas (LNG) project will offer some
compensation, but does not fundamentally alter the country’s outlook. Oil revenues constituted
three-fourths of government revenues in 2006, or almost 28 percent of GDP. Over the coming
years, the budget will lose on average about 2 percentage points of GDP in hydrocarbon
revenues each year.
13.
The authorities acknowledged that current policies are not sustainable over the
medium term and may lead to domestic and external instability. Staff presented a scenario
of unchanged fiscal policies (Text Table 3). Under this scenario, the fiscal deficit would rise
from less than 1 percent of GDP in 2006 to 20 percent of GDP by 2012. Assuming that these
deficits could be financed, net public debt would rise from a manageable level of 31 percent of
GDP to almost 75 percent of GDP over the same period, putting Yemen at a high risk of debt
distress. An increasing part of the deficit would likely need to be financed by the CBY and
inflation would accelerate. Growth would suffer.

14
Box 3. Hydrocarbon Sector Developments and Prospects
Yemen is a small oil producer, but the country is highly dependent on developments in its oil and gas
industry. Oil accounts for three-fourths of government revenue, and over 90 percent of export receipts.
60 percent of production is concentrated in two of the twelve producing blocks, Masila and Marib. As of
end-2006, proven reserves (1p) amounted to 671 million barrels, while “probable and possible” (2p+3p)
reserves amounted to 883 million barrels. Assuming a 50 percent probability for the latter, remaining
reserves would amount to some 1.1 billion barrels.
Official projections show a continuous decline in oil production. After peaking at 159 million barrels in
2000, production started to decline and fell to 130 million barrels in 2006. The slowdown is mostly
associated with the maturing of the Masila and Marib fields. At current rates of production and reserve
levels, proven reserves would be depleted by 2013. Adding 50 percent of probable and possible reserves, oil
would run out by 2018. With growing domestic demand, Yemen would need to import petroleum products
by 2015, when demand would exceed the government share of oil production.
The production and export of liquefied natural gas will not fully offset the expected decline in oil
production. The LNG project will produce and export 6.7 million tons of LNG, the equivalent of some
60 million barrels of oil per year, starting in 2009, for at least 20 years. The project has an estimated
investment of around $4 billion, entailing substantial imports of capital equipment during 2006–09.

A major new find could significantly alter Yemen’s outlook. Current oil producing fields comprise only
4 percent of Yemen’s overall territory. An additional 15 percent (26 blocks) of Yemen’s territory is currently
under exploration, with more to follow. So far, exploration activities have not resulted in any major
discovery, but most have just started. Meanwhile, the authorities and oil companies are aiming to improve
the recovery ratio of existing fields. Based on current technologies, some 40 percent of the estimated oil in
place could be economically recovered from the existing fields. While less dramatic, increasing this ratio
could add a few years to Yemen’s oil horizon.

14.
The authorities realized the need for a large fiscal adjustment effort. They agreed
that the key for achieving sustainability lies in increasing non-oil revenues and a rationalization
of government expenditures. Notably, fuel subsidies remain a big burden, taking up one-fifth of
government spending. Staff also presented an adjustment scenario consistent with fiscal
sustainability, aiming to keep the public debt-to-GDP ratio below 50 percent over the medium
to long term. This implies that the non-oil primary deficit would need to be reduced on average
by almost 2 percent of GDP per year for the coming years, limiting the overall deficit on
average to 3–4 percent of GDP annually. Key measures include (i) the phased elimination of
fuel subsidies in three years, accompanied by measures to safeguard the poor; (ii) a broadening
of the tax base, including by eliminating tax exemptions, full implementation of the GST and
increasing its rate from 5 to 10 percent, and introducing a fuel tax; (iii) civil service reform to
contain the wage bill; and (iv) a streamlining of capital spending, while improving the quality
of spending. Even with strong adjustment, vulnerabilities would remain, given the still
relatively large overall fiscal deficits.

16
15.
The authorities broadly accepted the staff’s adjustment scenario, but noted that
implementation was likely to be slower due to political economy considerations. The
authorities emphasized that while they intend to tackle the fuel subsidies in due course, they
did not want to risk domestic instability, especially in light of the recent conflict in the north,
the already high rates of inflation, and the weak social safety net. A fuel price increase in 2005
triggered strong and violent protests that resulted in considerable loss of life. The authorities
could not give a specific time frame for fuel price increases. They have requested the World
Bank to provide several scenarios for how to reduce the subsidies. Staff urged the authorities to
start raising domestic fuel prices as soon as possible, and argued that the planned government
wage increase could provide a good opportunity, but acknowledged that it should be done only
in conjunction with improved targeting of the benefits provided by the Social Welfare Fund
(SWF) and that part of the savings should be used to increase benefit levels and the number of
beneficiaries. Work is currently underway to improve the targeting of the SWF, with technical
assistance from the European Union. As part of this work, a revised law on social assistance
will be submitted to parliament before end-2007.
16.
Reforms aimed at increasing non-oil revenues by broadening the tax base and
improving compliance are progressing, albeit slowly. The long-delayed GST is being
implemented at 5 percent, but with concessions to overcome strong opposition from the
powerful business community, which controls a number of key parliamentary committees.
Full implementation will now start in 2009. The authorities also intend to reduce the corporate
income tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent later this year, to bring it more in line with
neighboring countries, while simultaneously removing all existing exemptions in the income
tax, customs, and investment laws, to avoid revenue losses. Because this also needs to pass the
same parliamentary committees, there is a risk that at least some exemptions may remain.
Efforts to modernize the tax administration, in line with FAD recommendations, to move to a
self-assessment environment are continuing slowly, but are hampered by the generally poor
state of record keeping by businesses.
17.
The authorities have started an ambitious and comprehensive two-year public
financial management reform program. This program has been developed with assistance
from a group of donors. It aims to strengthen spending control, including by establishing a
single treasury account, and to improve budget preparation, execution and reporting. In this
regard, starting with the preparations for the 2008 budget, the authorities will cast their annual
budget within an explicit medium-term macro framework and a three-year rolling MediumTerm Expenditure Framework.
C. Medium-Term Policies: Promoting Sustained Nonhydrocarbon Growth
18.
As oil production declines, new sources of growth will need to be found, especially
to absorb the rapidly growing labor force. While donor-financed projects will help boost
non-oil growth in the coming years, the authorities are appropriately focusing on establishing
an environment conducive to private investment as key to creating new employment
opportunities and broadening the tax as well as the export base. In this context, a one-stop shop
for new businesses will be established at the General Investment Authority. Continued reforms
in the tax and customs administration, the new procurement legislation, and the creation of a

17
national anticorruption authority will help address governance concerns. The authorities
recently committed to join the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) with a view
to further enhance transparency in the oil sector. The authorities also aim to improve the skill
set of the relatively young Yemeni labor force by strengthening vocational training.
19.
The authorities recognized that sustained growth also requires a much higher level
of financial intermediation than currently exists in Yemen. By end-2006, credit to the
private sector amounted to only 7 percent of GDP. Strong reforms will be needed to enhance
financial intermediation, including the removal of the minimum interest rate for rial deposits
(see above). Banks are also reluctant to lend because of weak mechanisms for contract
enforcement, and typically lend only to well-known clients. As a result, high loan concentration
ratios, as well as high levels of nonperforming loans, remain a concern (Text Table 4).
Measures are needed to strengthen property rights and contract enforcement, and create a
transparent and effective judicial system. At the same time, banking supervision needs to be
strengthened further, focusing also on the growing share of Islamic banks in Yemen’s financial
system. The authorities expressed interest in a Financial Sector Assessment update, to assess
vulnerabilities and identify areas in need of further reform and assistance. Revisions to the Anti
Money Laundering (AML) law, prepared with assistance of the UN, the World Bank, and the
IMF are to be sent to parliament shortly.

D. Data and Other Issues
20.
The authorities expressed strong interest in a multi-sector statistics mission to
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the macroeconomic statistics and develop a
strategy for improving the quality and timeliness of data. Shortcomings complicating
economic analysis are concentrated in the real sector (national account statistics, wages, and, to
some extent, prices). Long delays in the availability of data are prevalent in almost all sectors.
Staff also recommended that the authorities request a fiscal ROSC, with a view to increasing
fiscal transparency, including an assessment of resource revenue issues as a useful complement
to the EITI.
21.
Yemen has a very open trade regime and is seeking to enhance trade integration.
Most imports are subject to a 5 percent import tariff, while the highest rate is 25 percent. The
Yemeni authorities hope to finalize discussions on accession to the World Trade Organization
in the near future, pending further bilateral talks, and are also looking to strengthen linkages
with the GCC countries.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
22.
The Yemeni authorities face considerable challenges to promote strong economic
growth to create new employment opportunities and reduce poverty, while ensuring fiscal
and external sustainability in the context of declining oil reserves. Although the country’s
outlook could be significantly altered by the discovery of new oil and gas reserves, the
authorities appropriately base their policies on existing hydrocarbon reserves.
23.
The envisaged tightening of fiscal and monetary policies will help reduce inflation.
Fiscal restraint is particularly important to avoid placing the entire burden to achieve
single-digit inflation on monetary policy.
24.
Monetary policy should focus more closely on achieving low inflation. Monetary
targeting is hazardous, because of the economy’s low monetization and high dollarization and
conditions in Yemen are not suitable for formal inflation targeting. The CBY must therefore
continue to rely to a considerable extent on the exchange rate as its nominal anchor. Swings in
the country’s equilibrium exchange rate brought about by oil price increases (in the short run)
or by declining oil production (in the long run) may require that the exchange rate anchor be
allowed to move up, or down, as needed to achieve low inflation, rather than always follow a
(more or less) steady nominal depreciation.
25.
To help bring down inflation more swiftly, the CBY could allow some nominal
appreciation of the rial in the short run. The exchange rate appears to be slightly
undervalued at the present time. In recent years, all of Yemen’s real exchange rate appreciation
was realized through higher inflation relative to its partner countries. It would be preferable for
any real appreciation to become manifest in a stronger rial, rather than in inflation. A
strengthening rial could also reduce the incentives to dollarize. Eventually, however, as oil
production declines, a downward adjustment of the nominal exchange rate may be needed to
bring about a depreciation of the real effective exchange rate so as to allow Yemen to become
more competitive in the supply of nonhydrocarbon goods and services.

19
26.
The minimum interest rate for rial deposits should be removed to allow the CBY
to conduct a more active interest rate policy and to enhance financial intermediation.
Deepening financial markets will be essential for ensuring strong non-oil growth. Commercial
bank credit operations would be enhanced by better contract enforcement, improved collateral
arrangements, and strengthened property rights. Banking supervision and AML controls need
to be strengthened as well and an FSAP update would help to assess potential risks and develop
an agenda for financial sector reforms.
27.
Yemen’s fiscal policies will need to adjust to the prospective decline in oil
production and revenues. Absent such an adjustment, Yemen would risk domestic and
external instability. Although Yemen’s relatively low debt burden and large foreign exchange
reserves allow for some delays in the adjustment process, a more front-loaded effort than
envisaged by the authorities would avoid the need for more abrupt changes later on. The most
difficult and at the same time the most pressing measure is raising domestic fuel prices. This
should go hand in hand with substantial improvements in the social safety net. Stronger efforts
will also be needed to increase non-oil revenues—and especially to overcome opposition from
the local business community to new tax measures—and to improve the quality and
effectiveness of capital spending. Even with strong adjustment, Yemen will remain vulnerable
to downside risks, including lower oil prices and slower non-oil growth.
28.
Yemen will need strong economic growth to achieve a significant reduction in
unemployment and poverty. At the moment, Yemen does not appear to be competitive in
non-oil exports, which remain low. Productivity-enhancing reforms are urgently needed to
enhance competitiveness, including further efforts to improve the investment climate and the
quality of labor. Such reforms would need to encompass further actions to address governance
concerns and red tape, including in tax and customs administration.
29.
Data provision is still adequate for surveillance, but improvements are needed to
better facilitate the formulation and monitoring of economic policies. Notably, real sector
statistics should be a priority area for improvement, but further technical assistance will also
continue to be needed in other areas to improve the quality and timeliness of data.
30.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation discussions be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Safeguards Assessment:

Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) was subject
to the transitional procedures with respect to the EFF arrangement which expired on
October 28, 2001. The assessment, which was completed on May 23, 2001, concluded that
CBY’s external audit mechanism was not fully adequate at the time, and recommendations were
made to address the shortcomings. The CBY has submitted assessment letters and its audited
financial statements up to 2006.
VIII.

Exchange Arrangements:

The currency of Yemen is the Yemeni rial. The Yemeni authorities maintain that the current
exchange rate system is a free float. However, staff are of the view that the exchange rate system
is a facto crawling peg, in which the rate of crawl has recently slowed to resemble a conventional
peg. Accordingly, under the IMF’s classification, Yemen is currently considered a de facto
conventional peg.
Yemen has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Articles of
Agreement and maintains an exchange system that is free of multiple currency practices and
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. In
accordance with UN Security Council Resolutions, Yemen has taken measures to block the
accounts of certain individuals and organizations and has notified the Fund of these measures in
accordance with Decision 144.

ANNEX II. REPUBLIC OF YEMEN: WORLD BANK RELATIONS
A.

Partnership in Yemen’s Development Strategy

1.
Relations between the World Bank and the Government of Yemen are close and continue
to cover knowledge and lending services in sectors critical to development and poverty reduction.
The Bank’s Board of Directors discussed the 2006-2009 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for
Yemen in June 2006. This CAS was prepared after extensive consultations with central and local
government officials, civil society, private sector and other donors. It also benefited from the
Government’s Progress Report for the first two years of implementation of the First Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (2003-2005) as well as the 2006 Country Assistance Evaluation
prepared by the Independent Evaluation Group of the World Bank.
2.
The CAS is based on four pillars: (a) increasing non-oil growth; (b) improving human
development outcomes; (c) improving fiscal sustainability; and (d) addressing the resource
sustainability crisis. During the CAS period, IDA intends to provide about $100 million annually
in credits to Yemen through a selective program of lending operations complemented by a
strategic program of analytical and learning services. Given the relatively limited amount of IDA
resources available to Yemen, the Bank’s larger contribution comes from its catalytic role in
leveraging donors’ resources, providing technical assistance to the Government and working with
other donors to mainstream new implementation approaches that can enhance sectoral
performance.
3.
In mid-November 2006, the World Bank co-chaired with the Yemen’s Government a
Consultative Group (CG) meeting hosted by the UK Department of International Development,
and sponsored by the Gulf Cooperation. The CG was attended by senior officials from
39 countries and international development agencies, and a total amount of US$4.7 billion were
pledged to finance Yemen’s development for the four year period 2007-2010. The pledge
represented over 85 percent of the Government’s estimated external financing needs.
4.
As part of the CAS, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of
the World Bank Group, is supporting the development of the private sector in Yemen through
investments and technical assistance activities. The IFC focuses on enhancing competitiveness of
the private sector, further deepening the financial sector, promoting investments in areas newly
opened for private sector participation, encouraging sustainable social and environmental
development, and promoting good corporate governance.
B.

Status of the World Bank Portfolio

5.
IDA. As of March 31, 2007, IDA had approved 136 projects for Yemen, valued at about
US$2.3 billion (excluding grants and cancellations), of which about US$2.0 billion have been
disbursed. The current portfolio has 18 active projects with a total net commitment of about
US$748 million, of which US$447 million are undisbursed. The sectoral composition (by value)
of the current portfolio is as follows: 50 percent for infrastructure projects, 17 percent for
agriculture, 17 percent for education, 12 percent for health/social protection, and 4 percent for
public sector governance. Over the last two years, portfolio performance has remained stable—
disbursement ratio has so far reached 21 percent and is expected to rise to about 26 percent by the
end of FY07. Out of 18 projects in the portfolio, only one project is rated problematic for issues

5
on financial management. Recent actions taken, including project management changes, are
expected to address the issues affecting that project.
6.
IFC. In response to Government of Yemen’s efforts in opening certain industries to
private participation, IFC has recently increased its investment operations in the country with two
relatively large investments in FY06, and has a strong pipeline in FY07, including Trade Finance
lines for commercial banks. In FY06, IFC committed US$60 million with two projects
(US$35 million in the HSA National Cement Company, a green-field cement plant and a
US$25 million investment in SOCO, an oil and gas project). In FY07, IFC already committed
US$20 million for the Saudi German Hospital and US$10 million for a trade finance line with the
Saba Islamic Bank. IFC is focusing on working with strong local private groups in Yemen, in
particular, on the underdeveloped financial sector, banking, leasing, trade finance and selected
industries.
7.
Relation with the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA): Currently, MIGA
does not have any activities in Yemen. However, the ministry of planning and international
cooperation has recently requested assistance to review its institutional framework for investment
promotion. In response, FIAS/MIGA is planning a rapid diagnostic assessment of the overall
investment promotion institutional arrangements in Yemen with a view to offering
recommendations for the rationalization of roles, mandates and functions in this important
strategic area of activity.

ANNEX III. REPUBLIC OF YEMEN: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Delays in reporting and data weaknesses persist, and in some cases are getting worse;
but data is still adequate to conduct surveillance. Due to shortcomings in most data, a broad
effort is in place to improve data compilation with technical assistance from the Fund and
other donors. In particular, national accounts data should be a priority for reform and
improvement.
2.
The Republic of Yemen has participated in the General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS) since April 26, 2001. While some progress has been made, scope remains to
improve the collection and dissemination of economic statistics, in line with Yemen’s
commitments under the GDDS.
3.
The most reliable and timely data are those on the monetary sector produced by the
Central Bank of Yemen (CBY). The CBY disseminates data on total official reserve assets
and monetary statistics with a lag of one month. To strengthen monetary statistics further, a
multisector mission in August 2000 recommended that: (a) repurchase agreements be treated
as collateralized loans; (b) all nonstandard loans be reclassified as claims on the relevant
sector; (c) counterparty for several monetary accounts be more accurately identified; and
(d) a number of monetary accounts be disaggregated so as to present position on a single
financial instrument. In June 2003, the authorities began reporting to STA a more
disaggregated set of data that allowed for improved sectoral and instrument classification.
Publication of the revised monetary statistics for December 1999 and onward, based on the
more detailed data reporting, began in the August 2003 issue of IFS. In March 2007, with the
availability of more detailed data, the definition of broad money was broadened to include
the deposits of the pension funds, starting with data for December 1999. CBY does not yet
report monetary data to STA using Standardized Report Forms (SRFs).
4.
Although important progress has been achieved in terms of coverage, classification,
and compilation methods of national accounts in accordance with the System of National
Accounts 1993 (1993 SNA), significant work remains to be done to improve data quality and
compilation methods. Based on technical assistance provided by STA and METAC in real
sector statistics from September 2001 to November 2006, the Central Statistics Office (CSO)
has compiled national accounts statistics for the years 1999–2005 that include: current
accounts and the capital account by institutional sector; goods and services account and the
integrated economic accounts for the total economy; and supply and use tables (SUT). The
compilation of the SUT for 2004 is well underway. Most of the production and expenditure
estimates are now based on direct methods that mainly use the results of recently conducted
surveys, albeit with considerable lags. Quarterly establishment sample surveys to provide
short-term indicators for moving annual benchmark series are underway and may be
implemented in 2008. A household expenditure and income survey was conducted in 2005,
and the results are expected to improve estimates of household final consumption and update
the weights of the CPI. Additional work is needed to ensure the accuracy and the speed of
collecting and processing survey results, to conduct new surveys in areas uncovered, to better
identify the informal sector and the unorganized units and to update survey samples to
improve coverage. There is also a need to develop short-term indicators for both current and
constant prices, and to apply the 1993 SNA framework consistently for all published national
accounts data.

7
5.
Regarding price statistics, some improvements have been made in the compilation of
the consumer price index and the production of foreign trade price indices. METAC is
currently assisting the CSO in developing a producer price index (PPI), however there has
been no agreement on a specific action plan in this area. With the assistance of STA,
the CSO has constructed a CPI that is consistent with international standards, with weights
derived from the 1998 Households Budget Survey (HBS). The CPI has a broad geographic
coverage and a sufficient number of consumption items, although some deficiencies remain
in data collection practices. STA real sector missions have recommended further improving
the sources of data in general, expanding the price statistics to cover different areas, and
enhancing training and internal coordination within the CSO. CSO staff are currently
working on updating the weights of the CPI basket to reflect the results of the 2005 HBS, and
are considering reducing the number of commodities in the basket from the current coverage
of 900 goods in the basket. To address problems in the field, the CSO has introduced a new
framework to ensure consistency in data collection according to the following criteria:
timing, good specifications, and location.
6.
Fiscal data reliability and timeliness remain weak—particularly for detailed revenue,
expenditure and financing items despite the provision of substantial technical assistance from
several international agencies to improve the source data, the accounting and budgeting
frameworks and information systems, and compilation methods. There are also discrepancies
between reported budget data and below-the-line financing data obtained from the monetary
statistics and CBY’s BOP data. Fiscal data dissemination is limited to the hardcopy
publication of the quarterly Bulletin of Government Finance Statistics (Bulletin), which
provides annual, quarterly, and monthly data with significant lags. The authorities have not
reported data for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook from 2000
onwards, and the latest data are estimates for 1999. No sub-annual data are reported for
publication in International Financial Statistics. The GFS mission which visited Sana’a in
January 2004 found that the available statistics, while disseminated with greater coverage
and detail than previously, continued to suffer from numerous departures from international
standards in classification and coverage. The mission encouraged the authorities to enhance
the Bulletin of Government Finance Statistics with additional information on financing and
on debt. The mission also recommended that the authorities expand their data dissemination
by communicating the Bulletin, or the relevant data therein, to the IMF Statistics Department
for re-dissemination and for the purpose of renewing the dialogue and remote technical
assistance for the development of their GFS. Fiscal data based on the 2001 GFSM
methodology have been compiled but have not been widely disseminated.
7.
The CBY is responsible for compiling and disseminating balance of payments
statistics, and more recently, the international investment position (IIP) statistics based on the
IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition. Compilation tasks are performed on a
rather ad hoc basis, mostly relying on survey-based questionnaires with a response rate that is
generally poor. The quality of the questionnaires themselves is also weak due to the limited
expertise and experience in developing such material. Further compounding the weak quality
of the statistics are inadequacies in documented sources and methods, and the limited
financial and material resources dedicated to balance of payments compilation. The CBY
publishes quarterly external debt statistics within one quarter of the reference period for the
banking sector, general government, and monetary authority. Successive STA balance of
payments statistics missions (2002, 2003, and 2005) have sought to facilitate implementation

8
of the action plan recommended by the IMF’s resident advisor on balance of payments
statistics (1998–2000), with only limited success. Coverage of the oil and gas industry
transactions remains weak. Data questionnaires on FDI and selected items in services have
either been discontinued or not followed up. The shortage of qualified staff dedicated to the
compilation as well as weak coordination between the CBY and other government agencies
(such as the customs authority, the CSO, and the ministry of oil and mining resources) are
partly responsible for the slow progress.STA missions have consistently called for better
coordination between the CBY and other government agencies for timely and effective data
collection and compilation, improved staffing and training, and the reinstitution of
discontinued surveys. A balance of payments mission in September 2005 found that the CBY
had made some progress on increasing manpower and equipment in the balance of payments
division, as well as training through the AMF. The mission also focused on the present
method of estimating inward worker’s remittances. Yemen has submitted quarterly balance
of payments data to STA until end-2006, although the latest data published in the IFS and
Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook (BOPSY) relate to end-2005. Quarterly IIP data has
also been supplied to STA for 2003 and 2004.

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
Joint World Bank/IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the Staff of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association
Approved by Adam Bennett and Adnan Mazarei (IMF)
and Mustapha Nabli and Vikram Nehru (IDA)
August 30, 2007
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This Debt SustainabilityAnalysis (DSA) finds Yemen to face a high risk of (external)
debt distress. The probability of debt distress is particularly high if the authorities do not embark
upon a major fiscal adjustment effort in light of the dwindling oil reserves, even though debt levels
are currently still manageable. With unchanged policies, debt ratios would rapidly deteriorate and
exceed thresholds within a few years. But even under the baseline scenario that assumes full
implementation of a comprehensive set of fiscal and structural reforms (Box 1), debt thresholds
would be either approached within the DSA horizon (Net Present Value (NPV) of external debt-toGDP ratio) or breached (NPV of external debt-to-exports ratio). This is amplified in the standard
DSA stress tests (and also under an additional stress test that simulates a lower oil price), especially
if financing would only be available on moderately concessional terms. In other words, if Yemen is
to avoid debt distress, this will require strong fiscal and structural reforms, as well as highly
concessional financing.
II. METHODOLOGY
2.
The DSA uses the debt sustainability framework for low-income countries (www.imf.org).
Debt sustainability is assessed in relation to policy-dependent debt burden thresholds. According to
the average Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index over 2004–06, Yemen is
classified as a medium performer in terms of its policies and institutions.1
3.
The DSA is based on the staff’s adjustment (baseline) and nonadjustment scenarios. The
adjustment scenario assumes full implementation of fiscal reforms over the medium term (2007-12),
which are assumed to be continued and intensified as Yemen’s oil reserves run out by 2018. The
nonadjustment scenario assumes the absence of fiscal adjustment, as reflected by a broadly
unchanged non-oil primary balance. Both scenarios are based on identical conservative estimates of
1

For a medium performer, the indicative thresholds for external debt sustainability are an NPV of debt-to-export ratio
of 150 percent, an NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio of 40 percent, an NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio of 250 percent, a debt
service-to-exports ratio of 20 percent, and a debt service-to-revenue ratio of 30 percent.

2
proven oil and gas reserves. Since the nonadjustment scenario is clearly unsustainable, stress tests
are applied to the adjustment scenario to assess whether any vulnerabilities would remain when the
authorities implement a strong package of reforms. In discussions with the Yemeni authorities, they
broadly accepted the adjustment scenario as the way forward, but noted that implementation was
likely to be delayed due to political economy considerations.
III. BACKGROUND
4.
This DSA updates the previous DSA by allowing for more informed estimates of
government revenues from the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) project and LNG export receipts, use
of actual 2006 debt data for both public and external debt, estimates of new disbursements as
pledged in the 2006 Consultative Group (CG) meeting in London, and resolution of some bilateral
debt issues since then. In particular, debt to India will be paid in full as a lump sum. Debt to
Hungary has been fully paid. Debt to Iraq is being serviced on schedule following an agreement
reached with the Iraqi authorities. Agreements still have to be reached with China, Kuwait, and the
Arab Fund for Social and Economic Development. In addition, Yemen may benefit substantially
from future grants from the Millennium Challenge Corporation, pending progress in its reforms.
IV. THE CURRENT SITUATION
5.
Yemen’s total external public debt, based on data from the debt unit of the Central Bank of
Yemen (CBY), stood at $5,469 million (27.3 percent of GDP) by end 2006, an increase of $300
million over end-2005, which was mostly due to new IDA borrowings (Table 1). Debt to IDA
accounts for about 35 percent of Yemen’s external debt and some 67 percent of multilateral debt.
Among Yemen’s bilateral creditors, the Russian Federation is the largest (32 percent of total
external debt), followed by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia (6 percent each). Yemen benefited from a
series of rescheduling arrangements under the Paris Club in 1996, 1997, and 2001.

Yemen’s stock of gross domestic public debt stood at about 11 percent of GDP at
end-2006, consisting primarily of T-bills of various maturities held by nonbanks (two-thirds) and
banks (one-third). Net domestic debt (net of government deposits) was 4 percent of GDP at
end-2006, resulting in a total net public debt stock of 31.4 percent (38.9 percent gross) at end-2006.

3

Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions for the Adjustment Scenario
Yemen is highly dependent on oil. In 2006, oil receipts accounted for 74 percent of fiscal revenues and
92 percent of merchandise export revenues. By 2018, when Yemen is expected to run out of oil, hydrocarbon
revenues (from LNG exports and the domestic sale of gas) are projected to decline to 30 percent of total
government revenues and export receipts to 54 percent of total exports. The current high dependence is not
sustainable. Maintaining fiscal sustainability is therefore an important concern underlying the adjustment
scenario.
In the medium term, the key spending reforms include an elimination of fuel subsidies by end-2010;
containment of the civil service wage bill and defense spending; better expenditure control and management,
as well as increases in social spending; and better targeting to protect the poor of the adverse effects of removal
of fuel subsidies and taxes on petroleum products. Significant revenue reforms include full implementation of
the General Sales Tax (doubling in 2009 to 10 percent from 5 percent); stepped-up reform of customs and tax
administration, rationalization or elimination of exemptions in the customs, income tax, and investment laws;
and imposition of a tax on petroleum products as fuel subsidies are phased out. The combined impact of tax
policy and tax administration measures is assumed to increase tax revenues from 6½ percent of GDP in 2006 to
11 percent in 2012. Average real GDP growth for this period is projected at 5 percent; the average fiscal deficit
at 3⅓ percent; and the average current account deficit at 2 percent of GDP. Oil prices are based on the most
recent WEO projections.
For the longer term, the following assumptions were made:
•

Overall real GDP growth will remain moderate, averaging 4 percent during 2013-27, with a
nonhydrocarbon growth of about 5 percent maintained through 2017 (through development of tourism,
manufactures, and fishing, and large public investment projects financed by CG money). The GDP
growth assumption is well within the bounds of historical experience (the average growth rate
over 1997–2006 was 4.5 percent, Table 2), and consistent with the reforms and adjustment envisioned
in the adjustment scenario—with the bulk of such reforms implemented over the medium term
(2007-12)—and projected external assistance. The baseline scenario projects nonhydrocarbon growth
(which will be the driving force after oil reserves are depleted) to average 4 percent over the long
term. By comparison, average nonhydrocarbon growth during 1991–2005 was 5.2 percent, and during
the reform years (1995–2001) was close to 6 percent.

•

The current account balance falls into sizeable deficits with the depletion of oil, but recovers
somewhat over the long term, reflecting a steady pick-up in non-oil exports (but which start from a
low base).

•

Most of the new revenue mobilization efforts are expected to be put in place over the medium term.
Beyond 2012, revenue enhancement has to be gained from further improvements in the efficiency of
indirect tax collection (GST, customs duties, excises on petroleum products), income taxes, as well as
a further increase in the GST rate to 13 percent, accompanied with a further strengthening of the tax
and customs administration through 2018. For the adjustment to be permanent and sustainable, these
gains need to be maintained and accompanied by further containment of public sector spending, as the
private sector is increasingly taking a larger role in the economy. Tax revenues are expected to reach
16 percent of GDP by 2027

•

Future external borrowings are assumed to come from official creditors at concessional terms.
Domestic borrowing is driven by the evolution of the government’s fiscal balance, and is assumed to
come from the bank and nonbank sector (including the pension fund) at positive real interest rates.

V. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
7.
Under unchanged policies, all three indicators show public debt to be unsustainable in
the medium term and to worsen markedly over time.
8.
Under the adjustment scenario, all three indicators increase over time. The NPV of
(net) public debt-to-GDP ratio rises markedly from 27½ percent of GDP at end-2006 to 31½ percent
in 2017, as the country runs out of oil, and rises further thereafter to a level of 43 percent in 2027. In
book value terms, the rise is more pronounced, with the (net) public debt-to-GDP ratio rising from
31½ percent of GDP in 2006 to 34 percent in 2017, accelerating to 47 percent in 2027, despite
expenditure cuts and consolidation of revenue gains.
9.
Stress tests show that, under an adjustment scenario, Yemen remains vulnerable to
shocks and to lapses in commitment to implementation of fiscal and structural measures to
accelerate fiscal adjustment and growth, particularly in the non-oil economy. Adverse shocks
(including an oil price shock developed specifically for this DSA) have quick and sizeable effects
on all three debt indicators and become more pronounced as Yemen runs out of oil. Yemen is
particularly sensitive to adverse oil price shocks as growth of nonhydrocarbon revenues and
nonhydrocarbon export receipts are too slow to enhance its debt capacity repayment.
VI. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
10.
Under the nonadjustment scenario, debt thresholds for the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio
and the NPV of debt-to-export ratio are permanently breached by 2012. The threshold for the
debt-service-to-exports ratio is permanently breached by 2018.
11.
Under the adjustment scenario, the NPV of external debt-to-GDP ratio increases
steadily and stabilizes at about 30 percent, but the breach of the threshold for the NPV of debt
to exports is sustained within the DSA horizon. Stress tests such as borrowings on less favorable
terms and an oil price shock can quickly translate into debt levels that exceed the threshold, and
which worsen further as Yemen runs out of oil. Two out of three indicators (NPV of debt-to-exports
and NPV of debt service-to-exports ratio) show protracted breaches of debt thresholds beyond 2018,
highlighting the need to accelerate the pace of nonhydrocarbon export growth well before Yemen
runs out of oil.
12.
Under the adjustment scenario, the debt service-to-export ratio remains below the
threshold of 20 percent. However, as with other indicators, it worsens as Yemen runs out of oil
reserves, increasing from 7½ percent in 2017 to 11 percent in 2018 and 14 percent in 2027.
Under stress testing, the threshold is breached in outer years, particularly under an adverse oil price
shock.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2007 Consultation
with the Republic of Yemen
Approved by Adam Bennett and Adnan Mazarei
September 13, 2007
1.
This supplement summarizes information that has become available since the staff
report for the 2007 Article IV consultation was circulated to the Board on August 20, 2007.
The additional information alters the thrust of the staff appraisal regarding the fiscal and
inflation outlook.
I. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
2.
Twelve-month inflation (excluding qat) fell further to 10.2 percent in June, from
12 percent in May. The Consumer Price Index (excluding qat) rose by almost 4 percent in
June, largely driven by higher prices of vegetables and edible oils, and to a lesser extent of
wheat and flour.
3.
In July and August, food prices, and especially of wheat and flour, are reported
to have further increased sharply. This reflects, in part, the rapid rise in wheat prices in
international markets during this period.
4.
Violent protests erupted in several cities in Yemen during the last few weeks,
with some reported fatalities. The protests were sparked by large price increases and high
unemployment.
5.
In response to the unrest, the authorities have announced measures aimed at
alleviating the impact of rising prices. Government workers received a one-month salary
bonus before Ramadan. In addition, the state-owned Yemen Economic Corporation, which
supplies foodstuffs to the military, was instructed to increase its wheat imports and to sell
them at cost to the general public. The authorities believe that wheat prices are partly driven
up by noncompetitive behavior of the main private trading firms. To enhance competition,
the authorities have also amended the Commercial Law to extend the right of importation of
wheat to fully foreign-owned firms. A World Bank analysis conducted earlier this year of the
operation of the markets for basic food staples, including wheat, however, did not find
evidence of anti-competitive behavior.

2
6.
Since June, the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) has stepped up its foreign
exchange sales and the exchange rate of the rial vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar has remained
broadly stable. This should help limit imported inflation somewhat. The net issuance of
treasury bills has also increased in recent months, with the net amount issued in the first
seven months of 2007 already reaching a level similar to that of 2006 as a whole. Preliminary
fiscal data for the first half of the year suggest that the increased issuance reflects a widening
fiscal deficit. Oil revenues have remained below budgeted amounts, despite the recent high
oil prices.

II. STAFF APPRAISAL
7.
The authorities’ decision to grant a one-month bonus to government employees
risks renewing inflationary pressures and makes achieving fiscal and debt sustainability
more difficult. The bonus will increase the budget deficit by about 0.6 percent of GDP, to
reach 5.2 percent of GDP in 2007. Last year, a similar bonus ahead of Ramadan helped push
prices up by 6 percent in both September and October. Staff is concerned that the bonus
could have a similar impact this year and drive inflation back up to well over 15 percent by
end-2007. Absent a stronger tightening of monetary policy, the target range of 12–14 percent
for core inflation by end-2007 no longer appears achievable.
8.
The government intervention in the wheat market should not have an impact on
the budget, but risks displacing private sector import activity. Staff welcomes the
authorities’ efforts to further enhance competition in the markets for basic food staples, but
urges them to withdraw from the wheat market as soon as possible. If the authorities wish to
cushion the future impact of high wheat prices on the poor, it would be preferable to do so
through the Social Welfare Fund, while continuing to address weaknesses in this system.

Statement by A. Shakour Shaalan, Executive Director for Republic of Yemen
September 17, 2007
1. At the outset, I would like to convey the Yemeni authorities' appreciation to the staff
and management for the constructive relationship with the Fund. They particularly
appreciate staff's collaborative engagement during the Article IV mission, and the
valuable policy advice and technical assistance they continue to receive from the
Fund. The authorities are mindful of the broad challenges facing the economy in the
medium and longer terms, and look forward to continued dialogue on the policy
priorities in the period ahead.
Background
2. A series of wide-ranging macroeconomic and structural reforms undertaken over the
past decade helped engender an economic transformation in Yemen. Chief among
these are the unification of the exchange rate, fiscal reforms, trade liberalization,
privatization of public sector enterprises, and financial sector reforms. The Fund has
played a critical role in assisting and promoting this process, which helped the
country achieve steady progress. These deep structural reforms have been pursued
alongside efforts to democratize the political process. Admittedly, tensions could
sometimes arise between the desirability of an ambitious pace of economic reforms
and the need to ensure their broader acceptance in the context of high levels of
poverty and unemployment. From this perspective, the introduction of the General
Sales Tax (GST) in 2007, as well as important structural reforms undertaken in
various areas are notable accomplishments since last year's consultation.
3. Notwithstanding these accomplishments, the authorities are intent on deepening the
economic transformation in order to address the challenges emanating from the
prospective depletion of oil reserves and the weaknesses in human and physical
capital. In view of the significant development needs, intensified donor support will
be critical in sustaining the authorities' efforts to tackle problems of widespread
poverty and limited institutional and implementation capacities. In this respect, the
Consultative Group (CG) meeting in November 2006 in London was an important
milestone, with pledges of about $5 billion financing about 85 percent of the
government's Public Investment Program for 2007-2010.
Recent Developments
4. Economic performance in 2006 continued to be broadly positive. Real GDP growth is
estimated at 4 percent, with growth in the non-hydrocarbon sector more than
offsetting a sizable contraction in oil production. Notwithstanding the latter, buoyant
oil prices helped keep the overall budget broadly in balance, although the non-oil
primary deficit registered a limited increase. Moreover, the external current account
continued to register a modest surplus, and the surplus in the overall balance of
payments contributed to a further increase in foreign exchange reserves, which
reached almost $6.8 billion at end-2006, covering about 11 months of imports. Both

2
gross public debt and public external debt continued on a downward trajectory,
declining to 40 percent and 27 percent of GDP, respectively. Nonetheless, average
core inflation accelerated to 20 percent, in part reflecting higher world food prices, as
well as domestic demand-induced pressures owing to higher government spending
out of larger than projected oil revenues. Given pressing spending needs, additional
oil revenues have been channeled essentially toward greater development
expenditures, in addition to fuel subsidies to shield vulnerable groups from higher oil
prices. With the abatement of seasonal pressures on inflation, due to a sharp drop in
prices of basic food commodities and below-budget government spending, core
inflation declined steeply to 12 percent in May 2007.
Prospects and Policies
5. The recent positive performance has not detracted the authorities' attention from the
challenges in the period ahead. While the near-term outlook is broadly manageable,
the authorities are aware of the need for tightened financial policies to bring core
inflation down within the range of 12-14 percent by end-2007. Given the heavy
weight of food components in the consumer price index, and the onset of food
stocking for the religious month of Ramadan, the current juncture of persistent
strength of world food prices would not realistically allow for an inflation rate below
10 percent in the period immediately ahead, as suggested by staff.
6. The authorities are also cognizant of the challenges posed by the prospective
depletion of proven oil reserves over the medium and longer term. The coming onstream of liquefied natural gas (LNG) production will partly mitigate the negative
drag on growth from declining oil output, and the implications for the fiscal and
external accounts will only be modest. The outlook on oil production, however, could
surprise on the upside, given the intensification of exploration and recovery efforts.
Nevertheless, the authorities are committed to maintain fiscal and external
sustainability by formulating fiscal policy within conservative estimates of proven
reserves. Sustainability considerations, however, would need to be carefully balanced
against the imperative of sustaining a minimum level of economic growth to facilitate
diversification and support labor absorption and poverty reduction. Achieving these
objectives could call for maintaining relatively high spending levels, at least over the
medium term. Policy makers are thus confronted with competing pressures on
government resources that require a delicate balancing act in the policy mix.
Fiscal Policy and Reforms
7. The 2007 budget initially envisaged an increase in the overall deficit to 6 percent of
GDP, reflecting the persistence of spending pressures against a background of a sharp
decline in oil revenues. Nonetheless, given inflationary pressures, the authorities have
effected some degree of fiscal tightening from the initial plans. In this respect,
implementation of the announced wage increase has been delayed until mid-2008 to
coincide with the introduction of biometric cards. Additionally, non-wage current
spending will be streamlined, while development spending financed by CG pledges
will help offload some capital expenditure from the budget. Together these measures

3
are expected to result in a reduction in the overall budget deficit by about 2 percent of
GDP from the initial estimates.
8. The authorities share the view that a sizable consolidation effort is needed to ensure
fiscal and debt sustainability over the medium and longer term as oil revenues taper
off. They are in broad agreement with the balance of measures proposed by staff that
emphasize increasing non-oil revenue intake and trimming government expenditures.
On the revenue side, the GST has been successfully introduced in January 2007, with
only limited exemptions, at the rate of 5 percent. The authorities remain committed to
full implementation of the GST at 10 percent by 2009 as proposed by staff. However,
they are of the view that it is important to ensure that the tax is effectively
implemented and administered before proceeding with a rate increase. Moreover, a
large tax payer unit has been established. Further efforts are contemplated to expand
the revenue base, including the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35
percent to 20 percent to harmonize it with regional levels, and the elimination of
exemptions in the income, customs, and investment laws.
9. On the expenditure side, the authorities are cognizant of the need to phase out fuel
subsidies, although progress in this area is affected by political considerations. Fuel
price increased in July 2005 had led to social unrest and considerable loss of life.
Nonetheless, the authorities are committed to link the elimination of fuel subsidies
with progress on measures to protect vulnerable groups from its adverse effects. In
this vein, a revised social assistance law will be submitted to parliament before end2007, as part of ongoing efforts to strengthen the targeting and coverage of the Social
Welfare Fund, and to broaden the subsidy reduction and render it more politically
acceptable.
10. Importantly, the authorities have taken decisive measures to address weaknesses in
budget formulation and execution by embarking on a comprehensive two-year public
financial management reform program, with the assistance of a group of donors. In
this respect, a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework will be introduced, starting
with the 2008 budget. Moreover, discussions are ongoing with a FAD technical
assistance mission regarding the establishment of a single treasury account at the
Ministry of Finance, which should further enhance control over spending.
11. The authorities appreciate the staff's debt sustainability analysis (DSA), which
incorporates the updated information on LNG revenues and export receipts, and
accounts for new disbursements pledged during the 2006 CG meeting. The DSA
underscores the fragility of debt dynamics in Yemen. Even under the assumption of
full implementation of the adjustment scenario proposed by staff, highly concessional
financing would still be required to avert debt distress over the projection period. In
this connection, and while pledges from the GCC countries, accounting for half of
total pledges at the CG, are predominantly in grant form, the authorities are hopeful
that disbursement of remaining pledges would be mindful of the need for a high
degree of concessionality.

Monetary and Financial Sector Policies
12. The Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) remains committed to the maintenance of price
stability. However, the attempts at effecting a steady depreciation of the Yemeni rial,
consistent with the gradual depletion of oil reserves, have resulted in an
accommodative monetary stance in 2006. To help alleviate emerging inflationary
pressures in 2007, the authorities have agreed to tighten monetary policy. In this
respect, and consistent with staff's advice, they have slowed the rate of depreciation
of the rial and even allowed for a modest appreciation. Nevertheless, the authorities
are mindful that reserve accumulation and competitiveness considerations would
prevail once inflationary pressures subside, with the exchange rate resuming a
market-determined path.
13. The CBY is aware of the limitations of the present monetary framework that aims at
controlling inflation through the targeting of monetary aggregates. Given the shallow
financial intermediation and relatively high deposit dollarization, there is limited
scope for a more active interest rate policy as an effective instrument to control
inflation. The authorities recognize that deepening financial intermediation and
removing structural impediments to private sector credit growth are essential to
promote non-oil sector activities. To help identify vulnerabilities and develop an
agenda for reforms, they have expressed interest in a Financial Sector Stability
Update. In addition, a revised Anti Money Laundering law, prepared partly under the
assistance of the Fund, is to be submitted to parliament for approval.
Other Structural Reforms
14. With oil production on a declining trend, the Yemeni government has stepped up
efforts to diversify the economy and promote alternative sources of growth and
employment generation. While the gas sector is of major strategic importance for
Yemen, there is concurrent focus on strategies to promote the development of the
country's tourism and maritime activities, to capitalize on the coastal location and
cultural heritage. The authorities are aware that significant levels of investment are
required for the effective development of these sectors. To this end, a number of
initiatives have been undertaken to strengthen the investment climate. In particular,
tax and administration reforms which resulted in the elimination of production taxes
on businesses have earned Yemen the title of top reformer in 2005/06 according to
the 2007 Doing Business Report. Moreover, and to further strengthen transparency in
the oil sector, the authorities intend to join the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative. Efforts will also be directed at strengthening the economy's regional
linkages, particularly with the GCC countries, and global integration, through
ongoing discussions on accession to the World Trade Organization.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Yemen
On September 17, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Yemen.1
Background
Despite recent progress in poverty reduction, Yemen remains one of the poorest countries in
the region and is far from achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Oil production has
been declining since 2000, and in the absence of major discoveries, proven oil reserves could
be depleted in some 10 years time. The start of a large liquefied natural gas project from 2009
will offer only partial compensation. Yemen faces considerable challenges to generate strong
(nonhydrocarbon) growth to absorb the rapidly growing labor force and raise living standards,
while ensuring fiscal and external stability in the context of declining oil reserves.
Economic performance in 2006 was generally favorable, but was accompanied by an increase
in inflation. Overall real GDP growth reached 4 percent in 2006, with a 6 percent non-oil growth
offsetting an 8 percent decline in oil production. After a decade of relatively stable rates in the
10–12 percent range, core inflation (excluding the volatile prices of the narcotic qat) increased
to over 20 percent. This was partly due to higher world food prices, but buoyant domestic
demand driven by increased government spending and rapid money growth, played a major
role.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
High oil prices helped reduce the overall budget deficit to about ½ percent of GDP in 2006, but
spending remained high. As in previous years, a large supplementary budget was issued at the
end of the year to validate spending overruns that had already taken place. Fuel subsidies
continued to absorb a large part of the budget (8 percent of GDP) and the wage bill rose to over
9 percent of GDP, while the non-oil tax ratio fell further to less than 7 percent of GDP. Without
corrective actions, the overall deficit would significantly widen in 2007 (to 5–7 percent of GDP)
as the approved budget maintains high spending levels despite lower oil revenues due to
declining production and prices.
Monetary policy was accommodative in 2006. With sizable government spending out of high oil
revenues, the real exchange rate appreciated by 10 percent in 2006. The Central Bank of
Yemen (CBY) continued its policy of targeting a slow and steady depreciation of the exchange
rate, so the real appreciation manifested itself through higher inflation. Money growth
accelerated to 28 percent in 2006, twice the rate of the previous two years.
The external account surplus remained broadly unchanged at over 3 percent of GDP in 2006,
with record-high oil receipts partially offset by imports related to sizable investments in the gas
sector. With the latter financed trough foreign direct investment, the high oil revenues resulted in
a large reserve accumulation by the CBY. Gross reserves at the CBY increased by $1.5 billion
to $6.8 billion by year end, the equivalent of about 11 months of imports.
Relations with the international community have strengthened. A Consultative Group meeting
held in November 2006 in London succeeded in generating almost $5 billion in pledges (about
one-fourth of 2006 GDP), underwriting a large part of Yemen’s Public Investment Program
for 2007–10. Half of the pledges came from Gulf Cooperation Council countries. Also, Yemen
was reinstated in the U.S.’s Millennium Challenge Corporation’s threshold program. The
Yemeni authorities recently committed to join the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.
Executive Board Assessment
The Executive Board welcomed Yemen’s generally favorable recent economic
performance, including the decline in the poverty rate, as well as the progress being made on a
number of structural reforms. Nevertheless, Directors concurred that the authorities face
considerable macroeconomic and structural policy challenges to promote strong economic
growth, create ample employment opportunities, and reduce poverty, while ensuring fiscal and
external sustainability. In this regard, Directors welcomed the authorities’ strategy of basing
policies on existing hydrocarbon reserves, while recognizing that the country’s economic
outlook could be significantly altered by the discovery of new oil and gas resources.
Directors, noting that inflationary pressures have not fully abated, were encouraged by
the authorities’ commitment to reducing inflation. They agreed that monetary policy should focus
closely on price stability and welcomed the CBY recent efforts to keep the exchange rate of the
rial vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar broadly stable, which should help limit imported inflation. Given the
limitations of monetary policy in Yemen, Directors generally considered it to be appropriate for
the CBY to continue to rely substantially on the exchange rate as a nominal anchor, in order to

3
achieve lower inflation. While the exchange rate currently appears to be broadly in line with
fundamentals, over time and in view of the expected decline in oil production, it will be important
for the exchange rate to reflect evolving economic conditions.
Directors observed that the shallow financial intermediation, along with a relatively high
level of dollarization, is limiting the effectiveness of monetary policy. They viewed that the
removal of the minimum interest rate for rial deposits would allow the CBY to conduct a more
active interest rate policy and enhance financial intermediation.
Directors noted that fiscal restraint, including public sector wage restraint, should provide
an important complement to monetary policy in reducing inflationary pressures. They also
underscored that frontloading fiscal adjustment will be needed, given the prospective decline in
oil production and revenues.
Directors agreed that the gradual phasing out of domestic fuel subsidies will be central to
fiscal adjustment, while recognizing that this will require political support. They noted that raising
fuel prices should go hand-in-hand with strengthening the social safety net, in order to cushion
the impact on the poor, including through persevering with ongoing efforts aimed at improving
the Social Welfare Fund. Directors also were of the view that, if the authorities wished to
cushion the impact of high wheat prices on the poor, it would be preferable to do so through the
SWF. Strong efforts will also be needed to increase the government’s non-oil revenues, reorient
spending towards priority areas, and improve the quality and effectiveness of capital spending.
Directors supported the progress being made towards strengthening the budgetary framework
and improving fiscal transparency.
Directors underscored the importance of productivity-enhancing reforms to strengthen
Yemen’s competitiveness in non-oil exports. Further efforts are needed to improve the
investment climate and the quality of labor, enhance governance and reduce red tape, including
in tax and customs administration. Directors stressed that deepening financial markets will be
essential for ensuring strong non-oil performance, and also recommended further strengthening
of banking supervision. In this regard, they encouraged the authorities to request an Financial
Sector Assessment Program update, which would help to assess potential risks in the financial
system and to develop an agenda for financial sector reforms. Directors welcomed the revised
Anti-Money Laundering law, and looked forward to its approval by parliament.
Directors looked forward to further efforts to improve the quality and timeliness of
macroeconomic statistics, to better facilitate the formulation and monitoring of economic
policies.
