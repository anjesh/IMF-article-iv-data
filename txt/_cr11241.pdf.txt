Executive Summary
Background and outlook: Growth recovered on the strength of international oil prices,
strong rebound in agricultural sector and rapid credit expansion. Inflation was contained
while fiscal and external positions improved. The launch of the subsidy reform in December
2010 has increased inflation temporarily and is expected to result in a temporary slowdown
of economic growth. While high oil prices and efficiency gains resulting from the subsidy
reform should support rapid economic recovery, an accommodative policy stance could lead
to high inflation and derail reform efforts.
Policies priorities: Key priorities are to (i) maintain short term macroeconomic stability to
support the reform process; (ii) transition further to a market-based economy to foster growth
and support job creation; and, (iii) strengthen the financial sector.
Staff Recommendations:


Coordinated and tight credit and fiscal policies are essential to maintain
macroeconomic stability in the aftermath of the subsidy reform.



The authorities should continue to flexibly manage the exchange rate, and maintain
a unified exchange rate.



Achieving higher growth and creating new jobs will require restructuring the
corporate sector, supporting the creation of new enterprises, removing labor market
frictions, encouraging foreign investment, and accelerating the ongoing privatization
process.



Addressing the banking sector’s large NPLs portfolio, and strengthening capital
adequacy and profitability are essential to allow the banking sector to support growth.

Authorities’ Views:


Steadfast implementation of the subsidy reform will continue, while preserving
macroeconomic stability in the transition period, including through limiting central
bank credit to banks and possible increasing interest rates.



Corporate restructuring might require more subsidized loans and financing.



Recapitalizing public banks, further reducing NPLs, enhancing central bank
supervision, and introducing a deposit guarantee fund are important elements of the
banking reform strategy.

I. OVERVIEW
1.
Iran is benefitting from the rebound in international oil prices. With the breakeven price for the budget and current account in 2010/11 at $75 per barrel and $60 per barrel
respectively, the increase in oil price to $80 per barrel on average, has helped improve the
current account and budget surplus, and maintain comfortable international reserves.
2.
The sharp increase in the domestic prices of energy products on December 19,
2010 is estimated to have reduced the cost of subsidies by about 15 percent of GDP
(US$60 billion).1 Equal cash transfers to 70 million people were made ahead of the price
increase. The early stage of implementation of the reform was largely positive (Box 1).
Box 1. Initial Impact of the Targeted Subsidy Reform1/
The subsidy reform law stipulates that out of the revenue arising from the price increase, about US$30 billion is to be
redistributed in the first year to households in freely usable cash, $15-18 billion to enterprises to finance their
restructuring to reduce energy intensity, and around $10-12 billion to the government to allow it to pay for higher
energy bills and improve energy efficiency in the public sector.
The distribution of cash transfers to households is estimated to have reduced poverty incidence from 12 to 2 percent,
on the basis of a $2 per day poverty line. Moreover, regional disparities in poverty have sharply declined. The
distribution of cash transfers markedly improved income distribution. As a result, the Gini coefficient is estimated to
have fallen from 0.40–0.45 before the reform to 0.37 after the implementation of the subsidy reform.
Energy consumption reportedly declined by up to 20 percent for some fuels. The impact on the environment is
estimated to be positive. Preliminary estimates show a reduction in most emissions from fossil fuels.

Subsidy Reform,” IMF Working Paper (forthcoming).

3.
New international sanctions in 2010 have in practice increased the cost of doing
business, limited FDI and technology transfer, and have affected international trade
and financial transactions. The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) sanctions include
a ban on financing and exports related to Iran’s nuclear and military programs. Additional

1

Most energy prices were raised to about half of their international price level at the time of the reform. Prices
of fuel oil, kerosene, and diesel were raised from about 1 to 1.6 cents per liter to 10 to 35 cents a liter. Gasoline
prices went up from 10/15 cents per liter (regular/premium) to 70/80 cents per liter for un-rationed quantities
(40/55 cents for up to 60 liters per car per month). Multi-tier, escalating electricity (natural gas) tariffs rose from
an average of about 1.5 cents per KWh (cubic meter) to 5–7 cents per unit. Wheat prices were raised more than
40 times and bread prices were allowed to increase gradually.

5
sanctions beyond those called for by the UNSC pose constraints on some international
financial transactions, particularly in the Euro and the U.S. dollar. The authorities have
expressed concern over these sanctions and those imposed by the UNSC and their effect on
Iran’s ability to participate, in particular, in payments and settlements under the international
monetary system.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. Recent Economic Developments
4.
Economic growth accelerated from the cyclical downturn in 2008/09 (Figure 1).
A severe drought and cuts in oil production slowed growth to 0.6 percent in 2008/09.
However, a sharp rebound in agriculture production supported modest economic recovery in
2009/10 and further expansion in 2010/11. The distribution of cash transfers to households is
estimated to have partly offset the negative impact of the energy price increases on domestic
demand, resulting in a moderate decline of real GDP growth from 3.5 percent in 2009/10 to
3.2 percent 2010/11. On the strength of high oil prices, the current account surplus improved
to 6 percent of GDP in 2010/11.
5.
Building upon their success in reducing inflation over the last few years, the
authorities were able to contain inflation in the aftermath of the subsidy reform
(Figure 2). The authorities’ monetary policy implementation brought down annual average
inflation from 25.4 percent in 2008/09 to 12.4 percent in 2010/11. Despite the very large
domestic energy price increases in December, inflation remained relatively contained.
Numerous administrative measures, such as price monitoring and enforcement of price
transparency and the accumulation of inventories of strategic foodstuffs, helped slow down
the pass-through of higher energy prices into other prices. While there was an almost
doubling of the central bank’s claims on banks (related mainly to the financing of subsidized
housing), the central bank sterilized this increase by selling foreign exchange. As a result,
consumer price inflation only increased from 10.1 percent in December to 14.2 percent at
end-May 2011, with the average monthly inflation rate for January–May reaching only
2¼ percent.
6.
The fiscal surplus improved in 2010/11 to 1.7 percent of GDP, reflecting prudent
spending policies. In particular, the authorities reduced capital spending, and saved some
of the extra revenue from increased oil prices in the newly established National Development
Fund (NDF) (Figure 3).2

2

Borrowing from the NDF by the government is not allowed. The Oil Stabilization Fund (OSF) will continue to
exist as a separate government account.

7.
To address a widening spread between the interbank and parallel exchange
rates, the central bank allowed the rial to depreciate by 11.5 percent on June 8
(Figure 2). While overall money growth remained moderate, the increase in central bank
credit to banks led to the emergence of a spread between the interbank rate and the “parallel”
rate offered at exchange bureaus, as well as to a rapid increase in gold coin prices (Figure 2).
The increase in the use of exchange bureaus also reflected the impact of sanctions on the
conduct of international financial transactions through the banking system.3
8.
The financial sector has undergone major transformations in the last two years.
Four public banks were privatized and listed on the Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE), making
private banks the largest segment in the market. About 1,700 credit cooperatives were
brought under the central bank’s supervision. Nonperforming loans (NPLs) stood at
13.5 percent of total loan portfolio at the end of March 2011 down from 24.5 percent in
January 2010, reflecting intensified loan collection efforts. At the same time, capital
adequacy ratios declined from 9.6 percent in March 2010 to 8.4 percent at the end of March
2011, reflecting increasing capitalization needs of public banks. While the surge of equity
prices since 2009 has been large, staff analysis suggests that stock prices have not yet
reached bubble levels, with supportive fundamental factors, including high levels of IPOs,
having been at play (Box 2).
Figure 3. Distribution of Oil Revenue for 2011/12

The authorities have reported that they are actively monitoring transactions at the exchange bureaus and are
cracking down on the bureaus that conduct transactions at exchange rates that differ from the interbank market
exchange rate. Staff will continue to monitor this issue, and does not see this time elements pointing to the
existence of a multiple currency practice in connection with the spread between the interbank rate and the
parallel rate at the exchange bureaus.

9
Box 2. Is there a Price Bubble in the Tehran Stock Exchange?
By April 2011, the Tehran Stock Exchange
(TSE) all-share index (TEPIX) had increased
200 percent from its early 2009 low, raising
concerns about a bubble. Russia and Turkey had
comparable increases in the region. The TEPIX
growth was broad-based across sectors. It
coincided with a surge in IPOs related to Iran’s
privatization program, which allows for
80 percent of state assets to be sold: 40 percent
via the distribution of shares to low-income
households; 40 percent via IPOs. The increase in
free float has encouraged trading and developed a
shareholding culture, an explicit objective of the
government. The decline in real estate prices and
the low real deposit rates have also contributed to
increasing the attractiveness of equities as an investment.

Although the price surge between early 2009 and April 2011 has been the largest in any 2-year window over
the past ten years, the TSE is not an outlier. China, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia have had price surges up to twice as
large as Iran during that period of time. Moreover, Iran’s episodes of stock market corrections since 2001 have been
the smallest among the comparator countries considered here.

There is also no evidence of a bubble from looking at valuations. Compared with other markets where
price/earnings ratios (P/Es) have been in excess of 10, TSE P/Es remain low at around 6, partly reflecting Iran’s
frontier market status and international sanctions.

B. Medium-Term Outlook
9.
With prudent macroeconomic policies, the medium-term outlook is positive.
On the strength of high oil prices and expected efficiency gains resulting from the domestic
subsidy reform, growth is expected to rebound to about 4.5 percent in the medium term
(Text Table 1). Moreover, compensatory payments to households and limited import
substitution because of sanctions and higher tariffs on consumption goods, should help
mitigate the immediate negative impact of the subsidy reform on growth. Average inflation
is expected to rise to about 23 percent in 2011/12 because of the step increases in the price
level, but should come down to 12 percent in 2012/13 if the authorities maintain tight
macroeconomic policies. The current account surplus is projected to rise in line with the
increase in oil prices to reach about 9 percent of GDP in 2011/12.

10.
The medium-term outlook is subject to considerable risks. The main risk is an
acceleration of inflation if macroeconomic policies are too accommodative. An increase, at
least temporarily, in unemployment during the restructuring of the corporate sector could
also pose social tensions and lead to a loosening of macroeconomic policies. Progress with
the reform could also slow down as a result of reform fatigue. In addition, the authorities

11
stated that the sanctions impede Iran’s trade transactions, and that if this continues they might
halt their oil exports, with major global spillovers.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Against this background, the authorities’ main challenges are to (i) maintain short term
macroeconomic stability to support the reform process; (ii) transition further to a free
market-based economy to foster growth and support job creation; and, (iii) strengthen
the financial sector.
A. Preserving Macroeconomic Stability in the Near Term
11.
The authorities concurred that maintaining macroeconomic stability is critical
to the success of the reform. While the continuation of central bank credit to banks,
including for housing, low lending and deposit rates, and additional fiscal spending out
of extra oil revenues could support higher growth, this would likely rapidly result in higher
inflation, a sizeable foreign exchange premium, capital outflows, and a weakening of the
international reserve position. In turn, rampant inflation would result in a rapid erosion
of domestic energy prices and of the targeted subsidies in real terms, and reduce incentives
for enterprises to restructure, effectively reversing the early gains of the subsidy reform. By
contrast, maintaining price stability would help prevent an upward, and potentially rapidly
self-fulfilling, adjustment of inflation expectations, as shown by the experience of transition
economies that have implemented in similar reforms.
12.
The recent depreciation of the nominal exchange rate to a level close to the
parallel market rate reflects the central bank’s objective to keep a unified exchange
rate. The new level of the nominal exchange rate is broadly in line with the projected
inflation differential vis-à-vis Iran’s main trading partner countries, and the development
of fundamentals over the medium term. The central bank also reiterated its intention to reach
a consensus in the Monetary and Credit Council (MCC) to increase nominal rates of return
to ensure positive real rates, and discourage alternative investments such as foreign currency
and gold.
13.
The authorities concurred on the need for tight credit and fiscal policies to
contain inflation and avoid a sizeable foreign exchange market premium. They agreed
that central bank credit to banks should be restrained. In addition, staff emphasized that any
potential oil revenue windfall from higher oil prices should be saved by the government, and
any additional foreign exchange inflows sterilized. Staff noted that while the recent rial
depreciation to the parallel exchange rate will benefit exporters and increase competitiveness
of domestic producers, reductions in import tariffs for capital and intermediate goods would
help reduce the inflationary impact of the depreciation.
14.
Going forward, the authorities should further liberalize prices to build on the
efficiency gains of the subsidy reform. Enterprises need to adapt to new demand and cost

12
patterns by changing their production mix and technologies. The authorities should gradually
relax any remaining supervision and interventions over product prices, and rely on the
compensatory cash transfers and possible additional targeted social assistance to support
overall demand and safeguard the most vulnerable groups.
B. Ensuring the Transition to a Market-Based Economy to Foster Growth
and Employment
15.
The authorities view the transformation to a market-based economy as a means
to enhance efficiency and increase the growth potential (Figures 4–5). Iran has a relatively
well-diversified economy with a sizeable industrial base, but large scale subsidies and
inefficiencies have limited Iran’s ability to further develop its non-oil economy. Iran’s total
factor productivity growth has been low, and its energy-intensiveness increased in recent
years. Despite some recent improvements, Iran only ranked 129 out of 183 in the ease of
doing business in 2010. FDI flows have also remained very low by comparison to a group
of comparator countries,4 largely due to international sanctions but also on account of
a difficult business environment.
16.
The authorities also view job creation as a key challenge (Figure 5).
Unemployment remains high at about 14.5 percent in 2010, and is particularly prevalent
among the youth (at about
20%
Projected Unemployment Rate Under Different
25 percent). There is also an

17.
To achieve higher growth and create jobs, the authorities have adopted a
comprehensive multi-pronged strategy as reflected in their 20-year Vision document
and 5th Five-Year Development Plan (FYDP). The strategy aims at promoting a marketbased economy by reducing the role of the government, privatizing enterprises, and
increasingly allowing prices to reflect market forces. To support the phasing out of subsidies,
enterprises that are most energy-intensive can qualify for subsidized loans to invest in
energy-efficient technologies. In addition, the government has set up incentive programs
to improve management and productivity.
18.
Staff presented the experience of transition economies to underscore the
importance of creating new enterprises to facilitate a structural change. The recently
launched programs to promote entrepreneurship, including private-run consultancy and
training programs, are important steps in facilitating the creation and development of
enterprises. The success of these initiatives should be assessed by monitoring the number
of newly created enterprises and jobs. Further efforts should also be made to continue
streamlining licensing procedures, particularly for small services.
19.
Adequate unemployment benefits and re-training opportunities are needed
to smooth the transition between jobs and to foster corporate restructuring. The existing
unemployment benefit system (of up to 50 months) is too generous and should be set at
levels that encourage workers to undergo re-training and find new employment. The planned
database to match skills of job seekers and potential employers would contribute to removing
frictions in the labor market. The administrative approval process to allow companies to
terminate redundant workers could also be simplified.
20.
To preserve macroeconomic stability and incentives for effective corporate
restructuring, subsidized financial support should not be provided to nonviable
enterprises. Financing for enterprise restructuring should be carried out “at arms’ length,”
and conditional on credible restructuring plans with strong safeguards to minimize the
potential impact of enterprise lobbying. The authorities should also monitor closely potential
inter-enterprise arrears, trends in inventories, and the accumulation of NPLs in the banking
sector for signs of financial stress. While noting staff’s recommendations, the authorities
believed that more financing and government intervention might be needed for enterprise
restructuring.
21.
Encouraging foreign investment and accelerating the ongoing privatization
process will also support the restructuring of the economy. Greater participation
of foreign investors would not only bring capital but also the much-needed modern
technologies, management know-how, and access to foreign markets. The planned
privatization of SMEs with listing on Iran’s stock exchange would give these companies
access to new capital, increase work incentives, and reduce pressures for bailouts and quasifiscal activities.

16
22.
Staff noted that further enhancing transparency and data collection on economic
activity is essential to facilitate policy-making. National income statistics should be
published with minimum delays. High-frequency data across various sectors should be
collected and analyzed. The presentation of fiscal accounts on the basis of GFSM2001
manual would be an important step in increasing transparency on fiscal operations
(Appendix II), and should be further improved by giving a more detailed presentation
of transactions of financial assets and liabilities.
23.
Completing the removal of subsidies and implementing the ongoing tax and
customs reform are essential to reduce Iran’s dependency on oil and natural gas. The
authorities noted that the 5th FYPD envisages a complete elimination of subsidies within five
years, with domestic prices of energy and other commodities to be automatically adjusted in
line with commodity prices on the Iran Mercantile Exchange. The authorities also noted that
several measures should contribute to increasing non-oil revenues, including an increase of
the VAT rate by one percentage point per year over the next five years, the implementation
of a risk-based audit software to enhance compliance, and the introduction of a zero rate for
all tax exemptions. In the area of external trade, customs tariffs and taxes should be lowered
and streamlined in the medium term, and the number of importers exempt from customs
should be reduced to a minimum.
C. Strengthening the Financial Sector to Sustain Economic Development
24.
The banking system’s aggregate buffers are low. The intrinsic volatility of Iran’s
economy calls for a higher minimum capital adequacy and a higher provision cover. This
would require limiting dividend distribution of
Credit Growth and Capital Adequacy Ratios in Selected Emerging
Markets
undercapitalized banks, and strengthening banks’
profitability by giving banks more flexibility in
setting interest rates and reducing operating costs.

25.
The recent decline in NPLs as a result of
improved collection and the establishment of
credit registry are important steps to improve
credit allocation. Further steps to address the
large NPL portfolio should include an accurate
mapping of NPLs. The establishment of an asset
management company would help banks focus on
normal banking activity, rather than loan
recovery. Removing controls on credit allocation
and interest rates will also be important to ensure
proper incentives for more responsible risktakings by banks.

26.
Banking practices and standards of information disclosure and corporate
governance have been improving. The public listing of privatized banks has resulted in the
quarterly disclosure of financial information to the Securities and Exchange Organization for
half of the banking system. Furthermore, the central bank issued a regulation on loan
classification and provisioning in 2007 that made core financial soundness more comparable
across banks, thus helping to reveal the extent of forbearance needed for banking to function
effectively in relative isolation.
27.
The 5th FYDP has increased the central bank’s supervision powers. The central
bank has been given authority to disqualify directors and senior officers of banks, and extend
its fit and proper tests to public bank officers. The 5th FYDP authorizes the government to
allow public banks to retain after-tax profits into capital, instead of accruing them to the
budget. The central bank is also revamping its regulatory framework to align it with
international best practices, by increasing fines for non-compliance with regulations,
introducing regulation on related party lending and large exposures, and mandatory
disclosure of core financial soundness indicators. However, staff advised that it was critical
that the central bank be given full autonomy to exercise its prompt enforcement powers
(“cease-and-desist”), which are currently limited.

28.
The launching of a centralized, real-time database with positive credit data in
2011 is a first step toward establishing a comprehensive early warning system. The early
warning system should strive to anticipate vulnerabilities, based on the international
experience, and monitor risk-taking in a detailed manner especially of bank exposures to
concentration of risks. High dependence on funding from large depositors and connectedness
also requires close monitoring.

18
29.
There is a need to develop a comprehensive contingency preparedness
framework. In addition to the planned deposit guarantee fund, this framework should also
include a special insolvency regime that ensures swift central bank intervention in troubled
banks. The crisis management framework also needs a clear lender of last resort policy,
supported by minimum liquidity buffers that allow banks to withstand protracted periods
of stress in funding markets without central bank support.
30.
The Securities and Exchange Organization should ensure a robust investor
protection framework, particularly for retail investors that use equities as a savings
vehicle. To this end, it would be useful to intensify market surveillance of large trades and
unusual price movements, and verify that retail accounts held by intermediaries are well
segregated.
31.
There has been progress towards establishing a comprehensive AML/CFT
framework. A draft law on combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) has been sent to
Parliament and a Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) has been established. However, a number
of shortcomings remain, in particular as regards the current draft CFT Law and the operation
of the FIU. In addition, Iran has not yet ratified and implemented the 1999 International
Convention on the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
The Iranian economy has rebounded from the downturn in 2008/09, but
inflation remains high. The recovery of oil prices, a strong performance of the agricultural
sector, and rapid credit expansion supported growth. Although high, inflation was contained,
while external position improved in 2010/11.
33.
The successful early implementation of the subsidy reform is a critical step in
promoting the transition towards a market-based economy. The sharp increase in the
price of energy and agricultural products in December 2010 is estimated to have removed
close to 15 percent of GDP in annual product subsidies. The price increase has already
resulted in a drop in energy consumption and a reduction in pollution. The distribution of
cash transfers to almost all households was instrumental in securing support for the reform,
improving income distribution, reducing poverty, and supporting domestic demand.
34.
The medium term growth outlook is positive, but subject to considerable
downside risks. Although the reform may result in a temporary slowdown in growth, the
combination of prudent macroeconomic policies, high oil prices, and expected efficiency
gains resulting from the subsidy reform are expected to support a higher growth potential in
the medium term while maintaining relative price stability. Accommodative macroeconomic
policies could boost growth in the short-run, but would likely lead to much higher inflation,
and weaker international reserve position. The economic sanctions are also likely to weigh
on international transactions.

19
35.
The recent depreciation of the nominal exchange rate has brought it broadly
in line with fundamentals. The staff welcomes the authorities’ resolve to keep a unified
exchange rate. The authorities should continue to manage flexibly the exchange rate to
maintain a strong international reserve position.
36.
Relatively tight credit and fiscal policies are necessary to contain inflation and
avoid a sizeable foreign exchange premium. In the immediate period ahead, credit policy
should remain adequately tight by ensuring positive real rates, and restraining central bank
credit to banks. At the same time, the government should save any potential oil revenue
windfall from higher oil prices to contain domestic demand and money growth, while the
central bank should stand ready to sterilize additional foreign exchange inflows. A reduction
in import tariffs for capital and intermediate goods would help reduce the inflationary impact
of the depreciation.
37.
The authorities’ economic reform strategy, anchored in privatization, reduction
of the role of government, and market-based prices for energy and agricultural goods
should help achieve higher growth and create jobs. In particular, the ongoing restructuring
of existing enterprises through the adoption of energy-efficient technologies, and the
steadfast implementation of initiatives to support the creation of new enterprises, are critical
to move Iran to a higher growth path. The development of new growth sectors will require
rebalancing of the economy, and should be supported by labor market reforms, including
adequate unemployment benefits. Ongoing programs to enhance skill matching and retrain
workers should help remove labor market frictions. To avoid weakening incentives for
effective corporate restructuring, subsidized financial support should not be provided to
nonviable enterprises. At the same time, encouraging foreign investment and accelerating
the ongoing privatization process will also bring new financing and support the restructuring
of the economy.
38.
The full removal of subsidies and steadfast implementation of the ongoing tax
and customs reform are essential to reduce Iran’s dependency on oil and natural gas.
The subsidies should be fully eliminated over the medium term as planned under the
5th FYDP. Measures to increase the VAT rate, enhance tax compliance, and reduce tax
exemptions will increase non-oil revenues. In addition, in the area of external trade, customs
tariffs and taxes should be reduced and streamlined in the medium term.
39.
The authorities’ increasing focus on strengthening the banking sector is well
placed. In particular, the intrinsic volatility of Iran’s economy calls for higher minimum
capital adequacy and higher provision cover, and strengthening banks’ profitability by giving
banks more flexibility in setting interest rates and reducing operating costs. Further steps to
address the large NPL portfolio should include an accurate mapping of NPLs, and the
possible establishment of an asset management company. The recent decision to increase the
central bank’s supervision powers is encouraging, but it is critical that the central bank be

20
given full autonomy to exercise its enforcement powers. The development of a
comprehensive contingency preparedness framework should include a special insolvency
regime for banks in addition to the planned deposit guarantee fund. The crisis management
framework also needs a clear lender of last resort policy.
40.
The authorities should continue enhancing Iran’s AML/CFT framework in line
with international standards, with the continued cooperation of international
organizations. While the transmittal to Parliament of a draft law on combating the financing
of terrorism (CFT) is a welcome step in that direction, the draft CFT law should be amended
to incorporate the recommendations made by staff, and subsequently adopted. The authorities
should also ratify the 1999 International Convention on the Suppression of the Financing
of Terrorism.
41.
Further enhancing transparency and information on economic activity is
essential to facilitate policy-making. High frequency data, particularly on national
accounts, should be published with minimum delays.
42.
The staff recommends approval of the further retention of the multiple currency
practice (MCP) arising from budget subsidies for foreign exchange purchases in
connection with payments of certain letters of credit through July 20, 2014. This MCP
arises in connection with a scheme that has been discontinued, but where contracts have yet
to expire.5 The MCP is not maintained for balance of payments reasons; it does not materially
impede Iran’s balance of payment adjustment, and does not discriminate among, or harm the
interests of, other members. Regarding the multiple currency practice related with obligations
of certain entities to surrender unused allocations of foreign exchange to the central bank
of Iran at a subsidized rate the authorities informed that there are no reports in recent years
pertaining to such surrender obligations and that any amounts are negligible. On the basis
of the existing information, the staff proposes that at this time this multiple currency practice
be considered eliminated.
43.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with the Islamic
Republic of Iran be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

5

The authorities have reported that the aggregate outstanding amount of the letters of credit for which subsidies
have been provided is USD 707 million, with USD 672 million maturing by 2018 and USD 35 million maturing
by 2025 and that the aggregate amount compares favorably with the USD 5 billion amount that existed in
September of 2004. Staff proposes that approval be granted at this time for three year, to allow for the continual
review the measure

APPENDIX I. IRAN: EXCHANGE RATE ASSESSMENT
Preliminary estimates from CGER-type methodologies for exchange rate assessment indicate
that the Iranian Rial is broadly in line with fundamentals.1
1.
The real exchange rate has appreciated by 3 percent in 2010. The real effective
exchange rate continued its appreciating trend during the last five years. The trade-weighted
real effective exchange rate
(REER) index appreciated
by 33 percent cumulatively
between end 2007 and 2010
while the appreciation
slowed down to 3 percent in
2010. The nominal effective
exchange rate, on the other
hand, continued a
depreciating trend with a
brief hiatus in 2009.

2.
The equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) approach suggests that the rial is
broadly in line with equilibrium. The estimation suggests that while the rial was
undervalued between 2004 and 2008, it became briefly overvalued late 2008 to mid 2009 and
followed an undervalued trend since then. The misalignment of the equilibrium REER from
the actual REER (as of April 2011) is a small deviation of about 1.5 percent undervaluation.
If the nominal exchange rate remained stable, it would be slightly overvalued by the end
of the year with a projected inflation of about 22 percent.

The macroeconomic balance approach suggests that while the Iranian rial is
close to its estimated norm during 2010 and over the medium term. The macroeconomic
balance approach estimates an equilibrium current account (norm) from a set of fundamentals

APPENDIX II: MIGRATION OF IRAN FISCAL PRESENTATION INTO THE GFSM 2001
PRESENTATION
I. BACKGROUND
1.
In March 2010, the Executive Board of the IMF approved the Government Finance
Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) as the standard for presentation of the fiscal data in
Fund’s reports.1 As a result, starting May 2011, staff reports should include a fiscal
presentation based on the GFSM 2001. The proposed fiscal presentation consists of two
tables: a statement of operations, and an integrated financial balance sheet (Figure 1).

2.
In line with the Board’s decision, the fiscal presentation for Iran adopted in this
Article IV consultation report is presented on the basis of a GFSM 2001. Migrating to the
GFSM 2001 methodology required mapping the fiscal source data, discussing with the
authorities data issues related to the new classification, filling in data gaps, and integrating
the new fiscal database into the macroeconomic framework.

1

Executive Board decision No. 14565–10/20

32
II. SOURCE DATA
3.
The source data provided by the authorities cover the budget operations, transactions
of the Oil Stabilization Fund, and the National Development Fund.
4.
The main source data are two tables compiled by the central bank that provide annual
data on the budget execution: Table 16 “Central Government Fiscal Position” and Table 17
“Central Government Revenue.” The presentation in these two tables is largely based on a
budget classification compliant with the GFSM 2001 for revenue and expense. However, the
breakdown of the nonfinancial assets and the financing data is not fully in line with the
GFSM 2001: (i) oil revenue is classified as disposal of nonfinancial assets, as opposed to
revenue in GFSM 2001; and (ii) the financing data is divided into two categories, (a) the
disposal of financial assets which consists of the disposal of financial assets and the
incurrence of liabilities, and (b) the acquisition of financial assets which consists of the
acquisition of financial assets and a decrease of liabilities. Additional information related to
the transactions of OSF and NDF were also mapped and included in the fiscal presentation.
III. MAPPING THE FISCAL DATA INTO THE GFSM 2001 PRESENTATION
5.
Regarding the statement of operations, the work consisted of bridging the source data
and classifying each transaction into the correspondent classification in GFSM 2001. In order
to insure the proper bridging of these data, the mission met with officials from the Central
Bank and the Ministry of Finance to get clarifications on the treatment of some transactions
and discussed the appropriate classification in the GFSM 2001 presentation. As for the
financial balance, the data currently presented only covers part of the stock of financial assets
and liabilities of the government, which was derived from the monetary survey.
6.
As a result of the mapping (Table 1), the fiscal presentation of Iran is currently
presented based on the format of the GFSM 2001. Moving forward, improvements are
needed mainly for the transactions of financial assets and liabilities and the financial balance
sheet. Additional data provided by the authorities on financing flows and stocks would help
achieve a more detailed fiscal presentation.

consists of lending to private corporations. However, the repayment of these loans is very minimal.

Exchange System

The exchange rate is determined in the interbank foreign exchange market. The Islamic
Republic of Iran maintains a de jure managed floating arrangement against a basket of
currencies. The rial gradually depreciated against a composite of currencies that included
the Euro, the U.S. dollar, and the Japanese yen. Effective January 4, 2008, the classification
of the de facto exchange rate arrangement was changed from a conventional pegged
arrangement to a crawling peg, and later in 2008, in view of further increase in exchange rate
flexibility, the arrangement was reclassified to other managed arrangement. With effect from
September 6, 2004, the Islamic Republic of Iran accepted the obligations under Article VIII,

3
Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. Iran maintains one exchange
restriction and a multiple currency practice subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII,
Sections 2(a) and 3.
a.
The exchange restriction arises from limitations on the transferability of rial profits
from certain investments under the Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Act and
from limitations on other investment-related current international payments under this act.
b.
The multiple currency practice arises from the budget subsidies for foreign
exchange purchases in connection with payments of certain letters of credit opened prior to
March 21, 2002 under the previous multiple exchange rate system.

The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on Feb 3, 2010.

APPENDIX III. ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision to the Fund is generally adequate for effective surveillance; however, the data
are reported with significant delays. The Central Bank of Iran (CBI) disseminates key
statistical aggregates in its quarterly Economic Trends, also available at
<http://www.cbi.ir/e/>. Since 2002, the Fund’s Statistics Department has assisted the
authorities in their efforts to subscribe to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS).
The progress, however, has been slow and gaps in meeting SDDS requirements for data
coverage, periodicity, and timeliness remain.
Real sector statistics


National accounts statistics are reasonably sound but should be released in a timely
manner. Improvements have been made in the coverage of the informal economy.
However, there is scope for further progress, especially in the coverage of small-scale
industries and services. Also, the CBI and the Statistical Center of Iran (SCI) have
undertaken to review and unify their respective GDP estimates.



Price statistics are sound and released in a timely manner. The official labor market
statistics are released by the SCI, and are based on the definitions recommended by
the International Labor Organization (ILO). The data are based on an urban and rural
population sample of about 100,000 households, and the threshold for considering a
person employed is two days a week. Labor market statistics, however, could benefit
from further improvement, particularly with regard to employment and wage data.

Government finance statistics


The data are compiled in accordance with the Government Finance Statistics Manual
2001 (GFSM2001) for the budgetary central government operations in addition to the
Oil Stabilization Fund and the National Development Fund. The data consist of a
statement of operations and an integrated financial balance sheet.



Data on central government operations cover the general budget, the special purpose
funds, and certain transactions with the Social Security Organization. These data are
not consolidated. There is a need to expand the coverage of central government to
include the complete transactions of the Social Security Organization, four pension
funds, and five procurement and distribution centers.



Since 2006, the data reported in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook cover
the general government sector.



The existing cash-based government accounting system should be upgraded toward
an accrual accounting system or a modified cash accounting where noncash
operations (such as advances and arrears) are identified.



Financing data in the GFS are broken down by residency of debt holders and by type
of debt instruments according to GFSM 2001. However, there is a need to develop a

6
comprehensive database on domestic and external public debt and to align the
coverage of the monetary data with the coverage of the fiscal data.

The target subsidy organization is considered as a public corporation and is classified
in the nonfinancial public corporations sector.

Monetary statistics


Monthly monetary data are reported to STA for publication in IFS, but periodicity has
been lagging.



Compilation of monetary statistics diverges from international standards in the
application of the residency criterion and in sectorization and classification of
accounts. The authorities are undertaking improvements in each of these areas, in line
with the recommendations of STA missions.



The measure of broad money employed by the CBI does not include deposits of
public nonfinancial corporations, local governments, or foreign-currency deposits

External sector data


The accounting system for foreign exchange receipts and payments of the CBI and
banks is being implemented in line with the methodological guidelines of the Fund’s
Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5). This will allow compilation of
balance of payments statistics on a quarterly basis. Annual balance of payments data
up to 2000 have been reported to STA for publication in BOPSY and IFS.



Data on the international investment position are compiled, but not disseminated.
Only data on public and publicly guaranteed debt are disseminated, but classifications
do not fully accord with the guidelines of the External Debt Guide. The data template
on international reserves and foreign currency liquidity is not compiled.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
the Islamic Republic of Iran
On July 20, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Islamic Republic of Iran.1
Background
Iran has started implementing a major subsidy reform by raising sharply the prices of
energy and agricultural products in December 2010, removing close to US$60 billion
dollars (about 15 percent of GDP) in annual product subsidies. The subsidy reform is
expected to increase efficiency and competitiveness of the economy, improve income
distribution, reduce poverty, and help Iran unlock its full growth potential.
Economic growth rebounded from the cyclical downturn in 2008/09 to reach 3.2 percent
for the 2010/11, spurred by a recovery in agriculture production, and higher oil prices.
Building upon their success in reducing inflation from 25.4 percent in 2008/09 to
12.4 percent in 2010/11, the Central Bank of Iran was able to contain inflation in the
aftermath of the subsidy reform. As a result, consumer price inflation has only increased
from 10.1 percent in December to 14.2 percent at end-May 2011.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
Other key macroeconomic indicators continued to improve in 2010/11. The overall fiscal
surplus is estimated at 1.7 percent of GDP in 2010/11, reflecting prudent spending
policies. The current account surplus increased to 6 percent of GDP in 2010/11, in line
with the recovery of oil prices.
While overall money growth had remained moderate, an increase in central bank credit
to banks, mainly related to the financing of subsidized housing, led to the emergence
of a wide spread between the interbank rate and the parallel rate, as well as a rapid
increase in gold coin prices.
On the backdrop of high oil prices and expected efficiency gains resulting from the
domestic subsidy reform, the outlook is positive with growth expected to rebound in the
medium-term. Average inflation is expected to rise in 2011/12 because of a step
increase in prices, but should come down in 2012/13 if the authorities implement
sufficiently tight credit and fiscal policies. The fiscal balance and the current account
surplus are projected to improve in line with the rise in oil prices in 2011/12.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors welcomed the economic recovery, the decline in inflation, and the
improvement in the external and fiscal positions in 2010/11. Directors noted that the
medium-term outlook remains positive on the strength of high oil prices and potential
efficiency gains related to the recent subsidy reform. They stressed, however, that
continued prudent policies are essential to maintain macroeconomic stability and lay the
basis for sustained growth.
Directors welcomed the early success in the implementation of the subsidy reform,
which is a critical step in enhancing energy efficiency, supporting growth, and moving
further towards a market-based economy. Directors noted that cash transfers, financed
out of the revenues arising from the energy price increases, were instrumental in
supporting domestic demand, improving income distribution, and reducing poverty.
Directors stressed that tight fiscal and monetary policies are necessary to contain
inflation and allow a smooth adjustment of relative prices following the subsidy reform.
In particular, they encouraged the authorities to save any oil revenue windfall and
sterilize the related foreign exchange inflows. They also emphasized that monetary
policy should gear toward positive real rates of return and that central bank credit to
banks should be restrained.
Directors noted the recent developments in the foreign exchange market and the
authorities’ commitment to a unified exchange rate. They encouraged the authorities to

manage the exchange rate more flexibly and maintain a strong international reserve
position.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to strengthen the banking sector and agreed
on the need to raise minimum capital adequacy and provision cover and put in place a
comprehensive contingency preparedness framework. Directors noted that additional
steps are needed to further reduce the large non-performing loan portfolio and that bank
profitability would benefit from allowing banks more flexibility in setting rates of return
and reducing operating costs. They supported the recent decision to increase the
central bank’s supervisory powers, but underscored that full autonomy would be
necessary for the central bank to exercise its enforcement powers.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ reform strategy based on privatization, a reduction
of the role of the government, and market-based prices for energy and agricultural
goods, with a view to achieving higher employment and growth. They considered it
critical to restructure the enterprise sector through the adoption of energy-efficient
technologies, while stressing the need to support the development of new growth
sectors through labor market reforms, including adequate unemployment benefits.
Directors also agreed that the full removal of subsidies and steadfast implementation of
the ongoing tax and customs reforms are essential to further reduce Iran’s dependency
on oil and natural gas.
Directors noted the progress made in enhancing Iran’s AML/CFT framework, and urged
the authorities to step up efforts to bring the existing framework in line with international
standards.
Many Directors noted the authorities’ concern about the impact of sanctions on the
transfer of oil export proceeds, including potential adverse effects on oil markets, and
some Directors called on the staff to monitor and assess Iran’s access to the
international payment system.
Directors considered that economic data are broadly adequate for surveillance
purposes, and encouraged the authorities to improve the timeliness of data provision.

Statement by Jafar Mojarrad, Executive Director for the Islamic Republic of Iran
July 20, 2011
1.
My authorities thank staff for an excellent set of papers and the constructive dialogue
during the Article IV discussions. The authorities concur with staff assessment and policy
recommendations. The discussions rightly focused on maintaining macroeconomic stability,
sustaining high growth, and strengthening the financial sector. My authorities also wish to
express their appreciation for the high-quality Fund technical assistance and advice.
Economic Developments and Outlook
2.
Non-oil GDP growth picked up over the past two years, reflecting the global
economic recovery, a strong rebound in agriculture production, and structural reforms.
Despite the global recession and the economic sanctions, growth rates in recent years have
been positive, but far below the potential of the Iranian economy. The authorities are mindful
that reaching and sustaining higher growth rates would be vital for creating job opportunities
for a growing labor force, particularly the youth. They are of the view that Iran’s potential
growth rate is much higher than that projected by staff, and envisage an annual growth rate of
8 percent over the period of the Fifth Five-Year Development Plan (5th FYDP 2010–15).
3.
Inflation has been brought down significantly from 25.4 percent in 2008/09 to
12.4 percent in 2010/11 through effective monetary policy. It is expected to increase to
22 percent in 2010/11 due to the step price increases stemming from the subsidy reform (see
below), but to moderate to 7 percent over the medium term.
4.
The current account surplus improved to 6 percent of GDP in 2010/11, up from
3 percent in 2009/10, reflecting higher oil prices and will remain in surplus over the medium
term. The fiscal surplus increased from 0.7 percent of GDP in 2008/09 to 1.7 percent
in 2010/11 due to the authorities’ prudent spending policy as well as higher oil revenue. The
fiscal balance is expected to remain in surplus over the medium term.

2
Subsidy Reform
5.
My authorities have carried out a comprehensive subsidy reform, which is one of the
most important market reforms in 30 years. On December 19, 2010, the government ended
the decades-long subsidy program for fuel and a broad range of other commodities, and
replaced it with direct cash transfers to households of about US$40 per month per person.
The reform reduced the annual cost of subsidies on food, fuel, and electricity by
US$60 billion, about 15 percent of the GDP. Implementing a reform of such magnitude has
required extensive preparations and planning, as outlined in the staff report and detailed in a
staff working paper.10 The reform was preceded by a far-reaching public relations campaign
to educate the population on the growing economic costs and environmental damage of low
energy prices as well as the expected long-term benefits from the reform. Consumers were
instructed on how to reduce wasteful use of energy and on the value of installing insulation,
while industry was encouraged to improve energy efficiency and upgrade technology.
6.
Broad consensus and extensive public support have been critical in the successful
implementation of the first phase of the reform. This phase, which has entailed a substantial
increase in energy products’ prices, in some instances by up to twenty times, has been
successfully implemented. Nevertheless, many challenges lie ahead, and with continued
public support, the next phases of the reform are expected to be equally smooth.
7.
The reform has slashed local energy demand, which has resulted in reducing chronic
pollution and increasing available crude oil for export. It has dramatically raised disposable
income of the poor, spreading social equity while boosting private non-energy consumption.
Poverty incidence is estimated to have declined from 12 percent to 2 percent and regional
disparities in poverty have sharply declined.
Medium-and Long-Term Framework
8.
The authorities’ objective over the medium to long term is to maintain
macroeconomic stability, transition to a market economy, reduce the role of government,
accelerate privatization of public enterprises, and reform labor and product markets. The
policy framework for achieving these goals is laid out in the Twenty-Year Vision document
and the 5th FYDP, which seeks to achieve sustained annual economic growth rate of 8 percent
on average and increase employment opportunities.
9.
The objectives of the plan also include further economic diversification to
substantially reduce the government’s dependence on oil and gas revenues, elimination of
subsidies, and a reduction in the gap between the rich and the poor and further protection of

Subsidy Reform,” IMF Working Paper 11/167.

3
the lower segments of society. Extension of health insurance and improvement of education
and human development indicators are also among the key objectives of the Plan.
10.
To further improve the business and investment environment and to reduce the cost of
doing business, the Plan envisages the establishment of a “Dialogue Council” between the
government and the private sector. The Council will be chaired by the Minister of Finance,
with the participation of the Governor of the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) and seven ministers.
In addition, the Organization for Foreign Investment and Technical Assistance of Iran will be
further strengthened and the legal and economic environment for foreign direct investment
will be improved.
11.
In pursuing the objectives of the Plan, the authorities will continue to reform the
financial sector as highlighted in the Selected Issues Paper (SIP). In the trade area, after
carefully assessing the impact of the ongoing reforms, the authorities will proceed with
further rationalizing the tariff structure and reducing the number of items that are exempt
from import duties.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
12.
Maintaining price stability will be critical for achieving the Plan’s growth and
employment objectives as well as successfully completing the subsidy reform. The CBI will
continue its efforts to reach a consensus in the Monetary and Credit Council (MCC) to
increase the lending and deposit interest rates to contain credit growth and inflation. Also, the
CBI will continue to tighten its lending to banks through the overdraft facility, and to mop up
excess liquidity through the issuance of CBI participation paper.
13.
As noted by the staff, the exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals and the
managed float regime continues to serve the economy well. Going forward, the exchange rate
will continue to be managed flexibly, taking into account monetary policy objectives, the
need to maintain a unified exchange rate system, as well as developments in Iran’s
competitiveness.
Fiscal Policy Reforms
14.
My authorities are well aware of the need to maintain fiscal sustainability over the
medium term and reduce dependence on oil revenue. To this effect, they plan to strengthen
revenue mobilization, rationalize current spending, and ensure high-quality capital
expenditure. A key priority objective over the medium term is to ensure that non-oil revenue
fully cover current expenditure. In this connection, the VAT rate will be increased annually
by one percentage point over the next five years from its current rate of 3 percent. Moreover,
to enhance compliance, an audit software will be implemented and a zero rate will be applied
for all tax exemptions. To further strengthen fiscal buffers, 20 percent of oil revenue will be

4
saved in the newly established National Development Fund while oil proceeds in excess of
the budget price assumption will be channeled to the existing Oil Stabilization Fund.
Financial Sector Reforms
15.
The authorities attach high importance to the soundness of the financial system,
which is the world’s largest Islamic financial system. With the privatization of four public
banks over the past two years, the share of private banks in financial intermediation has
increased significantly. The authorities intend to take measures, as needed, to ensure that
financial institutions remain solvent and profitable. As underscored in the SIP, the CBI’s
regulatory and supervisory framework will be further strengthened and aligned with
international best practices. As a first step toward developing a comprehensive contingency
preparedness framework, a deposit guarantee fund will be established. The authorities agree
with staff on the need for a higher minimum capital adequacy and stronger liquidity buffers.
Under the 5th FYDP reforms, public banks will be allowed to retain after-tax profits into
capital upon government approval.
16.
My authorities continue to strongly support international efforts in the area of antimoney laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) and have made
considerable efforts to fully implement the adopted measures. In their efforts to enhance the
existing framework to meet international best practices, a Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU)
was established on February7, 2010 and a draft CFT law, incorporating the Fund’s Legal
Department’s recommendations is expected to be ratified soon by Parliament. In addition, the
authorities have made extensive efforts to strengthen cooperation between Iran and other
countries and international organizations actively involved in AML/CFT, including the
FATF. Measures are also underway for Iran to gain membership in the Egmont group and
regional FATFs. The authorities look forward to further IMF technical assistance to examine
progress in developing the AML/CFT framework and the operation of the FIU and provide
further recommendations while sharing the staff TA reports with the Board.
Risk of Spillover of the Sanctions on Oil Markets
17.
As a large oil and gas exporter, Iran plays an important role in maintaining market
stability. With its vast endowment in oil and gas resources, Iran has actual and potential
capacity to support the global energy needs and meet the rising demand. However, my
authorities consider that the imposition of unilateral and extraterritorial barriers for foreign
investment in Iran’s energy sector is counterproductive at a time when the world economy is
confronted with supply scarcity. Of more concern are the recent difficulties created for the
transfer of oil export proceeds to Iran by oil importers through the international payment and
settlement system. Should these restrictions remain in place, Iran would have no choice but
to cut oil and gas supplies to the interested parties, with possible spillovers to the energy
markets. While my authorities remain committed to the integrity and effectiveness of the
global financial and payment system, they believe that the Fund, as the guardian of global

5
financial stability, has a role to play in ensuring the smooth functioning of the multilateral
payment system for the benefit of the international community. My authorities are ready to
provide management and Fund staff with all necessary information to allow the Fund to form
a view on this issue and play a role in facilitating Iran’s free access to the international
payment and settlement system.
