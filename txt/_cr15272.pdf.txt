IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with The Gambia
On September, 18, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with The Gambia.
The Gambia has experienced large balance of payments and fiscal imbalances, caused by
persistent policy slippages in recent years and financial difficulties in public enterprises. This was
exacerbated by sizable exogenous shocks from the impact of the regional Ebola outbreak on
tourism and the delayed summer rains in 2014. The authorities embarked on an economic
program based on a strong 2015 budget and structural reforms, and efforts to secure donor
support. The Fund supported the authorities’ efforts through a Rapid Credit Facility (RCF)
disbursement in early April 2015 and a Staff-Monitored Program (SMP).
However, major policy slippages have occurred since the RCF disbursement, pushing the SMP
off track and worsening the outlook considerably especially since budget support from donors
will not be forthcoming. In early May 2015, the President’s office issued a directive imposing an
exchange rate overvalued by more than 20 percent compared to the prevailing market rates,
which the Fund staff assessed to be broadly in equilibrium. The fiscal position too has
deteriorated significantly since mid-April, while inflationary pressures and T-bill rates have
increased, reflecting the inconsistent macroeconomic policies. In the absence of corrective
policies, The Gambia’s external viability and fiscal sustainability could be at serious risk.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted that a cycle of exogenous shocks followed by policy slippages had led
to weaker real GDP growth in The Gambia than in other countries of the region. Directors
regretted that recent policy slippages have worsened an already difficult macroeconomic
situation and are threatening The Gambia’s near- and medium-term growth prospects.
Accordingly, they called for strong corrective measures to address the growing macroeconomic
imbalances and bring policies back on track to achieve the objectives of the authorities’

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any

economic program monitored by Fund staff. Directors agreed that bold action on a variety of
fronts, including targeted structural reforms, is urgently needed to restore policy credibility,
rebuild policy buffers, re-engage development partners and achieve The Gambia’s poverty
alleviation goals.
Directors stressed that an ambitious and sustained fiscal adjustment is necessary to bring the
fiscal situation under control. They encouraged the authorities to implement the measures in the
current budget and to identify soon additional measures for a deep budget restructuring beginning
in 2016. Such an adjustment will create space for development spending while fostering
macroeconomic stability and social progress over the medium term. Directors also highlighted
the need to articulate a strategy to overhaul public enterprises in the energy and
telecommunication sectors to stem their demand on budget resources.
Directors welcomed the Central Bank of The Gambia’s continued efforts to shore up financial
stability. They commended steps underway to improve bank supervision and crisis management
capacity. Directors observed that the flexible exchange rate regime had served The Gambia well,
and agreed that the exchange directive currently in force to limit exchange rate flexibility should
be rescinded immediately.
Directors welcomed The Gambia’s significant social gains over the past years but noted that
there remains ample room to enhance inclusive growth and competitiveness. They encouraged
the authorities to step up agricultural reforms and improve infrastructure in energy and transport
to enhance economic diversification and resilience to shocks.

THE GAMBIA
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
August 4, 2015

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Context. The Gambia’s large balance of payments and fiscal imbalances, caused by policy
slippages and persistent financial difficulties in public enterprises, were exacerbated by the
impact of the regional Ebola outbreak on tourism and the delayed summer rains in 2014,
which widened the imbalances further. The Fund supported The Gambia with an RCF
disbursement in early April 2015 to meet the urgent balance of payments needs arising from
these shocks. The authorities also embarked on an economic program with a strong 2015
budget and structural reforms to be monitored under a staff-monitored program (SMP), and
efforts to secure donor support.
Outlook and risks. Major policy slippages have occurred since the RCF disbursement,
pushing the SMP off track and worsening the outlook considerably, especially since budget
support grants will not be forthcoming. In early May 2015, The Office of the President issued
a directive imposing an exchange rate overvalued by about 30 percent, while the fiscal
position has deteriorated significantly since mid-April. In the absence of corrective policies,
The Gambia’s external viability and fiscal sustainability could be at serious risk.
Rebuilding confidence. The exchange rate directive has been highly counterproductive, as it
severely erodes exports and government revenue, and should be rescinded immediately.
Expenditure pressures thus far this year should be unwound and contingency measures, in
addition to those stipulated in the 2015 budget, should be implemented promptly to support
the fiscal position in 2015, restore confidence, and reinvigorate donor support.
Buttressing fiscal and external sustainability. It is essential to rebuild fiscal buffers to
sustain macroeconomic stability and social progress over the medium term. The authorities
should articulate expeditiously measures to realize a deep budget restructuring beginning in
2016 to reduce T-bill rates substantially and create space for priority spending. Concrete
medium-term actions need to be delineated to reposition and restructure the energy and
telecommunication sectors to shore up fiscal sustainability from 2016 onwards and enhance
prospects for growth and competitiveness. Such overarching fiscal consolidation and
structural reforms would help ensure external sustainability.
Promoting inclusive growth and competitiveness. In light of the elevated level of public
debt, the government should prioritize infrastructure investments which should help address
poverty and improve the business environment. The authorities are encouraged to continue
their efforts to improve supervision capacity to enhance financial stability.

THE GAMBIA

BACKGROUND
1.
Historically, The Gambia’s growth performance has been mediocre, characterized by
repeated weather-related shocks. The Gambia’s real per capita GDP growth over 2004–14
averaged less than ½ percent per year, among the lowest in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). As a
consequence, The Gambia remains among the poorest countries in the world. Over the last 50 years,
The Gambia has been hit by eleven instances of drought, with four in just the last 12 years. This has
contributed significantly to The Gambia’s inability to sustain uninterrupted periods of growth. Since
1965, The Gambia has had just three short-lived episodes—a combined duration of 16 years—of
growth spells, i.e., periods of real per capita growth in excess of 2 percent.1 The remaining years, The
Gambia had low or negative per-capita growth. This includes three spells of a combined duration of
22 years in which per-capita growth was negative. The Gambia’s growth performance displays
fragile state characteristics.2
2.
This pattern has continued in recent years as persistent policy slippages, exacerbated
by sizable exogenous shocks, have intensified macroeconomic pressures. Persistent slippages,
characterized in particular by very loose fiscal policy, increased significantly macroeconomic
vulnerabilities over 2013–14. In addition, while The Gambia has been Ebola free, its tourism industry
was hit by a large shock associated with the regional Ebola outbreak which is estimated to have cut
tourism receipts for the 2014/15 season by more than half. The country is benefitting from the
presently lower global fuel prices, but the net impact of the shocks on the balance of payments is
estimated to be $40 million during 2014‒15 (over 5 percent of 2015 GDP). Furthermore, the delayed
summer rains in 2014 led to about a 15 percent decline of the year’s crop with serious implications
for real GDP and food security. As a consequence, the already large current account and fiscal
deficits expanded substantially (Figure 1, Tables 1‒7). Faced with mounting pressures, the exchange
rate depreciated by about 10 percent during the first four months of 2015 while inflation has been
hovering around 6½‒7¼ percent since late 2014, up from around 5½ percent in the summer of
2014. The Fund supported The Gambia with an RCF disbursement in early April 2015 and through a
staff-monitored program (SMP).
3.
The persistent pattern of external shocks and policy slippages in recent years has led
to the erosion of all policy buffers. The public debt stock rose from just below 70 percent of GDP
at end-2010 to 100 percent by end-2014. Meanwhile, the gross official reserves’ import coverage
has declined from 6 months at end-2012 to below 3 months now. Reserves’ import coverage is even

The benchmark for desired per capita GDP growth is based on the cross-country analysis in Berg et al (2012) (see
Annex II).

Using the same methodology as in Annex II, the IMF Policy paper, The Macroeconomic and Operational Challenges
of Countries in Fragile Situations, June 2011, reports that over 1960-2009, fragile states had equal numbers of upbreaks and down-breaks in growth, while non-fragile LICs had nearly twice as many up-breaks as down-breaks.

lower after accounting for a swap operation conducted in April 2015 that has temporarily boosted
reserves by $20 million.3
4.
Progress in implementing past Fund policy advice has been mixed (Box 1). Domestic
fuel prices have been adjusted to eliminate subsidies. The authorities’ continued efforts to
strengthen revenue administration helped to raise the revenue-to-GDP ratio from 16½ percent in
2012 to 18¾ percent in 2014. Despite these efforts on the revenue side, sizable extra-budgetary
spending pressures and the fiscal burden arising from the financial difficulties of key public
enterprises worsened the fiscal position considerably (see IMF Country Report No. 15/104)—the
government’s net domestic borrowing (NDB) surged from 3½ percent of GDP in 2012 to 12¼
percent of GDP in 2014. The government’s domestic borrowing needs have been met substantially
by the Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG) financing. The CBG has deployed its available instruments
to tighten the monetary policy stance, but its policy conduct has been severely complicated by the
government’s financing requirements and the temporary impositions of over-valued exchange rates
by the Office of the President—October 2012 through November 2012, June 2013 through October
2013, and May 2015 to present (see below).

5.
The authorities’ SMP recognized the need for strong policy actions augmented by
substantial donor budget support to address their difficulties. The 2015 budget aimed at
lowering net domestic borrowing (NDB) to 1 percent of GDP in 2015 from 12¼ percent in 2014, with
broadly equal contributions from savings measures and external budget support, including the RCF
disbursement. The authorities also intended to address the financial problems of key public
enterprises to limit their drain on the state budget. These steps were expected to stabilize the
macroeconomic situation in 2015 and give the authorities the time needed to develop their
medium-term adjustment plans. Policy implementation until mid-April 2015 was broadly in line with
commitments in the authorities’ Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) for the
SMP.
6.
With continued strong policy implementation the near- and medium-term economic
outlook was seen to be positive. Real GDP growth was expected to rebound strongly driven by the
recovery of agriculture and tourism activity while the envisaged fiscal consolidation and reforms
under the MEFP were supposed to bring the public debt to a sustainable path, as illustrated in the
baseline macro framework tables in the Staff Report for the RCF request (see IMF Country Report
No. 15/104). The strategy set out in the SMP was also intended to lay the foundation for The

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
7.
Since mid-April 2015, major policy slippages have reemerged, worsening considerably
the economic outlook. International reserves have underperformed relative to the SMP with
confidence in policies slow to return. Furthermore, as modest pressures on the exchange rate
manifested itself with the onset of the lean season for foreign exchange receipts, the Office of the
President issued a directive in early May fixing the exchange rate at a level overvalued by more than
20 percent compared with prevailing market rates which were slightly overvalued (see the exchange
rate assessment in Annex I).4 The T-bill rates which had started to edge down earlier in the year
reversed the trend and recently ticked up to over 20 percent while the commercial banks’
subscription of T-bills in recent auctions dropped drastically rendering the CBG’s intensified open
market operations ineffective (Box 2).5

Since late-2012, the Office of the President has issued
a series of exchange rate directives. Except for the
latest, which was issued in early May 2015 and is still
in effect, all directives were lifted after a period of a
few weeks to a few months since their imposition. The
directives, which were issued as press releases
imposing a GMD/$ exchange rate at levels
appreciated relative to the prevailing market rates and
often accompanied by an initial ban on the shipment
of foreign exchange (FX) abroad and other restrictions
to eliminate speculation and illegal FX trading. The
most recent directive also sets ceiling rates for other
major foreign currencies. Compliance by formal FX
market participants is monitored through their daily FX
returns to the CBG while enforcement agents from the
Office of the President monitor closely activities of FX
bureaus and other unlicensed dealers.

Other negative consequences include loss of government
revenue from taxes on imports, additional hardship to
poor families associated with the lowered dalasi value of
their remittances, and increased market risks for the
financial sector. Directives also weaken the CBG’s ability
to manage the flexible exchange rate by making it
difficult for the CBG to accumulate foreign exchange
reserves for buffers and for intervention when needed.

To avert the FX shortage, parallel market trading tends
to occur discreetly at exchange rates above those
stipulated by the directive. Past experience shows that
once the directive is lifted, the likelihood of
overshooting is low as agents self regulate the
exchange rate movements to prevent directives from
re-emerging. Shortages of imported basic commodities
due to foreign exchange shortages create inflationary
pressure during episodes of directives (CPI inflation
figure).

8.
The government’s NDB has been increasing sharply since mid-April 2015 and, together
with the inconsistent exchange rate policy, has pushed the SMP off track. Revenue collections
remained strong until April, but started slowing down in May as the overvalued exchange rates have
lowered the base on which import duties and the VAT on imports are applied. Strong spending
pressures have reemerged recently, partly due to delayed implementation of the expenditure saving
measures listed in the MEFP of the SMP for 2015, particularly the downsizing of embassies and of
the fleet of official vehicles. Extra-budgetary spending magnified pressures. As a result of these
policy slippages, the SMP’s end-June NDB indicative target was missed by a wide margin, as were
the net international reserves (NIR) and net domestic assets (NDA) indicative targets (Table 8).
Implementation of the structural agenda under the SMP is behind schedule thus far (Table 9). The
financially distressed state-owned companies (SOEs)—the National Water and Electricity Company
(NAWEC) and Gambia Telecommunications and its subsidiary cellular company
(GAMTEL/GAMCEL)—have been unable to remain within their budgeted cash flow. Meanwhile, The
Gambia Groundnut Corporation (GGC) was recently directed to sell farmers fertilizer at a price that
did not cover its import costs under its new business mandate to market and sell all agricultural
products and ensure food security. These SOEs will be an additional fiscal burden in coming months.

already come under strain
in the first half of the year. These developments and the higher-than-budgeted fuel prices it will face
in the second half of the year indicates that it could run an operational loss of about 1½ percent of
GDP. Similarly, GAMTEL and GAMCEL are expected to run an operational deficit of around
¼ percent of GDP each in 2015 due to its shrinking customer base. As a result, even if the
authorities rescind the directives immediately and implement all short-term fiscal saving measures
recommended by the staff in addition to those committed under the SMP (see ¶17–18), the NDB is
expected to reach 5¼ percent of GDP in 2015, compared with the target of 1 percent of GDP under
the SMP.6 Under the staff proposed scenario where the authorities implement all medium-term
consolidation measures recommended by the staff (see ¶22–23) in addition to the above-mentioned
short term measures, the total public debt dynamics for the next several years has worsened
compared with the previous DSA presented at the time of the RCF request—the public debt ratio at
end-2020 would remain at around 80 percent of GDP (Figure 2, text chart in ¶11). The short maturity
and higher domestic debt stock has heightened further the risk of public debt distress. However,
external public debt dynamics remain largely unchanged from those presented in the DSA at the
time of the RCF request (see IMF Country Report No. 15/104, Supplement 1) and risk of external
debt distress remains moderate (Figure 3). Temporary disruptions of foreign exchange supply and
import activity would lower the real GDP growth in 2015 and raise inflation in coming months
compared with the baseline projection presented at the time of the RCF request. Furthermore, the
gross international reserves’ import coverage is expected to remain below 3 months until end-2015
even with strong near-term corrective policy actions.



Policy slippages will impose heavy social and economic costs. The shortage in foreign
exchange supply will heighten inflationary pressures in coming months by reducing the
supply of imported basic goods. The Gambia is heavily dependent on remittances (see text
chart), and particularly among the poor, the lowered dalasi value of their remittances would
hit hard, adding to their economic difficulties associated with higher inflation. Such
developments would also significantly increase The Gambia’s vulnerabilities given its
exposure to natural disasters, and also to global economic developments, particularly a
potential slowdown in advanced economies which are the sources of tourism receipts and
remittances to the country (Table 10).8

12.
In the absence of urgent corrective action, the social progress made in recent years
would also be under threat. In the downside scenario presented in ¶11, the interest payment could
consume almost 50 percent of government revenue by 2016, leaving no space for poverty reduction
and growth oriented spending. Furthermore, inflation would rise and hit the poor particularly hard
as illustrated in ¶11.
13.
The authorities were divided on the likely medium-term outlook and assessment of
associated risks. While many government officials agreed with the staff’s projections and
assessment, other senior officials expressed a different view, especially as regards the efficacy of the
exchange rate directives. They argued that the level at which the exchange rate had been fixed was
broadly adequate and it would benefit the poor segment of the population by containing inflation.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
14.
The Gambia’s near-term difficulties as well as its longer-term growth experience point
to establishing and sustaining macroeconomic stability as a key imperative. The current
conjuncture poses grave risks. With buffers severely eroded, immediate corrective actions are
required to prevent the economic imbalance spiraling out of control. A forced adjustment would be
very costly for The Gambia, particularly among socially vulnerable groups. A broad range of
measures are needed to foster fiscal sustainability and improve the environment for private sector
growth over the medium term. To this end, deep budget restructuring is urgently needed. Beyond
that, reforms to lower energy costs, improve financial sector surveillance, and eliminate structural
impediments to growth are also needed.

7

The estimated size of the current account deficit under this alternative scenario indicates that the end-2015
exchange rate projected under the RCF baseline scenario would be overvalued by about 16 percent. With some
overshooting, the exchange rate could depreciate by 20 percent initially, given the very low level of international
reserves. At that level of exchange rate, the external public debt to GDP ratio would reach 69 percent of GDP at
end-2015 but lower in NPV terms, and the external debt risk rating would remain moderate.

8

The negative impact on tourism and remittances triggered by the global slowdown would be partly offset by lower
commodity prices for imports of food and fuel.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE GAMBIA

A. Near-Term Agenda––Rebuilding Confidence
15.
It is critical that the recent exchange rate directive is rescinded immediately and The
Gambia return to a flexible exchange rate policy. The flexible exchange rate policy had served
the country well. In staff’s assessment, the prevailing market exchange rates at the time of the
imposition of the directive were broadly in line with fundamentals (Box 3). The directive has already
led to a significant shortage of foreign exchange supply. In turn, this could lead to a shortage of
imported basic goods and higher inflation in coming months, as illustrated in the risk scenarios
above. The CBG should use the monetary policy tools under its control to continue leaning against
inflationary pressures. In this regard, the staff welcomes the CBG’s intention to maintain the required
reserve ratio at its presently elevated level and its recent action to raise the policy rate by one
percentage point to 23 percent. Should indications of exchange rate overshooting emerge when the
directive is rescinded, further tightening of monetary policy may be needed.9 In this context, the
staff welcomes the CBG’s intention to consider preemptively a tightening of the required reserve
ratio and commercial banks’ foreign exchange net open positions.
Box 3. The Gambia: Exchange Rate Assessment
Deteriorating macroeconomic conditions have put upward
pressure on prices and the exchange rate depreciated by
about 10 percent by April 2015 since end-2014. As modest
pressures on the exchange rate manifested itself with the onset
of the lean season for foreign exchange receipts, the Office of
the President issued a directive in early May 2015 fixing the
exchange rate at a level overvalued by more than 20 percent
compared with prevailing market rates, which were already
slightly appreciated according to the staff’s exchange rate
assessment.
The Gambia’s current account position, under the RCF
baseline scenario, assessed using the EBA-lite methodology,
suggests that current account dynamics are in line with
fundamentals. In analyzing current account developments, the
EBA methodology makes a distinction between the size of current
account attributable to fundamentals and that attributable to a
policy gap. Taking into account the contribution of the policy gap,
the current account norm is estimated to be a deficit of about
10¾ percent of GDP in 2015. This indicates that the projected
current account balance is worse than the norm by 3.2 percent of
GDP—suggesting an overvaluation by 8.5 percent, under the
baseline scenario with the flexible exchange rate regime and the
rate at its pre-directive level.

THE GAMBIA

that the required reserve ratio, although a blunt instrument, provided an effective way to manage
liquidity and to contain exchange rate pressures. In the past, when open market operations were
ineffective in controlling exchange rate pressures, the CBG effectively controlled banking sector
liquidity using the required reserve ratio and they are prepared to use this tool in the current
circumstances. Staff cautioned that the CBG’s ability to manage a flexible exchange rate regime has
been undermined by policy inconsistency and uncertainty caused by the repeated presidential
directives. Foreign exchange shortages arising from the directive have limited the CBG’s ability to
build up foreign exchange reserves that are needed to cushion the economy from shocks and to
intervene in the market to maintain orderliness when there is a need. Furthermore, fiscal dominance
has put additional pressure on the CBG’s stock of international reserves. To strengthen its ability to
manage a flexible exchange rate regime in the medium term, the CBG plans to introduce repos, a
short term market-based instrument, to enhance its liquidity management capacity. While the CBG
has received significant TA on repos and preparatory work is underway, staff has advised the
authorities to delay the launching until this period of fiscal dominance has ended and the CBG has
regained control of its balance sheet. The CBG should also ensure that the foreign exchange market
is well functioning and sufficiently liquid to allow price discovery. This requires policy consistency,
immediate rescinding of the directive, and also improving debt management capacity.
17.
The staff urged the authorities to implement quickly measures committed under the
SMP to shore up the NDB target in 2015. As illustrated above, the imposition of the exchange
directive has already altered the economic and fiscal situation facing The Gambia materially. The
authorities need to unwind the expenditure pressures that have emerged in recent months,
including putting in place the few expenditure saving measures for 2015 listed in their MEFP that are
yet to be implemented to shore up the NDB target. The sales of government-owned land plots,
which are expected to create privatization receipts of 0.6 percent of GDP, should take place
promptly. The government should also help NAWEC secure the second ECOWAS grant
disbursement and introduce a levy of GMD10 on each bill it issues beginning in July 2015 to cover
partially the cost of street lights, as committed under the SMP to buttress the cash flow of NAWEC.
18.
However, to bring the NDB close to the target established under the SMP, the
authorities would need to go beyond the measures identified in the 2015 budget. In light of
the recent policy slippages, including the imposition of the exchange rate directive, the budget
support grants from donors, expected at around $22 million in the 2015 budget, are not likely to
materialize, except for the health sector support grant of $5 million from the World Bank. The
authorities are advised to get a firm grip on key public enterprises’ (NAWEC, GAMTEL, and GAMCEL)
cash flow and establish a monthly monitoring mechanism promptly. The staff strongly advised that
the expanded business mandate of GGC should be put on hold before thorough business and
financial analyses are completed. It is imperative that the authorities immediately stop funding the
budget lines identified as a contingency in the 2015 budget.10 In addition, the authorities should

The identified contingency in the budget originally amounted to 1.1 percent of GDP, but the funding of these lines

expanded downsizing of the diplomatic missions and
rationalization of official vehicles would materialize only after 2015, but such measures would create
larger permanent savings (see ¶23). The government should also identify additional measures to
lower the NDB for the year as close as possible to the 1 percent of GDP as committed in the SMP.

19.
Strong efforts by the authorities to bring the NDB close to the target in 2015 and to
implement structural reforms under the SMP must be complemented by renewed efforts to
attract more budget support grants after 2015 to ease the required fiscal consolidation. For
the past several years The Gambia has received significantly smaller amounts of budget support
from donors compared with other countries in the region (see text chart), in large part on account of
its record of weak policy implementation. With improved policies and more active engagement with
donors, there is much room for The Gambia to enhance the support it receives from donors.
Enhanced donor support would help reduce the size of needed consolidation measures in 2016,
discussed in ¶23, and reduce the domestic interest payment burden after 2016.
20.
The authorities indicated that embarking on the recommended exchange rate and
fiscal policies would have to await a consensus among the authorities on the assessment of
macroeconomic risks. The CBG though shared the staff’s concern on inflationary pressures and
indicated that it was ready to further tighten the monetary policy stance, if necessary.

B. Medium-Term Agenda––Addressing Risks and Enhancing Growth
Buttressing Fiscal Sustainability
21.
Creating fiscal buffers is essential to sustain macroeconomic stability and social
progress over the medium term. The Gambia’s experience indicates that repeated episodes of
policy slippages, especially in the form of overspending, followed exogenous shocks. Furthermore, in
recent years as external pressures emerged, the authorities resorted to exchange directives that are
counter-productive to macroeconomic stability. The Gambia needs to move away from this cycle by
rebuilding buffers and putting in place strong fiscal institutions that will allow more consistent
implementation of good macroeconomic policies. Such developments, together with structural
reforms and targeted investment in infrastructure, will help spur economic diversification and high
growth that will help reduce poverty. Sustained strong policy implementation will also facilitate a
stronger response from donors when shocks occur, enhancing The Gambia’s ability to withstand
shocks.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE GAMBIA

22.
The staff urged the authorities to develop quickly measures to realize a deep
restructuring of the budget beginning in 2016. To bring down the T-bill rates to levels consistent
with fiscal sustainability, the government’s NDB in 2016 should be contained close to the target of
½ percent of GDP under the SMP as indicated in the updated DSA (Figure 3). Given the one-off
nature of some measures in 2015, and the higher than projected T-bill rates expected to prevail,
significant additional saving measures will be necessary in 2016, beyond those to support the 2015
target.
23.
The staff advised the authorities to promptly articulate the following measures to be
implemented beginning in 2016:



Streamlining the size of the public sector, including but not limited to a reduction of the
number of ministries and government agencies;



Implementing comprehensive civil service reforms to reduce substantially the number of
personnel in the central administration and government agencies, and hence the wage bill
beginning in 2016;



Developing and strictly enforcing a new vehicles entitlement policy which restricts the access
to official vehicles to those at and above permanent secretary levels, redesigning a new
government vehicle scheme to keep the capital, maintenance, and running costs of
government vehicles under control, including possible introduction of monetizing and
capping such benefits, while selling all redundant vehicles;




Further downsizing diplomatic missions in addition to that implemented in 2015; and
Streamlining the country’s membership in non-financial international organizations, which
have been under the authorities’ consideration.

These measures would contribute significantly towards bringing down the NDB to about 1 percent
of GDP in 2016 (Box 4), but as the estimated savings are preliminary, the authorities should be ready
to take additional measures if needed. Such a fiscal effort should reduce the T-bill rates substantially
during 2016, and create space for priority spending within the NDB target of ½ percent of GDP after
2017. This fiscal path would be consistent with

The optimal level of reserves under the alternative policy slippage scenario is estimated at 5¼ months of imports
(Annex I). In light of the weak policy implementation capacity characterized by repeated policy slippages in recent
years and the country’s high vulnerability to external shocks, the staff and the CBG shared the view that it was
appropriate for The Gambia to target a level of the international reserves of about 5‒6 months of imports.

Box 4. The Gambia: Possible Measures to Create Permanent Budget Savings
Since the program supported by the previous ECF went off track in late 2013 mainly due to fiscal
overspending, the staff and the MOFEA and other government officials have intensely discussed possible
expenditure measures which could create significant amount of permanent fiscal savings. Based on such
discussions, the staff sees room to create sizable savings in the following areas:
 Streamlining the size of the public sector. There are 22 ministries, 6 ministerial offices in the central
government, and numerous subvention agencies. Meanwhile, the number of non-security civil service
staff at the ministries and ministerial offices has increased by more than 50 percent since 2007. Staff
estimates that a reduction of the wage bill by at least 20 percent could be implemented even with
significant salary increases by substantially reducing the number of ministries and government agencies,
as well as civil service personnel. A comprehensive public sector reform that encompasses all functions
of the state would be needed to achieve permanent budget savings, improve efficiency and bring the
costs of running the state within the resource envelope available to the government.
 Reforming the official vehicle policy. Total number of official vehicles is estimated at around 1,500 at
the ministries and ministerial offices. Fuel and maintenance costs of these vehicles are fully covered by
the budget. While only the officials above a certain grade are entitled to use official vehicles, the rule is
not enforced strictly and it is allegedly often abused. By strictly limiting access to the usage of official
vehicles, most of such vehicles could be auctioned off. Staff estimates that such auctioning off would
create privatization proceeds of about 1 percent of GDP in 2016 and permanent budget savings of about
¼ percent of GDP in fuel and maintenance costs.
 Downsizing diplomatic mission. During the course of the discussions to bring the ECF back on track,
the authorities indicated that the government could create a permanent saving of up to about 1 percent
of GDP by closing down the embassies with lower strategic importance.
 Rationalizing The Gambia’s memberships in non-financial international organizations. Similarly, the
authorities examined the possibility to substantially reduce the number of the country’s memberships in
various international and regional organizations. It was estimated that it could create a saving of 0.1
percent of GDP by terminating memberships to lower priority organizations.

24.
The authorities should firm up expeditiously the medium-term restructuring strategy
on the energy and telecommunication sectors. This is critical to secure the planned fiscal
adjustment over the medium term. The government is currently studying the recently received
World Bank funded experts’ report on a comprehensive energy sector reform strategy, with a view
to articulating its medium-term action plans by end-September 2015. This will help secure the
World Bank’s energy sector support loan and donors’ support to finance critical investments and
build institutional capacity in the sector during 2016‒17. By 2018, The Gambia is expected to be
connected to a regional hydropower grid that could reduce the energy generation cost by as much
as 90 percent, and help improve considerably the financial health of the energy sector and
competitiveness of the country. With the help of the World Bank, the authorities are working out a
detailed time-bound action plan for the next three years to substantially improve the performance
of the telecommunication sector, with a view to completing it by March 2016. The envisaged reform
plan could include (i) liberalizing the international voice gateway; (ii) promoting open access to
telecommunications infrastructure and acceleration of broad band access; (iii) privatizing
GAMTEL/GAMCEL; and (iv) modernizing the institutional and regulatory framework for the sector to
meet international best practice.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE GAMBIA

25.
While the staff welcomes the recent progress made to improve public debt
management, prudent macroeconomic policy would be a key to avoid debt distress. The
relevant departments of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs (MOFEA) and the CBG hold a
monthly meeting on both domestic and external debt to improve information exchange, which will
lead to better forecasting of interest payments. The MOFEA recently sent to major SOEs a template
for the database on debt and contingent liabilities with a view to completing the database by end2015. It will help the authorities to plan ahead necessary contingency measures to deal with
potential financial difficulties of state-owned enterprises after 2016. However, comprehensive fiscal
consolidation and structural reforms in electricity and telecommunication sectors would have to be
the cornerstone of efforts to protect the country from an elevated risk of public debt distress.
26.
At the technical level the authorities concurred with the staff on the need to
implement a deep budget restructuring beginning in 2016, but the political commitment for
such actions is still lacking. The economic team, the MOFEA and the CBG, shared the mission’s
assessment of the urgency of the fiscal situation and the need for bold consolidation measures.
However, the sensitive nature of the needed measures will require political support at the highest
level. In the absence of a strong consensus among all government officials on the need for such
measures, the process to secure the political support cannot be launched. Nonetheless, the staff
advised the economic team to start preparing at a technical level measures to realize a deep
restructuring of the budget to be implemented in 2016.
Shoring Up Financial Stability and Enhancing Financial Deepening
27.
While the banking system is well capitalized and liquid, key macro-financial risks have
emerged highlighting the damaging impact of fiscal distress on financial sector stability. Although
The Gambia’s financial soundness indicators are generally satisfactory, they mask underlying risks
associated with commercial banks’ high exposure to government debt (see text table). Credit risk
stress testing recently conducted by the CBG with

would pose the risk of rising NPLs and further crowding out credit to private sector, while exchange
rate depreciation will deepen the financial distress of SOEs.
28.
Staff encouraged the CBG to continue to step up measures to safeguard financial
stability. The recent episode with the two problem banks, which were intervened by the CBG, point
to some supervision gaps, particularly the need to upgrade credit risk stress testing, improve its
strategy to deal with weak banks, and develop a resolution and crisis management framework. The
CBG should take full advantage of the recent MCM TA mission on stress testing. The staff welcomes
the CBG’s progress in developing a bank resolution and crisis management framework which has
recently been submitted to the West African Monetary Institute (WAMI) task force on regional crisis
resolution frameworks. The commercial bank intervened by the CBG remains under its control and is
improving its financial situation. The staff advised the CBG to divest its control of the bank by early
2017 at the latest in line with the recently articulated time-bound action plan approved by the high
court. The staff advised that, in case the CBG could not find any investors for the bank within a
reasonable time frame, it should liquidate the bank.
29.
The authorities largely concurred with the staff’s assessment and recommendations on
financial sector stability. Going forward, the CBG plans to implement bank stress tests on a
quarterly basis using the new stress testing template developed with assistance from the recent
MCM TA mission. The CBG broadly agreed with the staff on the way forward to divesting the bank
which is still under its control. The CBG and MOFEA staff recognized the importance of bringing
back confidence on economic policy expeditiously to safeguard financial stability and boost financial
deepening in The Gambia.

Enhancing Prospects for Inclusive Growth and Competitiveness
30.
Although The Gambia has made visible progress in improving social indicators, there is
still significant scope to enhance prospects for inclusive growth and competitiveness. The
Gambia has made considerable efforts to improve its

poor infrastructure, all of which have contributed to holding back growth.12
31.
Staff encouraged the authorities to delineate a strategy to reduce vulnerability to
droughts with a view to avoiding repeated down breaks in growth. The government recently
began formulating a new National Development Plan (NDP)—a medium-term development
blueprint for 2017‒20—to succeed the current Programme for Accelerated Growth and Employment
(PAGE). The new NDP should prioritize continued investment in the water management system to
boost agricultural productivity and rural incomes. While the recent development of the tourism
sector has helped The Gambia diversify its economy, the PAGE recognizes the need for reforms to
make progress towards further economic diversification to benefit from untapped potential in
fisheries and agro-processing. This will require investment in infrastructure and improvement in the
business environment.
32.
In light of the elevated level of public debt, the government needs to prioritize
infrastructure investment. The total public debt to GDP ratio reached 100 percent at end-2014.
Even with the ambitious fiscal adjustments in line with the staff’s proposed scenario, this ratio would
still be above 80 percent until 2019.13 In the immediate future, a scaling up of investment is not
feasible given this debt situation, and hence strict prioritization of available resources is essential. A
few key infrastructure projects are in the pipeline: a project to connect The Gambia to the regional
hydropower grid and the Trans-Gambia River bridge construction. Given the weakness in the energy
sector and the pressing need to address rural poverty, these two projects should be accorded high
priority. These projects would also help realize the full potential of the tourism industry and reduce
reliance on agriculture. They could generate opportunities to reinvigorate The Gambia’s role as a
regional trade center.
33.
It is imperative to strengthen resource mobilization and the government’s capacity to
implement the key infrastructure projects. Given the limited budget resources, private sector
participation will be needed for timely implementation of major infrastructure projects. Meanwhile,
the government should strengthen project design, prioritization, and execution capacity. The
government’s recent efforts to strengthen the capacity to design and negotiate private-public
partnerships (PPPs) and its move toward a program-based budgeting (PBB) approach are welcome.
Staff reiterated that the authorities should not take on non-concessional external loans anymore,
highlighting the elevated level of public debt.
34.
There is room to enhance the business environment by reforming the tax system.
Business surveys indicate that a costly and complicated tax system and administration is one of the
factors holding back private investment and growth. A detailed study on tax expenditures to be
initiated in the coming months, based on the recommendations of the recent FAD TA mission,
would provide key inputs to simplify and rationalize business taxation over the medium term.
12

This is discussed in more detail in Annex I on the analysis of competitiveness.

13

The medium term anchor for fiscal policy is to lower the NDB to 0.5 percent of GDP in the medium term which
would allow public debt fall below 80 percent by 2020 and interest payments to decline significantly.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

THE GAMBIA

Meanwhile, replacing the numerous “nuisance” local business fees with an updated property tax
would help attract foreign direct investments. In order to modernize property evaluation system and
improve revenue collection of property tax, the authorities would need an intensive capacitybuilding for property evaluation in the short-term and to introduce a rolling property assessment
program over the medium term, as recommended by the FAD TA mission.
35.
The authorities are advised to step up efforts to increase access to credit and promote
private sector investment. The very high domestic interest rates are not only due to crowding out
by the public sector and the tight monetary stance but also to legal and institutional difficulties in
recovering loans and realizing collateral. In this context, the CBG with the collaboration of related
ministries has made visible progress towards developing a Collateral Registry, which became
operational in July 2015. Staff advised the CBG to encourage commercial banks to update the data
in the Credit Reference Bureau in a timely manner. These measures will help to reduce lending risks
and to lower lending rates for creditworthy borrowers.
36.
The authorities agreed with staff’s analysis and policy recommendations on inclusive
growth. They explained that addressing infrastructure gaps in energy and transportation are key
priorities. In particular, high energy costs and frequent power outages are not only a bottleneck for
promoting economic diversification. High energy costs are also a drag on the financial health of
GAMTEL/GAMCEL. They looked forward to The Gambia being connected to the regional hydro
power grid, and considered it to be an important element to boost the country’s medium term
growth prospects. The authorities expected that a completion of the Trans-Gambia Bridge,
scheduled for 2017, would greatly facilitate economic diversification, improve the productivity of the
agriculture and fishery sectors, and help reduce rural poverty.

C. Other Surveillance Issues
37.
Data provision and quality. Weaknesses in the national accounts and balance of payments
statistics continue to hamper surveillance. Capacity constraints at the Gambia Bureau of Statistics
(GBoS) and CBG, as well as insufficient source data, continue to be major obstacles to deriving
quality data. As a result, staff estimates of GDP and the BOP have often differed from the authorities’
figures. In addition, the base and the method of averaging used in calculating the consumer price
index (CPI) is outdated and there are concerns that inflation has been underestimated. GBoS has
been in the process of updating and rebasing its CPI data using the 2010 Integrated Household
Survey. The authorities have been working closely with the joint international institutions (Fund,
World Bank, AfDB, and IFAD) to improve the quality of economic and financial data, including
funding for conducting the surveys and raw data collection that are needed to derive quality
statistics.
38.
Article VIII issues. Although the exchange rate arrangement of The Gambia is classified as
floating, the Office of the President has issued five exchange rate directives that temporarily
imposed overvalued fixed exchange rates since 2012: October 22–November 15, 2012; June 26–July
15, 2013; July 26–August 14, 2013; August 14–October 8, 2013; and May 4, 2015–present (see IMF
Country Report No. 13/289). All of these directives have been rescinded, with the exception of the

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE GAMBIA

fifth directive which was issued on May 4th and is still in effect. LEG, in consultation with MCM, is
assessing if the fifth directive gives rise to exchange restrictions or multiple currency practices in
breach of The Gambia’s obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3.

STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
Persistent policy slippages and sizable exogenous shocks in 2014 led to the emergence
of serious macroeconomic vulnerabilities in The Gambia. Policy slippages since 2012, particularly
loose fiscal policy, led to widening fiscal and external current account deficits. The regional Ebola
outbreak, together with the delayed summer rains in 2014, widened these imbalances further. The
authorities embarked on an economic program with a strong 2015 budget with an ambitious
consolidation target and structural reforms.
40.
The Fund supported The Gambia with an RCF disbursement in early April 2015.
Consistent with its objective, the RCF disbursement helped The Gambia meet urgent balance of
payments needs arising from the exogenous shock with a view to smoothing adjustment and
mitigating volatility. The RCF was also expected to help catalyze further additional donor support.
Donors committed to provide such assistance, but owing to the policy slippages the committed
financing has only been partially disbursed. The Gambia did, however, benefit from increased donor
support in 2014, notably the ECOWAS grant to help reform the energy sector.
41.
The Gambian authorities committed to undertake strong policy measures monitored
under an SMP to address their acute balance of payments needs. The Gambia faces a protracted
balance of payments problem for which it needs to develop a medium-term consolidation strategy.
Good implementation of the policies under the SMP together with RCF and donor financing would
have provided The Gambian authorities the time needed to firm up such a strategy. Policy
implementation until mid-April 2015 was in line with the commitments under the SMP and the
economic outlook was positive.
42.
Policy slippages in recent months, however, severely worsened the outlook and The
Gambia is now facing a dire economic situation. The imposition of a significantly overvalued
exchange rate has exacerbated foreign exchange shortages, reduced government revenue
collection, pushed up the already-high T-bill rates, and raised inflationary pressures. Spending
pressures too have reemerged since the RCF disbursement. These policy slippages have pushed the
SMP off track and led to a suspension of donor support. In the absence of prompt implementation
of strong corrective actions, going beyond those committed under the SMP, The Gambia’s external
viability and fiscal sustainability are at grave risk.
43.
The recent policy slippages should be unwound expeditiously to rebuild confidence.
The exchange rate directive had been highly counterproductive and should be rescinded
immediately. The flexible exchange rate regime had served The Gambia well: staff’s assessment is
that the prevailing market exchange rate was broadly in equilibrium at the time the directive was
imposed. To unwind expenditure pressures thus far this year and compensate for lower budget

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

THE GAMBIA

support grant disbursements, the authorities should promptly implement contingency measures, in
addition to those stipulated in the 2015 budget. This will help support the fiscal position in 2015 and
restore confidence in economic policy implementation. The authorities should also work closely with
the donor community to ensure external budget support is brought in line with program commitments.
44.
It is vital to rebuild fiscal buffers to sustain macroeconomic stability and social
progress over the medium term. The authorities should articulate expeditiously measures to
realize a deep budget restructuring beginning in 2016 to reduce the T-bill rates substantially,
buttress medium-term fiscal sustainability, and create space for priority spending. Bold civil service
reforms to drastically reduce the wage bill, an overhaul in government’s vehicle policy, and
rationalization of diplomatic missions could create a sizable amount of permanent savings. A
medium-term strategy to restructure the energy and telecommunication sectors should be
articulated during the year to support fiscal sustainability from 2016 onwards and enhance
prospects for inclusive growth and competitiveness.
45.
Many government officials agreed with the staff on the urgent need for strong
corrective actions, but staff regrets that political support for such actions is yet to emerge.
Delaying implementation of the difficult corrective measures that will be needed could lead to a very
costly forced adjustment. The staff considers it important for the economic team to start preparing
at a technical level the necessary measures to bring economic policy back on track.
46.
The CBG’s continued efforts to shore up financial stability are welcome. Although The
Gambia’s financial soundness indicators are generally satisfactory, they mask underlying risks
associated with commercial banks’ high exposure to government debt. Steps to improve fiscal policy
implementation and restore macroeconomic stability are critical to mitigate the emerging risks in
the financial sector. In this regard, the CBG’s efforts to improve its supervision of banks and crisis
management capacity are timely. Early divestiture of the bank which was intervened by the CBG in
2014 and is still under its control, would help build confidence in the CBG’s capacity to supervise the
banking system.
47.
Although The Gambia has realized significant social gains, there remains ample room
to enhance prospects for inclusive growth and competitiveness. Poverty is concentrated in the
rural area and productivity in agriculture is low. Efforts to improve infrastructure in energy and
transportation, will be key to enhance diversification from agriculture and address rural poverty. It
will also create a better business environment, and help realize The Gambia’s full potential in
developing the tourism sector. In light of the elevated level of public debt, the government should
prioritize infrastructure investments which will help it to meet these objectives. The ongoing
construction of the Trans-Gambia Bridge and connection to the regional hybrid power grid could
considerably improve prospects for competitiveness and growth.
48.
Weak economic data continue to hamper effective policy making and surveillance.
Staff encourages the authorities working closely with the joint international institutions (Fund, World
Bank, AfDB, and IFAD) to improve the quality of economic and financial data, and ensure that
adequate resources are allocated for the production of statistical data, including staffing and

payments statistics.
49.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with The Gambia should be
held on a standard 12-month cycle.

1/ Alternative scenario assumes that the exchange rate is fixed at 40 GMD/$ until end- 2015 in line with the recently
imposed directive and fiscal slippages will continue unresolved. In particular no public enterprise reform and no corrective
actions on overspending pressures will be implemented. The fixed exchange rate will lead to a loss of competitiveness
particularly in the tourism sector and worsen the current account balance. Together, the policy slippages would lead to a loss
of confidence among investors, capital flight, discourage direct investment and a spike in T-Bill rates. External budget
support grants will be ceased throughout the period.

Domestic goods consist of (in decreasing order of importance): groundnuts, fruits and vegetables, zircon, fish, and cotton.

2

The figure for 2012 includes US$ 14.3 million in donor assistance for drought relief, which was not included in the 2012 prog. column.

3

Project grants explain the entire amount of capital account.

4

The numbers are affected by a reclassification of equity stakes in various international organizations from "official reserves assets" to "other foreign assets"on the
CBG's balance sheet. After these adjustments, effective GIR targets underthe original ECF would be US$ 193.9 million at end-2012, US$ 205.6 million at end-2013,
US$ 222.3 million at end-2014, and US$ 235.9 million at end-2015.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The
relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent,
“medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views as of the end of the discussions with
the authorities.

Annex I. External Stability Assessment1
Staff estimates from EBA-lite approach indicate that the Gambia’s exchange rate, calibrated on the
basis of the SMP’s baseline scenario with a flexible regime, is slightly overvalued: by 8½ percent.
Fund’s reserve adequacy metrics indicate that The Gambia’s 2015 projected reserve level is not
adequate, given the adjustment to shocks and policy slippages. However, the authorities have recently
introduced a directive administratively fixing the rate at a level that is overvalued by more than
20 percent compared with the prevailing market rate. Were the directive to continue, it would have
serious negative implications for external competitiveness and viability.

A. Evolution of the Balance of Payments
1.
The widening current account has led to the external balance in the Gambia
worsening. The current account deficit has been widening, mainly driven by the increasing goods
and services trade deficit (excluding re-exports). The current account deficit remains the main source
of debt creating flows.

2015, the overvalued exchange rates would also
reduce revenue collections and puts upward pressure on NDB and T-bill rates.
3.
The Gambia’s current account position, under the baseline scenario presented in the
RCF request, is assessed using the EBA-lite methodology. EBA makes a distinction between
descriptive understanding of current accounts and real exchange rates and making normative
evaluations:
Actual CA = CA Gap + (Fitted CA – Policy Gap)
The term in parentheses is the current account norm and the CA Gap is the deviation of the actual
current account from the norm, i.e., the misalignment. The term Policy Gap is the change in the
current account that results from a deviation of The Gambia’s policies from its optimal level and also
on account of the average policy misalignment relative to the rest of the world.
4.
The analysis suggests that The Gambia’s current account dynamics are broadly in line
with the fundamentals. Policy gap is estimated

The EBA-lite2 assessment is complemented by an assessment based on the external
sustainability approach. The external sustainability approach indicates that the dalasi is overvalued

by about 8½–11¾ percent.3 This is based on two
alternative benchmarks of the level at which to
stabilize the NFA-to-GDP ratio typically used in such
assessments. With the end-2014 NFA position of 86.4 percent of GDP as a benchmark, an
overvaluation is estimated at 11¾ percent. When the
benchmark is set to the average NFA position of
-120.8 percent of GDP over 2000–14, the
overvaluation is at about 8½ percent. Meanwhile,
the macro-balance approach4 indicates that the
misalignment is much smaller, overvaluation at
around 2½ percent, with the actual CA deficit in 2014.

6.
It is critical that the recent exchange rate directive is rescinded immediately to return
to a flexible exchange rate policy. The flexible exchange rate policy had served the country well.
The directive fixes the exchange rate at a level overvalued by almost 30 percent compared with the
equilibrium indicated by the EBA-lite approach. The exchange directive has already led to a
significant shortage of foreign exchange supply. This could lead to a shortage of imported basic
goods and a higher inflation in coming months. Additionally, this current directive has been more
damaging than the previous ones because of the higher overvaluation and lower level of reserve this
time around. Past experience suggests that the likelihood of overshooting, when the directive is
rescinded, is low since the financial market is shallow and agents self regulating the movement of
the exchange rate to prevent directives from re-emerging. However, should indications of exchange
rate overshooting emerge, the CBG should stand ready for further tightening of monetary policy.

C. Reserve Adequacy Assessment
7.
Given the persistence and magnitude of shocks The Gambia faces and its weak
institutional environment, strong reserve buffers should be built.



Staff’s assessment of the buffer starts with the standard Low-Income Country reserve

3

Under the external sustainability approach, the current account norm is equated to that ratio of the current account
balance to nominal output needed to stabilize the ratio of the net foreign asset position to nominal output around
its norm, which is generally equated to its most recently observed value.

4

Following the macroeconomic balance approach, the degree of exchange rate misalignment relative to mediumterm fundamentals is then inferred as that proportional change in the real effective exchange rate.

40

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE GAMBIA

adequacy metric.5 This analytical framework used to compute the optimal level of GIR is
based on a cost- benefit analysis; the optimal reserve is determined so that a country’s
benefit from holding reserves (prevention and mitigation of large external and domestic
shock events) is balanced against the associated financial cost (interest rate differential
between domestic and US treasury bills), while taking into account the country’s
fundamentals. Using this framework, the optimal level of reserve given the fundamentals of
the Gambian economy is estimated to be 3.1 months of import in 2015 assuming
opportunity cost of 3 percent.



Given The Gambia’s very weak institutional capacity, manifested in persistent policy
slippages, staff sees merit in building an additional cushion to manage shocks. Based on
past policy slippages following external and domestic shocks, staff estimates the need for an
additional cushion of 2.1 months of import to offset the associated deterioration in the
balance of payments.



As a result, a reserve buffer of 5.2 months of import is deemed necessary for The Gambia.
This represents the combination of the optimal level determined by the new reserve
adequacy framework for LICs and an additional cushion to correct for weaknesses in the
institutional and policy frameworks.

8.
Reserves are inadequate against the benchmarks determined above. Under staff’s
proposed scenario, the reserve coverage by the end of 2015 will be 2.6 months of next year import
(the yellow bar). This indicates that even in this best case scenario, reserves would be below the
calculated benchmarks. Assuming that the directive is not rescinded and the fiscal slippages are left
unaddressed, in contrast to staff’s advice, reserves would be depleted down to 1.3 months of next
year import. This suggest that The

due to the exchange rate directive, inherent structural instability, risk of high inflation caused by
global price shocks and bad weather, as well as its high reliance on food imports for subsistence,
provide strong support for the high reserve buffer estimated above. The policy mix should aim to
rebuild the reserves to 5‒6 months of imports in line with the CBG’s medium-term target.

D. Competitiveness Assessment
10.
The Gambia’s the lack of progress in addressing key institutional bottlenecks could
begin to undermine The Gambia’s relative competitiveness in the region.6 The Gambia ranks
favorably among ECOWAS members in some categories of the latest World Bank’s Doing Business
Indicators and Global Competitiveness Index. However, the cumulative change in Doing Business
score from 2008 to 2014 indicates that The Gambia has made little progress in improving its overall
business environment and is lagging behind all other ECOWAS countries by a substantial margin.
This justifies The Gambia’s recent depreciation in maintaining the economy’s external
competitiveness.

To stay competitive, The Gambia needs to augment its structural reform efforts.
According to the survey among business community, access to finance, tax policy, foreign exchange
regulations, inflation and infrastructure are among the major impediments to doing business. Even
moderate improvements in enhancing access to credit, better investor protection, and removing
impediments for paying taxes could yield large competitiveness gains for The Gambia. Ensuring the
authorities’ commitment to the flexible exchange rate regime would also improve the business
environment.

A. The Gambia’s Economic Growth Experience
1.
The Gambia’s growth in per capita terms has been low and it remains one of the
poorest countries in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA). In the past decade, The Gambia’s per capita real
GDP growth averaged less than ½ percent per year and with the level of the per capita GDP at
about US$500 in 2014, it is amongst the poorest countries in SSA (Figures 1 and 2).

Its economic growth is extremely vulnerable to repeated weather related shocks. Over
the last 50 years, The Gambia has been impacted by eleven instances of droughts, each leading to a
significant downturn in economic growth (Figure 3). Droughts tend to have a more severe effect in
The Gambia than in Senegal, which has similar weather patterns but has a more diversified economy
1

THE GAMBIA

(Figure 4). The effect of droughts on economic growth is amplified by the high level of dependence
on agriculture—over 60 percent of The Gambia’s population depends on agriculture although the
sector contributes just about 20 percent to GDP.

With a mechanism to reduce the dependence of agriculture on erratic rainfall
economic growth could be more favorable (Figure 5). Compared to the average per capita real
GDP growth of about ¼ percent reached during 2004–14, growth could have reached approximately
1½ percent if 50 percent of the agriculture shocks could have been avoided. Moreover, in the
absence of droughts, the Gambia’s growth would have been among that of high performers in SSA.
More importantly, there would have been significantly greater progress on poverty alleviation with a
mechanism to reduce the dependence on erratic rainfall, such as a robust irrigation system.

Notwithstanding low economic growth, the country has made visible progress in key
social indicators and poverty reduction. The overall incidence of poverty fell from about 58
percent in 2003 to 48 percent in 2010. Key social indicators such as education and health have also
shown significant progress but robust growth is needed to make further gains in poverty reduction.

B. Identifying and Explaining Growth Episodes in The Gambia
5.
Following Berg et al (2012), we identify and explain growth episodes in The Gambia
over the period 1965–2014. The key result is that The Gambia has not been able to sustain
uninterrupted periods of growth due to exogenous shocks (Figure 7a). The amplitude of the shocks
has declined since the mid-1980s but the frequency is still high and growth episodes have been
characterized by the following:

THE GAMBIA



The Gambia has had just three short lived episodes— a combined duration of 16 years—of
growth spells, i.e., periods of real per capita GDP growth in excess of 2 percent (Figure 7b).



The remaining years were characterized by either low or negative per capita GDP growth.
This includes three spells of a combined duration of 22 years in which average per-capita
growth was negative (Figure 7b).



In its frequency of growth breakdowns, The Gambia resembles fragile countries, although it
is not considered a fragile economy.2

Policy slippages, particularly those subsequent to external shocks, have hindered
economic growth by exacerbating macroeconomic imbalances. A pattern of repeated policy
slippages, notably, fiscal slippages and exchange rate directives was particularly evident from the
latest two shock episodes in 2011/12 and 2014/15. After the 2011 drought, despite a significant
increase in grants—4 percent of GDP increase—the government’s 2012 NDB overshot the target
adjusted for shocks by 1¼ percent of GDP due to extra-budgetary spending late in the year. The
magnitude of fiscal slippages further widened in 2013 with NDB overshooting the target by
5¼ percent of GDP. Even larger breakdown in fiscal policy happened after the Ebola and drought
related shocks in 2014/15 with the 2014 shock-adjusted NDB target overshot by about 9¼ percent

of GDP largely on account of quasi-fiscal spending on behalf of financially distressed key stateowned enterprises. While it was expected for fiscal deficits to increase due to exogenous shocks, the
actual NDB realizations went far beyond the expected shock-adjusted levels signifying a general
break down in fiscal policy. These sizeable fiscal slippages lead to spiraling interest rates and private
sector crowding out.
7.
During 2012–14, the Office of the President issued several foreign exchange directives
imposing overvalued exchange rates leading to a loss of confidence and increased policy
uncertainty. The exchange rate directives have negative effects on inflation, government revenue

Policy slippages were also prevalent during the early part of the 2002–07 negative
growth episode. There were acute difficulties in policy implementation and governance
shortcomings particularly in 2002–03 and 2005. Significantly higher than programmed fiscal deficits
were caused by expenditure overruns unrelated to drought-related shocks. The fiscal slippages were
mainly financed by the central bank causing a spike in monetary expansion, a sharp increase in
inflation rate to 17½ percent in 2003 and decline in gross international reserves.

Box 1. The Gambia: Factors Distinguishing Growth Spells and Negative Growth Episodes
Factors differentiating two distinct episodes, a growth spell
(2008–10) and a negative growth episode (2011–14) include:
Exogenous Shocks:
Despite the oil price shock in 2008, and the 2009-10 global
economic crisis, economic growth held up well during 20082010 with about 3¼ percent average growth. The resilience
of the economy to the 2009–10 global economic crisis was
due to the offsetting effect of a continued rebound in
agriculture. Contrary to this, economic growth declined by
about 1¼ percent on average during period 2011–14 on
account of two droughts in 2011 and 2014 compounded by
the effects of the 2014 drop in tourism caused by the
regional Ebola outbreak.
Policy slippages:
Fiscal policy was much more prudent during the growth
episode with a deficit of 3½ percent of GDP, on average,
compared to 7¾ percent during the negative growth spell.
While it is normal to expect some increase in the deficit, the
realized deficits went far beyond what would have been
expected under a mix of adjustment and accommodation.
The fiscal slippages of 2011–14 which were mainly financed
by the central bank and had negative effects on international
reserves and inflation.
Policy buffers:

The Gambia’s gross international reserves with import cover
peaking at 6.2 months of imports in 2009. Secondly, The Gambia had reached the completion point under
the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative in December 2007 which created some fiscal
space. These buffers helped cushion the economy from shocks during the 2008–10. However, after 2010,
policy slippages eroded buffers significantly. Policy slippages after the massive exogenous shocks in 2014
left the authorities with little wiggle room.

C. Medium-Term Strategies to Break Through the Low Growth Trap
9.
Structural reforms are needed to unlock growth potential in The Gambia and prevent
the frequent growth breakdowns it has experienced:



The agricultural sector is concentrated in crops that are vulnerable to droughts, leading to
low productivity. Measures are needed to improve productivity in agriculture sector through
investments in improved water management systems, cultivation of drought-resistant crop
varieties, and diversifying within the agriculture sector to reduce reliance on crops.
Diversifying into agro-processing activities is also needed. The authorities’ new National
Development Plan covering 2017–20 should continue to prioritize such investments.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

51

THE GAMBIA



While tourism has emerged as the main source of foreign exchange for the economy, it also
entails significant imports of goods consumed by tourists. Increasing the backward linkages
of the tourism sector with other sectors, e.g. agriculture and fisheries, would help The
Gambia to retain a larger share of value added within the country and lower the population’s
dependence on agriculture. Additional reform efforts are also needed to diversify the range
of services offered by the hospitality industry, raise the level of tourist spending and smooth
seasonality.



The Gambia River is an open natural highway for transport, which together with improved
port infrastructure, has the potential to make The Gambia a more competitive transit center
for regional trade.

10.
Diversification will require greater foreign direct investment and private sector
participation. This in turn requires making progress towards restoring macroeconomic stability and
improving the business environment. In particular, investments in infrastructure, energy supply and
human capital, simplifying the tax system, and easing access to finance, are needed.
11.
Strong political commitment is necessary in order to improve macroeconomic
management and to build buffers to ensure policy consistency. While The Gambia has
benefitted from significant levels of technical assistance, the political commitment to continued
sound macroeconomic policies has been noticeably lacking. In the absence of such reforms it will be
difficult for The Gambia to durably break from the stop-go nature of its growth experience.

Safeguards assessments
Safeguards assessments of the Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG) were completed in February 2004,
February 2007, November 2009, and July 2012. The 2012 update report concluded that the CBG
governance has strengthened since the 2009 assessment. The recent assessment stressed that
continued and effective oversight by both the Board and the Audit Committee will be important to
ensure that key areas of CBG operations such as transactions with the government, controls around
IT systems, and compilation of program data are adequately monitored to mitigate heightened risk.
The CBG is facing capacity issues in accounting and internal audit that need to be addressed in the
near term. Future amendment of the CBG Law would provide the opportunity to strengthen CBG
autonomy by the incorporation of safeguards recommendations in this area.
Exchange rate arrangement
Until January 20, 1986, the Gambian currency, the dalasi, was pegged to the pound sterling at a rate
of D5 = £1. On January 20, 1986, an interbank market for foreign exchange was introduced, and
since then the exchange rate has been determined by market forces. Effective February 2, 2009, the
classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from managed floating
with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to
the revision of the classification methodology. The Gambia has accepted the obligations of Article
VIII, Sections 2(a), 3 and 4 and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions, except for restrictions maintained
solely for the preservationof national or international security, which have been notified to the Fund
in accordance with the procedures set forth in Executive Board decision 144-(52/51). However, since
end-2012, a series of presidential directives imposing fixed, overly appreciated exchange rates were
issued during October 22-November 15, 2012; June 26-July 15, 2013; July 26-October 9 and more
recently, on May 4th 2015 to date. The end-June 2015 midpoint exchange rate in the interbank
market was D39.72 per U.S. dollar compared to about D51 per U.S. dollar reached prior to the
directive. The 2012 and 2013 directives have since been rescinded. LEG in consultation with MCM is
assessing if the fifth directive gives rise to exchange restrictions or multiple currency practices in
breach of The Gambia’s obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3.
Last Article IV consultation
The Executive Board concluded the 2013 Article IV consultation (SM/13/289) on September 11,
2013.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
The Gambia—Statistical Issues Appendix
As of July 14, 2015
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data have serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance but efforts are underway

to improve statistics. The most affected areas are balance of payments, national accounts, and external
debt statistics.

National Accounts (NA): The Gambia Bureau of Statistics (GBoS) has disseminated in March 2015 a set of

annual GDP estimates—by activity and by expenditure approaches for 2004-2013 based on the 2006
Economic Census with 2004 as benchmark year. Although data issues, including shortage/inadequate
survey coverage and poor quality of external sector data, still affect the quality and accuracy of these
estimates, the IMF October 2014 and March 2015 TA missions believe that the annual processing systems
are as good as they are going to be until updated data, principally the new Economic Census results are
available to derive a new set of annual GDP estimates. In this regard, GBoS, aided by TA, has made
significant progress in conducting an establishment survey for updating the business register. The first
phase of the survey is now complete paving way for the actual economic census to take place. The
Integrated Household Survey (IHS) under preparation will also be used for the new benchmark estimates
of Household Final Consumption Expenditure (HFCE).
Other issues of concern are the timeliness of GDP figures compilation and dissemination. The
government increased the budget allocations for GBoS in 2013 which enabled the recruitment and
training of more staff. However, GBoS still faces capacity and financial constraints to process data in a
timely manner. Collaboration between NA stakeholders has improved somewhat and line ministries will
continue to contribute to the development of sectoral statistics, particularly in agriculture, health,
education, transport, and construction.
Price Statistics: The current CPI with a weight reference period of 2004 was introduced in January 2007

and has a weight reference period of 2004. The GBoS had a target to rebase the CPI using the results of
the 2010 integrated household survey and to release the rebased by January 2015. This target was
missed with the rebased CPI now scheduled to be released from January 2016 onward. In addition to
rebasing, GBoS is also revising its methodology for calculation of CPI elementary aggregates. Once
completed, these changes are expected to improve the CPI compilation significantly and to make CPI
movements more reflective of the underlying price movements.
Government Finance Statistics: The authorities release data on central government transactions with a

lag of about four weeks for both revenues and expenditures. With the introduction of the IFMIS in 2010,
the compilation of expenditure data by functional category and by administration is now possible.
However, the authorities have not yet started to make them available to the public at regular intervals,
contrary to best practices. The compilation of project grant disbursements and project grant use has

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE GAMBIA

been a challenge, leading to financing discrepancies. Monthly data on domestic government financing
are available with a delay of about four weeks.
The Gambia has suspended reporting GFS data to the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook from the
fiscal year 2010 onwards.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: The Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG) has improved data reporting to

the Fund. In June 2012, the CBG completed migration to the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs) for the
submission of its monetary and financial statistics (MFS) to the Fund.
Additionally, in June 2012, the CBG launched an electronic reporting system for commercial banks which
will facilitate the accurate and timely submission of relevant information for supervision. In early 2013, the
CBG started the collection of new data, including those on term structure of commercial banks’ assets
and liabilities. One major limitation is that the validation of electronic returns is manual since the
electronic system does not contain algorithms to validate data automatically. In addition, the deadline for
the official roll out of the new system has been postponed several times due to connectivity problems of
some banks.
Despite this progress, MFS data are still in need of improvements in terms of financial institution
coverage. The depository corporation survey does not include data from non-bank deposit taking
institutions, a growing sector in the country.
In February 2015, an STA technical assistance mission on financial soundness indicators (FSIs) visited the
CBG to assist with regular compilation and reporting of the FSIs. The work is ongoing and is foreseen to
be completed by 2015Q3. As in the case of MFS, FSI data will be subject to some limitations, particularly
concerning coverage and availability of balance sheet breakdowns.
Financial sector surveillance: Data quality has improved significantly following the introduction of an

automated platform for regulatory returns. This paved the way for the recent implementation of
comprehensive stress tests for the first time. However, cross border exposure data for financial
corporations are not available.
External sector statistics: Despite some improvements, balance of payments statistics continue to be

affected by serious shortcomings. These include delays in the collection of trade, customs, and tourist
arrival data; outdated methods for estimating the re-export trade; poor data on capital flows; lack of a
register of firms and establishments engaged in external transactions; poor classification of balance of
payments data; and lack of a consistent methodology. Institutional weaknesses have also been a major
impediment to improving statistics. Official grant and loan disbursements and repayments are generally
well recorded, but there are some gaps in project disbursements. Due to the various data shortcomings,
there is a large discrepancy between the BOP data reported by the authorities to STA and the adjusted
data used by AFR. For example, data reported by the authorities to STA point to a small current account
surplus (except in 2012), while adjusted AFR data indicate that the country is running a large current
account deficit.
The CBG produces balance of payments statistics according to the Balance of Payments Manual, 5th
edition (BPM5). The CBG has been compiling quarterly balance of payments statistics through a Fund-

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

THE GAMBIA

administered technical assistance project funded by DfID. The most recent data available are for the third
quarter of 2013. An IIP statement in the standard format has not yet been prepared but this remains a
primary goal (for the period 2008-2013), following the last TA mission (February 2015).
To improve the quality of BOP statistics, the CBG conducted surveys of tourism expenditures and reexports in 2011, and surveys of FDI and trade credits and advances in 2012. GBoS, CBG, and the Gambian
Revenue Authorities (GRA) have been holding regular quarterly meetings on re-exports, in order to
standardize procedures and reports for border stations. CBG also plans to rebuild staffing levels and
continuously build up capacity in the BOP unit at the Economic Research Department, in line with
recommendations from the DfID-funded STA TA mission held in early 2013.
II. Data Standards and Quality

Participant in the Fund’s General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) since 2003.
Metadata and GDDS improvement plans have not
been updated since 2007, except for the balance of
payments and gross official reserves which were
updated in 2011.

A data ROSC was published on December 1, 2005.

III. Reporting to STA
The authorities provide some financial soundness indicators (FSIs) to the IMF database; however, not all
core FSIs are reported and the reported indicators are not timely.
No data are being reported for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook or in the
International Financial Statistics (IFS).
Since June 2012, monthly SRF-based monetary statistics have been reported to STA for publication in IFS.
Balance of payments statistics are submitted for publication in the IFS and in the Balance of Payments
Statistics Yearbook since 2005..

Statement by Ms. Chileshe Mpundu Kapwepwe, Executive Director for The Gambia
and by Ms. Gillian Nkhata, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
September 18, 2015
On behalf of the Gambian authorities, we thank staff for the frank and constructive policy
dialogue during this particularly challenging consultation cycle. The mission team and the
IMF’s resident representative in The Gambia made commendable efforts to engage with the
authorities, development partners and other stakeholders, which has greatly helped to inform
the policy agenda going forward. The authorities appreciate the continuing engagement with
the Fund and broadly agree with staff’s assessment of the economy, although with a more
optimistic view of the outlook. We also thank Executive Directors and Management for their
continued support and guidance. My Gambian authorities have conveyed their continued
commitment to strong macroeconomic management, as well as to restoring macroeconomic
stability and promoting inclusive growth.
Recent economic developments and outlook
Although The Gambia has remained Ebola free, the economy is still facing urgent balance of
payments needs, triggered mostly by the impact of the regional outbreak on tourism, which
contributes around 20 percent of GDP. The outbreak is estimated to have cut tourism receipts
by more than half for the 2014/15 season. The overall impact of the shocks on the balance of
payments during 2014/15 was estimated to be $40 million (over 5 percent of GDP in 2015,
even taking into account the positive impact of lower global fuel prices). Gross international
reserves have declined to cover less than two months of imports, from almost 5 months of
imports at end-2013. In addition, the delayed rains in 2014 have led to a 15 percent decline in
the year’s crop, pushing down real GDP and threatening food security. Nevertheless,
according to the Gambia Bureau of Statistics, real GDP grew by 1.6 percent in 2014, an
upward revision from the estimated 1.4 percent contraction.
Going forward, however, growth is expected to return to trend in the medium term, and could
exceed 5 percent already in 2016, with strong policy implementation and the projected
rebound in agricultural output and tourism, which together account for 40 percent of GDP.
We note, in particular, that agricultural production is estimated to have declined by
8.4 percent, which is less severe than the 22.7 percent decline previously reported. Regarding
the tourism sector, economic recovery in the EU, the low incidence of new Ebola cases in the
region, and marketing and investment efforts in the sector should bolster performance. With
the recovery in these two sectors, we expect the external current account deficit to narrow in
the medium term. Gross international reserves would also be restored, while inflation could
be expected to return to the targeted 5 percent, given the currently subdued international
prices for food and fuel.

2
Performance under the Staff Monitored Program
As Executive Directors recall, The Gambia’s program under the Extended Credit Facility
(ECF) was pushed off track and cancelled earlier this year. On April 2, the Board approved a
disbursement of US$10.8 million under the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF), which was intended
to support the authorities’ own adjustment efforts, and catalyze donor financing. The RCF
disbursement was supported by a one-year SMP, under which my authorities committed to
lowering net domestic borrowing (NDB) to 1 percent of GDP in 2015 from 12¼ percent in
2014. This would bring interest payments down, and create space to move to a more
sustainable fiscal path. In addition, the authorities resolved to take steps to tackle the
financial problems of key public enterprises and to secure their medium-term fiscal
consolidation and poverty reduction objectives. About US$22 million was expected in
external budget support.
My Gambian authorities believe that the Staff Monitored Program has been helpful in
enhancing the implementation of the authorities’ planned fiscal adjustment measures and the
government’s Program for Accelerated Growth and Employment (PAGE). Initially, the
authorities were confident that they could maintain policy implementation in line with the
main commitments under the program. However, there were some spending pressures in the
face of the growing impact of the Ebola crisis, and except for the health sector support grant
of $5 million from the World Bank, donor financing, including the expected budget support
has not been forthcoming. Earlier in December 2014, the European Union (EU) announced
that it was stopping around $16 million in development aid, based on non-program related
issues.
Macroeconomic policies
Fiscal policy
Despite recent challenges, my Gambian authorities remain committed to fiscal consolidation.
Over the past few years, they have demonstrated this by taking some sensitive measures,
including adjusting fuel prices to eliminate subsidies, bringing utility tariffs closer to cost
recovery level and continuing to make efforts to strengthen revenue collection and
administration. Efforts in mobilizing revenue, in particular the introduction of the value
added tax, have helped raise the revenue to GDP ratio from 16 percent in 2012 to
18 ¾ percent in 2014. The authorities have also been working to secure medium-to long-term
fiscal sustainability, in particular to reduce the fiscal burden arising from financial difficulties
in the key public enterprises. Noteworthy steps have been made to address the financial
problems of the National Water and Electricity Company (NAWEC) and other public
enterprises, especially GAMTEL and GAMCEL. The authorities are also undertaking efforts
to switch spending toward strategic priority infrastructure and social sector projects.
Accordingly, they have launched actions to restrict nonessential travel of civil servants, cut
down on foreign missions, and introduce a comprehensive government vehicle policy.

3
The government remains steadfast in the implementation of expenditure measures outlined in
the SMP to shore up the NDB target in 2015. In particular, executive approval has been
secured to articulate these measures and develop a strategy for their implementation. On the
proposed sale of government-owned land plots, an evaluator has been contracted to
determine the value of the plots to be sold. Once the evaluation is complete, the land sales
will begin in earnest. In addition, the government has helped NAWEC secure a second
ECOWAS grant disbursement, which should help strengthen NAWEC’s financial position.
The authorities are also developing a framework on the implementation of GMD 10 levy on
each bill issued by NAWEC to buttress its cash flow.
The authorities are about to submit a paper to cabinet for consideration and approval on
streamlining membership to non-financial international organizations. Once the proposal is
approved by the cabinet, implementation will start. Furthermore, besides the downsizing of
diplomatic missions, government has established a taskforce to review Foreign Service
Regulations, with a view to minimizing staff-related costs. The authorities intend to seek
approval on the new regulations for implementation at the start of 2016.
My Gambian authorities recognize the need to press on with the implementation of agreed
measures identified in the MEFP and the 2015 budget, and to implement contingency
measures in addition to those stipulated in the budget. They are also aware of the need to
garner more support from the donor community to shore up external budget support. In this
regard, discussions are underway with some nontraditional bilateral partners. The authorities
are also considering measures to achieve deeper budget restructuring. Further measures under
consideration, such as civil service reform, will require garnering further political support
and caution before implementation. The authorities also recognize the importance of reform
in the energy and telecommunications sectors.
The authorities have also engaged the World Bank to support the civil service reform
program and the Bank has expressed interest in it. Work has commenced on the Project
Design, and it is hoped that this would be concluded soon. The authorities are currently
developing a strategy on streamlining and reducing the number of government ministries and
agencies, with a view to ultimately reducing the size of the public sector. Once finalized, a
concept note will be submitted to the Executive for approval.
Public debt management
The authorities are also taking steps to improve public debt management. In particular, the
relevant departments of the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of the Gambia (CBG)
coordinate regularly on both domestic and external debt to improve information exchange,
which will lead to better forecasting of interest payments. The Ministry is also compiling a
database on debt and contingent liabilities of SOEs.

4
Monetary policy and exchange rate policies
The CBG has steadfastly deployed available instruments to control inflationary pressures,
managing to contain inflation has within the single digits at around 6.5–7.5 percent since late
2014. In May, the CBG raised the policy rate by one percentage point to 23 percent. In
addition, the CBG has continued efforts to improve liquidity management and forecasting,
including by strengthening its collaboration with the fiscal authorities.
The authorities recognized that the flexible exchange rate regime has served the country well
and enhanced competitiveness over the years. The CBG was able to build-up reserves to five
months of import cover. However, due to speculative activities in the domestic foreign
exchange market, an Executive Directive was issued fixing the exchange rate with the
US dollar at a level estimated to be 30 percent higher than the prevailing market rates. This is
believed to be a temporary measure. Staff stresses the need to rescind the recent exchange
rate directive and to return to a flexible exchange rate policy. The CBG has continued to
maintain a tight monetary policy stance by maintaining high reserve required reserve ratio
and has continued to tighten the foreign exchange net open positions of banks to increase the
supply of foreign exchange. The CBG stands ready to tighten policy further should
indications of exchange rate over-shooting emerge upon lifting of the Executive Directive.
The authorities are emphasizing the need to proceed with caution, carefully assessing the
policy implications of any alternatives, to avoid policy reversals that, in themselves might be
destabilizing. They cannot act on the staff’s recommendations without securing a consensus
among the authorities on the assessment of macroeconomic risks.
Financial sector policy
As indicated in the staff report, the banking sector has continued to be sound and resilient,
and it appears able to cope with increases in NPLs, although credit concentration risks have
increased with the fiscal instability. Market risks are manageable for both interest and
exchange rate risks, although prolonged high interest rates have been damaging to the private
sector and SOEs. There has been strong asset growth and increased competition in deposit
mobilization. In addition, solvency remains strong and all banks remain within the capital
adequacy ratio prudential limit.
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
Commercial banks have been complying with the Directive issued by the CBG to submit
their audited accounts in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. This
was meant to enhance the quality of financial reporting. It followed a series of training
programs for both CBG and commercial bank staff to enhance their knowledge on the
reporting standards. Further, an electronic data submission system, the V-RegCoss, which
was designed to further enhance the accuracy and transparency of reporting of commercial
banks to the CBG, is functioning smoothly.

5
Financial Intelligence Unit
The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) started operating as an independent entity with the
appointment of a new Director. The Unit, which was temporarily housed in the CBG of the
Gambia, has now secured a new office with adequate funding and staffing to enable it to
effectively carry out its mandate. The staff also took part in series of training and capacity
building programs while the national AML/CFT strategy, action and implementation plan has
been finalized in a bid to enhance efforts in combating money laundering and terrorist.
National Crisis Resolution Framework
The CBG is in the process of establishing a National Crisis Resolution Framework. A
taskforce has been setup to conduct research on the design of the framework. The taskforce
has completed and submitted its findings to the management of the Bank for review. The
development of the Crisis Management and Resolution Framework (CMRF) was prompted
by the decision of the Committee of Governors of the West African Monetary Zone
(WAMZ) at its Convergence Meeting held on July 16, 2014. The decision provided that the
College of Supervisors of the Zone should develop a harmonized framework for financial
resolution in the sub-region. Each country would provide a draft crisis resolution framework,
which would highlight any operational, legal and other challenges and/or impediments,
including solutions towards integration into one broad resolution regime. All the frameworks
would then be merged into a harmonized framework for the sub-region.
My authorities are aware of the heightened risks at this current juncture. They have thus
intensified efforts on structural reforms to guarantee financial stability, including developing
a national crisis resolution framework as outlined above, which will be extended to cross
border in the sub-region. Plans are also underway to strengthen supervision, by migrating
from a hybrid (compliance and risk-based) to a fully risk-based supervisory framework, once
the architecture to implement risk-based supervision is completed. The CBG will continue to
conduct top-down stress testing using simple sensitivity-based models to assess the resilience
of the banking system to various shocks.
Inclusive growth and competitiveness
The Gambian authorities’ efforts to promote inclusive growth over the past few years are
bearing fruit. As noted in the staff report, child and maternal health indicators have
improved, as have those in education, and youth and female literacy. Nevertheless, poverty
remains a concern and recent economic challenges have constrained the achievement of
inclusive growth objectives. The authorities recognize the need to step up efforts to improve
competitiveness, which will help boost inclusive growth. They have thus embarked on a
number of projects to scale up investments in energy and transportation, including the Trans
Gambia River bridge construction and a project to connect the regional hydropower grid.

6
The authorities recognize the vulnerability of the agricultural sector to drought and its overall
impact on economic activity. As a result, the Government has identified some measures to
mitigate the risks of drought on agriculture. Recently, the authorities signed a Drought
Insurance Policy with the Africa Risk Capacity (ARC). Under this arrangement, resources
would be made available immediately in the event of a drought to dampen the impact on
economic activity. The government has also signed an agreement with the Islamic
Development Bank, with the Drought Resilient Project also geared toward tackling droughtrelated shocks.
Conclusion
In closing, I would reiterate the strong appreciation of The Gambian authorities for the
continuing support from the Fund. They have expressed their strong commitment to sound
macroeconomic management and inclusive growth, which they recognize needs to be
underpinned by solid public financial management. The authorities intend to continue
pursuing policy efforts towards narrowing the budget deficit as a key foundation in efforts to
reduce the debt burden and related interest payments. They are also committed to deepening
structural reforms to boost competitiveness, promote inclusive growth and accelerate poverty
reduction.
