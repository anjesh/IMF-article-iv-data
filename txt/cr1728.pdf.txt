IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Uruguay
On January 9, 2017, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Uruguay, and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal
without a meeting.2
Uruguay is demonstrating resilience in the face of recessions in its large neighbors. The
economic slowdown has bottomed out in 2016 and there are signs that the economy is on an
incipient recovery path. Real growth is estimated at 1.2 percent in 2016 and projected to reach
1.4 percent in 2017, as the external environment strengthens, together with private consumption.
The peso appreciated against the U.S. dollar between April and October 2016, but depreciation
pressures reemerged in November, following the U.S. elections. The current account deficit is
expected to remain around 2¼ percent of GDP in 2016, and would edge up to 2½ percent in the
medium-term as domestic demand recovers.
Despite the slowdown in activity, inflation remains at levels above the central bank’s target
range. Inflation is projected to slow and remain well below 9 percent in 2017, tapering to about
6 percent in the medium-term as the output gap gradually closes. Monetary policy remains
relatively tight but its transmission has been constrained by the high dollarization and low level
of peso credit in Uruguay.
Fiscal policy has remained broadly neutral in 2016 and the public sector deficit is estimated at
3.8 percent of GDP in 2016. In line with the government’s objective to reach a 2.5 percent
deficit by 2019, parliament has approved tax increases and expenditure cuts for 2017.
Risks to the outlook are both external and domestic, but tempered by Uruguay’s strong liquidity
buffers and flexible exchange rate. A slower than expected recovery in Argentina and Brazil,
and weak growth in China would weigh on Uruguay’s economy, while a tightening in global
financial conditions could raise the cost of financing. Furthermore, given limited space for

countercyclical policies, slower than expected growth in 2017 would accentuate the tradeoff
between the authorities’ announced fiscal consolidation plans and avoiding an overly procyclical stance that would exacerbate the slowdown. Nonetheless, Uruguay’s strong liquidity
buffers, high level of gross reserves, and flexible exchange rate regime would put the country in
good stead to weather such shocks.
Financial stability risks are limited. Non-performing loans remain relatively low, at 3.5 percent
of total loans, while provisions are high.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2016 Article IV consultation with Uruguay, Executive Directors endorsed
staff’s appraisal, as follows:
Uruguay is managing the deep recession in its large neighbors relatively well. After a marked
slowdown, growth started to recover in the third quarter of 2016. Investment and consumption
bottomed out through mid-2016, as inflation stabilized and the exchange rate stopped
depreciating. The current account deficit has been cut in half since 2014, and international
reserves have stabilized well above prudential norms. The real effective exchange rate appears
aligned with fundamentals and desirable policy settings.
The external environment continues to present risks. Continued weakness in Argentina and
Brazil, and a slowdown in global demand would adversely affect exports, while higher interest
rates would raise funding costs and capital flow volatility would complicate the conduct of
monetary policy. Uruguay’s flexible exchange rate and strong liquidity buffers would, however,
support an orderly adjustment to shocks.
The authorities have demonstrated a clear commitment to putting the public finances on a
sustainable track. The widening of the fiscal deficit in 2016 was a helpful response to moderate
the sharper-than-expected slowdown. At the same time, the government has locked in tax
increases for 2017, sustaining its commitment to bring the fiscal deficit to 2.5 percent of GDP by
2019 which is projected to put debt on a downward trajectory. The fiscal consolidation effort is
essential to safeguard Uruguay’s hard-won credibility with international investors and face the
long-term fiscal challenges of population aging. Automatic fiscal stabilizers should be allowed to
operate along the structural consolidation path. The long-term credibility and countercyclicality
of fiscal policy could also be enhanced through a well-designed and stronger fiscal anchor.
Future policies should protect the announced infrastructure investment increase. Public
investment significantly decreased in 2015, and public-private partnerships are taking off slowly,
whereas there is a clear need for infrastructure upgrades, in particular in transportation. Further
improvements in the profitability of public enterprises and efforts to contain current public
spending can create room for capital spending.

3
Lower inflation is a prerequisite for reducing dollarization. The high dollarization of deposits
constrains the provision of peso credit and the effectiveness of monetary policy, and calls for
higher scrutiny of banks’ credit risk exposures. A commitment to low inflation, supported by
regulatory incentives such as reserve requirements differentiated by currency and initiatives to
deepen local currency capital markets, can encourage a gradual de-dollarization of the economy.
A tight monetary policy will be needed to help guide inflation toward the target range. Inflation
has continuously surpassed the central bank’s target range for the past 6 years, temporarily
exceeding single digit levels in mid-2016. The stance of monetary policy should be tightened
further if and when activity recovers during 2017, to help sustain the disinflation process.
A further reduction in inflation persistence, through the wage-setting process, will also be
important. In this context, the ongoing move to wage increases that are stipulated in nominal
terms is most helpful. Looking ahead, inflation inertia should be lowered further through steps
toward the full elimination of backward inflation indexation.
Structural reforms in education and trade liberalization would help to deepen the social gains of
the past decade and boost potential growth. Efforts to promote free trade within Mercosur, as
well as to ensure market access to third countries are welcome. Education reform is also
necessary to develop the skills that will strengthen Uruguay’s competitiveness in international
markets.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
December 21, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context. Prudent macroeconomic policies, strong institutions, and a commitment to
diversify its markets and products have allowed Uruguay to show resilience in the face
of sharp recessions in its large neighbors. Nevertheless, economic growth slowed down
in 2015 and 2016 while inflation remains above target. In 2017, an improving regional
environment is expected to contribute to a modest further recovery, while inflation
should slowly converge towards the target range. Given rising debt and high inflation,
the room for more expansionary fiscal or monetary policy is limited.
Main Policy Advice


The fiscal consolidation package for 2017 will support the downward trajectory of
net debt and underpin Uruguay’s hard-won credibility with international investors.
The package should be implemented in a manner that supports the nascent
recovery, including by allowing automatic stabilizers to work and by supporting
infrastructure investment.



Over the medium term, stronger fiscal anchors could enhance the credibility of
public finances, expanding the scope for counter-cyclical fiscal policy.



Tight monetary conditions are important to support the disinflation effort. High
dollarization currently saps monetary policy transmission, and de-dollarization will
require progress in reducing inflation and deepening domestic currency capital
markets. Steps to reduce wage indexation further could bolster the disinflation
process.



The flexible exchange rate remains key for absorbing external shocks.



Key policies to guarantee continued sustainable and inclusive growth also include
education reform, and further international integration.

Past advice. In recent Article IV consultations, there has been broad agreement
between the authorities and Fund staff on the macroeconomic policy objectives. The
authorities have sought to tackle inflation by reducing wage-price inertia in line with
staff advice, and have generally maintained a tight monetary policy stance. The fiscal
consolidation package follows long-standing staff advice to reverse the rise in public
debt over the medium term. Broadly in line with staff recommendations on the
importance of exchange rate flexibility, the authorities have allowed the exchange rate
to adjust, albeit with some interventions to smooth movements in both directions.

to safeguard and advance the socioeconomic
gains of the past decade, including reduced
poverty and inequality, it will be critical for Uruguay to invest in structural reforms that enhance its
growth potential and to reinforce its record of macroeconomic stability, creating space for
countercyclical policies over the medium term.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
2.
The economic slowdown has bottomed out in 2016 and there are signs that the
economy is on an incipient recovery path. Following a decade of expansion, growth came to a
near halt in the final quarter of 2015 and first half of 2016, on the back of a difficult environment in
the immediate region. The downturn involved a decline in exports, a sharp decline in private and
public investment throughout 2015, and continued weak consumption (as rising inflation and
exchange rate depreciation eroded current and expected real wages, and regional problems
undermined confidence further). The downturn was especially pronounced in manufacturing and
construction, while severe floods disrupted agricultural production in April. On the other hand,
electricity generation expanded strongly as renewable energy projects came on stream. Confidence
and activity rebounded in the third-quarter, buoyed by an appreciating exchange rate and prospects
of improvements in Argentina and Brazil. Unemployment peaked at 8.8 percent in July 2016—the
highest level since 2008—before trending down, and a negative output gap has opened up,
estimated at ½ percent.
3.
After weakening further against the U.S. dollar in nominal terms in early 2016, the
Uruguayan peso stabilized and reversed course from April through October, broadly in line
with regional peers (see Figure 1). Following a 23 percent depreciation in 2015, the peso depreciated
by 8 percent against the U.S. dollar between January and March 2016. The weakness of the currency
was driven by portfolio capital outflows, both on the asset and the liability side. From May onwards,
the currency reversed course, resulting in a 6 percent appreciation in the year through October. The
real effective exchange rate depreciated 4.5 percent over the course of 2015, but appreciated by

6 percent through September 2016. Staff estimates based on the current account model of the EBA
indicate that the REER remains in line with fundamentals and desirable policy settings (Annex 1).
After the U.S. elections in November, nominal depreciation pressures reemerged, and Uruguay’s
EMBI spread widened. However, they have remained relatively compressed compared to those of
regional peers.

The current account deficit is expected to remain around 2¼ percent of GDP in 2016.
The deficit in 2015 was revised down from 3.5 percent of GDP to 2.3 percent, with a lower income
balance (matched by lower FDI and other financial inflows). In 2016, the recession in Argentina and
Brazil, and low prices of beef and wheat, have yielded a

2027 and 2050, raising U.S.$1.15 billion at historically low
spreads (+205bp and +275bp respectively). In all, as of end-November, gross international reserves
had fallen by U.S.$1.8 billion during the year-to-date, but remained well above prudential norms.

5.
Despite the slowdown in activity, inflation persists at levels above the central bank’s
target range. Driven by one-off increases in administered prices, and the further depreciation at the
start of 2016, inflation rose to a high of 11 percent (y-o-y) in May, well above the 3–7 percent range
(see Box 1). The subsequent weakening of the U.S. dollar has helped bring down inflation to
8.1 percent (y-o-y) in November. With increased administrative prices, and a spike in fruit and
vegetable prices, headline inflation exceeded core inflation for the first time since early 2014.
6.
Monetary policy remains relatively tight but its transmission has been constrained by
the high dollarization and low level of peso credit in Uruguay. Against the background of rising
inflation and declining demand for peso liquidity (as the depreciation triggered further currency
substitution), the central bank tightened reserve requirements in April 2016 and lowered its
reference range for narrow money (M1+) growth. 2 This range was lowered again in July, to
1–3 percent. Short term (one month) interest rates have continued to fluctuate between 11 and
13 percent, after peaking at 15 percent in April.
1

In September, the central bank also stopped its policy of offering the repayment of maturing government securities
in U.S. dollars.
2

In April, reserve requirements were raised, leading to their equalization for peso and dollar deposits, at 28 percent,
whereas previously requirements were lower for peso deposits than for dollar deposits.

Box 1. Uruguay: Explaining the Spike in Inflation
Administered prices and exchange-rate pass-through explain most of recent spike in
inflation which peaked at 11 percent in May 2016 (y-o-y) before falling to 8.1 percent by
November.


Increases in administered prices (in particular, one-off increases for electricity and landline
telephone services) accounted for roughly half the increase from the low point in February
2015, with a spike in always volatile fruit and vegetable prices and higher tobacco prices in
early 2016 explaining the remainder. Administered prices comprise 23 percent of the CPI
basket. After a decline to almost zero percent y-o-y in early 2015, inflation in administered
prices is now similar to headline inflation again.



The recent fall in inflation to below
10 percent, on the other hand, is largely due
to the recent appreciation of the Peso
against the US dollar. 13 percent of the CPI
basket is made up of items which are (at least
partly) quoted in dollars. Recent estimates of
overall pass-through for Uruguay have been
below 10 percent (see IMF, 2016), but for
items quoted in U.S. dollars pass-through is
fast and around 30 percent.

is projected to worsen by 0.2 percentage points to
3.8 percent of GDP in 2016. The authorities have
reaffirmed their objective to reach a 2.5 percent
deficit by 2019, as announced in last year’s five-year

Box 2. Uruguay: Balance Sheet Analysis
Uruguay has a small, segmented and highly dollarized but stable financial system. Deposit
and credit dollarization (80 and 56 percent, respectively) are structurally high, with the two public
banks mainly lending to households in pesos and private banks lending to corporates in dollars
(see Lambert and Singh, 2016). Banks are highly liquid and keep their excess dollars either in
reserve deposits at the central bank or in high quality assets abroad. Furthermore, banks have
only a limited exposure to non-financial public sector (NFPS) debt whereas pension funds are the
main holders of local-currency government debt. Foreign currency debt of the NFPS (52 percent
of total) is mainly held by non-residents. Overall, the high share of equity in foreign financing
(41 percent), the large (gross) international reserves of the central bank (29 percent of GDP), the
high liquidity of the banks (liquid FX assets cover 2.5 times non-resident deposits) and the long
average maturity of NFPS debt (14 years) contribute to the stability of the system.
Pockets of vulnerability exist, however, largely due to the high level of dollarization. In
particular, the NFPS and the public sector as a whole have a (small) net short foreign currency
position. While banks’ direct FX positions are well hedged, a number of corporate borrowers have
net long FX positions, with around 30 percent of dollar lending going to non-tradable sectors.
Lastly, households have a large net long FX position due to their preference for saving in dollars,
exposing them to a peso appreciation risk. Exchange-rate pass through (notably for durable
goods and real estate) provides a natural but only partial hedge.

Financial stability risks seem limited. Staff stress tests confirm that credit and liquidity
risks remain contained, and that the banking system could withstand even a large exchange rate
shock that impaired loans to non-hedged borrowers. Non-performing loans, while historically very
low, have doubled as a share of gross loans over the past two years when the economy weakened,
but provisions for loan losses are high. After several years of decline, banks’ capital adequacy ratio
has stabilized and provides adequate loss-absorption capacity. High structural costs, including labor
costs, and recent changes in taxation however weigh on banks’ profitability. Banks’ liquidity is ample,
supported by a funding model that relies for more than 85 percent on deposits (with a diversified
depositor base), high reserve requirements, and a low level of credit.

The risks to the outlook are both external and domestic.



External risks. Although Uruguay’s regional economic ties have lessened, a slower-thanexpected recovery in Argentina and Brazil could weigh on the economy, as could weaker-thanprojected growth in China, which has become the most important destination for Uruguay’s
merchandise exports. Non-resident deposits (mostly from Argentina) have declined to about
15 percent of total deposits, making a potential rapid withdrawal manageable in light of banks’
plentiful foreign currency liquidity. A tightening in global financial conditions could raise
Uruguay’s cost of financing. The share of nonresident holdings of Uruguay’s public debt
increased in 2015, mostly because of valuation effects, and at almost 58 percent, could also pose
some external risk, although maturities are long.



Domestic risks. If the recovery in 2017 were weaker than expected, adhering to the planned
fiscal consolidation plan would risk intensifying the slowdown, while a more expansionary fiscal
stance would pose risks for debt. On the positive side, a potential large foreign investment
(about 7 percent of GDP) in a third pulp mill presents upside risk to growth.

13.
Uruguay’s strong liquidity buffers and the flexible exchange rate should enable an
orderly adjustment to shocks.


Public sector financing risks are limited by sizeable liquid financial assets (about 6 percent of
GDP) sufficient to cover debt service for 18 months, buttressed by the government’s access to
contingent credit lines at international financial institutions of 4½ percent of GDP.



The authorities’ willingness to allow the exchange rate to adjust in response to shifts in
economic fundamentals has been key to absorbing external shocks.



The BCU’s gross reserves are ample relative to standard prudential benchmarks, and stand at
140 percent of the upper bound of the ARA metric range for Uruguay, and could help cushion
severe external shocks (see Annex I).

14.
The authorities emphasized the high degree of uncertainty in the international
environment. They considered that Uruguay had managed the regional and global volatility well, as
evidenced by ongoing economic growth and the continued positive differentiation of Uruguay
relative to other emerging economies in financial markets. They noted that economic confidence
had increased in recent months, supported by the government’s fiscal adjustment package and the
fall of unemployment to its lowest level in a year in October. Looking ahead, they stressed the
prospects fro a third paper pulp mill, which would entail the largest investment in the country’s
history, as well as the positive outlook for increased investment via PPPs. In addition, Uruguay’s
strong financial buffers would support the authorities in navigating possible further shocks.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
15.
While the authorities avoided an overly contractionary policy stance in 2016, the room
for countercyclical policies is limited. The fiscal package to reduce the general government’s
deficit in 2017 is, by itself, projected to be procyclical, as output remains below potential.6 But
delaying the structural fiscal consolidation could undercut the downward trajectory of net debt,
jeopardize Uruguay’s hard-won credibility with international investors, and potentially force an even
more pro-cyclical tightening down the line. Given the weak economy and announced fiscal plans,
the current monetary policy stance seems appropriate. However, with inflation still well above the
upper-end of the target range, the authorities should stand ready to further tighten the monetary
stance in 2017 as needed to safeguard the incipient reduction in inflation.
16.
A key challenge is to solidify the economic and social achievements of the past decade.
Several key prerequisites are in place for boosting diversified and inclusive growth over the medium
term, including a trusted public sector and a high degree of social stability. In other areas, however,
more progress is needed. The government has started addressing gaps in transportation
infrastructure. Skills formation needs to be fostered through education reform. And the provision of
credit for private sector investment could be enhanced. In addition, while the current fiscal plans are
sustainable, there is less clarity beyond the government term. Longer-term anchors would
strengthen the credibility of economic policies, with positive effects on confidence, investment and
growth.

A. Implementing Fiscal Consolidation
17.
The authorities’ fiscal consolidation path would put net debt on a downward
trajectory. The government is expected to have avoided an overly pro-cyclical fiscal stance in 2016
by allowing the fiscal deficit to widen, while locking in the fiscal adjustment for 2017. This course of
action was in line with earlier staff advice, that a strong commitment to the structural adjustment
path for the primary balance would provide room for automatic fiscal stabilizers. The announced
measures are expected to have a lasting effect on the primary balance. However, as the economy
has slowed more than expected, fiscal settings have tightened more than originally expected. As
growth rebounds, staff projects the primary surplus to exceed 0.5 percent of GDP in 2019, allowing
for a gradual reduction in gross and net public debt.
18.
The focus on fiscal consolidation is appropriate, although there is some space to
respond to unanticipated shocks. Debt levels have risen sizably in recent years. As such, financial
markets are keeping a close watch on the implementation of the fiscal adjustment aimed at
ensuring fiscal sustainability. 7 Moreover, the shares of foreign-currency denominated debt and debt

This assessment is based on the change in the cyclically-adjusted fiscal balance and does not take into account

7

The inclusion of the central bank in the public accounts, including in the debt data, implies a higher level of
recorded public debt and higher financing needs. Uruguay is one of the few countries in the world using this
presentation.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

URUGUAY

held by non-residents exceed the standard benchmarks for debt profile risk indicators (Annex III).
The announced structural consolidation, reducing the overall deficit to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2019,
will help maintain strong financial buffers. Moreover, the magnitude of the planned fiscal
adjustment to stabilize and trim public debt relative to GDP appears realistic and, as fiscal credibility
is preserved, there is space to allow fiscal stabilizers to operate. Looking beyond the government
term (which runs through 2019), population aging will hit Uruguay before other countries in the
region. The annual deficit of the defined-benefit pillar of the pension system (excluding special
regimes) is projected to grow from around 0.7 percent of GDP in 2015 to more than 2 percent in
2050 and will require further reforms, including to limit the deficit of special pension regimes and
reduce the risks coming from the indexation mismatch in the balance sheet of the public insurance
company.8
19.
Improvements in the management and profitability of public companies are essential
to strengthening the fiscal balance. Given the extensive role of public enterprises in Uruguay,
improvements in their management and coordination are vital. The recent recapitalization of the
state-owned oil distribution company, ANCAP, has strengthened its liquidity position. The
government has contracted a hedge to limit the financial risk from a large oil price increase in world
markets. The scope for passing through such increases into (administered) domestic fuel prices may
be constrained in the near term, given the limited pass through of the prior decline in oil prices,
which supports the restoration of ANCAP’s financial soundness. However, staff advised that, it would
be useful to allow retail fuel prices to fully adjust with international oil prices as soon as feasible.
Basing this on a transparent formula, would remove the risks to the budget inherent to the
stabilization of domestic fuel prices and promote efficient fuel usage. Consideration could be given
to implementing such an approach once the current oil price hedges expire to continue to ward off
a re-emergence of quasi-fiscal risks.
20.
Fiscal adjustment should be implemented in a manner that fosters economic growth as
much as possible, which hinges on the execution of planned infrastructure investment. The
2017 tax package is expected to have a limited adverse effect on consumption, with an increase in
personal income tax rates for middle-to-high-income earners, partly offset by lower VAT rates for
electronic payments. On the expenditure side, a rationalization of the public wage bill and public
enterprises’ expenditures will be important to ensure a durable consolidation, and would create
space for higher multiplier spending on public investment. In particular, regional comparisons of
infrastructure quality show a clear need for transportation infrastructure upgrades. Yet, while as part
of the fiscal adjustment, public investment was lowered by 0.9 percent of GDP in 2015, PPPs are only
slowly taking off. The recent creation of a U.S.$ 350 million fund for infrastructure projects
represents a promising step toward mobilizing financial resources for PPPs. According to the
budget, between a fourth and a third of road and railroad infrastructure projects for the period

2015–19 are to be financed through PPPs. PPPs can alleviate the initial cost of investment to the
budget, but will require effective monitoring and oversight, as well as strong control of explicit and
contingent liabilities. Beyond 2017, the authorities

advantage of low international interest rates via
successful dollar issuances and a recent interest rate swap operation (into Japanese Yen) with the
World Bank. However, the share of debt denominated in foreign currency has increased again since
2013 as demand for peso assets weakened. Building on the recently created Public Debt
Management Committee, the fiscal and monetary authorities could usefully foster the development
of a more liquid and accessible local-currency bond market which would help lower the dollarization
of public debt and further reduce external vulnerabilities. Useful steps could include the
establishment of benchmarks for long-term peso debt instruments.

22.
Stronger anchors could enhance the long-term credibility and counter-cyclicality of
fiscal policy. The current rule, which limits the annual increase in net debt, has accommodated a
strong increase in net debt during recent years.9 An overall debt limit could become part of the rule,
as a reference for determining the annual limit on the increase in net debt. This would prevent the
debt from reaching uncomfortable levels and strengthen confidence in the sustainability of
Uruguay’s public finances. Furthermore, the annual limits on debt increases could adjust to the
economic cycle, to permit the operation of fiscal stabilizers.
23.
The authorities confirmed their determination to lower the fiscal deficit to 2½ percent
of GDP by 2019 to underpin fiscal sustainability. They expected that the fiscal package for 2017
would be sufficient to reach this target, in part because of its careful design to support economic
growth. Indeed, they considered that overall fiscal policy would be supportive of growth in 2017
when taking into account all elements - the targeting of tax increases at higher income levels, the
forthcoming expansion of infrastructure investments, including through PPPs, and the positive
confidence effects of the adjustment.

B. Making Monetary Policy More Effective in Curbing Inflation
24.
Inflation is projected to decline gradually, supported by a negative output gap and the
ongoing wage discussions. The new wage agreements offer a valuable opportunity to achieve a
lasting reduction in inflation, as they are set in nominal terms, which should reduce inflation
persistence, and as they include nominal wage increases that are lower for each subsequent year,
gradually reducing cost pressures. Current projections foresee inflation moving into the 3–7 percent
target range by 2019.
25.
Nonetheless, confronting inflation remains a priority, and is a precondition for dedollarization which would support the transmission of monetary policy. Inflation in Uruguay
has remained stubbornly high and above the level in other LA-6 countries. Lower inflation would
protect the purchasing power of low-income households and increase scope to use monetary policy
as a countercyclical tool. Moreover, securing the expected gradual decline in inflation would be
especially important at this juncture, as surprise inflation could jeopardize sustained progress in
reshaping the wage regime. Successfully bringing down inflation would also promote
de-dollarization that would in turn improve the transmission of monetary policy and facilitate a
virtuous cycle of improved inflation performance. Experience in other countries shows that
incentives to internalize the risks of dollarization, the development of capital markets in local
currency, and the de-dollarization of deposits would all contribute to a decline in credit
dollarization.10 The government’s ongoing financial market initiatives (see below) can further
support progress in these directions.
26.
Bringing inflation back to within the BCU’s target range requires an appropriately
tight monetary policy. The change in the monetary policy framework in 2013––switching to an
operational reference range for M1+ growth––and the

and financial conditions. In the face of inflation well above

below estimates of the neutral interest rate (see Box 3).
Given a weak recovery and the procyclical fiscal tightening in 2017, the monetary stance remains
sufficiently supportive of the disinflation effort. However, to bolster price stability and the credibility
of monetary policy, the authorities should be ready to further tighten monetary conditions in 2017 if
and when demand pressures pick up.

Box 3. Uruguay: Estimates of the Neutral Interest Rate
The neutral real interest rate (NRIR) can be defined as the interest rate that is consistent
with a closed output gap and stable inflation. This rate is not observable and can move over
time, given changes in domestic and global macroeconomic conditions. Estimates of the neutral
interest rate provide a benchmark to assess the stance of monetary policy, the gap between the
neutral rate and the actual short-term real interest rate measuring the degree to which monetary
policy is stimulating or contracting the economy.
The estimates of the NRIR presented in this box are derived from the estimation of statespace models where the neutral rate is an unobserved state variable (see Williams and
Laubach, 2003, and Magud and Tsounta, 2012). In particular, the Kalman filter is used to estimate
a model assuming a common stochastic trend between short term and longer term nominal
interest rates (Basdevant and others, 2004)

The model estimates for the NRIR range
from 4 to 5½ percent. These levels have
exceeded actual interest rates reflecting the
persistence of inflation above the target
range. However, the results need to be
interpreted with caution since they closely
depend on the underlying model used in the
estimation. The movements in the estimates
are also influenced strongly by those of the
short-term rates.

27.

There is scope to enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy in the medium term.



Reduce inflation persistence further. New wage agreements typically include backward
indexation after 12 months or more to offset possible real wage losses. 11 While a longer
adjustment delay would be helpful in avoiding indexation in response to temporary price shocks
(as the decline in inflation is expected to be gradual and irregular), staff recommended the full
elimination of indexation provisions as expeditiously as possible.



Strengthening the policy framework. Since 2013, the monetary authorities have applied the
monetary framework in a flexible manner, repeatedly adjusting the reference range, and
allowing interest rates to rise to higher levels. However, money demand has proven difficult to
predict, and the growth rate for M1+ has undershot the reference range in eight out of the
thirteen quarters of implementation. Staff reiterated its advice to closely monitor changes in
money demand implied by the changes in deposit dollarization, in particular to avoid an unduly
relaxed policy stance. The authorities could also usefully explore options to reduce the volatility
of short-term interest rates, for example by using standing facilities to create an interest rate
corridor, as a more stable short-term yield curve could strengthen the policy signal and serve as
a reference for developing peso debt instruments and derivatives, lowering transaction costs
and enhancing market liquidity.

28.
The flexible exchange rate should remain the key mechanism to absorb external
shocks. Exchange rate movements since early 2015 helped cushion the downturn and support
competitiveness, as neighboring countries experienced similar depreciation pressures. Interventions
in the exchange market should be used parsimoniously to counter disorderly market conditions, and
not to counter trends driven by fundamentals.12
29.
The authorities emphasized that monetary policy had been kept tight, and that
inflation had declined significantly since mid-2016. In particular, they noted that across the yield
curve, real interest rates had remained strongly positive, including at short maturities. They
explained that the monetary policy tightening in the first half of the year reflected a strong response
to the rise in inflation and also responded to investors’ shift from pesos into U.S. dollars. In recent
months, the BCU had accommodated the reversal in the demand for pesos. The authorities saw the
evolution of the exchange rate as the main driver of inflation, and noted that the moderate real
wages increases embedded in the new wage agreements, combined with the partial abandon of
wage indexation on past inflation, was expected to support the decline in inflation over the coming
years. The authorities saw the increased volatility of short-term interest rates as a natural

11

Unless inflation breaches 12 percent in any given month, in which case the correction is immediate.

12

The high degree of wage-price inertia bolsters the case for countering disorderly exchange market conditions, that
feed into sustained inflationary pressures. See M. Airaudo, E.F. Buffie, and L-F Zanna, “Inflation Targeting and
Exchange Rate Management in Less Developed Countries,” IMF Working Paper 16/55 (2016) on how the combination
of currency substitution and strong effects of exchange rate changes on inflation can offer a case for interventions to
counter unwarranted exchange rate movements directly, within an inflation targeting regime.

18

URUGUAY

consequence of the change in operational framework in 2013, and stressed that the BCU was careful
to avoid stresses in the market for peso liquidity.

C. Promoting Financial Development and Maintaining Stability
30.
The ongoing steadfast implementation of the 2014 Financial Inclusion Law promises to
help increase peso deposits and competition in the peso market. In particular, the law requires
employees to choose and designate a bank account on which their wage is paid, whereas that
choice was previously made by the employer. Private banks can take advantage of the
generalization of those payroll deposit accounts and financial incentives (lower VAT) for using
electronic means of payment to increase their funding in peso. The development of the peso credit
market—supported by such peso funding—could offer new income opportunities for banks, while
the increased competition with the dominant public bank would lead to greater efficiency.
31.
Market deepening and prudential policies to discourage foreign currency deposits and
loans could support de-dollarization. The financing of public infrastructure projects could be
designed to foster the development of new capital market instruments in peso, for example by
marketing part of the securities issues by dedicated investments funds or trusts to retail investors.
On the regulatory side, reinstating differentiated reserve requirements on peso and foreign-currency
deposits and introducing asymmetric liquidity requirements between peso and foreign currency
liabilities could encourage banks to favor peso deposits.13
32.
Supervision should remain alert to closely monitor banks’ exposures and contain
stability risks. This monitoring will be facilitated by the implementation of the new International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in 2017, while the implementation of Basel III will strengthen
the resilience of the system, through for instance the imposition of capital surcharges to the five
domestic systemically important banks. The creation of new saving vehicles in peso would need to
be accompanied by strong investor protection and efforts to improve financial education.
33.
The authorities expressed satisfaction with the functioning of the financial system,
advances in the supervisory framework, and the ongoing progress in financial inclusion. They
agreed that, in principle, it was helpful for reserve requirements on foreign currency deposits to
exceed those on domestic currency deposits, and saw the equalization of requirements on peso and
foreign currency deposits, that had resulted with a tightening of monetary policy, as temporary.

13

Such differentiated reserve requirements would not be intended as a capital flow management measure, but a
structural tool to limit dollarization and enhance financial stability.

D. Supporting Inclusive Growth
34.
Social policies and transfers have played a significant role in reducing poverty and
inequality. While income dispersion has decreased across Latin America over the last decade,
Uruguay stands out as the country with the largest drop in the Gini coefficient between 2009 and
2014. This reflects both government guidelines to bolster low wages, and increased redistribution
through income taxes and transfers. Recent IMF studies indicate that more equality can add to the
long term growth potential.14 However, looking ahead, further redistributive policies may be
constrained by their fiscal costs, and should also be designed with careful consideration for their
potential impact on labor supply and incentives to seek training and enter the labor market. For
example, the declining trend in the skill premium, especially between high and medium skilled
workers, might reduce incentives toward human capital development––critical for productivity and
innovation.

35.
Education reform is essential to sustain strong and inclusive growth. Despite a clearly
higher teacher-to-student ratio, education outcomes are only marginally better than regional
averages (Figure 6), leaving room for improving the efficiency of education spending. Education
reform should aim at improving PISA scores and reducing the high dependence of student
performance on socioeconomic conditions.

Sources: INE and Fund staff calculations.

37.
New free trade agreements and progress in
international integration can contribute to potential growth. As Uruguay’s export markets have
diversified—reducing the share destined for Mercosur from 55 percent in 1998 to 21 percent by
2015—and given its focus on highly regulated and protected agricultural products, ensuring
beneficial market access is critical. The recent trade agreement with Chile, which complements the
1996 agreement between Chile and Mercosur, and the conclusion of trade negotiations between
Mercosur and the European Union should benefit Uruguay’s exports. Further trade and financial
integration with countries inside and outside the Latin American region can also facilitate the
financing of critical infrastructure projects and inward investment. The creation of a national system

of competitiveness and accompanying reforms to promote an innovation-friendly business
environment, announced in 2015, could offer a useful vehicle for reform.
38.
The authorities mentioned education reform and the financial inclusion process as
priorities to support inclusive growth over the medium term. They noted the criticality of
making further progress to strengthen the education system. The authorities saw trade integration
as an important complement to the country's successful diversification of its export destinations.

STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
Uruguay is managing the deep recession in its large neighbors relatively well. After a
marked slowdown, growth started to recover in the third quarter of 2016. Investment and
consumption bottomed out through mid-2016, as inflation stabilized and the exchange rate
stopped depreciating. The current account deficit has been cut in half since 2014, and international
reserves have stabilized well above prudential norms. The real effective exchange rate appears
aligned with fundamentals and desirable policy settings.
40.
The external environment continues to present risks. Continued weakness in Argentina
and Brazil, and a slowdown in global demand would adversely affect exports, while higher interest
rates would raise funding costs and capital flow volatility would complicate the conduct of monetary
policy. Uruguay’s flexible exchange rate and strong liquidity buffers would, however, support an
orderly adjustment to shocks.
41.
The authorities have demonstrated a clear commitment to putting the public finances
on a sustainable track. The widening of the fiscal deficit in 2016 was a helpful response to
moderate the sharper-than-expected slowdown. At the same time, the government has locked in tax
increases for 2017, sustaining its commitment to bring the fiscal deficit to 2.5 percent of GDP by
2019 which is projected to put debt on a downward trajectory. The fiscal consolidation effort is
essential to safeguard Uruguay’s hard-won credibility with international investors and face the longterm fiscal challenges of population aging. Automatic fiscal stabilizers should be allowed to operate
along the structural consolidation path. The long-term credibility and countercyclicality of fiscal
policy could also be enhanced through a well-designed and stronger fiscal anchor.
42.
Future policies should protect the announced infrastructure investment increase.
Public investment significantly decreased in 2015, and public-private partnerships are taking off
slowly, whereas there is a clear need for infrastructure upgrades, in particular in transportation.
Further improvements in the profitability of public enterprises and efforts to contain current public
spending can create room for capital spending.
43.
Lower inflation is a prerequisite for reducing dollarization. The high dollarization of
deposits constrains the provision of peso credit and the effectiveness of monetary policy, and calls
for higher scrutiny of banks’ credit risk exposures. A commitment to low inflation, supported by
regulatory incentives such as reserve requirements differentiated by currency and initiatives to
deepen local currency capital markets, can encourage a gradual de-dollarization of the economy.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

URUGUAY

44.
A tight monetary policy will be needed to help guide inflation toward the target
range. Inflation has continuously surpassed the central bank’s target range for the past 6 years,
temporarily exceeding single digit levels in mid-2016. The stance of monetary policy should be
tightened further if and when activity recovers during 2017, to help sustain the disinflation process.
45.
A further reduction in inflation persistence, through the wage-setting process, will also
be important. In this context, the ongoing move to wage increases that are stipulated in nominal
terms is most helpful. Looking ahead, inflation inertia should be lowered further through steps
toward the full elimination of backward inflation indexation.
46.
Structural reforms in education and trade liberalization would help to deepen the
social gains of the past decade and boost potential growth. Efforts to promote free trade within
Mercosur, as well as to ensure market access to third countries are welcome. Education reform is
also necessary to develop the skills that will strengthen Uruguay’s competitiveness in international
markets.

FDI inflows have slowed since 2014, but continue to fully finance Uruguay’s current account
deficit, while portfolio and other financial flows turned negative in 2015 and through mid2106. Despite a late downward revision to inward FDI in 2015 (matched by a commensurate
decrease in current account income payments), inflows of 2.4 percent of GDP were sufficient to fully
finance the CAD. In the first half of 2016, despite slowing relative to 2015, FDI inflows were eight
times the amount of the CAD. On the other hand, portfolio investment flows recorded a fifth
consecutive quarter of net outflows in the second quarter of 2016, with non-resident sales of
Uruguayan assets and resident purchases of foreign assets yielding net outflows of US$ 2.9 billion in

the first half. This trend has reversed in the second half of 2016, with the Uruguayan Treasury’s
issuance of a US$ 1.2 billion global bond, and significant portfolio capital inflows putting upward
pressure on the peso. Other capital flows have been more volatile, with asset and liability outflows in
the first quarter of 2016 followed by inflows of the same in the second, as the peso stabilized and
reversed course.
After depreciating by 23 percent against the U.S. dollar in 2015, the peso fell another 8 percent in
the first three months of 2016 in conjunction with the portfolio and other capital outflows
mentioned above, and in line with the trend among emerging markets (EMs). From April onwards,
however, the currency stabilized and has reversed course, wiping out the depreciation of early 2016,
and recording a year-to-date appreciation of 6 percent as of end October. The central bank of
Uruguay intervened in the foreign exchange market to buy pesos in early 2016, and thereafter to
buy U.S. dollars, with the aim of curbing excessive volatility and disorderly market conditions in the
relatively small domestic foreign exchange market.

results from October 2016) indicated a
cyclically-adjusted current account norm of -3.6 percent of GDP, larger than the -2.1 percent of GDP
cyclically-adjusted current account deficit (CAD) estimated for 2016, suggesting a 3½ percent
undervaluation. The contribution of policy variables to the gap between the projected cyclically
adjusted CAD and the norm was minimal, with the bulk owing to an unexplained residual.1 This large
residual may partly be due to an underestimation by the model of the cyclical impact on Uruguay of
a recession in its two large neighbors, Argentina and Brazil, causing an overestimation of the
cyclically adjusted current account deficit norm. Calculations based on the EBA external stability
approach, on the other hand, suggest a 2.8 percent overvaluation, as a CAD of -1.3 percent of GDP
would be required to stabilize Uruguay’s net foreign assets to GDP ratio in the medium term, while
staff’s medium-term CAD projection currently stands at -2½ percent of GDP.
External stability risks for Uruguay remain contained. As of end-October, gross reserves had
declined by US$ 1.6 billion since the start of 2016 to US$ 13.97 billion. Despite this, reserves remain
well above the upper bound of the IMF reserve adequacy metric range, and various other prudential
benchmarks. The sum of the foreign assets of the central bank and commercial banks far exceeds

the sum of non-resident deposits and short-term
external debt, and is also sufficient to fully cover
the sum of foreign currency denominated bank
deposits (resident and non-resident) and shortterm external debt. Furthermore, gross reserves
excluding commercial banks’ reserves held at the
BCU amount to US$ 7.5 billion, still within the
adequacy range for total gross reserves. Given the
solid level of reserves, and the financing of the CAD
through relatively stable FDI inflows, external
stability risks remain contained. Finally, although
the net international investment position has
worsened since 2007–11, this has primarily been
due to an increase in FDI liabilities.

Annex II. Uruguay—Public Sector Debt Sustainability Analysis
(DSA)
Uruguay is one of very few countries to report debt figures on a consolidated basis for the whole public
sector, excluding public commercial banks but including the central bank. This broad institutional
coverage yields public gross financing needs and debt ratios that are higher than the DSA benchmarks
for higher scrutiny countries.1 Under the baseline scenario, gross debt of Uruguay’s public sector is
projected to stabilize around 64 percent of GDP in 2021. The long average maturity and favorable
currency composition of the debt, as well as the high level of liquid financial assets of the public
sector—24.8 percent of GDP at end-2015—mitigate short-term financing risks.
The gross debt of the public sector has a wide coverage. It includes:2
Central government debt, which stood at 47 percent of GDP at end-2015. The average maturity
of central government debt exceeds 14 years. Because of valuation effects and a large issuance
in U.S. dollar in October 2015, the share of local currency denominated debt decreased from
52 to 45 percent in 2015.
Central bank debt, which declined from 17 to 12 percent of GDP in 2015, as the BCU used the
proceeds of sales of reserves to reduce its debt. The debt of the central bank mostly consists of
short-term securities issued to manage liquidity. About 63 percent of central bank debt is
denominated in local currency.
Public enterprises’ debt, which stood at 4 percent of GDP at end-2015.
And the debt of local governments and other public sector entities (such as Banco de Seguros del
Estado), which represented less than one percent of GDP at end-2015.








Overall, close to 46 percent of the debt of the public sector at end-2015 was in local currency,
66 percent of which was in CPI-indexed units.
The public sector holds sizable gross financial assets (including international reserves),
amounting to 38.7 percent of GDP at end-2015. In addition, the government has access to
contingent credit lines from multilateral institutions which represented 4.4 percent of GDP in 2015.
The total financial assets of the central bank (including foreign reserve assets, at 32 percent of
GDP) reached close to 34 percent of GDP at end-2015. About 14 percentage points of GDP in
reserves were the counterpart to reserve requirements on foreign currency bank deposits.
The financial assets of the non-financial public sector amounted to 4.7 percent of GDP at end2015, most of which held in liquid instruments (e.g., securities and deposits), in line with the
government’s prefunding policy of holding enough liquid assets to cover at least 12 months of
debt service.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

URUGUAY

The net debt of the public sector, defined as gross debt minus liquid assets, stood at
39.5 percent of GDP at the end of 2015. The stock of liquid assets of the public sector is
computed as total gross public sector assets minus the reserves held by banks at the BCU against
foreign currency deposits. This stock stood at 24.8 percent of GDP at end-2015.
Baseline scenario
Despite the slowdown, the low level of real interest rates implies a negative interest rate/growth
differential in 2016, contributing to a decrease in the gross debt of the public sector. The
appreciation of the peso vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar in the second-half of 2016 is also expected to
reduce gross debt. Net debt is however projected to increase in 2016, as the central bank’s reserves
decrease and banks’ reserves at the BCU remain stable. Both gross and net debts increase again in
2017 and 2018, before stabilizing since the primary balance improves , as a result of the fiscal
adjustment. Public gross financing needs decrease in 2017 before temporarily rising again over the
medium term, as global interest rates increase and gross debt rises.
Assuming that real GDP growth, real interest rates, and other identified debt-creating flows remain
at the level projected for 2021, the debt-stabilizing primary balance is estimated at about ½ percent
of GDP, below the projected medium term level of the primary balance.
The baseline assumptions are broadly plausible. Staff forecast track record is not systematically
biased, as reflected in projection errors generally not being consistently on one side. Although
inflation forecasts have recently tended to underestimate actual inflation and growth forecasts have
been slightly optimistic in the past two years, the median forecast errors over the period 2007–15
are broadly in line with those observed in other countries. The projected fiscal adjustment is
consistent with experiences across surveillance countries.
The fan charts show limited uncertainty around the baseline. The width of the symmetric fan chart,
estimated at around 15 percent of GDP, illustrates a certain degree of confidence for equalprobability upside and downside shocks.
Alternative scenario
A “historical” scenario, assuming that the key macroeconomic variables behave as in the last decade,
yields a downward-sloping debt path, since Uruguay experienced high growth rates and exchange
rate appreciation as it recovered from the 2002 financial crisis.
Vulnerability of the financing profile
Public sector’s financing needs do not imply near-term vulnerabilities, although they exceeded the
benchmark level of 15 percent of GDP in 2015. The elevated gross public financing needs reflect
primarily the mostly short-term maturity of the central bank’s debt, which has declined sharply since
then. The share of public sector debt held by non-residents and total external financing needs are
slightly above their respective benchmarks, but refinancing risks are limited by the presence of high
liquidity buffers, including the sizable liquid financial assets of the public sector and the access to
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

URUGUAY

contingent credit lines. These considerations also apply to the assessment of external debt
sustainability (Annex IV). The share of short-term debt in total public debt increased by 2.1 percent
in 2015, in part as the result of valuation effects, but the level of short term remains very low at
5.5 percent of GDP.

exchange rate changes partially offset the valuation
effects on foreign-currency denominated debt. Fan
charts of the projected debt distribution confirm that debt dynamics are generally manageable
under statistical distributions of combined shocks. Gross public debt would remain below 72 percent
of GDP in 90 percent of the cases, while net public debt would remain below 56 percent of GDP
under the combined shock scenario previously described.

Desk Assessment
Note: The inclusion of the central bank in the public accounts implies a higher level of public debt and higher financing needs. Uruguay is one of the few countries in the world using this
presentation.

● Bottom-line assessment of fiscal space.
Fiscal space is limited beyond the operation of automatic stabilizers around the structural consolidation path.

● Discussion of initial state.
GDP growth has slowed significantly since 2014. The output gap has turned negative and is expected to reach -0.6 percent of GDP. The government avoided an overly pro-cyclical fiscal stance in
2016 by allowing the fiscal deficit to deepen, while locking in the required adjustment for 2017.

● Explanation of the fiscal space assesment.
Financing risk indicators exceed the standard benchmarks. The debt would exceed 70 percent of GDP under the combined stress scenario (see Annex II). Nonetheless, risks are mitigated by the
presence of high liquidity buffers, including sizable liquid financial assets of the public sector and the access to contingent credit lines.
The stabilization of the debt at the end of the projection period is contingent upon the full implementation of the planned fiscal adjustment.

Notes

1/The percentile rank of median forecast error relative to the distribution of median forecast errors from other MACs. Low percentile reflects a median forecast error that is relatively large
compared to other countries and may be an indication of persistent optimism in past projections.
2/ Percentage deviation of 2016 potential output in the current WEO from the value implied by Spring 2013 WEO vintage. A negative value indicates that the current estimate of 2016 potential
output is lower than the projected value in Spring 2013.
3/ From structural reform indices calculated in IMF (2015a). Distance measured as percentage deviation from frontier economy (separately for AEs and EMs), with 0 being best.
4/ 2011 PPP$ per person, from IMF (2015b). Also converted to percentage deviation from frontier economy (separately for AEs and EMDCs), with 0 being best.
5/ Public Investment Management Assessment (PIMA) from IMF (2015b). Index ranges from 0 (lowest) to 1 (highest).
6/ Corresponds to the actual value of the indicator, or, where applicable, its maximum over the projection period (5 years as per MAC DSA). For sovereign spreads the unit is basis points; for
debt levels and GFN, the unit is percentage points.
7/ Benchmarks are indicative, and correspond to those used in the MAC-DSA: below 200 (400) bps for low risk (green); between 200-600 (400-600) bps for medium risk (orange); and above 600
(600) bps for high risk (red) for EMs (AEs). The values correspond to the latest 3 month average spread and the average spread over the last 5 years.
8/ For EMs only. Benchmarks are indicative, and correspond to those used in the MAC-DSA: below 20 bps for low risk (green); between 20-60 bps for medium risk (orange); and above 60 bps for
high risk (red).
9/ Benchmarks are indicative, and correspond to those used in the MAC-DSA: below 15 (30) bps for low risk (green); between 15-45 (30-45) bps for medium risk (orange); and above 45 (45) bps
for high risk (red) for EMs (AEs).
10/ Benchmarks are indicative, and correspond to those used in the MAC-DSA: below 0.5 (1) bps for low risk (green); between 0.5-1 (1-1.5) bps for medium risk (orange); and above 1 (1.5) bps
for high risk (red) for EMs (AEs).
11/ Benchmarks are indicative, and correspond to those used in the MAC-DSA: below 5 (17) bps for low risk (green); between 5-15 (17-25) bps for medium risk (orange); and above 15 (25) bps
for high risk (red) for EMs (AEs).
12/ Benchmarks are indicative, and correspond to those used in the MAC-DSA. For AEs, debt level/GFN benchmarks are 85/20 percent; for EMs, they are 70/15 percent of GDP. 'Green' means
debt level (GFN) remains below the benchmark in the last year before the projections and over the projection period, 'red' means the respective benchmark is breached for at least one year in
the last year before the projections or over the projection period. Value corresponds to the difference between the peak debt level (GFN) and the benchmark in percent of GDP.
13/ From IMF (2016), indicator reflects the probability that debt level exceeds the indicative debt benchmark at the end of the projection period. High risk ("red") if above 50 percent, at low risk
(“green”) if below 10 percent, and medium risk (“orange”) otherwise.
14/Results of the MAC-DSA realism module. "Green" if 3-year CAPB adjustment (3-year average CAPB level) is less than 3 (3.5) percent, "red" otherwise. Value corresponds to the percent of
countries that have achieved higher adjustment / levels of the cyclically-adjusted primary balance based on historical experience.
15/ From Vulnerability Exercise. Cyclically-adjusted primary balance needed to stabilize debt ratio in the long run (permanently after 2021), taking into account demographic trends and costs
associated with population aging. The color of the flag is based on relative rankings among G20 advanced economies and emerging markets, with adjustment needs at or below the country
group median assigned "green", those within one standard deviation higher than the mean"orange", and all others assigned a "red".

Annex IV. Uruguay—External Debt Sustainability Analysis
After averaging 46 percent of GDP during 2011–14, Uruguay’s gross external debt rose to
58 percent of GDP in 2015, mostly due to significant depreciation of the nominal exchange rate
against the U.S. dollar. In 2016, gross external debt is projected to have decreased to 54 percent of
GDP, aided by some nominal appreciation of the peso against the U.S. dollar. Under staff’s baseline
scenario, gross external debt is projected to hold steady over the medium term, rising very slightly
to 54¾ percent of GDP in 2021, largely due to exchange rate and price dynamics. Gross external
financing needs (which averaged 14 percent of GDP from 2011–15) decreased to 9 percent of GDP
in 2016, and are expected to moderate further, to 8¼ percent of GDP, in the medium term.
Stress tests indicate that the standard growth and interest rate shocks would have a minimal impact
on external debt. Shocks to the non-interest current account and a combined shock (to the real
interest rate, growth and current account) would weigh more on external debt, albeit still
moderately. Exchange rate shocks would pose the biggest risk to Uruguay’s external debt
sustainability, as shown in the charts. Nonetheless, given Uruguay’s sizeable gross international
reserves and liquidity buffers, risk to external debt sustainability remain limited.

1/ External debt includes non-resident deposits.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP
growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
3/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising
inflation (based on GDP deflator).
4/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
5/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
7/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their
levels of the last projection year.

RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of December 8, 2016)
The Inter-American Development Bank’s Board of Executive Directors approved in December
2015 the Country Strategy with Uruguay (2016-2020). Sovereign-guaranteed lending under the
program is expected to reach approximately US$1.8 billion, which is considered to be consistent
with Uruguay’s five year budget. The program includes additional non reimbursable financing for
technical assistance and analytical work. Approved lending under the previous Country Strategy
(2010-2015) reached approximately US$1.9 billion in sovereign guaranteed loans2 and US$1 billion
in non-sovereign guaranteed loans.
The objectives of the country strategy for 2016–2020 are to: (i) boost productivity and
competitiveness by promoting innovation, improving productive infrastructure, and supporting an
integrated and coordinated policy for international positioning; (ii) promote equity and social
inclusion by strengthening the human capital and employability of the population, supporting
health care reform, improving habitat, and supporting the early childhood and youth segments of
the most vulnerable population groups; and (iii) strengthen public sector management by
supporting greater efficiency in public institutions and strengthening urban and departmental
management.
As of October 31st 2016, the Bank’s portfolio in execution in Uruguay includes 37 sovereign
guaranteed loans for US$2.1 billion. Of this total, 33 are investment loan operations totaling
US$1.3 billion, and 4 are policy-based loans for US$800.8 million with a deferred drawdown option.
The main sectors comprising the active public sector portfolio are: export and investment promotion
(27%); public management and finance (16%); water, sanitation, and solid waste (14%); energy
(14%); urban development and security (8%); transportation (7%); science and technology (2%);
agribusiness (3%); education and job training (5%); and social protection (4%). The active private
sector portfolio is composed of 22 loans totaling US$449.1 million, primarily concentrated in the
energy (48%) and agribusiness sectors (46%).

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of November 15, 2016)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Most
affected area is national accounts.

National accounts: In 2009, the Uruguayan authorities completed a revision of national
accounts statistics, in which they updated the benchmark year (from 1983 to 1997 and 2005)
and adopted the System of National Accounts (SNA) 1993. However, national accounts
statistics still have some shortcomings: limited coverage of the enterprise survey, partial
update of business register, poor quality source data for some components of GDP,
inadequate information on the informal economy, and incomplete quarterly accounts.
Long-time series are not available on the BCU website. There is no regular schedule for
updating the base year of the national accounts. The causes of the current revisions to the
quarterly national accounts are not explained to users. For the national accounts there is a
need to plan adoption of the 2008 SNA and updating of the base year.
Prices: The new base period for the consumer price index is December 2010 = 100. The CPI
has national coverage and includes more than forty thousand price quotations. It does not
cover either the implicit rent or the net acquisitions of owner-occupied dwellings. For the CPI,
reselection of the sample of detailed products has not been done for an extended period. The
base of the wholesale price index has been updated to 2001. Producer price indices (March
2010 =100) for national products have been recently disseminated. The PPI does not cover
utilities, construction, business and other services and exported output. For both the CPI and
PPI, statistical outputs/intermediate results are not validated with available information from
alternative sources. The CPI and PPI would benefit from a more regular and frequent schedule
of weight updates.
Government finance statistics: Official data on the central administration, the state
enterprises and the social security system are complete and current, but there are problems
with the timeliness of the data for local governments. Information on a monthly and quarterly
basis for financing and debt data respectively, are disseminated on the BCU website from 1999
onwards for the central government and total public sector, but no information is reported for
publication in the International Financial Statistics. The information reported for publication in
the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook covers transactions on revenue and expense for
the consolidated central government (data on revenue and expense for local governments
have not been reported since 1994), and the general government’s operations on financial
assets and liabilities, both in terms of flows (financing) and stocks (debt).
Monetary and financial statistics: Monetary and financial statistics are prepared in
accordance with the IMF's Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (2000). The authorities
report monetary data for the central bank, other depository corporations, and other financial
corporations (OFCs) using the standardized reporting forms (SRFs). However, data for the
OFCs are limited to off-shore financial institutions. A mission could be fielded to expand the
institutional coverage of OFCs and compile the SRF for OFCs with full institutional coverage.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

URUGUAY

Financial sector surveillance: The authorities participate in the IMF’s Coordinated Direct
Investment Survey (CDIS), Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS), and Financial
Soundness Indicators (FSIs) databases. However, only annual FSIs data from 2009 through
2013 have been reported, and the authorities have not responded to requests for more current
data. FSIs on nonfinancial corporations, households, market liquidity, and real estate markets
are not available. The BCU disseminates FSIs for individual banks on a monthly basis and
generates FSIs for the banking system weighting individual bank FSIs by their asset share.
External sector statistics: Balance of payments and international investment position
statistics are compiled and published on a quarterly basis. Data are compiled following the
recommendations of the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. The BCU is working
on improving the quality and coverage of trade in services and direct investment-related
statistics, as well as on migration to the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and
International Investment Position Manual, Uruguay disseminates the international reserves and
foreign currency liquidity data template, submits quarterly external debt statistics to the
Quarterly External Debt Statistics (QEDS) database, and participates in the Coordinated
Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) and the Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS).
II. Data Standards and Quality
Uruguay subscribed to the SDDS in
February 2004 and is in observance.

Data ROSC published on October 1, 2001.
A data reassessment ROSC on CPI, PPI and
NA was published in February 2014.

III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
Both the consumer and wholesale price indices are reported on a regular and timely basis for
publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS). The authorities do not provide trade
price and volume indices for publication in the IFS.
Annual GFS are regularly reported to STA for publication in the Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook. No high frequency GFS are reported for publication in the International Financial
Statistics.
Uruguay reports to STA balance of payments and IIP data for publication in the IFS and the
Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook.
