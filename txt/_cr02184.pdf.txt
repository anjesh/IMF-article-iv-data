IMF Concludes 2002 Article IV Consultation with Austria
On August 7, 2002, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Austria.1
Background
After decelerating sharply in 2001, economic growth in Austria is projected to strengthen
gradually during 2002, parallel to the expected improvement in the global economic climate.
Real GDP growth is projected to average 1 percent this year, supported by a recovery in
investor confidence and strong competitiveness. Despite the recent increase, the
unemployment rate remains one of the lowest in Europe at about 4 percent. After rising to
above 2 percent in 2001, headline inflation subsided to 1.6 percent in May.
After years of policy drift, fiscal policy had targeted balancing the general government budget by
2002. The government’s 2001-02 adjustment program combined a tax package, savings on
expenditures at the federal level, and savings by the subnational levels of government. In the
event, general government balance was reached already in 2001, one year ahead of schedule,
on account of cautious budgeting on the revenue side, larger-than-expected effects from the tax
measures of the adjustment program, and strict expenditure discipline. The government intends
to stick to its fiscal adjustment plan in 2002.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares
a report, which forms the basis for discussion or review by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the
discussion or review, a summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of
the Executive Board discussion.

-2Austria’s financial sector has benefited from globalization, in particular from the expansion in
central and eastern Europe. The supervisory and prudential frameworks for the financial sector
have adapted to the new challenges, notably with the creation of a unified and independent
supervisory agency. The agency, which has responsibility for banks, insurance companies,
capital markets and pension funds, began operations on April 1, 2002.
Reforms to liberalize the economy and privatize state holdings in commercial enterprises have
been given a new momentum. The first phase of the authorities’ privatization program has been
concluded. The liberalization of the electricity and gas markets will be completed ahead of EU
deadlines, an independent competition authority has been established, and legislation has been
recently introduced which aims at streamlining regulatory and administrative requirements for
businesses.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Austria’s solid growth performance and low unemployment
and inflation. Although growth weakened considerably in 2001, conditions are in place for a
gradual strengthening of activity in the second half of 2002, due in large measure to the
authorities’ sound macroeconomic and structural policies. Directors recommended that the
authorities continue to strengthen their focus on medium- and long-term objectives, in order to
help sustain Austria’s good economic performance and cope with the challenges of population
aging and globalization.
Directors commended the progress already achieved by the authorities in imparting a greater
medium-term orientation to policy. Setting general government balance as the medium-term
fiscal objective, and implementing the adjustment measures necessary to achieve it, were
important steps to ensure sound public finances. Establishing an independent financial
supervisor—the Financial Market Authority—and revising prudential and other regulations have
modernized the supervisory framework. The renewed commitment to implement structural
reforms—demonstrated by completion of the first phase of the privatization program, advancing
deregulation of the network industries, and establishment of a new competition authority—has
laid the groundwork to enhance the economy’s fundamentals.
In light of Austria’s medium-term goal of general government budget balance over the cycle,
Directors endorsed the planned continuing fiscal retrenchment this year, noting in this
connection the outlook for the economy and the setting of supportive monetary conditions. The
authorities’ intention to implement permanent expenditure reduction measures to replace last
year’s one-off revenue measures was welcomed.
Directors stressed that it will be important to safeguard the credibility of the authorities’ fiscal
strategy. In that light, any relaxation of the fiscal stance in the coming years would be
undesirable. Noting the role of fiscal policy in stabilizing the economy, some Directors stressed
that fiscal surpluses would be in order in periods when economic activity is strong. Directors
also emphasized that the lower levels of government would also need to contribute to
adjustment—within the framework of Austria’s “internal stability pact”—and that public sector
wage restraint would be critical.

-3In light of Austria’s high tax burden, Directors endorsed the authorities’ strategic goal of
reducing the tax ratio substantially over the medium term. However, they cautioned that this
goal must not jeopardize fiscal prudence and urged the authorities to combine tax relief with
reductions of public expenditure so as not to endanger general government balance. Directors
noted that a more detailed and comprehensive medium-term fiscal policy framework—including
medium-term expenditure targets—would help ensure the consistency of multiple policy
objectives, illustrate policy tradeoffs, and increase transparency. They welcomed the authorities’
intention to adopt this approach.
Directors urged the authorities to address the particularly severe consequences of population
aging, which imply a serious threat to the sustainability of the public finances. Public awareness
of this threat remains limited, however, and preparations for dealing with it have been slow.
Pension reforms aimed at extending the period of working life and containing benefits are
needed urgently to avoid a worsening of the public pension system finances over the longer run.
Several Directors saw a case for more ambitious fiscal consolidation in this long-run context.
Directors warned against any complacency concerning demographic trends and urged timely
implementation of the necessary measures.
Directors commended the recent institutional and legislative changes that have helped
strengthen the financial sector supervisory and prudential framework—in particular, the creation
of the Financial Market Authority (FMA). The FMA should cooperate closely with the Austrian
National Bank, in order to avoid gaps in supervision and duplication. In light of the growing
cross-border linkages of the Austrian financial sector, the authorities should continue their
vigilance, and work toward closer cooperative relationships with supervisors in other countries—
particularly in Central and Eastern Europe, where foreign exposure is concentrated.
Directors noted with satisfaction that Austria is complying fully with all the recommendations of
the Financial Action Task Force. The authorities’ commitment to participate in a Financial Sector
Assessment Program at an early juncture is also welcome.
Directors encouraged the authorities to reinforce the momentum of their structural reforms.
They emphasized further privatization, deregulation and regulatory reform, and greater labor
market flexibility in order to strengthen competition and raise growth potential, in the context of
the further challenges of globalization and coming EU enlargement.
Directors welcomed Austria’s plans to raise its official development assistance to at least
0.33 percent of GNP by 2006, and encouraged the authorities to increase it further toward the
international benchmark of 0.7 percent of GNP.

Public Information Notices (PINs) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the
conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMF to the
public. This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies of member
countries by increasing the transparency of the IMF's assessment of these policies; and (ii) following
policy discussions in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board. The Staff Report for the 2002
Article IV Consultation with Austria is also available.
