STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
Focus. The 2014 Article IV Consultation focused on five broad themes to strengthen the
recovery and improve the long-term outlook: raising productivity growth and labor force
participation, confronting poverty, keeping public debt on a sustained downward path,
smoothly managing the exit from zero policy rates, and securing a safer financial system.
Main policy issues.


Policies are needed to boost longer-term potential output through investments in
infrastructure, raising educational outcomes, improving the tax structure, and
developing and expanding a skilled labor force (including through immigration
reform, job training, and providing childcare assistance for working families).



Forging agreement on a credible, medium-term consolidation plan should be a high
priority and include steps to lower the growth of health care costs, reform social
security, and increase revenues. In the absence of such a comprehensive agreement,
efforts should still focus on identifying more modest opportunities to relax the nearterm budget envelope, paid for with future fiscal savings.



An enduring consequence of the past recession has been a jump in the number of
families living in poverty. Improved employment prospects and economic growth will
be essential to reverse this upward movement. An expansion of the Earned Income
Tax Credit and an increase in the minimum wage should also be part of the solution.



The goal for monetary policy is to manage the exit from zero interest rates in a
manner that allows the economy to converge to full employment with stable prices
while avoiding financial instability and negative spillovers to the global economy. This
is a complex undertaking. To facilitate it, steps could be taken to expand the Fed’s
communications toolkit so as to provide greater clarity on how the Federal Open
Market Committee assesses progress toward its longer-run goals.



Continued regulatory oversight is needed to counter the emergence of financial
imbalances, particularly those that may be growing outside of the banking system.
Policies should also be deployed to keep mortgage credit accessible and attract more
private capital into housing finance while minimizing risks to taxpayers.



The U.S. external position is assessed to be broadly consistent with medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policies.

AN INTERMISSION IN THE RECOVERY
1.
Overview. Economic activity in the U.S. accelerated in the second half of 2013, but an
unusually harsh winter conspired with other factors—
Contribution to GDP Growth
including a still-struggling housing market, an inventory
(percent change from previous quarter)
correction, and slower external demand—causing momentum
4
Real GDP
to fade. This led to the first quarterly contraction since early
growth
2011.
2.
Housing. After a promising recovery in housing
activity for most of 2013, the past several months have seen a
retreat characterized by weaker housing starts, declining
residential investment, and subdued home sales. New
mortgage origination has been particularly sluggish as credit
availability remains constrained for lower-rated borrowers
and mortgage rates have moved up by around 70 basis
points from a year ago.
3.
Corporate investment. Business investment growth
has weakened over the last two years, held back by
uncertainty about the strength of future demand. Even after
adjusting for the lower growth rate of the labor force, capital
accumulation per worker has been disappointing throughout
the recovery, and the average age of the non-residential
capital stock is at a 40-year high.

4.
Inventories. The second half of 2013 saw a significant
build-up in inventories that was broad-based across various
industries. This over-accumulation was corrected in the first
quarter of 2014 causing the drag to growth from inventories
alone to amount to 1.7 percentage points on an annualized
basis.
5.
Net exports also weighed heavily on activity in the
first quarter of the year, detracting 1.5 percentage points of
growth (annualized). This negative contribution followed a
surge in exports in the last quarter of 2013.

6.
The growth outlook. Activity is projected to
accelerate in the remainder of this year to above
potential (in the 3–3½ percent range). Still, the drag
on growth from the first quarter contraction will not
be offset. This means growth for the year as a whole
will be a disappointing 1.7 percent. Nevertheless,
barring unforeseen shocks, growth should accelerate
in 2015 to the fastest annual pace since 2005.

Box 1. How Reversible is the Decline in U.S. Labor Force Participation? 1/
The U.S. labor force participation rate (LFPR) fell by
around 3 percentage points since 2008 and has yet
to recover. The falling LFPR is, however, not a recent
phenomenon. Labor force participation increased
sharply since the early 1960s (as the baby boom
generation reached adulthood and women became
more represented in the workforce) but then leveled
out (reaching an all-time high at 67.3 percent in
2000) and subsequently entered a secular decline
(following the 2001 recession). This downward
movement accelerated following the global financial
crisis.

LFPR dynamics are a complex combination of both structural factors (population aging or delayed
retirement) and cyclical factors (largely related to the availability of jobs). Staff’s demographic
models suggest that aging explains around 50 percent of the LFPR decline since 2007. State-level
panel regressions suggest that the cyclical effect accounts for a further 30–40 percent of the
decline.
The remainder reflects a number of forces at work. For example, the bulk of the decline in youth
participation has been driven not by an increase in college enrollment but by a decline (from 43 to
37 percent since 2007) in the number of students that are working. It is unclear how much of this
effect will be reversed as the economy improves. Regarding disability insurance, although
applications rose following the recession, acceptance rates have fallen. Despite this, disability
dynamics are still having an impact on the LFPR: even those denied benefits are likely to exit the
labor force while their application is pending and, because of aging, the share of the total
population receiving disability insurance has risen.
Overall, staff analysis suggests that up to one-third of the post-2007 decline is reversible. This
should mean, over the next 2–3 years, there will be a temporary respite in the secular decline of
the LFPR. However, after this interim period, participation rates should start declining again as the
forces of population aging begin to dominate.

Better household balance sheets. Since the crisis, total household debt has fallen steadily—albeit
with growth in student debt and a surge in auto credit—and wealth gains have been propelled
by rising house prices and a booming stock market. As a result, household net worth as a share
of disposable income has risen almost back to pre-crisis levels. It is worth noting that the gains in
net worth have been unevenly distributed with much of the improvement concentrated in the
top two deciles of the income distribution. Despite this, better balance sheets, rising consumer
confidence, and the ready availability of consumer credit should support stronger consumption
growth in the months ahead.



A healthier housing market. Household formation is expected to resume a steady path back
toward more normal levels as economic growth, more secure job prospects, and a modest
improvement in the availability of mortgage credit combine. This, in turn, will create a rising
demand for housing (both rental and owner-occupied), supporting a steady pick-up in
residential investment.



A need to upgrade the capital stock. With substantial cash holdings, low financing costs, elevated
after-tax profit margins, high rates of capacity utilization, and rising business confidence, it is
expected that corporations should begin to more assertively upgrade their aging capital stock in
the coming quarters, causing an improvement in business investment.



A dissipating fiscal drag. After an abrupt fiscal adjustment in FY2013—which indiscriminately cut
spending and led to a 1½ percent of GDP improvement in the general government primary
structural balance in CY2013—as well as the political gridlock that led to a partial government
shutdown at the beginning of FY2014, Congress finally reached a budget agreement in
December 2013. This agreement partially replaced the automatic spending cuts in fiscal years
2014 and 2015 with mandatory savings in later years and new revenues from non-tax measures.
In addition, in February, the debt limit was suspended until March 15, 2015 which helped reduce
near-term fiscal uncertainties. As a result, for this year and next, the cumulative decline in the
structural balance is projected to be relatively modest (1¼ percent of GDP). This is estimated to
dampen growth by around ¼ percentage point per year. In addition, for 2014, much of this drag
has already taken place in the first quarter (when emergency unemployment benefits and bonus
depreciation both expired). As a result, government spending is expected to add 0.1 percentage
points to growth in the remainder of 2014.



Supportive monetary and financial conditions. Since December 2013, the Fed’s Large Scale Asset
Purchase Program has been scaled back from net

rise in policy rates should mean financial conditions
will remain relatively loose for the forseeable future.

8.
Global spillovers. The expected acceleration of the U.S. economy in the coming quarters is
expected to be a positive force for world growth. Specifically, the projected increase in U.S. growth
should add 0.1–0.25 percentage points annually to (non-U.S.) global growth in 2015–16. Spillovers
will be largest to those with the strongest trade links (e.g., Canada and Mexico) but other advanced
economies and emerging markets should also benefit.

9.
The output gap and inflation. Inflation outturns remain well below the Fed’s longer-term
objective but have steadily risen over the past several months. Core personal consumption
expenditure (PCE) inflation at end-May was 1.5 percent (year on year), with headline PCE inflation
modestly higher due to rising energy costs. The rise in
Nominal Wages
(percent change, year over year)
inflation has been underpinned by increasing shelter costs
and the unwinding of the effects that the 2013 sequester

market tightness or rising wage costs. Around 4½ percent of

exhausted. As a result, the output gap is estimated at close
to 4 percent at end-2013 (and is expected to take until 2018 to close). As a consequence, PCE
inflation is forecast to be 1.6 percent at end-2014 and gradually converge (from below) to the Fed’s
longer-term objective of 2 percent. There is, however, significant uncertainty surrounding these
forecasts. If the short-term unemployment rate (which has fallen to 4.1 percent by May 2014, and is
close to pre-crisis levels) were to be a more relevant driver of wages—as some researchers have
claimed—then inflation could become more evident at an earlier stage.

10.
The external accounts. The current account deficit is expected to slowly widen as a stronger
demand for imports is only partially offset by fiscal consolidation and the improvement in the trade
balance that is linked to a rising self-sufficiency in energy. The strong performance of U.S. asset
markets and the persistent current account deficit are expected to lead to a continued worsening of
the net international investment position (from -27 to -33 percent of GDP over the next five years).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED STATES

The U.S. external position and the assessed imbalances and fiscal policy gaps have improved
considerably in recent years, with positive implications for the global economy. Despite the cyclicallyadjusted current account being somewhat on the weaker side, the U.S. external position is assessed
to be broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies (Box 2).
Box 2. External Sector Assessment 1
The current account deficit fell to 2.3 percent of GDP in 2013, continuing its descent from the

U.S. has a positive net equity position vis-à-vis the rest of the world, sizable portfolio equity and direct
investment abroad, and a negative debt position owing to sizeable foreign holdings of U.S. Treasuries

Capital and financial inflows and outflows rose in 2013 but are substantially lower than pre-2008
levels. Portfolio inflows halved in 2013, relative to 2012, but were more than offset by stronger bank
inflows. At the same time, there has been a sizable increase in U.S. overseas portfolio investments. The
U.S. dollar’s reserve currency status continues to support foreign demand for U.S. securities.

What could go wrong domestically? There continue to be important uncertainties
surrounding the baseline growth forecast (see Annex I) including whether the slowdown in growth
earlier in the year will prove to be more permanent than is currently assessed. In terms of specific
domestic risks, interest rates could rise more rapidly—either because of an unanticipated shift in the
Fed’s position, or markets unwinding the recent compression in volatility, term premia, and credit
spreads. This could instigate bouts of financial volatility with damaging implications for U.S. growth.
Alternatively, a continuation of low interest rates could foster a build-up of greater systemic financial
stability risks. The return of fiscal uncertainties in 2015—for example, linked to renewed
disagreement on the debt limit or the budget—would create downside risks. Over a longer horizon,
a delay in putting in place a credible medium-term fiscal consolidation plan has the potential to
precipitate a loss of confidence and an increase in the sovereign risk premium.
12.
Global spillovers. Given the size and importance of the U.S. economy, all of the domestic
risks described above, if realized, would have significant implications for the world economy. For
example, a rapid increase in interest rates that is not backed by stronger U.S. growth would have
negative consequences for global growth, particularly for those emerging markets with weaker
fundamentals. A one percentage point increase in the U.S. term premium could reduce growth in the
rest of the world by around 0.2 percent (see the 2014 Spillover Report). Similarly, the low-probability
but high-impact risk of U.S. bond market distress could generate a peak world output loss of 3.4–
6.0 percent (see the 2012 Spillover Report).
13.
What are the main risks from abroad? The principal external risk to the U.S. recovery
comes from a more pronounced synchronized slowdown in emerging market economies (including
in China). A one percentage point fall in emerging market growth could lower U.S. growth by
0.1 percent over a year (see the 2014 Spillover Report). If increasing geopolitical tensions
surrounding Ukraine or Iraq were to lead to global financial and trade disruptions, higher commodity
prices, and safe-haven capital flows, then the U.S. dollar would appreciate and growth could fall by
up to 0.2–0.8 percent in 2014–15, depending on the severity and longevity of the disruption.
14.
What are the upsides? Non-residential private investment growth is conservatively forecast
to be lower than predicted by staff investment models. As

Authorities’ views. The authorities believed the weak first quarter growth outturn was a
temporary aberration and partly a weather-related phenomenon. They recognized, though, that this
meant 2014 growth would likely come in somewhat below their most recent public forecasts.
However, they underlined that solid fundamentals and significant policy efforts to support the
recovery would mean that there was a strong possibility that growth could surprise on the upside in
the coming quarters. They agreed on the nature of the principal risks facing the U.S. economy but
saw a relatively remote likelihood that the downside domestic risks highlighted by staff would
materialize and were more concerned over the risks that could accompany the recent decline in
market pricing of volatility. They pointed, also, to concerns over Europe’s nascent recovery and
weaker growth in emerging markets, particularly risks emanating from China linked to either a
sharper slowdown and/or financial sector stresses. The authorities envisaged a slow rise of inflation
to the Fed’s 2 percent objective and a gradual increase in long-term interest rates to around 5
percent over the medium-term.

CONFRONTING POVERTY

“marriage penalty”, and the increase in (and refundability of) the Child Tax Credit, all of which were
introduced in 2009 and are due to expire in 2017. Such an upgrade of the EITC would have a
relatively low fiscal price tag and would directly target poverty among the working poor while
encouraging work. Complementing this with an increase in the federal minimum wage would help
ensure that part of the economic costs of raising the income of the lowest decile is borne by firms
(rather than the budget). It would also forestall the improved EITC from simply lowering the pre-tax
wage without changing the post-tax income of poor households (Box 3).
18.
Authorities’ views. The President’s 2015 Budget underscored the importance of making the
EITC a more relevant and effective instrument in tackling poverty and in encouraging people to enter
the workforce. It proposed a doubling of the childless worker EITC as well as making younger adult
workers eligible for the EITC. The Administration is also committed to increasing the minimum wage.
It has already required federal contractors to pay at least $10.10 per hour and has called on Congress
to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 for all workers. There have also been initiatives to increase the
minimum wage at the state and local levels (as of June 1, 2014, 22 states and the District of Columbia
have minimum wages above the federal minimum). Officials agreed that making progress on both
the EITC and minimum wage would be a preferred combination but also regarded passage of either
in isolation as a valuable step to ensuring that hard work pays off for all citizens and that poor
families are able to make ends meet.

COUNTERING THE DECLINE IN POTENTIAL GROWTH
19.
Pressures on labor supply and labor
productivity. U.S. potential growth is expected to level off
at around 2 percent in the coming years. This is well below
the average potential growth rate of over 3 percent seen in
the decade before the financial crisis. The main drag to
potential growth is expected to come from:


14

A slower expansion of the labor force given population
aging. Under current policies, the labor force is
expected to expand at a slow pace (of below ½ percent
per year), half the average growth rate seen in 2000–13
and well below the average (1.2 percent) growth seen
over the past 30 years.

Box 3. The Earned Income Tax Credit and the Minimum Wage—A Package
“In-work” tax credits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in
the U.S. are aimed at stimulating labor force participation and
providing income support. More than half of advanced economies
1
use such credits. In the U.S., the credit is phased out as family
income rises and also varies with the number of dependents in the
household. This generates both a “marriage penalty” (the income of
one partner can make the other ineligible for the credit) and
potentially negative effects on labor supply (since the marginal tax
rate, when adding in the loss of the EITC, can be very high for the
second earner). The complexity of eligibility for the EITC has also
been criticized for leading to high error rates and improper

Policies. Tempering the pace of decline in long-term
growth will depend critically on policies that build the (public
and private) capital stock, reverse the downswing in
productivity growth, and raise labor force participation
(Figure 2). Priorities should include:


Galvanizing infrastructure investment. The government
capital stock ratio has resumed the downward trend that
began in the 1980s. Additional investment is urgently
required to improve the quality of infrastructure,
particularly for surface transportation. Indeed, the American
Society of Civil Engineers estimates that $200 billion (about
1.1 percent of GDP) in funding is necessary to meet the U.S.
infrastructure investment needs from 2014 to 2020.
Providing clarity on future financing of the Highway Trust
Fund is a near-term priority. However, this should be viewed
only as a first step. Action is also needed to achieve a
sustained increase in both federal and state spending on
infrastructure paid for by savings in future entitlement
outlays, the raising of additional revenues, and an expansion
of infrastructure financing sources (including innovations
such as the America Fast Forward Bonds).1

A better tax system. A reform of the U.S. tax code is long overdue, as complexity and loopholes
have increased over the years. The Joint Committee on

through a reduction in exemptions and deductions. In
particular, itemized deductions for the individual income tax—including the mortgage interest
deduction—should, over time, be either capped or eliminated. On the corporate side, there is
scope to broaden the base (by cutting back on the value of various tax exclusions and
deductions), lower the marginal corporate tax rate, and change the tax treatment of
multinational corporations to limit base erosion and profit shifting. 2



Incentivizing innovation and building skills. Fiscal measures should focus on incentivizing research
and development including by reinstating and making permanent the Research and
Experimentation (R&E) tax credit that expired in December 2013. Progress can be achieved in
closing skills gaps over the near term by improving training programs conducted at the state
level, building partnerships with industry and higher education institutions for apprenticeships
and vocational training, and improving government-provided job search assistance. Over a
longer horizon, skills development will require better spending on education to raise educational
outcomes through prioritizing early childhood education (including universal pre-K) and giving
more support for science, technology, engineering, and math programs (Box 4).



Boosting labor supply and reducing long-term unemployment. In addition to expanding the EITC,
increased labor force participation could be achieved through better family benefits (including
childcare assistance) to reverse the downward trend in female labor force participation.
Moreover, the disability insurance program could be modified to provide incentives for
beneficiaries to work part-time (rather than drop out of the labor force). Potential output would
also benefit (through both labor supply and productivity effects) from reaching an agreement on
immigration reform that provides greater opportunities for high-skilled workers to work in the
United States. Finally, to accelerate the progress in lowering unemployment and to counter
stigma effects, time-bound tax credits or wage subsidies could be offered to those employers
who hire the long-term unemployed.

Box 4. Productivity Growth and Its Determinants: Evidence from the U.S. States1
Aggregate total factor productivity (TFP) growth slowed in the mid 2000s, well before the financial
crisis. Some argue that part of the decline was due to the information and technology (IT)
revolution having run its course, while others maintain that the IT revolution has still a long way to
go, and could continue to boost U.S. TFP growth in the future.2
Examining TFP growth across U.S. states suggests that the productivity slowdown is less related to
the IT cycle than is commonly thought. The change in TFP growth over 2005–10 (relative to 1996–
2004) varied from over 3 percentage points in New Mexico and South Dakota to below
1 percentage point in states like Washington, Oregon, Nebraska, Maryland, and others. However,
there is little evidence to suggest the TFP slowdown was stronger in those states that were either

decomposes TFP
dynamics into the contributions from technological progress and the improvement in efficiency.
In this framework, technological progress shifts the production frontier upward for all states, while
an improvement in technical efficiency moves each state towards the production frontier. There
appears to be a large variation in the efficiency of production across U.S. states and the empirical
work suggests that states with better human capital, higher spending on research and
development, or a more developed financial system all tend to be more efficient and closer to the
technological frontier.
Panel regressions of TFP growth across U.S. states over the last two decades seem to corroborate
these findings, showing that higher educational attainment and greater spending on R&D
(especially by the government) are linked to higher TFP growth.

Energy independence. Ongoing investments in the development of U.S. energy resources—
including those for shale oil and gas and renewables—as well as improvements in energy
efficiency have allowed domestic crude oil production to surpass net imports for the first time

of natural gas by 2018. Fully capitalizing on the benefits of increased energy independence in an
environmentally responsible way will require removing remaining export restrictions on crude oil,
building infrastructure to transport and export gas (particularly LNG), as well as providing
incentives for investment in, and use of, green energy technologies.3 The recent rule proposed by
the Environmental Protection Agency to cut emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired power plants
by as much as 30 percent by 2030, compared with 2005 levels, would provide further incentives
to upgrade plants, switch from coal to natural gas, improve energy efficiency, and promote
renewable energy.



Trade liberalization. Longer-term growth will also be helped by a further reduction of obstacles
to free trade in goods and services. The U.S. is prioritizing reaching preferential trade
agreements—including the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment
Partnership—as well as plurilateral agreements—such as the Trade in Services Agreement and
the Information Technology Agreement. To avoid fragmenting the global trading system,
progress in preferential trade agreements should be actively complemented by renewed efforts
to advance the multilateral trade agenda. The U.S. should work with trade partners to finalize by
end-2014 a work program to advance in the trade agenda at the WTO.

21.
Fiscal implications. Clearly, many of the measures
suggested above to boost long-run growth would have fiscal
implications. In particular, passage of bills authorizing
additional infrastructure spending, EITC enhancement,
increased funding for active labor market policies, and making
the R&E tax credit permanent would add about 0.3 percent of
GDP to the federal deficit over 2015–16. It should be noted
that the fiscal costs would be partly offset by better growth
resulting from these policies. Such measures should, however,
be accompanied by higher revenues and offsetting
expenditure savings in future years (see below).

Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed with many

favor policies that raise long-term growth. They particularly highlighted their efforts to raise public

pro-work tax cuts. If put in place today, the authorities believed that such policies would push
growth up to an average 3¼ percent over the next three years and achieve a potential growth rate of
2¼ percent over the medium-term. On energy policy, the authorities indicated they were taking an
active look at the implications of growing domestic energy supplies including the economic,
environmental, and security opportunities and challenges that it presents and would evaluate policy
options as needed.

Consolidation in 2011–13 was stronger than had been earlier anticipated (the federal primary
structural deficit declined by 1¼ percent of GDP more than was predicted in 2011). However, the
outlook for potential growth has worsened, lowering future federal revenues and compounding the
long-term fiscal sustainability challenge. As a result, under current policies, after stabilizing in 2015–
18, the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to begin rising again as aging-related pressures assert
themselves and interest rates normalize. Staff estimates that, relative to current policies, an
additional 2¾ percent of GDP in fiscal adjustment at the general government level would be needed
between now and 2023 in order to put the debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward path over the medium
term (even as age-related outlays for health and social security start to accelerate).
24.
A better policy mix. Given the substantial slack in the economy, there is a strong case to
provide continued policy support to the recovery. A credible medium-term fiscal consolidation plan
would provide the flexibility for some near-term fiscal support to the economy that is designed with
a focus toward reducing poverty and encouraging longer-term growth. Helping to kick-start growth
and job creation in this way would have near-term demand effects but, more importantly, lasting
implications for potential growth. It may also, at the margin, allow for an earlier withdrawal of
exceptional monetary stimulus with some positive spillovers to both domestic and international
financial stability.

Policies. In this vein, the President’s 2015 budget
outlines various valuable steps that would move toward
such a policy mix. It proposes health care savings (including
through higher Medicare premia), immigration reform, and
measures that limit tax deductions and exclusions for higher
earners. There are also sensible options laid out in various
proposals under consideration in Congress. Given the long
gestation period of reforms, producing measurable savings
over the medium term will require up-front action and will
need to encompass:



Controlling health care costs. Some progress has already been made in taming the fiscal
pressures from rising health care costs and there has been a tangible slowdown in the growth of
health spending, partly attributable to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).4
However, it is unclear to what extent this cost slowdown will persist and what are the fiscal and
cost implications of the Medicaid expansion under the ACA. As a result, more could be needed.
Measures that could be considered to bend the cost curve include the enhanced coordination of
services to patients with chronic conditions, the education of patients to reduce the overuse of
expensive medical procedures and technology, greater cost sharing with beneficiaries, and the
elimination of tax breaks for some of the more generous employer-sponsored health care plans.



Strengthening social security finances. The 2013 Annual Report by the Social Security Trustees
projects that the combined trust fund reserves would decline beginning in 2021 and reach zero
by 2033, at which point continuing income would be sufficient to pay only 77 percent of benefits.
The clock runs faster for the Disability Insurance Trust Fund, which would be exhausted as early
as 2016. Addressing the expected depletion of the Social Security Trust Funds will require early
and fundamental reforms. These could include a further gradual increase in the retirement age
(potentially with steps that link the future retirement age to average life expectancy or other
actuarial indicators of the solvency of the system), a modified benefit structure to increase
progressivity, an increase in the maximum taxable earnings for Social Security purposes, and an
indexation of benefit programs and tax provisions to chained CPI (rather than standard CPI).



Improving the tax structure and raising revenues. In addition to the tax measures described earlier
(to enhance long-term growth by making the direct tax system simpler, more equitable, and with
less negative incentive effects), there is also a need to raise additional revenues so as to
contribute to the needed medium-term fiscal adjustment. To do this, the U.S. could consider a

range of options, including a broad-based carbon tax, a higher federal gas tax, and a federallevel VAT.5
26.
Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed that the benefits to the U.S. economy from a clear
fiscal consolidation plan would be significant. They indicated this was exactly the approach that had
been taken in the President’s 2015 Budget, which proposed a roadmap for accelerating economic
growth, expanding opportunity for all Americans, and ensuring fiscal responsibility. Under their
budget plan, the federal deficit would be lowered to 1.6 percent of GDP by 2024, bringing debt
down to 69 percent of GDP. This would be achieved through improved efficiency savings as well as
longer-term health, tax, and immigration reforms. They also agreed that a credible medium-term
consolidation plan would give some space to provide more support to the recovery in the near term
(particularly through investments in infrastructure, education, and other productivity-enhancing
areas). However, they believed that, although it would be politically difficult to agree on a
comprehensive medium-term fiscal plan, it could be possible to achieve bipartisan support to pass,
by the end of the current administration, a reform of the business tax regime, increased funding for
infrastructure and work training programs, and immigration reform. In this regard, the Bipartisan
Budget Act of December 2013 could be a blueprint to replace automatic spending cuts in FY2016
with mandatory savings in future years. On health care, officials believed that the full effects of the
ACA had yet to be felt and they favored waiting on other health care reforms in order to allow the
system time to adapt to the various provisions of the ACA.
27.
The institutional framework. The three-week shutdown in October 2013 is estimated to
have subtracted 0.3 percentage points (annualized) from fourth quarter growth with the uncertainties
generating negative spillovers to various other countries. Fiscal policy uncertainty has been
temporarily reduced, but many of the same features—linked to discussions on appropriations,
negotiations on removing the sequester provisions for fiscal year 2016, and raising the debt ceiling—
could come back to the fore in spring 2015. A more durable, institutional solution to risks from
political brinkmanship is needed both for the sake of the U.S. and the global economy. Useful
measures could include reaching bipartisan agreement on a clear, simple medium-term fiscal
objective (with an integrated view of all budget functions and numerical targets for the debt and
deficit); adopting carefully-designed mechanisms to trigger revenue or spending adjustments if
targets are breached; an automatic process that would raise the debt ceiling once there is agreement
on the broad budget parameters; and shifting to a budget cycle where annual spending levels are
agreed for a two-year period (but with the possibility for supplemental budget resolutions during
that two-year window under clearly specified conditions).
28.
State and local finances. At the state level, higher levels of unfunded pension liabilities and
political polarization appear to be associated with lower credit ratings.6 To support their credit

ratings and lessen financing costs, state and local governments should adopt budget institutions that
reduce the impact of these factors, including less stringent voting requirements to implement
revenue increases and more flexible rainy-day fund rules. Steps could also be taken to require states
to measure their unfunded liabilities under more realistic actuarial assumptions and to restore
actuarial soundness for public sector employee pension and other post-employment benefit
programs.
29.
IMF quota reform. The implementation of the 2010 reforms remains a high priority and the
U.S. was urged to ratify these reforms at the earliest opportunity.
30.
Authorities’ views. Counterparts were supportive of the importance of budget process
reform, including through a more sensible approach to the debt ceiling, although they expressed
skepticism on whether any of these changes would be achievable in the near term. On IMF quota
reform, the authorities reiterated their belief that IMF quotas must truly reflect countries’ weight in
the global economy and indicated that they were actively working with Congress to secure
legislation to implement the 2010 IMF quota reforms.

THE PATH TO LIFT-OFF

muted. This could mean that—presuming systemic
financial stability risks are contained—there is some scope
for policy rates to stay at zero for longer while still keeping inflation under 2 percent. On the other
hand, inflation could start rising faster than expected. This would place increasing tension between
the Fed’s mandates of maximum employment and price stability. In that case, if expectations
remained anchored and financial stability risks were low, there could be room for the Fed to tolerate
a temporary and modest rise of inflation above the 2 percent target. Much will depend on the source
of the higher inflation. If the increase were transitory or not accompanied by rising wages, there
could well be more space to defer rate increases. However, if this inflation were driven by an
unexpected upswing in wages, then there would be a need to carefully reconsider whether preferred
measures of slack were still appropriate, reassess if the economy was actually much nearer to full
employment than it currently appears, and potentially begin raising rates at an earlier stage.

24

32.
Global spillovers. The impending increases in U.S. interest rates will have important
consequences for the global economy. The 2014 Spillover Report highlights that if these increases
come at a time of higher U.S. equity prices and a better U.S. growth outlook, they should generally
be a positive factor for other countries. However, there could still be pockets of stress in some of the
more vulnerable economies. In contrast, an increase in the long rate that is not accompanied by a
U.S. growth improvement (for example, a shift in Fed policy driven by concerns about a pickup in
inflation) will have an unambiguously negative outward spillover effect, especially for those emerging
markets (EMs) and advanced economies with already-weak fundamentals (as was seen in 2013). The
latter scenario would likely mean higher sovereign and corporate spreads, a slowdown or reversal of
capital flows, lower asset prices, and a drag on EM growth. Model estimates indicate that the
second-round effects—i.e., the multiplier effect of a movement in U.S. rates, spilling out to emerging
markets and other advanced economies, and then feeding back into U.S. growth and inflation—are
likely to be empirically modest. Of course, there could be larger feedback effects that are not easily
captured by such models (for example, in a tail event where U.S. policy action triggers crises in
several of the vulnerable countries) but any estimate of their possible size would be necessarily
speculative.
33.
Authorities’ views. The authorities indicated that monetary policy would adapt to changing
economic circumstances, as it always has, and would be focused on achieving the Fed’s mandate of
maximum employment and price stability. The authorities believed the recent increase in core PCE
inflation mainly reflected transitory or seasonal factors and emphasized that inflation is unlikely to
return to 2 percent until wage growth moves above labor productivity growth. In the event inflation
were to rise close to their longer-term goal but the economy appeared to remain well below full
employment, they would have to carefully re-examine their assessment of the degree of slack left in
the economy. The authorities also said that, while they would not try intentionally to overshoot that
target, if inflation were to rise above 2 percent the pace at which they would try to subsequently
disinflate would depend very much on how much progress had been made in achieving their
employment mandate. The authorities recognized the international implications of U.S. monetary
policy and pointed out that Fed staff had undertaken significant analysis to better understand the
size and nature of outward spillovers from policy actions. They also indicated they would not
discount the potential risks of second-round effects, but highlighted the uncertainty surrounding the
size of both spillovers and subsequent “spillbacks”.
34.
Communication. The Fed has made important and substantive efforts to increase
transparency and has adopted an adaptable approach to communication. So far, the Fed’s forward
guidance has generally been effective in managing expectations and reducing uncertainty about
future policy rates (Box 5). The return to qualitative forward guidance in March provides the Fed with
greater flexibility but, at the same time, puts an even higher premium on clear and systematic
communication to guide expectations, particularly given the potential adverse effects of
miscommunication for international financial markets. Enhancing the Fed’s communications toolkit
would be a natural evolution that could help temper the likelihood of market volatility or abrupt
asset price corrections along the exit path. Specifically, consideration could be given to:

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

UNITED STATES



Scheduling press conferences by the Fed Chair after each FOMC meeting to provide a more
frequent, structured environment to explain the committee’s evolving thinking.



Publishing a quarterly monetary policy report, that is endorsed by the FOMC and which conveys
more detail about the majority view of the FOMC on the outlook, policies, and the nature of
uncertainties around the baseline. Such a report may also convey dissenting views within the
FOMC as well as broader information on how the FOMC thinks about policy reactions in
plausible, non-baseline scenarios. This would complement the “dots” (i.e., the individual FOMC
member’s quantitative assessment of future macroeconomic variables and policy interest rates)
and provide a more systematic way for the Fed to convey the majority FOMC view.



Providing greater clarity from the FOMC on how it views current conditions for financial stability,
how such considerations figure into its monetary policy decisions—both about the balance sheet
and policy interest rates—and how these relate to its current mandate. This would allow the Fed
to convey to markets how its monetary policy may be affected by its assessment of a decline in
realized and expected volatility, a build-up in leverage, credit risks, unsustainable declines in term
premia, or other financial stability concerns.

35.
Authorities’ views. The authorities indicated that attempts had been made in the past to
agree on some form of monetary policy report but, in the end, it had proved very difficult to reach
agreement among the FOMC members on the structure of such a report and on a set of forecasts or
scenarios that the FOMC could somehow endorse. They would, however, continue to examine the
possibilities of such a product and emphasized the inappropriateness of viewing the median of the
summary of economic projections as a representation of the aggregate views of the FOMC. At
present, quarterly press conferences coincide with the publication of the summary of economic
projections and the authorities felt that tangible benefits from more frequent press conferences were
unclear at this stage. In terms of taking account of financial stability concerns, the authorities
indicated that this was a complex task because there is no solid analytical structure, as yet, to frame
such issues in the context of monetary policy. Nevertheless, the FOMC was highly attuned to
financial developments, and their assessment of progress toward maximum employment and price
stability certainly took due account of readings on financial developments.
36.
Operational issues. Barring unforeseen developments, the current pace of tapering should
be maintained, implying an end to asset purchases in late 2014. Normalization of the Fed’s balance
sheet over the medium term should occur by letting asset holdings mature (in line with the June
2011 “exit principles” and subsequent communications). It would be useful, however, for the Fed to
provide greater clarity at an early stage, through a formal update of its exit principles. The
effectiveness of the fed funds target as the signal for monetary policy may pose a challenge for the
operational framework once rates begin to rise. Although the fed funds market is unlikely to operate
as it did before the financial crisis, there are arguments for retaining the fed funds target, for now,
while maintaining flexibility to respond to market reactions during exit. The use of the overnight
reverse repo and interest on excess reserves should allow the Fed to set a solid floor on market rates,
and this could be complemented with term instruments to absorb excess liquidity. The recent
expansion in Fed counterparties for the overnight reverse repo potentially creates arbitrage

Box 5. The Impact of Fed’s Forward Guidance1
The Fed has used forward guidance since December 2008 to communicate its intention to keep the
policy interest rate low, providing added stimulus to the economy and reducing uncertainty about
future policy. Several studies find that interest rate expectations shifted at Fed announcements,

less attention has been paid to the impact of forward guidance on uncertainty.

opportunities by encouraging resources to migrate from banks—that are subject to more rigorous
regulations and deposit insurance fees—to money market funds that now have access to Fed
instruments. However, these risks could be managed through the setting of rates (on the overnight
reverse repo) and caps on either an aggregate or per counterparty basis.7
37.
Authorities’ views. The authorities noted that the FOMC continues to evaluate the
appropriate future operational framework for normalizing the stance of monetary policy in the
context of the Fed’s large balance sheet, including the appropriate role of the fed funds target in
communications regarding monetary policy during normalization. They argued that the fed funds
rate currently moves in line with other short term rates and that any reduction of its role would need
to be carefully communicated well in advance of its implementation. A new money market survey is
likely to help the Fed in better understanding different segments of the money market. The Fed
could also employ a variety of other short-term rates (such as the interest on excess reserves and the
overnight reverse repo rate) in its policy communications during exit.

are resilient to a severe deterioration of domestic

Nevertheless, in the latest Comprehensive Capital Analysis

Potential pressure points. The results from the

banks’ future profitability with the current return on equity well below pre-crisis averages. There is a
risk, therefore, that banks will try to restore their profitability through looser lending standards or a
lengthening of the duration of assets, boosting returns at the cost of larger asset-liability
mismatches. Avoiding such an outcome and preventing such incentives from creating new financial
risks will necessitate an intensive approach to bank supervision.

reputational risks to lenders; a tighter regulatory
environment and supervisory scrutiny; and uncertainty about the future structure of the mortgage
industry. Some steps have been taken, including by establishing a safe harbor for Qualified
Mortgages that meet a clear set of minimum standards and by clarifying the conditions for putbacks. There is scope to do more to lessen uncertainties facing lenders, without undermining
regulatory and supervisory scrutiny. In particular, efforts could be made to improve information
sharing during the mortgage origination process and to clarify further the scope of exemptions in
“sunset” clauses (i.e., provisions that release lenders from their liability under certain circumstances).

Housing finance. The federal government continues to play an unprecedented role in this
market, guaranteeing nearly 80 percent of newly originated loans. Going forward, there is a need for
a more clearly-defined and transparent government participation in the housing finance market with
a clear delineation—and transparent fiscal accounting—of public interventions designed to promote
social goals linked to housing. In the end, the system should have:


A substantial first-loss risk borne by private capital (rather than taxpayers);



An explicit public backstop that is limited to catastrophic credit losses with risk-based guarantee
fees;



A role for regulatory agencies in setting underwriting standards; and



A common platform for securitization.

The transition to such a system should be carefully phased so as to avoid undermining the ongoing
recovery of the housing market and the tentative restart in the private securitization market. It is also
essential that along this transition path appropriate underwriting standards and supervision are kept
in place to discourage a future cycle of overinvestment and unsustainable leverage in the housing
market.
43.
Corporate credit market risks. Ample liquidity and low rates have encouraged companies
(which already have significant liquid assets) to refinance, extend maturities, and push rollover risks
out into the future (Figure 3). At the same time, though, underwriting standards have been weakened
in some areas, particularly linked to lending to corporations with weaker credit fundamentals.
Indications of such risks include:


Gross issuance of high yield bonds and loans in 2011–13 is more than double that in
2005–07;



The share of bonds being issued with non-cash coupons or CCC ratings, and of loans that are
covenant-lite or with second-liens, is rising;



Debt-to-earning levels for corporations taking on highly leveraged loans are increasing.

Lower credit costs and longer maturities should lessen the likelihood of corporate stress. However, as
the credit cycle matures, increased exposure to more risky borrowers and the aggregate rise in
leverage in the nonfinancial corporate sector could contribute to a rising rate of default and lower
recoveries on defaulted debt.

(ETFs) and mutual funds as well as near-term illiquidity in
market functioning—could trigger a sudden, self-reinforcing re-pricing of a range of financial assets.
While the banking system would be robust to such a set of events, it could have more dramatic
implications for the nonbanks which, in turn, would hurt U.S. growth—through wealth effects from
lower asset prices, difficulties in rolling over or accessing new financing, and strains in the corporate
sector—as well as have negative knock-on effects internationally.
46.
Regulatory responses. Good progress has been achieved in implementing the Dodd-Frank
Act and moving ahead the financial regulatory agenda including through the finalization of the
Volcker rule, the designation of another systemically important financial institution, implementing
the over the counter (OTC) derivative reform, and putting in place liquidity and leverage
requirements that appear to be compatible with Basel III standards (an ongoing Regulatory

32

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Consistency Assessment Program will help provide a more definitive assessment). In addition, the
U.S. recently put in place a rule to require foreign bank organizations (FBOs) over a certain size to
incorporate as holding companies, a move that aligns the treatment of foreign and U.S. banks that
are operating in the U.S. and eliminates an existing regulatory distortion (Box 6). To tackle the
emerging pockets of risky behavior, there is scope for supervisors to tighten underwriting standards
for more risky commercial lending, to attach higher risk weights or tighter limits on large exposures
for particular assets (such as leveraged loans or high yield bonds), to strengthen prudential norms for
holdings of securitized loans such as collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) by regulated entities, and
to put additional capital charges on insurance companies. In addition, specific steps could be taken
linked to:


Money market mutual funds. Floating net asset value rules for prime money market mutual funds
would be particularly useful in mitigating the risk of runs and should be introduced for those
funds which invest in government securities. Other alternatives could include imposing stricter
liquidity requirements or investment restrictions. These options are being considered by the SEC
and will possibly result in a new rule for such funds.



Tri-party repo markets. Stricter haircuts and margins would limit the risk of a pre-default sale of
repo collateral (although the U.S. already imposes higher haircuts than the minimum defined by
the Financial Stability Board). In addition, it will be important to press ahead in developing
mechanisms to help counter the risk of ‘fire sale’ dynamics in the tri-party repo market.



Too important to fail. The U.S. should continue to build on the Dodd-Frank Act provisions that
allow for an orderly resolution of systemically important financial institutions. The remaining
rules needed to fully implement the orderly liquidation authority for systemic nonbanks should
be finalized. The resolution and recovery plans (submitted annually by the large banks) should be
thoroughly assessed against severe contingencies that involve a large cross-border component.
Progress is also needed in developing cooperative arrangements with regulators in other
jurisdictions to manage the resolution of institutions with a significant cross-border presence,
building on joint crisis planning exercises and in line with the principles of the Key Attributes of
Effective Resolution Regimes. There is also a case for other large, interconnected, and complex
financial institutions to be formally designated as systemically important in the insurance and
asset management sectors.



Strengthening the macro-prudential framework. Given the complexity of the U.S. regulatory
structure, there are potentially large gains in establishing a smoother sharing of data and analysis
among regulatory agencies and the Office of Financial Research. The macro-prudential
framework could also be made more responsive to the build-up of systemic risk by clarifying
how financial stability monitoring by the Office of Financial Research translates into FSOC
recommendations and by instituting a timely and structured process for the various regulatory
agencies to respond to FSOC recommendations.

Box 6. The Foreign Bank Organizations (FBO) Rule
By July 1, 2016 FBOs with more than $50 billion assets in U.S. bank and nonbank subsidiaries
will be required to reorganize their U.S. operations under an intermediate holding company
(IHC). The resulting IHC will become subject to a 3 percent Tier 1 leverage ratio and similar
prudential standards on liquidity as U.S. Bank Holding Companies (BHCs). FBOs with assets
between $10–50 billion will be subject to enhanced prudential standards.
Currently, FBOs play a significant role in the U.S. financial system accounting for 15 percent of
the total U.S. banking assets, approximately 40 percent of the reserves held at the Fed, around
one-half of the U.S. corporate bond issuance, and one-third of equity trading. Of the 22
primary dealers for the Federal Reserve, 15 are FBOs.
Requiring FBOs to hold more capital and liquidity in the IHCs improves the resilience of the
U.S. financial system and aligns FBO governance to U.S. BHC standards. The FBO rule appears
to be consistent with Basel III standards and moves the U.S. closer to the capital and liquidity
standards applied to investment banking subsidiaries of foreign banks in other jurisdictions
(notably the Euro Area, where investment banking subsidiaries are subject to Basel capital
requirements, and the U.K., where additional local liquidity requirements are applied to
banking subsidiaries of non-U.K. banks).
By requiring IHCs to be separately capitalized within the U.S., the rule may reduce bank
profitability at the parent level and induce organizational changes. The impact on U.S. bank
credit will likely be minor (loans and portfolio holdings of FBOs account for less than
10 percent of lending). The effect on U.S. capital markets could be larger. FBO broker-dealer
subsidiaries current have an estimated aggregate tier 1 leverage ratio of 1.6 percent and the
higher leverage ratio requirement may cause some of these types of FBOs to scale down their
U.S. operations rather than raise equity, perhaps moving some balance-sheet-intensive
operations to other jurisdictions. This could mean lower liquidity in the U.S. equity and bond
markets and higher transaction costs. Moreover, repo transactions will start to count towards
total leverage on a gross basis (rather than net as the current rules prescribe) which could
make some repo lending by FBOs uneconomic

repos of Treasuries and Agency MBS).
Using the limited publicly available data on noncommercial bank subsidiaries as of year-end 2013, it
appears that of the 14 FBOs that are likely to be
required to form IHCs, 4 currently fail to meet the 3
percent Tier 1 leverage ratio. Assuming zero retained
earnings or asset sales between now and July 1,
2016, the total capital shortfall to meet the Tier 1
leverage ratio would be about $17.4 billion (although
this estimate is tentative given the lack of public data
on the nature of FBO operations in the U.S.).

Global spillovers. Recent regulatory changes in the U.S.—including the Volcker rule and
rules on FBOs—will lower financial stability risks and reduce the associated risks of negative
spillovers from the U.S. In doing so, though, these changes may increase the capital costs of the
market making and trading activities of foreign banks operating in the U.S. There is little evidence, at
this stage, to conclude that the range of regulatory changes undertaken by the U.S. are adding to
financial fragmentation or are balkanizing the global financial system. Such potential spillovers will,
however, be a topic that will be examined further in the context of the upcoming Financial Stability
Assessment Program (FSAP).
48.
Financial integrity. Initiatives are underway to strengthen financial institutions’
requirements to identify and verify beneficial owners and to access information about beneficial
ownership and control of U.S. corporations. These initiatives aim to prevent the abuse of legal
persons and arrangements for financial crimes and to address deficiencies identified in the last
Financial Action Task Force (FATF) mutual evaluation report of June 2006. However, these initiatives
may only be implemented after 2015 and would imply an only modest improvement in the
transparency of U.S. corporations and trusts. It will remain difficult, in particular, to pursue either the
laundering of proceeds of foreign tax crimes taking place inside the U.S. or the use of U.S.
corporations to commit tax crimes abroad.
49.
Authorities’ views. Substantial progress has been made in the regulatory framework, in
increasing capital and liquidity buffers, and reducing leverage in the financial system. The authorities
also felt that the FSOC process was working well. Low interest rates could create potential financial
stability risks but, at this stage, these appear not to be systemic and are limited to pockets of
vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, low levels of market pricing of volatility were of concern. Officials
underscored that interest and funding risks are being closely watched as are other areas including
embedded risks in securities lending and the repo market. The authorities expected the Securities
Exchange Commission (SEC) to soon issue rules to tackle risks in the money market mutual funds.
The authorities indicated that work is under way to better understand risks in the asset management
industry and to modernize the regulatory framework for the insurance sector. Officials noted that the
U.S. is committed to adhering to its commitments under the G20 financial reform agenda and is
encouraging other jurisdictions to do so also. This has included taking leadership in international
derivatives regulation and building on international agreements on leverage ratios for banks. The
authorities indicated that they are actively pursuing ways to make access to mortgages for
creditworthy borrowers easier but, without passage of legislation, it would be difficult to fully resolve
uncertainties on the future of the housing finance system. Finally, the authorities looked forward to
the upcoming FSAP as a means to engage in a full assessment of the financial system and the U.S.
approach to regulatory reform as well as to discuss the many changes made to the U.S. financial
system since the 2010 FSAP.

STAFF APPRAISAL
50.
Growth. Recent data suggest a meaningful rebound in activity is now underway. This
renewed dynamism will provide only a partial offset to the weak first quarter and GDP is projected to
expand at 1.7 percent for 2014 as a whole. Barring unforeseen shocks, growth is expected to well
exceed potential for the foreseeable future and, on an annual basis, should rise to 3 percent in 2015.
51.
Jobs. Employment growth has been healthy but labor markets are weaker than is implied by
the headline unemployment number. Long-term unemployment and the rate of involuntary parttime work are high, labor force participation is well below what can be explained by demographic
factors, and wages are stagnant. With better growth prospects, the U.S. should see steady progress
in job creation but headline unemployment is expected to decline only slowly—in part because
improving prospects will draw discouraged workers back into the labor force—and long-term
unemployment will take time to fall back to historic levels.
52.
Poverty. Reducing poverty will require, first and foremost, a much more robust return to
growth and job creation. However, other policies have a role to play. The recent expansion of
Medicaid and the increase in health insurance coverage under the ACA have been concrete steps
whose effect on poverty and health outcomes should become more evident over time. An expansion
of the EITC (including making permanent the various extensions that are due to expire in 2017)
would also raise living standards for the very poor. Finally, given its current low level, the minimum
wage should be increased. This would help raise incomes for millions of working poor and would
have strong complementarities with the suggested improvements in the EITC, working in tandem to
ensure a meaningful increase in after-tax earnings for the nation’s poorest households.
53.
Productivity and labor supply. To offset the expected slowdown in potential growth
immediate steps should be taken to raise productivity, encourage innovation, augment human and
physical capital, and increase labor force participation. Such measures should involve investments in
infrastructure and education, improving the tax system, active labor market policies, a broad, skillsbased approach to immigration reform, and efforts to fully capitalize on the gains from rising U.S.
energy independence. No single measure will be sufficient and a manifold solution will certainly be
required. There is no shortage of good ideas currently under public debate and so the challenge
ahead will be to forge political agreement on specific legislation.
54.
External assessment. Assessed imbalances and fiscal policy gaps in the U.S. have improved
considerably over the past few years, creating significant positive spillovers to the global economy.
The move toward increased energy independence will have a further positive effect on the U.S.
external accounts. The U.S. external position appears broadly consistent with medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policies.
55.
Fiscal policy. The recent experience of debt ceiling brinkmanship and the government shut
down once again illustrates the difficulty of finding political common ground on fiscal policy and the
negative consequences—for both the U.S. and global economy—from political discord linked to

36

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED STATES

fiscal policies. The Bipartisan Budget Act, enacted in December 2013, and the subsequent raising of
the debt ceiling were important steps to address fiscal risks and improve both the pace and
distribution of near-term deficit reduction. Going forward, even in the absence of a fully articulated
medium-term consolidation plan, there is room to build on this progress through the identification
of targeted areas to expand the near-term budget envelope, funded by offsetting savings in future
years. Specific near-term measures that should be supported—many of which were in the
Administration’s budget proposal—include front-loaded infrastructure spending, a better tax system,
active labor market policies, and improving educational spending. Beyond this, further steps will be
needed to put the general government debt on a sustainable longer-term path. This will require
reaching political agreement on a credible and detailed medium-term fiscal consolidation path that
includes measures to lower health care spending, restore solvency to the social security system,
reform the tax system, and raise revenues. Finally, while not a panacea, changes to budget
procedures—including switching to a two-year budget cycle—could have a lasting effect in lessening
fiscal policy uncertainty.
56.
Monetary policy. The economy is expected to reach full employment only by end-2017 and
inflationary pressures are expected to remain muted. If true, policy rates could afford to stay at zero
for longer than the mid-2015 date currently foreseen by markets. Policy would, however, have to
remain cognizant of burgeoning financial stability risks, particularly those that are inherently difficult
to contain through available regulatory and supervisory tools. If inflation were to rise more rapidly
than expected and the economy was still well below full employment, tolerating a modest,
temporary rise of inflation above the longer-term goal could be consistent with the Fed’s balanced
approach as long as inflation expectations remained anchored and financial stability risks were low.
There could also be scope to enhance the Fed’s communications toolkit. Given the global spillovers
from U.S. monetary policy, a well-communicated normalization of U.S. monetary conditions, in the
context of robust U.S. growth, would be positive for the global economy.
57.
Financial stability risks. Over the past few years, much has been done to reduce financial
system risks: the banks are stronger, corporate balance sheets are healthy, leverage has been
contained, and the regulatory framework has been greatly improved. Nevertheless, the prolonged
period of very low interest rates continues to raise financial stability concerns, particularly related to
activities in the so-called “shadow” banks and in other nonbank intermediaries. Steps that could be
taken to tackle these risks and lessen the likelihood of negative spillovers to the global economy
include tighter underwriting standards, higher risk weights, tighter limits on large exposures to riskier
assets, and stronger prudential norms for the holding of securitized loans by regulated entities.
Addressing the remaining vulnerabilities of the money market funds and of the tri-party repo market
also remains a priority. In addition, the U.S. should continue to implement measures that allow for
the orderly resolution of too-important-to-fail financial institutions, including through deepening
cooperation with other jurisdictions to manage the resolution of institutions with a significant crossborder presence. The insurance sector warrants particular attention and would benefit from stronger
and more uniform capital adequacy and solvency oversight standards, refinement and harmonization
of stress testing exercises, greater efforts to close data gaps, further designation of systemically
important firms, and a larger federal role in insurance regulation and oversight. The U.S. should

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

37

UNITED STATES

continue to play a lead role in advancing the global regulatory reform agenda, ensuring consistency
with international rules and best practices, and limiting the opportunities for regulatory arbitrage
while remaining attuned to the spillover implications of regulatory changes on the international
financial system.
58.
Housing finance. Limited availability of mortgage financing is a pressing constraint on
economic growth. Policy efforts have been made to encourage greater availability of mortgage
credit. However, the recovery of mortgage lending to lower-rated borrowers is likely to be a slow
process. Legislative changes that clarify the future role of government in housing finance would help.
While reaching agreement on legislation will be hard, in anticipation of broader legislative actions,
many of these objectives can still be realized in the medium term through administrative action
including expanding the use of market transactions to transfer first-loss risks from the agencies to
private investors; moving gradually to higher and more risk-based guarantee fees; steadily building
up capital within the agencies while reducing their role in housing finance; and establishing a single
securitization platform.

President's FY2015 Budget
CBO's Assessment of the Budget
CBO Baseline Scenario (current law)

Sources: Congressional Budget Office; Office of Management and Budget; and IMF staff projections.
Note: Staff baseline counts in the savings from the reduction in overseas contingency operations and assumes that current tax policies are mostly
extended (with the notable exception of bonus depreciation), Medicare payment rates are held constant, and automatic spending cuts are
replaced with back-loaded measures (at the same proportion in FY2016 and latter years as the replacement achieved for FY2014 and FY2015 by
the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013). By contrast, the President's Budget assumes only a few of the current tax policies will be extended (Earned
Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit provisions extended under the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 and due to expire in 2017) and the
policy measures proposed by the Administration (including capping of deductions for higher-income taxpayers and immigration reform) will be
implemented. CBO baseline does not count in the savings from the reduction in overseas contingency operations and assumes that expiring tax
provisions are not extended, Medicare payment rates are reduced, and automatic spending cuts take place as currently written in law. The
President's Budget uses the OMB macroeconomic assumptions. CBO uses CBO macroeconomic assumptions both for its own baseline and its
assessment of the President's Budget.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely
to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the
risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability
between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the
source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive
risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Medium

Low

A sharp increase in geopolitical tensions
surrounding Russia/Ukraine that creates significant
disruptions in global financial, trade and commodity
markets. Heightened geopolitical risks in the Middle
East, leading to a sharp rise in oil prices.

A rise in oil prices would have a negative
impact on the U.S. with a possible flight to
safety resulting in dollar appreciation. A
sustained 15 percent increase in oil prices

Annex II. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
The budget deficit in the United States has been reduced significantly since 2011. Yet, the public debt
ratio remains on an unsustainable trajectory. Under the baseline scenario, general government gross
debt is projected to briefly stabilize in 2015–18 at about 106 percent of GDP but starts rising again as
spending pressures on entitlement programs rise and interest rates normalize. The public debt
dynamics are highly sensitive to growth and interest rate assumptions, primarily reflecting the fact that
the U.S. public debt ratio already exceeds 100 percent of GDP. Gross financing needs are large but
manageable given the safe haven status of the United States. A medium-term, credible consolidation
plan remains a key policy priority.

Background
About $2.8 trillion in medium-term fiscal consolidation measures were legislated in 2011–13 to tackle
the high public debt ratio, which has doubled at the federal government level since 2007 as a result
of the financial crisis and the ensuing recession.
a.

The Budget Control Act enacted in August 2011 capped discretionary spending, saving about
$900 billion over 10 years relative to the CBO baseline.

b.

Additional savings worth $1.2 trillion over 10 years were triggered by the failure of the
Congressional Committee on Deficit Reduction in November 2011. These cuts took effect in
March 2013 through cancellation of budget authority (“sequestration”) in FY2013. The
Bipartisan Budget Act of December 2013 partially reversed the cuts scheduled to take place
in FY2014 and FY2015 but still kept three-fourths of the cuts in place and made up for the
partial reversal by extending certain direct spending cuts scheduled to end in FY2021 to
FY2022 and FY2023. The cuts in FY2014–23 will be executed through caps on appropriation
levels.

c.

The American Taxpayer Relief Act signed into law in January 2013 increased the top ordinary
income tax rate as well as the tax rate on capital gains and dividends, phased out personal
exemptions, and limited itemized deductions for upper-income taxpayers, raising $700 billion
over 10 years relative to the CBO alternative baseline.

Despite the substantial deficit reduction achieved so far and the legislated savings in the pipeline,
U.S. public finances remain on an unsustainable trajectory.

Assessment
The baseline. For the purposes of the 10-year fiscal projections, real GDP growth is assumed to
converge to the potential beyond the standard 5-year WEO horizon. Under staff’s baseline projection
which, in addition to the legislated budgetary savings, includes the savings from the drawdown of
overseas contingency operations and removal of emergency funding for disaster relief, the debt ratio
temporarily stabilizes in 2015–18. However, the debt ratio starts rising again at the end of the decade
given the spending pressures from an aging population and excess cost growth in the health care
sector (even taking into account the more optimistic trend growth based on the recent slowdown in
health care expenditure growth rate). Federal debt held by the public is projected to increase from
72 percent of GDP now to 81 percent of GDP in FY2024, with general government gross debt
approaching 111 percent of GDP by CY2023.
Debt servicing costs. The fiscal projections are being substantially improved by the current
favorable interest rate-growth differential. Reflecting accommodative monetary policy and the safe
haven status of the United States, real interest rates have fallen well below GDP growth. Under staff’s
baseline, as monetary policy normalizes, the average interest rate is projected to rise gradually from
the current historical lows and reach about 5¼ percent by 2023 (compared to a pre-crisis average of
6½ percent). As a result, real interest rates will become a major debt-creating flow after 2019. In
staff’s view, aiming for a medium-term primary surplus of about 1¼ percent of GDP would be
appropriate to put the public debt ratio firmly on a downward path. The target primary surplus
would be even higher in the long run to bring the debt ratio closer to the pre-crisis levels by 2030.
Realism. Baseline economic assumptions and fiscal projections are generally within the error band
observed for all countries. While ambitious, the projected fiscal adjustment is realistic based on the
consolidation episodes observed in 1990–2011.
Stress tests. The public debt dynamics are highly sensitive to growth and interest rate assumptions,
primarily reflecting the fact that the U.S. public debt ratio already exceeds 100 percent of GDP. An
increase of 200 basis points in the sovereign risk premium would mean a debt ratio that is about
17 percentage points above the baseline. If real GDP growth turns out to be one standard deviation
below the baseline, the public debt would reach 122 percent of GDP in 2023. A scenario involving a
1 percentage slippage in the planned consolidation over the next two years would lead to a gross
debt-to-GDP ratio of 116 percent in 2023. A combined macro-fiscal shock could raise the public debt
ratio as high as 137 percent of GDP by the end of the 10-year horizon. An exchange rate shock is
unlikely to have important implications for debt sustainability in the United States given that all debt
is denominated in local currency and the reserve currency status of the dollar.
Mitigating factors. The depth and liquidity of the U.S. Treasury market as well as its safe haven
status at times of distress represent a mitigating factor for relatively high external financing
requirements.

Annex III. U.S. Responses to Past Policy Advice
Fiscal policy. Over the last few years staff has emphasized the importance of a medium-term fiscal
consolidation plan to restore long-run fiscal sustainability, stressing that early action is needed to
slow entitlement spending. The prospects for such a comprehensive plan remain unfavorable, given
the lack of political consensus. However, cost saving measures that were part of the Affordable Care
Act appear to be lowering health care inflation. Staff also called for a more balanced and gradual
pace of fiscal consolidation in the near-term and the replacement of automatic spending cuts (also
referred to as the sequester) with back-loaded savings. The Bipartisan Budget Act of December 2013
moved in this direction by raising the spending caps imposed by the sequester for 2014 and 2015 in
exchange for savings in future years. In addition, suspending the debt ceiling until March 2015 and
passing the Consolidated Appropriations Act in early 2014 were all steps in a positive direction to
lessen fiscal uncertainties.
Monetary policy. Given the large output gap and well-anchored inflation expectations, staff
supported a highly accommodative monetary policy stance. Last year, it also stressed the importance
of maintaining effective communications. The Fed continues to maintain a supportive monetary
policy and have made increasing efforts—in FOMC statements, press conferences, and speeches—
to articulate is views on progress toward the Fed’s longer-term objectives.
Financial policies. Substantial progress has been made on the national and global financial reform
agenda over the last few years, and many of the policy suggestions contained in last year’s U.S. staff
report have been implemented (including Basel III capital standards and the finalization of the
Volcker rule). Still, a few reforms emphasized by staff remain to be completed, particularly those
concerning the regulation of money market mutual funds.
Housing policy. Staff has stressed the need to reduce regulatory uncertainty (particularly on the
risks that banks could be required to repurchase defaulted loans from the GSEs). Measures have
been taken to lessen these uncertainties. Staff also called for a rapid completion of the regulation
requiring banks to retain part of mortgage risk on their balance sheet (i.e., the Qualified Residential
Mortgage standards) and in advancing legislation to reshape housing finance. On the latter,
legislative proposals have moved forward in Congress but the likelihood of these becoming law
remains slim.
Structural policies. The Administration has launched new initiatives for job training and
apprenticeships, in line with staff’s recommendations on more active labor market policies. Building a
political consensus on a reform of the tax system in the direction envisaged by staff (a less complex
system with a broader tax base and lower rates) remains difficult and there is no plan to introduce a
VAT or a carbon tax.

Background. The net international investment position (NIIP) declined from -15 per cent of GDP in 2010 to -27 percent of GDP in
2013, reflecting current account deficits as well as the stronger performance of the U.S. stock market relative to global markets.
The U.S. has a positive net equity position, with sizable portfolio equity and direct investment abroad, and a negative debt position
vis-à-vis the rest of the world, owing to sizeable foreign holdings of U.S. Treasuries and corporate bonds. Gross assets and
liabilities are about 130 and 160 percent of GDP, respectively. Under staff’s baseline scenario, U.S. NIIP would deteriorate by about
1
5 percentage points of GDP over the next five years.
Assessment. Risks to external stability could arise from a decline in foreign demand for U.S. debt securities (the bulk of U.S.
external liabilities), driven for example by a protracted failure to restore long-run fiscal sustainability. Still, given the dollar’s reserve
currency status, current vulnerabilities are limited. Most U.S. foreign assets are denominated in foreign currency and over 50
percent are in the form of FDI and portfolio equity claims, whose value tend to decline when global growth and stock markets are
weak, as well as when the U.S. dollar appreciates.

Current account

Background. The U.S. current account (CA) deficit continued to narrow from its pre-crisis height of 6 percent of GDP to 2.3
percent in 2013, reflecting a sharp reduction in the fiscal deficit (which also helped to lower the global fiscal gap and hence the
impact of U.S. policy distortions on other countries), higher private saving, lower investment in the aftermath of the financial crisis,
and a stronger energy trade balance (due to the rapid increase of unconventional energy production). Going forward, the current
account deficit is projected to widen to about 2¾ percent of GDP by 2019, as stronger private demand leads to a closure of the
output gap but with the effect tempered by a further improvement in the energy balance.
Assessment. The EBA model estimates a CA gap of -1 percent of GDP for 2013. The staff view is broadly similar, on balance
assessing the cyclically-adjusted current account to be between 0 and 1.5 percent of GDP weaker than the level implied by
medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies.

Real exchange
rate

Background. The real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciated by about 2 percent during 2013, but remains around 10 percent
below its average value over the past two decades.
Assessment. Indirect estimates of the REER (drawing on the EBA current account estimate and the staff’s current account
assessment range) suggest some overvaluation (within the 0 to 10 percent range). However, direct analyses of the REER in the EBA
would suggest an undervaluation of around 8 percent in 2013.2 Taking into account both methodologies, and acknowledging
some uncertainty associated with the boom in unconventional energy production on the US external position, staff assesses the
REER to be broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies (with a range of -5 percent to +10 percent).

Capital and
financial
accounts:
flows and policy
measures

Background. Inflows and outflows picked up in 2013 but are substantially lower than pre-Lehman levels. Portfolio inflows halved
in 2013 relative to 2012 but were more than offset by stronger bank inflows (which were negative in 2012). On the outflow side,
there was a large increase in U.S. portfolio investment overseas. The U.S. dollar reserve currency status and safe haven motives
boost foreign demand for U.S. Treasury securities during periods of market turbulence. Hence the outlook for U.S. capital flows will
depend on global financial stability and the pace of the global recovery, as well as on the outlook for the U.S. economy and its
public finances.
Assessment. The United States has a fully open capital account. Vulnerabilities are limited by the dollar’s status as a reserve
currency and the United States’ role as a safe haven.

FX intervention
and reserves
Technical
Background
Notes

Assessment. The dollar has the status of a global reserve currency. Reserves held by the U.S. are typically low relative to standard
metrics, but the currency is free floating.
1
2

Forecasts of U.S. NIIP reflect mainly projected CA flows.

Such REER regression models may, however, be less reliable and have difficulty explaining the REER’s weakness (relative to its
own history) in terms of changing fundamentals or policy distortions.

Overall Assessment
Overall Assessment:
The U.S. external position is broadly consistent
with medium-term fundamentals and desirable
policies. The US external position has improved
considerably in recent years, as have assessed
imbalances and fiscal policy gaps. The boom in
unconventional energy production contributed
to the improvement. Going forward, although
there is some uncertainty on its full potential
impact on the US current account, the positive
term of trade shock is expected to boost
national saving, partially offsetting the
negative impact of stronger domestic
investment.

Potential policy responses:
Over the medium term, fiscal consolidation
should aim for a general government primary
surplus of about 1¼ percent of GDP
(corresponding to a federal government
primary surplus of about 2 percent, higher
than the 1½ percent surplus envisaged in the
President’s budget and staff’s projection of a
small deficit). Structural policies should be
implemented to raise productivity and labor
force growth including by taking steps to fully
exploit the benefits of the boom in
unconventional energy production. This would
be consistent with maintaining external
stability and achieving full employment.

Exchange Rate Arrangements. The exchange rate of the U.S. dollar floats independently and is
determined freely in the foreign exchange market. The United States has accepted the obligations
under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3 and 4 of the IMF's Articles of Agreement and maintains an
exchange system free of multiple currency practices and restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions, except for those measures imposed for security
reasons. The United States notifies the maintenance of measures imposed for security reasons under
Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51). The last of these notifications was made on June 2014
(see EBD/14/35, June 19, 2014).

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on the United States
July 22, 2014

1.
This statement reports on information that has become available since the staff
report was issued. It does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Recent indicators. Labor market conditions continued to improve. Jobless claims fell
in the first week of July and are on a downward path from earlier in the year. The number of
job openings rose in May to their highest levels since August 2007. Retail sales growth in
June was solid and there were upward revisions to the data for April and May. An increase in
the July homebuilder’s index suggests improving confidence in the housing recovery. The
Fed’s Empire manufacturing index for July was at its highest level since May 2010 and
industrial production grew at (an annualized) 5.5 percent in the second quarter of the year.
3.
Fed outlook. In testimony to the Congress on July 15 and 16, Chair Yellen noted that
the still-elevated unemployment rate, depressed participation rates, and slow pace of wage
growth suggest that the level of slack in the labor market remains considerable, despite recent
improvements in labor market indicators. Chair Yellen noted that “almost all” FOMC
participants expected the first rate hike at some time in 2015 and that asset purchases would
likely conclude after the October FOMC meeting. The Fed Chair assessed that the threats to
financial stability at this stage appeared moderate.
4.
Regulatory cooperation. On July 8, the US Treasury and the European Commission
reiterated their commitment to cooperate on financial market regulation, in particular on
OTC derivatives regulation and cross-border resolution.
5.
The Mid-Session Budget Review. The growth projection for 2014 was revised down
from 3.1 percent in the March Budget to 2.4 percent (although the estimate does not
incorporate the latest GDP estimate for Q1). Average growth in 2015–19 is also projected to
be slightly lower than in the Budget. These revisions imply there will be modestly larger
fiscal deficits and a higher debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium term. Nevertheless, the
federal deficit for FY2014 and 2015 has been revised down by around ¼ percent of GDP in
each year (to 3.4 and 2.9 percent of GDP respectively) due to slower-than-expected spending
in a range of programs (including the use of Hurricane Sandy recovery funds, defense
spending, and healthcare).
6.
Legislative action. On July 9, Congress passed the “Workforce Innovation and
Opportunity Act”, a compromise between the Senate and House versions of a bill that
reauthorizes and streamlines the existing job training programs and gives states more
flexibility in using federal funds. Committees in the House and Senate have both approved
measures to temporarily address the funding of the Highway Trust Fund; work will now aim
to reconcile the differences between the two proposals.

Press Release No.14/359
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 23, 2014

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with the United States

On July 22, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the United States. 1
Economic activity in the U.S. accelerated in the second half of 2013, but an unusually harsh
winter conspired with other factors—including an inventory correction, a still-struggling
housing market, and slower external demand—caused momentum to fade in early 2014,
leading to a contraction in growth of 2.9 percent in the first quarter.
Over the past few months, however, a broad-based improvement appears to be unfolding as
evidenced by stronger employment and industrial production numbers. Looking ahead,
activity is projected to accelerate in the remainder of this year to well-above potential (in the
3–3½ percent range), although the drag on growth from the first quarter contraction will not
be offset. This means growth for the year as a whole will be a disappointing 1.7 percent.
More positively, barring unforeseen shocks, 2015 growth should accelerate to the fastest
annual pace since 2005, propelled by strong consumption growth, a declining fiscal drag, a
pickup in residential investment, and easy financial conditions.
Risks around this outlook include slowing growth in emerging markets, oil price spikes
related to events in Ukraine and Iraq, and earlier-than-expected interest rate rises. However,
as confidence in the recovery picks up, nonresidential investment could grow more than
expected and labor force participation could bounce back.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary
is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summing ups can be found
here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2

Looking at the medium term, potential growth is forecast to average just above 2 percent for
the next several years, significantly below the historic average growth rate. This downgrade
reflects the effects of an aging population and more modest prospects for productivity
growth. This makes it critical for the authorities to take immediate steps to raise productivity,
encourage innovation, augment human and physical capital, and increase labor force
participation. Moreover, recent growth has not been particularly inclusive, with the latest
data pointing to almost 50 million Americans living in poverty (as shown by the Census
Bureau’s supplemental poverty measure) and the official poverty rate stuck above 15 percent
despite the ongoing recovery. In terms of policy actions, the Federal Reserve has made
important and substantive efforts to increase transparency and has adopted an adaptable
approach to communication. The recent shift to qualitative forward guidance provides the
Fed with greater flexibility but puts an even higher premium on clear and systematic
communication to guide expectations. On the fiscal side, following the debt ceiling
brinkmanship and the government shutdown in October 2013, the Bipartisan Budget Act and
the subsequent raising of the debt ceiling were important steps to reduce fiscal risks.
However, the need for a medium-term fiscal adjustment to ensure a downward path for the public
debt remains. On the financial side, progress has been achieved on variety of fronts, including

implementing the Dodd Frank Act, finalizing the Volcker rule, and designating another
systemic important financial institution. In addition, the U.S. recently put in place a rule to
require foreign bank organizations over a certain size to incorporate as holding companies, a
move that aligns the treatment of foreign and U.S. banks that are operating in the U.S. and
eliminates an existing regulatory distortion.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors broadly agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They welcomed
signs of a meaningful economic rebound following a temporary setback in the first quarter of
2014. Directors noted that stronger growth is expected to be underpinned by a continuation
of accommodative monetary policy, a substantial reduction in the fiscal drag, and improved
labor and housing conditions. At the same time, however, risks and uncertainties continue to
weigh on the outlook, including the pace of interest rate increases and market expectations,
and growth prospects in other advanced and emerging market economies. Directors
underscored that higher growth in, and strong policy action by, the United States would have
important positive global spillovers.
Directors supported focusing policy efforts on managing monetary policy normalization,
raising potential growth, reducing long-term unemployment, tackling poverty, and
maintaining debt sustainability over the medium term. Achieving these objectives would call
for wide-ranging measures—and, more importantly, political consensus—in such areas as

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any

investments in infrastructure and education, a comprehensive tax reform, active labor market
policies, and a skills-based approach to immigration reform. Directors concurred that an
expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit, possibly complemented by a higher minimum
wage, would help address poverty and inequality while promoting labor participation.
Directors welcomed the Bipartisan Budget Act and the subsequent raising of the debt ceiling
as important steps to address fiscal risks. They emphasized the critical importance of
reaching agreement on a credible medium-term fiscal consolidation plan, which would help
to articulate a roadmap for achieving debt sustainability and provide an important anchor for
fiscal policy to support the recovery in the short run. In this regard, while a few Directors
stressed the need to stay the course of fiscal consolidation, most saw scope for expanding the
near-term budget envelope in areas with a high and lasting growth impact, which would need
to be funded by savings in future years, including through upfront action to control health
care and entitlement spending. Directors also encouraged steps to improve budget procedures
and the institutional framework more broadly, with a view to reducing uncertainty in the
future.
Directors agreed that the current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy is
appropriate, consistent with the Federal Reserve’s objectives of maximum employment and
price stability. They generally viewed that, in the case of a slow progression toward full
employment and continued subdued inflation, policy rates could stay at zero for longer than
currently anticipated so long as inflation expectations remain firmly anchored. Directors
recommended, however, that the authorities monitor wage developments closely and remain
cognizant of financial stability risks. They welcomed the Federal Reserve’s forward guidance
and recommended continued efforts to enhance its communications to provide greater clarity
about monetary policy decisions, ensuring a smooth normalization.
Directors welcomed progress in strengthening the resilience of the financial system over the
past few years. They called for continued vigilance to potential systemic risks associated with
the prolonged period of very low interest rates, particularly activities of nonbank
intermediaries. Directors underscored the benefits of a strong macroprudential framework,
and tightened supervision and prudential norms across banks and nonbanks, with a few
suggesting that care be taken to ensure a level playing field between domestic and foreign
banks. Directors looked forward to continued U.S. leadership in advancing the global
financial regulatory reform agenda.
Directors acknowledged recent initiatives to address remaining weaknesses in the housing
market. They encouraged further steps to improve the availability of mortgage financing and
to clarify the role of the government in housing finance, including through administrative
action as efforts on broader legislative changes continue.
