PRGF/Debt Relief. The Executive Board approved a PRGF arrangement with access
of 10 percent of quota on June 5, 2006. Rwanda reached the completion point under
the enhanced HIPC Initiative in April 2005 and qualified for the MDRI in January
2006.

•

2004 Article IV consultation. At the Article IV Board meeting on October 6, 2004,
Directors identified major challenges ahead in sustaining economic growth to reduce
poverty while achieving fiscal and external sustainability. They urged the authorities
to strengthen the financial sector, improve tax efficiency, and limit external
borrowing.

•

Main topics. The report recommends completion of the first review under the PRGF.
Article IV discussions centered on obstacles to growth, enhancing competitiveness
and, with Rwanda expected to be among the first recipients of any scaled-up aid,
macroeconomic challenges from a scaling up and preparations for effective use of
aid. Selected Issues Papers were written on the latter two topics.

•

Exchange system. Rwanda adopted a market-determined exchange rate system in
March 1995. However, for more than a year, the exchange rate has in fact behaved
like a conventional fixed peg. Rwanda has accepted obligations under Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3 and 4, and maintains a system free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions.

•

Participants. The mission met with Minister of Finance and Economic Planning
Musoni, Governor Kanimba of the National Bank of Rwanda, other government
officials, and representatives of the private sector, civil society, and the international
community during October 18–November 3, 2006. The mission team headed by
Ms. Kostial consisted of Mr. Darius Mr. Mitchell, and Ms. Kaendera (all AFR) and
was assisted by Mr. Engström, the resident representative.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Rwanda must increase its growth rates in order to reduce poverty. Since the 1994
genocide national rehabilitation has moved forward, output has recovered and, with the help
of debt relief, macroeconomic stability has been largely achieved. However, per capita
growth has recently slowed and poverty is pervasive. Stimulating growth would require
prioritizing policies to address Rwanda’s severe infrastructure gap and low agricultural
yields, enhance competitiveness, and continue social and structural reforms. The PRSP
update planned for 2007 is expected to address these issues. Prospects for scaling-up aid are
encouraging.
Policy implementation has been satisfactory. Growth is expected to exceed 4 percent
because activity is buoyant in the manufacturing, services, and financial sectors. However,
reflecting primarily a rise in food and energy prices, 12-month inflation gradually increased
to 11 percent in November. Macroeconomic performance is in line with the program, but
short-term risks have evolved on the monetary side from a large increase in private sector
credit and the central bank’s foreign exchange intervention policy. Structural reforms are
broadly on track. All but two performance criteria (PCs) for the first review were met. The
quantitative end-June PC on priority spending and the structural end-August PC on
improving the monitoring of projects accounts were missed; because both deviations were
temporary, staff recommends waivers.
The greatest challenge for Rwanda in 2007 is to absorb a scaling up of aid while
preserving macroeconomic stability. With indications of real appreciation already
occurring in 2006, managing the impact of fiscal policies on domestic demand will be all the
more important if aid is scaled up, as expected, in 2007. Acknowledging large development
needs, the program allows for an increase in the deficit (excluding spending on peacekeeping
and demobilization) by about 1 percent of GDP. Grants are likely to be higher than
programmed, but the program would accommodate any further expansion in the deficit only
after a review has established that the expansion would not lead to a rekindling of inflation or
undue crowding out of the private sector. The central bank has committed to closely monitor
credit and inflationary developments and tighten its monetary stance if necessary.
The structural agenda is designed to address impediments to growth. Reforms will focus
on the financial sector, private sector development, public expenditure management, and
establishing a poverty profile for Rwanda.
Program risks have increased. The main risk is that the monetary program could go off
track if the central bank resists pressures for an underlying exchange rate appreciation. A
new risk has emerged on the security front because Rwanda may have to cope with refugees
from neighboring countries.

I. RWANDA’S CHALLENGES
1.
Rwanda has made great strides since the 1994 genocide. National rehabilitation
has moved forward. There were presidential and legislative elections in 2003, and there have
been community-based hearings of those accused of genocide. Output has recovered and,
with the help of debt relief, macroeconomic stability has been largely achieved. Since the
2004 Article IV consultation the authorities’ program, supported by PRGF arrangements, has
been broadly on track and Rwanda has made good progress in responding to Fund advice
(Box 1).

Status

Strengthen economic legislation to improve Laws on income and tax procedures were passed in
tax efficiency.
2005 and implemented in January 2006. In April 2006
a customs law was adopted.
Reform the civil service.

The core civil service has been streamlined. Reforms
are being extended to the entire civil service.

Strengthen financial intermediation and
bank soundness.

On the basis of action plans drafted with the National
Bank of Rwanda (NBR), five of six commercial banks
have been brought into compliance with prudential
regulations and agreement has been reached on
restructuring the remaining problem bank.
Amendments to the banking law to strengthen the
supervisory powers of the central bank were submitted
to parliament in September 2006.

Reform land tenure.

Parliament in July 2005 approved a land law conferring
security of tenure and user rights; subordinate
legislation and regulations are being drafted. The law
will be implemented through a consultative process
over several years.

Privatize public commercial enterprises.

The telecommunications carrier, Rwandatel, was
privatized in June 2005; majority shares of two banks
were sold to foreign investors in December 2004; and
the largest coffee exporter and three tea factories
(among others) were privatized.

Nonetheless, poverty is still pervasive. The living standards of the poor are well
below those in other members of the East African Community (EAC). While Rwanda has
already met three MDG goals (immunization, reduction of HIV/AIDS prevalence, and
elimination of the gender gap in primary education), the World Bank believes that if it is to
achieve the rest, it will require substantial additional funding. It is unlikely that some goals
can be met, particularly that of halving the proportion of people living on less than
US$1 a day (Appendix II).

The UN HDI ( Human Development Index) measures achievements in human development by taking into account life expectancy at
birth, the adult literacy rate, the combined primary, secondary and tertiary gross school enrolment ratio, and the GDP per capita. The
higher the score, the better the situation in a country.
2
The UN HPI (Human Poverty Index) is designed for developing countries. The HPI measures deprivations in human development by
taking into account the probability at birth of not surviving to age 40, the adult literacy rate, lack of access to water, and the percentage of
underweight children. The higher the score, the worse the situation in a country.

3.
The question now is how to increase real growth so as to reduce poverty. The
catch-up effect following the genocide has been waning in recent years and per capita growth
has fallen to only 2 percent per year. Growth at this rate cannot bring the next generation out
of poverty.
II. THE MEDIUM TERM—STIMULATING GROWTH
4.
The Article IV consultation concentrated on how to boost growth. To make
headway in halving poverty by 2015 notwithstanding high population growth, real GDP
growth must be about doubled. This will require raising total factor productivity growth by
investing in human and physical capital and further advancing structural reforms.
Discussions thus centered on obstacles to growth, enhancing competitiveness, and, with

8
Rwanda expected to be among the first recipients of scaled-up aid, the macroeconomic
challenges that scaling up would bring.
A. Removing Obstacles to Growth
5.
General consensus on the main obstacles to growth exists.1 After consultations
earlier in 2006 in the context of an evaluation of the PRSP implementation, stakeholders now
generally agree on obstacles to growth. Macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability are
recognized as prerequisites for strong growth, but the discussions also reflected increasing
recognition that, until Rwanda’s severe infrastructure gap is addressed, progress toward its
medium-term objectives will be limited. This recognition is expected to become the main
theme of the PRSP update planned for 2007. There is also consensus that security concerns
in the Great Lakes region are undermining investor confidence.

Private sector activity in Rwanda is hampered by weak infrastructure,
high cost of doing business, and human resource constraints.

Governance was not considered an impediment even though the recent World Governance Indicators show a
substantial deterioration in Rwanda’s score for 2005. Donors and private sector representatives expressed

7.
The energy supply is expensive and limited. Costly diesel generators provide more
than half of Rwanda’s electricity and tariffs are the highest in the region. Businesses also
suffer from frequent outages beyond the very limited supply. The Lake Kivu project3 and a
heavy-fuel-oil generator are expected to replace diesel power; and the authorities are also
building new hydropower plants and implementing strategies to preserve alternative energy
sources, such as wood fuel. Staff welcomed these activities and expected that they would
mitigate pressures on the medium-term current account by reducing oil imports.
8.
Transportation links are minimal. High transportation costs and slow routes both
internally and through Tanzania and Kenya severely constrain Rwanda’s access to markets,
though the domestic road network is being improved and Rwanda is expected to benefit from
regional efforts to rehabilitate key corridors, such as the World Bank’s East Africa Trade and
Transport Facilitation project. Nonetheless, some officials felt that Rwanda should give more
attention to developing its Information and Communications Technology and services sectors
to circumvent transportation constraints.

10.
Doing business is expensive. Rwanda scores high on ease of starting a business and
enforcing contracts, but it lags behind in almost all other categories of the World Bank’s cost
of doing business report.5 The authorities have appointed a task force to address these
weaknesses and also expected the business environment to improve because the legal system
is being overhauled and a land law implemented (¶29, MEFP). Private sector representatives
complained about the tax burden and sometimes heavy-handed enforcement. While
acknowledging that the tax system is generally sound, staff emphasized that the tax
administration’s onus should be on widening the tax net to the informal sector and ensuring
that tax laws are applied evenly and fairly. It welcomed the increase in the revenue ratio in
recent years, but emphasized that the planned export processing zone (to be financed by an
AfDB grant) should be ringfenced to prevent tax leakage.
11.
There is a shortage of qualified staff. Private sector representatives underscored
that the small pool of skilled labor is a major bottleneck; they echoed the authorities’ view
(and the findings of the Ex Post Assessment) that capacity constraints hamper progress.
While the authorities felt that the labor problem should be addressed by boosting tertiary
education, donors advocated for a focus on primary and secondary education. Staff suggested
that the on-the-job training for public accountants could serve as a model to build expertise
in other areas.
12.
Prioritizing policies will be a challenge. Some officials and private sector
representatives felt that Rwanda’s infrastructure gap should be tackled first. Other officials
and some donors argued that the social and the agricultural sectors should have priority to
reduce poverty and ensure food security and social peace. Staff stressed that further research
was needed on how different policies affect growth and poverty. It also noted the need to
assess the macroeconomic implications of spending to gauge whether it would give rise to
pressures for an appreciation of the real effective exchange rate (REER) (¶16).
B. Enhancing Competitiveness
13.
Trade integration is fundamental to Rwanda’s development strategy. Involving
subsistence farmers in trade could significantly reduce poverty and help diversify the
economy, and broadening Rwanda’s small export base would enhance its capacity to carry
external debt and finance development.

5

Rwanda placed 158 (of 175 countries) in both the 2006 and 2007 World Bank Doing Business reports.

12
14.
Improvements in competitiveness will depend on structural reforms. While the
REER is considerably more depreciated than before the genocide, it has started to appreciate.
Because the fact that exports did not respond to the depreciation suggests that nonprice
barriers are the main obstacle to trade, trade would be best fostered through sectoral export
promotion strategies (¶27, MEFP) and the removal of structural bottlenecks. Authorities and
staff considered the current level of the REER to be broadly in line with fundamentals and
not a problem for competitiveness. There was also consensus that macro policies had to be
geared to mitigating pressures for further appreciation that might arise from a scaling up
(¶18).

180
Over the long run, Rwanda's actual and equilibrum REERs have
depreciated (1990=100).1

Movements in Rwanda's REER have been consistent
with those in most neighboring countries (1990=100).

Trade arrangements could further boost Rwanda’s exports. Rwanda’s joining the
EAC is commendable; staff welcomed the reduction in Rwanda’s average tariffs resulting
from the adoption of EAC’s common external tariff and emphasized the scope membership
offers for leveraging improvements in regional infrastructure and the business climate
(¶25, MEFP). In response to staff concerns that higher EAC tariffs on some food items could
adversely affect the poor, the authorities said they would raise this, as well as possible
revenue losses and the protection of some industries, in the negotiations for a customs union.
They also noted a possible conflict between a customs union with the EAC scheduled for
2008 and COMESA scheduled for 2009 (Rwanda is a COMESA member). While the
authorities are not pursuing bilateral trade arrangements, they are progressing toward an
Economic Partnership Agreement with the European Union. Staff recommended that
Rwanda also make more use of its eligibility for the U.S. African Growth and Opportunity
Act.
C. Boosting Growth—A Scenario for Scaling-Up
16.
Scaled-up aid would accelerate Rwanda’s progress toward the MDGs. The
financing needs are massive: while the full costs of reaching the MDGs are not known, the

13
World Bank puts the price for achieving the health and education goals at more than
5 percent of GDP per year. Budget support in 2007 will be higher than before (by at least
1 percent of GDP) from the AfDB, the Fast Track Education Initiative, and two donors (the
Netherlands and Germany), who had, so far, provided only project support. Further scaling
up is possible in the medium term through, e.g., the U.S. Millennium Challenge Account.
However, the order of magnitude and timing of scaling up are uncertain.
17.
Scaled-up aid would also bring macroeconomic challenges. Spending the scaledup aid generates an increase in demand, which would put upward pressure on prices and the
real exchange rate. Inflationary pressures would be mitigated to the extent that some of the
higher spending was on imports or if there were a supply response in the economy. To best
deal with these pressures, Rwanda would thus need to raise absorption of imports by
allowing the nominal exchange rate to appreciate, and reduce obstacles to growth. Staff
highlighted the challenges through an illustrative scenario (Box 2). The authorities thought
the scenario would provide useful guidance for the PRSP update. Staff stressed that dialogue
with stakeholders is necessary to generate ownership and ensure that policies achieve their
intended purpose, and that budgets should be embedded in a medium-term framework.
18.
More flexibility in the exchange rate is crucial if Rwanda is to absorb more aid
and manage a likely real appreciation. While the NBR is committed to a flexible exchange
rate, the exchange rate has in fact behaved like a conventional fixed peg. Staff reiterated that
a peg was not the best exchange regime, particularly if aid is scaled up. To avoid rekindling
inflation or costly sterilization through domestic debt,6 domestic spending should be
sterilized predominantly by the sale of foreign exchange to raise absorption. Staff noted that
a gradual approach in allowing a nominal appreciation was appropriate, given that exports
would be adversely affected by exchange rate volatility. However, it saw a need for Rwanda
to accelerate foreign exchange sales to prevent a build up of domestic debt. While agreeing
that the exchange rate should be more flexible, the authorities expressed concern about the
possibility that the appreciation of the exchange rate might reverse if aid inflows slowed.
Staff responded that strong policy implementation would lessen the risk of a reversal of aid
flows.

Box 2. Scaled-Up Macroeconomic Framework
The scenario outlined in the selected issues paper assumes that growth would be boosted to
8½ percent, halving poverty by 2020. It highlights how the main macroeconomic challenges of
scaling up can be addressed:

•

To gradually increase the demand for domestic goods and services shift the composition of
expenditures. Initially, the impact of aid flows on the real exchange rate would be mitigated
by the need to front-load public investment (which is import-intensive) to address Rwanda’s
infrastructure gap. Over the medium term, capital spending would be gradually reduced to
make room for higher recurrent social spending, which would correspondingly increase
domestic demand.
To keep debt sustainable finance the development effort mostly through grants.
To move beyond aid dependence gradually raise revenue, invest in human capital, and
increase domestic savings.

•
•

The scaled-up aid would initially finance large infrastructure
projects and part of recurrent spending…..

.... but an increase in the revenue ratio will eventually
replace aid.

Delivery of public services will also have to be strengthened.

•

Public expenditure management. To implement the Organic Budget Law, the
authorities have created an action matrix (¶18, MEFP). While the matrix is a step in
the right direction, staff urged the authorities to tackle current weaknesses more
systematically, such as looking at their interaction with other reforms, including
decentralization. The decentralization process in turn warranted close monitoring.

15
•

Civil service reform. The authorities recognized the need to resist wage pressures
stemming from wage increases for the core civil service in 2006.7 Staff regretted the
delay in the wage review (end-2006 benchmark), which is important to guide wage
policy in the medium term (¶16, MEFP). It acknowledged that some pay increase
(possibly hinging on performance contracts) might be needed to retain qualified staff.
Though it would be justifiable to increase the wage bill to hire more teachers or
health workers, staff cautioned about using a scaling up to raise the wages of current
public employees.

Fiscal policy was tighter than programmed by about 0.75 percent of GDP in the first
half of 2006, because revenue overperformed due to the inclusion of fringe benefits in
the income tax. While expenditures were on track, their import component was less

than expected. Moreover, delay in the Lake Kivu project meant that priority spending
was slightly below target.8 All end-September targets were met.
•

Reserve money was within the end-June and end-September program limits, but
o Management of monetary policy was complicated by a rapid expansion in
private sector credit (by 26 percent year-on-year in September) and broad
money. While most of the increase appears to be demand-driven, some banks
may be lowering their lending standards.

o Net international reserves exceeded the targets primarily because foreign
exchange sales were lower than programmed, tracking lower foreign
exchange demand from the budget. To keep reserve money within the
program limits, the NBR resorted to sterilization using domestic
instruments—implying an increase in domestic debt through September
compared with year-end 2005. At the same time, the REER continued to
appreciate (5 percent in the first three quarters of 2006).

Without this technical delay, the end-June target for priority spending would have been met. The delay has
been resolved, but there may be further delays because the project relies on a unique, not yet fully proven
technology.

All but two performance criteria (PCs) for the first review have been met. All
quantitative end-June PCs were met except for the floor on priority spending. On the
structural side, the September PC on submission of the banking law and three benchmarks
(on public expenditure management, debt management, and private sector development)
were met. The second element of the August PC on monitoring project accounts has been
implemented as a prior action (Table 7 and MEFP Table 3). As a long-term solution to the
management of the state-owned Prime Holdings company’s two hotels, a 30-year lease
contract was signed with an international hotel chain.
B. The Medium-Term Framework
23.
Given uncertainties related to scaling up, the medium-term macroeconomic
framework takes a cautious view about aid. Aligned with the one in the previous staff
report (Country Report No. 06/245), it envisages a real growth rate of 4–5 percent, inflation
of 5 percent, and international reserves of at least 4 months of imports. While the authorities
expected real growth to exceed the program levels, they felt that the program should be
anchored on prudent assumptions to minimize policy mistakes; adjustments could be made
during a review. In light of the risks of weather-related shocks, the program will continue to
accommodate food imports in case there is an emergency.

C. Macroeconomic Policies
24.
Preserving macroeconomic stability while accommodating scaled-up aid is the
primary macroeconomic challenge. With indications for a real appreciation already
appearing in 2006, managing the domestic demand impact of fiscal policies will become all
the more important with the scaling up expected in 2007.
Program for 2006
25.
Despite additional spending, the fiscal targets are achievable. The authorities plan
to spend an additional 0.4 percent of GDP in 2006 on the interest bill, replenishing fuel
stocks, and reimbursing depositors in the closed microfinance institutions. These items
would be more than covered by the revenue overperformance. However, if the African Union
(AU) continues to delay reimbursing Rwanda for peacekeeping efforts in Darfur, the net
domestic financing target for 2006 might be missed.

19
26.

Risks to the monetary program will need to be reduced by

•

Keeping the monetary stance tight. Staff welcomed the NBR’s decision not to loosen
monetary policy despite an upward revision in growth. The recent inspections of
commercial banks that had substantially increased credit was timely and should be
continued to monitor the quality of banks’ portfolio. However, staff expressed
concern about the NBR working around the monetary program by allowing reserve
money to exceed end-quarter targets during the quarter. It urged the authorities to
mop up the liquidity so as to not further fuel private sector credit. Staff also felt that
the 2006 inflation target of 5 percent was not likely to be met. The authorities agreed,
but they expect inflation to decline in the coming months. They were not overly
concerned with excess liquidity during the quarter and the increase in private sector
credit, given strengthened banking supervision. Should inflationary pressures persist,
they are ready to tighten their stance, and also agreed to reduce excess liquidity
during the quarter. In the meantime, developments in inflation and private sector
credit would be closely monitored in coordination with staff.

•

Following through with the agreed intervention strategy. Should the foreign
exchange demand from the budget stay low, staff expressed concern about possible
costly sterilization operations to mop up the liquidity from higher domestic fiscal
spending. Thus, with continuing pressures for a real exchange rate appreciation,
absorption should be increased by stepping up foreign exchange sales. At the same
time, better analysis of the import component of the fiscal program would facilitate
monetary management. The authorities responded that they are trying to increase the
import component of the budget and improve its measurement, and felt that changes
to the auction system (¶21, MEFP) would stimulate foreign exchange sales. Some
officials also thought that commercial banks were resisting an appreciation, because
they had net open positions. Staff recommended setting up a forum for discussion
with banks to overcome their resistance.

Program for 2007
27.
The program contains a safeguard to manage a possible further real
appreciation from higher budget spending. Acknowledging large development needs, the
program allows for an increase in the deficit (excluding spending on peacekeeping and
demobilization) by about 1 percent of GDP. This increase is primarily for investment and is
partially financed by a drawdown of reserves, given the comfortable reserve position. Grants
are likely to be higher than programmed. However, the program would accommodate further
expansion in the deficit only after a review establishes that the expansion would not lead to

20
a rekindling of inflation or an undue increase in domestic debt.9 Staff cautioned that, without
medium-term scaling up, the increase in spending would be one off and there could be a need
for fiscal adjustment in 2008. Financing the budget by drawing down reserves is not
sustainable.
28.
This safeguard is also important because the authorities plan to accelerate
project spending. Project spending is not included in the definition of the domestic deficit
and thus not limited by the program (unless debt-financed, ¶31) because it is difficult to
monitor. Although projects generally have a relatively high import component, accelerated
spending could exacerbate pressures for a real appreciation. This is particularly important as
unused project disbursements of almost 5 percent of GDP were accumulated by endSeptember 2006,10 likely reflecting absorptive constraints. The program envisages some
draw down of project deposits during 2007, but, to better gauge spending pressures, staff
welcomed an analysis of what had prevented the disbursement from being spent
(¶17, MEFP). It also urged the authorities to integrate project spending into future budgets.
2007 Budget
29.
The authorities will keep the revenue ratio at its 2006 level despite some revenue
losses (¶13, MEFP). Several measures are planned to offset losses from reducing the
corporate tax rate and abolishing a warehouse fee (applicable to all imports). The latter was
particularly welcome because the fee had worked as a hidden tariff. Staff commented that
there was further scope for raising petroleum excises, given that pump prices were lower in
Rwanda than in Burundi and Uganda.
30.
Discussions on the 2007 budget focused on expenditure composition (¶14, MEFP
for a more detailed presentation). Staff stressed that it would have been easier to assess the
budget if it had been embedded into a medium-term expenditure framework.
•

9

Priority spending11 will increase by at least 1½ percent of GDP, directed to enhancing
access to water and energy, improving the quality of teaching to address low school
completion rates, and establishing land offices to implement the new land law
(see Box 3).

Additional spending of about 2 percent of GDP is already identified for education under the Fast Track
Initiative (1 percent of GDP) and for so called “contingent spending,” which would be allocated in equal
proportion to priorities and nonpriorities.
10
This accumulation took place over several years.
11
Development priorities as identified in the PRSP; “nonpriority” spending is the residual, but nonetheless
essential for the provision of basic public and social services.

21
•

“Nonpriority” spending would decline slightly compared to 2006, reflecting mostly
across-the-board restraint. This would allow for new spending in such areas as social
cohesion (courts for those accused of genocide, refugee repatriation, and prison
feeding); and administrative matters (opening embassies in Sudan and the
Netherlands, issuing new identity cards, setting up arbitration courts and the
accountant general’s office, and rehabilitating laboratories for quality control). If
there is a further expansion in the deficit, nonpriority spending would increase across
the board.
Box 3. Use of MDRI Relief
MDRI relief resulted in a reduction in Rwanda’s debt by more than US$1 billion.
However, except for the relief from the IMF, the net gain with lower disbursements
financing part of the relief is expected to be small.
For 2007 the authorities will allocate the MDRI relief to the water and energy
sectors.

Specific major expenditure items (¶15, MEFP):

•

Electricity subsidy. Because electricity tariffs are the highest in the region and a
further increase could stifle economic activity, the budget specifies a temporary
subsidy of about 0.5 percent of GDP until a more efficient generator becomes
operational (expected by the end of 2007).

•

Military spending. While military spending is expected to decline in 2007 to
2.4 percent of GDP, there was an unprogrammed increase in 2006 (to 2.5 percent of
GDP from 2.3 percent of GDP in 2004), when wages for conscripts were increased.

22
The authorities decided not to increase wages for military professionals and officers
in 2007 in response to donor concern.
•

AU peacekeeping. The authorities intend to continue peacekeeping efforts in Darfur,
but would recall their troops if reimbursements do not materialize. So far, outlays of
about 0.7 percent of GDP have had to be financed from budgetary resources.

Debt
32.
The authorities want to tightly limit debt financing. With IDA expected to provide
grants in 2007 rather than loans and a sustainable pick up in export receipts in 2006,
Rwanda’s debt sustainability indicators are slightly more favorable than at the last review.
Nonetheless, starting in 2014 the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio would exceed the 150 percent
threshold. Given the vulnerabilities associated with a narrow export base, the authorities feel
strongly about not exceeding the threshold and have crafted a borrowing strategy that would
limit the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio to below 125 percent over the long term. Consistent
with this intention, the program introduces new indicative targets on the net present value of
external debt to limit the contracting of concessional loans. Staff welcomed the authorities’
commitment to contain borrowing, but pointed out that staying within these limits would to a
large extent depend on whether multilaterals, which account for most of Rwanda’s aid,
would continue to provide grants.

D. Structural Reforms
33.

The focus of structural conditionality is broadly unchanged (Table 3, MEFP).

•

Public expenditure management. Emphasis will be on the implementation of the
Organic Budget Law and the reconciliation of bank statements.

•

Poverty reduction. To better target policies, the authorities will formulate detailed
community poverty profiles.

•

Financial sector reform. The priority here is to strengthen NBR’s supervision of
microfinance institutions. The medium-term agenda will be discussed at a donors’
meeting (¶9).

•

Private sector development. To improve property registration (which, through
collateralization, is expected to improve access to financial services), the authorities
will establish an office to register land titles.
E. Data Issues

34.
Although economic data are generally adequate for surveillance, weaknesses
hamper economic analysis. Weaknesses permeate all areas, but particular focus is needed
on improving national accounts and price statistics, government finance, and balance of
payments statistics.
F. Program Risks and Monitoring
35.
Program risks have increased. The main risk is that the monetary program could go
off track if the NBR resists a nominal exchange rate appreciation. Weak administrative
capacity could delay structural reforms, and a new risk has emerged on the security front:
Rwanda may have to cope with refugees from Tanzania, which has started to expel
Rwandese, or from Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo, should the political
situation deteriorate there. Finally, medium-term program funding could be affected by
Rwanda recently breaking off its diplomatic relations with France in response to the
accusations of a French judge that several high-ranking Rwandese officials were involved in
the 1994 assassination of President Habyarimana.
36.
Program monitoring for 2007 is described in the MEFP (¶¶30 and 31) and the
technical memorandum of understanding. The program design is generally the same, but
an indicative target on the NPV of external debt was added.

24
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
Rwanda is at a crossroads. The country has come a long way since the genocide: it
has achieved macroeconomic stability, it is continuing with social rehabilitation, and it is
making progress toward the MDGs. The challenge now is to make the best use of resources,
including scaled-up aid, to boost long-term growth, which has been lackluster in recent years,
and make inroads in poverty reduction.
38.
Now that the major obstacles to growth are identified—low agricultural yields,
severe infrastructure gap, an underdeveloped financial system, and high costs of doing
business—the focus should move to prioritization. To help with sequencing reforms, staff
encourages the authorities to engage in more dialogue with stakeholders and better research
the link between policies and poverty reduction and growth. It also underscores the critical
role of the agricultural strategy for food security and social cohesion.
39.
With Rwanda benefiting from scaled-up aid, the centerpiece of the program will
be management of the domestic demand impact of fiscal policies. A widening of the
budget deficit and possible acceleration in project spending in 2007 could intensify pressures
for real exchange rate appreciation that appeared in 2006. Thus, staff urges the authorities to
step up sales of foreign exchange and allow more exchange rate flexibility so as to avoid
costly domestic sterilization and a rekindling of inflation.
40.
The 2007 budget is an important milestone in Rwanda’s development. The
expenditure composition is appropriate with increased allocations for priorities, particularly
investments in the water and energy sectors, which are consistent with Rwanda’s
development objectives. Looking forward, staff urges the authorities to embed their policies
in a medium-term expenditure framework.
41.
Monetary policy must bring inflation back to single digits. The increase in private
sector credit is generally encouraging but staff is concerned about inflation. Unless inflation
is set solidly on a downward path, the authorities must keep the monetary stance tight and
continue to scrutinize private sector credit.
42.
A range of reforms is designed to improve public service delivery. The public
expenditure management action plan is promising but reforms need to be considered in a
broader context. Better monitoring of project accounts is especially important, given their
macroeconomic relevance. The intention of the authorities to strengthen debt management
and limit debt financing is commendable. The authorities should also enhance training to
address capacity constraints. While tax administration has improved substantially, increases
in the revenue ratio should come from widening the tax net to the informal sector.
43.
The efforts to improve the investment climate are welcome. Recent steps to
augment Rwanda’s electricity supply, improve commercial bank soundness, and overhaul

25
business-related laws are commendable, and EAC membership could leverage regional
improvements in the business climate and infrastructure. These and sectoral export
promotion strategies are expected to enhance Rwanda’s competitiveness, but the authorities
might be well-advised to make more use of trade arrangements. Staff looks forward to
discussing with the authorities medium-term financial sector reforms.
44.
The 2003 safeguards assessment has been updated and staff encourages the
authorities to address remaining vulnerabilities.
45.
Staff recommends that the requested waivers be granted—their nonobservance
was temporary—and that the first review of the PRGF arrangement be completed.
46.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Rwanda be held in
accordance with the decision on consultation cycles approved on July 15, 2002.

A negative number implies a discrepancy that is consistent with an underestimation of financing.

Actual data for 2005 exclude Rf8.5 billion expenditures for peacekeeping operations, which were not covered by grants. The domestic deficit excluding grant-financed peace keeping would have been 5 percent of GDP in 2005. For 2006, peacekeeping operations
of up to Rf 7.3 billion might not be covered by grants.

A negative sign indicates a reduction.

Converted at the program exchange rate: for 2005: RF 566.9/US$; for 2006: RF 553.7/US$ and RF 549.9/US$ for 2007.
The IMF's MDRI reduced foreign liabilities at the NBR by RF 42.4 million with a counter entry in government deposits (in January 2006).
The definition of reserve money as performance criterion or structural benchmark differs from the definition in the monetary program in that it excludes the deposits of a defunct

savings bank, import deposits, and dormant accounts. It includes old notes demonetized at the end of 2004 but in circulation until the end of 2005.
The PC and indicative targets refer to the last day of the period.
4
From December 2005 onward, includes Caisse Hypothecaire du Rwanda (BHR) deposits (RF 1 billion at end-2005).
5
End-September 2006 broad money includes RF 8 billion in foreign currency deposits for temporary repatriation of private investment, expected to unwind by December 2006.
6
Data from 2005 onward revised to reflect corrections to the formula. Country Report 06/245 should have shown 5.6 for 2006.

Broad money plus deposits in the Union de Banques Populaires de Rwanda (UBPR) and Rwanda Development Bank (BRD).

APPENDIX I—RWANDA: LETTER OF INTENT
Kigali, January 10, 2007
Mr. Rodrigo de Rato y Figaredo
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
U.S.A.
Dear Mr. de Rato:
1.
The Government of Rwanda is implementing a financial and economic program
supported under the Fund’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), which was
approved by the Executive Board on June 5, 2006. We hereby transmit the Memorandum of
Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP), which reviews recent economic developments and
progress in the implementation of our program in the first half of 2006; and sets out policies
the Government intends to pursue in the remainder of 2006 and 2007.
2.
Program implementation under the PRGF arrangement has been broadly on track. All
quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets for end-June 2006 were met with the
exception of the performance criterion (PC) on priority spending. The latter was affected by
technical difficulties in the Lake Kivu methane gas project for electricity generation, which
resulted in a spending delay. With these difficulties now resolved, about half of the spending
was effected in September and the other half will be effected in December. With an
acceleration in other priority spending, the end-September target on priority spending was
met and we also expect to meet the end-December target. On the structural front, the endSeptember 2006 PC on the submission to parliament of amendments to the banking law was
met. However, issuing the first quarterly report of a monitoring system of project accounts,
an end-August 2006 PC, was delayed. It was implemented on January 9 as a prior action. As
the nonobservance of both performance criteria was of a temporary nature, we are requesting
waivers for the nonobservance of the quantitative PC on priority spending and the structural
PC on the issuance of the report on the monitoring of project accounts.
3.
In support of our policies described in the MEFP, the Government of Rwanda
requests the completion of the first review under the PRGF arrangement and the
disbursement of the second loan of SDR 1.14 million.
4.
The Government of Rwanda believes that the policies set forth in the attached MEFP
are adequate to achieve the objectives of its program, but it will take any further measures
that may become appropriate for this purpose. The Government of Rwanda will consult with

38
the Fund on the adoption of these measures and in advance of revisions to the policies
contained in the MEFP, in accordance with the Fund’s policies on such consultations.
5.
The Government of Rwanda authorizes the publication and distribution of this letter
and MEFP together with the related staff report.

Sincerely yours,
/s/
François Kanimba
Governor
National Bank of Rwanda

Technical Memorandum of Understanding

39
APPENDIX I—ATTACHMENT I
RWANDA: MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMICS AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
(January 10, 2007)
1.
Rwanda’s medium-term economic program is supported by an arrangement
under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility over 2006-2009. We are committed to
reducing poverty through preserving macroeconomic stability, boosting economic growth,
and implementing policies targeted at improving the livelihood of the poor. This
memorandum is consistent with the goals established in the Poverty Reduction and Strategy
Paper and three annual progress reports. The memorandum reviews the recent performance
under the program and describes the policies and targets for the remainder of 2006 and 2007.
I. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
2.
Growth remains strong, but inflation has been rising. GDP growth is expected to
exceed 4 percent in 2006, owing to buoyant activity in manufacturing as well as the services
and financial sectors, which are offsetting a decline in agricultural production. 12-month endof-period inflation has increased to 11 percent in November, owing mostly to increased food
and energy prices, but annual average inflation in November was at 8.3 percent.
3.

The fiscal program has remained broadly on track through September 2006.

•

Fiscal policy in the first half of 2006 was tighter than programmed because of strong
revenue. Revenue over performed by about ¾ percent of GDP, reflecting mostly an
increase in payroll-related taxes due to a widening of the tax net and a broadening of
the tax base to fringe benefits. With overall spending broadly in line with the
program, the end-June targets on the domestic deficit was met by a wide margin.1
However, technical delays in the Lake Kivu project led a postponement of the
spending, and thus end-June priority spending was below its target by 0.1 percent of
GDP.2

•

Preliminary data for September point to continuing revenue buoyancy. Thus, despite
some unforeseen outlays, the September target on the domestic deficit was met (as
were the ones on priority spending and arrears clearance). The end-September target
on the net credit to government was met by a small margin. However, a discrepancy
of about Rf 10 billion with revenue and expenditure data indicate that this reflected
that expenditure released to budgetary agencies was not yet effected.

1

Also the end-June target on domestic arrears clearance was met.

2

Without this delay, the end-June target would have been met.

40
4.
While the reserve money targets for end-June and end-September 2006 were
met, monetary management was rendered difficult because of:
•

A larger-than-programmed domestic spending component of the budget. The
National Bank of Rwanda (NBR) could not step up the sales of foreign exchange
sufficiently to keep reserve money within the program limits and thus had to resort to
sterilization using domestic instruments. As a result, consolidated domestic debt
stayed broadly at its end-2005 level (instead of being reduced as envisaged under the
program) and net international reserves exceeded both the end-June and endSeptember targets.

•

A large increase in broad money, owing mostly to an increase in private sector
credit.3 Credit increased by 26 percent (year-on year) in September, pushing broad
money well beyond the indicative target (by 8 percent).

5.
The external current account is expected to be tighter than programmed. This
reflects mostly lower-than-programmed government imports during January-September, and
the NBR’s increased sterilization of government spending through domestic instruments.
Exports are projected to slightly exceed projections, due to higher volumes in coffee and tea.
The nominal exchange rate depreciated by 1.5 percent during January-September, while
there was a 5 percent appreciation in the real effective exchange rate .
6.

Substantial progress has been made on the structural front.

•

To bring banking supervision in line with international best practice, amendments to
the banking law were submitted to Parliament in September (performance criterion).
Moreover, in June 2006, the NBR closed 9 mismanaged Microfinance Institutions
(MFIs), which had experienced significant deposit withdrawals. To help stabilize the
situation and avoid contagion, we reimbursed deposit holders for half of their net
deposits (about 0.1 percent of GDP) and appointed the Union des Banques Populaires
(UBPR) to administer the recovery of outstanding loans.

•

To enhance public financial management, guidelines for undertaking bank
reconciliations and accounting for government agencies were issued in mid-2006
(end-October benchmark). To improve the monitoring of project accounts (endAugust performance criterion), the backward-looking part on historical quarterly
disbursements and expenditures was completed on time, while the forward-looking
part on quarterly projections for January-December 2007 was implemented in

3

Broad money was also affected by a temporary large deposit of a repatriated private investment.

41
January (prior action). The Organic Budget Law (OBL) was gazetted in September
and its supporting financial regulations were approved by Cabinet in October.
•

To facilitate decentralization, Cabinet approved the creation of a Decentralization
Unit in the Ministry of Finance in October.

•

To strengthen debt management, we have reconciled in September the debt databases
maintained by the Ministry of Finance and the NBR as at end-June 2006
(benchmark). The two institutions now maintain a unified database.

•

To improve the investment climate, Cabinet approved the draft laws on establishing a
commercial registration agency and on intellectual property in June (benchmark) and
the laws are now at parliament.

•

As a long-term solution to the management of Prime Holdings’ two hotels, a 30-year
lease contract has been signed with an international hotel chain.
II. MEDIUM-TERM STRATEGY

7.
As outlined in our MEFP of May 2006, our medium-term strategy is based on
the following pillars, which will also be reflected in the new PRSP (expected to be
finalized in the first half of 2007):
•

Removing obstacles to private sector development to make it the engine of growth.
To this end, we will continue building human capital through better health and
education and address Rwanda’s poor infrastructure links, insufficient and expensive
energy supply, its shallow financial system, and high costs of doing business.

•

Enhancing agricultural development and trade as vehicles to empower the poor by
having them participate in economic activity.

•

Improving the delivery of public services through better expenditure management,
civil service reform, and better analyses of the links between policies and growth and
poverty reduction.

•

Relying on sustainable financing sources with an emphasis on grant financing and
raising the revenue ratio in the long run.

While our medium-term macroeconomic framework is based on prudent projections for
growth and external assistance, we believe that that steadfast implementation of our reform
agenda is likely to lead to substantially higher-than-projected growth and we also hope that it
could facilitate higher levels of external assistance. Moreover, to further improve the policy
dialogue with stakeholders and development partners, starting with the new PRSP, we will
maintain a rolling medium-term expenditure and macroeconomic framework.

42
III. POLICIES FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2006
8.
Despite unforeseen outlays, we expect to meet most end-2006 fiscal targets.
Revenue over performance is expected to more than cover unanticipated spending for
restocking the fuel reserve, a transfer to the deposit holders of the recently closed MFIs, and
a higher-than-anticipated domestic interest bill. However, if AU reimbursements of our
peacekeeping efforts continue to be delayed (see paragraph 15), it is possible that we will not
meet the end-2006 target on net credit to government.
9.
To prevent the recent credit expansion from fueling inflation, the NBR will
maintain a tight monetary policy. It will continue to monitor inflation and private sector
credit and stand ready to tighten the stance, if needed. Moreover, the NBR audited a bank,
which had shown a particularly large increase in the consumer credits. As this audit found
that the credits had not been provided with sufficient guarantees, the bank has now slowed
down the pace of granting new credits.
IV. THE PROGRAM FOR 2007
10.
Our policies in 2007 will continue to safeguard macroeconomic stability while
laying the base for stronger medium-term growth. They are based on a real growth rate of
4½ –6½ percent, keeping inflation at 5 percent, and a level of international reserves of at
least 4.3 months of imports. Macroeconomic and structural policies will focus on improving
the living standards of the poor, and growth-enhancing investments and reforms.
A. Macroeconomic Program
11.
Managing the domestic demand impact of fiscal policies will lie at the heart of
our macroeconomic policies. The domestic deficit (excluding spending on demobilization
and peace keeping) is projected to increase by about 1 percent of GDP compared with 2006,
financed by higher aid flows, but also some draw down of the NBR’s reserves. Thus,
pressures for a real exchange rate appreciation are expected to continue and could be
exacerbated by a likely drawdown of project accounts.4 To protect the monetary program and
ensure that fiscal policy is not crowding out investment, we will, if grants exceed program
projections, release any further spending (so called “contingent spending,” see paragraph 14)
only in the context of the second review under the PRGF of macroeconomic developments.

4

The programmed draw down of project deposits in 2006 (which stood at 5 percent of GDP at end-2005) did
not materialize until September 2006. We are now projecting a partial draw down during 2007.

43
Fiscal Policy
12.

Fiscal policy is guided by the following main considerations:5

•

On the revenue front, we will maintain the revenue-to-GDP ratio at its 2005 level of
15 percent of GDP, despite a revenue loss of almost ½ percent of GDP from the
removal of the Magerwa warehouse handling fees and a reduction in the corporate tax
rate. Our revenue measures are described in paragraph 13.

•

The focus on expenditure lies in increasing the share of priority spending in the
budget while improving the quality of public services. Given uncertainties related to
weather conditions, the program continues to include an adjuster allowing an increase
in the deficit and a commensurate reduction in net foreign assets for food imports
related to a food emergency.

2007 Budget
13.

With respect to revenue measures, we have:

•

Implemented a tax on mobile and fixed telephone usage (revenue gain of 0.1 percent
of GDP);

•

Increased the excise tax on cigarettes (revenue gain of about 0.1 percent of GDP);

•

Introduced licenses for importers (replacing part of the Magerwa loss; revenue gain
of about 0.1 percent of GDP);

•

Increased the reference price on petroleum (revenue gain of about 0.1 percent of
GDP).

These measures are expected to offset the revenue loss. In the case of a shortfall, we will
increase the reference prices for petroleum products. Moreover, on the basis of a survey on
the informal sector, we will study ways to increase our tax base in the medium term.
14.
The budget focuses on improving the living standards of our population while
boosting the economy’s productivity. Spending will increase by about 2 percent of GDP
and could increase further, including through the release of contingent spending of about
1 percent of GDP (half of which is for priorities) and spending for education through the Fast
5

While the budget submitted to Parliament was not fully in line with program understandings, amendments
were made during the budget discussions and the published budget is in line with the program.

44
Track Initiative of about 1 percent of GDP.6 In releasing contingent spending, we will ensure
that more than half is going to priorities (in particular rural terracing, the common
development fund, energy savings devices, forestation and road maintenance).

Priority spending will increase for both social sectors and enhancing the productivity
of the economy. An increase in the capitation transfers (i.e., funds provided per pupil)
by 60 percent will allow to improve the quality of teaching (see paragraph 15).
Moreover, the allocation to the water sector has increased substantially to provide
access to safe water to a larger part of the population. Allocations have also been
made to establish land offices in districts, which will start the registration of land
ownership (the titles could be used as collateral for bank lending). To address the
issue of limited and expensive electricity supply, we will continue financing the Lake
Kivu project, and start several hydropower electricity projects. The budget also
covers Electrogaz’s costs related to the rental of diesel generators and the fuel cost of
one of the diesel generators (of 5MW) to avoid a further increase in electricity tariffs,
which would adversely affect the private sector (see paragraph 15). These subsidies
will be for 2007 only as we expect a heavy fuel generator to become operational by
end-2007, which would replace some of the more expensive diesel generators. Part of
the increase in priority spending (about 0.5 percent of GDP) is financed through the

As long as additional grants are available, the program would allow an increase in spending beyond
contingent spending and the education spending if it is used for priorities.

Nonpriority spending would fall slightly as a percent of GDP (and increase by about
½ percent of GDP including contingent spending). This includes about 0.4 percent of
GDP for social cohesion (gacaca courts, genocide survivors, prison feeding,
repatriation of refugees), 0.6 percent of GDP for administrative issues (including 2
new important embassies, an increase in the transfer to the Rwanda Revenue
Authority, new identity cards, the establishment of the accountant general’s office
and arbitration courts, and the rehabilitation of laboratories for quality control), and
0.3 percent of GDP for ICT, feasibility studies, and new energy savings devices.
There also is a substantial decline in some one-off items compared with 2006.

On specific spending items:

•

AU peace keeping in Darfur. The AU had agreed to reimburse Rf 9.4 billion in
2006 for outlays related to peace keeping activities, but has, so far, provided only a
partial reimbursement of Rf 3.1 billion. While we would be willing to continue our
efforts, we are concerned that the ensuing financial burden would hamper our own
development and will thus review the situation by January 2007. To monitor the costs
associated with the peace keeping, the Auditor General will conduct an audit of the
spending in 2006 expenditures that will be published by end-March 2007.

47
•

Military spending. Military spending is about 2.4 percent of GDP due to an increase
in wages for conscripts,

to gradually reduce the share of students with scholarships to half by 2010. The
implementation plan will be completed by end-June 2007.

•

Capitation grant for primary education. The increase in the capitation grant will
allow districts to improve the quality of education by hiring more teachers and
providing districts and schools with more control of incentive schemes to reduce
teacher absenteeism. With respect to the latter, the ministry of education is designing
performance guidelines and contracts, which would be signed between districts and
schools. The capitation grants will stay at Rf 2,500 per pupil with the balance of
Rf1,500 to be released after contract signature.

•

Electricity tariff. We have adopted a structured tariff in October, which will be
implemented starting in January 2007. We will review by end-June 2007 the
subsidies to Electrogaz.7 If they are insufficient to ensure Electrogaz’ cost recovery in
2007, we stand ready to raise electricity tariffs. If the needed subsidy is smaller, the
savings will be allocated to the agricultural sector.

Fiscal structural reforms
16.
Civil service reform is proceeding. Parliament is reviewing a civil service law,
which regulates issues such as recruitment, grading, and promotion and we are also in the
process of developing performance standards for ministries and agencies. However, the
7

The size of the subsidy depends on the oil price and when the heavy fuel oil generator will become
operational.

48
review of the wage of the entire civil service, which was to be completed by end-December
2006 (benchmark) is now expected to be delayed to March 2007.
17.
To further enhance the monitoring of project accounts at the NBR, we will
complete a study and publish it on the Ministry of Finance’s website by end-September 2007
(1) showing annual budgets with donor disbursements and spending for 2004-2006 as well as
quarterly projections (including a breakdown into imports and the domestic component) for
July 2007-June 2008; and (2) providing an analysis of the causes for the large accumulation
of the specific project accounts since January 1, 2004 (performance criterion).
18.
Public Financial Management (PFM) reforms have been given further impetus
with the establishment of the PFM Steering Committee. A PFM Secretariat at the
Ministry of Finance is charged with coordinating, monitoring and evaluating reforms in
cooperation with our development partners, who are supporting us through a multi-donor
trust fund within the public sector capacity project. Pending the completion of a
comprehensive medium-term PFM agenda, expected to be finalized by June 2007, we have
developed an interim action matrix including:
•

Legal Framework. We plan to conduct by end-2006 workshops for senior and midlevel officials on the implementation of the OBL and its financial regulations. To
monitor and review implementation, a progress report on the OBL implementation
will be published in September 2007 (benchmark).

•

Reconciliation. Agencies have improved the reconciliation of their accounts after the
issuance of guidelines in mid-year, but some are still not compliant in submitting
their monthly statements. To improve reporting discipline, we wrote in October
letters reminding agencies of reporting requirements and indicating that their funds
could be cut withheld if they do not comply with the reporting requirements.
Acknowledging that further training is needed for budget managers to fully reconcile
all bank accounts, line ministries, provinces, and autonomous agencies will be
expected to produce the following monthly financial reports: (i) bank reconciliation
statement; (ii) budget execution reports, and (iii) statements of revenue and
expenditure. The first progress report on financial reporting by budget agencies
covering January to March 2007 will be finalized by mid-June 2007 (benchmark).

•

Public Accounts. We will produce as envisaged by March 2007 the consolidated
government financial statements for 2006. Moreover, to facilitate moving to a
treasury single account, we will close by end-June 2007 all dormant government
accounts in commercial banks.

•

Budget Preparation and Execution. In January 2007 we will begin work on
revising the economic and functional classification of the budget for implementation
by September 2008. We will also by March 2007, decentralize the authority to

49
ministries and districts to effect expenditure commitments and virements. Moreover,
line ministries, provinces, and autonomous agencies with extrabudgetary resources
will start producing quarterly reports on extrabudgetary resources received.
•

Development Planning. In collaboration with donors work has begun on
strengthening the performance-based budget. We will by end-December 2007
improve the capacity to undertake strategic planning, logical framework analysis and
costing activities. Additionally, by end-September 2007 we plan to produce a poverty
profile of provinces, districts, and communities of Rwanda using the results of the
census and the household living conditions survey (benchmark).

•

Public Procurement. If the Public Procurement Code and the law establishing the
Rwanda Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (RPPA) are adopted by end-2006,
the RPPA could be operational by March 2007 and, through recruitment and training,
procurement capacities could be established in budget agencies by end-2007 with
assistance from the World Bank.

Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
19.
The NBR will continue to use reserve money as the operational target to control
inflation. To maintain inflation at 5 percent, it will limit year-end reserve money growth to
13 percent, which would create room for an expansion of credit to the private sector. The
NBR will continue to follow closely inflationary developments and aggressively mop up
excess liquidity, in particular through sales of foreign exchange.
20.
We will allow more flexibility in the exchange rate. Acknowledging that an
increase in spending from higher aid flows in 2007 is likely to result in further pressures for a
real exchange rate appreciation, we will forcefully implement our intervention strategy. Our
interventions will accommodate upward pressures on the exchange rate through a nominal
appreciation by raising foreign exchange sales while smoothing short-term market
fluctuations. This will ensure that the execution of the 2007 budget does not rekindle
inflation or crowd out private investment.
21.
While NBR’s foreign exchange auction system serves Rwanda well, we have
started to prepare for a smooth transition to an interbank-based market. The NBR has
issued in June an instruction, which (1) improves auction procedures; and (2) abolishes
Article 10, which allowed the NBR to check whether the foreign exchange purchased at the
auction was used in accordance with regulations. We have also issued amendments to the
foreign exchange regulation that address further regulatory constraints and reduce reporting
requirements.

50
External Sector
22.
Owing to the increase in fiscal spending, we expect the external current account
deficit (excluding official transfers) to widen to more than 21 percent of GDP (by
almost 2 percent of GDP compared with 2006). Export receipts are projected to grow by at
least 7 percent, driven mainly by increased volumes of traditional exports owing to our
sectoral strategies (see paragraph 27). The expected increase in imports by more than 20
percent stems from an expansion in the fiscal deficit as well as a draw down of project
accounts and the Lake Kivu project.
23.
The implementation of debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative is at an
advanced stage. In addition to the IMF, IDA, and AfDB, completion point and topping up
assistance have been provided by BADEA and the OPEC Fund. IFAD, the Kuwait Fund, the
Saudi Fund and the EU have provided HIPC debt relief without topping up. Bilateral
agreements have now been signed with all Paris Club creditors. Regarding non-Paris Club
creditors, China has indicated a willingness to cancel all outstanding loans, while Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait noted the possibility of future debt relief. Debt owned to Libya and the
Abu Dhabi Fund continues to be passive.8
24.
Debt management will be strengthened through improved recording and
monitoring. A new debt recording system is expected to be in place by January 2007, with a
live link between the Treasury and the NBR. Moreover, we have introduced an indicative
target on the Net Present Value (NPV) of external debt for 2007, which will ensure that the
level of contracted debt remains sustainable and allow a review of the medium-term debt
profile (see technical memorandum of understanding, paragraphs 42-44).
25.
At end-November, Rwanda became a member of the East African Community
(EAC) and signed the protocol for a customs union.9 We expect that membership will
have a positive welfare effect by reducing import prices and also provide an opportunity to
promote regional development and address common issues, including infrastructure needs.
We will negotiate the terms of the treaty and customs union protocol during 2007 with
implementation envisaged by end-2008. Regarding other trade arrangements, negotiations
are ongoing on a customs union in the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA); and discussions have begun on an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA)
with the European Union, following the finalization of an impact study.

8

The last contact was in October 2006.
The Customs Union provides for the removal of duties and nontariff barriers among members and establishes
a three-band structure for its common external tariff of 0, 10, and 25 percent.

9

51
B. Structural Policies
26.
The focus on the structural side will remain on enhancing the productivity of the
agricultural and export sectors and improving the conditions for the private sector.
27.
Our export promotion strategy will continue to focus on enhancing the
productivity in the traditional sectors and diversifying our export base.
•

Coffee. Extension services are now available in most districts. To move into higher
value added markets, the number of washing stations will be further increased while
existing stations are being made more efficient.

•

Tea. To increase export volumes of the remaining state-owned farms, efforts aim at
reducing the cost of fertilizer, strengthening tea growing cooperatives, planting of
high yielding clones, and increasing acreage under cultivation. Meanwhile,
discussions are underway to accelerate privatization.

•

Tourism. Private operators are expected to open eight hotels and work focuses on
offering a one-week trip to extend the average stay of tourists. Moreover, a training
needs assessments for the hospitality industry will be undertaken by early 2007.

•

Export processing Zone (EPZ). The first phase of construction, which includes the
development of infrastructure, is expected to start in 2007. With respect to financing,
negotiations for a grant from the AfDB to the tune of US$22 million are ongoing.

Financial sector
28.
The agenda for medium-term financial sector reform, which will be coordinated
with donors in a meeting in early 2007, focuses on:
•

Strengthening NBR’s supervisory powers. In its supervision activities, the NBR
has been putting more emphasis on new banking products such as leasing (including
through on-the-spot inspections). We will submit to Cabinet by end-2006 a draft law
on Anti Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism.

•

Preventing a recurrence of the recent crisis in the MFI sector. We are in the
process of drafting the micro finance law and will be submitting it to parliament by
June 2007 (benchmark). The NBR will raise the minimum capital requirements
significantly for MFIs that take deposits other than for collateral only and increase
exposure limits for group loans. It will grant licenses only to MFIs with adequate
management.

•

Addressing the weaknesses of the payments system. The NBR will create by
March 2007 a unit that coordinates all elements related to payments system. We will

52
also by end-June 2007 reorganize and financially restructure SIMTEL with World
Bank technical assistance.
•

Developing long-term savings and insurances. To this end, we will draft an action
plan to define the legal framework for the regulation and supervision of insurances
and the contractual savings industries (including the Caisse Social du Rwanda); and
the introduction of government bonds.

•

Improving accounting standards. With a view to adopting IFRS (International
Financial Reporting Standards), we are in the process of establishing a training
program for accountants. Moreover, we will amend relevant tax laws to allow
companies to base tax returns on IFRS standards.

Cost of doing business
29.
To improve the business climate and remove the obstacles to business
development as identified in the World Bank’s cost of doing business index, we
•

Are in the process of drafting 14 business related laws. While five of these laws have
already been submitted to parliament, including a bankruptcy law, further laws will
follow in the course of the next years, including a contract law, an e-commerce law,
and a labor law.

•

Will set up by March 2007 a “Commercial Justice, Business, and Land Registration
Program” in partnership with the private sector, which will focus on key legal and
regulatory constraints to private sector development. This will include the fair and
speedy resolution of commercial disputes, including the establishment of Commercial
Courts, and the provision of key business registration services, particularly for land.

•

Will make operational by October 2007 the Office of the Registrar of Land Titles
(benchmark).

•

Will reduce the number of documents required for exports and imports by August
2007.
V. PROGRAM MONITORING

30.
Conditionality and program reviews. The second review under the PRGF
arrangement, scheduled for completion by May 30, 2007, will review quantitative
performance as of end-December 2006 and structural conditionality through end-March
2007. It will focus on expenditure management and financial sector reform. The second year
of the PRGF-supported program will be monitored through quantitative performance criteria
for end-June and end-December 2007 and indicative targets for end-March and endSeptember 2007, as well as quarterly quantitative indicators, that will be subject to the third

53
and fourth program reviews to be completed no later than end-November 2007 and end-May
2008 respectively. We have also set structural conditionality in public expenditure
management, private sector development, poverty reduction, and financial sector reforms.
31.
Technical memorandum of understanding (TMU). The attached TMU lays out the
details of the program design and terminology. We have maintained the broad design of the
program for 2006, but have added an indicative target on the net present value of external
debt to ensure that our debt remains sustainable.

APPENDIX I—ATTACHMENT II
RWANDA: TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
1.
This technical memorandum sets out the definitions for quantitative targets under
which Rwanda’s performance will be assessed and provides specifics on areas of structural
conditionality. Monitoring procedures and reporting requirements as well as other program
definitions are also specified.
I. QUANTITATIVE PROGRAM TARGETS
2.
Performance criteria for June 30, 2007 and December 31, 2007 as well as indicative
targets for March 31, 2007, and September 30, 2007 are proposed to be established with
respect to:
•

floors on the domestic fiscal balance of the central government (DFB);

•

ceilings on the net credit to the central government (NCG);

•

floors on priority spending;

•

ceilings on the net accumulation of domestic arrears of the central government;

•

floors on the Net Foreign Assets (NFA) of the National Bank of Rwanda (NBR);

•

ceilings on reserve money; and

•

ceilings on the outstanding stock of external debt with original maturities of one year
or less owed or guaranteed by the public sector.

3.
Performance criteria that are applicable on a continuous basis are proposed to be
established with respect to the ceilings on new external payment arrears of the public sector
and new nonconcessional debt of the public sector.
4.

Indicative targets are proposed to be established

•

for end-March 2007, end-June 2007 end-September 2007, and end-December 2007,
for ceilings on broad money and extended broad money;

•

for end-June 2007, and end-December 2007, for ceilings on the contracting or
guaranteeing of concessional external debt.

58
A. Institutional Definitions
5.

The central government comprises the treasury and line ministries.

6.
The public sector comprises the central government, local governments, public
enterprises (including Rwandatel, Electrogaz, Ocircafé, Ocirthé, Prime Holdings, and ONP),
and the NBR.
B. Targets related to the Execution of the Fiscal Program
Domestic Fiscal Balance of the Central Government (DFB)
7.
A floor applies to the DFB, which is measured cumulatively from December 31, 2006
for the end-March 2007, end-June, 2007, end-September 2007 and end-December 2007
targets.
8.
Definition. The domestic fiscal balance is defined as domestic revenue (excluding
grants) minus domestic spending. Domestic spending is defined as current expenditure
(excluding external interest due, spending related to Rwandese troops involved in the UN
peace-keeping efforts (Table 1), and spending related to the World Bank-led demobilization
and reintegration program) plus domestically-financed capital expenditure on a payment
order basis, plus net lending.
9.

Adjusters.

•

The floor on the DFB will be adjusted downward (i.e., the deficit target will be
increased) by the amount of the positive difference between actual and programmed
budgetary grants in the context of a review with Fund staff IF this review establishes
that a further fiscal expansion would not lead to a rekindling of inflation or an undue
increase in domestic debt. The increase in the deficit would be used for contingent
spending. A list of contingent spending of about one percent of GDP is provided in
Table 1; this contingent spending will be released equally for priority and nonpriority
spending. For example, if contingent spending of Rf 2 billion is released, at least Rf 1
billion should go to priority spending (so called contingent priority spending; see also
paragraph 17). Any further spending in addition to the one listed in Table 1 would be
for priorities only, including spending under the Fast Track Initiative for Education.1
Budgetary grants include HIPC Initiative-related grants,2 but exclude grants related to

1

In the following, the contingent priority spending plus any further unprogrammed priority spending financed
by additional grants will be referred to as “additional priority spending (see paragraph 17).”

2

HIPC grants exclude debt relief from IDA and the AfDB.

59
AU peace keeping activities and for the demobilization program as well as capital
grants related to the development budget. Quarterly programmed budgetary grants are
also provided in Table 2 of the MEFP.
•

The floor on the DFB will be adjusted upward (that is, the deficit target will be
reduced) by the amount actual grants are below programmed grants with a maximum
adjustment of up to US$20 million. Spending would be reduced in equal shares for
priority and nonpriority spending (see also paragraph 13).3

•

The floor on the DFB will be adjusted downward (i.e., the deficit target will be
increased) by the amount of expenditure deemed integral to a specific privatization
operation (to be recorded under net lending) IF the difference between privatization
revenue and this expenditure is positive (see also paragraph 13).

•

The floor on the DFB will be adjusted downward (i.e., the deficit target will be
increased) by the amount of expenditure for food imports in the case of a food
emergency (see also paragraphs 13 and 24).

10.
Reporting requirement. Data on the DFB and its adjusters will be transmitted, with
detailed explanations, on a monthly basis within four weeks of the end of each month.
Net Credit to the Central Government (NCG)
11.
A ceiling applies to the NCG, which is measured cumulatively from December 31,
2006 for the end-March 2007, end-June 2007, end-September 2007, and end-December 2007
targets.
12.
Definition. For program monitoring purposes, the NCG will be calculated as the
change from end-December 2006 of net credit from the banking system and the change of
holdings of treasury bills and other government securities by the nonbank sector. Net credit
from the banking system is defined as the difference between:
•

3

credit to government from the banking system, including credit to central
government, provinces and districts, outstanding central government debt
instruments; government debt to the NBR incurred as a result of the 1995 devaluation
(Rf 9 billion) and the overdraft to the prewar government (Rf 2 billion); and

Privatization receipts are recorded under nontax revenue.

60
•

total government deposits with the banking system of the central government,
including the main treasury account, line ministries, the fund for assistance to
genocide survivors, Rwanda Revenue Authority, the electoral commission, the
demobilization commission, fonds routier, and any other of the 15 autonomous
agencies. Thus, this definition excludes any government deposits, over which the
central government does not have any direct control (i.e., for project accounts,
counterpart funds, fonds publics affectés, and privatization proceeds with the NBR).4
In particular, NCG is not affected by credit to or deposits of public enterprises and
autonomous public agencies.

13.

Adjusters.

•

The ceiling on NCG will be adjusted upward by the amount of any negative
difference between actual and “baseline grants” (defined in Table 2 of the MEFP) up
to a maximum adjustor of US$30 million, evaluated in Rwanda francs at the program
exchange rate.

•

The ceiling on the NCG will be adjusted downward by the amount of privatization
revenue IF the difference between this revenue and any expenditure deemed integral
to the privatization operation is positive (see also paragraph 9).

•

The ceiling on the NCG will be adjusted upward by the amount of expenditure for
food imports in case of a food emergency (see also paragraph 9 and 24).

14.
Reporting requirement. Data on the NCG (showing separately treasury bills and
government bonds outstanding, other government debt, and central government deposits) and
its adjusters will be transmitted on a monthly basis within three weeks of the end of each
month. Deposits of the government with the NBR and with the commercial banks will be
separated from the deposits of the public enterprises and autonomous public agencies.
Priority Expenditure
15.
A floor applies to priority spending of the central government, which is measured
cumulatively from December 31, 2006 for the end-March 2007, end-June 2007, endSeptember 2007, and end-December 2007 targets.

4

The target excludes any transfers from the deposits over which the government has limited control into other
government deposits.

61
16.
Definition. Central government priority spending is defined as the sum of those
recurrent expenditures, domestically-financed capital expenditures, and net lending that the
government has identified as priority in line with the PRSP process. The definition of priority
expenditures is based on the program classification of the annual budget. Table 2 provides a
summary of the SIBET output5 and a list of the main programs.
17.

Adjuster.

•

The floor will be adjusted upward by additional priority spending (see paragraph 9,
footnote 1 for definition).

•

The floor will be adjusted downward by half of the amount actual grants are below
programmed grants with a maximum adjustment of up to US$10 million.

18.
Reporting requirement. Data on priority expenditure, at the same level of detail as
in Table 2, will be transmitted on a monthly basis within three weeks of the end of each
month.
Net Accumulation of Domestic Arrears of the Central Government
19.
A ceiling applies to the net accumulation of domestic arrears of the central
government, which is measured cumulatively from December 31, 2006 for the end-March
2007, end-June 2007, end-September 2007, and end-December 2007 targets.6
20.
Definition. The net accumulation of arrears is defined as the difference between the
gross accumulation of new domestic arrears (measured as the difference between payment
orders and actual payments related to payment orders issued) and gross repayment of any
arrears outstanding on December 31, 2006 (including repayment of float in 2006 and the
repayment of older arrears).
21.
Reporting requirement. Data on repayment of domestic arrears and the remaining
previous-year stock of arrears will be transmitted on a monthly basis within three weeks of
the end of each month.

5

The computerized SIBET expenditure management system tracks priority spending at the program and subprogram levels.

6

A negative target thus represents a floor on net repayment.

62
C. Targets for Monetary Aggregates
Net Foreign Assets of the National Bank of Rwanda (NFA)
22.
A floor applies to the NFA of the NBR for the end-March 2007, end-June 2007, endSeptember 2007, and end-December 2007 targets.
23.
Definition. NFA of the NBR in Rwanda francs are defined, consistent with the
definition of the Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) template, as external assets
readily available to, or controlled by, the NBR net of its external liabilities. Pledged or
otherwise encumbered reserve assets are to be excluded; such assets include, but are not
limited to, reserve assets used as collateral or guarantee for third party external liabilities.
Foreign assets and foreign liabilities in U.S. dollars are converted to Rwanda francs by using
the U.S. dollar/Rwanda franc program exchange rate.7 Foreign assets and liabilities in other
currencies are converted to U.S. dollars by using the actual end-of-period U.S.
dollar/currency exchange rate. Foreign liabilities include, inter alia, use of IMF resources
(CCFF and post-conflict emergency assistance purchases and SAF/ESAF/PRGF
disbursements).
24.
Adjusters (see paragraph 13 for symmetric adjusters to the NCG, including
definitions).
•

The floor on NFA will be adjusted downward by the amount of any negative
difference between actual and “baseline grants” up to a maximum adjustor of
US$30 million, evaluated at the program exchange rate.

•

The floor on NFA will be adjusted downward by the amount of expenditure for food
imports in the case of a food emergency (see also paragraphs 9 and 13).

25.
Reporting requirement. Data on foreign assets and foreign liabilities of the NBR
will be transmitted on a weekly basis within seven days of the end of each week. Data on the
NBR’s foreign exchange liabilities to commercial banks (held as required reserves with the
NBR) and the exchange rate used for their conversion into Rwanda francs will be shown
separately.

7

The program exchange rate for the 2007 program is set at Rf 549.9 = US$1 (actual exchange rate of
September 30, 2006).

63
Reserve Money
26.
A ceiling applies to the stock of reserve money for the end-March 2007, end-June
2007, end-September 2007, and end-December 2007 targets.
27.
Definition. Reserve money for the monetary program is defined as currency in
circulation, reserves of deposit money banks (excluding NBR borrowing from deposit money
banks on the money market8 but including cash in vault held by commercial banks), and
deposits of public enterprises (including Caisse Sociale du Rwanda (CSR) and other
autonomous public agencies (dépôts des établissements publics assimilés à l’état), deposits
of nonbank financial institutions, and deposits of the private sector (autres sommes dues à la
clientèle are included in reserve money). Reserve money excludes the deposits of the Caisse
d’Épargne du Rwanda (C.E.R.) with the NBR up to Rf 1 billion, the dormant accounts up to
Rf 1.4 billion, and import deposits placed at the NBR (cautions à l’importation) up to a
maximum amount of Rf 150 million.
28.

Adjuster.

•

The ceiling on the stock of reserve money will be adjusted symmetrically for a
change in the required reserve ratio of commercial banks by the amount of (new
reserve ratio - program baseline reserve ratio) multiplied by the reservable deposit
liabilities in commercial banks.

29.
Reporting requirement. Data on reserve money will be transmitted on a weekly
basis within seven days of the end of each week. This transmission will include a weekly
balance sheet of the NBR which will show all items listed above in the definitions of reserve
money.
Broad Money
30.
A ceiling applies to the stock of broad money and extended broad money for the endMarch 2007, end-June 2007, end-September 2007, and end-December 2007 targets.
31.
Definition. Broad money is defined as the sum of currency in circulation, deposits in
commercial banks, and nonbank deposits in the NBR. Extended broad money is defined as
broad money plus deposits in credit unions and credit cooperatives (mainly UBPR).

8

Borrowing by the NBR from the commercial banks on the money market is included under the net domestic
assets of the NBR (netted out from commercial bank borrowing from the NBR).

64
32.
Reporting requirement. The balance sheets of the commercial banks and other
banking institutions, both for the individual institutions and for the respective sector in
aggregate, and the monetary survey, will be transmitted monthly within five weeks of the end
of each month. The monthly transmission will also include a monthly balance sheet for the
NBR, showing all items as in NBR’s weekly balance sheet.
D. Limits on External Debt
Limit on short-term external debt of the public sector
33.
A zero ceiling applies to the outstanding stock of external debt with original
maturities of one year or less owned or guaranteed by the public sector or other agencies on
behalf of the central government. The ceiling is measured cumulatively from December 31,
2006 for the end-March 2007, end-June 2007, end-September 2007, and end-December 2007
targets.
34.
Definition. The definition of “debt”, for the purpose of the limit, is set out in point
No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt (Decision No.
12274-(00/85) of August 24, 2000) and also commitments for which value has not been
received. Excluded from this performance criterion are normal import-related credits, defined
as liabilities that arise from the direct extension, during the normal course of trading, of
credit from a supplier to a purchaser—that is, when payment of goods and services is made at
a time that differs from the time when ownership of the underlying goods or services
changes. Normal import credit arrangements covered by this exclusion are self-liquidating;
they contain pre-specified limits on the amounts involved and the times at which payments
must be made; they do not involve the issuance of securities.
35.
Valuation. The amount of debt will be evaluated at the corresponding quarterly
exchange rates published in the IMF’s International Financial Statistics.
36.
Reporting requirement: Data on debt and guarantees will be transmitted, with
detailed explanations, on a monthly basis within five weeks of the end of each month.
Contracting or Guaranteeing of new nonconcessional external debt of the public sector
37.
The public sector or other agencies on behalf of the central government will not
contract or guarantee new nonconcessional external debt1 (as specified in paragraphs 39 and
40) with original maturity of more than one year. This is a continuous performance criterion.
1

As the performance criterion refers to “new” debt, rescheduling or restructuring of existing debt is excluded.

65
38.
Valuation. The amount of debt will be evaluated at the corresponding quarterly
exchange rates published in the IMF’s International Financial Statistics.
39.
Definition. This performance criterion applies to debt as defined in point No. 9 of the
Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt (Decision No. 12274(00/85) of August 24, 2000) and also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which
value has not been received. The use of Fund resources are excluded from the criterion.
Included are leases and other instruments giving rise to external liabilities, contingent or
otherwise.
40.
For program purposes, a debt is concessional if it includes a grant element of at least
50 percent, calculated as follows: the grant element of a debt is the difference between the
net present value (NPV) of debt and its nominal value, expressed as a percentage of the
nominal value of the debt (i.e., the grant element is equal to the nominal value minus NPV
divided by the nominal value). The NPV of debt at the time of its disbursement is calculated
by discounting the future stream of payments of debt service due on this debt. The discount
rates used for this purpose are the currency-specific commercial interest reference rates
(CIRRs), as published by the OECD. For debt with a maturity of at least 15 years, the tenyear average CIRR will be used to calculate the NPV of debt and, hence, its grant element.
For debt with maturity of less than 15 years, the six-month average CIRR will be used. To
both the 10-year and the 6-month averages, the following margins for differing repayment
periods should be added: 0.75 percent for repayment periods of less than 15 years; 1 percent
for 15–19 years; 1.15 percent for 20–29 years; and 1.25 percent for 30 years or more.
41.
Reporting requirement. Data on all new external debt, including government
guarantees, will be provided on a monthly basis within five weeks of the end of each month.
Contracting or guaranteeing of concessional external debt
42.
A ceiling applies to the contracting or guaranteeing of concessional (see paragraph
40) external debt of the public sector or other agencies on behalf of the central government
for the end-June 2007, and end-December 2007 targets. The ceiling on the contracted debt
becomes binding through a disbursement profile over 2007-09.
43.
Definition and valuation. The ceiling on the contracting or guaranteeing of new
concessional external debt will be measured by the U.S. dollar nominal sum of all loan
agreements that have been contracted. Disbursed debt will be converted to U.S dollars, based
on prevailing WEO test date exchange rates; for loans contracted but not yet disbursed, the
profile disbursement will be measured at the actual exchange rate at the test date, based on
the projected drawdown consistent with the medium-term fiscal framework as discussed with
IMF staff. If export growth rates average about 8 percent in the next three years, Rwanda’s
NPV of debt- to-export ratio will be below 125 percent over the medium term and not exceed

66
90 percent in 2009. The Net Present Value of debt is calculated by discounting the future
stream of payments of debt service due, based on a uniform discount rate of 5 percent.
44.
Reporting requirement. Data on the NPV of the stock of outstanding debt will be
provided on a semi-annual basis within five weeks of the end of each month.
Limit on new external payment arrears
45.
A continuous performance criterion applies to the nonaccumulation of new external
payment arrears on external debt contracted or guaranteed by the public sector. External
payment arrears consist of external debt service obligations (principal and interest) that have
not been paid at the time they are due, as specified in the contractual agreements, but shall
exclude arrears on obligations that are subject to rescheduling.
II. STRUCTURAL CONDITIONALITY
46.
The following project accounts will be monitored on a quarterly basis (see
performance criterion on the monitoring of project accounts in paragraph 17 of the
memorandum of economic and financial policies): projet developpement districts et villes;
CDF/programme de decentralisation; Minecofin—CEDP-SME Investment Fund;
PDDC/MINALOC/H094 RW; Minisante Global Alliance for Vaccination; Projet Vct
Integre; Global Fund Controlling Tuberculosis; Global Fund 3 HIV/AIDs; Global Fund 3
Control Malaria; The Nonproject Grant Aid Assistance; MIGEPROFE PRPAF Fonction.
Cellule; RDRP/Multi-Donor Trust Fund; Basket Fund Health Human Resources; Global
Fund 5 Assuring Access; and MINALOC-CDF-Financement Suisse.
III. OTHER DATA REQUIREMENTS FOR PROGRAM MONITORING
47.

Other data will be reported on a regular basis for surveillance purposes (see Table 3).

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the
completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the
decision point. Hence these two amounts can not be added.

31

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed during the interim
period.

32

The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries
that are qualified for the assistance. The debt relief covers the full stock of debt owed to the Fund as of end2004 which remains outstanding at the time the member qualifies for such debt relief. The MDRI is financed by
bilateral contributions and the Fund's own resources, as well as the resources already disbursed to the member
under the HIPC Initiative (see Section VII above).

5
Decision point—point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country
qualifies for assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of assistance to
be committed.
Interim assistance—amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and
completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance
committed at the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional
circumstances).
Completion point—point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its assistance
committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income
as defined in footnote 3 above. The timing of the completion point is linked to the
implementation of pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating completion point).
IX.

Safeguards Assessments:

Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the National Bank of Rwanda is subject to
an update of the 2003 assessment. The previous assessment concluded that substantial risks
existed in the bank’s safeguards framework, and recommendations made to address the main
vulnerabilities have since been implemented.
X.

Exchange System:

The Rwanda franc was pegged to the SDR until March 6, 1995, when Rwanda adopted a
market-determined exchange rate system. The exchange rate has in fact behaved like a
conventional fixed peg for more than a year. On December 1998, Rwanda accepted the
obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the IMF, and maintains a system free of
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. In
2001, a foreign exchange auction system was put in place with technical assistance from
MFD. Since February 7, 2001, auctions have been taking place on a weekly basis. The
exchange rate regime is currently classified as a managed float, and the foreign exchange
auctions impose a limit of +/- RF 5 to the margin by which the exchange rate can vary from
the previous day.
XI.

Article IV Consultation:

Rwanda is on the revised 24-month consultation cycle. The Executive Board discussed the
staff report for the 2004 Article IV consultation (Country Report No. 04/382) on October 6,
2004.

6
XII.

FSAP Participation, ROSCs, and OFC Assessments:

A Report on Observance of Standards and Codes on Fiscal Transparency (ROSC) was issued
in July 2003. A Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) has taken place in February
2005. Rwanda has not had an Offshore Financial Center (OFC) assessment.

II. RWANDA: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of November 2006)
Partnership for Rwanda’s Development Strategy
Donor agencies have been key players in Rwanda since the genocide. With the support from
the international community, Rwanda has made notable progress along an ambitious path of
reconstruction, national reconciliation, and economic reform. In recent years, the
Government has made some ambitious efforts, based on its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP), to reduce poverty and improve living conditions of the poor. The PRSP was
completed in June 2002. This strategy was supported and discussed by the Boards of the IDA
and the IMF on August 12, 2002. The PRSP targeted the halving of poverty by 2015 through
a private sector and rural sector strategy. The strategy mainly focuses on six priority areas:
(1) rural development and agricultural transformation; (2) human development; (3) economic
infrastructure; (4) good governance; (5) private sector development; and (6) institutional
capacity building—as the focus for public actions on poverty reduction. Civil society,
government agencies and ministries, and donors have all been actively involved in the PRSP
process and monitoring. The first PRSP progress report was issued in July 2003 and a BankFund JSA produced in May 2004. The second PRSP progress report was issued in December
2004 and a Bank-Fund JSA was produced in March 2005. The third progress report of the
PRSP was issued in July 2005, and the corresponding Bank-Fund JSAN was produced in
March 2006.
World Bank Group Program and Portfolio
The last Country Assistance Strategy for Rwanda was discussed by the World Bank Board in
December 2002. The current CAS, in support of the first PRSP, will soon come to an end,
and has been extended through the preparation of an Interim Strategy Note (ISN) which was
approved by the Board in September 2007. The ISN ensures that the next CAS, to be
prepared jointly with DFID, is aligned with the second PRSP. Both the CAS and ISN set out
an assistance program consistent with the country’s PRSP and emphasize the need to move
progressively from project-based approaches to budget support. In line with this approach,
a Poverty Reduction Strategy Credit (PRSC) went to the Board in October 2004. This credit
would help strengthen GoR capacity to (i) plan and budget results-oriented public sector
actions supporting the implementation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy; (ii) develop
incentive frameworks through performance-based payments and contracting; (iii) establish
strong accountability mechanisms enhancing the capacity of Rwandan citizens to monitor
and provide feedback to service providers—both public and private; and (iv) implement a
sound fiduciary framework, as well as a monitoring and evaluation system to facilitate
transparency and accountability in service delivery for the sectors of focus (i.e., health,
education, water, energy). A second programmatic operation, Poverty Reduction Support
Grant (PRSG), went to the Board in October 2005 and focused on (i) creating a favorable

9
private sector investment climate that would promote sustained economic growth; (ii)
improving quality, coverage, and equity of basic service delivery; and (iii) improving public
expenditure management and governance. A third PRSG will continue with the same areas of
focus and is expected to go to the Board in December 2006.
International Development Agency (IDA) Program: Since 1970, Rwanda has received
84 IDA credits and grants totaling US$1,458.6 million. As of mid-November 2006, the active
portfolio comprised twelve operations with a total net commitment value of US$300 million,
of which $124 million remains undisbursed.
Overall, IDA has financed projects in (i) infrastructure, particularly road construction and
maintenance, electricity and water supply, and sanitation infrastructure; (ii) agriculture, rural
development, and forestry; (iii) social infrastructure, including health and population, and
education and training; (iv) private sector development, public enterprise reform, financial
development, and technical assistance; and (v) two policy-based quick-disbursing operations
(IRC and PRSC1). During the immediate post-genocide period, IDA financed two
emergency budget support operations and a social fund-type project, and restructured its
prewar portfolio of investment projects to meet the high-priority needs associated with the
emergency and the transition from conflict to development.
International Finance Corporation (IFC) Program: The IFC has made some investments
in Rwanda, in various industries. Investments have been made in the Rwandan match factory
(SORWAL). In FY1998, IFC approved a US$0.53 million investment in Highland Flowers
and in FY2000, a US$6.0 million in RWANDACELL. In December 2000, an investment of
US$0.8 million was approved for an apartment hotel in Kigali. As of today, these
investments with the exception of SORWAL have been cancelled. The IFC has provided
some technical assistance support to Rwanda focusing on privatization, SMEs, the financial
and industrial sectors. Section B below “Statement of IFC Investments in Rwanda” outlines
new investments being considered by IFC.
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) Program: Rwanda signed and
ratified the MIGA Convention on October 27, 1989. On September 27, 2002, it became a full
member of MIGA with the completion of its membership requirements, including payment
of the usable currency and the local currency portions of its initial subscription, and deposit
of the promissory note. The membership was followed by Rwanda’s election to MIGA’s
Board of Directors during the World Bank/IMF annual meetings held in Washington.
Rwanda is one of the 16 post-conflict countries in the region on which MIGA is focusing as
part of its post-conflict strategy. To date, there have been no requests for guarantees coverage
of projects in the country, and thus the Agency’s efforts have focused on complementing the
Bank Group’s strategy of accelerating private sector-led growth in the country.
In consultation with the Bank, MIGA’s technical assistance team undertook an assessment to
assist Rwanda in creating a national investment and trade promotion capability and made

10
recommendations on the proposed Rwanda Investment Authority, as well as on the medium
to long-term prospects for the country to attract foreign investment. Previously, MIGA
collaborated with the World Bank to advise on the establishment of the Rwanda Investment
and Export Promotion Agency (RIEPA) and provided considerable information on

III. Statement of IFC Investments in Rwanda
With the aim of creating further investment opportunities in the Great Lakes Region and to
allow the countries to benefit from economies of scale, the IFC is taking a regional approach
while at the same time exploring investment opportunities. Operations under consideration
are the following:
Infrastructure-Energy: IFC is exploring the possibility of participating in the financing of Kibuye
Power Ltd (a Lake Kivu Methane Gas Project) under concession to Dane Associates with Wartsila
as a technical partner. Project cost is estimated at US$72 million and IFC may invest up toUS$18
million in the project.
Infrastructure-Logistics: M/s Intraspeed SA Rwanda Ltd (ISARL) is a major freight and forwarding
company operating in the Great Lakes Region of Eastern Africa. The company is involved in bulk
haulage of containerized general cargo and liquid cargo from the major ports of Mombasa, Darsalaam, Tanga, and Mtwara to Kenya, Mozambique and the land locked destination countries of
Uganda, Rwanda, DR Congo, Tanzania, Burundi, Zambia and Malawi. IFC approved an investment
of up to US$7.5 million on November 10, 2006 to assist the upgrade and expansion of ISARL’s
freight hauling capabilities.
Financial Sector: Rwanda completed the privatization of its financial sector, with the sale of the
controlling shares in the Banque Commerciale du Rwanda (BCR) to the UK-based Actis Group and
the Banque Continental African (BACAR) to Kenya-based FINA Bank. IFC is exploring
opportunities for long term credit lines and trade finance facilities to these banks to improve access
to MSME finance. IFC approved a trade finance line of up to US$2 million for BCR. In the near
term, there will be a strong role for IFC in the financial sector, in helping the development of the
sector.
Tourism sector: Rwanda is developing a cluster of good quality hotels and may require IFC
assistance for long term financing. IFC will consider post privatization financing of the new
investors buying Hotel Intercontinental in Kigali and the Kivu Sun in Kibuye. IFC will also
consider financing the rehabilitation and refurbishment of Hotel Milles de Collines.
In addition, IFC advisory and technical assistance role is expected to continue to center on the
promotion of the private sector, including, the establishment of a sound enabling environment
and the development of the financial sector. In this respect, IFC is implementing a leasing
development program in Rwanda. Initial support consists of: (i) assisting with the review of the
leasing code completed in October 2005; and (ii) contributing to a leasing financing feasibility
study. Based on the outcome of the feasibility study, IFC PEP Africa has started a longer-term
leasing development program with an office in Rwanda, comparable to the one currently underway
in Tanzania. Also, the IFC has obtained a mandate to provide advisory services to the Government
of Rwanda on the privatization of Rwanda Air.

14
The IFC proposes to develop entrepreneurship in Rwanda. The program would address the
needs of existing SMEs to expand their businesses, but also the needs of potential entrepreneurs.
Working with institutions such as the private sector federation and business schools, the program
proposes to: build capacity for business service providers; support vocational business skills
development; and build capacity for entrepreneurship development and training in business schools
and private sector institutions. The IFC would approach interested donors for joint support of these
activities, and it is expected that the program would be in place during the first semester of calendar
year 2007.

15
III. RWANDA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Although economic data are generally adequate for surveillance, weaknesses hamper economic
analysis. National accounts and price statistics, government finance, and balance of payments
statistics continue to suffer from significant weaknesses. Monetary statistics and data relevant for
banking supervision are adequate for surveillance and program monitoring, but scope for
improvements in quality and timeliness remains. Rwanda has participated in the General Data
Dissemination System since October 2003.
Since the end of the civil war of 1994, Rwanda has received considerable technical assistance (TA)
in rebuilding its statistical database, and there has been some progress in the compilation and
dissemination of economic and financial statistics. In August 2005, the National Institute of
Statistics (NIS) was established following the passage of the new Statistics Law.
National Accounts and Price Statistics
The national accounts are compiled and disseminated by NIS, based on 1968 System of National
Accounts methodology. Quality is weak, reflecting inadequate human and material resources. While
considerable effort was made to improve the reliability of GDP estimates using the production
approach, significant weaknesses in data collection on expenditures, and income remain.,
complicating an adequate assessment of developments in savings and investment. The reliability of
national accounts estimates is further hampered by weak external sector statistics.
Since 2003, the East AFRITAC has advised the authorities on real sector statistics issues, especially
in secondary sector statistics. This assistance is focused on capacity building to enable the
construction of short-term indicators such as a monthly PPI for the manufacturing sector. This is a
joint project with the central bank (NBR). The results have not yet been integrated in the national
accounts. A DFID project is also supporting the NIS with a component on national accounts, aiming
to establish a program of economic surveys and the development of leading indicators that can
serve as source data for national accounts estimates In February 2004 the EREBS group (Equilibre
resources-emploi des biens et services) assisted the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning
(MINECOFIN) in developing new benchmarking GDP estimates (2001). Work has also advanced
in the implementation of the 1993 SNA.
The consumer price index (CPI, 2003=100) utilizes expenditure weights derived from a 2000-1
survey of 6,450 households (local goods account for about 70 percent of expenditure and imported
goods about30 percent; food and drink accounts for 37 percent of expenditures and housing and
energy amount to 16 percent). Certain shortcomings remain, as the CPI aggregates infrequently
purchased products in groups with all products in the respective group assigned the same weight.
Real sector data are reported regularly for publication in International Finance Statistics (IFS),
although with some lags, particularly for GDP estimates. Data on employment and wages are not
collected, except for the central government and for daily informal work.

16
Government Finance Statistics
Detailed monthly revenues and expenditures are reported to AFR with a lag of three to four weeks.
These data are compiled by the flash-reporting unit of MINECOFIN. A functional classification of
government expenditure has been designed and presented since the 2003 budget. Within the
economic classification, expenditures on PRSP designated as “priority areas” are clearly
identifiable. The fiscal data do not consistently capture capital expenditure because capital projects
(almost entirely externally financed) are mainly carried out by line ministries outside the regular
budget process. Compilation of data on external budgetary assistance as well as on external debt
would benefit from strengthened coordination between the finance ministry and the central bank.
Efforts are underway to integrate the development budget into the normal budgetary procedures.
Fiscal data often showed a discrepancy between above-the-line deficits and financing estimates. To
address these issues with the Fund staff, the authorities have made adjustments for changes in the
balance of non-core government accounts, for changes in cash in vault at the revenue authority, for
accounting errors, and for other factors.
Selected aggregates on annual central government operations through 2004 have been reported to
STA for publication in the IFS, But are subject to large discrepancies, largely due to the timing of
recording of expenditures. No sub-annual data are reported to STA, and government finance
statistics (GFS) have not been reported for publication in the GFS Yearbook since 1993.
Monetary Statistics
The balance sheet of the NBR and detailed data on money market transactions are transmitted to the
AFR on a weekly basis with a lag of one week, while the monetary survey and the consolidated
balance sheet of the country’s commercial banks are transmitted on a monthly basis with a lag of
about five weeks. Detailed data on interbank money market transactions are also provided upon
request to mission staff. Monetary data are reported separately to STA and published in IFS. The
data relating to the central bank are provided with a five-week lag while the data on commercial
banks are reported with a delay of about three months. As a result of implementing TA
recommendations, the NBR (1) adapted in early 2004 the reporting format for the banking sector
closer to the methodology proposed in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual; and (2) is
expanding the institutional coverage of the monetary survey to include credit and savings unions
and microfinance institutions. Despite these efforts, inconsistencies remain in the banking sector
data and a STA monetary and financial statistics mission is planned for 2007 to address outstanding
issues.
The NBR is in the process of submitting monetary statistics through the Standardized Report Forms
(SRFs). Following the provisional submissions by the NBR of SRFs covering January through
December 2004, the NBR has completed the transition to report the 1SR for central bank data. It
has not yet completed the process for the 2SR for the commercial banks and reporting under the
existing framework has continued.

17
External Sector Statistics
The quality of balance of payments is affected by weaknesses in the collection of source data
(treatment of customs data and bank settlement reports, questionnaires) and insufficient staffing.
A June 2003 multisector statistics mission identified the following areas for improvement in the
short run: (1) reorganizing data entry and production of external trade statistics, using ASYCUDA
and Eurotrace software; (2) adapting survey forms sent to companies to the BPM5 methodology;
and (3) collaborating with Central Public Investments and External Finance Bureau (CEPEX) to
obtain data on international and bilateral aid. Subsequently, STA balance of payments statistics
missions visited Kigali in January 2004 and June 2005.
Some improvements have been noted. In particular, the collection of data through direct surveys
seems to be well in place, with a satisfactory rate of response, except for embassies. Also, with the
assistance of these missions, the NBR has started compiling BOP/IIP statistics in conformity with
international standards.
Nevertheless some weaknesses remain, in particular, the compilation of trade data relies extensively
on estimates because of delays in the processing of customs declarations. The treatment of bank
settlement reports is not effective, because the complete automation of the collection of declarations
has not been achieved. And, finally, there is still no appropriate treatment of data on foreign official
aid, for which no distinction is made between grants and loans.
Annual balance of payments and IIP data through 2005 have been reported to STA for publication
in the IFS.
Databases on external public debt are maintained by both MINECOFIN and the NBR. A committee,
composed of staffs from the Ministries of Finance and Economic Planning and Foreign Affairs and
the NBR, is responsible for collecting, harmonizing, and monitoring information on external public
debt.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
January 29, 2007
1.
The following information has become available since the issuance of the staff report.
The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged.
2.
The prior action on issuing the first report of a monitoring system of project
accounts was implemented on January 9, 2007.
3.
Policy implementation appears to have remained broadly on track in the last
quarter of 2006. Both the end-2006 targets on reserve money and net foreign assets were
met. International reserves were higher than programmed, mostly on account of higher-thanprogrammed project disbursements. The authorities have indicated that draft accounting
instructions, forms, and procedures for budget users will be issued within the next month, but
the related end-December 2006 benchmark was not met. As foreshadowed in the staff report,
the end-December 2006 benchmark for undertaking a comprehensive review of the wage
structure of the public sector has not been met and is expected to be implemented by March
2007.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 9, 2007

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with
Rwanda
On January 29, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Rwanda.1
Background
Rwanda has made great strides since the 1994 genocide. National rehabilitation has moved
forward, including through presidential and legislative polls in 2003, and community-based
hearings of those accused of genocide. Output has rebounded driven mostly by a recovery in
the agriculture sector. With the help of debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) Initiative and Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), the external position has
strengthened and macroeconomic stability has been largely achieved. Progress has also been
made in structural reforms and Rwanda is advancing toward the Millennium Development
Goals, with good results noticeable in education and gender issues. Nonetheless, poverty
remains widespread and the economy remains vulnerable to climatic and terms of trade shocks.
The government of Rwanda’s medium-term policies address the country’s challenges to
increase growth and make headway toward the Millennium Development Goals.
Macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability are considered prerequisites for strong growth.
Policies will also focus on further fostering private sector development, making the country more
competitive, and removing obstacles to growth, which include low agricultural yields, limited and
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
expensive electricity supply, a poor transportation network, a shallow financing system, and
high cost of doing business.
To support their policies, the authorities requested a three year Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF) arrangement, which was approved on June 5, 2006. The program is designed
to maintain macroeconomic stability while setting the stage for stronger growth and poverty
reduction.
The PRGF-supported program remained broadly on track in 2006. Growth is expected to
exceed 4 percent, reflecting buoyant activity in the manufacturing, services, and financial
sectors. However, mostly owing to rising prices for food and energy products, 12-month inflation
increased to 11 percent in November. Macroeconomic policies remain in line with the program,
but short-term risks have evolved on the monetary side from a large increase in private sector
credit. On the structural front, banking supervision is being strengthened, including through
amendments in the banking law currently at parliament. With the passage of the Organic
Budget Law in August 2006, expenditure management reforms also have picked up momentum.
In addition, the authorities have been focusing on reforms to improve the business climate for
the private sector and enhance productivity in the agricultural sector.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended Rwanda’s sound macroeconomic management and progress on
structural reforms and social reconstruction. Together with debt relief, this has led to
macroeconomic stability, strong economic growth, and progress in advancing toward the
Millennium Development Goals.
Nevertheless, Directors stressed that Rwanda continues to face major challenges in the period
ahead. Poverty remains pervasive, per capita income growth has slowed in recent years,
inflation pressures have resurfaced, and debt sustainability remains a concern despite HIPC
and MDRI debt relief. Directors noted the limited impact of past growth on poverty reduction,
and recommended that the reasons for this be explored in order to help prioritize and sequence
future reforms.
Directors observed that, to boost growth and reduce poverty, the authorities will need to
address Rwanda’s severe infrastructure gap and low agricultural yields, enhance export
competitiveness, improve the business climate, strengthen and deepen the financial sector, and
tackle the skilled labour shortages. These measures will need to be backed by a prudent
borrowing policy and continued reliance on concessional and grant financing, to ensure that
fiscal and debt sustainability is maintained. In this context, Directors supported the authorities’
strategy to keep the net present value of the public debt below 125 percent of exports over the
long run.
While Directors welcomed scaled-up aid for Rwanda given the country’s urgent spending
needs, they underscored the importance of ensuring that macroeconomic stability is maintained.
Close coordination of fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies will be crucial. In particular,
Directors noted that increased aid is likely to intensify pressures for real exchange rate

3
appreciation. They urged the central bank to follow through on its commitment to more nominal
exchange rate flexibility by allowing a gradual appreciation through increased sales of foreign
exchange. This would reduce the need for costly domestic sterilization to keep inflation down.
Directors also stressed that the growth of private sector credit and inflationary developments
need to be closely monitored, and the monetary stance kept tight until inflation is firmly on a
downward path.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ plans to broaden the tax base and increase priority
spending in 2007. Going forward, efforts to mobilize revenue and control nonpriority spending
should be further strengthened. In this context, Directors stressed that expenditure prioritization
and control would be facilitated if future budgets are embedded in a medium-term expenditure
framework.
Directors supported the structural reforms being implemented to improve public service delivery.
The public expenditure management action plan is encouraging, but efforts should be stepped
up to tackle weaknesses in expenditure management more systematically. Directors called on
the authorities to move forward on civil service reform and urged prompt action to complete the
review of the civil service wage structure. They also emphasized the need for increased training
to build expertise and overcome capacity constraints in the public sector.
Directors welcomed the efforts to strengthen bank supervision and regulation, particularly in the
microfinance sector, and looked forward to early progress in developing the medium-term
financial sector reform agenda. Directors also supported the authorities’ moves to improve the
business environment and increase the openness of the economy, including through
membership in the East African Community and other trade arrangements. In this regard,
issues related to energy, transport and communications, and the cost of doing business in
Rwanda would need to be vigorously addressed.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

IMF Executive Board Completes First Review of Rwanda’s Three-Year Arrangement
Under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the first review of
Rwanda’s performance under an SDR 8.01 million (about US$12 million) Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility (PRGF)1 arrangement (see Press Release No. 06/121). Completion of the
review enables a further release of SDR 1.1 million (about US$1.7) which will bring total
amount drawn under the arrangement to SDR 2.3 million (about US$3.4 million).
In completing the review, the Board granted waivers for the non-observance of a quantitative
performance criterion concerning total priority spending and a structural performance criterion
concerning issuing a first report on a monitoring system of project accounts.
Following conclusion of the Executive Board’s discussion of Rwanda’s economic program,
Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, said:
“The Rwandan Authorities are to be commended for continuing to make good progress under
their program supported by the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility. Macroeconomic
performance has continued to be satisfactory and structural reforms are broadly on track.
“Nevertheless, to reduce widespread poverty and make headway toward the Millennium
Development Goals, decisive action is needed to remove obstacles to higher growth, which
include low agricultural yields, a severe infrastructure gap, and an underdeveloped financial
system. This will also involve making the most effective use of aid, addressing the risk of a
resurgence of inflationary pressures, and prudently managing debt to maintain debt
sustainability.
“Against this background, the authorities are appropriately focusing on addressing the
macroeconomic policy challenges arising from scaled-up aid, while increasing spending for

The PRGF is the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. PRGF-supported programs are based on
country-owned poverty reduction strategies that are adopted in a participatory process involving civil society and
development partners and articulated in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). This is intended to ensure
that PRGF-supported programs are consistent with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural, and
social policies to foster growth and reduce poverty. PRGF loans carry an annual interest rate of 0.5 percent and are
repayable over 10 years with a 5½-year grace period on principal payments.

social and infrastructure priorities. In this regard, the 2007 budget is an important milestone in
Rwanda’s development because it judiciously increases allocations for priority areas, particularly
investments in the water and energy sectors. To address the inflationary pressures stemming
from increased spending and prevent costly sterilization through a build-up of domestic debt, the
central bank is committed to allowing greater flexibility of the exchange rate by stepping up
sales of foreign exchange. The central bank also plans to keep a tight monetary stance until
inflation is firmly on a downward trend.
“The authorities’ structural reform agenda is geared toward improving public service delivery
and removing obstacles to growth, including by according priority to building capacity in both
the civil service and the private sector. The public expenditure management plan is an
encouraging step, but further progress will be needed in addressing weaknesses in expenditure
management more systematically. Rwanda’s infrastructure investments, reform of the banking
system and overhaul of business-related laws are expected to stimulate private sector
development. Going forward, it will also be important to advance trade integration and follow
through on the design of medium-term financial sector reforms,” Mr. Portugal said.

Statement by Laurean W. Rutayisire
Executive Director for Rwanda
January 29, 2007

I – Introduction
At the outset, my Rwandese authorities would like to express their sincere appreciation to
staff for the well-written set of papers and the candid exchange of views and constructive
policy dialogue held during the discussion on the 2007 Article IV consultation and the first
review under the three-year PRGF-supported program. My Rwandese authorities would also
like to thank Executive Directors and Management for their continued support and advice
received over the past years.
With my authorities’ strong commitment to reforms and adequate Fund-supported programs,
Rwanda has since the 1994 genocide made commendable progress in macroeconomic
stability and implementing structural reforms, in addition to social rehabilitation. Based on
these achievements my authorities reached the completion point under the enhanced HIPC in
April 2005 and benefited from the MDRI debt cancellation in January 2006. In order to
continue addressing challenges ahead in sustaining economic growth and reduce poverty,
Rwanda embarked in June 2006 on a three-year arrangement under the PRGF with low
access. As a result, macroeconomic performance is in line with the program and structural
reforms are broadly on track. Indeed, all but two performance criteria for the first review
were met. The quantitative end-June performance criteria on priority spending and the
structural end-August performance criteria on improving the monitoring of projects accounts
were missed due to technical difficulties beyond the authorities’ control. As these difficulties
have been resolved, the end-September target on priority spending was met and they also
expect to meet the end-December target. Regarding the report of a monitoring system of
project accounts, the end-August performance criterion was implemented in January 9, 2007
as a prior action.
In view of overall satisfactory program performance, my authorities request the Board’s
support for the completion of the first PRGF arrangement review and the waivers of
nonobservance of two performance criteria. My Rwandese authorities are cognizant of the
daunting challenges ahead and the need to preserve macroeconomic stability, accelerate
structural reforms designed to boost growth and enhance competitiveness. The authorities are
committed to maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and advancing on structural
reforms. To this end they continue to count on the strong support of the international
community in their efforts going forward. They are also appreciative of assistance received
from their development partners, in order to help meet the challenges ahead.

II - Recent Economic Developments and PRGF Implementation
Growth performance in Rwanda is beginning to assume a broader front in addition to the
construction sector which has been the dominant force behind the economic growth
experienced in recent years. Now buoyant activity is picking up in manufacturing, services
and financial sectors. Economic growth is expected to reach 4 percent in 2006, despite the
poor harvest in the agricultural sector due to bad rainfalls and the energy oil price shock.
In the fiscal area good performance has also been recorded. In particular revenue
enhancement measures which included a widening of the tax net and a broadening of the tax
base to fringe benefits resulted in revenue collection overperforming program targets and
overall expenditure remained on track. As a result the end-June target on the domestic deficit
was met by a wide margin. Moreover, the authorities further strengthened economic
legislation, with a view to improve tax efficiency and are continuing to address weaknesses
identified in implementing the Organic Budget Law. The authorities have indicated that draft
accounting instructions, forms and procedures for budget users will be issued within next
month while the review of the wage structure of the public sector is expected to be
implemented by March 2007.
In the monetary area, targets on reserve money and net foreign assets set for end-2006 were
met although inflation increased to 11 percent mainly due to the rise in food and energy
prices.
The external current account for 2006 is expected to be better than programmed. On one
hand, imports were lower than envisaged. On the other hand, the Banque Nationale du
Rwanda (BNR) increased sterilization of government spending through domestic
instruments. Exports receipts also increased, due to high volumes of coffee and tea exports.
On the exchange rate front, the nominal exchange rate depreciated, although there was an
appreciation in the real effective exchange rate terms.
With regard to structural reforms, implementation was broadly conducted as planned. In their
efforts to bring the banking supervision in line with international best practices, the
authorities submitted in September to Parliament, necessary amendments to the banking law.
In addition, they closed 9 mismanaged Microfinance Institutions. To stabilize the situation
and avoid adverse contagion, half of net deposits were reimbursed to depositors and
measures were also put in place to administer the recovery of outstanding loans. To enhance
public financial management, the authorities issued guidelines for undertaking bank
reconciliation and accounting for government agencies. They also approved the publication
of the Organic Budget Law and its supporting financial regulations as well as the creation of
a Decentralization Unit in the Ministry of Finance. To strengthen debt management, the
reconciliation of the debt databases maintained by the Ministry of Finance and the NBR was
implemented. To improve the investment climate, the authorities approved the draft laws on

3
establishing registration agency and on intellectual property and submitted the laws to
Parliament.
III - Economic Policies and Structural Reforms Going Forward
My Rwandese authorities are fully aware of the need to pursue the implementation of prudent
policies and accelerate structural reforms, geared to sustain growth, reduce poverty and
achieve the remaining MDGs. Accordingly in 2007, macroeconomic policies will focus on
improving the well-being of the population and growth-enhancing investments and reforms.
My authorities expect growth to reach 6.5 percent, inflation brought down to 5 percent and
international reserves maintained at least 4.3 months of imports. To this end they are
determined to step up their efforts to remove obstacles to private sector and assign high
priority to the new identified sources of growth including development of agricultural and
tourism sectors as well as improvement in infrastructure and energy supply.
Fiscal policy
My authorities remain committed to prudent fiscal policy, with a view to well manage the
domestic demand impact of fiscal policies. On the revenue front, the objective is to maintain
the ratio of revenue-to-GDP at the level of 15 percent of GDP. Measures identified to further
increase fiscal revenue include, among others, implementing tax on mobile and fixed
telephone, raising the excise tax on cigarettes and as well as increasing the reference price for
petroleum products. Moreover, on the basis of a survey on the informal sector, ways and
means will be devised to widen the tax base over the medium-term. With regard to public
expenditure, my authorities intend to increase the share of priority spending in the budget,
while improving the quality of public services. Priority spending will increase for social
sector and enhancing the productivity of the economy. Part of the increase in this priority
spending will be financed through the MDRI debt relief. The authorities also intend to
undertake an audit of the 2006 peace keeping expenditures and publish the audits results by
end-March 2007, reduce to 2.37 percent of GDP the military spending, reallocate funds from
tertiary to lower education and, improve the quality of education by hiring more teachers and
providing districts and schools with more control of incentive schemes. A new structured
electricity tariffs adopted earlier on is scheduled to be implemented early 2007 and the
authorities stand ready to raise electricity tariffs if the need arises. Regarding the domestic
deficit in 2007, it is projected to increase by about 1 percent of GDP, excluding spending on
demobilization and peace keeping.
Capacity constraints explain the difficulties facing the authorities in the management of the
fiscal area notably in the execution of the budget. To alleviate these constraints, there is a
need for the Fund to play a crucial role by providing a well targeted technical assistance in
collaboration with Rwanda’s development partners.

4
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
Monetary policy’s objective pursued by my Rwandese authorities is to keep inflation under
control. To this end, they will continue to use reserve money as the operational target.
Monetary developments will be closely monitored and excess of liquidity will be sterilized
through the sales of foreign exchange. For 2007, Rwandese authorities aim at reducing the
inflation level to 5 percent, which will limit year-end reserve money growth to 13 percent
and enable more room for credit to the private sector.
The exchange rate system adopted in 1995 has served the economy well. Rwanda accepted in
1998 the obligations under Article VIII, Sections2, 3, and 4 and maintains a system free of
restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. My authorities
acknowledge that an increase in spending from higher aid flows is likely to result in further
pressures for a real exchange rate appreciation. To address the issue, they will forcefully
implement the NBR’s intervention strategy with a view not to rekindle inflation or crowd out
private investment. In their efforts to further promote the market-oriented system, my
authorities have started to pave the way for an interbank-based market. In this respect, an
instruction was issued last June to improve auction procedures and abolish the provision
allowing the NBR to check whether the foreign exchange purchased at auction was used in
accordance with regulations. Amendments to the foreign exchange regulations were also
issued in order to address regulatory constraints and reduce reporting requirements.
Moreover, on the issue of further selling foreign exchange in order to mop up excess of
liquidity and preserve Rwanda’s competitiveness, my authorities are of the view that this
approach should be gradual and close coordination of fiscal, monetary and exchange rate
policies should be made with a view to help address the volatility of external aid which
continues to be crucial. My authorities cognizant of the need to further deepen the foreign
exchange market and to this end call on the Fund to provide technical assistance designed to
help assess the framework and operational guidelines of the existing market. This assessment
will enable my authorities to enhance the dialogue with staff on the issue regarding the
flexibility of the exchange rate.
Financial sector issues
The financial sector has improved over the recent years and authorities are determined to
enhance banking supervision, including supervision of microfinance institutions through the
implementation of recommendations made by the 2005 FSAP. In addition to further
strengthening financial institutions, the authorities aim at increasing the savings rate and
open up access to credit. In order to prevent the recurrence of crisis in the microfinance
sector, a law on microfinance institutions will be submitted to Parliament by June 2007. The
minimum capital requirements for these institutions will be increased, as well as exposure
limits for group loans and adequate management will be required in granting licenses.
Regarding the modernization of the payment system, a unit was created in March 2006 to

5
coordinate the various components of the process. My authorities also intend to reorganize
and financially restructure SYMTEL with the World Bank’s technical assistance. As for the
promotion of the insurances’ industry, an action plan designing the framework for the
regulation and supervision has been launched. Furthermore and in order to adopt the
international financial reporting standard (IFRS), the authorities have initiated a training
program for accountants and intend to amend relevant tax laws, with a view to allow
companies to base tax returns on IFRS standards.
External sector and debt issues
The authorities through their export promotion strategy will continue to focus on enhancing
the productivity in the traditional sectors and diversify the country’s export base. On the
external debt front, it is worth noting that the implementation of debt relief under the
enhanced HIPC and MDRI is at an advanced stage. The indicators of Rwanda’s debt
sustainability are more favorable than at the last program review. Most of the creditors have
provided debt relief to Rwanda or are willing to cancel outstanding loans. Taking fully into
account these achievements, my Rwandese authorities remain committed to pursuing a
prudent debt management policy. In this regard, a new debt recording system linking the
Treasury and the NBR will be in place early 2007. An indicative target on the Net Present
Value of external debt for 2007 will be introduced, in order to ensure the debt sustainability
and allow a review of the medium-term indebtedness profile.
Regional trade and integration
My Rwandese authorities are cognizant of the importance of regional trade and integration in
the country’s development strategy. Benefits expected from the country’ participation in the
promotion of regional trade and economic integration include diversification of the economy
through broadening export base and enhancing capacity to finance the development efforts.
In this context and since November 2006 Rwanda became a member of the East African
Community. The terms of the treaty and customs union will be negotiated in 2007 and
implemented by end-2008. Moreover, negotiations are also ongoing on a customs union in
the Common Market for Easter and Southern Africa in addition to discussions on an
Economic Partnership Agreement with the European Union. It is worth noting that Rwanda’s
participation in all these arrangements will enable the country to promote its external trade,
address common issues including infrastructure needs and free movement of goods, people
and services.
Structural reforms and competitiveness
My authorities are determined to pursue their structural reform agenda, with a view to tackle
obstacles identified on the path towards a strong and sustainable economic growth. Among
these obstacles, they note low agricultural yields, severe infrastructure gap, a shallow
financial system and high cost of doing business. Therefore, improvements in the country’s

6
competitiveness will hinge on pursuing structural reforms geared to boost the productivity of
agricultural and export sectors as well as improving the conditions of the private sector
promotion. In this respect the authorities will enhance the dialogue with all stakeholders and
further strengthen the link between policies and growth and poverty alleviation. In their
efforts to create conducive environment for investment and private sector promotion, my
Rwandese authorities have submitted to Parliament five out of 14 business laws including a
bankruptcy law. They plan to introduce in the course of the years to come laws pertained to
contract enforcement, e-commerce and labor. They also plan to establish by March 2007 a
program on “Commercial Justice, Business and Land Registration ” in partnership with the
private sector, make operational by October 2007 the Office of the Register and Land Titles
and reduce by August 2007 the number of documents required for exports and imports.
In addition my authorities are mindful that factors other than exchange rate policy are
important in determining the level of competitiveness of the economy. In particular my
authorities are committed to improving the business environment, implementing civil service
reforms, investing in infrastructure, enhancing agricultural productivity, promoting new
information technologies and communication networks in order to increase the supply
responsiveness of the economy.
IV - Conclusion
In order to continue making significant progress in reducing poverty and reaching the MDGs,
my Rwandese authorities are fully committed to policies and reforms set out in the current
PRGF-supported program. With the continued support of the Fund and the international
community, commendable achievements have been made in addressing the country’s
difficult challenges. Nevertheless, a lot remains to be done in order to sustain growth,
improve competitiveness and alleviate poverty in a context of limited resources. My
authorities are hopeful that strong and continued technical and financial assistance from the
international community will be forthcoming. On their behalf, I will appreciate the Board’s
support for the completion of the first review under the PRGF for Rwanda and waivers for
nonobservance of two performance criteria.
