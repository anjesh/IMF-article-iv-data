SLOVAK REPUBLIC
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the
2007 Consultation with the Slovak Republic
Approved by Susan Schadler and Anthony R. Boote

Executive Summary
Background: Slovakia has become one of Central Europe’s strongest economic performers over the past
few years. Growth prospects have shifted to a higher level, driven by productivity gains and buoyant
exports. Slovakia is well poised to adopt the euro in 2009. The Maastricht inflation criterion seems within
reach, and the 2007–09 budget framework is aimed at meeting the euro zone entry objective. The improved
economic outlook has led to persistent appreciation pressures prompting the authorities to revalue the central
parity under ERM2 in mid-March.
Challenges: Key challenges are to satisfy the test of exchange rate stability under ERM2; to ensure greater
fiscal and labor market flexibility for absorbing asymmetric shocks in the monetary union; and to continue
with structural reforms to sustain growth and to address the high unemployment problem.
Authorities’ views: The authorities are giving priority to euro adoption but are also committed to socially
inclusive growth. While recognizing the merits of a stronger counter-cyclical fiscal policy, they drew
attention to the political commitments to devote additional resources to meeting social welfare goals. Labor
market policies were aimed at spreading the gains from growth to low-income workers. They were
concerned about the rapid pace of exchange rate appreciation and the risk of an overly strong conversion
rate when the euro is adopted.
Staff views: Implementation of prudent policies have contributed to the impressive economic performance.
Staff recommended a more ambitious fiscal consolidation given the strong growth outlook and challenges in
fending off appreciation pressures. The rising share of non-discretionary expenditure would reduce
budgetary flexibility. Recent labor market policy initiatives could increase wage drift and undermine wage
flexibility. Competitiveness remains satisfactory thus far. However, further rapid appreciation of the koruna
could be disruptive for small and medium-sized exporters. The NBS should use its policy instruments in a
manner that will limit opportunities for one-way bets in the foreign exchange market, and lower policy
interest rates.
Slovakia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII and maintains an exchange system that is free of
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. Slovakia
maintains exchange restrictions for security reasons that have been notified to the Fund.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Slovakia has become one of Central Europe’s strongest economic performers
over the past few years. Sound macroeconomic management, a wide range of structural
reforms, and increasing integration with the European Union (EU) have led to progressive
strengthening of economic growth. However, regional inequalities have not diminished, and
long-term unemployment remains high among the low-skilled and in the less-advanced
regions.
2.
Slovakia entered ERM2 in November 2005, and the new coalition government
formed following the June 2006 elections is committed to adopting the euro in January
2009. The prospect appears feasible. Notwithstanding the government’s emphasis on higher
social spending, the 2007–09 budget framework aims at meeting the Maastricht fiscal deficit
criterion in 2007 and achieving further fiscal consolidation thereafter. The near-term inflation
outlook has improved, and the Maastricht reference rate seems within reach. Slovakia already
meets the Maastricht criteria for long-term interest rates and the public debt ratio.

One concern, however, is the considerable strengthening of the koruna since October 2006
and the persistence of appreciation pressure, prompted by a favorable economic outlook and
positive investor sentiment toward the region. This could potentially pose a threat to
competitiveness as well as, in the event of a sudden change in investor sentiment, complicate
meeting the test of exchange rate stability under ERM2.
3.
The main challenges ahead are to manage the potential vulnerabilities in the
process of euro adoption and to implement policies that will sustain strong performance
in the monetary union. Accordingly, the consultation discussions concentrated on: coping
with the appreciation pressures in the foreign exchange market; ensuring greater fiscal and
labor market flexibility for absorbing asymmetric shocks in the absence of a national

4
monetary policy; and continuing with structural reforms to sustain growth and to address the
high unemployment problem and regional inequalities.
II. BACKGROUND

Economic growth picked up further in 2006, bringing output close to its
estimated potential. Real GDP growth accelerated to 8¼ percent, supported by strong
productivity gains. Domestic demand growth remained robust, albeit slowing in momentum,

The strength of the economy boosted employment, but wage pressure was
subdued and profitability continued to rise. Employment gains were concentrated in
construction and market services. The unemployment rate fell sharply to 13 percent, though
long-term unemployment remained stuck at

Inflation was on an upward path for much of 2006, but this trend reversed in the
fourth quarter. Harmonized consumer price (HICP) inflation reached 5 percent (year-onyear) in July-August 2006 but declined thereafter to 2 percent in February-March 2007.
Inflation developments were heavily influenced by trends in world energy prices, the
unwinding of the base effects of the large increases in several regulated utility prices in
October 2005, and decreases in regulated prices in January 2007 that were in part attributable
to margin compression by distributors under pressure from the government.

Financial market trends were influenced by mutually reinforcing domestic and
global developments. During May-July 2006, negative investor sentiment on emerging
markets as well as concerns about the election outcome and course of policies led to
depreciation pressures on the koruna and increases in long-term koruna rates and default risk
premium on government bonds. In subsequent months, global risk aversion toward emerging
markets decreased and Slovak financial assets received an extra boost as the new government
affirmed its commitment to euro adoption and a flow of new information pointed to strongerthan-expected economic fundamentals. Thus, financial derivatives reverted to pricing in
interest rate convergence with the euro area, and the koruna resumed an appreciation trend at
a faster pace than other regional currencies (Figure 2).
8.
The National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) has been following a hybrid monetary
framework focused on restraining inflation and on maintaining the exchange rate
within ERM2 requirements. Concerns about a negative inflation outlook prompted the
NBS to increase its key policy interest rate in four steps in the first three quarters of 2006 by
a total of 175 basis points to 4.75 percent. In July 2006, the NBS intervened heavily in the
foreign exchange market to stem depreciation pressures when the koruna dropped below the
central parity under ERM2. In end-December, as the koruna approached the upper edge of
the ERM2 ±15 percent band, the NBS began countering appreciation pressures through
verbal and direct interventions and prolonged rejection of bids during regular repo auctions,
driving down interbank interest rates below policy rates. Eventually in mid-March 2007, with
appreciation pressures persisting, the central parity was revalued with the approval of the EU
member states by 8.5 percent to Sk35.44—below the prevailing market rate. The NBS has

6
continued to counter appreciation pressures since the parity revaluation and has held the
koruna at around 6 percent above the new central parity. With inflation coming down
markedly in the first quarter of 2007 and judging upside risks to be low, the NBS lowered its
policy rate by 50 basis points in two steps since end-March (Figure 3). Because of the large
capital outflows and NBS interventions to stem depreciation pressures in mid-year, gross
official reserves declined in 2006 and fell further below the stock of short-term debt
(Table 4). However, the reserve position has improved in 2007 owing to interventions aimed
at countering appreciation pressures.
9.
With rising interest rates, credit growth eased slightly in 2006. Credit growth in
Slovakia was broadly similar to that in the slower growing neighboring countries but well
below that in the Baltic countries. Unlike in several other new EU-members states, lending
by Slovak banks is mainly funded by domestic deposits and is predominantly denominated in
domestic currency.

The fiscal outturn in 2006 was better than envisaged in the budget, but still the
stance was expansionary. The general government accounts were in a deficit of 3.4 percent
of GDP, compared with 4.2 percent targeted in the budget and an outturn of 2.8 percent of
GDP in 2005 (Table 5). The outturn for the state budget and Social Insurance Agency was
better than envisaged, but there was slippage in the performance of other levels of general
government, especially the municipalities. Accounting for net transfers from the European
Union (EU), the fiscal stimulus in 2006 amounted to 1½ percent of GDP. Collections of tax
and nontax revenues and social insurance contributions exceeded the budgeted levels by

7

(In percent of GDP)

about 2 percent of GDP, owing to
stronger-than-expected growth in the
underlying bases and one-time special
factors. There also was some
underspending in cofinancing of EUfunded projects because of shortfalls in
drawdown of funds from the EU budget.
These gains were mostly offset by
higher outlays on goods and services,
and increase in entitlements for
pensions and health benefits, and larger
subsidies to the transport sectors.

there is no effect on the fiscal deficit but there is an expansionary impact since the receipts
do not withdraw resources from the private sector like normal revenue. Payments to the EU
budget raise the measured deficit but do not increase domestic demand.

exports of cars and electronics products. Allowing for some increase in the import propensity
of domestic demand, the external current account deficit is projected to narrow progressively
to about 3½ percent of GDP in 2009—less upbeat than the official and consensus forecasts.
12.
Staff’s growth outlook is subject to balanced risks. On the upside, consumption
demand could be higher if real wage increases and demand-side impetus financed by bank
credit were greater than assumed in the staff scenario, and if household saving propensity
started to fall. In the event of stronger domestic demand, the current account deficit could
exceed staff projections. Downside risks to growth are a significant slowdown in major
markets and higher oil prices. There should be no negative implications for the euro adoption
goal if economic growth turns out lower than the staff projection since the budget is based on
conservative growth assumptions.
13.
In a context of strong growth prospects and external outlook, external debt
sustainability is not a concern. Slovakia is likely to remain an attractive destination for
foreign investors and record large surpluses in the financial account (Table 6). In addition,
the anticipated rise in corporate saving is likely to limit debt financing. Thus, in the baseline
scenario, external debt relative to GDP is projected to decline by about 13 percentage points
to 43 percent in 2012. Various stress tests indicate that Slovakia’s external debt dynamics
should remain manageable. Even under the most adverse scenario, the debt would settle at
around 63 percent of GDP over the medium term (Table 7).
14.
Barring major shocks, inflation is likely to moderate in the near term and meet
the Maastricht reference rate. The regulated utility price decreases of January 2007 will
result in a significant dampening of inflation. Given the latest World Economic Outlook
energy price projections and assuming that wage increases continue to lag productivity gains,
staff considers the NBS’s inflation projections for end-2007 (1.6 percent) and end-2008
(1.9 percent) to be realistic.1 The projections are subject to uncertainties related to
developments in world energy prices and their domestic impact and to movements in the
nominal exchange rate. Upside risks to inflation are higher consumer spending, against the
backdrop of zero slack in the economy, and wage pressures induced by a tighter labor
market. The authorities stressed that the impact of the downward adjustments in regulated
prices was sustainable in that they would not negatively affect cost recovery and the ability
of the utility companies to maintain and renew their infrastructure.

1

Subsequent to the mission, in April, the NBS lowered the end-2007 inflation projection to 1.3 percent, taking
into account recent price developments.

9
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
15.
The authorities are giving priority to euro adoption but are also committed to
socially inclusive growth. They were concerned about the rapid pace of exchange rate
appreciation and the risk of an overly strong conversion rate when the euro is adopted. They
emphasized that fiscal consolidation was a key objective and that increases in social spending
would be effected within the limits imposed by the deficit targets. However, the authorities
were inclined to devote additional revenues resulting from faster economic growth to
meeting social welfare goals. They also have taken a number of labor market policy
initiatives aimed at spreading the gains from growth to low-income earners. Staff highlighted
the risk of the public expenditure structure and the labor market becoming less flexible and,
to ensure a successful experience in the euro area, encouraged the authorities to orient
policies toward enhancing the ability of the economy to deal with shocks.
16.
Over a number of years, the authorities have implemented policies generally in
line with the Fund’s advice.
A. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
17.
The authorities noted that the revaluation of the central parity of the koruna
was justified by Slovakia’s improved economic fundamentals. The productivity growth
differential vis-à-vis the euro area had widened in 2006, and a sizeable part of the upward
pressure on the exchange rate reflected productivity-driven equilibrium real appreciation.
The authorities recognized that the parity revaluation entailed risks. It increased the room for
further appreciation within the ERM2 band and could induce additional speculative inflows.
It also increased Slovakia’s vulnerability to investor sentiment turning bearish, as the cushion
for accommodating depreciation had become smaller relative to that before the parity
adjustment. However, the authorities were optimistic that investors would increasingly
decouple the koruna from regional influences. Staff regards parity revaluation to be a
pragmatic strategy, given the reasons for the upward deviations and the objective of keeping
the exchange rate within the ERM2 band.
18.
The authorities expressed the view that an overshooting of the koruna from the
equilibrium level was likely to undermine the competitiveness of traditional
manufacturing firms as well as small and medium-sized enterprises, where productivity
gains were lower. However, staff noted the inherent difficulties of measuring equilibrium
rates in transition economies and observed that competitiveness remained satisfactory
according to most indicators. Strong productivity growth kept the unit labor cost-based real
effective exchange rate broadly stable in 2006. Moreover, with increases in real product
wages lagging productivity gains, profitability rose and continued to outpace trading partners
(Figures 4 and 5). Significantly, profitability of sectors experiencing slower export growth
was comparable to that of sectors with faster export growth. Slovakia’s export market share
has increased for all sectors in recent years, and its exports have moved up the technology

10
ladder at a faster pace than most regional peers (Figures 6 and 7). The pace of export market
penetration is likely to be sustained over the medium term on account of commencement of
production and expansion of capacity in several export-oriented projects.
19.
The NBS has persisted with foreign exchange intervention and rejection of repo
bids in open market operations for containing appreciation of the koruna. However,
these efforts have succeeded in easing pressures for only limited duration. Staff encouraged
the NBS to increase Slovakia’s resilience to speculative capital inflows by using its policy
instruments in a manner that would limit opportunities for one-way bets in the foreign
exchange market. Given the favorable inflation outlook, staff recommended that the NBS
lower its policy interest rates. Staff also saw merit in NBS officials communicating to market
participants that the terminal conversion rate could be different from the prevailing market
rate, as had been the case for Greece, Ireland, and Finland.
B. Fiscal Policy
20.
The authorities noted that the 2007–09 budget framework was aimed at meeting
the euro zone entry objective. It envisaged a general government deficit (including the
second pillar pension costs) of 2.9 percent of GDP in 2007 and consolidation thereafter of
½ percent of GDP annually to

framework.
The budget incorporates
marginal changes to the flat tax system that are not unduly distortionary—the VAT rate on
medicine and medical devices has been lowered from 19 percent to 10 percent, and standard
deductions have been reduced for higher income earners.
21.
Staff recommended a more ambitious fiscal consolidation than envisaged in the
budget framework, given the strong growth outlook and challenges in fending off
appreciation pressures. This would ensure that the Maastricht criteria on inflation, the
exchange rate, and the budget deficit are met by comfortable margins and in a sustainable
manner. The strategy to achieve additional fiscal consolidation would not necessarily require
scaling back on budgeted expenditure. Revenues are likely to exceed the budgeted levels as
economic growth is anticipated to be stronger relative to the budget assumptions.

11
Accordingly, staff encouraged the authorities to save the revenue overperformance and
ensure a better fiscal outturn. This would entail adhering to the nominal expenditure targets
specified in the budget framework.
22.
Ministry of Finance officials recognized the merits of a stronger counter-cyclical
fiscal policy, but drew attention to the political constraints. Given the emphasis in the
government’s manifesto on enhancing welfare state measures, there would be pressure for
using additional revenues resulting from faster economic growth for socially-oriented current
spending. Ministry officials noted that the state budget law for 2007 limited the extent to
which revenue overperformance could be spent without resorting to a supplementary
budget—only up to 1 percent of the budget baseline expenditure. While this could potentially
help obtain a lower-than-envisaged deficit in 2007, they did not rule out the possibility of an
upward revision of the original expenditure ceilings for 2008 and 2009 when the 2008–10
budget framework is prepared on the basis of updated macroeconomic projections.
23.
Fiscal management at local government levels will have to be made consistent
with the national fiscal consolidation strategy. The authorities explained that the slippage
in the fiscal performance of municipalities in 2006 was election related, and considered the
risk of it recurring in 2007 to be small. However, fiscal rules applicable to local governments
are based on ceilings related to their debt stock, which are currently non-binding. They do
not prevent revenue overperformance from funding additional spending and do not ensure
operation of automatic fiscal stabilizers. Also, there is no satisfactory mechanism in place for
monitoring fiscal developments of local governments. Accordingly, staff recommended that
fiscal rules applicable to local governments be amended with the aim of strengthening
expenditure control and enhancing fiscal flexibility. Until these measures became effective,
staff suggested use of moral suasion to avoid any borrowing for expenditures beyond the
budgeted levels and to save any revenue overperformance.
24.
The expenditure program in the 2007–09 budget framework does not identify
how the announced policy priorities will be sustained beyond 2007. Some of the new
social expenditure policy initiatives are not fully funded, and their full implementation would
cost 0.4–0.5 percent of GDP more annually than provided for in the budget framework. The
authorities indicated that higher expenditure on social policy priorities would be
accommodated through efficiency gains in government spending, streamlining public
administration, and stronger revenue performance. They acknowledged that a key challenge

12
was to contain costs in the health care
system.2 However, they downplayed
staff’s concern about possible increase
in demand for doctor’s consultations and
outpatient contacts following the recent
elimination of co-payments. The
authorities stated that the details of
public administration reform and a
comprehensive medium-term
expenditure program would be
elaborated in the 2008–10 budget
framework.
25.
Staff expressed concern that
the rising share of non-discretionary
expenditure would reduce budgetary
flexibility. Creating space for the
growing co-financing of EU-funded
projects as well as fiscal adjustment in
the event of shocks would become more
difficult. While acknowledging that
capital expenditure can also help
achieve social welfare goals, the
authorities did not foresee a quick shift
in the composition of expenditure.
26.
The drawdown of EU funds has
fallen short of the budgeted levels.
While Slovakia compares favorably with
neighboring countries in the overall
absorption of EU funds, it fares poorly in
the utilization of cohesion funds. The
authorities noted that the current
legislation on land acquisition and
procedures for construction permits
hindered drawdown of EU funds for
infrastructure projects and needed to be
urgently reviewed.

27.
Public debt sustainability is not a concern. At end-2006, general government debt
stood at 30¾ percent of GDP. This is both within a safe range for an emerging market and
below the Maastricht limit. Assuming the structural deficit trend specified in the latest
Convergence Program update, the debt ratio is projected to decline by 7¾ percentage points
to 23 percent of GDP by 2012. Aging-related fiscal pressure is anticipated only in the longer
term, from 2020 onward. Vulnerability of debt to changes in inflation, interest rates, and the
exchange rate is low (Table 8).
C. Wage and Labor Market Issues
28.
Recent labor market policy initiatives aimed at addressing income inequality
could increase wage drift and undermine wage flexibility.
•

The authorities increased the minimum wage by 10 percent in October 2006, and the
government manifesto calls for further increases in the minimum wage relative to the
average wage. They are giving consideration to establishing formula-based guidelines
for increases in the minimum wage. Staff urged the authorities to retain discretion for
determining minimum wage increases and adopt a cautious stance, as the pace
influenced wage negotiations in the private sector although a large part of wage
setting was decentralized. Staff also noted that the introduction of an earned income
credit for low-income workers would be a better option to guarantee a minimum
living standard than further increases in the minimum wage. Implementation of this
measure would enhance the incentive to participate in the labor market without
having any negative impact on the demand for labor.

•

In a reversal of the reform measure implemented in 2004, a recent amendment to the
collective bargaining law has made sectoral wage agreements binding for all
enterprises in the sector. Opposition parties and employer groups have petitioned the
Constitutional Court on the validity of the amendment. Staff noted that the
amendment would be particularly painful to smaller enterprises and would reinforce
the negative effect of rapid exchange rate appreciation. It would also reduce the scope
for regional wage differentiation that is desirable because of the large regional
differences in employment rates. The authorities explained that the amended law
allows individual firms to seek a waiver on socio-economic grounds. They also noted
their intention to establish a tripartite Social Pact that would include a provision for
wage moderation.

29.
The government is seeking to amend the Labor Code with the aim of increasing
employee protection and aligning it to the European social model. However, the draft
legislation submitted to parliament does not have the full backing of the junior coalition
partners and may be subject to change. Employers’ associations and major FDI-supported
enterprises remain opposed to the proposed changes, arguing that they would increase labor
costs and worsen the business environment.

14
30.
Addressing regional disparities and the high unemployment problem are
continuing challenges. The benefits of rapid economic growth appears to have by-passed
three regions in central and eastern Slovakia, where employment growth has been small and
the unemployment rate remains sticky around 20 percent. Active labor market policy
(ALMP) schemes have been less effective3 in the three lagging regions than in the rest of the
country. The authorities indicated that new ALMP tools will be added from January 2008 to
raise the employability of job seekers and to increase the incentives for employers to employ
disadvantaged groups. They noted that the new scheme of investment incentives was aimed
at supporting job creation in the underdeveloped regions. The authorities also plan to increase
investment in infrastructure in these regions, strengthen the regional transport systems, and
improve the quality of tertiary and vocational education, supported by contributions from the
EU.

D. Financial Sector Issues
31.
The banking system, which is almost entirely foreign-owned, is currently
healthy. A recent FSAP update mission found that banks are adequately capitalized and
profitable, and asset quality remains high (Table 9). Stress tests indicate that banks remain
resilient to a range of possible adverse shocks.4 However, continued rapid credit growth has
increased banks’ exposure to credit risk and their vulnerability to swings in the economic

15
cycle. NBS officials deemed risk management practices of banks to be generally adequate.
Noting that the lowering of policy interest rates to counter appreciation pressures may also
provide additional impetus to credit growth, staff stressed the need to closely monitor bank
loan portfolios and to tighten prudential requirements if necessary.
32.
In 2006, the NBS unified supervision of the entire financial sector. The non-bank
financial sector is relatively small but growing rapidly. NBS officials indicated that the riskbased forward-looking approach of supervision was now fully operational in the non-bank
financial sector. The FSAP update mission determined that the NBS is well prepared to cope
with the challenges resulting from the implementation of the Basel II supervision framework
from January 2007. NBS officials regularly interacted with home country supervisors at
different levels, but they acknowledged the importance of improving coordination further.
Staff encouraged the authorities to implement in a timely fashion the recommendations of the
MONEYVAL report to improve the anti-money laundering regime.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
Slovakia is reaping the benefits of sound policies over the past few years.
Reforms of the tax and welfare systems, financial sector, and the labor market have increased
the incentives to work, improved the business climate, and enhanced the flexibility of the
economy. These measures together with prudent macroeconomic management and large FDI
inflows have supported progressive strengthening of economic growth and increasing export
orientation, making Slovakia one of the top performers in the region. The new government’s
commitment to the continuation of policies aimed at ensuring euro adoption in January 2009
has secured investor confidence and should help sustain this status.
34.
Slovakia is well poised to adopt the euro, but challenges lie ahead. The near-term
inflation outlook has improved and the Maastricht reference rate seems within reach. The
2007–09 budget framework is aimed at meeting the euro zone entry objective. However, a
key challenge is to satisfy the test of exchange rate stability under ERM2, as the evolution of
the koruna is influenced not only by Slovakia’s economic fundamentals but also by swings in
investor sentiment in the region. Another challenge is to put in place adjustment
mechanisms—wage and labor market flexibility and the capacity to run countercyclical fiscal
policy—prior to adopting the euro. This will ensure that asymmetric shocks can be
effectively absorbed in the absence of a national monetary policy. Thus, a continued focus on
fiscal prudence and structural reforms will remain essential. The increased social orientation
of policies that the authorities are also aiming for will need to be carefully meshed into this
framework.
35.
Monetary policy priorities have shifted to containing exchange rate appreciation
and keeping the rate within the ERM2 band. Slovakia’s improved economic outlook and
favorable prospects for euro adoption may create a tendency for upward pressure on the
currency with the potential for overshooting and volatility. The koruna’s recent firming does

16
not appear to pose a significant threat to competitiveness. However, further rapid
appreciation of the koruna could be disruptive for small and medium-sized exporters. The
NBS should use its policy instruments in a manner that will limit opportunities for one-way
bets in the foreign exchange market. Given the favorable inflation outlook, the NBS should
lower its policy rates instead of persisting with the rejection of repo bids to contain
appreciation pressures.
36.
A tighter fiscal stance than envisaged in the budget is desirable, given the robust
growth prospects and the persistence of appreciation pressures. Such a strategy would
also facilitate the achievement of euro zone norms on a sustainable basis. Ensuring a better
fiscal outturn will require safeguarding the revenue overperformance that is anticipated
because of a stronger economic growth outlook, and adhering to the original medium-term
expenditure ceilings. It will also be important to strengthen fiscal management of local
governments and improve policy coordination across all levels of government.
37.
The medium-term expenditure framework should be strengthened to reflect
policy objectives clearly and to enhance fiscal flexibility. The authorities have initiated
background work to increase spending efficiency and streamline public administration. It will
be important to follow through with these plans in a decisive manner. However, increased
socially-oriented current spending is likely to make the public expenditure structure more
rigid. Capital expenditure can also help achieve social welfare goals while increasing the
long-term growth potential and widening the discretionary scope for fiscal policy. More
emphasis should be put on reducing income inequalities by channeling resources toward
employment promotion and investment in infrastructure in underdeveloped regions. Priority
should be given to eliminating the bottlenecks that hinder drawdown of EU funds for
infrastructure projects, and space should be created for the growing co-financing of EUfunded projects.
38.
Wage moderation and flexibility in wage setting procedures would contribute
importantly to containing inflationary pressures and safeguarding competitiveness. In
this regard, the recent legislation that extends sectoral wage agreements to all firms in the
sector is worrisome. The authorities should avoid further large increases in the minimum
wage as it would lead to wage drift and may harm employment prospects of low-skilled
workers.
39.
Slovakia continues to face considerable challenges in the labor market. Reforms
implemented in 2003–04 and stronger GDP growth have contributed to a pick up in the
employment rate, but the unemployment rate remains high among the low-skilled and in the
less-advanced regions. Active labor market policy schemes have been relatively ineffective
in lowering unemployment in these regions, and need to be improved. Consideration should
be given to introducing earned income credit for low-income workers, with a view to
stimulating job creation and further increasing incentive to work. The authorities should also

17
ensure that the amendments to the labor code do not lead to higher labor costs and reduce
labor market flexibility.
40.
The financial system is in good health, but faces challenges. The increasing
exposure of banks to credit risk requires close monitoring. Given the high foreign ownership
of banks and the recent introduction of the Basel II framework, it will be important to
strengthen cooperation and exchange of information with home country supervisors, and to
develop arrangements for coordinated remedial actions for dealing with problem banks. The
extension of a risk-based approach of supervision to non-bank financial institutions is
welcome. The NBS is encouraged to address the remaining gaps in the anti-money
laundering regime, taking into account the recommendations of MONEYVAL.
41.
It is recommended that the Article IV consultation with Slovakia remain on the
standard 12-month cycle.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
4/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
5/ Real GDP growth drops to 4 percent throughout 2008-12.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and both non-interest current account and nondebt inflows in percent of GDP) remain
at their levels of the last projection year.

The currency of the Slovak Republic is the Slovak koruna (Sk). Slovak Republic joined the
ERM2 on November 28, 2005 at the central parity of Sk 38.455 per euro. Since ERM2 entry,
the koruna has appreciated and the central parity was revalued to Sk 35.4424 per euro with
effect from March 19, 2007. The exchange rate stood at Sk 33.667 per euro on April 27,
2007. The exchange rate regime is currently classified as pegged exchange rate within
horizontal band. Slovak Republic aims to adopt the euro in January 2009.
The Slovak Republic has accepted the obligations of Article VIII and maintains an exchange
system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions. The Slovak Republic maintains exchange restrictions for security
reasons, based on UN Security Council Resolutions and Council of the European Union
Regulations, that have been notified to the Fund for approval (see most recently, EBD/07/38,
3/23/2007) under the procedures set forth in Executive Board Decision No. 144–(52/51).
VIII.

Article IV Consultation:
The consultation discussions were held in Bratislava during February 28–March 13, 2007.
The mission met with Minister of Finance Počiatek, National Bank of Slovakia (NBS)
Governor Šramko, Minister of Economy Jahnátek, other senior government and NBS

3
officials, parliamentarians, and representatives of financial institutions, think tanks, trade
unions and employers’ association.
The mission comprised Messrs Banerjee (head), Konuki, Dalgic (all EUR), and Lugaresi
(FAD expert). Messrs Kiekens (Executive Director for Slovakia), Jakoby (Advisor to the
Executive Director for Slovakia), Rosenberg, and Tirpak (both from Regional Representative
Office in Warsaw) participated in the discussions.
A joint press briefing was held at the end of the mission. The mission’s concluding statement
was published on the IMF website. The authorities have agreed to the publication of the staff
report.
The previous consultation with the Slovak Republic was concluded on March 20, 2006
(IMF Country Report No. 06/119). The chairman’s summing up of the discussion was
circulated as SUR06/33.
IX.

FSAP Participation and ROSCs:
An FSAP was concluded with the completion of the 2002 Article IV consultation on August
7, 2002 on the basis of missions that took place in February 2002 and April 2002. The FSSA
report was published (IMF Country Report No. 02/198). An FSAP update mission was held
in December 2006. The FSSA update report will be circulated to the Executive Board
together with the staff report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation.
The report on the Fiscal ROSC was issued in August 2002 (IMF Country Report No. 02/189)
and updates were issued in August 2003 (IMF Country Report No. 03/236) and in March
2005 (IMF Country Report No. 05/73). The report on the Data ROSC was issued in May
2005 (IMF Country Report No. 05/161).

Appendix II. Slovak Republic: Statistical Issues
1.
Coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of data provided to the Fund are adequate
for surveillance purposes. From the point of view of macroeconomic analysis and policy
making, significant data improvements have been made in recent years, particularly in the
national accounts. A data ROSC mission during February–March 2004 found that the
integrity, methodological soundness, and reliability of the data were satisfactory, despite
some shortcomings in the data revision policy. The main issues remaining are: (i) weaknesses
in the data on prices and volumes of imports and exports; (ii) a lack of timely data on the
general government operations; and (iii) slow compilation cycle of the annual national
accounts and lack of proper benchmarking of quarterly data. The Slovak Republic subscribes
to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since 1996 and observes or exceeds all
related standards.
2.
With regard to timeliness and public access, the authorities in general follow a
free and open data publication policy. Data are promptly released to news services, and are
also published regularly in various monthly and quarterly statistical publications, and on the
Internet2 according to a pre-announced schedule. Data on core surveillance variables are
provided regularly to the Fund, and with minimal lags: a week or less for foreign exchange
reserves; a day for monthly state budget implementation data; 10 days to a month for
consumer prices, reserve money, broad money, and interest rates; two months for foreign
trade data; and about three months for other fiscal, balance of payments, and national
accounts data. However, the 2004 data ROSC mission reported some difficulties in fully
reconciling the balance of payments with the national accounts, monetary, and government
finance statistics.
Real Sector and Prices
3.
Significant progress has been made in the compilation of the national accounts
statistics. However, the quarterly national accounts data on expenditures exhibit weaknesses
and there is a significant statistical discrepancy between the supply side and the demand side.
An important outstanding issue is the compilation of reliable price deflators for imports and
exports that would enable better decomposition into volume and price changes. The unit
value trade price indices—on which the national accounts trade price deflators are based—
are published with long delays and are not appropriately adjusted for quality changes. The
statistical authorities are aware of these issues and improvements are pending.
4.
Following the fast development of chain stores, which are not fully captured in
surveys, the authorities consider that retail sales and the level of consumption might be
biased (especially if compared to VAT receipts), and wage statistics also might be biased.
————————————

2

Data are available on the website of the Slovak Statistics Office (www.statistics.sk), the National Bank of
Slovakia (NBS) (www.nbs.sk), and the Ministry of Finance (MoF) (www.finance.gove.sk).

6
5.
In the enterprise sector, it would be very useful if the line ministries produced
systematic accounts of the financial positions of the public enterprises under their purview.
Fiscal Sector
6.
General government statistics are compiled annually in accordance with the
methodology of the ESA95, and disseminated on the Ministry of Finance (MOF) website. In
accordance with the EU acquis communautaire, the authorities report semi-annually on
general government net lending/borrowing on ESA95 basis. Monthly reconciliation of
government operations above and below-the-line is restricted to state budget transactions on
a cash basis. A modern treasury system has been operating since January 2004. The new
system has improved fiscal control and public debt management by allowing the recording of
expenditures at the planning and commitment stages.
7.
The MOF has converted its fiscal accounts to ESA95 standards. The MOF
compiles Government Finance Statistics according to the Government Finance Statistics
Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) analytical framework; data are available and disseminated on a
cash basis for 1996–05, and on an accrual basis for 2003–05.
External Sector
8.
The monthly balance of payments are provided in a timely manner. The balance
of payments is compiled and disseminated quarterly on a cumulative basis during the year;
however, dissemination on a cumulative basis does not follow best practice. Weekly reports
of information on gross international reserves are timely. Moreover, the NBS revised in 2002
its methodology for reporting foreign exchange reserves in line with IMF guidelines and
STA technical recommendations to include the valuation of gold at market prices and to
change the reporting of repo operations and gold swaps. Also, the reporting of foreign
exchange reserves by commercial banks has been revised to include selected long-term assets
in the item “foreign exchange reserves.” Banks are now reporting their arbitrage transactions
accurately. Improvements have also been made in reporting nonresidents’ claims and
liabilities in domestic currency. Remaining problem areas include: (i) the measurement of
inward portfolio investment; (ii) the need for more detailed and timely information on
publicly guaranteed external debt; (iii) more timely reporting of information on external debt,
including short-term debt; (iv) the recording of most interest payments on a cash basis; and
(v) the need to improve data compilation on the composition of exports.
Monetary Sector
9.
Monetary statistics are of good quality, and are reported on a timely basis to the
Fund. The 2004 data ROSC mission found that the two sets of monetary data compiled by
the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS)—the national monetary statistics (NMS), for internal
use, and the harmonized monetary statistics (HMS), submitted to international
organizations—are broadly in line with the IMF Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual.
One exception was the treatment, in the NMS, of government’s foreign liabilities as part of
the NBS foreign liabilities, with a counterpart adjustment in NBS claims on the government.

7
In response to the mission’s comments, the authorities changed this treatment to exclude
government foreign liabilities from NBS foreign liabilities. Another exception was the
exclusion of money market funds from the NMS, but the authorities started including these
funds as a memorandum item in the NMS. A third exception is that market valuation is not
applied to certain financial instruments under both the NMS and HMS.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with the Slovak
Republic
On June 6, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Slovak Republic.1
Background
Economic performance strengthened further in 2006. Real GDP growth accelerated to 8¼
percent supported by strong productivity gains. Domestic demand remained robust, while the
contribution of net foreign demand rose. Exports increased sharply, as exports of cars and
durable consumption goods speeded up, and outpaced imports. However, because of a
deterioration of terms of trade, the external current account narrowed only marginally to 8¼
percent of GDP. Much of the external deficit was covered by inflows of foreign direct
investment.
Strong economic growth boosted employment and the unemployment rate fell sharply to 13¼
percent. Despite the strengthening labor demand, real wage increases moderated and lagged
productivity gains. Thus, profitability continued to rise.
Inflation was on an upward path for much of 2006, but this trend reversed in the fourth quarter.
Harmonized consumer price inflation reached 5 percent in July-August 2006 but declined
subsequently to 2 percent in February-April 2007. Inflation developments were influenced by

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

trends in world energy prices, the unwinding of the base effects of the large increases in
regulated utility prices in October 2005, and decreases in regulated prices in January 2007.
The National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) has been following a hybrid monetary framework
focused on restraining inflation and on maintaining the exchange rate within the Exchange
Rate Mechanism 2 (ERM2) requirements. Concerns about a negative inflation outlook
prompted the NBS to raise its policy interest rate in four steps by a total of 175 basis points
during the first three quarters of 2006. During May-July 2006, negative investor sentiment on
emerging markets and concerns about the election outcome and courses of policies led to
depreciation pressures on the koruna. In July 2006, the NBS intervened heavily in the foreign
exchange rate market to stem depreciation pressures when the koruna dropped below the
central parity under ERM2.
Favorable growth and export performance and positive investor sentiment toward the region
led to appreciation pressures from October 2006 onward. In end-December, as the koruna
approached the upper edge of the ERM2 band, the NBS began countering appreciation
pressures through interventions and prolonged rejection of bids during repo auctions.
Eventually in mid-March 2007, with appreciation pressures persisting, the central parity was
revalued with the approval of the European Union member states by 8.5 percent. The NBS
has continued to counter appreciation pressures since the parity revaluation and has held the
koruna at around 6 percent above the new central parity. With inflation declining markedly in
the first quarter of 2007 and judging upside risks to be low, the NBS lowered its policy rate by
50 basis points in two steps since late March.
The general government deficit in 2006, estimated at 3.4 percent of GDP, was smaller than
envisaged in the budget. Collections of tax and non-tax revenues and social insurance
contributions surpassed the budgeted levels. There was also some underspending in
cofinancing of EU-funds projects because of shortfalls in drawdown of funds from the EU
budget. These gains were mostly offset by higher outlays on goods and services, pensions
and health benefits, and transport subsidies.
Growth is projected to remain strong during 2007–09. The commencement of production and
increasing capacity in export-oriented projects and increased downstream integration with
domestic supply chains will be the main engines of growth. The current account deficit is
expected to narrow progressively over the medium term. Slovakia is well poised to adopt the
euro in January 2009. Barring major shocks, the Maastricht inflation criterion seems within
reach, and the 2007–09 budget framework aims at meeting the euro zone objectives.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Slovakia’s strong economic performance in recent years,
which was underpinned by prudent macroeconomic management, a wide range of structural
reforms, and increasing integration with the EU. Directors welcomed the new government’s
commitment to continue policies aimed at ensuring euro adoption in January 2009.

3
Looking forward, Directors concurred that Slovakia is well poised to adopt the euro, although
several challenges remain. Chief among them are to satisfy the test of exchange rate stability
under ERM2, to enhance fiscal and labor market flexibility to allow the economy to absorb
shocks in the monetary union, and to continue with structural reforms to sustain growth and
further reduce unemployment. Directors also noted that the authorities’ objective of socially
inclusive growth would need to be coordinated with the policy framework for euro zone entry
and strong performance in the monetary union.
Directors agreed that the current level of competitiveness was satisfactory. However, they
observed that the favorable prospects for growth and euro adoption may generate further
currency appreciation pressure with potential for volatility and overshooting. Directors
encouraged the NBS to conduct its policy, and its communications with market participants, in
a manner that would limit opportunities for one-way bets in the foreign exchange market.
Given the favorable inflation outlook, some Directors also saw scope for prudently lowering the
policy interest rate. However, a number of other Directors stressed the need for caution in
considering further easing monetary policy, noting that there are still risks for the inflation
outlook given that the economy is operating at or near full capacity, and that the interest rate
spread to the euro area is already low.
Directors recommended a more ambitious fiscal consolidation than envisaged in the 20072009 budgetary framework, to ensure that fiscal policy remains consistent with the Maastricht
deficit limit, to contain potential re-emerging inflationary pressures, and to counter further
currency appreciation pressures. They called on the authorities to save revenue windfalls, and
to adhere to the existing medium-term expenditure ceilings. Directors stressed the need to
bolster the fiscal management of local governments and to improve policy coordination among
different levels of government, to ensure achievement of the national fiscal consolidation
objective.
Directors highlighted the importance of strengthening the medium-term expenditure
framework. They welcomed the initiation of background work by the authorities to increase
spending efficiency and to streamline public administration, and, in this context, called for
efforts to increase efficiency and contain costs in the health care system. Given that higher
socially-oriented current spending would reduce expenditure flexibility, Directors
recommended putting greater emphasis on infrastructure spending and on employment
promotion in the underdeveloped regions of Slovakia.
Directors emphasized that wage moderation and flexibility in wage-setting procedures are
essential to restrain inflation and maintain competitiveness. In this regard, the recent
legislation that extended sectoral wage agreements to all firms in the sector was a source of
concern. Directors also cautioned against further large increases in the minimum wage, as
they could lead to wage drift and worsen employment prospects for low-skilled workers.
In view of the still high unemployment rate among the low-skilled and in the less-developed
regions, Directors saw a need to improve the effectiveness of active labor market policy
schemes. They also stressed the importance of ensuring that the labor code amendments
under consideration would not raise labor costs and reduce labor market flexibility. Directors

4
encouraged the authorities to give consideration to introducing an earned-income tax credit for
low-income workers, as this would enhance job creation and increase incentives to work.
Directors welcomed the finding that Slovakia’s financial system is generally sound and resilient
to adverse shocks, while supporting continued efforts to further enhance financial institution
supervision. They called for close monitoring of banks’ loan portfolios, as continued rapid
credit growth has increased banks’ exposure to credit risks. Given the high foreign ownership
of banks, further strengthening of cooperation with home country supervisors should also
remain a priority. Directors commended the strengthening of the regime against money
laundering and terrorism financing, and encouraged the authorities to move expeditiously to
address the remaining gaps.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
