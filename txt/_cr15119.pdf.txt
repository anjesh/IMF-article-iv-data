STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context: Since the last Article IV consultation in November 2013, a large bank failure
and a weakening in the fiscal balance have tested Bulgaria’s hard-won macroeconomic
and financial stability. Growth last year was broadly in line with projections, but deflation
has been deeper than expected. Looking forward, risks to the outlook have increased.
Political divisions and unaddressed governance issues have raised concerns about the
prospects for actions needed to set macro-financial policies firmly back on track and to
tackle structural rigidities. Weak external demand and regional tensions further weigh on
activity, with limited relief from lower commodity prices. Developments in Greece
contribute to uncertainty.
Key policy issues: The Article IV discussions focused on immediate policy actions to
reduce macro-financial uncertainty and on medium-term reforms to support income
convergence. Specifically,


Financial sector. Decisive policy action—including through an independent asset
quality review (AQR) and more forceful steps to support confidence in supervision,
strengthen the resolution framework, ensure an adequate financial safety net, and
address system-wide accountability—is needed. Further steps to manage NPLs and
advance corporate deleveraging are also critical.



Fiscal policy. While plans for fiscal consolidation following the 2014 slippage are
welcome, a more ambitious path should be considered. Faster consolidation would
provide room for additional spending in the event of a modest negative output
shock and preserve space to cope with contingent risks—particularly important in
the context of Bulgaria’s currency board arrangement (CBA). Staff called for a
thorough assessment of the impact of pension reforms currently under discussion.



Structural agenda. Priority reforms include addressing gaps in health, education,
infrastructure, and energy markets, as well as the fundamental concerns related to
corruption and cronyism.

Past IMF advice: Previous advice, focused on the need to address structural gaps
(including related to governance) to set the foundation for stronger growth and job
creation, remains valid, with policy implementation in these areas having stalled. Past
advice also pointed to the need for increased attention to medium-term fiscal risks,
notably concerning the sustainability of the pension system.

CONTEXT: POLICY CREDIBILITY AND ECONOMIC STABILITY AT RISK
1.
Bulgaria’s reputation for macro-financial stability came under scrutiny in 2014. The
year was marked by a severe test to the banking system and a sharp deterioration in the hitherto
strong fiscal stance. Political turbulence and unaddressed governance issues heightened concerns
about the direction of macro-financial policy, increasing strain on the economic outlook. The difficult
external environment further weighed on economic activity. These developments led S&P to
downgrade Bulgaria’s credit rating to below investment grade and triggered the EC’s February 2015
decision to step up the macroeconomic imbalances procedure for Bulgaria.1

accelerate productivity growth, and resume
convergence to EU income levels.
3.

Against this background, the Article IV discussion focused on twin objectives:



Addressing near-term risks: Immediate policy steps are critical to rebuild buffers against
potential shocks. In particular, the authorities’ short-term strategy should address uncertainty
concerning the financial sector and set the fiscal program firmly back on track.



Rebuilding reform momentum. While macro-financial stability is necessary for growth, it is not
sufficient. In line with past IMF advice, jumpstarting stalled structural reforms to strengthen
human capital, improve infrastructure, and address institutional weaknesses and broader
governance concerns is critical.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
Notwithstanding significant political and financial turbulence, growth in 2014 was broadly in line with
earlier projections. Nevertheless, risks to the outlook have increased, reflecting sustained domestic
uncertainty and a weaker external environment.
1

As a result, the EC will carry out specific monitoring of the policies recommended by the Council, including regular
reviews of progress in the relevant EU committees.

Despite a challenging environment, the economy expanded modestly last year, led by
domestic demand. Export-driven recovery in 2013 proved short-lived as growth in European trading
partners remained subdued. Nevertheless, sustained political uncertainty and the June bank failure
did not prevent an improvement in domestic demand in the latter part of 2014, which was supported
by an expansionary fiscal stance and rising absorption of EU funds. Unemployment declined, but
remained high.

Deflationary pressures have
continued. Inflation turned negative in the
second half of 2013, driven by declining
import prices and administrative price
reductions, and deepened in 2014, with low
growth in Europe, plunging commodity prices,
and timid domestic demand recovery.2
Headline and core consumer prices both
declined by an average 1.6 percent last year,
among the sharpest price level contractions in
the EU.

6.
The current account registered a small surplus in 2014. Net exports declined with
decelerating growth in export partners. Financial flows, mainly FDI, remained modest. External debt
increased slightly, to about 90 percent of GDP, but reserves remain comfortable based on standard
metrics (Appendix II).

Growth is projected to moderate before increasing gradually into the medium-term:
For 2015, real GDP is projected to expand by
1¼ percent, supported by continued modest growth
in private consumption and continued high EU funds
absorption. While the sizable corporate debt
overhang and high non-performing loans will
continue to weigh on private investment, it is
projected to stabilize after a 5-year contraction. Net

exports are expected to have a largely neutral effect on growth as the impact of lower oil prices
on imports is offset by subdued external demand.


While there is no strong evidence of a misalignment in Bulgaria’s external position (Appendix I),
lack of structural reforms to improve Bulgaria’s productivity and subdued growth prospects in
the region are projected in the baseline to limit net exports’ contribution to growth over the
medium term. More broadly, convergence to EU income levels will remain slow, with growth
gradually reaching only 2½ percent and unemployment declining to about 8 percent. While
year-on-year inflation is expected to turn positive late this year (driven by EU price levels and
higher administered prices), it will remain subdued, rising slightly above the EU average in the
medium term. A small current account deficit is projected into the medium term, with external
debt slowly declining below 80 percent of GDP (Appendix III).

8.

Risks to the outlook, as summarized in the Risk Assessment Matrix, have increased:



On the domestic side, the minority coalition government may face challenges in pushing
through the difficult measures needed to reduce macro-financial risks and raise growth.
Sustained disinflationary pressures could adversely affect the fiscal accounts. High corporate
debt and NPLs (as well as associated encumbered collateral) could act as an additional drag on
future investment and growth if not addressed. Alternatively, ambitious steps to restore policy
credibility and restart structural reforms would create a more supportive environment for growth.



On the external side, a protracted slowdown in Europe would hinder export performance. While
inward spillovers from geo-political tensions related to Russia and Ukraine have been limited to
date, effects on trade and investment may increase in 2015. Although external debt
vulnerabilities remain manageable, risks from renewed financial stress in the euro area could rise.
In this context, given the still significant presence of Greek banks in Bulgaria, close monitoring
and readiness to mitigate potential contagion from adverse developments in Greece remains
key.3 Faster recovery in Europe, supported, for example, by ECB QE and lower commodity prices,
could improve Bulgaria’s growth prospects.

3

While Greek banks’ affiliates in Bulgaria account for nearly 25 percent of total banking assets, since 2009, they have
rebalanced their funding toward local depositors, reducing Bulgaria’s foreign banking exposure to parent banks.

Authorities’ views
9.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment of the outlook. The near-term
growth projections underlying the budget are more conservative than staff’s; the authorities noted in
this context that envisaged fiscal consolidation was likely to dampen domestic demand. Given
encouraging high frequency indicators, however, they raised their projections for 2015–16 following
the mission to levels slightly above staff’s. They shared staff’s views on the medium-term outlook
and broadly agreed on potential risks. However, they noted several mitigating factors, such as
reduced political uncertainty domestically and favorable market conditions externally. They
emphasized their commitment to the announced fiscal plan, steps to reinforce confidence in the
financial sector, and broader structural reforms, discussed below. The successful Eurobond issuance
in March has largely met their external financing needs in 2015. They recognized the importance of
close monitoring of developments in Greece, including with relation to the financial sector, and
noted the continued, strong liquidity position of the banking system. Finally, they stressed that rapid
wage growth in recent years has been largely driven by non-tradable service sectors, thus limiting
adverse impacts on competitiveness.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS: TACKLING NEAR-TERM RISKS, RESTORING
BUFFERS, AND REBUILDING REFORM MOMENTUM
A. Safeguarding Financial Sector Stability
The failure of Corporate Commercial Bank (KTB) last summer exposed shortcomings in Bulgaria’s
supervision and crisis management frameworks, while also highlighting the link between financial and
fiscal risks under the currency board. Decisive action is needed to improve financial sector supervision
and secure confidence in the banking system. At the same time, strengthened measures to reduce NPLs
and address the corporate debt overhang are needed.
Background
10.
The banking system has shown substantial resilience to the damage to confidence
resulting from the failure of KTB (Appendix IV). Strong system liquidity, along with the state
liquidity support scheme introduced by the BNB and government (and extended to the largest
domestic bank, First Investment Bank, FIB) helped calm depositors, averting system-wide spillovers.
The injection of state funds into the deposit insurance fund (BDIF) also allowed for the payment of
KTB insured deposits in December. Significant system liquidity has been maintained subsequent to
the KTB failure, with positive year-on-year deposit growth at year-end 2014.
11.
The KTB failure highlighted important gaps in financial sector oversight and the crisis
management framework. External audits conducted while the bank was under conservatorship
identified serious weaknesses in credit underwriting, related-party lending, and adherence to IFRS
standards for nonperforming assets and loan-loss provisions, which were not identified by
supervisors or KTB’s auditors. Shortcomings in the legal framework for bank resolution also

BULGARIA

narrowed available options and contributed to substantial delays in KTB resolution and the payout of
insured deposits.
12.
While reported capital buffers in the
banking system are adequate in aggregate,
balance-sheet repair is advancing only slowly.5
As of 2014Q4, aggregate CT1 and total capital ratios
in the banking system were 20 and 22 percent,
respectively. System-wide NPLs remained relatively
flat at 16.7 percent (9.5 percent, net of reported
provisions), with coverage of 58.4 percent. Credit
growth remained sluggish, at 1 percent on an
annual basis (adjusted for KTB).

13.
High non-financial corporate indebtedness remains a key challenge. 6 Bulgaria’s
corporate sector is among the most leveraged among new member states (NMS). Liabilities rose
sharply during the pre-crisis boom and have declined only modestly since 2008. The high debt
overhang heightens the risk of corporate bankruptcies in the event of negative shocks and acts as a
drag on corporate profitability and investment. With corporate debt accounting for over 55 percent
of banks’ domestic loans, it also weighs on banks’ balance sheets through increasing NPLs. While
available data suggest average income coverage ratios are adequate, there is great heterogeneity at
the firm level, with a significant number of firms presenting ratios below precautionary levels.

confirmation of individuals with a clear mandate to support a strong, independent, and accountable
BNB is critical. At the same time, while several specific actions have been announced, further details
and decisive follow-up is essential to restore confidence in financial system oversight:


Improving supervision. The joint IMF/World Bank Basel Core Principles (BCP) Assessment,
expected to be completed by midyear, should help identify areas for improvement in the
supervisory framework for banks. This should be complemented by a candid, in-depth and
independent review by outside banking experts of past supervisory activity, aimed at
strengthening supervisory processes and drawing on lessons from the KTB case. An independent
expert review of the Financial Supervision Commission’s (FSC) supervisory framework would also
be useful to reinforce confidence across the financial system.7



Strengthening system-wide accountability. Concrete plans should be developed by the
Commission of Public Oversight of Statutory Auditors (which also would benefit from
independent expert input) to enhance the oversight and accountability of external parties
conducting statutory audits. Based on inputs from the reviews noted above, the authorities
should also consider strengthening BNB/FSC supervisory powers to investigate related-party
lending. In addition, staff recommended specific steps to reinforce the supervisory enforcement
culture. In this context, a formal enforcement policy is recommended, linking supervisory findings
to specific remedial actions and establishing procedures for appropriate exceptions. Significant
increases in sanctions across the oversight framework should also be considered to produce the
desired deterrent effect.



Strengthening the resolution framework. Last year’s events demonstrated that Bulgaria's legal
framework does not give the authorities adequate resolution tools. As such, timely transposition
of the EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) into national law this summer is critical
to address the gaps in the resolution and crisis management toolkit, and to provide for
coordinated and timely remedial actions.



Ensuring an adequate financial safety net. Staff discussed with the authorities the revised BDIF
law to address gaps revealed by the KTB situation,8 including by facilitating timelier payout of
insured deposits and emphasized that the law will need to be harmonized with that
implementing the BRRD. Staff also welcomed the authorities’ intention to promptly recapitalize
the BDIF following the payout of insured KTB deposits.



Assessing banks. The planned AQR is an important step to strengthen confidence in banks.
Success will depend in part on establishing a clear timetable and affirming specific modalities for
an arms-length and transparent process. Consistent with international practices, the authorities
should develop a well-defined communication strategy and contingency plans in case

7

Also in relation to the FSC, the authorities should consider compensation arrangements to support acquiring and
retaining the expertise needed to fulfill its mission.

Technical assistance by the World Bank, including through their assessment of the International Association of
Deposit Insurers (IADI) core principles, is ongoing to assist the authorities in this area.

recapitalization needs materialize. The review will also provide useful inputs for a comprehensive
risk and vulnerability assessment that will be undertaken by the IMF-WB Financial Sector
Assessment Program.


Enhancing access to information. While the BNB publishes a significant amount of financial
data, mechanisms to promote availability and ready access to more bank-level data could
facilitate analysis by interested parties and reduce uncertainty.

15.
The systemic nature of the high private sector debt overhang and NPL problem in
Bulgaria calls for a comprehensive strategy:


Proactive steps by the BNB to ensure proper identification of NPLs and promote effective
write-offs (and disposal of encumbered collateral) are critical to advance balance sheet clean-up
and mitigate asset price uncertainty. Ongoing supervisory initiatives by the BNB to promote
phased increases in provisioning in line with the aging of NPLs in selected banks are welcome,
but staff noted that a more systematic approach might be warranted, for example, by
introducing specific guidelines as done recently in other countries, including Romania. The BNB
could complement these efforts with a systematic review—possibly with support from external
workout specialists—of banks’ debt recovery and restructuring processes (including workout
tools, IT systems, and governance frameworks) to ensure these are adequate to manage NPLs.



Staff also stressed the need to complement BNB action with other government-supported
initiatives to facilitate an orderly corporate deleveraging process. In this context, guidelines for
voluntary out-of-court debt workouts should be considered, along with measures to address
judicial bottlenecks to timely and predictable insolvency proceedings. Staff also noted how
ongoing work under the Vienna Initiative to foster an effective framework for NPL management
in central and south-eastern Europe could provide the Bulgarian authorities with a useful
platform to make advances in some of these areas.

16.
The mission also sought an update regarding the authorities’ views on close
cooperation under the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) prior to euro adoption. As recently
discussed in the context of the NMS Policy forum, while the decision would need to take into
account a range of considerations as well as the evolving financial architecture of the EA/EU, working
toward SSM participation could generate reform momentum and act as a credibility anchor.9
Nonetheless, staff stressed that these efforts should not detract from prompt follow-through on the
actions highlighted above, and indeed that such actions could be seen as integral to preparations for
SSM participation.
Authorities’ views
17.
The authorities stressed their continued commitment to safeguarding financial
stability. The BNB noted how the liquidity measures that followed the KTB closure had successfully
supported depositors’ confidence and maintained system-wide stability. They pointed to work
9

BULGARIA

underway to rebuild confidence in financial sector oversight, including intensified on-site inspections,
the external BCP assessment, BRRD implementation, and the forthcoming system-wide AQR. They
recognized the importance of the appointment of the new head of supervision to reinforce these
efforts and stressed the need for reforms that would reinforce regulatory independence. They saw
current efforts to promote a gradual reduction in NPLs as having had some success, but also
indicated openness to considering a more systematic approach. The authorities are also currently
assessing the best means to recapitalize the BDIF and to ensure readiness for the planned AQR,
including through appropriate contingency plans in case recapitalization needs materialize. They also
recognized the importance of the timely confirmation of a new BNB governor.
18.
While no timeframe has been announced, the authorities reconfirmed their
commitment to both Euro adoption and participation in the SSM. With nominal triggers for
Euro adoption within reach, they emphasized that movement toward Euro adoption will depend on
greater progress in addressing structural rigidities to increase economic flexibility and accelerate
income convergence. At the same time, they agreed that preparation for SSM could serve as a useful

B. Restoring Fiscal Discipline and Rebuilding Buffers
While partly reflecting deflation-related pressures, the deficit expanded substantially in 2014, breaching
fiscal rules. Ambitious adjustment efforts—beyond those already planned— should be considered to
support policy credibility, strengthen buffers and reduce medium-term risks.
Background
19.
The fiscal deficit rose to 3.7 percent of GDP,
twice the original budget target (cash basis). While
some overshooting was to be expected given
extraordinary deflationary pressures, the deficit
increase also reflects a failure to adequately contain
expenditure once it became clear that optimistic
revenue projections would not materialize:

Revenues. Large projected increases in tax
collection (based on optimistic assumptions for
price levels and efficiency gains, as highlighted in
the 2013 Article IV Staff Report) were not realized,
with grants also lower than projected.

Expenditures. Expenditures were not adjusted to reflect revenue underperformance, while

EU-funded investments improved, but reimbursements were temporarily interrupted due to
concerns related to procurement procedures and control systems.

21.
For 2015, the government’s budget
targets a 3 percent of GDP headline deficit
(cash basis), again above the national rule. This compares to a target of 1.5 percent of GDP in the
2014 Convergence Program.11 The budget is underpinned by conservative revenue assumptions and
entails a reduction in the structural deficit on a cash basis by about 0.8 percent of potential GDP
versus 2014 (with this adjustment likely to be substantially smaller on accrual basis). Adjustment is
driven mainly by reduction in compensation, health-related transfers, and contingency funds. Further
reductions of the headline deficit by 0.5 percent of GDP in each of 2016 and 2017 are programmed.
Staff’s views
22.
The government’s fiscal strategy recognizes the need to reduce deficits following last
year’s slippage, but faster consolidation should be considered. While debt remains relatively low,
the recent jump in debt levels is not expected to be corrected under the authorities’ baseline
scenario. Moreover, medium-term debt dynamics are sensitive to macro-financial shocks and the
materialization of contingent liabilities, including from the banking sector and state-owned companies
(Appendix III). Given low fiscal multipliers12 and substantial scope for efficiency gains, particularly in
10

While final data is not yet available, the accrual-base deficit is estimated by the government to be significantly
lower based on timing issues related mainly to EU funds and tax-related flows. As a result, the deficit is estimated by
the government to be within Maastricht limits. The 2014 first fiscal notification will be published from Eurostat in late
April.
11

The 2015 Convergence Program is expected to be published by end-April, 2015.

2015. This year’s 3 percent deficit target is
achievable. However, with downside risks
related to deflation and ambitious wage
and health spending targets, expenditure
restraint will again be critical. In the event
these risks materialize, the authorities should
seek savings in current spending—given
scope for efficiency gains—and prioritize
high-quality investment projects. Moreover,
any revenue over-performance should be
saved.

1/ Assuming an annual deficit reduction by 0.75% of GDP for 2016-19 to reach
a balanced budget by 2019, and a balanced budget continues in 2020.

Medium-term fiscal path. Targeting a
structural balance by 2019—through an average adjustment of 0.75 percent of GDP per year—
would allow the government to improve debt dynamics and build up a liquidity buffer in good
times, creating space to cope with contingent risks and allowing automatic stabilizers to work
fully in the event of a modest negative shock.

23.
Concrete plans are needed to address medium-term fiscal risks. The aging population
and continued emigration will create significant long-term public spending challenges. Measures to
improve the composition and quality of expenditure and reduce contingent risks associated with
state-owned enterprises, particularly related to transport and energy, will also be needed.


Improving the design and sustainability of the pension system. Ensuring public pension
sustainability, including through parametric reforms, remains critical, with concerns exacerbated
by reversal and delays of earlier reforms.13 This will require a hard look at key features of the
system—from retirement age to contributions and indexation formula to the operation of special
and disability regimes. Last-minute provisions in the 2015 budget, allowing optional transfer
from the second mandatory private pillar to the public system, represent a fundamental change
in the design of Bulgaria’s three-pillar pension system.14 Implementing regulations, including
unorthodox provisions for an open-ended option to shift between public and private systems
over time, are expected to be proposed shortly. In this context, sufficient time should be
provided for thorough impact analysis and stakeholder consultations on specific
recommendations to mitigate potential risks to both the public and private systems.

13

These include the change in the benefit formula from CPI indexation to the “golden Swiss rule” and the freezing of
the retirement ages, which took place in 2014.
14

Final recommendations of a working group comprised of relevant ministries, NSSI, parliamentarians, and social
partners are currently under discussion, with a view to draft a new law in time for implementation in January 2016.



Enhancing health system efficiency. With the recent elimination of the National Health
Insurance Fund’s arrears, follow-through on plans to improve its financial strength and the
efficiency of the broader health system will be critical. Measures are needed to strengthen cost
control mechanisms, increase incentives for proper use of outpatient versus inpatient services,
and upgrade IT systems to improve risk management capacity.



Strengthening fiscal risk management. To further reinforce public information regarding fiscal
policy, disclosure regarding budgetary risks should be enhanced. In addition, risk analysis of
contingent liabilities—both explicit and implicit—as well as sustainability analysis of pension and
health systems, could be expanded. The authorities are encouraged to consider a Fiscal
Transparency Evaluation (Appendix V). Redressing delays in the establishment of a fiscal council
with operational independence would also support policy credibility.

Authorities’ views
24.
The authorities intend to pursue continued fiscal consolidation in the coming years. For
2015, the authorities agreed that the 3 percent deficit target was achievable, given the measures
taken on containing wage and health spending.15 They were also encouraged by strong revenue
performance during the first two months of the year, which they emphasized was supported by
enhanced revenue administration efforts. They were, however, cautious about a faster pace of
consolidation given what they see as still fragile growth dynamics. On pension reforms, they
indicated that the reforms would increase flexibility for individuals to select the system best suited to
their needs and risk appetites, and that they were alert to the importance of careful assessment of
design features before their adoption. The authorities broadly agreed on staff’s recommendations to
further enhance the transparency of fiscal indicators and the importance of strengthening the
assessment of fiscal risks related to contingent liabilities as well as pension and health systems.

C. Advancing Structural Reforms
Tackling near-term challenges should not detract from accelerating progress in addressing critical
structural rigidities, including rising costs and productivity drains associated with energy sector
weaknesses.
Background
25.
Bulgaria continues to see only slow income convergence with European Union
counterparts. The country remains the poorest EU member, with income levels less than half the EU
average and relatively high levels of structural unemployment, as well as significant age, gender, and
regional disparities in income.16

15

This includes a planned 10 percent across-the-board cut in personal expenses and enhanced monitoring and
controlling mechanism for health spending.

27.
Problems arising from inefficiencies in the power sector, notably in the national
electricity supplier (NEK), have become acute. The financial results of NEK have deteriorated since
2007. Exacerbated by consecutive reductions in electricity prices, the NEK’s reported debt is now
estimated at around 4 percent of GDP (Box 2). However, cross-sector subsidies make it difficult to
assess fully the financial situation of the energy sector, including contingent fiscal liabilities. With
social pressures high, the burden of an inefficient sector is increasingly falling into the already
stressed corporate sector, while risks to public finances are rising.
Staff’s views
28.
Actions to kick-start the structural reform agenda are needed to arrest skepticism
about the authorities’ commitment to tackling deeply-seated rigidities after several years of
limited progress. Previous IMF advice, which focused on the need to address institutional and
broader structural gaps to set the foundation for stronger growth and job creation, remains valid.
The lack of structural reforms since EU accession has also come into starker relief following last year’s
bank failure, making all the more important early evidence of progress, most especially through
measures to strengthen human capital, address infrastructure gaps, and increase the ease of doing
business. At the same time, while comprehensive solutions will take time, clear momentum needs to
be established now to demonstrate commitment to reduce corruption and cronyism, strengthen the
rule of law, and set the foundation for renewed confidence in critical institutions.17 Active labor
market policies, including further improvements in education and training, remain important to
reduce labor market rigidities. Such progress would also catalyze the investment and productivity

gains essential to unlock Bulgaria’s economic potential, strengthen job creation, and accelerate
income convergence.
29.
Rising costs and productivity drains speak to the urgency of a comprehensive strategy
for energy sector reform as part of a broader structural agenda. Recent amendments to the
energy act can help reduce pressure on the public electricity company and, in turn, other participants
in the market. Specifically, they provide a foundation to strengthen regulatory independence and to
address rigidities in production costs, including by reducing the output share of inefficient power
plants and re-negotiating long-term purchase agreements. Looking forward, the design and
implementation of a comprehensive energy sector strategy can support the gradual establishment of
a transparent and well-functioning electricity market, in line with EC and World Bank
recommendations. 18 As part of this, a well-designed and phased rationalization of electricity prices,
taking advantage of the current low-cost environment, should proceed in parallel with initiatives to
strengthen protections for the poor households. Finally, enhancements to the governance framework
of major energy SOEs and to the operational capacity of the regulator remain critical.
Authorities’ views
30.
The authorities underscored their commitment to advance the structural agenda.
Priority programs are expected to be highlighted in the April update to the National Reform Program
under the EU framework. Regarding the energy sector, they noted that the new regulator will have
increased independence from the government with the appointment of new members by Parliament
(which occurred following the mission). One of the regulator’s early priorities is to review the tariff
structure. The authorities are optimistic that this will significantly improve NEK’s financial condition.
They also agreed on the importance of early progress in reforms to support a more open and
transparent electricity market.

STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
The Bulgarian economy and financial system have shown substantial resilience to last
year’s political and financial turmoil. Despite the challenging environment, modest growth and a
small reduction in unemployment were achieved in 2014. However, deflationary pressures increased.
Strong banking system liquidity prior to the KTB failure, along with the liquidity measures introduced
by the BNB and government in its wake, helped calm depositors, averting system-wide spillovers.
While inflation is expected to turn positive late in the year, growth is expected to moderate in 2015
and to remain below the level needed to accelerate income convergence into the medium term.
32.
Bulgaria’s hard-won policy credibility has come under scrutiny and the risks to the
outlook have increased. Political turbulence and unaddressed governance issues have raised

18

See the 2014 Country Specific Recommendations to Bulgaria by the EC and “Power Sector Rapid Assessment” by
the World Bank.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

BULGARIA

concerns about prospects for needed action to restore strong macro-financial policies and tackle
structural rigidities. High corporate debt and NPLs, if not addressed, could be a drag on future
investment. At the same time risks related to persistent deflationary pressures, weak external
demand, and regional tensions could further weigh on activity, with limited relief from lower
commodity prices. Developments in Greece, particularly related to the financial sector, further
contribute to uncertainty and require continued close monitoring and contingency planning by the
authorities.
33.
A comprehensive policy response is needed to address near-term challenges and
anchor Bulgaria’s medium-term convergence path. Immediate policy steps should focus on
rebuilding fiscal and financial sector buffers against potential shocks and addressing the gaps in
financial sector oversight brought to light by last year’s bank failure. At the same time, tackling
near-term challenges should not detract from accelerating progress in addressing broader structural
rigidities and governance challenges.
34.
Decisive actions to strengthen the banking system and restore confidence in
supervisory activity are critical. The bank failure has exposed serious shortcomings in supervision.
Forceful steps to strengthen supervisory processes and address gaps in the accountability and crisismanagement frameworks, together with an independent AQR of the banking system, are needed to
strengthen confidence. Moreover, the systemic nature of the high private sector debt overhang and
NPL problem in Bulgaria calls for a comprehensive strategy to advance balance sheet repair, reduce
asset-price uncertainty, and promote an orderly deleveraging process.
35.
While planned fiscal consolidation is welcome, a more ambitious path would help
restore credibility, strengthen buffers, and reduce medium-term risks. This year’s 3 percent of
GDP deficit target is achievable, but, with downside risks related to deflation and ambitious wage
and health spending targets, expenditure restraint will be critical. At the same time, any revenue
upside should be saved. Looking ahead, targeting a structural balance by 2019 would support
downward debt dynamics, create space to cope with contingent risks, and allow automatic stabilizers
to work fully in the event of a modest negative shock. Concrete plans are also needed to address
medium-term fiscal risks stemming from the aging population and to mitigate contingent liabilities
arising from state-owned enterprises. In this context, the sustainability of the public pension system
remains a key concern, and risks associated with ongoing reforms to both the first and second pillar
systems need to be carefully assessed. Increased reporting of fiscal risks and the establishment of an
independent fiscal council would also help to support policy credibility.
36.
After several years of limited progress, the authorities need to jump-start the structural
reform agenda. In particular, rising costs and productivity drains speak to the urgency of a
comprehensive strategy for energy sector reform as part of a broader structural agenda. At the same
time, clear momentum is needed to demonstrate commitment to reducing corruption and cronyism,
strengthening the rule of law, and setting the foundation for renewed confidence in critical
institutions. Progress in these areas would also catalyze the investment and productivity gains
essential to unlocking Bulgaria’s economic potential, strengthening job creation, and accelerating
income convergence.
37.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Bulgaria be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

The FRA, on a generally declining trend since

expected to remain at comfortable levels in
2015. Following a decline to BGN 4.7 billion at
end-2013 versus a statutory end-year limit of
BGN 4.5 billion, the FRA increased sharply to
21
BGN 9.2 billion by end-2014. The increase was
due to additional borrowing for bank
resolution-related needs and pre-financing of
large redemptions of a Eurobond in January
2015. Following the €3.1 billion Eurobonds
issuances in March, which will cover the bulk of
maturing external debt this year, the FRA is
expected to remain comfortably above the
minimum for end-2015.

See a fuller examination of the rule of the FRA in the 2012 IMF Country Report.

Box 2. Bulgaria: Electricity Sector Challenges
The electricity sector in Bulgaria faces significant financial challenges. A heavy debt burden and
sustained losses from on-going operations have complicated the ability of the national electricity distributor,
National Electricity Company (NEK), to meet its obligations to suppliers and distributors. In October 2013,
the parent Bulgarian Energy Holding (BEH) issued bonds for EUR 500 million and on-lent the proceeds to
NEK to help address arrears. Nevertheless, NEK continued to fail to meet its obligations in a timely manner.
With three reductions in electricity tariff rates in 2013, NEK’s financial conditions deteriorated rapidly
in 2014. Loss write-offs consumed more than half of its equity in the four quarters since 2013Q3. Short-term
liabilities to suppliers reached BGN 1.7 billion as of September 2014. These liabilities not only put at risk
financial viability for upstream enterprises, including public and private sector generators, renewable energy
producers, and combined heat and power producers (including district heating companies), but also forced
NEK to delay or scale back urgently needed maintenance and investments. As of September 2014, NEK
reported total debt of more than Lev 3.2 billion (4 percent of GDP). In addition, NEK’s high leverage, with a
debt to equity ratio of 174 percent and low liquidity (with its current asset covering only half of its
short-term liabilities), raise further concerns about its financial sustainability. Given state ownership of NEK,
sizable contingent liabilities to public finance could materialize in the event of NEK’s inability to generate
sufficient cash flows to service its debt.

Appendix I. External Sector Assessment
Bulgaria’s current account underwent a sizable adjustment with the collapse in capital inflows following the
global financial crisis. The range of standard indicators and methodologies for external assessment paint a mixed
picture, but Bulgaria does not appear to suffer from major price/cost competitiveness problems at this juncture,
given continued strong export performance. Nonetheless, adjustment in the real effective exchange rate (REER)
since its pre-crisis peak has been modest when compared to peers, and productivity gains will need to strengthen
if Bulgaria is to meet its own convergence objectives in a sustainable manner.
The current account has significantly adjusted following the global financial crisis. Prior to the crisis,
ample and cheap foreign funds helped finance an investment boom, fueling an extraordinarily high current
account deficit. The sharp reduction in capital inflows,
including FDI, following the crisis forced a sharp current

account adjustment, from a deficit of 24.3 percent of

50

GDP in 2007 to a surplus in 2013 and 2014. Sharp import

40

compression, driven by weakened domestic demand and

30

a plunge in investment-related imports, played a
dominant role in the immediate aftermath of the crisis,
while resilient export performance also supported
current account adjustment. The income balance has
improved only modestly, driven by reduced repatriation

Bulgaria’s real exchange rate continued to increase in the post-crisis period when compared to regional
peers. The CPI-based REER in Bulgaria declined by about 4 percent through end-2013 from its pre-crisis peak,
compared to 13 and 9 percent in EU and NMS countries, respectively. The ULC-based REER has increased since
the onset of the global financial crisis (close to 30 percent cumulatively over 2008–13). That said, Bulgaria’s
market share in major export destinations has improved, including relative to its peers, in recent years. This was
likely supported by substantially higher productivity gains in tradable industrial sectors than in non-tradable

service sectors. Nonetheless, while some catch-up in wage rates is expected given that Bulgaria’s average
wage remains the lowest among EU members, continuation of high overall wage increases (well above
productivity growth) will likely become more binding for Bulgaria’s competitiveness in the medium-term,
particularly as non-tradable sectors wage dynamics would be expected to affect the tradable sectors eventually
through labor mobility. At the same time, there is room for Bulgaria to further improve the domestic
value-added of exports (which, while growing, represents a declining share of overall exports) and move up the
quality ladder.2
The estimates based on the EBA-lite methodology suggest sizable undervaluation, but should be
interpreted with caution. Given a large gap (over 7 percent of GDP) between the actual current account and
its calculated norm based on a cross-country panel regression, Bulgaria’s REER is calculated to be undervalued
by about 16 percent. Nevertheless, this result should

be interpreted with caution, because the model does

Appendix II. Reserve Adequacy
Bulgaria’s international reserves remain well within the range suggested by IMF’s ARA composite
metric (see Assessing Reserves Adequacy). The ratio rose from about 120 percent at end-2013 to an
estimated 130 percent as of end-2014. Over recent years, pressures on international reserves as calculated
under the ARA framework have been limited, with fluctuations in short-term debt and broad money
adequately covered by reserve accumulation.

Bulgaria, like most other countries with currency board arrangements (CBAs), holds international
reserves comfortably above its monetary base. The ratio of international reserves to the monetary base,
while declining in recent years, remains above 150 percent as of end-2014. Nevertheless, in view of Bulgaria’s
sizable banking system, a broad-money coverage ratio is also a useful gauge of resilience to financial distress.
Bulgaria’s reserve coverage of broad money, while declining slightly in recent years, improved slightly in 2014,
to nearly 50 percent.

Appendix III. Debt Sustainability
External debt peaked in 2009 and has broadly followed a downward trend since then. The overall decline
in gross external debt from about 110 percent of GDP at end-2009 to around 90 percent of GDP at end-2014
was largely due to private sector deleveraging. More than half of this decline was due to banks, where debt fell
from about 25 percent of GDP at its peak to under 14 percent of GDP at end-2014. Excluding intercompany
lending, which is relatively stable, external debt was about a little over 55 percent of GDP at end-2014, and this
was largely matched by international reserves. Rollover risks related to external exposure in the nonbank
private sector, which did not materialize during the global financial crisis, are contained given moderate
short-term exposure.
Gross external debt is expected to decline further under staff’s baseline projections. External debt is set
to reach under 80 percent of GDP by 2019, primarily due to nominal GDP growth, with relatively little change in
nominal external debt. Under the historical DSA scenario, the denominator effect on the debt-to-GDP ratio is
even stronger because historical growth is higher than projected growth.
External debt dynamics appear broadly resilient to shocks. Shocks to the interest rate, the growth rate, and
the current account deficit would shift the trajectory of external debt relative to GDP upwards. However, under
all the scenarios, the external debt to GDP ratio is projected to eventually resume its downward-sloping path
over the medium term.
Public debt increased significantly in 2014, but remains at manageable levels. In the medium term, while
debt levels remain low, the fiscal adjustment under the baseline scenario is not sufficient to secure debt firmly
on a downward path. Assuming FRA balances remain at the projected 2015 level, there will be virtually no
correction to the increase in debt levels during the projection period. Moreover, medium-term debt dynamics
are sensitive to macro-financial shocks and the materialization of contingent liabilities. In particular, a
combined macro-fiscal shock would bring the debt ratio above 40 percent by 2017. Risks from intensified
deflationary pressures and unaccounted contingent liabilities, e.g., from SOEs and the banking sector, could
also result in higher outcomes, as could spending pressures related to the aging population, given recent
reversals in pension reforms and additional system changes currently under discussion, as well as inefficiencies
in the health sector. Recent successful Eurobond issuance has substantially reduced the near-term refinancing
risk while moderate refinancing needs are projected for the next five years. Nonetheless, addressing underlying
fiscal vulnerabilities is important to preserve market access at favorable rates.

Appendix IV. Corporate Commercial Bank: Bank Failure and
Resolution
Background. As of end-2013, Corporate Commercial Bank AD (KTB) was the fourth largest bank in Bulgaria in
terms of assets, third in terms of net profits, and first in terms of deposit growth. Since late 2011, the bank had
conducted an aggressive funding strategy, with interest rates on deposits well above those of other banks in
the system, as it rapidly expanded its market share. The bank’s commercial portfolio (concentrated in the
corporate sector) and deposit base included sizable exposures to SOEs, notably in electricity and other network
industries. As presented in its 2013 consolidated financial statement, KTB’s capital adequacy ratio stood at
12.6 percent (compared to the BNB minimum requirement of 12 percent and a system average of 16.9 percent)
as of end-December 2013. Reported NPL ratios, at 0.2 percent, were significantly below the system average of
16.9 percent. In June 2014, KTB acquired from Credit Agricole its Bulgarian subsidiary, later renamed
Commercial Bank Victoria EAD (CBV).
Distress triggers and spillovers. On June 20, 2014, KTB was placed under conservatorship by the BNB’s
Governing Council, following a massive deposit run. Within days, the bank had lost BGN 1.2 billion or about
20 percent of its total deposits, following media speculation of a concerted attack by powerful interests and
rising concerns about the bank’s solvency position (including allegations of fraud and connected lending). On
June 22, KTB’s subsidiary, CBV was also placed under special supervision by BNB. As a result of BNB
intervention, all payments to customers by the two banks were suspended (including access to guaranteed
deposits). By Friday June 27, pressures had started to spread to the rest of the banking system—with First
Investment Bank (FIB), the largest domestic bank, losing about 10 percent of its deposits and being forced to
close in the afternoon. These events arose in the context of substantial domestic uncertainty, following the
announced resignation of the government earlier in the month.

Immediate policy response. To weather the deposit run and avoid broader spillovers, on Sunday June 29, the
President announced a broad-based consensus (supported by the government, opposition, and BNB) on a
package of measures to preserve stability in the financial system. This included a liquidity assistance scheme (of up to
BGN 3.3 billion or 4 percent of GDP), providing 5-month state deposits at market conditions to solvent Bulgarian

credit institutions in need of liquidity support. The terms of the scheme were set in line with EU state aid rules,
as approved by the EC. The package was effective in calming depositors and allowed FIB and other banks to
re-open on Monday June 30 with no need for deposit restrictions and only limited additional withdrawals. In
particular, under the liquidity assistance scheme, FIB was granted a state deposit of BGN 1.2 billion. On
November 28, FIB repaid BGN 0.3 billion of the state deposit while the remaining BGN 0.9 billion was extended,
in line with EU state aid rules, by a maximum of 18 months. FIB presented a restructuring plan to the EC on
November 12, including a set of commitments to restore liquidity as well as to improve its corporate
governance structure and risk management policies.
KTB audit results. On June 25, upon BNB’s request, a review of KTB bank group’s assets and liabilities was
initiated by independent external auditors. However, on July 11, the preliminary audit results pointed to
significant shortcomings in the availability of documentation on KTB’s financial position and loan portfolio,
requiring a more comprehensive audit of KTB assets. This delayed the initially planned re-opening of the bank
by July 21. Moreover, while the bank’s financial situation was being reviewed and pending BNB’s decision on
KTB’s license revocation, all deposits remained frozen, with no authorized payments of protected depositors by
the Deposit Insurance Fund (BDIF).2 The audit results were published on October 22 and identified impairment
deviations for about BGN 4.22 billion, of which BGN 3.4 billion (64 percent of KTB total loan portfolio) in loans
extended to newly created investment companies without staff and other operational activity and where the
necessary information for credit risk assessment was missing. After the recognition of the impairment
deviations identified by the auditors, KTB showed a negative capital (of about BGN 3.75 billion).
Resolution strategy.



KTB. On November 6, BNB formally revoked KTB’s banking license based on the finding of negative capital.
Lacking an existing legal framework for the restructuring of credit institutions (and pending
implementation of the EU Directive on Bank Recovery and Resolution), liquidation represented the only
available option for the resolution of KTB under existing legislation.3 Following the license revocation, BNB
requested that the district court start the bank insolvency proceedings, in line with the Bulgarian law on
bank bankruptcy. KTB’s shareholders appealed against the BNB decision, which halted the insolvency
proceedings. In the meantime, the revocation of the license triggered the conditions for the payout by the
BDIF of guaranteed deposits as of December 4 (for up to up to BGN 196,000, i.e. EUR 100,000, per
depositor), through selected servicing banks. With BGN 1.8 billion available in the BDIF, the funding gap to
cover all protected depositors was estimated by the BDIF at approximately BGN 1.7 billion at end-October.
To cover this gap, on December 3, the government approved a loan (provided for through amendments to
the 2014 budget) to the BDIF of up to BGN 2 billion with a maturity of up to 5.5 years, at a fixed interest
rate of 2.95 percent. The majority of the KTB guaranteed depositors’ payments were carried out as deposits

1

The package also included steps to reinforce supervision, including a call for a peer review of BNB supervision by the
EBA and initiation of steps to join the Single Supervisory Mechanism.
2
While the decision was in line with the existing Bulgarian law (which provided for the BDIF to pay out protected
deposits only when the BNB revoked a bank’s license), it resulted in conflict with Directive 94/19/EC. See the related
EBA recommendation to the BNB and BDIF, EBA/REC/2014/02, and subsequent exchanges.
3
Bulgaria’s legal framework did not give the authorities adequate resolution tools. A plan for the restructuring of KTB
and CBV was initially presented by the BNB but the proposed legislative changes to implement the plan did not find
the necessary political support.

in other banks in the system. As a result, private sector deposit growth has remained positive for the
system as a whole, at 1.5 percent y-o-y in December.



CBV. The audit results on July 11 indicated that CBV’s financial indicators were within the regulatory
requirements, although the bank did not have sufficient liquid funds to meet its obligations. However,
given KTB group’s bankruptcy, CBV could not be granted state aid. Therefore, the sale of separate parts of
its loan portfolio represented the only available option to secure the necessary liquidity. The selected bids
by banks, as part of the tender procedure, closed on November 14, provided additional liquid funds to
CBV for the full repayment of the bank’s deposit obligations (both guaranteed and non-guaranteed). As a
result, BNB authorized the bank to resume its banking activity and restart servicing its depositors without
restrictions on December 12. The special supervision period expired on December 23.

Appendix V. Transparency of Fiscal Risks
Fiscal risks cause fiscal outcomes to differ from forecasts. Such risks include not only uncertainty about the
evolution of fiscally-important macroeconomic variables (e.g., growth and inflation), but also specific sources
(e.g., such as calls on government guarantees, tax disputes and other litigation, and changes in the values of the
government’s assets and liabilities). A government’s ability to cope with fiscal risks depends on the quality of
the information on risks, the power to limit its exposure to those risks that can be mitigated, and its capacity to
absorb the fiscal consequences of those risks that cannot be mitigated (IMF Manual on Fiscal Transparency).
A first step towards strengthening the management of fiscal risks is enhancing disclosure. Making fiscal
information available to the public in a timely manner and free of charge is a defining characteristic of fiscal
transparency. The information should be also enhanced through analyzing risks to the public finances.
Bulgaria makes available basic information on broad fiscal risk indicators, but weaknesses remain in the
areas where fiscal risks appear large, A preliminary analysis suggests scope to enhance disclosure and risk
assessment in of the following areas:



Some indicators are published, but (i) not frequently enough to reflect the rapidly changing environment
(e.g., actuarial assessment of NSSI; government debt strategy); or (ii) not in a form that allows to easily
conduct risk assessments (e.g., aggregated data on public corporations; litigations to the government).



Risk analysis is conducted by the government in some areas, but the results are not regularly published:
e.g., financial-sector stress tests; and environmental costs.



In many areas, risk analysis is not conducted by the government: e.g., health sector (i.e., actuarial
assessment of NHIF); contingent liabilities (e.g., the probability that guarantees are called).

IMF-WORLD BANK RELATIONS
A. Partnership in Bulgaria’s Development Strategy
1.
The World Bank has been leading the policy dialogue in structural and institutional
reforms aimed at Bulgaria’s successful EU integration and convergence. On May 17, 2011 the
Board of Directors discussed the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) of the Bank which outlined the
roadmap for the Bank’s country support for the period 2011–13. The CPS maintains a strong focus
on Bulgaria making the most of its EU membership. It aims to partner with Bulgaria in strengthening
national institutions and capacity to meet EU targets and in accelerating the absorption of EU grant
funds. The objective of the CPS is to support Bulgaria in strengthening institutions and policies to
achieve smart, sustainable, and inclusive growth. The CPS proposes a program dominated by
knowledge and advisory services complemented by a modest lending program. World Bank
knowledge and advisory services focus on policy reforms, sector strategies and strengthening
institutional capacity for increased EU funds absorption. The Bank continues to undertake
substantial knowledge and advisory services on policy reforms in select sectors and themes of
Bulgaria’s National Reform Program 2011–2015 such as innovation, education, business regulation,
transport, water, climate change, and social inclusion.

B. IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
2.
The Fund team led by Ms. Shannon (mission chief) meets regularly with the World
Bank Bulgaria team led by Mr. Antony Thompson (Country Manager for Bulgaria, the Czech
Republic and Slovakia), to discuss macro-critical structural reforms and to coordinate the two
teams’ work. The most recent meeting took place in March 2015.
3.
Bulgaria’s main macroeconomic challenges are to maintain stability and enhance
growth in a difficult external environment. Fiscal discipline and growth enhancing public
spending are key to supporting the currency board arrangement and improving growth prospects.
Prudent regulation and adequate capital buffers will help maintain financial system stability in a
changing supervisory framework in Europe, while improvements in the business climate will facilitate
more sustainable tradable-based growth.
4.
Based on this shared assessment, the teams identified seven structural reform areas as
macro critical in view of their central role in achieving fiscal consolidation and enhancing growth.


4

Bank and non-bank financial institution (NBFI) regulation and supervision. Strengthening
the governance of all institutions responsible for financial sector stability is critical to restore
confidence, attract needed private investment, and limit the need for government support.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BULGARIA



EU funds absorption. Increased absorption of EU funds through improvements of
administrative capacity and upgrading planning, execution, and monitoring systems will play a
vital role in supporting growth and investment.



Healthcare reform. Mispricing and other distorted incentives have created financing pressures
for the public health insurance fund, calling for a comprehensive reform focusing on efficiency
and quality of the system—including through rationalizing in-patient care.



Education reform. Building on past achievement, education reforms should focus on improving
results. The areas of reform include measures to enhance the quality of student learning and to
improve access to education.



Pension reform. Reforms to improve the financial performance and equity of the pension
system will be key to contain rising fiscal costs associated with aging and declining population.



Improving the environment for growth. Anchoring wage growth in productivity growth and
strengthening the business environment by improving the insolvency framework and reducing
the regulatory costs for doing business are called for. Furthermore, reforms in the judicial system
and anti-corruption and anti-monopoly regimes are necessary to underpin higher potential
growth.



Basic infrastructure and energy. Upgrading basic infrastructure and strengthening energy
governance, security of supply, and energy efficiency are a high priority to improve
competitiveness of the economy.

5.
The teams agreed that the Bank and the Fund share responsibility on financial sector
issues, revenue administration, and pension reforms, while the Bank will lead EU funds
absorption, basic infrastructure, business environment, health and education reforms, and
social inclusion. Both teams will keep the other apprised of upcoming missions and assessments.
World Bank country economists participated in the Article IV Consultations in September 2012,
November 2013, and March 2015.

C. The World Bank Group Strategy and Lending Operations
6.
The Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Bulgaria, discussed by the Bank’s
Board on May 17, 2011, is anchored in Bulgaria’s National Reform Program to implement the
Europe 2020 Strategy and focused on three main pillars: (i) policy reforms for the National Reform
Program to implement Europe 2020 Strategy, (ii) strategies and institutions to accelerate EU funds
absorption, and (iii) complementing EU financing.1
7.
The active Bank portfolio in Bulgaria as of March 2015 consists of 2 operations at the
original loan amount of US$177.7 million equivalent. The World Bank’s lending program in
Bulgaria to date comprises 46 IBRD operations with a total original commitment of US$3,003 million
equivalent, consisting of 15 adjustment loans (US$1,725.8 million), 24 investment projects
(US$1,123 million), one debt reduction loan (US$125 million), four Bank-managed Global
Environmental Fund (GEF) grants, and two Bank-managed Prototype Carbon Fund (PCF) operations.
Of these 46 operations, 44 have been completed (of which 14 have been fully or partially cancelled
during implementation), and 2 operations are currently under implementation (Table 1).
8.
Economic and Sector Work. The World Bank country diagnostic work completed over the
last two years focuses on assessing the economic and fiscal impact of an aging population;
productivity growth; unfair trading practices; governance, quality assurance and financing of early
childhood development, pre-university and higher education, and quality of teachers; institutional
and strategic framework for workforce development; health sector financing; and Roma inclusion.
Recently completed analytical work includes: Mitigating the Economic Impact of an Aging
Population, Productivity Growth (forthcoming), Addressing Unfair Trading Practices Early Childhood
Development Assessment, Strengthening Higher Education, Teachers Assessment, Workforce
Development Assessment, Health Sector Diagnosis, and Gender Dimensions of Roman Inclusion. Six
reimbursable advisory service (RAS) agreements for provision of World Bank advisory services have
been signed since 2012 focusing on water supply and sanitation strategy and regulation, innovation
(completed), roads, health financing, and agriculture and hydro melioration.
9.
As of March 2015, the IFC had 38 projects (completed and ongoing) in Bulgaria with
total commitments of over US$915 million. The single biggest investment of IFC in the country is
in the field of renewable energy in the form of a loan for the construction of the largest wind park in
Bulgaria. IFC is also involved in the development of the Galata gas field near the Black sea cost. In
line with the IFC’s strategic goals for Bulgaria, IFC has supported a company investing in agricultural
land and promoting land consolidation. In the financial sector, IFC is supporting two specialized SME
banks; it established Bulgaria’s first micro-lending bank and has invested in a venture fund, which is
also targeting the SME sector. In other industries, IFC had contributed to key manufacturing
projects—it has supported the modernization and expansion of an electronics producer, a large

steel mill, and two glass processing plants. Some IFC projects entail an important environmental
component. One of the manufacturing plants, for example, is purchasing equipment which would
reduce its GHG emissions and the electronics producing company is making sensors for cars that
monitor the emission of polluting gases and improve fuel efficiency.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate for surveillance purposes. Bulgaria participates in the SDDS since 2003.
Real Sector
1.
The National Statistical Institute (NSI) is responsible for compiling national accounts,
based on a system consistent with the System of National Accounts 2008 (SNA 2008) and the
European System of Accounts 2010. GDP data by activity and expenditure categories are
compiled and reconciled within an annual supply and use framework. Government output and final
consumption are estimated on an accrual basis. Published national accounts include current and
capital accounts for the five main domestic sectors (general government and its sub-sectors,
financial corporations, non-financial corporations, nonprofit institutions serving households, and
households). The NSI publishes financial accounts and balance sheets by institutional sectors and
sub-sectors on an annual basis.
2.
The NSI has compiled estimates of quarterly GDP by the production and expenditure
approaches in current and constant prices since 1995. The preliminary flash estimates of GDP
and its components by production and expenditure side are produced and disseminated 42–44 days
after the reference period, although persistent inconsistencies in the data have limited their usage.
The quarterly updates are disseminated 65 days after the end of the reference quarter with final
figures disseminated after 3 quarters. The annual data are disseminated about 5 quarters after the
end of the reference year. The estimates at constant prices, which follow international standards, use
chain-linked indices. Problems remain in the coverage of private sector activities as well as regarding
constant price estimates of capital formation and external trade, although progress has been made
in the development of export and import deflators. Recent IMF TA advised on improving the
seasonal adjustment procedure of quarterly GDP and volume measures of taxes on products.

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BULGARIA

3.
Regarding price data, the NSI produces a domestic consumer price index (CPI), a
harmonized consumer price index (HICP) according to Eurostat methods, and a producer
price index (PPI). All are updated monthly. The CPI series begins in 1995, the PPI in 2000 and the
HICP in 2005 (for earlier years it is set equal to the CPI). The coverage of the consumer price indices
was extended, although they still exclude some important sectors, mainly owner-occupied housing
and health and life insurance. Since 2004, financial services are included. Work has started on
inclusion of owner-occupied housing in the HICP under a Eurostat project. The geographical
coverage of the index is restricted to 27 urban areas that account for an estimated 65 percent of
sales.
4.
The flow of customs data has improved significantly in recent years and a new system
for processing customs records is near completion. The development of export and import unit
value indices is progressing smoothly and additional support is expected from Eurostat in this area.
The current indices are used as deflators for the import and export components of the national
accounts. Each month the Foreign Trade Statistics Department of the NSI is in contact with the BNB
to review data issues and ensure consistency between the NSI export and import data and the
balance of payments data.
5.
The national accounts data on employment and hours worked are compiled by the NSI
based on a Labor Force Survey and Enterprises’ survey on employment—“Quarterly survey on
employees, hours worked, wages and salaries, and other expenditures paid by the employers” and
“Annual enterprises survey on employment, wages and salaries, and other labor cost” are adjusted
according to the ESA95 methodology. The NSI current monthly and quarterly estimates are based
on the results from the quarterly sample survey of establishments – QLCS. The QLCS sample
includes 13000 private sector enterprises out of approximately 223000. The public sector enterprises
are covered exhaustively except for the schools and kindergartens for which from 2008 a sample is
drown as well. The NSI household labor force survey is an alternative source of data, but the
methodological discrepancies between household and establishment survey need to be taken into
account (especially regarding agricultural employment). Since the beginning of 2003 a quarterly
Labour force survey, providing average quarterly results, is implemented.
6.
The NSI also compiles and publishes quarterly wage data for various economic sectors.
The main shortcomings include: (i) under-reporting of private sector wages; and (ii) reporting of
average gross earnings only and not wages by occupation. Since 2002, a survey on earnings
(Structure of Earnings Survey – SES) is conducted every four years providing information about
average monthly and hourly earnings by economic activity, occupation, gender and education. The
household budget survey provides an alternative source of data for private sector wages.
7.
A Population Census was conducted in early 2011 and is a source for redesigning the
household surveys conducted by the NSI, particularly the household budget survey and the labor
force survey.

Government Finance
8.
In recent years, following the recommendations of a combined STA/FAD mission and
within the framework of EU fiscal reporting , the authorities have made significant progress
on implementing accrual accounting for government, budgetary and statistical systems.
Consolidated data on a cash basis, covering general and central government operations, were
routinely reported for publication in the GFS Yearbook/Annual CD-ROM and in IFS. In addition,
quarterly accrual GFS data for the whole general government are reported for publication in IFS,
through Eurostat. The major part of the GFS data is compiled by NSI and the transmissions to
Eurostat are carried out by NSI. Since September 2008, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) prepares and
submits the SDDS indicators for the central government finances in the IMF’s GFSM 2001 format.
The same indicators are published on the MOF’s website on a monthly and quarterly basis. As of
2014, the Bulgarian statistical authorities (NSI, BNB and MoF) have agreed to use the provided
option by Eurostat for IMF data transmission. In this way GFS data becomes consistent with ESA/EDP
data not only by adding accrual data, but also in terms of scope, including all units of GG sector in
accordance with ESA rules. The Bulgarian National Statistical Institute as the institution responsible
for compiling GFS tables under ESA’2010 has confirmed to Eurostat to use data from ESA tables 6
and 7 for reporting the annual GFS to IMF.
9.
The Ministry of Finance prepares data on the execution of the consolidated
government budget on a monthly basis, following the national presentation. These data are
not according to GFS standards. Aggregate data on revenue, expenditure, balance of the general
government and composition of financing (in national formats) are published in the monthly bulletin
and posted on the MOF’s website, in addition to the GFSM 2001 data. Progress has been made in
presenting data on a disaggregated basis, including expenditure by functional classification. In
addition, a full economic classification of expenditure is now available, and the authorities have
provided such data on an annual basis back to 1998.
Money and Banking Statistics
10.
The BNB reports monetary data for publication in IFS based on the ECB framework for the
collection and compilation of monetary data.
Balance of Payments
11.
Bulgaria provides quarterly balance of payments (BOP) statistics for dissemination in
IFS on a timely basis. Balance of payments and international investment position (IIP) statistics are
compiled according to the Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5). The first transmission
of International Investment Position (IIP) data on the basis of the Balance of Payments and
International Investment Position Manual, 6th edition (BPM6) will take place in March 2015. Since
joining the EU in January 2007, the trade data with EU countries are being collected following the

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BULGARIA

INTRASTAT system. Data for imports and exports of goods with non-EU member states are based on
SAD (Single Administrative Document) collected by Customs Agency while the movement of goods
within the EU is based on Intrastat declarations collected by the National Revenue Agency. The Data
Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity is disseminated monthly and
quarterly external debt data are reported to the World Bank for redissemination in the Quarterly
External Debt Statistics (QEDS) database.
Financial Soundness Indicators
12.
Bulgaria participates in the financial soundness indicators (FSIs) project. Annual data are
posted on the FSI website for the period 2005 – 2013.
Data Standards and Quality
13.
Bulgaria is subject to the statistical requirements and reporting standards of Eurostat
and the European Central Bank (ECB). Bulgaria subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS) since 2003, and the relevant metadata have been posted on the Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board. A data ROSC has been published in December 2003. The latest (20132)
annual observation report for Bulgaria is posted on the Fund’s website

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Bulgaria
On May 4, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Bulgaria.1
Over the last year, Bulgaria’s hard-won macroeconomic and financial stability has been tested by
the failure of a large bank and deterioration in the fiscal balance. Nonetheless, modest growth
was achieved in 2014 and is expected to continue in 2015, albeit at a lower rate. Consumer prices
declined by an average 1.6 percent in 2014, among the sharpest contractions in the EU, but are
projected to turn positive late in the year.
The banking system has shown substantial resilience to the damage to confidence resulting from
the bank failure. Strong system liquidity and the liquidity support scheme introduced by the BNB
and government helped avert system-wide spillovers. However, decisive actions are needed to
address weaknesses exposed by the bank failure, restore supervisory credibility, and strengthen
crisis management tools. While reported banking system capital buffers remain adequate in
aggregate, balance-sheet repair is advancing only slowly.
The fiscal deficit rose to 3.7 percent of GDP, twice the original target. The budget targets a
3 percent of GDP deficit in 2015, and a further 0.5 percentage point reduction per year in coming
years. Measures to improve the composition and quality of expenditure and mitigate contingent
liabilities arising from state-owned enterprises remain key. At the same time, an aging
population and emigration represent significant long-term public spending challenges.
Income convergence with EU counterparts is projected to remain slow with significant age,
gender, and regional disparities in income. Decisive action to address long-standing concerns
related to corruption remains key. The government has begun to take steps to address the
increasingly acute problems arising from inefficiencies in the power sector.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted that Bulgaria has shown resilience to political and financial sector
turbulence in the past year, with modest growth and a small reduction in unemployment being
achieved notwithstanding strong deflationary pressures. While inflation is projected to turn
positive later this year, growth is expected to moderate further in 2015 and remain below levels
needed to accelerate income convergence with EU partners. At the same time, risks to the
outlook have increased from policy uncertainty and external developments. Directors called for a
comprehensive policy response to address risks and restart reform momentum.
Directors urged decisive actions to address important gaps in financial sector oversight and the
crisis-management framework in light of the failure of the large domestic bank (KTB). They
encouraged prompt implementation of planned reforms to the resolution framework and early
recapitalization of the deposit insurance fund. They also welcomed plans to initiate an asset
quality review later this year. Directors highlighted the importance of a comprehensive strategy
to address the high private sector debt overhang and nonperforming loans to help advance
balance sheet repair, reduce asset-price uncertainty, and promote orderly deleveraging. They also
underscored the need for ongoing monitoring and contingency planning related to developments
in Greece.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ plans to set the budget on a consolidation path following
substantial fiscal slippage in 2014. Emphasizing the importance of rebuilding fiscal buffers and
restoring policy credibility, particularly under the currency board arrangement, Directors agreed
that the authorities should consider more ambitious medium-term consolidation. At the same
time, a number of Directors noted the importance—and the challenge—of ensuring that such
consolidation does not weaken domestic demand. Containing spending while enhancing its
efficiency and prioritizing high-quality public investment, as well as saving revenue
over-performance, will be important. Directors also underscored the need for concrete plans to
address medium-term fiscal risks stemming from population aging and contingent liabilities from
state-owned enterprises (SOEs). They encouraged the authorities to improve the design and
sustainability of the pension system and enhance the efficiency of SOEs.
Directors welcomed recent energy sector reforms as important first steps in addressing rising
costs and inefficiencies in the sector. They called for broader structural reforms to catalyze
investment and productivity gains essential to unlocking Bulgaria’s economic potential,
strengthening job creation, and accelerating income convergence. They emphasized the
importance of concrete progress in reducing corruption and strengthening the rule of law in

renewing confidence in critical institutions. They also pointed to the need to address gaps in
health, education, infrastructure, and energy markets.

Statement by Menno Snel, Executive Director for Bulgaria and
Tsvetan Manchev, Advisor to Executive Director
May 4, 2015
The Bulgarian authorities highly appreciate the constructive policy dialogue with the mission
during the 2015 Article IV consultation, and thank staff for their appraisal. They also
welcome the staff analyses in the Selected Issues paper. The authorities remain committed to
prudent macroeconomic policies which promote sustainable growth, and broadly share the
staff’s policy advice as presented in the staff report.
The Currency Board Arrangement (CBA) continues to be the cornerstone for domestic
policymaking amid the uncertainty. Along with this, the authorities use every window of
opportunity to reinforce macroeconomic stability. The Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) took
decisive actions to increase bank liquidity and support depositor confidence following the
closure of the ailing Corporate Commercial Bank (KTB). In March 2015, Bulgaria
successfully issued a €3.1 billion Eurobond which not only covers the 2015 external
financing needs, but serves as an additional buffer. In April 2015, a new Law on the Fiscal
Council was adopted, which establishes the Fiscal Council to serve as an independent
consultative body to the Bulgarian Parliament.
Bulgaria has experienced significant political instability and financial distress since the last
Article IV consultation. The minority coalition government elected last fall faces a difficult
domestic and external environment. This situation further limits the policy options to
preserve macroeconomic and financial stability, rebuild buffers against shocks, and advance
with the already delayed structural reforms. With the local elections planned for later this
year, every aspect of government activity is placed under deep scrutiny, which could make
immediate policy steps even more difficult. A new impetus for structural reforms could only
come from improving public confidence in the reform process and further strengthening of
the EU fund’s utilization.
The new government keeps focusing on social issues, while its near-term plan includes three
main pillars: (1) gradual fiscal consolidation and enhanced revenue administration;
(2) rebuilding confidence in the financial sector through system-wide legal amendments and
institutional enhancements; and (3) structural reforms.
Recent Macroeconomic Developments
The authorities generally share staff’s view on the macroeconomic developments and
outlook. Since the last Article IV consultation, net export has not contributed positively to
economic growth. The recently released 2015 government Spring Forecast has taken into
account the published reporting data for 2014, the most recent developments in the external
environment, and the more favorable expectations for the domestic economy from the
beginning of 2015. The business climate and employment in the main sectors of the economy
have slightly improved which has led to an upward revision of 2015 growth by
0.6 percentage points, to 1.4 percent. Driven by domestic demand, in the period 2016–18,
growth is expected to gradually speed up and reach 2.3 percent, but it will remain insufficient

2
for income convergence with the European levels.
The subdued growth in 2015 reflects still cautious recovery of the private sector demand and
lower contribution of the public sector. Some improvement in the external environment,
expressed in slightly higher growth of the European and world economies, will lead to an
increase in the real export of goods and services by 2.8 percent y-o-y, but the contribution of
net export to growth will remain negative. The 2015 current account balance, however, will
be slightly positive.
The authorities welcome staff’s analysis on inflation determinants. They are fully aware that
sustained deflation represents an important risk for the economic recovery and public
finances given the limitations of the current fiscal stance and lack of independent monetary
policy in a small open economy. Against this background, the authorities are committed to
exercise tight control over the nominal wages in the public sector in the short term and keep
closer alignment of utility tariffs with the cost structure. In line with staff’s advice, these
measures will be accompanied by enhanced protection of the poor and proactive management
of the inflationary expectations to avoid a deflationary spiral.
Fiscal Sustainability
After the parliamentary elections in October 2014, the new parliamentary majority has
clearly recognized the need to reduce budget deficits following earlier slippages. However,
striking the right balance between the pace of fiscal consolidation and support for economic
growth remains a daunting task for the authorities. The new minority government has
consolidated around the strategy for gradual fiscal consolidation. Within the recently revised
medium-term budgetary framework, the government envisages a nominal reduction of the
fiscal deficit on cash basis by 0.5 percent per year until 2018. Respectively, the return to a
structurally balanced budget by 2019 would allow the automatic stabilizers to work while the
government builds up liquidity buffers in good times and contains debt accumulation.
The 2015 budget fully demonstrates the fiscal responsibility of the new government as well
as its commitment to restore confidence in the management of the public finances. The
budget envisages a deficit of 3 percent of GDP on cash basis and a reduction in the structural
deficit by approximately 0.5 percent, mainly through improving the efficiency of spending.
In addition, the budget lays down taut and ambitious reforms in the public finance
management, while restraining administrative and operational expenditures. In the first
quarter of 2015, the revenue administration has been strengthened, resulting in higher
revenues compared with last year. The authorities are also committed to save much of the
revenue overperformance.
The recently adopted Law on Fiscal Council stipulates that the members will be accountable
to the Parliament, which aims to increase transparency of fiscal indicators and policies. The
authorities are fully committed to immediately implement the law in order to get better
understanding of fiscal risks and their attribution.

3
The Banking System
The authorities are fully aware that it is of utmost importance to restore confidence and
credibility in the financial system. Since the KTB failure, they have implemented policy
measures at various levels to stabilize the banking sector. First and foremost, the goal to
avoid a spillover effect has been successfully achieved through the immediate adoption of a
state liquidity support framework for the banking sector, in compliance with the EU state aid
rules, and smooth repayment of the insured deposits in KTB. Second, the BNB has enhanced
oversight over the individual bank liquidity management, and has strengthened liquidity
requirements. Third, the CRD IV has been fully implemented to banks, additional capital
buffers have been created, and the NPLs are continuously reported in a very conservative
manner. In addition to the good provisioning, the banks have strengthened their internal
strategies to handle the NPLs with encouraging preliminary results. These measures have
supported depositors’ confidence and assured system-wide stability.
Going forward, the authorities agree with staff that a clear strategy and additional measures
will be needed to restore credibility in the financial system. In August 2014 the authorities
requested a full FSAP. Since then, they have coordinated with the IMF on the next steps. An
assessment of compliance with the Basle Core Principles for effective banking supervision
was recently conducted by the IMF/WB team and the report will be published in the second
quarter of 2015. Furthermore, the authorities have just announced in the National Reform
Program Update a comprehensive action plan to: (1) finalize the assessment of compliance of
the BNB supervisory practices with the Basel Core Principles, (2) establish a framework of
the recovery and resolution of credit institutions, and (3) conduct an asset quality review
(AQR) and stress test of the entire banking sector. The AQR and stress-test will be based on
methodologies fully compliant with those of the European Central Bank and European
Banking Authority. The authorities are open to the recommendations and will consider a
more systematic approach toward the NPLs reduction, if it fits the country specifics. Given
the uncertain low growth environment, the BNB stands ready to sustain and further develop
the capacity of the banking system and individual credit institutions to withstand shocks.
Bulgaria remains fully engaged in the financial sector reform at the European level. The new
domestic legislation transposing requirements of the EU Directives on Deposit Guarantee
Schemes and Recovery and Resolution of Credit Institutions and Investment Firms is in the
final stage of preparation and will be adopted by mid-2015. Accordingly, consistent
mechanisms to recapitalize the Bulgarian Deposit Insurance Fund and to achieve a
reasonable burden sharing will be steadily implemented. The authorities also envisage closer
cooperation with the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). At the same time, they mind the
asymmetric treatment of non-euro area participants in the SSM because of the absence of
liquidity and capital support as well as the lack of voting rights in the Governing Council of
the ECB for these members. The preparations to join the SSM, however, will serve as a
useful anchor for structural reforms on the road to the euro adoption.

4
Structural Reforms
The authorities recognize the importance of improving public confidence in the reforms.
They are well aware that the near-term challenges should not prevent them from addressing
the critical impediments to long-term economic growth. The reform priorities are stipulated
in the updated National Reform Program, which will be submitted to the European
Commission by the end of April. In 2015, the main focus of the reforms will be to reach a
political consensus on the necessary amendments in the Constitution which would open the
door to deep reforms in justice and intelligence. One of the priorities of the new government
is also a fast development of electronic services of the administration. In addition,
amendments to the Law on Access to Public Information will be adopted by June 2015 to
increase the transparency of public information and assure full compliance with EU
legislation.
Following recent amendments to the Energy Act, the Parliament appointed, last April, a new
independent energy regulator. The energy tariff structure is under review. The government
has also negotiated a more favorable long-term price with some of the key electricity
suppliers, and at the same time has negotiated a schedule for settlement of the existing
arrears.
Being aware of the widespread discontent among the population about the perceived
unfairness of the existing pension package, last month, the authorities published a pension
reform proposal. The proposal aims at reaching an agreement in 2015 on the augmented
package to overturn the long-run deficit in the pension system.
