CYPRUS
Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2009 Consultation with Cyprus
Approved by Ajai Chopra and Ranil Salgado
July 21, 2009

Executive Summary
Context: The global crisis has started to affect Cyprus. The overheating of the economy
in 2007–08 has given rise to vulnerabilities, notably, a highly leveraged private sector,
large current account deficits, and a large exposure of banks to property prices. While the
financial sector is holding up, its size and concentration could pose systemic risks. The
expected economic downturn will worsen credit risk in banks and, under current policies,
pose concerns regarding fiscal sustainability. The steady deterioration in competitiveness
threatens medium-term growth and viability.
Staff views: Early detection and intervention will be key to preventing financial sector
problems from escalating to systemic proportions. The supervisors’ ability to preempt and
manage a crisis should be bolstered. A ½−¾ percent a year public consumption-based
fiscal adjustment would be necessary to meet the government’s objective of medium-term
budget balance and to avoid an unsustainable public debt-deficit cycle. Wage bill control,
public administration reform, and targeted social support would be desirable. The recent
pension reform, while commendable, may need to be bolstered in future. The
government’s structural reform program should be implemented speedily to shore up
competitiveness. The inflation-indexed wage adjustment mechanism (COLA) should
ideally be eliminated or at least better targeted.
Authorities’ views: The government expects to be able to meet its fiscal objectives
without altering current plans. Recommendations to improve financial sector stability
were well received. Reforming the COLA is unlikely to be on the policy agenda.
Mission team: A. Banerji (head), P. Sodsriwiboon (both EUR), and Y. Lu (MCM), joined
by K. Driessen (MCM) to discuss the conclusions of the 2008 Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP). Mr. Galac (OED) also attended.
Interlocutors: Minister of Finance Stavrakis, Governor Orphanides, senior public sector
and parliamentary officials, private banks and businesses, labor unions, and academia.
Outreach: A press conference was held and the concluding statement published.

I. 2008: EURO ADOPTION AND OVERHEATING1
1.
Cyprus appears to be weathering the global crisis reasonably well (Figure 1). It
recorded positive growth in the first quarter of 2009, well above the euro area average, and is
among those that have not required public capital injections into its financial sector. The
relatively benign impact of the crisis is due, in part, to the elimination of exchange rate risk
following euro adoption and to conservative financial sector practices, limited exposure to
toxic assets and strict supervision. The latter has preserved confidence in the financial system
which has not only prevented capital outflows, but also attracted capital from distressed
economies in the region. A domestic demand-based growth—supported by recent large real
wage increases—and a relatively small contribution of manufacturing exports has also
insulated the economy from a deterioration in partner country growth. Past budget surpluses,
low public debt, and the long-awaited enactment of pension reforms have sustained investor
confidence, as evidenced by a successful sovereign bond issue in June 2009.2

Nonetheless, the overheating of the economy during 2007–08 has given rise to
vulnerabilities (Figure 2, Table 1). Growth was largely credit-financed and coincided with
strong real wage growth, low unemployment, significant FDI in the property market, and an
improving business climate. Rapid credit growth

This report reflects discussions with the policymakers of the Republic of Cyprus. It does not cover the areas
not under the effective control of the government of the Republic of Cyprus and assumes no change in the status
quo.

A €1½ billion five-year bond—¾ of the government’s financing needs for 2009—was successfully issued in
June.

3

The CBC reduced the minimum liquidity requirement from 75 to 70 percent for all foreign currency deposits.
Credit growth was also supported by an inflow of non-resident deposits (largely from CIS countries) in response
to financial liberalization, and growing competition for market share following the entry of foreign banks into
Cyprus.

result, households and corporations are highly leveraged, property prices have risen sharply,
and banks and households are exposed to the property market, although loan-to-value ratios
of 70–80 percent should provide banks some buffer against property price declines.
3.
Double-digit and growing current account deficits indicate overheating and
competitiveness problems (Figure 3). The current account deficit widened sharply in
2007−08, although temporary and technical factors partly explain the large headline numbers
of 2008 (18½ percent of GDP).4

sector. The external position could be vulnerable if the current sources of financing—FDI
and non-resident deposits into the banking system—were to decline.5
4.
There was a sharp uptick in inflation in 2008 (Figure 4). Both demand-pull and
cost-push factors contributed, such as a large and positive output gap, high oil and food
prices, and wage increases indexed to past inflation. So did temporary factors such as a
severe drought and euro adoption.
5.
The largely revenue-based fiscal consolidation started unwinding in 2008 (Figure
5). Historically large budget deficits were converted into surpluses by 2007, and public debt
is a low 49½ percent of GDP (mostly domestic and long-term). However, consolidation was
largely revenue-based and, to some extent, dependent on temporary factors, such as a

4

An estimated one-third of the headline current account deficit can be attributed to temporary and technical
factors, e.g. drought-related water imports, higher reinvested profits (with an FDI counterpart in the financial
account), and a one-time increase in car imports following the reduction in excise tax to EU levels ahead of euro
entry.

5

While private sector external debt remains high (421 percent of GDP, including non-resident deposits, about
half of which is short-term), net external debt is small (4 percent of GDP), having declined sharply in 2008 as
banks accumulated assets abroad.

property price boom and a revaluation of assets.6 On the spending side, fundamental reforms
did not materialize while social spending has grown. Besides savings on debt service, the
government has exercised some control over wages, defense and capital expenditures, and
slowed the increase in pension spending by gradually increasing the retirement age and
tightening the pension eligibility criteria somewhat. The recently enacted pension reform
places the burden of adjustment largely on contribution increases and does not address the
large ageing-related increases in pension expenditures. In 2008, the budget surplus started
unwinding due, in part, to the government’s emphasis on untargeted social spending with the
intention of supporting social cohesion. Despite continued growth in output, imports, and
property prices, the 2008 general government budget surplus declined sharply to 0.9 percent
of GDP.
6.
The financial sector is withstanding the global crisis; public recapitalization has
not been necessary. Both resident and non-resident deposits have held steady thanks to
confidence in the banking system, the planned expansion of deposit insurance, and the
relative strength of the banking sector compared to that of the region. Banks reportedly do
not face liquidity problems.
7.
Nevertheless, the banking sector poses risks by virtue of its size and
concentration (Table 2, Figure 6).7 With domestic assets of some 690 percent of GDP, the
financial sector is large relative to the economy. Moreover it is concentrated, with the
landscape dominated by three domestic banking groups—the Bank of Cyprus, Marfin
Popular Bank, and Hellenic Bank—spanning banking, insurance, investment banking, and
asset management subsidiaries. Problems in the banking sector can therefore quickly escalate
to systemic proportions with serious economic repercussions. The big three have also
diversified geographically by tapping emerging European economies. Foreign presence in the
domestic market is growing and significant, with Greece’s Alpha Bank the predominant
foreign player. Banks have been competing aggressively with local cooperative banks—the
second largest presence in the domestic financial sector—for market share, resulting in lower
margins.
8.
Banks are taking steps to preserve profitability and ensure capital adequacy.
They are restructuring balance sheets by increasing interest rate spreads to preserve
profitability, strengthening capital by issuing subordinated or convertible loan capital,
securing funding, and enhancing risk management. Lending has decelerated as underwriting
standards have been tightened to protect asset quality. Deposit rates have started to decline as

Public coffers also benefited from tax increases and a wider tax base due to harmonization with the EU;
stronger profitability and imports; and increases in revenues from land and survey fees.

7

Financial sector discussions are largely based on the conclusions of the September-October 2008 FSAP
mission, also summarized in the accompanying Financial System Stability Assessment report (July 2009).

liquidity concerns have subsided. Overseas operations are under close scrutiny, and have
been frozen in some cases as banks wait for the situation to improve.
9.
The government and CBC have taken action to ensure the soundness of the
banking system (Table 3). There has been significant progress in implementing EU
Directives and recommendations made by the recent FSAP. In particular, deposit insurance
coverage and funding is being increased; a crisis management law is being drafted to
empower the government to preemptively address liquidity or insolvency problems affecting
financial institutions; and a legal and regulatory framework for covered bonds has been
initiated to increase the available collateral for banks to use in order to fully reap the benefits
of the refinancing flexibility offered under the ECB’s facilities.
10.
However, bank soundness indicators have deteriorated and are likely to weaken
further as the downturn progresses (Table 4). Bank profitability has declined due to low
interest margins induced by intense competition, mark-to-market losses on assets, and larger
provision write-offs. NPLs, while low, have risen in all sectors. Capital buffers have
declined.
11.
Reunification remains elusive, although discussions are continuing at the
technical level. Full-fledged settlement negotiations to resolve the decades-long division of
Cyprus got under way in September 2008 as a solution was favored by all concerned parties.
However, progress has been slow and the two sides remain a long way from agreeing on the
major issues that need to be tackled.
II. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: TEPID AND UNCERTAIN
12.
As a small open economy on the outskirts of Europe, Cyprus is unlikely to
remain shielded from the global crisis. Two of its most important economic activities—
construction and financial services—are feeling the pinch, while tourism and exports have
been struggling against low cost competitors for several years. Its most important economic
partners—the U.K., Greece, Russia—are facing economic difficulties of their own.
13.

to have a smaller net impact on growth. With
rising savings and investments delayed until
opportune times, the current account deficit is
expected to improve sharply, helped also by
lower commodity prices.

Growth forecasts are subject to uncertainty; a worse outcome cannot be ruled
out. The international macroeconomic and financial environment is still in flux. Moreover,
the financial sector—a key driver of growth—is vulnerable, and partly reliant on
non-resident funds. These inflows, while so far steady, could deteriorate or strengthen,
depending on the growth outlook in originating countries, and the relative state of their
banking sectors. Finally, while some correction in property prices is envisaged and is already
underway as foreign investments in vacation homes have stalled, data constraints make it
difficult to gauge the amount of adjustment in the pipeline.9
15.
Medium-term recovery will likely be tepid, hindered by impaired
competitiveness. Absent significant improvements in competitiveness, growth is forecast to
recover in line with partner country growth to settle at about a moderate 3 percent per year,
compared to recent growth rates of 4–4½ percent. Private domestic demand will continue to

Households are vulnerable to interest rate increases given the large share of adjustable-rate mortgages.

rigidities delaying property-related transactions.

be the main driver, although unlikely to revert to the levels of 2007–08 on the assumption
that the over-expansion in the housing and credit markets will not return. Net exports would
provide a drag as export market shares stay stagnant while imports recover. As the
savings-investment balance deteriorates, the current account deficit will stay large. The
external position, therefore, still looks vulnerable, especially if the assumed recovery in
non-resident deposit inflows in line with partner country growth is not forthcoming. Growth
is expected to be below potential, even as potential output drops in the near-term due to
lower capital accumulation and capacity utilization and a reduction in the workforce
especially in the worst-hit tourism and construction sectors which rely on immigrant labor.
Over the medium term potential output growth is expected to decline moderately mainly
because of an ageing population which will only partially be compensated by immigration.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS

16.
Discussions focused on policies to manage short-term risks without endangering
medium-term sustainability. The onus is on fiscal policy, financial sector supervision and
structural reforms to deliver the authorities’ medium-term objectives of promoting growth
and fostering social cohesion.
A. Public Finances: Living Within Means
17.
Staff supported the government’s fiscal objectives and priorities. According to
the Stability Program, the government intends to keep the budget deficit below 3 percent of
GDP in 2009–10 and balance the budget over the medium term.10 Moreover, it intends to
curtail public consumption while emphasizing productivity-enhancing investments (mainly
infrastructure), structural reforms and social spending. For a small open economy like
Cyprus, given high import elasticities, fiscal expansion is likely to be less effective in
supporting growth. As markets increasingly differentiate between country risks even within
10

the euro area, the fiscal multiplier could turn negative if large deficits reduce investor
confidence in fiscal sustainability. A conservative fiscal stance would, on the other hand,
help sustain confidence in the financial sector by improving the perceived ability of public
finances to absorb financial sector-related contingent liabilities, and keep public sector
guarantees credible. In particular, a spending-based consolidation is appropriate as it would
be more durable, given international experience. Moreover, although calls for discretionary
tax cuts should be resisted, all agreed that higher tax rates could hurt competitiveness and
impact foreign capital inflows thereby endangering external viability.
18.
Views differed on the expected fiscal outcome for 2009-10 and, therefore, the
need for corrective policies

Fiscal stimulus measures (amounting to 1½ percent of GDP) were announced in late 2008 and will be
implemented in 2009–10. They include temporary tax relief measures for tourism and housing loan subsidies to
support construction.

17
social support measures introduced in past years have not been targeted. Reflecting these
pressures and rising ageing-related costs, the general government deficit is estimated to reach
some 4 percent of GDP in 2009, a sharp reversal from the surpluses of 2007–08, and expand
thereafter. The government’s own estimates indicate a similar trajectory but better outcomes
largely because of more optimistic assumptions about the economic outlook.
19.
Staff indicated that policies would need to be strengthened to achieve the
government’s own objectives. Specifically, the budget deficit would need to be tightened by
an estimated ½−¾ percent of GDP a year on average compared to the baseline, with a
significant upfront course correction in 2009–10. The reduction of the wage bill—a third of
total spending—should be a key priority, although staff acknowledged that this could be met
with stiff resistance from the unions. This would require hiring and wage controls and a more
efficient use of civil servants in the context of a broader public administration reform.12 It
may also be time to extend the concept of flexicurity from the private sector to the public
sector.13 These measures would control the wage bill, reduce the crowding out of the private
sector in the labor market, improve social cohesion, and increase productivity. To further
enhance social cohesion and protect the budget, social support measures should be targeted to
reach the truly needy, a proposal the government was willing to consider. However, it is not
clear whether it intends to revisit the untargeted schemes that were introduced in the past,
also recommended by staff. Finally, staff emphasized that it would be critical that the
temporary stimulus measures be reversed when the economy recovers and that a mediumterm budget framework be introduced in line with the 2006–07 IMF technical assistance.14
20.
The government’s intention to support fiscal policy through improved public
sector asset-liability and cash management is welcome. However, staff noted that an
assessment of total budget liabilities would need to be bolstered by transparently accounting
for contingent liabilities. These would need to be monitored carefully so that overall
exposures do not deteriorate rapidly as economic conditions worsen. In addition, public
sector aid programs (such as the loan guarantee scheme to SMEs) should be designed to
protect competition and minimize moral hazard (by offering partial guarantees) and adverse
selection (limiting guarantees to new lending and to sectors where creditor quality is easily
verifiable).

12

For example, the Public Services Law of 1990 prohibits the redeployment of civil servants across the public
sector.
13

Flexicurity refers to the introduction of flexible but reliable employment contracts in the labor market
(National Reform Programme, October 2008).
14

The recommendations include, inter alia, changes in the legal framework, institutional coverage, forecasting
and presentation, and the modernization of personnel management.

with periodic reviews to assess the Fund’s viability and take necessary corrective actions.
However, although reforms address long-term fiscal sustainability concerns through 2050, by
relying solely on contribution increases, they are disproportionately burdensome to workers
and competitiveness. 15 Staff believed that additional reforms will become necessary over
time, including raising the retirement age in line with other euro area countries, indexing
benefits to prices to reduce spending pressures, and better aligning public and private pension
benefits (including by reducing lump sum payments to the former).
B. Financial Sector: Prevention Is Easier Than a Cure
22.
Given the systemic importance of the large banking sector, there was agreement
that policies must focus on nipping problems in the bud. Moreover, given the important
contribution of the financial sector to growth, its resilience would serve as a bulwark against
a greater deterioration of growth and—via reputational effects—enhance the growth potential
of Cyprus. Furthermore, weaknesses in the financial sector could lead to outflows in
non-resident deposits thereby undermining external sustainability. Therefore, early detection
of risks and intervention will be key to preserving financial sector stability.
23.
Stress tests indicate that the most important risk to financial stability is the
worsening macroeconomic environment. This will likely affect asset quality, revenues and
profitability, since the private sector is highly leveraged, and banks’ credit portfolio remains
relatively untested by an economic slowdown. While the pre-shock total capital adequacy
ratio (CAR), including Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital, remains above the regulatory minimum,
stress tests based on end-2008 balance sheets indicate that the banking system’s large
exposure to real estate and credit risk poses risks. Under extreme assumptions, losses at the
four largest banks could increase by about €3½ billion (20 percent of GDP), reducing the
CAR from about 10½ percent to some 4½ percent. This would imply that capital injections of
some 10½ percent of GDP would be needed to satisfy the minimum CAR of 8 percent.

Risks from counterparty exposure and contagion exist, but have eased in line
with improving global financial conditions. Contagion from Greek parent banks is possible
but unlikely since home country policies to limit systemic risk target financial groups as a
whole, thereby reducing cross-border vulnerabilities.16 Likewise, Cypriot banks’ operations
in Greece and Eastern Europe expose asset quality to a slowdown abroad.17 As net lenders in
the European money market, Cypriot banks have sizeable exposures to European financial
institutions through bond investments, which exposes them to counterparty risk, although
these have eased somewhat as governments and central banks have intervened to support
banking systems in other countries.18,19
25.

reprice more quickly than liabilities. Liquidity buffers are also reasonably high, thanks to
conservative liquidity requirements.
26.
Going forward, there will be a need for continued vigilant supervision and
enhanced cross-border cooperation. Notwithstanding pressure on banks and supervisors to
facilitate credit, it was recognized that Cyprus’ reputation as a financial center depends on
effective and arms length supervision by an independent and accountable central bank. Since
liquidity of even relatively safe assets can suddenly evaporate at times of stress, and
deposits—including non-resident and foreign currency deposits—remain more volatile than
during normal times, staff indicated that the CBC will need to maintain its prudential
regulation on liquidity requirements, implement the CEBS’s guidance on liquidity
management, and closely monitor developments in banks’ funding, cross-border exposures,
and counterparty risk management. Although the authorities wondered whether this was the
right time to tighten capital requirements, staff indicated that the CBC could consider
requiring banks to hold more capital—thereby forcing them to suspend dividend payouts and
bolster capital—given the expected deterioration in asset quality and liquidity risk in the
pipeline. Staff also advised that loan-to-value ratios on second homes may need to be
reviewed in line with property price developments, and that the foreclosure procedure would
need to be shortened to allow for a more rapid property price correction and bank balance
sheet adjustment. All agreed that participation—as host and home supervisor—in supervisory
colleges being set up for the largest EU banks by end-2009 should help strengthen
cross-border supervision. Ongoing work in the EU to strengthen the crisis management
framework (including deposit guarantee funding) is expected to strengthen the Cypriot
authorities’ preparedness further. Finally, staff indicated that, as in other jurisdictions with
large financial systems, the supervisor should consider how to avoid the moral hazard effects
associated with institutions that are “too big to fail”.
27.
The FSAP recommendations to further improve supervision and the safety net
were well received. The stress testing framework should be expanded to include a wider
coverage of institutions (including the cooperatives) and risks. Better monitoring and
cross-checking of results would help risk assessment, as would improved statistics on real
estate and household leverage produced by the Statistical Services of Cyprus (CYSTAT).
Additional resources would be required for supervision and financial stability assessments.
Over the medium term, a single supervisor for all credit institutions operating in Cyprus
could enhance efficiency, and establish a level playing field. Given the integrated nature of
the financial sector in Cyprus, a more integrated supervisory structure based in the CBC
would be preferable to the current sectoral approach.
C. Structural Reforms: Translating Plans Into Action
28.
There is widespread consensus that improving competitiveness will be key to
assisting recovery and enhancing growth potential. The authorities indicated that Cyprus
remains attractive to foreign investors due to strategic, historical, institutional and economic
advantages: a relatively low-tax regime, proximity to middle-eastern markets, regulatory

21
reliability underwritten by the EU and increasing integration with the EU. The economy is
being diversified into new businesses such as shipping, financial services, legal and
accounting services, and repetitive tourism (through the purchases of vacation homes by
foreigners). It is also gaining competitiveness in the non-tourism service sector. However,
staff noted that Cyprus’ global ranking on competitiveness indicators is low (Figure 7),
reflecting the small size of the economy, high labor costs relative to Eastern Europe,
competitiveness problems in the manufacturing and tourism sectors and a wage growth that
has outstripped productivity increases. Cyprus will also need to replace jobs lost in
construction.
29.
According to staff, implementation of the government’s National Reform
Programme has been slow.21 The program contains detailed measures in a broad range of
areas, including measures to reform entitlement programs, the labor market, the business
climate, infrastructure and education, all of which staff considered appropriate and consistent
with the economy’s medium and long-term needs. However, key reforms, such as health care
reform, are likely to be delayed because of a lack of consensus among stakeholders and
technical problems. Staff pushed for speedy implementation, in particular, the streamlining of
red tape and bureaucracy, which, supported by a bloated civil service, was singled out by the
private sector as the biggest impediment to competitiveness.
30.
Wage increases must reflect productivity developments. Staff viewed the
backward-looking automatic indexation mechanism (COLA) as having allowed wage
increases to outstrip productivity, especially in the public sector, thereby hampering
competitiveness. The authorities disagreed and were reluctant to consider changing this
system in any way: the COLA is considered sacrosanct as it is seen to promote social
cohesion and is widely credited—even by businesses—for engendering industrial-labor
peace. Therefore they disagreed with staff’s views that COLA should ideally be eliminated.
Alternatively, staff emphasized that if COLA was to be preserved, it would be imperative to
minimize its damaging effect by keeping inflation under control through productivityenhancing structural reforms including in public administration. It welcomed the willingness
of labor unions, government, and businesses to follow through with the wage cuts determined
by COLA in the second half of 2009. It noted, however, that COLA, as currently practiced,
does not improve social cohesion as it covers and disproportionately benefits the richest 60
percent of employees mainly in the public sector and banks. Staff suggested that alternative
measures could be considered to better achieve social cohesion, for instance, by targeting
COLA more effectively.

Competitiveness Index, 2008-09 1/

Sources: World Economic Forum
1/ The competitiveness index comprises the weighted average of indicators on institutions, infrastructure, macroeconomic stability, health and
primary education, higher education and training, goods market efficiency, labor market efficiency, financial market sophistication, technological
readiness, market size, business sophistication, and innovation.
2/ Lisbon scores are calculated as an unweighted average of the individual scores on information society, innovation and R&D, liberalization,
network industries, financial services, enterprise environment, social inclusion, and sustainable development.
3/ The institutional environment includes the legal framework, the efficiency of public and private institutions, i.e. excessive bureaucracy,
overregulation, corruption, lack of transparency, etc. The higher the indicator, the better the institutions.
4/ Goods market efficiency meaures the impediments to business activity through government intervention such as distortionary or burdensome
taxes and restrictive and discriminatory rules on foreign ownership or foreign direct invesment .
5/ Higher education and training indicates secondary and tertiary enrollment rates as well as the quality of education as assessed by the
business community.

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
The global crisis has started to affect Cyprus. The economy has been relatively
shielded from the crisis until now, largely because of a lesser reliance on exports, euro
adoption, and a resilient financial sector which has not needed public capital injections.
However, the overheating of the economy in 2007–08 has given rise to vulnerabilities which
will need to be managed carefully as the economy slows down. The private sector is highly
leveraged, and banks and households have large exposures to the property market which is
beginning to correct itself. Balance sheets will therefore need to adjust to the new economic
realities. The evaporation of growth is likely to worsen credit risk in the banking sector
which, if they materialize, could have systemic implications given the size and concentration
of banking sector. Moreover, fiscal policies are on an unsustainable path due to significant
and permanent increases in spending at a time when revenues are declining due the economic
cycle and a permanent correction in the property market. Finally, the large current account
deficit—indicating both overheating and competitiveness problems and increasingly financed
by non-resident deposit inflows—may not be sustainable. Going forward, therefore policies
will need to mitigate short-term risks while ensuring medium-term sustainability.
32.
The government’s fiscal objectives are appropriate but policies will need to be
strengthened to achieve those objectives. Given high import elasticities, a fiscal stimulus is
less likely to be effective and could reduce investor confidence in fiscal sustainability. A
conservative fiscal stance would support confidence in the public sector’s ability to cope with
financial sector distress. Without significant course correction in 2009–10, current policies
could imply the beginning of an expansionary debt-deficit cycle which could become
unsustainable. The budget deficit would need to decline by an estimated ½−¾ percent of
GDP a year to achieve the government’s own objective of budget balance over the medium
term.
33.
Fiscal adjustment should rely on reducing public consumption, especially the
wage bill which accounts for a third of total spending. Policies could include hiring and wage
controls and a broader public administration reform including the extension of flexicurity
from the private to the public sector. Social support measures, including those introduced in
the past, should be targeted to reach the truly needy, enhance social cohesion, and protect the
budget. Temporary stimulus measures should be allowed to expire when recovery sets in. A
medium-term budget framework aiming to contain spending below nominal GDP growth and
control public sector employment should be implemented. While the passage of long-delayed
pension reforms is commendable, additional reforms may be needed at some point to reduce
budget spending, including increasing the retirement age, indexing benefits to prices, and
better aligning public and private pension benefits.
34.
Fiscal policy would be well served by a more effective management of public
sector liabilities. The government’s initiative in this regard are welcome and should be
enhanced by transparently accounting for contingent liabilities which would need to be
monitored carefully so that overall exposures do not deteriorate rapidly as economic
conditions worsen. Public sector aid programs should be designed to protect competition and
minimize moral hazard and adverse selection.

24
35.
The financial sector is holding up and risks (mainly credit risk) appear to be
manageable. With assets of some 690 percent of GDP, financial sector problems can quickly
become systemic and the top three banks are “too big to fail”. Thus early detection of risks
and intervention will be key to preserving financial sector stability. A resilient financial
sector would also protect growth, enhance the growth potential of Cyprus, and facilitate
external flows to finance the large current account deficits.
36.
Banks, supervisors and the government have reacted appropriately to the crisis.
The participation in the FSAP is welcome, as is the rapid progress in strengthening
supervision and implementing the FSAP recommendations. However, there will be a need for
continued vigilance and enhanced cross-border cooperation. Cyprus’ reputation as a financial
center depends on the continuation of an effective and arms length supervision by an
independent and accountable central bank. The CBC should closely monitor developments in
banks’ funding, cross-border exposures, and counterparty risk management. In anticipation
of a further deterioration of asset quality and, possibly, liquidity risk, it should require
adequate capital buffers, particularly from systematically important banks. Loan-to-value
ratios on second homes may need to be reviewed in line with property price developments,
and foreclosure procedure would need to be shortened to allow for a more rapid property
price correction and bank balance sheet adjustment.
37.
Further improvements to supervision and the safety net should be effected over
the medium term. The stress testing framework should be expanded and enhanced.
Supervisory resources must be bolstered. Over the medium term, a single supervisor for all
credit institutions operating in Cyprus could enhance efficiency, and establish a level playing
field. Given the integrated nature of the financial sector in Cyprus, a more integrated
supervisory structure based in the CBC would be preferable to the current sectoral approach.
38.
Improved competitiveness will assist recovery and enhance the growth potential.
While Cyprus remains attractive to foreign investors due to strategic, historical, institutional
and economic advantages, its ranking on global competitiveness indicators is low, reflecting
in particular high wage growth compared to productivity increases. The National Reform
Programme should be implemented. In particular, red tape and bureaucracy must be tackled
as a matter of priority.
39.
The deterioration in productivity and unit labor costs must be reversed. Ideally
the COLA should be eliminated as it has resulted in wage increases larger than productivity,
especially in the public sector, thereby hampering competitiveness. Alternatively, the
damaging effect of COLA should be minimized by keeping inflation under control through
productivity-enhancing structural reforms. In addition, amendments to the framework—for
instance by more effectively targeting COLA—should be considered to better achieve social
cohesion.
40.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on a 12-month
cycle.

Table 3. Cyprus: Financial Sector Measures Taken by the Authorities

Crisis Management: A crisis management law is being prepared with EC consultation. This would
empower the government to preemptively address liquidity or insolvency problems in financial
institutions through government loans, government guarantees of loans and issuance of government
bonds to credit institutions; recapitalization of financial institutions in exchange for an ownership
stake; and purchase of a financial institution’s assets.
Deposit Insurance: The deposit guarantee scheme is being expanded to increase the statutory
deposit protection coverage per depositor and per bank to €100,000 for deposits in all currencies.
The payout period will be reduced in line with EU regulations. Since December 2008, the capital of
the Deposit Protection Fund is being gradually raised to €100 million by 2012 with higher
contributions from banks. The maximum amount of required special and/or supplementary
contributions and the ceiling on borrowing by the Fund have been raised.
Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA): There has been progress in establishing guidance for ELA.
The CBC has identified eligible collateral for ELA in bank balance sheets. Applicable haircuts will be
determined through a last minute evaluation of collateral. The policy framework for the provision of
ELA by the CBC is ready to be submitted to the CBC Board for approval; the operational framework is
under preparation. The process for establishing a legal and regulatory framework for covered bonds
has been initiated to facilitate banks’ access to ECB facilities. A draft law is being prepared.
Bank Supervision: The CBC has been implementing the EU regulatory framework and the core
principles for effective banking supervision issued by the Basel Committee. Since October 2008, the
frequency of liquidity returns reporting has been increased. The CBC plans to implement the CEBS's
guidance on liquidity buffer and survival period. In line with FSAP recommendations, the CBC has
increased the frequency of reporting capital adequacy and large exposure limits, reduced limits on
connected lending, and increased monetary penalties. The CBC has participated in the activities of
the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) and placed emphasis on the timely
adoption of EU Directives and the recommendations of the CEBS and of the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision.
Cross-border Supervision: The CBC is collaborating with other supervisors within the framework
established in Memoranda of Understanding and EU-wide cross-border cooperation and
arrangements. In particular, there is frequent exchange of information and consultation with Greek
supervisors, including joint onsite examinations. Cooperation will be further enhanced by the
establishment of supervisory colleges between home and host supervisors. The CBC, as home
supervisors, will establish colleges for the Bank of Cyprus and Marfin Popular Bank, and as host
supervisors will collaborate with home supervisors. The CBC plans to implement the CEBS's Liquidity
Identify Card which aims to provide supervisors of European cross-border banking groups with a
single prudential language to enable meaningful exchanges of information, in particular within
colleges of supervisors.
Bank Resolution: The CBC plans to adopt the EC's policy on early intervention measures to be
issued at end-2009.

Source: Central Bank of Cyprus.
1/ Data for 2005 onwards are for deposit-takers compiled on a domestically-controlled, cross-border consolidation basis (DCCB) and do
not include the cooperative credit institutions and foreign-controlled banks. The ratio of regulatory capital to risk-weighted assets compiled
on a cross-border and cross-sector consolidation basis for all domestically-incorporated (CBCSDI) deposit-takers, which exclude the
cooperative credit institutions but include the former International Banking Units is 13.4 percent, 13.2 percent and 12.5 percent for
2005–07 respectively. Similarly, on a cross-border and cross-sector basis, the ratio of regulatory Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets
was 10.2 percent 10.2 percent and 10.3 percent for 2005–07 respectively.
2/ Data for 2008 and onwards are for deposit-takers compiled on a cross-border and cross-sector for all domestically incorporated
(CBCSDI) basis as well as on a domestic consolidation (DC) basis. Due to methodologic al changes the data for 2008 is not comparable
with historical data.
3/ The numbers are not fully comparable over time. The threshold for classifying loans as non-performing was changed from 6 months in
arrears to 3 months in 2006. Data 2005 onwards are compiled according to the methodology and specifications provided in the IMF
“Compilation G uide on Financial Soundness Indicators.” The decline in nonperforming loan (NPL) ratios since 2005 reflects stricter
lending criteria, repayments and write-offs of NPLs as well as denominator effects (growth in capital/loans).
4/ All non-mortgage household loans.

Consultation

Implementation

Macroeconomic Policies

Ensure continued observance of Maastricht
criteria and smooth adoption of euro.
For 2007, respect spending limits, save excess
revenue. Objectiv e of budget balance by 2010
should be met through checks on current
expenditures. Supplementary budgets should be
banned. Implement pension and health care
reform.

Euro adopted on January1, 2008.

Fiscal Policy

Spending limits respected in 2007, excess
revenues saved. No supplementary budgets.
However, current spending increased in 2008.
Pension reform enacted but measures are
mostly revenue-based. Healthcare reform
delayed due to a lack of consensus and
technical factors.

Financial Sector Policy

Monitor credit and house price developments to
contain financial sector risks. Strengthen financial
supervision by unifying superv ision, improving
resources and independence, completing FSAP.

FSAP completed. Supervision improved in line
with EU directives and FSAP
recommendations. Stress testing framework
introduced and monitoring improved.

Structural Policies

Implement National Lisbon Program. Redesign
wage-setting by aligning real wage growth to
productiv ity developments. Improve competition.

The National Reform Programme is being
implemented but slowly. Wage increases hav e
continued to outstrip productiv ity especially in
the manufacturing and public sector.

ANNEX II. CYPRUS: STATISTICAL INFORMATION
As of July 14, 2009
A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: The transition to the new European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA
1995) has complicated the analysis of national accounts and fiscal data. The new national
accounts do not provide information on the disposable income of households, thus hindering
the calculation of the household saving ratio.
Financial sector data: The currency-linked and indexed bonds held by nonresidents are
classified as domestic instead of foreign liabilities.
External debt: The authorities have recently decided to include non-resident deposits in
resident banks in gross external debt.
Other: Data on property prices and household sector assets do not exist.
B. Data Standards and Quality
Cyprus is planning to subscribe to the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS)
shortly. No data ROSC is available.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with
Cyprus
On August 5, 2009 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
2009 Article IV consultation with Cyprus.1
Background
The global crisis is beginning to affect Cyprus. The economy has been relatively shielded from
the crisis so far, recording positive growth in the first quarter of 2009, well above the euro area.
The financial sector has not required public capital injections. The relative resilience is due to
the elimination of exchange rate risk following euro adoption, conservative financial sector
practices with limited exposure to toxic assets and strict supervision, and a domestic
demand-based growth with less reliance on manufacturing exports. However, the economy is
beginning to slow in response to the global crisis. Growth is projected to fall sharply to
⅓ percent in 2009 as banks and the private sector restructure balance sheets. On current
policies, a tepid but uncertain recovery is expected to begin starting 2010.
Despite its resilience so far, the economy is slowing down and risks are increasing. The
overheating of the economy in 2007–08 has left the private sector highly leveraged, and banks
and households exposed to the property market. The expected slowdown will increase credit
risk in banks, which, in some plausible but unlikely extreme scenarios, could have systemic
implications given the size and concentration of the banking sector. The government and the
Central Bank of Cyprus (CBC) have taken action to ensure the soundness of the banking
system. There has been significant progress in implementing EU Directives and
recommendations made by the recent Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). In
particular, deposit insurance coverage and funding has increased; a crisis management law is
being drafted to empower the government to preemptively address liquidity or insolvency
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
problems; and a legal and regulatory framework for covered bonds has been initiated to
facilitate the availability of refinancing under the ECB’s facilities. Nevertheless bank soundness
indicators are being adversely affected by the economic environment.
Large current account deficits partly indicate competitiveness problems especially in the
manufacturing and tourism sectors. In particular, the backward-looking automatic indexation
mechanism (COLA) has recently contributed to wages outstripping productivity increases. The
external position would therefore be vulnerable if the current sources of financing—foreign
direct investment and non-resident deposit flows into the banking system—were to decline.
While there has been progress—albeit slow—in implementing the wide-ranging structural
reforms of the government’s National Reform Programme, reforming the COLA is not part of the
agenda at this juncture.
The largely revenue-based fiscal consolidation has started unwinding. This is due to softening
growth, the lapse of temporary revenue-generating factors, and increases in untargeted social
spending starting 2008. Although important pension reforms were recently enacted, they rely
mainly on contribution increases and do not yet fully address the large ageing-related increases
in pension expenditures. Fiscal policies could potentially become unsustainable if current
policies, which significantly increase the inelastic component of budget spending (especially
payroll), are implemented.
Executive Board Assessment
The Executive Directors noted that Cyprus has weathered the crisis well. The overheating of the
economy in 2007–08 has given rise to certain risks that would need to be managed carefully as
the economy slows. Policies would need to mitigate short-term risks while ensuring mediumterm sustainability.
Directors endorsed the government’s objective to achieve a balanced budget over the medium
term. They noted that, based on strengthened policies, the budget deficit will need to decline by
about ½−¾ percent of GDP a year with a significant upfront correction to avoid unfavorable
debt-deficit dynamics going forward. Directors emphasized that fiscal adjustment should rely on
reducing public consumption, particularly the wage bill, and on broader public administration
reforms. They considered that the temporary stimulus measures should be allowed to expire
once the recovery sets in, and the social support measures should be carefully targeted to the
needy. Directors welcomed the passage of pension reforms. A few Directors considered that
additional pension reforms may be necessary in future, including raising the retirement age and
better aligning public and private benefits.
Directors recommended the adoption of a medium-term budget framework and more effective
management of public sector liabilities. The government’s recent initiative in this area could be
further enhanced by monitoring contingent liabilities and minimizing the possibility of moral
hazard and adverse selection in public sector aid programs.

3
Directors were reassured that financial sector risks appear to be manageable. Nonetheless,
given the size and concentration of the financial sector, they expressed concern that problems
can potentially become systemic, underscoring the importance of early detection of risks and
intervention to preserve financial sector stability. They encouraged the Central Bank of Cyprus
(CBC) to enhance monitoring of banks’ funding, cross-border exposures, and counterparty risk
management. With the potential for a further deterioration in asset quality, the CBC should
require higher capital buffers, particularly from systemically-important banks.
Directors recommended that supervision and the safety net be further improved over the
medium term. They noted that Cyprus’ reputation as a financial center relies on continued
effective supervision by an independent and accountable central bank. In the view of most
Directors, a single supervisor for all credit institutions and a more integrated supervisory
structure in the CBC should be considered. The stress-testing framework should be enhanced
and supervisory and financial stability resources bolstered. Directors welcomed Cyprus’
participation in a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), and called for implementation
of its recommendations.
Directors underlined the importance of improving competitiveness to assist the recovery and
support external viability. They encouraged the authorities to reverse the deterioration in
productivity and unit labor costs by implementing the broad-ranging National Reform Program,
including cutting red tape, streamlining the bureaucracy, and implementing other structural
reforms. Directors supported eliminating the automatic wage indexation mechanism (COLA) or
mitigating its impact through productivity improvements and better targeting.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or
countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with
member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring,
and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are
also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by
the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat Reader to view

Statement by Age Bakker, Executive Director for Cyprus
and Tomislav Galac, Advisor to Executive Director
August 5, 2009
The Cypriot economy has performed well amidst the global financial and economic crisis.
The financial sector has been little affected by the contraction of global liquidity and the
increase in risk aversion. This can be mostly attributed to a positive effect of the EMU entry
at the beginning of 2008, to tight banking regulation and supervision, and to traditionally
conservative business models of Cypriot banks, which account for about eighty percent of the
total financial system assets. The real sector has also shown resilience against the slumping
external demand and tightening of financing conditions. This was mostly due to continued
strong domestic demand, driven by still robust employment, wage growth, and credit growth.
With this backdrop, the authorities held constructive discussions with the Fund team led by
Ms. Banerji during its stay in Nicosia in June 2009. The Cypriot authorities value their
continuing cooperation with the International Monetary Fund, and given the relative
importance of Cyprus as an international financial center, they welcome the continuation of
the Article IV cycle on a twelve month basis. The authorities especially welcome the
thorough staff analysis produced by the Fund team during the 2009 Article IV Consultations
with Cyprus and offer the following comments for the Executive Board discussion.
Recent Economic Developments and Prospects
While there was a modest reduction in the tourism revenue in 2008, and the construction
sector weakened towards the end of the year, private consumption remained at satisfactory
levels, the important business services sector was moderately affected, and health and
education services as well as public investment recorded a significant growth during the year.
Overall, during 2008, the economy recorded real growth of 3.7 percent, slightly down from
the 4.1 average of recent years, while the unemployment rate has reached a record low level
of 3.7 percent. The relatively high consumer price inflation of 4.4 percent for the year and
record high current account deficit of 18.3 percent of GDP, can be mainly attributed to the
energy and food price developments in the first half of the year. Buoyant private consumption
boosted imports and contributed also significantly to the widening of the current account.
Looking ahead, Cyprus is the only EU economy expected to record positive economic
growth in 2009, although there are downside risks. However, all the leading indicators of
economic activity point to a deceleration of growth, that may persist throughout next year.
The extent of the slowdown will depend on the effectiveness of the sizable fiscal stimulus
that the authorities have been undertaking since the second half of 2008. Equally important
will be the global and regional economic and financial developments, as well as those in the
Euro zone, the UK, and Russia - the most important markets for Cypriot exports and capital
inflows. A downside risk for growth in the short run may be posed by the recently widening
interest rate spreads in Cyprus relative to their EMU benchmarks, both on deposits and on
loans. The authorities are also continuously monitoring energy and food prices, since both
consumer prices and current account developments in Cyprus are very sensitive to those two
external factors.

2
In the central scenario, the authorities now expect real growth between 0.4 and 1.0 percent,
both in 2009 and 2010, with a significant improvement in the trade deficit in the period
2009–11, on account of significantly lower imports. Lower expected imports are primarily
related to food and energy, due to their lower prices, and to large-ticket durable consumer
goods, due to a lower domestic credit growth. The most recent Fund forecast is for a growth
of 0.3 percent in 2009, and 1.0 in 2010, not far off the authorities' mark. The main
contribution to growth in the short term will come from public spending and investment, and
from an improvement in net exports. Business services are also anticipated to perform well,
while revenues in tourism and construction are expected to decline markedly. In these
circumstances, the authorities expect unemployment to rise to between 5 and 5¾ percent in
2009 and 2010. In the medium term, the authorities expect the economy to return to the path
of average growth of about 3 percent per year, supported by a further diversification of the
strong services sector.
The authorities expect an increase in non-performing assets in the banking sector in 2009 and
2010 which will be more pronounced in lending to enterprises in the disproportionately
affected sectors. In lending to households, traditional reliance on a family-provided safety
net, secure employment, and overcollateralization should lead to minimal loan losses.
However, declining rates of credit growth will eat into banks' profit margins. As an early
indication, bank and credit cooperatives' profits have halved in the first quarter of 2009
relative to the same period a year ago. Nevertheless, given the strong initial position of the
financial sector, and the relative strength of the economy, the authorities do not envisage an
alarming rise in system-wide risks due to the anticipated short-term economic developments.
Such an assessment is confirmed by the top-down and bottom-up bank stress tests carried out
by the central bank for the years ended in 2007 and 2008, also verified by the Fund during
the October 2008 FSAP and the current Article IV consultation. The mitigating factors in the
household lending segment should also shield the credit cooperatives which lend only to
households, and hold the remaining twenty percent of domestic deposits in Cyprus. In
addition, the banks have recently raised fresh capital to prepare for the anticipated rise in loan
losses.
Economic Policies
In this environment, given the relatively low level of public debt (below 50 percent of GDP
at end-2008), and the strong initial conditions and recent performance of the financial sector,
the authorities intend to pursue anti-cyclical fiscal and financial sector policies. In the fiscal
area, full operation of automatic stabilizers will be allowed while the discretionary measures
will focus on supporting tourism, on additional spending on vulnerable groups, and
especially on small scale local investment in infrastructure, to support employment in the
heavily affected construction sector. The total budgetary impact of the 2009 fiscal stimulus is
estimated at a cost of 1.5 percent of GDP. With the revenues also falling short of projections,
the authorities now expect the general government shortfall in 2009 and 2010 of the order of
2.5 to 3.0 percent of GDP, and will do everything possible to constrain the deficit-to-GDP
ratio from exceeding the 3 percent level. On the other hand, the authorities will also watch
for the possible lagged positive effects from the Euro area and UK stimuli, and from
catching-up of domestic interest rates with the lower EMU level, and adjust domestic policies
accordingly.

3
The authorities have recently adopted one important piece of legislation while working on
two others that should further strengthen the liquidity, confidence, and crisis management
capacity in the financial sector. The first concerns the new regulations governing the
operation of the two deposit insurance schemes, which have quintupled the coverage to
100,000 euro, removed the 10% coinsurance clause, and have covered deposits in all
currencies, both for commercial banks and for credit cooperatives, in line with EU
legislation. The second legislation, still in draft form, concerns the crisis management law
which should allow the government to take decisive but temporary action in a low probability
case of liquidity or solvency problems in individual locally incorporated credit and other
financial institutions without prior Parliamentary approval. Third, the covered bond draft law
and the related changes to other pieces of legislature are being discussed in order to improve
the access of Cypriot banks to the ECB liquidity facilities.
Additionally, the authorities are in the process of analyzing and implementing
recommendations of the recent FSAP mission by the IMF, and a number of recommendations
have already been implemented, especially those related to transparency, and corporate
governance in the financial sector. Moreover, the authorities intend to further improve the
financial regulation framework immediately following the conclusion of the ongoing EUwide discussions on the regulation of credit rating agencies, alternative and collective
investment schemes, and others. Finally, the cooperation among the domestic supervisory
agencies has further strengthened in practice. For example, since May, the Central Bank of
Cyprus and the Authority for the Supervision and Development of Cooperative Societies
have begun carrying out joint on-site supervision of cooperatives, and all supervisory
agencies cooperated in designing the corporate governance code of conduct for financial
intermediaries.
Structural Reforms
While the authorities are now focused on mitigating the effects of the global economic crisis,
they continue to work diligently on pursuing their national reform program pursuant to the
Lisbon agenda. Most notably, the Social Security Fund reform package was adopted by the
Parliament in April, securing the financial sustainability of the social pension scheme until
2050. The reform includes both increased contributions and stricter eligibility criteria for
enjoying the benefits provided by the scheme. While the Government and social partners
recognize that demographic pressures will persist in the very long run, they consider that the
recent reforms have settled the issue for a considerable period, and stress that the authorities
must now give attention to other key issues, such as healthcare reforms. Indeed, the complex
process of decentralization of the public health system has been progressing slower than
envisaged. In addition, the national life-long learning strategy is being implemented to meet
the demands of the dynamic labor market. To support further growth and diversification of
the economy, major infrastructure investments are currently being implemented, including a
new airport, and water desalination plants.
Conclusion
Against the above background, the authorities are confident that Cyprus will maintain its
position as a competitive principal international financial center, and a well-diversified
service-oriented economy. Moreover, they believe that its internationally recognized

4
advantages - the low tax burden, strong legal and institutional base, skilled and multilingual
labor, strategic location, and proactive business-friendly government policies - will not only
keep supporting competitiveness in these areas, but will allow the economy to diversify
further. Recent successes in health and education tourism are the first steps in this direction.
