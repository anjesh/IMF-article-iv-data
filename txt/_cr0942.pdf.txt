Discussions. Discussions on the 2008 Article IV consultation and on a six-month Emergency PostConflict Assistance (EPCA) program were initiated in Moroni during July 25−August 8, 2008, and
finalized in Washington DC during October 10–13, 2008. The mission team consisted of
Messrs. Matungulu (head), Baldini, Benicio and Hartley (all AFR). It held meetings with the President of
the Union, HE Ahmed A. M. Sambi; the Presidents of Ngazidja, Anjouan and Moheli Islands; the Union
Finance and Budget Minister, Mr. Mohamed Ali Soilihi; the Governor and Deputy Governor of the
Central Bank of the Comoros (BCC), Messrs. Abdoulbastoi and Chanfiou; and other senior officials of
the government. Other mission interlocutors were members of the donor community, the private sector
and civil society. The team also worked closely with staffs of the AfDB, World Bank and EU.
EPCA and Rapid-Access ESF assistance. The authorities are requesting assistance under the EPCA
(SDR 1.1 million, or 12.5 percent of quota) to address the immediate post-conflict challenges of
reestablishing inter-island cooperation, initiating restoration of fiscal viability, and beginning to address
core economic distortions to gradually put the economy on a path of stronger and sustainable growth. The
EPCA-supported program lays the ground for possible resumption of Fund assistance under the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), eventually leading to debt relief under the HIPC and MDRI. To
address the impact of higher fuel and food prices on the balance of payments in 2008, the authorities have
also requested a disbursement under the Rapid-Access Component of the Exogenous Shocks Facility
(ESF) in an amount equivalent to SDR 2.2 million or 25 percent of quota.
Comoros, a member of the Franc Zone, has accepted the obligations under Article VIII and
maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international
transactions.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

In a tenuous political situation, the authorities have recently taken steps to begin
addressing core economic vulnerabilities. In recent years, real GDP growth has
been well below the regional average and per capita income has steadily declined.
Moreover, rising food and energy costs have worsened the external position; and the
external debt burden is far above the HIPC threshold. To reverse the deteriorating
trend, the authorities have initiated measures in 2008 to contain the fiscal deficit and
begin addressing macroeconomic and structural impediments to growth. Membership in
the franc zone, the main anchor of stability, is helping contain pressures on domestic
prices.

•

Efforts are made to restore fiscal sustainability. The authorities have resumed
inter-island cooperation in budget and economic management, and are endeavoring to
strengthen the fiscal position through revenue enhancement and better control of the
wage bill. A Union-based revised budget has been submitted to parliament and the
authorities have reestablished the revenue-sharing mechanism. They are endeavoring
to achieve the 2008 fiscal targets to provide confidence to donors and to the private
sector regarding government readiness to put the budget on a sustainable path. Fiscal
gaps should be filled with grants, in order to maintain debt sustainability.

•

There is no evidence that the real exchange rate is misaligned. However, Comoros
faces a current account disequilibrium giving rise to an unstable external position
prior to the receipt of debt relief; there is a need to stem persistent erosion of
competitiveness with growth-supporting structural reforms.

•

The authorities have started tackling structural impediments to growth. They
have upwardly revised petroleum products prices and electricity tariffs and intend to
establish a flexible-pricing mechanism for these products; this is critical to making
power supply more reliable, a key growth-supporting ingredient. The authorities also
plan to accelerate preparations for reforms of state-owned enterprises with World
Bank support, and to ensure an early completion of the final PRSP.

•

Staff recommends Board approval of the authorities’ request for assistance
under the EPCA and Rapid-Access Component of the ESF. While the proposed
reform agenda appears appropriate, the main risk is that implementation could be
hampered by difficulties in mustering the necessary domestic political consensus.

5

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Comoros is emerging from a long period of political instability punctuated by at
least twenty violent transfers of presidential powers since independence from France in
1975. Progress in nation building and political reconciliation has been slow. In 2001, a new
constitution created the Union of the Comoros, providing for each of the three islands to have
its own president and parliament. This was followed by the landmark election of the first
Union president in May 2006. However, a crisis emerged in June 2007 when alleged
irregularities in the election of Anjouan island president Bacar prompted the Union
government, backed by the African Union (AU) and the Arab League, to reject the ballot’s
results. Colonel Bacar refused to heed international calls for new elections, becoming de
facto a rebel leader. Inter-island cooperation disintegrated as a result, preventing Board
consideration of a PRGF-supported program that had been negotiated by staff, with adverse
effects on economic management, donor support, and growth.
2.
Colonel Bacar was removed from power in March 2008, and a new island
president was successfully elected on Anjouan on June 29. In this new context, the
authorities intend to take steps to rekindle growth and enhance the effectiveness of their
poverty reduction strategy. They face daunting challenges, including weakened human and
administrative capacity and dilapidated economic and social infrastructure.
3.
Comoros growth record is poor. Real GDP growth has been well below the regional
average and per capita income has steadily declined in recent years (see Box 1). Economic
activity is largely confined to subsistence agriculture, three export crops, import-related
commerce, and government services. Fiscal policy is constrained by erratic fiscal revenues, a
bloated civil service wage bill, and an external debt that is far above the HIPC threshold.
Membership in the franc zone, the main anchor of stability, has nevertheless helped contain
pressures on domestic prices.

6

Box 1. Comoros: Protracted Road to Recovery: Challenges to Macroeconomic Stability
and Faster Growth
A very narrow export base, with vanilla and cloves accounting for more than ¾ of total export receipts, makes the
economy highly vulnerable to international price swings, although large inflows of remittances have provided a buffer
to consumption and imports, while the exchange rate peg under the Franc Zone arrangement has helped keep inflation
low and official reserves relatively strong.
Dilapidated economic and social infrastructure and a poor business environment have discouraged private sector
initiative and kept foreign direct investment at bay.
Against this background, long periods of political and economic instability have undermined institutional capacity,
prevented effective implementation of reform policies, and contributed to weak growth and declining per capita
incomes.
In the fiscal area, driven by volatile revenue collection efforts and weak public expenditure management, the country
has experienced marked concentration of spending on politically-driven wage settlements, chronic external and
domestic payments arrears, and a debt burden well above the HIPC thresholds. Donor support has remained low.

Advice

Status

National reconciliation process

• Restore inter-island cooperation

The revenue-sharing mechanism has been reestablished, and a
revised Union-based budget for 2008 has been approved by
parliament.

Public finances and fiscal
sustainability

• Strengthen public finances and
improve fiscal governance

•

Address the unsustainable debt
burden and garner additional
donor assistance

Improved inter-island cooperation in customs and tax
administration, implementation of ASYCUDA++ and other
revenue-enhancing measures, including the introduction of a single
taxpayer identification number system, are improving revenue
collection and tax compliance. However, further improvements in
PFM are needed.
Arrears clearance agreements were reached with key creditors in
December 2007. However, the external debt continues to be
unsustainable, pending eligibility to debt relief under the HIPC and
MDRI. Unlocking additional donor assistance will be facilitated by
Fund reengagement under the EPCA and, eventually, the PRGF.

Enabling growth

• Reform public monopolies and
begin implementing the strategy.

• Address competitiveness and
develop the financial sector.

•

Improve transport and
communications infrastructure

• Revise the poverty reduction
strategy to explicitly link growth
and poverty reduction.

The long political crisis has delayed reform of public monopolies,
with difficulties notably in privatizing the state-owned
telecommunications company. Under the EPCA, the authorities
plan to seek World Bank assistance in the design and
implementation of a public enterprise reform strategy.
The cost of doing business is still very high, even by regional
standards. More reforms are needed in this area. Financial
intermediation is expanding with the establishment of two new
commercial banks.
Poor expenditure management and faltering donor support continue
to limit investment spending and frustrate infrastructure
rehabilitation efforts.
In a difficult political environment, progress in implementing the
2006 I-PRSP and finalizing the full PRSP has been slow,
exacerbated by weak institutional capacity. The full PRSP is now
scheduled to be completed by end-2008, with support from the
World Bank.

8

II. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN 2007 AND 2008
4.
In a precarious political environment, economic conditions have dramatically
deteriorated in the Comoros since the last Article IV report was issued in 2006
(Figure 1). In 2007, real GDP grew a scanty ½ percent, compared with an annual average of
2½ percent during 1999–2006. Business activities, especially imports, were hard hit by
political tensions with Anjouan and limited credit availability—as the country’s sole
commercial bank curtailed operations in the wake of a disputed lawsuit. A modest up tick in
construction and retail sales in the final quarter was not sufficiently robust to lift the economy
out of a deep mid-year decline. Economic activity remained subdued in the first half of 2008,
and real GDP growth is likely to stagnate at ½ percent in 2008. In addition to a further
decline in the terms of trade, growth is held back by a difficult energy situation following
cancellation in April 2008 of a long-standing fuel supply contract with France’s TOTAL.
5.
In 2007, inflation rose sharply to 4.5 percent driven by higher food and fuel
prices. This prompted the government to issue ordinances regulating retail prices for key
basic foodstuffs late in the year, and to extend a 1995 freeze on domestic fuel prices. Endyear inflation is projected to accelerate to 9.6 percent in 2008, spurred by continuing
pressures from rising world food and fuel prices in the initial 9 months of the year.
6.
Fiscal performance has weakened further in 2007–08, although corrective
measures are being taken for 2009 and the medium term. The domestic primary fiscal
deficit increased to 2.2 percent of GDP in 2007. Third-quarter revenue and current spending
outturns for 2008, including for wages, appear to be as targeted under the revised 2008
budget, suggesting that the domestic primary fiscal deficit will further rise to 2.7 percent of
GDP in 2008. In the absence of adequate aid disbursements, new domestic and external
payment arrears are being accumulated as sizable external debt service obligations fall due.
7.
Monetary conditions remain appropriately tight. Broad money increased by
a modest 1.1 percent in 2007, with declining domestic credit offsetting gains in net foreign
assets. Reflecting increased financial intermediation, broad money growth is to accelerate to
around 7 percent in 2008, matching that of nominal GDP.
8.
External conditions have considerably deteriorated. In the face of steady real
appreciation of the Euro-pegged Comoros franc, and with the terms-of-trade declining by an
annual average of 16 percent in the last three years, the external current account deficit hit the
equivalent of 6.7 percent of GDP in 2007. The deficit is projected to widen further to
8.7 percent of GDP in 2008—mostly on account of higher energy and food prices in the
initial months of the year. At a projected 236 percent of exports in NPV terms at end-2008,
Comoros’ external debt is unsustainable.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS UNDER THE ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
9.
Against a backdrop of improved prospects for a return of political stability, the
authorities stressed the urgent need to initiate growth-supporting reforms to address
poverty more effectively over the medium to long term. They concurred on the need for a
policy agenda that seeks to urgently begin strengthening public finances and tackling core
economic vulnerabilities. Accordingly, the Article IV discussions were centered around three
main topics:
•

Medium-term macroeconomic prospects and objectives;

•

Fiscal policy and key revenue-enhancing and expenditure-reducing measures to
kick off fiscal consolidation, and policies to secure debt viability;1

•

Structural policies to address eroding economic competitiveness, with a focus
on the energy and financial sectors and on economic diversification to foster private
sector development.

Discussions also addressed several Article IV-specific issues, including measures to improve
the quality and timeliness of economic statistics.
A. Medium-Term Macroeconomic Prospects and Objectives
10.
Comoros’ medium-term prospects will be shaped by the authorities efforts to
(i) achieve gradual fiscal consolidation while increasing pro-poor and pro-growth spending
and enhancing institutional capacity; (ii) attract higher donor financial and technical
assistance; and (iii) promote private sector development by addressing core economic
distortions and energy and financial sector bottlenecks. In the absence of major investment in
agriculture, which represents over 50 percent of total value added, growth will likely remain
relatively subdued despite some revival of activity in tourism and donor-funded public works.
In this context, the main elements of the medium-term macroeconomic framework would be
as indicated below (Text table 1):
•

1

An annual average real GDP growth of 1½ percent during 2008–11, underpinned
by subsistence agriculture’s supply response to higher food prices, some pick up
in private sector activity, including investment in tourism, and a modest rebound
in donor-funded public works. After an initial uptick sparked by rising world food
and fuel prices, inflation is projected to decline to a trend 3-percent annual
average during the period, anchored by the exchange rate peg.

See Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) 2008, which assesses Comoros’
external public debt dynamics based on the conclusions of an updated joint World Bank-Fund LIC-DSF for 2008.

11
•

A widening of the external current account deficit to 10–11 percent of GDP,
reflecting limited export volume gains and stronger worker remittances-funded
imports following the end of the political conflict. FDI is expected to increase in
line with identified investment projects in banking and tourism, including major
revamping of some vacation resorts on the island of Ngazidja. As a result of these
developments, external reserves are projected to decline to 5–6 months of imports.
Assuming good performance under both the EPCA-supported program and a
possible successor arrangement under the PRGF, broad external stability would be
achieved over the next three years, when debt relief under the enhanced HIPC
Initiative and MDRI is eventually delivered. As a result, the NPV of debt-toexports ratio would decline to sustainable levels, from an annual average of
223 percent during 2008–11.

•

A gradual reduction of the deficit on the domestic primary balance to about
1 percent of GDP by 2011 (2.2 percent in 2007), accommodating some increase in
pro-growth spending thanks to a concomitant decline in the wage bill.

11.
There are considerable risks to the medium-term macroeconomic outlook. Key
downside factors include continued political fragility, inadequate and delayed donor
disbursements, as well as weak policy implementation capacity. The absence of donor
support could lead to the accumulation of more wage arrears, reigniting political instability,
and to delays in effecting reforms crucial to restoring fiscal sustainability. Also, persistent
tensions in the global economy add risks to the outlook, with any further deterioration in the
terms of trade negatively affecting real domestic incomes, prices, and competitiveness. Strict
adherence to proposed budgetary and structural reforms will be key to mitigate these risks.
B. Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy
12.
The mission discussed the outline of a fiscal program aimed at achieving fiscal
sustainability, broader macroeconomic stability, and stronger growth over the medium
term. Under the strategy, revenue is to rise by an annual average of ½ percentage point, to
13½ percent of GDP by 2011. Together with restrained wage payments, this would allow
moderate strengthening of pro-poor and pro-growth spending, as the government endeavors

12
to restore macroeconomic stability by keeping demand-induced inflationary pressures in
check. The strategy seeks to achieve modest surpluses on the primary budget balance by
2013, from a deficit equivalent to an annual average of 1½ percent of GDP during 2008–11.
The overall fiscal deficit (cash basis, including already identified grants) would be contained
to an annual average of 2 percent of GDP during the latter period; and the residual financing
gap would have to be filled mostly with additional grants, consistent with recommendations
from the 2008 DSA. However, in the absence of comprehensive debt relief under the
enhanced HIPC Initiative, the NPV of debt (domestic and external) would remain close to
30 percent of GDP by 2011 (Text Figure 2).

13.
The mission discussed the specifics of the above medium-term fiscal strategy,
with a focus on revenue, expenditure, the treatment of domestic arrears payments, and
public expenditure management (PEM).
•

Revenues. The key revenue measures are aimed at expanding the tax base and
strengthening the efficiency of tax and customs administration. Recent measures
already taken include (i) introduction of a single taxpayer identification number
system, (ii) implementation of ASYCUDA++ for customs revenue management,
(iii) completion of a census of large taxpayers and a refocusing of the large taxpayer
unit’s activities, and (iv) efforts to reduce ad hoc customs and tax exemptions. Other
revenue-enhancing measures, under review, would be considered in the context of the
budget law for FY 2009.

13

Box 3: Comoros: Debt Status and Prospects
The African Development Bank’s arrears clearance operation of December 2007 greatly reduced
Comoros’ debt burden (Tables 5 and 6). The external public debt-to-GDP ratio fell to 56.7 percent in
2007 from 67.4 percent in 2006. At end-2007, domestic public debt stood at an estimated 3.3 percent of
GDP—including outstanding short-term Central Bank advances to the Treasury.
Comoros is in debt distress. The 2008 DSA shows that in the absence of HIPC and MDRI debt relief
most debt indicators would remain above the relevant policy-dependent thresholds even in the absence of
shocks (Joint IMF/World Bank DSA 2008). After an assumed completion point in the next three years,
Comoros’ debt becomes sustainable, including under a variety of shock scenarios. Fiscal sustainability
analysis confirms these results. As expected, the analysis notes that the authorities could also improve
debt sustainability through determined implementation of growth-enhancing structural reforms (including
measures to achieve fiscal consolidation, improve the business environment, and promote private sector
development).

•

Expenditures. Projected at 73 percent of total revenue and 60 percent of primary
current expenditure in 2008, wage outlays are the single most important spending
item in the budget (Text Figure 4). Their rapid increase in recent years has weakened
government savings and crippled its ability to support public investment and growth.
In the face of erratic and weak revenue performance, increasing wage expenditures
have caused the accumulation of large payments arrears, hampering macroeconomic
stability. Going forward, the authorities concurred that reining in the wage bill would
be the single most important element of their spending policy. Under the latter, the
wage bill is to be reduced to below 8 percent of GDP by 2013 (9 percent of GDP in
2008). Corrective measures introduced and/or envisaged include (i) a freeze on civil
service recruitments, effective August 8, 2008; (ii) a reduction of government
ministerial portfolios from 35 to 26, effective November 2008; (iii) full
computerization of the civil service payment roster by end-December 2008;
(iv) implementation of a computer-based, integrated, payroll management system by endDecember 2008; and (v) adoption of organic frameworks setting the appropriate
structure and optimal level of civil service staffing, by end-June 2009. Following the
full implementation of the management system for wages, the authorities are expected
to introduce additional reforms to improve civil service operations and reduce staffing
levels, with technical assistance from donors.

•

Public Expenditure Management. To improve expenditure execution and
monitoring, the authorities are issuing monthly budget execution reports—as from
September 2008, and holding quarterly meetings of the Budgetary Committee made
up of representatives from the Union and the three islands. They will consult with the
Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) working group and relevant

14
donors (EU, World Bank) to finalize a framework for implementing and monitoring
recent PEFA recommendations.2
•

Domestic arrears. Provisional data put outstanding domestic payments arrears at
18 percent of GDP at end-December 2007, about half of which to private suppliers
(8 percent of GDP) and one third in unpaid salaries (5 percent of GDP, Text Figure 4).
The authorities intend to conduct an audit of these arrears and, to that effect, have
committed to hiring a firm of international repute which will also prepare a
comprehensive arrears clearance strategy before end-June 2009.3
C. Exchange Rate, Monetary Policy, and Financial Sector Developments

Exchange rate policy
14.
The mission discussed the suitability of the current exchange rate peg under the
Franc Zone arrangement.4 This has provided the main anchor for stability and has been
effective in keeping inflation low (Text Figure 5). Thus, the authorities continue to view the
arrangement as appropriate, notwithstanding pending pressures on the external position.
15.
Staff reviewed Comoros’ lackluster economic competitiveness as evidenced by
weak export performance and growing external imbalances (Figure 2). It drew attention
to developments in the real effective exchange rate, which appreciated by an estimated
29 percent during 2000–07, mainly due to the strengthening of the Euro vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar.
The mission noted that while poor data quality argues for caution in interpreting the
results, analysis suggests that the real exchange rate is nevertheless broadly in line with
fundamentals (Box 3 and related selected issues paper). The mission stressed, and the
authorities concurred on, the need to implement structural reforms, including measures to
reduce factor costs, to diversify the economic and export base, and to improve the business
environment; these are key to stemming the erosion of competitiveness, boosting exports, and
reducing external imbalances (¶¶20–21; 29–30). The authorities pointed out and the staff
agreed that in addition to much needed strengthening of fiscal policy and implementation of
reforms under Fund-supported programs, debt relief would be critical in helping restore

2

With the support of the EU, a PEFA assessment mission identified in September 2007 a number of weaknesses
in the country’s public financial management (PFM) system. A final PEFA report was issued in February 2008.

3

Pending confirmation of related data by the audit, the fiscal program and DSA update currently exclude
outlays for these arrears.

4

In 1979 the Comoros signed a monetary cooperation agreement with France, making the country part of the
Franc Zone, but with its own currency and central bank, rather than using the CFA franc and regional bank. In
1994, the Comorian Franc devalued by 33 percent in foreign currency terms, compared with the CFA franc
devaluation of 50 percent.

15
external viability over the medium to long term. Comoros faces indeed a current account
disequilibrium giving rise to an unstable external position prior to the receipt of debt relief.

Box 4. Comoros: Actual and Equilibrium Real Effective Exchange Rate
The mission shared with the authorities the results of a preliminary assessment of Comoros’ competitiveness, which
indicates that while the real effective exchange rate was broadly in line with economic fundamentals at end-2007,
Comoros fares poorly on structural competitiveness grounds compared to other low-income small states in the
region.1

•

Equilibrium Exchange Rate (REER) estimates were obtained using an Autoregressive Lag Modeling (ARDL)
approach for the period 1980-2007, with the following set of fundamentals (i) terms of trade (TOT),
(ii) economic openness (OPEN), (iii) total factor productivity (FTP) proxied by real per capita GDP, and
(iv) government consumption (GOV). All variables exhibited the expected sign, but only the terms of trade
variable was statistically significant.

ln( REER) = 0.24 ln(TOT )+ 0.08 ln(OPEN )+ 1.77 ln(TFP)− 0.28 ln(GOV )
[ 3.18]

[ 0.11]

[ 0.85 ]

[ 0.82 ]

•

The 2009 World Bank Doing Business Report suggests that Comoros ranks low (155 out of 181) in the quality
of the business environment, with one of the highest cost of trading cross border in the SSA region.

•

The external sustainability approach yields an average current account deficit norm of about 3 percent of
GDP, compared with an outturn of 6.7 percent of GDP in 2007. Available REER-elasticities of the current
account for Comoros suggest that closing the gap would require a REER adjustment of 6 percent—a rough
estimate of rather limited exchange rate misalignment. This result should be interpreted with caution, as the
choice of the benchmark level for net foreign assets is arbitrary to some extent.
Text Figure 4. Actual and Equilbrium Exchange Rate: 1995–2007

At end-2007, REER is broadly in line with fundamentals. As external and internal
imbalances have widened in recent years, the actual REER has appreciated.

Monetary policy and financial sector developments

16.
Monetary Policy. Conducted within the Franc Zone framework, monetary policy
remains mostly passive. The authorities stressed that it will remain prudent and geared to
ensuring price stability and preservation of a sustainable external position.
17.
Enhancing financial
intermediation is critical to fostering
private sector development and
supporting growth. The authorities
noted that progress was being made to
that end, pointing to the recent
establishment of two new foreign banks:
the EXIMBANK of Tanzania and the
BFC (Banque Fédérale des Comores).
They concurred, however, that many
challenges lay ahead, which must be
addressed to ensure that expanded
financial intermediation is effective in
fostering growth over the medium term.
They stressed the need to strengthen
bank supervision and licensing, and to
improve micro finance institutions
(MFIs) regulation. To address
weaknesses in these areas, the
authorities have (i) asked for IMF
technical assistance in bank supervision
and (ii) initiated negotiations with the
central banks of Madagascar and
Tanzania, aimed at securing technical
support in critical bank supervision
functions.

Staff discussed the oversight of MFIs, and the full integration of these
institutions into the supervisory network to ensure adequate inspections and
monitoring of prudential indicators. It reviewed the status of implementation of the 2007
safeguards assessment recommendations; actions already carried out include: (i) joint FrenchComoros government approval of new statutes for the Central Bank of Comoros (BCC) and
(ii) completion of the audit of BCC operations for FY 2007. Staff also explained that EPCA
would require an update assessment to be completed prior to the approval of a subsequent
PRGF arrangement, and stressed the critical importance of ensuring full implementation of
all outstanding 2007 safeguards recommendations by that time.

19
D. Promoting Structural Reforms to Improve the Investment Climate

19.
The mission reviewed key structural constraints to external competitiveness,
which have hampered export growth and diversification (Text Tables 2 and 3). The authorities
indicated that measures to address these would feature prominently in the reform agenda
under a future PRGF arrangement—with a focus on state-owned enterprises (SOEs), business
licensing requirements, investors’ protection, and the legal system. They are already seeking
World Bank/IFC assistance in developing a reform strategy for the petroleum-importing,
telecommunications, and electricity parastatals; and have introduced critical price and
structural measures to begin addressing widespread distortions in the energy sector (para. 27
below).

Trade reform and FDI

20.
The authorities concurred that enhanced international trade and foreign direct
investment (FDI) would facilitate economic diversification and boost growth. In
discussing recommendations from the recently concluded Diagnostic Trade Integration Study
(DTIS), they underscored the need to develop Comoros’ significant tourism potential by
attracting FDI into the sector. Inward FDI could increase from an annual average of
0.4 percent of GDP during 2000–07 to about 2 percent of GDP over the medium term, fuelled
mainly by tourism investments from the Gulf States (Kuwait and the AE).

IV. THE EPCA-SUPPORTED PROGRAM AND DISBURSEMENT UNDER THE RAPID-ACCESS
EXOGENOUS SHOCKS FACILITY
A. Overview

21.
The mission reached understandings with the authorities on a set of
macroeconomic and structural policies that could be supported under an EPCA. At
present time, the EPCA is the most appropriate instrument for Fund reengagement with the
Comoros, and the country appears to have met all four eligibility criteria.
•

First, the already weak institutions and public administration have been severely
affected by a protracted political crisis and the recent armed conflict, posing
significant risk to the implementation of a comprehensive program that could be
supported by an upper credit tranche-standard arrangement (i.e., PRGF).

•

Second, the country faces an urgent balance of payments need beyond the impact of
the recent food and fuel price shock. As is the case for currency union countries, it is
difficult to disentangle the external financing gap and the fiscal financing gap for the
Comoros, a member of the Franc Zone, since any Fund financing of the former
contributes to fill the latter by the same amount. Under the circumstances, the
proposed EPCA purchase (SDR 1.1 million or 12.5 percent of quota) is to contribute
to meeting balance of payments financing needs equivalent to a residual fiscal gap
estimated at 2.4 percent of GDP for 2008.

•

Third, sufficient capacity exists for minimum policy planning and implementation.

•

Finally, concerted international support for Comoros has emerged, including
assistance from the World Bank, the African Development Bank, the European
Union, and France, in the context of an EPCA-supported program which is
catalyzing the assistance. Immediate resumption of donor financing is partly
contingent upon an IMF-supported macroeconomic framework and financial
assistance package being put in place.

22.
In the fiscal area, the EPCA-supported program focuses on revenue mobilization
and containing the wage bill (¶¶24–26, below).The structural agenda seeks to gradually
restore inter-island cooperation, tackle selected structural impediments to medium-term
expenditure viability, and begin addressing core economic distortions (¶¶27–29 below).
If successfully implemented, the program could count as track record toward the HIPC
decision point, thus creating conditions for longer-term donor reengagement in strengthening
the authorities’ capacity to implement macroeconomic policies.
23.
The authorities have requested IMF support under the RAC-ESF to help smooth
adjustment to a sizable terms of trade shock in 2008 resulting from higher food and fuel

21
prices in the first nine months. The shock has caused a severe weakening of the external
current account position (Table 4). When volumes are maintained at their 2007 levels, the
import bill for food and fuel rises by an estimated CF 12 billion (6.8 percent of GDP) in
2008, which is equivalent to SDR 22.9 million or 257 percent of quota. To address the shock,
the authorities have initiated critical expenditure- reducing and switching measures.
Especially noteworthy are a tightening of fiscal policy (Table 2a) and the gradual introduction
of market-based prices for key import and export commodities, including petroleum products
(¶28 below); all of which should contribute to a narrowing of the country’s external
imbalances over time. An increasing number of donors are showing readiness to assist
Comoros in this endeavor (¶26 below).
Box 5. The IMF and Comoros: Leading the Donor Reengagement Process
The last Fund financial arrangement with instability-prone Comoros, in the amount of
SDR 3.15 million, veered off track in 1994 after SDR 2.25 million had been drawn. With the gradual
return of political stability since mid-2008, the government intends to rekindle growth-supporting
reforms that had since been put on hold. In this context, the staff team that visited Moroni during
July 25–August 8, 2008, reached understandings with the government ad referendum on the
outline of a program that could be supported under the EPCA. Board consideration had however
been delayed because of difficulties in promptly securing adequate financing assurances from
donors.
In recent months, key development partners have intensified preparations for policy reengagement
with Comoros. In light of the improved financing prospects, there is merit in going ahead with the
proposed EPCA. Further delays would cause the postponement of several anticipated aid
disbursements, incurrence of more external arrears, and, even more seriously, a weakening of the
momentum for reforms. The authorities expect the Fund to play a leading role at this initial stage
of the efforts to get their reform agenda moving again.

B. Macroeconomic Policies Under the EPCA-Supported Program

24.
Against a background of low growth, the fiscal program for 2008 focuses on
restoring inter-island cooperation and initiating much needed consolidation of the
budgetary position. Last November, parliament approved a revised, Union-based, budget for
2008. The latter incorporates revenue and spending lines pertaining to the hitherto excluded
island of Anjouan (MEFP ¶11). Under the new budget, total revenue is projected to reach
12.4 percent of GDP. In a lackluster economic environment, a modest rebound in customs
revenue—despite lack of access to the port of Anjouan in the conflict-afflicted first half of the
year—is unlikely to fully offset a decline in domestic tax revenue5. Total expenditure is

5

Customs revenue performance is notably sustained by the recent introduction of ASYCUDA+++ (see
paragraph 12 above).

22
projected at 21.7 percent of GDP, with wages rising to 9 percent of GDP (8.2 percent in the
initial budget) following the integration of Anjouan in the Union budget, but also reflecting
pre-election civil service and military recruitments in mid-year. To contain the wage bill
within the budgeted envelope, the authorities have frozen civil service recruitments and
intend to reduce government ministerial portfolios from 34 to 26 (MEFP ¶14). Other non
wage recurrent expenditures are projected to increase by 0.8 percentage point of GDP; they
include one-off military and island presidential elections outlays relating to the resolution of
the Anjouan crisis. Foreign-financed capital spending on road rehabilitation is to rise by
1 percent of GDP, while domestically funded investment outlays are projected to stagnate at
0.7 percent of GDP. With support from the EU, the government settled CF 995 million in
wage arrears from FY 2007. However, faced with a tight budgetary situation, the authorities
introduced only limited and time-bound measures to address rising food and fuel prices, at a
fiscal cost of 0.14 percent of GDP in 2008 (Box 6). Also, because of the difficult cash-flow
position, the authorities have taken the following steps:
•

They have initiated discussions with the civil service trade unions on delaying to 2009
payment of an estimated one month of wages (CF 1.3 billion or 0.7 percent of GDP; Text
Table 4 and para. 25 below); and

•

Under the program, Comoros is assumed to remain current on debt service to the
World Bank and AfDB. The arrears situation (including new external arrears to official
creditors accumulated under the EPCA; see Text Table 4) will be addressed
comprehensively ahead of the expected request for a PRGF-supported program in 2009.
In this regard, the authorities have been in regular contact with their external creditors to
prepare for this normalization of relations.
Box 6. Comoros: Policy Response to Rising Food and Fuel Prices in 2008
To mitigate the impact of rising food and fuel prices on the poor, the Comorian authorities
have: (i) reduced import duty rates on wheat flower and yeast, with an estimated revenue loss of
CF 39.3 million; and (ii) provided low-priced fuel to the state-owned electricity company MAMWE to help limit the impact of the higher fuel prices on electricity tariffs, at the cost of CF
210 million. The total fiscal cost of these measures is equivalent to 0.14 percent of GDP.
The authorities concurred that international price increases are likely to be permanent and
should, over the medium term, be passed through to consumers. Staff urged introduction of
social targeted measures for the most vulnerable social groups, and encouraged the authorities to
seek donor assistance in the design of related social safety nets.

The fiscal financing needs for 2009 require stepped-up donor support. The fiscal
financing requirements for 2008 are currently estimated at $21.2 million (3.9 percent of GDP),
25.

23
for which $8.3 million in budget support has so far been identified. Taking account of
$5.3 million in combined EPCA-ESF Fund assistance, still leaves a residual financing gap of
$7.6 million (1.4 percent of GDP). As a result, some domestic and external payments are delayed
to 2009 (para. 24 and Text Table 4). In 2009, the authorities are expected to stay the course

with the revenue efforts and expenditure control measures initiated in 2008. However, in
view of the greater debt service obligations falling due, the fiscal financing requirements for
the 12 months to end-December 2009 are expected to rise to the equivalent of
US$25.1 million (4.8 percent of GDP). A donors conference in the coming months would
provide a venue for securing resources to cover a residual gap, before IMF assistance,
currently estimated at US$11.5 million (2.2 percent of GDP) for the year
(Text Table 4 below).With several key donors—including the World Bank and EU—due to
restart extending direct budget support, prospects for enlisting needed assistance appear
broadly favorable, provided the authorities stick to their adjustment program.

Most donors have expressed readiness to extend technical assistance, provided
reforms under the EPCA are adhered to and implemented satisfactorily. The mission
discussed the most urgent TA needs, with a focus on revenue and expenditure management—
where early French and World Bank involvement is expected; and on debt and data
management capacity building, two areas that are likely to be taken up by the African
Development Bank. Staff stressed the importance of donor coordination in the provision of
identified TA (Box 7).

C.

The Structural Reform Agenda under the EPCA-Supported Program

27.
The EPCA’s structural agenda focuses on issues pertaining to inter-island
cooperation, structural impediments to medium-term expenditure viability, and core
economic distortions. After reestablishing the revenue-sharing mechanism and securing
parliamentary approval of a supplementary budget for 2008 that integrates the island of
Anjouan and is consistent with the macroeconomic framework under the proposed EPCA
(two prior actions), the authorities will implement the following measures as structural
benchmarks: (i) issuance of quarterly Union-based fiscal accounts, starting December 1, 2008;
(ii) full computerization of the civil service wage payments before December 1, 2008;
and (iii) recruitment, before January 31, 2009, of a firm to audit domestic payment arrears
and prepare an arrears clearance strategy.
The authorities are upwardly revising petroleum products prices and electricity
28.
tariffs—which have been frozen since 2005 and 1994, respectively. They raised retail prices
for gasoline and gas oil by an average of 18 percent in early August, and adjusted electricity
tariffs in mid-October. Going forward, they intend to seek World Bank assistance in
assessing the financial health of state-owned enterprises to inform a reform strategy for the
sector. Authorities also plan to dismantle the loss-making state-owned rice import monopoly
(MEFP ¶25), and are expected to complete the final PRSP before end-March 2009.
Other structural reforms are aimed at enhancing the efficiency of public
29.
administration. These include the adoption of organic frameworks that set the appropriate
structure and optimal level of staffing for the civil service (MEFP ¶¶23–24). Once the organic
frameworks are in place, the authorities intend to discuss with World Bank staff a

25
comprehensive civil service reform to improve public service delivery while reducing
staffing to levels compatible with medium-term budget viability.
D.

EPCA and ESF Access, Capacity to Repay the Fund, and Program Monitoring

30.
The proposed EPCA and ESF access levels are equivalent to 12.5 percent of
quota (SDR 1.1 million or about US$ 1.7 million) and 25 percent of quota (SDR 2.2 million
or about US$3.4 million), respectively. The disbursements are to be made in full upon
Board approval of the program, for the period October 2008–March 2009. Over the program
period (2008–09), debt service to the Fund would average 0.1 percent of exports of goods and
services—after assumed EPCA subsidies and subject to availability of subsidy resources
(Table 6). Depending on progress made during the period, staff would assess the possibility
of moving to a PRGF arrangement. If progress is not deemed sufficient to that end, the
authorities would likely request a second purchase of EPCA, with Board approval. With the
proposed first EPCA purchase and ESF disbursement, Comoros’s credit outstanding to the
Fund would increase from nil to 37.5 percent of quota.
31.
All prior actions for approval of the EPCA have been met (MEFP, paragraph 34)
and program monitoring will be effected through several quantitative and
structural indicators (MEFP, Tables 1 and 2). Especially noteworthy are the full
restoration of the Revenue Sharing Agreement (RSA) and parliamentary approval of the
revised budget for 2008.
The risk to Fund resources is considered low as Comoros, a member of the
32.
Franc zone, has had an excellent record of honoring its past debt service obligations to the
IMF.
V. PRSP AND OTHER ISSUES

33.
The full PRSP is expected to be completed by end-March 2009. Comoros’ Interim
PRSP (I-PRSP, 2006–09) was considered by the Boards of the IMF and World Bank in May
2006.6 Following a long period of political crisis and limited donor support, the authorities
intend to finalize the full PRSP by end-March 2009. Staff urged prioritization of envisaged
PRSP reform measures across strategic axes and sectors, with due consideration given to
capacity constraints and anticipated external assistance.
The mission discussed the quality and availability of key statistical data for
34.
program monitoring and surveillance purposes. The coverage of fiscal data is being
extended to include all Union and islands budgetary operations; data reporting in standard
tables of government financial operations needs strengthening. Staff discussed preparation of
the authorities’ data management modernization program; a donor supported comprehensive
6

Country Report No. 06/191 and Country Report No. 06/192.

26
review, most notably for fiscal and balance of payment statistics, will serve as a basis for
setting up a medium-term action plan for data collection, treatment and distribution. In this
context, a STA mission has been fielded to provide TA to the BCC on monetary data
treatment methodologies.
35.
The mission met with members of the donor community and representatives of
trade unions and NGOs. It spelled out proposed Fund’s involvement in efforts to boost
economic growth and reduce poverty in Comoros, and sought civil society’s views on IMF
policy dialogue with the government. Staff issued a concluding statement at the end of the
mission.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL

36.
Following a long period of instability, the Union of the Comoros is painstakingly
making its way toward national reconciliation and economic normalcy. The new political
context provides a window of opportunity for the authorities to rekindle economic activity
and enhance the effectiveness of their poverty reduction strategy. To reinvigorate growth, the
authorities are keen on implementing growth-supporting reforms with donor assistance,
starting with an EPCA for the 6-month period to end-March 2009. In the fiscal area, the
program is appropriately focused on revenue mobilization and containing the wage bill; and
its structural agenda would seek to gradually restore inter-island cooperation, tackle selected
structural impediments to medium-term expenditure viability, and begin addressing core
economic distortions. Staff commends the authorities for steadfast implementation of all
agreed prior actions and strongly urges them to ensure successful implementation of the
EPCA-supported program. This would open the way to comprehensive reforms and donor
support under the PRGF, and to much needed debt relief under the HIPC and MDRI.
The authorities recognize that putting the economy on a path of strong and
37.
sustainable growth requires preservation of macroeconomic stability over the medium
term and, in particular, of budgetary discipline. It therefore is of utmost importance that
the 2008 fiscal targets be observed. This would provide confidence to donors and to the
private sector regarding the government’s determination to put the budget on a sustainable
path. In this context, staff welcomes recent measures to improve customs and tax
administration, including the introduction of ASYCUDA ++, a freeze on civil service
recruitments, and the streamlining of government ministerial portfolios. In the period ahead,
close monitoring of personnel expenditures, the single most important item in the budget,
will remain a critical ingredient of macrobudgetary stability; the authorities will need
to intensify program reforms in this area.
The exchange rate peg under the Franc Zone arrangement will remain an
38.
important anchor for macroeconomic stability, and there is no evidence that the real
exchange rate is misaligned. However, sustained real appreciation of the Comoros franc
in recent years underscores the need for structural reforms to stem the erosion of
competitiveness and promote private sector development. Staff welcomes the reform of the

27
Central Bank’s statutes that strengthens the bank’s independence and should help minimize
the impact on monetary developments of a still fragile fiscal situation. Staff encourages the
BCC to ensure full implementation of the recommendations of the 2007 safeguards
assessment, and to provide Fund staff with all information requested to complete the update
assessment required in connection with EPCA.
39.
The authorities should be commended for steps taken to begin addressing
entrenched structural impediments to growth. Last August and November, the
government upwardly revised petroleum products prices and electricity tariffs—which had
been frozen since 2005 and 1994, respectively. Staff urges the authorities to forge ahead with
establishing a flexible-pricing mechanism for these utilities, with donor technical assistance.
This is critical to making power supply more reliable, and to preventing a repeat of the severe
energy shortages experienced in July. Staff also encourages the government to accelerate
preparations for reforms of state-owned enterprises, and to secure needed World Bank
support at an early date. Staff urges the authorities to ensure timely completion of the final
PRSP, which will provide more focus to their reform agenda going forward.
Comoros’ reform ambitions face major risks, including uncertain energy prospects
40.
and negative terms of trade shocks. Further, a reemergence of domestic socio-political
instability, as well as weak implementation capacity, could undermine implementation of the
reform agenda. However, the recent progress in strengthening democracy with support from
the African Union and other key bilateral partners, and better coordinated capacity building
support by development partners, are expected to mitigate program risks.
In view of government commitment to agreed program reforms and steadfast
41.
implementation of related prior-actions, the staff recommends Board approval of the
authorities’ request for assistance under the EPCA and ESF. With respect to the latter,
the staff welcomes early phase-in of market based prices of key traded products combined
with fiscal restraint. Delays in putting the program in place would lead to further
postponement of aid disbursements, the incurrence of more external and domestic payment
arrears, and a weakening of the momentum for reforms.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Comoros be held on the
42.
standard 12-month cycle.

APPENDIX I
UNION OF THE COMOROS: LETTER OF INTENT
November 26, 2008
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington D.C. 20431
U.S.A.
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
1.
Our long and difficult process of national reconciliation is now getting back on
track, following the most recent political crisis in the island of Anjouan. Economic and social
conditions have worsened in the post-conflict period; the country’s administrative capacity
was severely weakened. The fiscal situation has tightened and relations with the international
community have suffered. A new island President for the island of Anjouan was elected last
June and his administration is fully functioning as an integral part of the Union of Comoros.
The Union together with the three island governments has taken early steps to restore interisland cooperation and reactivate the revenue sharing agreement. There are already
encouraging signs of an improvement in national cohesiveness, and donor support is
expected to resume.
In order to build on these recent gains, the government has agreed on a program of
2.
economic and financial policies that begins to address the immediate post-conflict challenges
of stabilizing the fiscal position, building capacity for policy implementation, and
normalizing relations with the donor community. The program also includes structural
measures that lay the ground work for meeting the country’s medium-term objectives of
reviving growth, reducing poverty, and achieving fiscal and external sustainability. Many
donors have already indicated they will provide critical financial and technical support for
program management. In order to facilitate implementation of planned measures under the
program, address our balance of payments needs and restore confidence in economic
management, the government is requesting SDR 1.1125 million (12.5 percent of quota) under
the Fund’s Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance (EPCA) and SDR 2.225 million (25 percent
of quota) under the Rapid-Access Component of the Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF).
A critical factor underlying our program is the firm commitment by the Union and the
3.
three island governments to implement the agreed inter-island revenue sharing agreement.
The details of the program are included in the attached Memorandum on Economic and

37
Financial Policies (MEFP). The government believes that the policies and measures set forth
in the MEFP are adequate for achieving the objectives of the program, but we will take any
further measures that may become appropriate for that purpose. In such cases, as well as
before implementing policies that could adversely affect the program, we will consult the
Fund.
To assist the Fund in assessing progress on the program, we will provide information
4.
on a regular basis as detailed in the attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding.
Moreover, we invite the staff of the Fund to review performance under the program quarterly,
on the basis of quantitative and structural indicators (Tables 1 and 2 of the MEFP) as well as
on overall implementation of the program. We consent to the publication of both the staff
report and memorandum on economic and financial policies pertaining to the discussions
under the 2008 Article IV consultation and EPCA- and ESF-supported program discussions.
Going forward, we plan to deepen our reform agenda after the EPCA-supported
5.
program is completed. In this context, we intend to seek in due course IMF assistance under
the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility.
Sincerely yours,

ATTACHMENT I
UNION OF THE COMOROS: MEMORANDUM ON ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL
POLICIES FOR 2008–09
I. INTRODUCTION

1.
Comoros is slowly recovering from the most recent political crisis. Decades of
political instability have taken a significant toll: per capita real GDP has declined; basic
social services have suffered and administrative capacity has weakened considerably. Almost
half of the population lives below the poverty line, and there is limited access to clean water
and electricity, and to services such as education and health care. The situation worsened over
the last year due to internal strife and lack of donor assistance.
Major efforts since March of this year have helped to reunify the country, restart
2.
political reconciliation and begin the process of restoring institutions. The forced removal of
the former Anjouan island rebel leader, Colonel Bakar, followed by the election of a new
island president in June set the stage for bringing Anjouan back into the fold of the Union,
resuming inter-island cooperation, and gradually rebuilding economic and social management
institutions at the national level, including the revenue-sharing agreement initially put in
place in 20051. The government intends to further advance the national reconciliation process
by effectively implementing laws devolving to the island administrations significant authority
for domestic security, the judiciary, health, and education, and oversight of public sector
enterprises.
The Union government, firmly backed by its island partners, is determined to pursue
3.
prudent economic and financial policies to begin putting the economy on a path of strong and
sustainable growth for more effective poverty alleviation. With IMF assistance, an economic
reform program has been prepared for the six-month period October 2008 to March 2009,
aimed at strengthening institutions and governance, beginning to restore macroeconomic
stability, and improving the investment climate. In support of these reforms, the government
has requested IMF Emergency Post Conflict Assistance (EPCA), a bridge to a possible
support under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) and debt relief under the
enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI).

1

Under the revenue sharing agreement, the customs and tax authorities transfer revenues designated for
distribution to a single special account at the central bank. Under the 2006 framework fixed percentages are set
aside for external debt service (20.1 percent), and pension payments (5.5 percent). The remainder is shared as
follows: Union (37.5 percent), Ngazidja (27.4 percent), Anjouan (25.7 percent) and Moheli (9.4 percent).
However, beginning with the 2007 budget, provisions for external debt service are based on obligations actually
falling due.

39
II. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN 2007

4.
Real GDP growth was a mere 0.5 percent in 2007, mainly reflecting the political
crisis in Anjouan and the curtailment of domestic credit by the sole commercial bank
following a disputed lawsuit. Both events have hampered business activities and reduced the
volume of imports by 19 percent. The agricultural sector has been sustained only by a
relatively good food harvest. Inflation stood at 4.6 percent ay year-end, driven by higher food
prices and by the impact of rising oil prices. Broad money increased modestly by 1.1 percent,
with declining domestic credit offsetting gains in net foreign assets.
Against a background of a destabilizing political crisis and economic decline, fiscal
5.
performance deteriorated. The 2007 budget targets were missed with the domestic primary
deficit increasing to 2.2 percent of GDP against a budgeted surplus of 1.5 percent. Revenues
were down by 3.9 percent of GDP against budget, reflecting poor economic activity in
general, as well as weaknesses in fiscal administration in the face of political instability and
the breakdown in the inter-island revenue sharing mechanism. The wage bill was well above
the budgeted ceiling, mainly due to staffing increases in the run up to last year’s presidential
elections on the islands of Moheli and Ngazidja. Additional budget financing was secured
from the central bank, donors, and short-term non-bank sources; nevertheless domestic
arrears increased to 1.8 percent of GDP.
In 2007, the external current account deficit narrowed by 2.2 percentage-points of
6.
GDP, reflecting deterioration in the terms of trade and a surge in energy and food import
values, despite strong inflows of remittances and a quite reasonable export performance. Endyear official reserves amounted to over 7 months of import cover. Understandings on arrears
clearance were reached with key multilateral creditors, in particular BADEA, IFAD, and the
Arab Monetary Fund. The government also started debt discussions with the European
Investment Bank (EIB), the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) and OPEC. The African
Development Bank (AfDB) approved an arrears clearance operation in December 2007,
canceling $34.5 million in external debt arrears. However, Comoros’ external debt burden
remains unsustainable. The NPV of debt to exports ratio is estimated at over 249 percent in
2007, above the HIPC threshold. Remaining current on obligations stemming from recent
external arrears clearance agreements represents a substantial drain on public finances,
particularly in the absence of debt relief under the HIPC and MDRI initiatives. As a result,
new arrears were accumulated at the end of 2007 amounting to 0.4 percent of GDP, of which
0.2 percent of GDP was owed to BADEA, EIB and IsDB.
Progress on structural reforms was held back by the political crisis. Nevertheless, a
7.
new investment code has been adopted, and some progress made toward liberalizing the
telecommunication sector. Amendments to strengthen the central bank charter have been
approved by both the French and Comoros finance ministries, and are awaiting parliamentary
approval in both countries; at the same time progress has been made on implementing the

40
recommendations of the IMF’s Safeguards Assessment and on strengthening supervision of
microfinance institutions.
III. OUTLOOK, OBJECTIVES AND ECONOMIC POLICIES FOR 2008 AND THE MEDIUM TERM
A. Macroeconomic Framework for 2008

8.
Economic developments in the first half of 2008 were dominated by a serious energy
crisis and restrictions on credit to the private sector, at a time of particularly high seasonal
economic activity driven by the visiting diaspora.
Despite a significant increase in international oil prices, the freeze on retail prices of
9.
petroleum products since 2005 and on electricity tariffs for the past 20 years was still in effect
at end-June 2008. Moreover, a permanent government contract for importing petroleum
products, which expired in April, was not been renewed, as a result of which the state-owned
oil and gas (SCH) and electric (MAMWE) companies are beset by ever-increasing operating
losses. Widespread power outages were suffered in mid-year and only 20 percent of annual
oil imports are expected to be effected in the second half of 2008. Aware of the negative
repercussions of this situation for economic activity, the government has started upwardly
adjusting petroleum products prices, consistent with developments in underlying cost
parameters. To that end, prices of key petroleum products were increased by 18 percent on
average in August. Going forward, these prices will be revised on a quarterly basis, beginning
in November 2008, to take account of changes in relevant cost parameters. In the financial
sector, the Comoros’ single commercial bank (Banque de l’Industrie et du Commerce)
resumed normal activities in late September, following resolution of a lawsuit by a private
sector economic operator. This should ease access to credit for the private sector, further
facilitated by the recent opening of a new commercial credit institution (EXIMBANK of
Tanzania).
10.
Against this backdrop, the objectives of the government’s economic program are
based on a real GDP growth rate of 0.5 percent for 2008, underpinned mainly by activity in
the agricultural sector; end-year inflation of 9.6 percent; and a current account deficit
(including grants) of 8.7 percent of GDP. International reserves would be maintained around
6 months of imports of goods and nonfactor services.

41
B. Fiscal Policy

11.
In the fiscal area, the program will focus on restoring inter-island cooperation and
initiating fiscal consolidation. To that end, the 2008 budget of the Union, which was initially
approved by parliament in February of 2008, has been amended and approved by the National
Assembly last November to include Anjouan and to consolidate the framework of the
revenue sharing mechanism. The budget anticipates a domestic primary deficit of 2.7 percent
of GDP, and a nearly balanced overall budget position (on a cash basis, including grants).
This takes account of delayed payments for wages (9 tenths of one month) and for debt
service to selected external creditors, owing to the government’s tight budgetary situation.
The government has initiated discussions with concerned domestic and external creditors,
including France, aimed at developing agreed modalities for an early settlement of the
overdue payments; it is committed to remaining current on debt service to the World Bank
and African Development Bank. On the basis of the above, the fiscal financing requirements
for 2008 are estimated at CF 7.1 billion ($21.2 million or 3.9 percent of GDP). In addition to
IMF support under the EPCA and ESF, external assistance under the program comprises
budget support earmarked for wage and wage arrears payments—from the EU and France,
food aid from the AfDB, and general budget support from Kuwait. Should additional external
budget assistance become available, the government will consult with the Fund on its use and
issue a further supplementary budget outlining how the resources are to be spent.
12.
Strict implementation of the inter-island revenue-sharing agreement and better
expenditure management should result in a more predictable cash flow that will facilitate the
timely payment of domestic obligations, and help avoid the accumulation of new domestic
arrears. In this context the government will curtail its use of the three-month bridge financing
arrangement with the National Financial and Postal Services Company (SNPSF) to ensure
timely payment of civil service salaries. It also intends to start repayment of the advances
received from the SNPSF (CF 833 million at end-July 2008), the total of which is to be
reduced by CF 238 million in net terms in 2008.
Domestic revenues are projected at CF 22,301 billion (12.4 percent of GDP),
13.
5 percent higher than the revenue collected in 2007. This largely reflects efficiency gains in
tax and customs administration and other recent measures to improve revenue collection. The
customs department (i) implemented the ASYCUDA++ system in the islands of Ngazidja and
Anjouan and intends to extend it to all customs agencies nationwide; (ii) established an
exemptions control commission tasked with reducing exemptions by 40 percent from their
2007 level, in strict observance of the pertinent Vienna Convention; and (iii) took steps to
remove the presumptive tax on containers from October 1, 2008, under the 2008
supplementary budget. In addition, a single taxpayer identification number system (NIF) was
established and, after taking a census of large taxpayers, the General Directorate of Taxes
(DGI) has refocused the activities of the Corporate Tax Unit to the exclusive monitoring the
large taxpayers’ fiscal obligations. The government plans to increase the unit’s operating

42
budget, while the DGI works to complete implementation of the SYSIT system (aimed at
enhancing tax compliance and collection). Finally, a customs-tax mixed commission was
created to ensure better collaboration between the two administrations.
Total expenditures are estimated at CF 38,978 billion or 21.7 percent of GDP. The
14.
authorities are determined to slow the rapid growth in primary spending experienced in recent
years to a level compatible with available resources. Accordingly, the government has
(i) placed a freeze on new hiring in the civil service starting August 8, 2008; (ii) reduced the
number of Union and island ministerial portfolios from 35 to 26 by end-November 2008; and
(iii) launched the computerization of wage payments. Consequently, current primary
expenditure will be limited to 14.4 percent of GDP, including 9 percent of GDP in wage
payments, and capital spending financed with domestic resources will be contained at
0.7 percent of GDP. To ensure greater control of spending on goods and services, the
government has decreed a freeze on non essential overseas missions.
Faced with a difficult budgetary situation, the government has taken only very limited
15.
fiscal measures to cushion the impact on consumers of higher food and oil prices. Customs
tariffs on flour imports have been temporarily reduced and the government has made
petroleum products available to the national electric company (MAMWE) at reduced prices.
The fiscal cost of these measures is estimated at CF 249.3 million (0.14 percent of GDP) in
the 2008 budget. The government recognizes that measures to protect the poor must be well
targeted and relative price distortions avoided. In the medium term, adjustment requires price
increases as needed to continue the recent trend towards revival of agricultural production.
In 2009, the government intends to intensify the revenue efforts and expenditure
16.
control measures initiated in 2008. As a result, the domestic primary budget deficit is
projected to decline to 1.6 percent of GDP (2.7 percent in 2008). However, in view of greater
debt service obligations falling due, the fiscal financing requirements for 2009 are expected
to rise to the equivalent of US$25.1 million (4.8 percent of GDP). The government plans to
organize a donors conference in the coming months to seek financing assurances to cover a
residual gap currently estimated at the equivalent of $11.5 million (2.2 percent of GDP).
The government will complete an audit of domestic payment arrears, including an
17.
arrears clearance strategy, with donor assistance by end-June 2009. To that end, it began
discussions with the World Bank last October 2008 and will hire the services of a consultant
by January 31, 2009. In addition to government debt to private enterprises, the audit will
cover cross-financial obligations between the Treasury and public enterprises.

43
C. Monetary Policy and Financial Sector Reforms

18.
Broad money is projected to increase by 7.1 percent, with credit to the private sector
remaining stagnant. Monetary policy will continue to be circumscribed by the Comoros’
participation in the franc zone, which has enabled the government to contain inflation, and
maintain a stable exchange rate and an adequate level of foreign reserves despite major fiscal
imbalances.
The government is determined to ensure the independence of the central bank in
19.
monetary and credit policy. This is necessary to ensure macroeconomic stability and support
the exchange rate regime in a more competitive banking environment seeking to achieve
market-based interest rates.
The central bank will continue efforts to enhance the effectiveness of the financial
20.
system and to strengthen bank supervision. To encourage competition, it has granted licenses
for the opening of two new foreign commercial banks specializing in financing the
productive sectors. The BCC will endeavor to contain the potential risks that could arise with
the operation of these new foreign banks by strengthening the modalities of cooperation with
the banks’ home country supervisors. A memorandum of understanding with these home
country supervisors will be finalized by end-December 2008. In keeping with the decree of
July 2004 authorizing BCC supervision of microfinance institutions (MFIs), the central bank
will reinforce the supervision program for these institutions, which have experienced rapid
growth in recent years.2 The National Financial and Postal Services Company (SNPSF) will
take steps to limit credit risks notably pertaining to its lending to public enterprises and to the
Treasury; it will endeavor to extend the new postal checking service to a larger public.
To combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism, a law was adopted in
21.
2004 to implement the rules derived from the United Nations conventions and resolutions
and the 40 FATF recommendations. Updated consistent with new FATF recommendations,
the legislation is under review, and awaits approval, by the government. The government
intends to involve the autonomous islands in its implementation. The government, in
consultation with the central bank and the autonomous islands, will endeavor to terminate the
operations of the offshore banking centers.
22.
To provide reasonable assurance that the central bank’s legal structure, its control,
accounting, reporting and auditing systems are adequate to manage resources, including IMF
disbursements, the government has accepted key recommendations of the Safeguards
2

By the end of their first year of operations in 1997, the two MFI networks had created 39 funds on the different
islands, collected more than CF 360 million in savings, and distributed CF 320 million in loans. By end-2005,
they had reached a membership base of 54,480 and a network of 83 units on the three islands, and currently they
have a market share of 31 percent of deposits and credit.

44
Assessment undertaken by the IMF Finance Department in 2007. The priority
recommendations of this assessment are being implemented in line with the timeframe
proposed in the assessment. In that connection, an audit committee was established and
audited the 2007 accounts of the BCC. The government is also aware of the need to conduct
an update safeguards assessment of the BCC in connection with EPCA and will provide all
necessary support and information to facilitate completion of the update assessment prior to
the IMF Executive Board consideration of a subsequent financial arrangement.
D. Structural Reform Agenda
Strengthening institutions and public expenditure management

23.
As underscored above, the objectives of the fiscal program can only be achieved
through strict adherence to the revenue-sharing mechanism. To this end, the governments of
the Union and the autonomous islands have fully restored inter-island cooperation and
strengthened accountability in public financial management. To improve efficiency, the
parties have also agreed to centralize certain government functions, including revenue
administration, monitoring of budget execution, and compilation of economic statistics.
Implementation of the revenue-sharing mechanism will be monitored by the operation of
inter-government committees and administrative units charged with data compilation and
dissemination, as well as policy coordination. A unit has been established to consolidate
fiscal data from the Union and island governments. In this context, the monthly meetings of
the Budgetary Committee, made up of representatives from the Union and the three islands,
will be strictly adhered to. Budget execution reports will also be prepared on a monthly basis
and disseminated to the executive branches of the Union and the three island governments.
Civil service reform

24.
The government is determined to significantly improve management of the wage bill.
Reform of the public administration (initiated under the Appui Pour une Administration
Publique Performante—APP—project funded by UNDP) is critical to that effect. It will
notably consist of efforts to computerize the civil service payment roster and implement a
computer-based and integrated system of payroll management. Other critical elements of the
civil service reform include the adoption of organic frameworks which will help set the
appropriate structure and optimal level of staffing for the civil service. A unit responsible for
monitoring wage payments has been set up and its director appointed.
25.
Implementation of the civil service reform program is being coordinated by the High
Authority for Public Administration (HA-PA), which started operations in early 2007. HAPA’s responsibilities include preparation of the institutional and legal framework for the
reforms within the public administration, coordination of all public entities, and effective
surveillance of the Union-wide application of administrative and financial management

45
procedures. During 2008, the authority will propose for adoption by the Union and Island
parliaments the envisaged organic frameworks for all ministries, which establish their
structure and staffing levels. Such frameworks will be used in the preparation of the
consolidated budgetary framework for the 2008 and subsequent budget laws.
Strengthening the investment climate

The government is determined to take steps to rehabilitate management of public
26.
enterprises—Société Comorienne des Hydrocarbures (SCH), the electricity (MAMWE) and
telecommunication (Comores Telecom) companies. These must provide reliable service in
order to attract investors, which is a critical condition for revitalizing economic activity. The
liabilities of these units are a potential burden for the government budget. The government
plans to engage the services of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to assist in
developing a coherent reform strategy for these enterprises. The government also plans to
allow private sector participation in the importation of rice. The government also commits
not to interfere in the price setting and marketing mechanisms for export crops: vanilla,
cloves and ylang-ylang.
The government is determined to resolve the energy crisis, which threatens
27.
sustainable economic recovery. With technical assistance from donors, the government plans
to introduce a permanent flexible mechanism for setting petroleum product prices, which
would be reviewed on a quarterly basis, starting in November 2008, to reflect changes in
international prices for oil products. In the meantime, as indicated above, it has already
applied initial price increases for petroleum products and electricity rates, in an effort to
begin reducing the operating losses of the concerned public utilities. This is critical for
guaranteeing the steady availability of energy products and ensuring that needed adjustments
are effected in the face increasing international energy costs. Lastly, the government will
ensure that an agreement is signed with a firm of international repute to guarantee continuing
availability of petroleum products.
Improvements in the investment climate will be needed to attract foreign investment
28.
and encourage a shift in the use of large remittances from consumption to growth-oriented
investment. To support this, a draft Investment Code was approved by the parliament in
2007. The government will introduce a one-stop shop for investors and set up the National
Investment Promotion Agency (ANPI) by end-December 2008.
The government is committed to trade liberalization. High specific import duties on
29.
key commodities have been converted into domestic excise taxes, and ad valorem tariff rates
reduced to a new maximum of 20 percent. The government intends to pursue efforts aimed at
simplifying and further reducing import duties in the context of the Comoros’ adherence to
the regional free trade area (COMESA). These efforts will focus on eliminating exemptions
and the presumptive regime for imported multiple cargo containers. The recently concluded
diagnostic trade integration study (DTIS) under the Integrated Framework Initiative has

46
assessed the overall competitiveness of the economy, identified sectors for greatest export
potential and outlined constraints to trade development. The DTIS recommendations will be
used to guide further reforms beyond our program horizon. By end-December 2008, the
government will request IMF assistance in evaluating the effectiveness of its tax system, with
a view to preparing a program of simplification and reform that would provide an incentive to
private investment.
The government is committed to an extensive program to promote good governance,
30.
including civil service reform, judicial reform and increased transparency. The government
will review and reform its public procurement procedures with a view to making them fully
transparent and open to competition. Following the adoption by the National Assembly of the
organic laws on the justice system, the Supreme Court, and the status of magistrates, the
government will launch, starting in 2009, extensive reforms of the judiciary, and strengthen
the powers of the courts. The government has requested the support of its development
partners, including France and the UNDP, to help in the implementation of the action plan for
justice aimed at improving the quality of the judicial system.
E. External Debt Relief and Management

31.
The government is committed to regularizing its external debt situation and
improving external debt management. In 2007, it signed agreements on the treatment of
arrears owed to its multilateral and bilateral creditors. It is committed to closely working with
concerned creditors in developing mutually agreed modalities for dealing with related debt
service obligations as they fall due, pending implementation of a comprehensive IMFsupported program and Comoros’ subsequent eligibility for debt relief under the enhanced
HIPC Initiative.
The government will pursue a prudent debt management policy. Any government or
32.
government-guaranteed external borrowing will be subject to prior approval by the Finance
Minister of the Union, and the autonomous island governments may under no circumstances
contract or guarantee external loans. Moreover, for the full duration of the program, the
government will not contract or guarantee any nonconcessional or short-term external debt,
as defined in the Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU). The government is
committed to avoiding any accumulation of new external arrears in 2009; it will consult
closely with the IMF staff regarding any external debt contracted or guaranteed on
concessional terms in excess of US$20 million.
F. Statistics

33.
The Comoros’ socio-demographic and macroeconomic data bases remain weak. With
technical and financial support from the World Bank, the government has developed a
National Strategy for the Development of Statistics (SNDS), which was approved in

47
December 2007. The strategy aims to develop and adopt a legal and regulatory framework
(statistical law) for managing the country’s socio-demographic statistics. The government
aims in particular to enhance its human capacity in this area by providing training to senior
and middle-level executives in charge of the development of an integrated national account
data system with the installation of ERETES software, with a view to ensuring an adequate
monitoring of household living conditions and of the incidence of poverty in the country. The
government also intends to work on improving governance and the coordination of the
national statistics system, the production of agriculture, demographic and social statistics. It
evaluates the cost of the country’s statistical program for the period 2008–12 at
CF 4.903 million. The government will soon submit a request for technical and financial
assistance to donors for the implementation of the program. Some development partners have
already expressed interest in supporting the initiative.
IV. PROGRAM MONITORING

34.
The program is to cover the period October 2008–March 2009, and would be
monitored through quarterly quantitative and structural indicators (Tables 1 and 2). IMF
Executive Board consideration of the government’s EPCA assistance request would be
conditioned on the implementation of the following prior actions: (i) approval by parliament
of the revised budget for 2008; (ii) signing by the finance ministers of the Union and the three
island entities of a memorandum of understanding on the reactivation of the revenue sharing
mechanism; and (iii) a joint decree by the finance ministers of the union and the islands
requiring the monthly transmission to the Reform Monitoring Committee (CREF) of data on
budget execution by the Union and the islands, as well as the holding of monthly meetings of
the expanded CREF, including the budget directors of the Union and the autonomous entities.
The definitions of the quantitative indicators are provided in the attached TMU.
To secure the full collaboration of the four territorial entities in program
35.
implementation, a four-party Budgetary Committee has been created to monitor the program.
The committee is made up of finance ministers from the three islands and the Union or their
deputies. At the technical level, the Treasurers-Paymasters General of the Union and their
colleagues in the entities will prepare the meetings of the Budgetary Committee, which will
monitor the operations of the special account (payments and appropriations) and ensure
transparent management and mutual agreement with respect to the redistribution of
government resources among the entities.
36.
The government will report the data necessary for program monitoring to the IMF in
accordance with the relevant Technical Memorandum of Understanding. During the program
period, the government will not (i) introduce restrictions on payments and transfers on
current international transactions or intensify any such restrictions without first consulting the
Fund, (ii) introduce or modify multiple currency practices, (iii) conclude bilateral payments
agreements not compatible with the provisions of Article VIII of the IMF’s Articles of
Agreement, or (iv) introduce restrictions on imports for balance of payments purposes.

ATTACHMENT II
UNION OF THE COMOROS: TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING

November 26, 2008
1.
This technical memorandum of understanding (TMU) defines the quantitative
indicators and structural benchmarks to monitor the implementation of the program
supported under the Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance (EPCA) in accordance with the
understandings reached between the authorities of Comoros and the staff of the IMF. It also
specifies the reporting requirements and deadlines for transmission of data to the staff of the
IMF for program monitoring purposes.
I. DEFINITION

2.
Unless otherwise specified below, “the governments” is meant to include the
government of the Union of the Comoros and the governments of the three autonomous
islands. Local Governments, the central bank, or any government-owned entity with separate
legal personality are excluded from the definition of government. The units covered under
this definition of government are consolidated for the needs of the program.
II. QUANTITATIVE INDICATORS

3.
Quantitative indicators are the following: (i) ceiling on net domestic credit to the
government (NCG); (ii) ceiling on net accumulation of domestic arrears; (iii) ceiling on new
non-concessional external debt contracted or guaranteed by state; (iv) ceiling on new shortterm external debt contracted or guaranteed by state; (v) ceiling on accumulation of external
debt service arrears; (vi) floor on the domestic primary deficit; and (vii) floor on total
domestic revenues.
A. Ceiling on Net Domestic Credit to the Government

4.
Net domestic credit to the government is defined as overall net credit extended to the
government from domestic bank and non-bank sources. Net bank credit to the government
reflects the net credit position of the government vis-à-vis the central bank, commercial
banks and the national savings bank. It is the difference between the government’s gross
indebtedness to the banking system and its claims on the banking system. Government claims
include all deposits at the central bank and commercial banks, as well as treasury cash
holdings. The government’s debt to the banking system includes central bank credit (statutory
advances as well as any long-term credit, and IMF net credit) and commercial bank credit,
and deposits at the national savings bank. Domestic non-bank financing includes changes in
the stock of treasury bills placed in the domestic market, and privatization receipts, as well as

51
any other domestic financial debt held outside the banking sector, other than arrears, that may
arise. Table 1 below provides the details.

The change in net domestic credit to the government as of the date for the quantitative
5.
indicator or benchmark is defined as the difference between the stock on the date indicated
and the stock on December 31, 2007 for the 2008 indicators, and the stock at December 31,
2008 for the 2009 indicators.
The BCC will report the provisional data on the net bank credit to the government to
6.
Fund staff on a monthly basis, with a lag of no more than 45 days after the end of each
observation period. Final data will be reported with a maximum lag of two months. The
Ministry of Finance will report on a monthly basis, any financing from non-bank sources.
B. Ceiling on Net Accumulation of Domestic Arrears

7.
New domestic payments arrears of the government are defined as any of the
following: (i) Any bill that has been received by the spending ministry from a supplier of
goods and services, delivered and verified and for which, payment has not been made within
90 days after the date the payment order (ordonnancement) was cleared; (ii) in the case of
specific contracts between the suppliers and the government, any bill received and not paid
on the due date stipulated in the contracts; (iii) tax credits confirmed by the proper authorities
after review, and not paid within 60 days from the date when the payment order was issued;
(iv) wages and salaries and any payment to a government employee that were due to be paid
in a given month but remained unpaid on the 15th day of the following month.
8.
Under the program, the government of the union and the autonomous island
governments will not accumulate any new net domestic payments arrears, except as indicated
in Table 2 of the MEFP. This quantitative indicator will be monitored on a quarterly basis

52
Reporting requirements

9.
The authorities will report to Fund staff any accumulation of domestic payments
arrears as defined above as well as the status of outstanding balances (restes à payer) of the
Treasury.
C. Ceiling on External Debt Payments Arrears

10.
External payments arrears are defined as the sum of payments due but unpaid on
outstanding external debt (for a definition of external debt, (see above ¶16) that has been
contracted or guaranteed by the government, with the exception of external payments arrears
arising from government debt being renegotiated with creditors including Paris Club
creditors.
Under the program, the government will not accumulate any external payments
11.
arrears, except as indicated in Table 2 of the MEFP. This quantitative indicator will be
monitored on a continuous basis.
Reporting requirements

12.
The government will report to Fund staff any accumulation of external payments
arrears as soon as the due date has been missed. It will provide each month with a maximum
lag of 15 days, a table showing external debt service due (after rescheduling) and paid.
D. Ceiling on the Contracting or Guaranteeing of New Non Concessional External
Debt and Short-Term Debt by the Government

13.
This Quantitative Indicator applies not only to debt as defined in Point No. 9 of the
Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt (Executive Board Decision
No. 6230–(79/140), last amended by Executive Board Decision No. 12274–(00/85), adopted
August 24, 2000, but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed by the government for
which value has not been received.
14.
year.

Short-term debt refers to external debt with a contractual maturity of less than one

The definition of debt—as specified in Point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance
15.
Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt—reads as follows: “ (a) For the purposes of this
guideline, the term “debt” will be understood to mean a current, i.e., not contingent, liability,
created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form of assets
(including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or more
payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some future point(s) in
time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the

53
contract. Debts can take a number of forms, including: (i) loans, i.e., advances of money to
the obligor by the lender made on the basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the
funds in the future (including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans, and buyers’
credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans
under which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by
repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and
official swap arrangements); (ii) suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits
the obligor to defer payments until some time after the date on which the goods are delivered
or services are provided; and (iii) leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided
which the lessee has the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are
usually shorter than the total expected service life of the property, while the lessor retains the
title to the property. For the purpose of the guideline, the debt is the present value (at the
inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the
agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair, or maintenance of the
property. (b) Under the definition of debt set out in point 9(a), arrears, penalties, and
judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual
obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not
considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.”
16.
Any external debt of which the present value, calculated with the reference interest
rates mentioned hereafter, is superior to 50 percent of the nominal value (grant element of
less than 50 percent) is considered nonconcessional, with the exception of IMF lending under
the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility, which is considered concessional even if it does
not meet the 35 percent grant element threshold. For debt with a maturity of more than
15 years, the ten-year reference market interest rate, published by the OECD, is used to
calculate the grant element. The six-month reference market rate is used for debt with shorter
maturities.
For the purposes of this Quantitative Indicator, government is understood to include
17.
the government (as defined in ¶2 above), as well as local administrations, public institutions
of an industrial and commercial nature (EPIC), public administrative institutions (EPA),
public enterprises, and government-owned or controlled independent companies (i.e. public
enterprises with financial autonomy of which the government holds at least 50 percent of the
capital).
The government as defined in ¶2 will not contract or guarantee nonconcessional or
18.
short-term external debt as defined above. These performance criteria are monitored on a
continuous basis. They do not apply to: debt rescheduling and restructuring operations. In
addition, import-related credit and pre-export financing secured on export contracts of less
than one year maturity, are excluded from the performance criteria on short-term debt.

54
Reporting requirements

19.
The government will report any new external borrowing and its terms to Fund staff as
soon as external debt is contracted or guaranteed by the government.
E. Floor on the Domestic Primary Balance

20.
The consolidated domestic primary fiscal balance (payments order basis) is calculated
as total government revenue (defined below), excluding foreign grants, less expenditure,
excluding interest payments, and foreign-financed technical assistance and investment
expenditure.
The indicative targets for the domestic primary fiscal balance are floors set at
21.
CF 4,803 million for December 31, 2008 and CF 1,062 million for Mach 31, 2009.
Reporting requirements

During the program period, data on the domestic primary fiscal balance (payment
22.
order basis) will be forwarded monthly by the Ministry of Finance and the Budget of the
Union within 30 days following the end of each month.
F. Floor on Total Domestic Revenues

23.
Total domestic revenue is defined as reported in the consolidated government
financial operations table (TOFE), and includes all tax and non-tax receipts and excludes
external grants.
The floors on total domestic revenue, cumulative from the beginning of the 2008
24.
calendar year, is set at CF 22,301 million for December 31, 2008 and CF6,441 million for
March 31, 2009.
Reporting requirements

25.
The Ministry of Finance and Budget will report to Fund staff preliminary revenue data
on a monthly basis, with a lag of no more than one month, on the basis of actual collections
as recorded in treasury accounts. Final data will be provided once the final treasury accounts
are available, but not later than two months after the reporting of preliminary data.
III. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR PROGRAM MONITORING

26.
The authorities will report to Fund staff the following information and data according
to the schedule provided, either directly (e-mail or facsimile) or by airmail. Barring any
agreement to the contrary, the data will take the form mutually agreed by the authorities and
the IMF. The fiscal data, monetary data, external debt data, the consumer price index, and

55
any information on important legislative and/or other developments will be provided not later
than one month after the date to which they pertain.

VIII. Summary of Safeguards Assessment. A safeguards assessment of the Banque
Centrale des Comores (BCC) was completed in August 2007 and found that the BCC was
taking steps to strengthen its safeguards framework and its financial statements were subject
to an external audit. The main remaining vulnerabilities concern the quality of the external
audit mechanism, the absence of a recognized accounting framework, and no publication of
audited financial statements. The assessment recommended measures to alleviate these
weaknesses.

regretted the sharp deterioration in fiscal performance in the months leading up to the
presidential elections. They noted the country’s weak institutional constraint on its growth
and stabilization prospects, expressed concern about Comoros’s lack of external
competitiveness, and stressed the need for wide-ranging structural reforms. It is proposed that
the next Article IV consultation with Comoros take place within 24 months subject to the
provisions of the decision on consultation cycles in program countries.

II. COMOROS: RELATIONS WITH THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK GROUP

Background
1.
Due to arrears accumulation, Comoros has been under sanctions with the Bank Group
since 1993. In June 2007, the Bank started its re-engagement in the country after the Board’s
approval of the Country Dialogue Note. Comoros was defined as a post-conflict country
based on the following criteria: (i) progress in restoring peace despite the on-going political
situation involving Anjouan; (ii) improved governance (progress in revenue sharing
agreement, adoption of a consolidated budget, measures to improve transparency in public
finance management and civil service reforms) ; and (iii) progress in the resettlement of
displaced population. This facilitated the Board’s approval in December 2007 of the arrears
clearance operation through the Post-Conflict Country Facility (PCCF) mechanism.
Arrears Clearance Operation
2.
As of October 31, 2007 the arrears with the Bank Group had reached UA 21.94
million, comprising UA 12.48 million owed to ADB and UA 9.47 million owed to ADF.
According to the Bank’s plan, the financing of arrears was through a tripartite burden sharing
whereby the country, the PCCF and the donors share the burden on a case-by-case basis. The
share and contribution of the three partners in the financing of the arrears was as follows:

PCCF contribution
Donors contribution
Comoros contribution
Total

Share
69.3%
29.3%
1.0%
100%

Contribution (US$ million)
23.70
10.16
0.34
34.20

3.
The Bank’s reengagement plan involved the following activities: (i) lifting of
sanctions in December 2007; (ii) resumption of Bank operations- preparation of an interim
strategy; and (iii) positive net transfer in favor of Comoros through ADF-XI to support the
country’s poverty reduction efforts. However, as of June 2008, sanctions have not yet been
lifted as the arrears clearance operation still needs to be finalized. Letters of Commitment for
contributions from some donors are still being awaited to be able to complete the arrears
clearance.

6
Strategy and Instruments for Resuming Cooperation with Comoros
4.
There is currently no valid Country Strategy Paper (CSP) for Comoros. A new
interim CSP (2008-2010) is under preparation for presentation to the Board in November
2008. The proposed pillars are in line with ADF-XI and Fragile State Facility (FSF)
priorities. The proposed lending program for 2008-2010 focus on the following areas:
(i) institutional support to the Ministry of Finance; (ii) institutional support to the private
sector through vocational training; and (iii) improving access to water and sanitation. Nonlending activities include: (i) Economic and sector Work (ESW); and (ii) country dialogue.
The lending and non-lending activities will be financed from ADF-XI and FSF resources to
the tune of UA 5 million and UA 10 million, respectively.

7

III. COMOROS: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance. The
statistical database has deficiencies in all sectors because of inadequate staffing and funding,
as well as lack of integration of island-based data. Comoros does not participate in the
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS).
National accounts data and prices
2.
Data shortcomings are particularly severe in the area of national accounts. Since basic
data are not available in a number of areas, estimates of GDP at current prices are compiled
using outdated benchmarks and mostly crude assumptions and extrapolations. Due to lack of
funding and staffing, there have been no survey-based national accounts since 1995, when
one was prepared with UNDP assistance, and to date there has been no survey at all on
manufacturing. In 2004, with the support of donors, a new population census and surveys on
subsistence agriculture and households were completed. These surveys have neither been
fully processed or updated. A July 2006 AFR mission helped the authorities improve GDP
estimates for 2001–05. The weights used to compile the consumer price index (CPI) are
based on an outdated survey from the late 1980s and are compiled irregularly across the
islands. Most price data are collected only for the country’s capital. CPI compilation and
quality control are conducted mainly by only one person.
Government finance statistics
3.
Classification of budgetary data is often not consistent over time or across the islands.
In particular, problems arise in data on domestic arrears, external debt, and external support
including its investment spending components. The latest data provided for publication in the
Government Finance Statistics (GFS) Yearbook refer to1987; no data are reported for
publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS). In August/September 2005, a
mission found that the public chart of accounts did not accurately record the execution of the
budget and that a standardized presentation on outstanding public debt is not compiled. In
order to address existing problems, the mission recommended the creation of a committee to
reform the public chart of accounts and strengthening of the coordination of accounting
methods used by the various islands. The mission encouraged the authorities to set up a
harmonized information system for budgetary and accounting operations. The mission’s
report also proposes various methodological improvements as well as an enhancement of the
dissemination of central government operations and public debt data.
External sector statistics
4.
The Central Bank of Comoros (BCC) compiles balance of payments statistics. With
technical assistance from an STA expert in April 2005, the BCC moved to adopt the IMF

8
Balance of Payments Manual, 5th edition. The expert helped the authorities prepare a work
plan to improve compilation of data on the balance of payments and international
investments. As a result, preliminary annual estimates are now available, though not yet
published, for 2003–05. The latest data on the balance of payments statistics submitted to
STA for publication refer to1995.
5.
Despite some improvement, balance of payments statistics remain inadequate, mainly
due to lack of adequate staff and financial resources for compilation. A single economist is
responsible for compiling balance of payments information. Improvement is needed in data
validation and coverage, particularly for trade, nonregistered trade, services, and foreign
direct investment. Trade data are less than adequate because of incomplete data transmission
from the Customs authorities. The July 2006 AFR mission helped the authorities strengthen
balance of payments data for 2001–05, based on more information on goods and services
trade and an improved estimation of inflows of emigrants’ remittances.
Monetary data
6.
The BCC produces adequate monetary statistics on its own accounts, for the two
commercial banks active in the country, for the deposits collected by the postal
administration, and for two microcredit operators. The CFA franc zone arrangement has
established accounting and prudential standards that prevent data disruptions. A major
shortcoming is the absence of data on the large amount of Euro cash in circulation. In May
2006, the BCC began reporting test monetary data to STA using the Standardized Report
Forms (SRFs) for the assets and liabilities of the central bank (1SR), other depository
corporations (2SR), other financial corporations (4SR), as well as for monetary aggregates
(5SR). Test monthly monetary data in the SRF format are now available for the period
January 2004–August 2008.
At the request of the BCC, a monetary and financial statistics technical assistance mission is
scheduled for late 2008. The mission will assess the reliability and internal consistency of
SRF test data submitted so far by the BCC, and will assist and provide guidance to complete
the migration to the SRFs.
Income distribution data and social indicators
7.
Some progress was made with collecting income-distribution statistics and social
welfare indicators when the I-PRSP was being prepared in 2003–04. However, since then
coverage has remained limited and there has been insufficient monitoring of progress
towards the MDGs.

postponed at the request of the authorities. As regards monetary statistics, the authorities are
requesting a technical assistance mission to review the SRF test data and identify possible
methodological departures from the recommendations of the Monetary and Financial
Statistics Manual.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
UNION OF THE COMOROS
Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis 2008
Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association
Approved by Emilio Sacerdoti and Anthony Boote (IMF) and
Carlos Braga and Sudhir Shetty (IDA)
December 2, 2008
Comoros is in debt distress. The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) shows that Comoros
would remain in debt distress under the baseline scenario, even in the absence of shocks. In
the alternative scenario, which for illustrative purposes assumes an hypothetical access to
HIPC/MDRI debt relief within the next 3 years, debt would become manageable, including
under a variety of stress tests.1
I. BACKGROUND
1.
Following cancellation in 2007 of US $34.5 million of arrears to the African
Development Bank (AfDB)2, the stock of Comoros’ public external debt declined to
56.7 percent of GDP (US$ 276 million), from 67.4 percent at end-2006. Eight tenths of
the debt stock is owed to multilateral creditors, the largest creditor is the International
Development Association (IDA)—which accounts for 45 percent of total debt, followed by
the African Development Bank (AfDB)—15 percent, and BADEA—12 percent. Among the
bilateral creditors, the Kuwaiti and Saudi Funds jointly account for about 15 percent of the
debt stock, compared with 2 percent for France, the only Paris Club creditor. Comoros owes
1

This is the second DSA prepared for Comoros using the debt sustainability framework for low-income
countries developed jointly by the IMF and the World Bank. The first DSA was prepared in 2006 at the time of
the last Article IV consultations. The DSA is based on external and public debt data from the Comorian

The African Development Bank cancelled 99 percent of Comoros arrears to the institution under its Post
Conflict Country Facility, with contributions from the AfDB itself (69 percent) and France and other donors
(30 percent).

no debt to the IMF. With more than two thirds of the total debt stock denominated in SDR,
12 percent in U.S. dollar, and 16 percent in currencies that are linked to the U.S. dollar, the
country’s debt situation in local currency is highly vulnerable to fluctuations in the Euro (to
which the Comorian Franc is pegged) exchange rate to the U.S. dollar.3 In 2007, domestic
public debt, including unpaid short-term central bank advances to the treasury, amounted to
the equivalent of US$16.6 million (3.3 percent of GDP).

Progress in clearing external debt arrears has been uneven. In addition to the

3
arrears to BADEA (US $26.7 million)4, the Kuwaiti Fund (US$27.7 million) and the Saudi
Funds (US$14.1 million). However, for various reasons, including lack of resources to carry
out payments set under the arrears settlement arrangements, the final agreements remain
pending in the case of the Islamic Development Bank, the OPEC Fund, the European
Investment Bank, the Arab Monetary Fund, the United Arab Emirates, and France. The
Comorian authorities have indicated that they remain engaged with these creditors, most of
which have reportedly expressed willingness to reach favorable understandings regarding the
unsettled arrears situations.
3.
Comoros’ NPV-based external debt indicators are above all indicative policydependent thresholds 5 The joint Bank-Fund debt sustainability framework (DSF) for lowincome countries classifies Comoros as a “poor performer”, reflecting the poor quality of the
country’s policies and institutions as measured by the 3-year average of the World Bank’s
CPIA ratings (Table 2).6 Within this framework, the ratios of all relevant external debt
indicators, in NPV terms, were above the indicative policy-dependent thresholds for
Comoros at end-2007; in particular, the ratio to exports of goods and services was more than
double (271 percent) the threshold. However, debt service ratios to exports and revenues
were below relevant indicative thresholds, reflecting mainly the impact of the AfDB arrears
cancellation and favorable rescheduling terms (delayed principal repayments) from other
creditors.

Note that new arrears were accumulated by the end-2007 following the rescheduling.

Comoros has not yet benefited from debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative and MDRI. However,
because the country has been assessed to have met the Enhanced HIPC Initiative income and indebtedness
criteria based on end-2004 data, it could become eligible for HIPC and MDRI debt relief. See “Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative—Issues Related to the Sunset Clause,” posted on the IMF Website
August 16, 2006.

II. UNDERLYING DSA ASSUMPTIONS
4.
Staffs performed a debt sustainability analysis under a baseline and an
alternative scenario. The baseline scenario is identical to the alternative, but without the
hypothetical assumption of an HIPC/MDRI debt relief. The alternative scenario is predicated
on steady post-conflict economic recovery underpinned by full restoration of inter-island
cooperation, good progress on fiscal consolidation, and implementation of key growthsupporting reforms. The scenario also assumes that the completion point under the HIPC
Initiative would be reached over the next three years and that Comoros would also benefit
from relief under the MDRI. Under such conditions, (i) real GDP growth would gradually
pick up from near stagnation in 2007, settling around 4 percent over the medium term;
(ii) the primary fiscal balance would steadily improve from a deficit (an average 1.7 percent
of GDP on during 2007–11) to a surplus of 0.3 percent of GDP during 2012–27, reflecting
improved revenue collection and enhanced control over current expenditure. The scenario
also assumes the resumption of external assistance in 2008 in the context of economic
programs supported by the IMF under the Emergency Post Conflict Assistance and
Exogenous Shocks Facility and, in late 2009, under the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility. This LIC-DSA assumes that all other arrears, including to Paris Club Creditors,
would be rescheduled on respective creditors’ standard terms.7
5.
The previous external DSA (2006 DSA) for Comoros assumed similar GDP
growth rates, but with much more favorable external and fiscal positions (Text Table 3).
Real GDP growth was projected to average 3.5 percent for the first five years (2006–10) and
4 percent for the remainder of the period; the new estimates are 2.4 for 2007–11, and
4 percent for 2012-28. The downward revision of the growth projections in the first five

5
years reflects weaker than expected growth performance in 2007 on the back of crisis
political conditions and more pronounced terms of trade deterioration. The last DSA
projected export growth of 16.4 percent on average for the initial five years and 8 percent
thereafter, compared with a more modest 10 percent and 3.7 percent on average, respectively,
in the new DSA, reflecting less optimistic prospects for world prices of Comoros’ key export
commodities. The 2006 DSA assumed a current account deficit (including grants) of
5½ percent of GDP on average for (2006–10), whereas the current DSA projects a higher
average deficit (9.4 percent of GDP for 2007-2011) driven mainly by high world prices of oil
and food. The current account deficits are projected to gradually decline to 6 percent of GDP
by the end of 2028. Like the previous one, this DSA assumes that the bulk of the identified
fiscal financing requirements will be met with grants. The political crisis of 2007 contributed
to a shortfall in government revenues, a fact that underpins lower projected revenue in this
DSA compared to the old. Despite these developments, the reduction in the debt stock
resulting from arrears cancellation, coupled with favorable rescheduling terms, has improved
debt dynamics under the current DSA, compared to the previous DSA.

Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions
Real GDP growth: GDP growth in 2008 is projected to stagnate at 0.5 percent, with a
sustained recovery projected to start in 2009 from a growth rate of 1 percent, accelerating
gradually to a peak of 4 percent in 2013. For the period of 2014–28, real GDP growth rate
averages 4 percent, close to the rate registered in 2005 following the previous secessionist
crisis. Growth during the recovery phase through 2012 would be underpinned by a good
agricultural supply response to higher food prices, renewed confidence and enhanced political
stability; stable terms of trade; and new FDI-led investments, especially in tourism and public
infrastructure. Longer-term growth would be driven by enhanced investment in key sectors and
by structural reforms aimed at enhancing competitiveness.
Inflation: Average inflation is projected to rise to 5.9 in 2008 from 4.5 in 2007, driven mainly
by high oil and fuel prices. In the absence of significant second round effects in 2009, average
annual inflation will settle at around 3 percent over the longer-term horizon.
Real exchange rate and terms of trade: After a modest appreciation in 2008, the real
effective exchange rate is projected to be broadly stable throughout the remainder of the
projection period; the terms of trade are expected to worsen further in 2008, before improving
somewhat through 2010, and remaining broadly constant thereafter.
Current account balance: The current account balance (including official transfers) is
projected to initially deteriorate from a deficit of 6.7 percent of GDP in 2007 to 10.8 percent
in 2011 followed by gradual improvements to about 6 of GDP by 2028. The initial worsening
of the current account balance would result from a further deterioration of the terms of trade
and strong import growth (especially for investment) outpacing exports. Service export is
expected to pick up steadily at an annual average of 10 percent, in response to improved hotel
infrastructure when the Galawa and other tourism resorts are completed by 2012, compared
with 5 percent during 1998–07.
Government balance: The primary balance (total revenue and grants less non-interest
expenditure) is projected to worsen slightly to a deficit of 2.7 percent of GDP in 2008 from
2.2 percent in 2007, and to gradually move into surplus beginning in 2013, as revenue
gradually increases and more efforts are made to maintain spending under control.
External assistance, scaling up and concessionality: The framework assumes that up to 2010
external assistance will be exclusively in the form of grants, averaging just under 7 percent of
GDP. Over the long-term (2011–28) further assistance will be available, in adequate terms,
including from IDA and AfDB.
Domestic borrowing: The scenario assumes no new medium to long-term domestic borrowing
beyond Central Bank’s short-term cash advances to the treasury.

8
III. EXTERNAL DSA
A. Baseline Scenario
6.
In the baseline scenario, Comoros’ NPV-based debt burden indicators remain
above the indicative thresholds for a prolonged period. Low growth and continued
accumulation of payments arrears keep all NPV indicators significantly above the countryspecific indicative thresholds for almost a decade, with the ratio of NPV of debt-to-export
barely below the threshold by 2028. Any stress test would worsen the situation further. For
example, under the stress test defined as a one standard deviation negative shock to historical
exports growth, the NPV of debt would reach 378 percent of exports of goods and services in
2010 or three times in excess of the threshold.
7.
However, debt service indicators are for the most part below the relevant
thresholds, reflecting mainly the impact of highly favorable terms under the arrears
rescheduling arrangements of 2007. This is illustrated graphically by a characteristic
hump-shape for the debt service-to-exports and to-revenue ratios.
B. Alternative Scenario and Stress Tests
8.
In the alternative scenario, with an hypothetical HIPC completion point and
MDRI relief assumed over the next three years, Comoros’ external debt indicators
would improve substantially. While the savings from the HIPC interim debt relief would be
roughly offset by new IMF borrowings (under EPCA and ESF in 2008 and PRGF assumed in
2009), Comoros would greatly benefit from the HIPC and MDRI relief after 2011, when all
IDA and AfDB debts, jointly accounting for about 60 percent of the total external debt, are
projected to be cancelled. As a result, following the HIPC completion point and additional
relief under the MDRI, the NPV of external debt would fall to 84 percent of exports, well
below the LIC DSA thresholds and debt service would average about 5 percent of exports.
9.
The debt dynamics under the adjustment scenario would be sustainable under a
variety of stress tests. Under the most extreme test, defined as combined one-half standard
deviation shocks to GDP, exports and non debt creating flows, the NPV of debt to-exports
ratio briefly breaches the threshold in 2011, but quickly falls below it thereafter. After the
shock, the NPV of debt would decline to 64 percent of exports after 2018; and the debt
service ratios would remain below relevant thresholds throughout the horizon.

Simple average.

IV. PUBLIC DSA
10.
Under the baseline scenario, Comoros’ debt is above LIC DSA thresholds.
However, under the alternative scenario, higher revenues and spending restraint will permit
achievement of a small primary fiscal surplus, anchoring fiscal consolidation and permitting
a gradual reduction of domestic arrears. Both NPV and debt service ratios drop faster
towards the end of the projection period than at the beginning, reflecting the impacts of
primary surpluses in the later years as well as repayment of the bulk of principal due to larger
creditors (IDA and AfDB).
V. DEBT DISTRESS QUALIFICATION AND CONCLUSIONS
11.
In the baseline scenario, Comoros is shown to be in debt distress, as evidenced
by recurrent arrears accumulation and prolonged breaches of the NPV of debt
thresholds. As in the previous DSA, under the baseline scenario the external NPV of debt
ratios are above country-specific indicative thresholds for most of 2008–24. The updated
public DSA for 2008 does not change this assessment. However, an alternative scenario
which assumes HIPC/ MDRI debt relief points to a significant improvement of the debt
outlook. The debt dynamics are somewhat vulnerable to lower real GDP growth and lower
export growth. These vulnerabilities underscore the importance of export diversification and
continued reform efforts.
12.
The authorities generally concurred with the thrust of this DSA. They therefore
expressed readiness to take the steps needed to facilitate Comoros’ eligibility to the enhanced
HIPC Initiative, including steadfast implementation of donor-supported reforms and
measures to address weak debt management capacity.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
December 15, 2008
1.
The information below has become available since the staff report was issued to
Executive Directors on December 2, 2008. It does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
All program prior actions have been implemented, including parliamentary approval of a
stability-oriented consolidated budget for 2008.
3.
During their discussion on Comoros at a December 10, 2008 meeting, Paris Club
creditors did not raise objections to the existence and expected continued accumulation of arrears
under the EPCA. The authorities have also reached understandings with all multilateral creditors
on how to address existing arrears.
4.

The authorities have:

•

Put in place a flexible-pricing mechanism for petroleum products. Henceforth, an interministerial committee will review and revise petroleum products prices on a quarterly
basis, as needed, to reflect changes in international prices. This should help make fuel
supply more reliable.

•

Initiated discussions with World Bank/IFC staff on a reform strategy for public
enterprises.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 24, 2008

International Monetary Fund

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Concludes the 2008 Article IV Consultation with Comoros
On December 15, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Union of the Comoros.1
Background
The Union of Comoros’ economic performance has weakened since 2006, due to a
precarious political environment, and against a backdrop of tensions in the global economy. In
2007, real GDP grew a scanty 0.5 percent, compared with an annual average of 2.5 percent
during 1999–2006. Business activities, especially imports, were hard hit by political tensions
with the island of Anjouan and limited credit availability—as the country’s sole commercial
bank curtailed operations in the wake of a disputed lawsuit. Economic activity remained
subdued in the first half of 2008, and real GDP growth is likely to stagnate at 0.5 percent in
2008. In addition to a further decline in the terms of trade, growth is held back by a difficult
energy crisis. Inflation rose sharply to an average of 4.5 percent in 2007 and is projected to
accelerate to 6 percent at the end-2008, driven by higher food and fuel prices early in the
year.
Fiscal performance has deteriorated further in 2007–08, although corrective measures are
being taken for 2009 and the medium term. The domestic primary fiscal deficit increased to
2.2 percent of GDP in 2007. Third-quarter revenue and current spending outturns for 2008,
including for wages, appear to be as targeted under the revised 2008 budget, suggesting that
the domestic primary fiscal deficit will rise to 2.7 percent of GDP in 2008. In the absence of

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and
discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters,
the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the
conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. This PIN
summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the 12/15/2008 Executive Board
discussion based on the staff report.

2
adequate aid disbursements, new domestic and external payment arrears are being
accumulated as sizable external debt service obligations fall due.
Monetary policy remains prudent. Money supply increased by a modest 1.1 percent in 2007,
with declining domestic credit offsetting gains in net foreign assets. Reflecting increased
financial intermediation, broad money growth is to accelerate to around 7 percent in 2008,
matching that of nominal GDP.
In the face of steady real appreciation of the euro-pegged Comoros franc, and with the termsof-trade declining by an annual average of 16 percent in the last three years, the external
current account deficit rose to the equivalent of 6.7 percent of GDP in 2007, up from
6.1 percent in 2006. The deficit is projected to widen further to 8.7 percent of GDP in 2008—
mostly on account of higher energy and food prices in the initial months of the year. The
external debt, projected at 236 percent of exports in net present value terms at end-2008, is
judged to be unsustainable. Addressing this problem will require comprehensive debt relief
under the enhanced Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiatives (MDRI).
Growth is likely to remain relatively subdued over the medium term in the absence of major
investment in agriculture, which represents over 50 percent of total value added, and despite
some revival of activity in tourism and donor-funded public works. As pressures on food and
fuel prices ease up, inflation is projected to decline to a trend 3-percent annual average,
anchored by the exchange rate peg.
In the next several years, the external current account deficit is projected to widen to 10–
11 percent of GDP, reflecting limited export volume gains and relatively strong worker
remittances-funded imports, following the end of the political conflict. Foreign direct
investment (FDI) is expected to increase in line with identified investment projects in banking
and tourism, including major revamping of some vacation resorts on the island of Ngazidja.
Consistent with these developments, external reserves are projected to decline to 5-6
months of imports.
As a result of heightened prudence in fiscal policy, the deficit on the domestic primary budget
balance is projected to gradually decline to about 1 percent of GDP by 2011 (2.2 percent in
2007), reflecting improved revenue performance and better control over spending, with a
focus on the wage bill. This will be key to accommodating some higher pro-growth and propoor expenditures.
In the structural area, key medium-term challenges for the authorities are to (i) maintain and
strengthen inter-island cooperation, (ii) address structural impediments to medium-term
expenditure viability, and (iii) begin removing core economic distortions. The authorities have
introduced and will maintain a flexible pricing mechanism for fuel prices over the medium
term. They are seeking World Bank assistance in assessing the financial health of stateowned enterprises to inform a reform strategy for the sector. Other structural reforms are
aimed at enhancing the efficiency of public administration. These include the adoption of
organic frameworks that set the appropriate structure and optimal level of staffing for the civil
service and, more generally, a comprehensive civil service reform to improve public service
delivery while reducing staffing to levels compatible with medium-term budget viability.

3
The full Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) is expected to be completed by end-March
2009. Comoros’ Interim PRSP (I-PRSP, 2006–09) was considered by the Boards of the IMF
and World Bank in May 2006.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors noted that after a long period of political instability, that had taken a severe toll on
various economic and social indicators, the return to political stability is allowing the
authorities to address deep-rooted macroeconomic distortions and structural rigidities. In
addition, the economy has been confronted with the impact of recent food and fuel price
shocks. Directors welcomed therefore the authorities’ intention to implement a broad-ranging
macroeconomic and structural reform program aimed at achieving fiscal sustainability, while
improving the investment climate and strengthening institutions and governance.
Directors considered the authorities’ fiscal consolidation efforts to be properly focused on
restoring inter-island cooperation, mobilizing revenue, containing the wage bill, and refocusing
spending on pro-growth and poverty-reducing programs. They welcomed the introduction of
measures to improve customs and tax administration, refocus civil service recruitment
policies, and streamline government ministerial portfolios. Directors recognized that Comoros’
fiscal prospects remain difficult as illustrated by sizeable financing requirements for 2009 and
beyond and by unsustainable public debt levels. They urged additional donor financing to
support the authorities’ efforts, while encouraging prudent public debt management.
They noted that the exchange rate peg continues to anchor macroeconomic stability, and the
staff’s assessment that the real effective exchange rate is in line with economic fundamentals.
Recognizing nonetheless the erosion of external competitiveness and narrow export base,
they supported the authorities’ plans to bolster the export sector and diversify the economy.
Executive Directors encouraged the authorities to vigorously implement their structural reform
agenda in order to place the Comoros economy on a more rapid growth path. Accordingly,
they welcomed the recent upward revisions of petroleum products prices and electricity tariffs,
following several years of a freeze, and the establishment of a flexible-pricing mechanism for
fuel products; these actions should make power supply more reliable, easing a key constraint
on growth. Directors endorsed the authorities’ plans to reform public enterprises and improve
the business environment, particularly in the agricultural sector, by streamlining business
licensing requirements and strengthening investor protection and the legal system. They
emphasized that an early completion of the PRSP would help set clearer priorities for the
structural reforms and identify needs for technical and financial assistance.
Directors underscored the importance of enhancing financial intermediation to facilitate
private sector growth and development. They welcomed the recent decision to allow entry of
additional foreign commercial banks. Directors also stressed the importance of enhancing
financial sector supervision. A few Directors called for a strengthening of the Anti-Money
Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework and in this context,
they welcomed the recent parliamentary approval of AML/CFT legislation. Directors supported

4
the ongoing reforms of the central bank’s statutes aimed at enhancing its independence, and
encouraged the authorities to address all areas identified in the 2007 safeguards assessment.
Successful implementation of the EPCA-supported program would in the view of Directors
permit a follow on the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement and
progress toward HIPC and MDRI debt relief, which would be essential to restore public debt
sustainability and would contribute importantly to creating fiscal space for poverty-reducing
expenditures.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 16, 2008

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Approves US$5.1 Million in Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance
and Exogenous Shocks Facility Disbursements to the Union of the Comoros
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved a disbursement
in an amount equivalent SDR 2.2 million (about US$3.4 million) under the rapid-access
component of the Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF) to the Union of the Comoros.
In September 2008 the Executive Board approved modifications to the ESF, which provided
for faster and higher access, made the facility easier to use, and enhanced its flexibility.
Those modifications came info effect in late November. The disbursement under the rapidaccess component of the ESF helps mitigate the impact of higher fuel and food prices on the
balance of payments in 2008.
The Executive Board has also approved a loan disbursement in an amount equivalent to SDR
1.1 million (about US$ 1.7 million) in Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance (EPCA) to
Comoros, bringing total support to Comoros to SDR 3.3 million (about US$5.1 million). The
support through the EPCA aims to address the immediate post-conflict challenges of reestablishing inter-island cooperation, initiating restoration of fiscal viability, tackling core
economic distortions, and gradually putting the economy on a path of stronger and
sustainable growth.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion on December 15, 2008, Mr. Takatoshi Kato,
Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“Against a backdrop of persistent political instability, Comoros’ growth performance has
suffered, while higher food and energy costs have weakened the external position and
adversely affected vulnerable groups. The external debt burden, including accumulated
arrears, is unsustainable. Membership in the franc zone, however, has served as an anchor of
stability. With political tensions declining, the authorities are to be commended for timely
introduction of a comprehensive economic and program to tackle these challenges.
“In the macroeconomic area, the government has resumed inter-island cooperation in budget
and economic management, and is endeavoring to strengthen the fiscal position through
implementation of strong revenue-enhancing measures and better control of the wage bill.
Achieving the 2008 fiscal targets will provide confidence to donors and to the private sector
regarding government readiness to put the budget on a sustainable path. To prevent a

2
worsening of the debt situation, the authorities will limit their fiscal deficits to levels that can
be covered by identified external assistance, mostly in the form of grants.
“On the structural front, the government has started tackling key structural impediments to
growth. The recent upward revision of petroleum products prices and electricity tariffs,
which reverses a freeze in effect over the last several years, is welcome. The authorities have
also established a flexible-pricing mechanism for fuel products, cognizant that this is critical
to making power supply more reliable—a key growth-supporting ingredient. Furthermore,
with technical support from the World Bank and other donors, the government has initiated
preparations for reform of state-owned enterprises, and is working to ensure completion of
the PRSP by end-March 2009. Other structural reforms are aimed at enhancing the efficiency
of public administration, including right sizing staffing levels for the civil service and
streamlining its organizational structure.
“At the same time, reform implementation risks remain considerable for Comoros, given
institutional capacity constraints, the challenging political environment, and the country’s
vulnerability to external shocks. In this challenging environment, close adherence to reforms
will be key to securing increased donor support, restoring economic competitiveness, and
more generally, creating conditions for accelerated growth; all of which would enhance the
effectiveness of the country’s poverty reduction strategy. To achieve a resolution of the
unsustainable debt situation will require moving to a PRGF-supported program and attaining
HIPC and MDRI debt relief.” Mr. Kato said.

ANNEX
Recent Economic Developments
Economic conditions have dramatically deteriorated in the Union of the Comoros in the last
two years. In 2007, real GDP grew a scant 0.5 percent, compared with an annual average of
2.5 percent during 1999-2006. Economic activity remained subdued in the first half of 2008,
and real GDP is likely to stagnate at 0.5 percent for the year as whole. In addition to a decline
in the terms of trade, growth is held back by a difficult energy situation following
cancellation in April 2008 of a long-standing fuel supply contract with a major French oil
company.
In 2007, inflation rose sharply to 4.5 percent driven by higher food and fuel prices. End-year
inflation is projected to accelerate to 9.6 percent in 2008, spurred by continuing pressures
from rising world food and fuel prices in the initial 9 months of the year.
Fiscal performance has weakened further in 2007-08, although corrective measures are being
taken for 2009 and the medium term. The domestic primary fiscal deficit increased to
2.2 percent of GDP in 2007, and fiscal data through end-September suggest that the deficit
will further rise to 2.7 percent of GDP in 2008.
In the face of steady real appreciation of the euro-pegged Comoros franc, and with the terms
of trade declining by an annual average of 16 percent in the last three years, the external
current account deficit hit the equivalent of 6.7 percent of GDP in 2007. The deficit is
projected to widen further to 8.7 percent of GDP in 2008––mostly on account of higher food
and energy prices in the first 9 months of the year. At a projected 236 percent of exports in
net present value terms by end-2008, the country’s external debt is unsustainable.
Program Summary
Against a background of low growth, the EPCA-supported program focuses on revenue
mobilization and containing the wage bill. The structural agenda seeks to gradually restore
inter-island cooperation, tackle selected structural impediments to medium-term expenditure
viability, and begin addressing core economic distortions. If successfully implemented, the
program could count as track record toward the decision point for debt relief under the
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. This could create conditions for longerterm donor reengagement in strengthening the authorities’ capacity to implement
macroeconomic policies.
The IMF support under the rapid access component of the ESF will help smooth adjustment
to a sizeable terms of trade shock in 2008. To address the shock, the authorities have initiated
critical corrective measures. Especially noteworthy are a tightening of fiscal policy and the
gradual introduction of market-based prices for key import and export commodities, all of
which should contribute to a narrowing of the Comoros’ external imbalances over time.

Statement by Laurean W. Rutayisire, Executive Director for Union of the Comoros
December 15, 2008

I. Introduction
Years of political instability have held back the economic development of the Comoros. Real
GDP growth rates remained low and the country’s social indicators have deteriorated. Comoros is
currently recovering from last year’s political crisis that ended in June 2008 with the election of a
new President for the island of Anjouan. Inter-island cooperation has since resumed and the
prospects for a return of political stability have significantly improved.
My authorities would like to thank management and staff for maintaining a close relationship with
the Union of the Comoros despite the difficult political situation. They also appreciate the useful
advice and support provided over the years. It is particularly unfortunate that last year’s
discussion of a PRGF-supported program had to be postponed due to the regrettable political
circumstances. They are confident that their current efforts to boost the economy and to preserve
political stability will benefit from the full support of the Fund and the international community.
In the weeks that followed the resolution of Anjouan crisis, my authorities have moved rapidly to
put in place a new economic reforms program, with the assistance of the Fund, that addresses the
post-conflict challenges. These include the need to raise growth to higher levels for more efficient
poverty reduction, and achieving fiscal sustainability while improving the investment climate and
strengthening institutions and governance. A critical component of the program will be the strict
adherence to the revenue sharing agreement between the islands, to which my authorities have
reiterated their firm commitment. To this end, they are requesting a six-month Fund-supported
program under the Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance (EPCA), covering October 2008–March
2009. My authorities have also requested a disbursement of 25 percent of quota under the RapidAccess Component of the Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF) to help cushion the impact of volatile
food and oil prices on the populations.
The goal of the EPCA is also to enable further diversification of the economy away from
subsistence agriculture and the production of vanilla and cloves, and reduce its vulnerability to
shocks. The authorities count on the EPCA’s catalytic role to garner much needed donor support.
This will help alleviate the burden of the debt service which continues to exercise a significant
drain on public finances. Urgent debt relief is crucial to restoring fiscal and current account
viability given that Comoros remains in debt distress. My authorities intend to move as rapidly as
possible to a PRGF-supported program that would pave the way for debt relief under the HIPC
and MDRI initiatives. In this regard, they are committed to a strict and full implementation of the
measures set out in the EPCA.
II. Recent Economic Developments and Prospects
Real GDP growth dropped to 0.5 percent in 2007 (from 1.2 percent in 2006) due to the political
crisis and a contraction of credit to the private sector. Growth is projected to remain low in 2008,
at 0.5 percent, and then rise slightly to 1 percent in 2009, driven by agriculture (subsistence
mainly), investment in the tourism sector, and public-sector works (funded by donors). Growth
should average 1.5 percent over the period 2008–11.

2
It is clear, however, that higher growth rates would be needed to accelerate poverty reduction
given the deterioration of the poverty situation in recent years, and –according to the most recent
data from the World Bank–, that 45 percent of the population lives below the poverty line.
Furthermore, access to basic social services remains limited. Although a key objective of the IPRSP –completed by Comoros in October 2005–, and the authorities’ request of an EPCA is to
implement growth-enhancing measures that would address the issue of poverty more effectively,
their determined efforts alone will not be sufficient to achieve this objective. It will also require a
considerable increase in financial aid from the international community to finance pressing social
needs and infrastructure. A comprehensive debt relief is also essential given the country’s large
indebtedness and the limited fiscal resources.
In addition, the global food crisis has had a severe impact on Comoros. Because half of the food
consumed is imported, local prices of vegetable oil and meat products, for example, have
increased by over 50 percent in the past three years, according to the World Bank, and the price of
imported dairy products has doubled in the last year. Inflation, more generally, rose to 4.5 percent
in 2007, from 3.4 in 2006, and is expected to remain high in 2009, at 4.9 percent.
To cushion the impact of high international prices on the population and the economy, the
authorities have, notably, temporarily reduced customs tariffs on certain food imports. Longer
term measures to promote agricultural development, with the assistance of the World Bank,
include better access to seeds for the production of traditional staples, and facilitating access to
credit for agricultural producers through the development of specific credit lines.
III. Debt Sustainability
Compounding the above difficult situation, Comoros is in debt distress, as well demonstrated by
staff in the DSA analysis. The country’s NPV of debt to exports ratio reached 249 percent in 2007
–very high above the HIPC threshold of 100 percent (applicable to “weak policy” LICs, such as
Comoros). As indicated in the DSA analysis, “even in the absence of shocks most debt indicators
would remain above the relevant policy-dependent thresholds, in the absence of HIPC and MDRI
debt relief.”
The authorities have made good faith efforts to reach understandings on arrears clearance with a
number of multilateral creditors, most notably with the AfDB in 2007 which cancelled $34
million in arrears. Discussions are still underway with other creditors, including the European
Investment Bank and the Islamic Development Bank.
My authorities would like to reiterate their commitment to a prudent debt management policy, and
as underlined in the MEFP, are committed to ensuring non contracting and non guaranteeing of
any nonconcessional debt during the period of the EPCA program. They will also consult with the
IMF before contracting or guaranteeing any external concessional debt above $20 million.
IV. Implementation of the EPCA
Fiscal sustainability. The re-establishment of the revenue sharing agreement and the authorities’
commitment to improve expenditure management are key steps toward sound fiscal management.
The authorities are in this regard determined to strictly adhere to the agreed quarterly meetings of
the Budgetary Committee, made up of representatives from the Union and the three islands.
Budget execution reports will also be prepared on a monthly basis and disseminated to the
executive branches of the Union and the three island governments.

3
To achieve fiscal sustainability, the authorities have taken a number of revenue-enhancing
measures that will improve the efficiency of tax and customs administration. They are also
making considerable efforts to slow growth in spending –especially the large wage bill which
absorbs approximately ¾ of fiscal revenues, and is a major source of arrears accumulation. To this
end, they have frozen all new hiring since August 2008.
However, despite their efforts to raise revenues and reduce spending, a financing gap of
4.8 percent of GDP ($25.1 million) is projected in the 2009 budget due mainly to higher debt
service obligations falling due. To address this gap, the authorities plan to organize a donors’
conference in the coming months to seek financing assurances.
Raising growth. The authorities are fully aware that strengthening financial intermediation is
crucial to enhancing growth. Accordingly, the central bank has granted licenses to two new
foreign commercial banks, the EXIMBANK of Tanzania and the Banque Fédérale des Comores.
The opening of these two new banks along with the resumption of the activities of the third
commercial bank will help support economic recovery.
Also in the financial sector, the authorities have approved the recommendations of the 2007 IMF
Safeguards Assessment. The priority recommendations are currently being implemented, notably
the establishment of an audit committee at the central bank. The audit committee has already
audited the 2007 accounts of the central bank.
To strengthen the investment climate, the authorities intend to develop a reform strategy for the
state-owned enterprises (SOEs) with the assistance of the World Bank, in the electricity,
telecommunications, and hydrocarbon sectors in order to attract investors and avoid a potential
burden from the liabilities of these enterprises on the country’s budget.
In an effort to reduce the operating losses of the SOEs in the electricity and hydrocarbon sectors,
the authorities have implemented a pass-through mechanism for petroleum products prices and
electricity tariffs which were frozen for many years. Electricity tariffs were adjusted in midOctober 2008 while prices of petroleum products were raised by 18 percent in August of this year.
The latter prices will be revised on a quarterly basis taking into account the evolution of
international oil prices.
V. Conclusion
Comoros is one of the few remaining countries that are potentially eligible to the HIPC initiative
but have not yet qualified due to an unstable political situation. My authorities are aware that a
successful implementation of the reforms under the EPCA would be key to reaching the decision
point soon given that the EPCA would count as track-record towards the HIPC initiative, and they
are strongly committed to stay the course. However, the aftermaths of post-conflict, aggravated by
the recent food and oil prices shocks render the policy implementation landscape to be extremely
challenging. It is for this reason that my authorities are also requesting a Rapid-Access
Component of the ESF. We call on the Fund and the international community to urgently provide
the needed support to Comoros to avoid a weakening of the reforms momentum and a return to
crises of the past.
