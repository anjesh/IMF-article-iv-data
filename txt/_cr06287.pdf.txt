EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The recovery is gaining traction but prospects beyond the near term are less assured.
While the euro area has been trailing the global upswing more than on previous occasions,
activity is gradually strengthening and may even surprise on the upside during 2006. Further
ahead, however, the risks move to the downside, given uncertainties in oil, currency, and
financial markets. Inflation is running above the ECB’s objective and is projected to continue
doing so into 2007 on account of exogenous shocks. However, these shocks have not
triggered significant indirect or second-round effects and staff project inflation to fall back
below 2 percent in 2008.
There was broad agreement on the economic outlook but the ECB saw the risks to price
stability more skewed to the upside than the staff. The latest ECB rate hike is consistent
with staff’s views but further withdrawal of accommodation should await a broadening of the
upswing––as evidenced by quickening employment––or signs of accelerating underlying
price pressures.
Key concerns focused on the area’s capacity to simultaneously stage solid employment
and productivity growth over the medium run. A marked slowdown in productivity
growth has offset a significant part of the increased labor utilization of the past decade; and
population decline is set to start around 2010. Adjusting Europe’s welfare states remains an
uphill struggle. The discussions focused on the need for mutually re-enforcing fiscal and
structural policies, specifically:
•

Taking advantage of the recovery to make significant progress toward achieving
broadly balanced fiscal positions by 2010, preferably by cutting expenditure in a
manner that fosters labor supply. Adjustment in 2005 has exceeded projections and
there was agreement that the reformed Stability and Growth Pact was gaining traction
over fiscal policies in high deficit countries. Countries plan to move toward balanced
budgets over the medium run, but plans are vague and prospects remain uncertain.

•

Accelerating the reform of product and services markets to ensure that labor market
restructuring translates into more employment rather than higher rents. In this regard,
the National Reform Programs under the reformed Lisbon Agenda offer an avenue for
designing consistent structural policies and developing national ownership of the
Agenda. The authorities also pointed to the adoption of a directive that opens EU
services markets to competition, even if less than originally sought.

•

Unlocking the potential of financial integration, which could provide a fillip to the
area’s growth prospects, while safeguarding stability. The Commission drew attention
to the major progress that has been achieved since EMU and new initiatives to foster
supervisory collaboration and coordination. Staff advocated tackling more decisively
the vested interests that, among others, hold up the integration of financial
infrastructure and add nation-specific layers to EU-wide regulations; and argued for a
clarification and further integration of supervisory powers over complex cross-border
groups to improve financial stability policies.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
After several years of disappointments, growth has picked up and broadened
over the past twelve months. In marked
Average Annual GDP Growth
contrast to the previous global upswing, euro(in percent)
area real GDP and domestic demand growth
Current
Prior Expansion
averaged only about 1½ percent during
( 2003-2005) (1997-2000)
2003-05 (Figure 1, Table 1). Since last
summer, however, the pace has accelerated
World 1/

somewhat and, more importantly, the recovery

has gradually been broadening:

notwithstanding significant quarterly
volatility, real GDP, final domestic demand,
and household consumption all grew between 1¾-2 percent in the year through 2006:Q1 and
the recovery has been gaining some traction in weaker parts of the area. Nonetheless, the
pick up in activity remains fragile, relying on strong global growth. Employment and
consumption continue to lag.
2.
Besides supportive external demand and financial conditions, the recovery
reflects in part improved fundamentals in the corporate sector:
•

Nonfinancial corporate profitability has
been strong and leverage has been
brought under control (Figures 2, 3).
Market-based financing activities have
begun to recover from recent lows and,
thus far, are not expected to be set back
significantly by the latest market
turbulence. Bank-based borrowing,
which picked up more than a year ago,
remains robust. While enterprise loans
have largely funded restructuring and
consolidation, lending surveys now
indicate that capital expenditures––
heretofore stuck in a holding pattern,
outside construction—are no longer a
drag.

Financial sector indicators also point to
improving positions (Figure 4, Table 2).
Many banks are well capitalized and booking
record profits, buoyed by favorable financial
market developments, low interest rates, low
costs of risk, cost containment, and booming
demand for mortgage loans. Fundamental
soundness has also been supported by
improvements in governance, risk
management, and regulation and
supervision.1

Price pressures appear contained,
notwithstanding sharply rising oil and
administrative prices (Figure 5). Headline HICP
inflation reached 2.5 percent in May and is likely to
stay above 2 percent for some time due to energy
prices, further administered price hikes, and the
expected VAT increase in Germany in 2007. However,
core inflation (HICP excluding energy and
unprocessed food) is running around 1½ percent,
reflecting limited indirect effects and the absence of
second-round effects. And services price inflation is
easing. This enhanced overall performance likely
reflects enhanced central bank credibility, better
functioning labor markets, global competition, and
cyclical slack.

The picture is generally less strong in the insurance sector, which has benefited from positive financial market
developments, but is suffering record catastrophe claims (reinsurers) and negative repercussions from low
interest rates (although life insurers have recently either lowered or phased out guaranteed rates of return).

The area’s external position and exchange rate appear broadly aligned with
fundamentals. Household savings remain stable and, while balance sheets might be
overstretched in some regions, this is not the case for the area as a whole, with the burden of
rising indebtedness offset by larger holdings of assets and low interest rates (Figure 6).
Combined with modest net borrowing by the corporate and public sectors, the external
current account is broadly balanced. Following an appreciation during 2002–03, supported
by significant net FDI and portfolio inflows, the real effective exchange rate of the euro has
been moving broadly sideways

The exchange rate assessment is done based on two different approaches—the macroeconomic balance
approach and equilibrium exchange rate approach. The macroeconomic balance approach consists of two steps:
first, econometric estimation of the determinants of the equilibrium medium-term current account balance and
estimates of the current account “norms”; and, second, determination of the exchange rate misalignment by
comparing the current account norms with the current account balances that would emerge at prevailing
exchange rates. The equilibrium exchange rate approach uses a reduced form model that relates the real
effective exchange rate to a set of underlying fundamentals.

II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
6.
With only modest prospects in sight even under favorable scenarios, the
discussions revolved around how to strengthen medium term growth, including from
the perspective of alleviating external risks. In this regard, there was agreement that past
reforms, while effective in strengthening employment, had disappointed in terms of growth
because of the enduring weakness of productivity. To address that issue, and with the
overriding importance of labor market reform well understood in official circles, product and
services markets, as well as the interactions between macroeconomic adjustment and various
structural reforms, featured more prominently than in the past (Box 1). Among services
market reforms, the discussions centered on the financial sector, which appears to explain a
significant part of Europe’s productivity gap and where there is a need for the financial
stability framework to keep up with growing cross-border activities.
Box 1. Effectiveness and Role of Fund Surveillance
Past Fund advice.
•

Monetary policy: Over the past few consultations, Fund staff has argued that, given the outlook
for price stability, monetary policy should remain accommodative until the recovery became
more sustained. The ECB kept rates unchanged for 2½ years and then raised them from
2 to 2¾ percent starting in December 2005.

•

Fiscal policy: Staff has been advising eliminating fiscal deficits through annual structural
adjustments of at least ½ percentage point of GDP. Staff welcomed the 2005 SGP reform but
cautioned that it made transparent and evenhanded implementation of the Pact more challenging.
Staff also advocated improvements in domestic fiscal governance institutions to support
adjustment. Implementation of the revised Pact, thus far, has circumscribed discretion and led to
some restoration of credibility.

•

Structural policy: Staff has been arguing that the reformed Lisbon Strategy offers the right
vehicle to increase national ownership of fiscal and structural policies, and thereby improve
chances of successful delivery, but was concerned that absent some form of public
benchmarking this policy framework would have no teeth. At the current, early stage, progress
with National Reform Programs has been mixed.

•

Financial sector issues: Staff has argued for further integration of regulation and supervision to
ensure that Europe’s financial stability framework keeps pace with cross-border business.

Effectiveness of Fund staff advice. In general, fiscal and structural reforms have proceeded but in a
much less decisive manner than advocated by the staff. On specific advice: (i) staff’s ½ percent fiscal
adjustment “benchmark” is a feature of the reformed SGP; (ii) staff’s advice on domestic fiscal
governance has been met with strong skepticism but is now on the agenda of the Finnish Presidency;
(iii) benchmarking was not adopted in the reformed Lisbon Agenda, contrary to staff’s views; and
(iv) staff’s advice on further integration of regulation and supervision was given a mixed reception but
has now been cited in motivating new ECOFIN initiatives in this domain.

the 2007 VAT hikes in
Germany should lead agents to advance purchases to 2006, albeit at the expense of 2007.
However, underlying developments on the household side remain soft. Employment growth
remains sluggish, partly because of the weakness of productivity that inhibits hiring, and real
wages are stagnating. Without a more rapid expansion of payrolls, consumption will weigh
on the recovery’s dynamics.3 Staff thus foresees actual growth around 2 percent in 2006,
broadly in line with other projections. For 2007, staff and others forecast a strengthening of
the underlying momentum (adjusting for the substitution effect of the VAT hike in
Germany), with excess capacity being slowly eliminated in the outer years.

2006:Q2 and Q3 (Figure 9). Furthermore, with
respect to domestic demand the Commission
considered risks more balanced than the staff, specifically pointing to upside risks to
household spending on account of pent-up consumer demand. However, moving into 2007,
the risks were seen on the downside, mostly on account of the recovery’s continued
dependency on external demand, global imbalances and exchange rate risk, flight from risk
in capital markets, volatile oil prices, and the avian flu.4 In addition, richly-valued housing
stocks and high household debt in some regions pose hazards for consumption as interest
rates continue to rise.
B. Monetary Policy: What are the Risks to Price Stability?
9.
The ECB views the risks to price stability as skewed to the upside, and has
begun to raise rates (Figures 10, 11). After keeping interest rates unchanged for two and
half years, the ECB raised its policy rate by 25 basis points in December, March and June, to
2.75 percent. The ECB’s stance is motivated by several considerations:
•

Headline inflation has been running above the ECB’s close to but under 2 percent
objective since 2000 and is projected to continue doing so through 2007 because of
further tax (notably, VAT in Germany) and administrative price hikes as well as oil
prices. While these shocks are acknowledged not to have given rise to significant
indirect or second round effects so far, unions are seen to be keenly aware of the
erosion of purchasing power so that the risks that such effects might materialize are
mounting as the recovery broadens. Additionally, imported manufacturing goods
prices are increasing as a result of the strength of the global upturn.

•

The conditions for an ongoing economic expansion appear in place.

4

Staff estimates suggest that a 10 percent hike in oil prices reduces real GDP growth by 0.2 percentage points
and directly raises inflation by 0.1 percentage points.

Monetary and credit dynamics are strong. Monetary aggregates are growing rapidly,
even when adjusted for idiosyncratic changes, driven mainly by the expansion of the
most liquid components. Private sector credit is expanding at double digit rates and
becoming more broadly based across sectors, with borrowing both by households and
non-financial corporations rising more strongly. These developments, together with
strong asset (notably housing) price dynamics, were seen to confirm the stimulative
impact of the historically low level of interest rates.

view––built around models that use various statistical measures of underlying inflation
(e.g., core, median, trimmed mean, or cross-sectionally and dynamically-filtered inflation) as
well as small structural models to forecast headline inflation––suggests that HICP inflation
should moderate to just under 2 percent in 2008 and that the risks around this baseline are not
significantly skewed to the upside (see charts).5 A simple but important indicator of low
fundamental price pressures is subdued current and expected ULC growth, with the cyclical
behavior of wages overwhelmed by trend restraint related to various structural changes.6
Moreover, in the context of continued slack, a weak labor market, and strong global
competitive pressures, the growing downside risks for international and domestic activity
over time also imply some downside risks for domestic prices.
12.
Staff also questioned whether
historical comparisons provided a good
measure of current monetary policy
accommodation and whether the link
between M3 and prices was clear enough
for operational purposes. While estimates
of the neutral rate––in the past usually taken
to have been around 4 to 4½ percent––are
impossible to pin down, there is evidence
for a downward trend, consistent with
revisions to potential output growth
estimates (Box 2). Also, the relation
between M3 growth—which averaged
7½ percent in 2005––and prices has been
unstable of late,7 reflecting shifting money
demand outside the “core” household
sector.

Brisk growth has partly reflected corporate
deposits and euros held overseas.

Whether the decline in nominal rates also
reflects a decline in nominal “neutral” rates
depends on the underlying sources of the
shifts. For example, declining long rates may
reflect a declining term premium, which need
not imply a decline in the neutral (short) rate.
Simple term-structure models for the euro
area, however, suggest a broadly stable term
premium. However, declining long rates
could partly reflect a falling euro-area growth
potential. If so, then this implies lower neutral
short rates in the euro area. Overall, lower
macroeconomic volatility, relatively high
global savings/low investment, and a falling
euro-area growth potential suggest that euroarea neutral rates likely have been moving
down.

1/ Calculated using standard coefficients, core inflation,
and fixed & dynamic neutral rate estimates.

Changing area neutral rates, although difficult
to pin down numerically, suggest increasing
uncertainty about the extent of monetary accommodation as illustrated by a Taylor rule. The
lower policy rate implied by the rule—i.e., based on a time-varying neutral rate—also suggests
that the extent of policy accommodation has become less clear.
ECB staff agreed that lower area potential output growth may imply a lower neutral rate but
thought that many other, international factors explained the global fall in interest rates and that
their implications for the area’s neutral rate were unclear. The ECB staff also stressed that the
neutral rate is very difficult to estimate in real time. Moreover, they thought that the present level
of rates was still below reasonable lower bound estimates for this rate.

24

13.
Considering the risks to prices and the uncertain prospects for activity beyond
the near term, staff argued that monetary policy needed to remain accommodative.
While the June hike––which staff considered warranted because inflation is expected to
revert to its benchmark only slowly and the recovery is gaining traction––leaves rates in
accommodative territory, continued tightening would, barring unexpected shocks to domestic
inflationary pressures, require a further broadening of the recovery, notably better prospects
for employment, of which there are as yet few concrete signs. Besides the unbalanced nature
of the recovery and the downside risks beyond 2006, the evolution of neutral rates, the risks
related to the exchange rate, and volatility in financial markets call for caution in normalizing
rates.
C. Structural Policy Issues and Challenges
Avenues to stronger growth
14.
The overriding policy concern is
how to overcome the area’s inability to
simultaneously achieve solid employment
and productivity growth (see chart). On the
whole, employment growth has been
remarkably strong over the past decade,
broadly on a par with the United States.8
Nonetheless, unemployment remains high
and labor participation rates low. Reducing
unemployment and fostering labor force
participation are the most direct avenues to
boosting per capita incomes and easing the
adjustment to aging. However, care must be
taken that such policies do not trigger an
offsetting slowdown in productivity, which
has been the case since the mid-1990s. This
slowdown is related partly to structurally
moderating labor costs and reforms that have
fostered the adoption of more labor-intensive
production processes. Furthermore, reforms
to labor markets have fostered employment
of the less skilled. But there was agreement
that these developments, together with
cyclical factors and the regularization of
“underground” employment in some area

difficult but they likely feature high job turnover costs and insufficient competition in
product and services markets. The underlying rigidities impede a reallocation of resources in
response to changes in preferences and technologies as well as globalization. In this regard,
ECB research suggests that some sectors that have been extensively deregulated recently
have featured rather strong productivity growth, notably telecommunications and transport.
Other sectors, for example, the wholesale and retail sectors as well as the financial sector,
have lagged. More generally, there is increasing evidence for the crucial role of competition
in fostering productivity-enhancing restructuring, including better management practices.10
Rigidities in labor and services markets also explain noticeable intra-area imbalances
(Box 3).

Commission studies suggest that the share of the intermediate and high-intermediate skilled in employment
has risen in all euro-area countries bar Spain since the early 1990s.

Box 3. Euro Area Divergences
Intra-area imbalances have
raised considerable concerns.
Current growth differences in
the euro area are not large by
historical standards and partly
reflect income convergence
(see Box 3, IMF Country
Report No. 05/265).
However, they appear to
feature a falling cyclical
component, a result of closer
integration and monetary
union, and a growing trend
component, in part related to
demographics but also due to
different degrees of structural
reforms and productivity
growth. Relatedly, crosscountry inflation differentials,
while not sizable, appear
highly persistent over the past
several years. The persistence
of inflation differentials has
contributed to divergences in
competitiveness and current
account balances, which
might take a painfully long
time to unwind.

under present circumstances.

27
16.
A staff analysis of the experience of Europe’s more successful long-term
reformers suggests that more decisive progress is less a matter of social choices than of
sticking to a forward-looking strategy, pursuing functionally and intertemporally
consistent fiscal and structural policies.11 Fiscal adjustment in these countries has centered
mainly on welfare reform and the government wage bill, using the ensuing labor supply and
related revenue improvements to cut taxes and maintain the reform momentum. These steps
were complemented by actions that enhanced both factor and product (goods and services)
market flexibility and thereby enabled a stronger response of job creation to wage
moderation while nonetheless maintaining productivity growth, with beneficial effects for
household incomes.12 Importantly, reforms along these lines also proved to be compatible
with broadly stable income distributions in several of the cases. By this standard, staff
thought that recent fiscal and structural area-wide policy initiatives—the reformed Pact and
the new National Reform Programs—offered some promise, but that bolder steps would be
needed on both fronts if decisive progress was to be expected.
Fiscal requirements: The SGP and the need to adjust during the upswing
17.
Outcomes were better than expected in 2005. At the time of the 2005 Article IV
report, Fund staff had not expected any significant adjustment for 2005. In the event, the
cyclically-adjusted fiscal balance for the euro area improved by close to ½ percent of GDP,
broadly in line with the staff’s recommendation. However, the area’s deficit remains large,
mainly on account of imbalances in the countries that are in the Excessive Deficit Procedure
(EDP) under the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), namely France, Germany, Greece, Italy,
and Portugal.
18.
The SGP is regaining some leverage over national fiscal policies. The
implementation of the EDP is improving: a large country, Germany, has been moved to one
step short of sanctions (Article 104.9) for failing to reduce its deficit below 3 percent of GDP
in a timely manner; and countries are taking significant steps to abide by their SGP
commitments. Moreover, in specifying their medium-term objectives (MTO), countries have

For example, staff research suggests that the pass-through of wage moderation into jobs and output in the
euro area over the past two decades was about half of that in the four non-area OECD economies with the least
regulated markets (see Estevão, M., 2005, “Product Market Regulation and the Benefits of Wage Moderation,”
IMF WP/05/191).

given heavy weight to reducing public debt. The 2006–08 fiscal targets in countries’ Stability
Programs generally feature an average annual structural adjustment of at least ½ percent of
GDP for those countries that have not reached their MTO, which is in line with past staff
advice. In particular, countries have not proposed to trade off adjustment with structural
reform. And the Stability Programs now feature more prudent macroeconomic assumptions
and a diminishing reliance on one-off measures. Overall, there was agreement that the
functioning of Europe’s fiscal framework had improved although key tests––achieving
adjustment during this recovery––and new challenges to the EDP (notably Italy’s difficulties
in correcting its fiscal deficit) lay ahead.
19.
The impending demographic shock is the main driver behind medium-term
fiscal requirements. In this regard, Commission officials pointed to the projections of the
Aging Working Group (AWG), which feature a “no-policy change scenario” showing that
aging-related spending would rise by about 3¾ percent of GDP through 2050. The AWG
project is a major improvement over a similar project undertaken in 2001, notably adding
transparency, consistency, and comparability to national projections. Staff welcomed the
report as a significant step forward in forging a consensus on the seriousness of the
demographic challenge. It argued, however, that some of the AWG’s alternative scenarios––
which suggest that the expenditure increase could be considerably larger––appeared more
plausible than the baseline “no policy change scenario” (Box 4). Commission officials agreed
that the projections were subject to considerable risks and these would be taken into account
in the forthcoming assessment of countries’ fiscal vulnerabilities.
20.
Given these projections, the key fiscal
6.0
policy requirement is for countries to achieve

reassuring: the 1998–2001 budgets—cast during

the structural weakening that is planned by non1.0
EDP countries for 2006 (chart). While countries’
proposed medium-term adjustment paths are

broadly in line with the staff’s recommendations,
2004
2005
2006
the measures to implement them remain
unspecified. Staff and the Commission thus project a structural balance for the area that
moves broadly sideways (Figure 12). Furthermore, absent significant reductions in
cyclically-adjusted deficits the EDP in some countries risks becoming open-ended and
damaging the Pact––a view stressed by ECB officials. Thus, while the national authorities’
commitments point to adjustment over the next few years, prospects remain uncertain.

Box 4. The Updated Demographic Perspective
The EU’s population will begin
to fall around 2010. According
to the “no policy change”
scenario in a report by the EU
Economic Policy Committee’s
Working Group on Ageing
Populations (AWG), this would
add about 3¾ percent
(4½ percent) of GDP on a net
(gross) basis to public spending.
Under plausible alternative
AWG scenarios, however, the
net increase might well be
6 percentage points of GDP.

1/ Assumes that healthcare costs rise in line with wages rather than per-capita GDP;
and that the probability of receiving formal long-term care rises gradually.

First, the “no change” projections assume a
significant acceleration in TFP growth and a
large sustained increase in employment,
something which Europe has not mustered since
the 1970s.
Second, some budgetary assumptions are
particularly critical, according to the findings.
For example, allowing health care costs to rise
with wages (rather than prices) and assuming a
slowly growing proportion of formal long-term
care would add a further 1½ percent of GDP to
spending, according to alternative scenarios in
the AWG report. Furthermore, savings on
education and labor market policies might not
materialize, if the experience of countries with
high labor utilization in Europe is relevant.

Third, the interaction between real
growth/employment, taxes, and debt is ignored
(because it is very difficult to model consensually) and therefore downplays the policy challenge.
For example, higher spending would have to be met with higher taxes––which would hold back
employment and growth––or more debt and interest payments, potentially creating fiscal
sustainability problems.
Lastly, member countries have made vastly differing progress in addressing aging-related costs and
this could affect the smooth functioning of the union. The “no policy change” estimates suggest that
the net increase in spending would range from lows of 0-2 percent (Austria, Italy) to highs of
8-10 percent of GDP (Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain).

Staff argued for improving national governance mechanisms to help overcome
pro-cyclical behavior during upswings and tackle the demographic challenge. The
credibility and effectiveness of fiscal policies would benefit from improvements in national
rules and governance mechanisms, points that had been taken up in ECOFIN Council
discussions and reports. In this regard, a key issue is to overcome popular disaffection with
adjustment, which requires deepening public understanding at the national level of the
longer-term issues facing countries and the role of policies in addressing them. Commission
officials agreed, noting that the evidence suggested that delegation of forecasting to
independent institutions is an efficient way to address biases; that independent institutions
have considerable impact and their advice is often followed by governments; that the quality
of their analysis is mostly considered above or well above average; and that there is a general
perception that they have improved fiscal discipline. National authorities are divided on this
issue, with some supportive and others skeptical, notably as regards the wisdom of creating
new institutions, their democratic legitimacy and accountability, and their likely
effectiveness. There is agreement that such institutions of necessity need to reflect national
arrangements and should eschew reaching normative (as distinct from “positive”)
assessments. The Finnish Presidency has made the issue a subject of discussion for the
second half of this year.
The reformed Lisbon Agenda: a vehicle for strengthened reform strategies?
22.
The National Reform Programs (NRP) provide a potentially promising vehicle
for designing policies that tap the synergies between fiscal and structural adjustment
and thereby boost productivity and employment simultaneously. On content, the NRP,
which were first prepared in fall 2005, tend to be fairly comprehensive and forward looking,
although they vary considerably as regards concreteness and often remain silent on
complementarities––in fact, key structural policy measures entail either lower fiscal revenue
or higher expenditure and therefore could complicate fiscal adjustment––and sequencing of
reforms. The need for labor market reform is widely acknowledged. But, whereas programs
hone in on active labor market policies and lower payroll taxation, they shun steps that might
facilitate job turnover. The Commission explained that increased spending on R&D (the
target is 3 percent of GDP), including for the creation of a European Institute of Technology,
and a reduction in the administrative burden on companies featured prominently in the
programs and were central to efforts to reinvigorate productivity.
23.
Staff felt that boosting productivity required more concerted action, notably
around reforming the services sector, a concern which Commission and ECB officials
shared. Services account for roughly two-thirds of the EU GDP. With only 8 percent of
services output being traded, partly because of the many barriers at the national level, staff
welcomed the adoption of the revised services directive. However, it expressed regret that the
country of origin principle (CoOP) had been dropped, as this could reduce the potential
output and employment gains from the directive by some 30-odd percent (Box 6). In the
staff’s view, much could be gained by strengthening competition in this sector, including in
exempted services such as work agencies and liberal professions. Furthermore, there was

32
agreement that more progress was also needed in sectors covered under separate directives,
notably energy, railway, and postal services.
24.
Notwithstanding improved ownership, concerns about NRP implementation
linger. Commission officials noted that the NRPs had fostered greater coordination at the
national level and had been reviewed in parliaments and discussed with social partners in
virtually all countries. Thus, while the NRPs still needed to feature in broader reform
debates, they nonetheless represented a step towards increased ownership. Another concern
is that specific targets and timetables are often missing from the programs. This will make it
difficult to evaluate implementation but a framework to do so in a consistent manner is under
development.
Financial sector: broadly healthy but still too segmented
25.
Financial markets are generally healthy and supportive of growth, but not
without vulnerabilities. The national authorities and staff agreed that the soundness of the
euro area’s financial system has continued to improve, but is subject to risks, some of which
are increasing. Risks include a possible disorderly unwinding of global imbalances, potential
mispricing of assets due to the hunt for yield, the exponential growth and opacity of the
Credit Risk Transfer market, and the ongoing tightening of global liquidity conditions. Bank
profitability has reached very high levels, but some of its current drivers are likely to become
less supportive going forward. The insurance sector has continued its recovery, thanks to
benign financial market developments and improving underwriting income. At the area-wide
level, accelerating credit growth does not raise prudential concerns. The financial situation of
the corporate sector has improved further, although there are indications that the credit cycle
may have turned and interest rate sensitivity increased. Household balance sheets appear
sound at the euro area level, but risks exist in countries that have seen rapid housing price
inflation and widespread use of variable-rate mortgage loans in a context of high household
debt levels. The Commission had some doubts about the effectiveness of using additional
prudential or fiscal measures at the national level to contain such risks, as advocated by staff.
The mission’s counterparts had no uniform views on the extent to which credit growth in the
new member states posed risks.
26.
Staff remains concerned that
financial integration, and area-wide
growth, is being slowed by entrenched
interests and institutional legacies. Europe’s
anemic productivity growth is in good part
traceable to this sector: empirical estimates
suggest that about half the productivity growth
gap between the area and the United States
over the past decade can be traced to the

financial sector (excluding insurance).13 While bond and money markets have largely
integrated, retail banking, equity markets, and markets in collateralized securities remain
segmented, thereby slowing efficiency gains and contributing to regional economic
divergences. The same holds for payments as well as clearing and settlements systems, which
makes cross-border business and trading expensive. More generally, wide differences in
taxation procedures (very relevant for VAT on intra-group transactions), consumer
protection, and contract law pose formidable obstacles to the integration and development of
Europe’s capital markets, notwithstanding rapid financial innovation. Specific concerns
include the following:
•

The integration of payments and, particularly, of clearing and settlement systems is
being held up by vested interests. Given the benefits of integration (Box 6), the
Commission is considering legislative action.

•

There are instances of vested interests capturing legislative initiatives and the
Lamfalussy process and turning integration and harmonization into something more
akin to a collection of national practices rather than best practice. This is regrettable
because, according to a review of EU country IMF Financial Stability Assessment
Programs (IMF FSAP), the prudential infrastructure in EU countries does not fully
meet international best practice.14

•

The segmented supervisory framework stands in the way of optimization across
borders of banks’ operations and is not cost efficient.15 Furthermore, the
centralization of risk management functions of large financial groups and their
increasing presence in many countries creates tensions between home and host
country supervisors that are amplified by legal and regulatory differences. Key issues
revolve around the public good nature of financial stability, externalities, and
asymmetric information, both at the macroeconomic (e.g., the optimal response to
housing market booms) and the microeconomic (e.g., cross-border transfers of assets
by large groups as well as cross-border business and deposit insurance) level.

•

Europe’s financial stability framework, including crisis management and resolution,
needs to keep pace with the emergence of complex cross-border financial institutions,
considering also that cross-border diversification has not lead to a decline in systemic

13

Microeconomic evidence points in the same direction as macroeconomic data (see IMF Country Report
No. 05/266, Chapter VI).

15

See Selected Issues paper “How Good is Financial Sector Regulation and Supervision in Europe?”

The Capital Requirements Directive, for example, allows national discretion in various areas. To avoid
complex dealings with many national supervisors, some financial conglomerates are therefore considering
adopting the Basel II advanced approach only at the group level, not for cross-border subsidiaries.

34
risk. Staff considers that the dispersion of information and competencies related to
financial stability over different institutions and decision-making levels hinders the
timely identification of threats to financial stability and optimal policy responses. In
particular, more detailed information should be made available at the central level,
and coordinated prudential action should be made possible, including for problems
that involve multiple, but not all, member states.
27.
Although recognizing these difficulties, the authorities viewed the EU Financial
Services Action Plan (FSAP) and Lamfalussy process as delivering significant progress
towards financial market integration and prudential convergence. Integration is proving
complex essentially because financial services revolve around contracts and contract law
differs widely across countries and because of different rules and cultural perspectives.
Accordingly, the EU FSAP entails significant legal and regulatory changes, many of which
still need to be implemented on the ground and this is what the authorities’ plans are now
focusing on. The authorities also noted that the flexibility inherent in the Lamfalussy process
made it easier to adjust in the face of changing circumstances than would be the case with
Directives. Turning to supervision, the plans center on improving convergence and
collaboration through the Lamfalussy process, by fostering: (i) non-binding mediation to help
solve day-to-day supervisory disputes; (ii) the use (on a voluntary basis) of delegation
between supervisors, particularly to help optimize the functioning of cross-border
supervision, through the elaboration of guidelines for supervisors and the promotion of
colleges of supervisors; (iii) a significant streamlining of reporting requirements for crossborder business; and (iv) supervisory disclosure. Staff welcomed these changes and
acknowledged that progress was underway. However, considering the opportunity costs, this
remained slow, particularly in key cross-border areas. It argued at a minimum for improving
information flows between supervisors, notably by establishing a central repository with upto-date information on systemically-important financial institutions that could also serve as a
platform to aid crisis coordination efforts.

28.
The hesitancies about euro-area integration extend to integration with the New
Member States (NMS) and the rest of the world as well:
•

16

Instances are the latest spat over cross-border M&A; the watering down of the EU
services directive; barriers to migration from NMS; and concerns about euro-area
entry of new members even though some of these seem well-positioned to instill a
greater dynamic to the area.16

From a “half-full” perspective, it should be noted that several countries have decided to join the United
Kingdom, Ireland, and Sweden in opening their job markets to workers from NMS; controversial cross-border
M&A did go ahead; a services directive with significant beneficial effects was adopted; and Slovenia was
admitted into the euro area.

35
•

Similarly, positions on trade liberalization, including access to EU agricultural
markets, are hardening, which has had direct consequences for selected emerging
markets (Box 5)––as well as domestic consumers––and may also affect the outcome
of the Doha Round.

Box 5. EU Textiles Trade Following Expiry of Quotas in 2005
The removal of the last, or “Phase IV,” quotas on textiles and clothing (T&C) on January 1,
2005 changed the structure of T&C imports into the United States and EU. Based on data for
January-November, U.S. and EU imports of Phase IV T&C products from all source countries
increased by 7.7 percent and 5.8 percent in 2005, while unit prices declined by 5.4 and
4.5 percent respectively. However, imports from China tripled in the United States and almost
doubled in the EU. Although the surge of imports from China was mostly at the expense of
other countries, U.S. and EU producers experienced strong price pressures. This has prompted a
return to managed trade. In particular, in June 2005 the EU negotiated a bilateral agreement
limiting China’s T&C exports (the United States negotiated a similar agreement with China in
November 2005). Afterwards China’s import share for products covered by the agreement––
which had increased from 8 percent in 2004 to 25 percent in January-May 2005––barely
budged. Moreover, the agreement raised the prices of covered T&C products back to pre-2005
levels.
The removal of the quotas and the subsequent restrictions on China’s exports have had mixed
effects on other countries’ exports. Sub-Saharan Africa has been the most severely affected
region, even though market losses may have been limited somewhat by the EU-China
agreement. Exports from the Middle East and North Africa may also have benefited from this
agreement as EU imports bounced back in June-November. South Asia is the only region,
outside China, that did not suffer export losses in the EU market.

Staff stressed that integration in its various forms had been a lasting engine of
growth for Europe, and that EU leadership on the multilateral trade negotiations
provided an immediate opportunity in this regard. Concluding an ambitious Doha Round
agreement remains the EU’s most important trade policy priority, but the window of
opportunity for agreement is closing rapidly. Effective access to EU agricultural markets is
key to an ambitious Round, including sensitive product designations that remain truly
exceptional and are not unduly restricting. The Commission noted that its agriculture offer
would create new export opportunities in all sectors, but that any further flexibility was
conditioned on the value of trade partners’ offers, including effective new access for
manufactures and services in the more advanced developing countries.
30.
As the EU’s interest in free trade agreements (FTA) grows, it should seek
stronger international discipline in this area. Negotiations with Central America were
launched in May, others with Asia are under consideration, and staff is concerned that a
disappointing outcome from the Doha Round might spur a strategic shift towards FTA. This
can add to the existing proliferation of such initiatives and undermine the multilateral fabric
of world trade. The presence of defensive motives––i.e., reacting to others’ FTA––suggests
there is scope to agree mutual restraints, or the inclusion of open-access clauses for countries
wishing to accede existing FTA. Simple and liberal rules of origin are crucial to avoid
burdening cross-border value chains. The Commission agreed that shallow integration
agreements were weakening multilateral resolve. It noted that it was seeking improved
discipline on FTA as part of the Doha Round, and that its FTA were aiming for deep
integration that ensured complementarity with the multilateral trading system.
31.
Aid for Trade and integration initiatives are increasingly prominent tools of EU
development policy. The Commission has defined an ambitious agenda for delivering Aid
for Trade, which grew some 40 percent to almost euro 1 billion in 2005, and is examining
ways to help channel stepped-up trade-related support by member countries. Economic
Partnership Agreement (EPA) negotiations on intra-regional integration and free trade with
the EU continue with six ACP regions (77 countries). The talks are targeted for completion at
end-2007, but in some cases this timeline will be difficult to meet, e.g., due to differences
over scope of the agreement and, in some cases, the related geographical configuration
issues. Staff suggested that the development impact of EPA would depend partly on avoiding
excessive discrimination favoring EU goods (e.g., through rules of origin) and services, and
on the extent to which they supported open and competitive markets.
Global imbalances
32.
Notwithstanding a broadly balanced exchange rate and external position, the
euro area remains precariously exposed to a disorderly resolution of global imbalances.
The authorities agreed that the exchange rate of the euro was broadly appropriate from a
multilateral perspective (Box 6), aligning closely with its 1980–2005 average. An orderly
market-led resolution of global imbalances was viewed to have relatively limited effect on

37
activity in the euro area. Instead, concerns focused on a disorderly resolution. Indeed, given
the euro’s role second only to the dollar internationally, and in light of recent history, the
euro remains disproportionately susceptible to a sharp, multilateral appreciation if market
sentiment in the dollar were to sour.17 Staff’s position has been that this would warrant an
easing of monetary policy, assuming no other changes to the outlook for inflation.

Box 6. Reforms in the Euro Area and Global Imbalances
Staff estimates indicate that from a medium-term perspective the euro’s exchange rate is broadly
aligned on a multilateral basis. Nonetheless, the area has committed to contributing to an orderly
resolution of global imbalances through enhanced structural reform. Progress, however, has been
slowed by popular resistance to both labor and services market reforms.
The potential welfare gains from reform are substantial:

According to studies by Copenhagen Economics and the Central Planning Bureau in the
Netherlands, liberalization of the services sector would yield significant output and employment
benefits for the euro area. Full implementation of the services directive, including the CoOP,
would boost employment by 600,000-2.5 million and GDP by 0.8-1.8 percent––the impact of
the CoOP is between 10-30 percent––with the higher numbers accounting also for dynamic
effects and hence more credible.
A common clearing and settlement systems would lead to lower transaction costs of up to
18 percent, increasing GDP by around 0.6 percent (European Commission).
Integration of bond, equity, and bank markets would reduce firms’ financing costs, raising GDP
by 1.1 percent and employment by 0.5 percent, about one million new jobs (London
Economics).
Integrated European mortgage markets could yield a net gain of 0.9 percent of GDP over
10 years (London Economics).
Implementing the Lisbon reform package could raise Europe’s growth potential by ½ to
¾ percentage points over the medium term.

33.
The national authorities concurred that reducing imbalances must be seen as a
shared responsibility, with all major regions putting in place appropriate policies. The
widening of global imbalances in recent years has been driven by a diverse combination of
forces, including differences in productivity growth and investor preferences, sharp declines
in US savings, relatively weak domestic demand in much of Asia, exchange rate policies, and
higher energy prices. Thus, action on several fronts is necessary to foster an orderly
rebalancing. Regarding the euro area, measures that boost employment and productivity—

See IMF Country Report No. 04/235, Chapter IV.

38
particularly through reforms of non-tradables (notably services) markets––would be
supportive of global growth, promote faster convergence of the NMS,18 and help facilitate an
orderly unwinding of global imbalances, a point of view which the Commission and ECB
officials shared. By way of example, staff argued that a rebalancing would require restraint in
domestic demand in some parts of the world. To help fill the ensuing growth shortfall,
implementing the Lisbon reform package could raise the EU's growth potential by
½ to ¾ percentage point over the medium term;19 staff also pointed to more specific reforms
and their estimated benefits. These reforms could prompt confidence effects that would
hasten beneficial effects for area growth and could lead to some significant rebalancing,
according to EC staff simulations. At a minimum, they would improve the area’s resiliency
to a possible disorderly resolution of imbalances.
E. Other Issues
34.
The EU’s AML/CFT framework is being further enhanced through increased
cooperation and the development of common approaches. A new Directive on AML/CFT
was promulgated in October 2005 and full implementation is expected by end-2007. To
prepare for a potential pandemic, the Eurosystem is adapting its business continuity plans,
focusing in particular on guaranteeing the functioning of key market operations and
infrastructure. Challenges include increasing remote access facilities for ECB staff and the
consistency of business continuity plans across the Eurosystem.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
The euro area is emerging from the doldrums and needs to focus on translating a
cyclical rebound into sustained growth. Economic activity appears to be finally catching
up with business sentiment, and past reforms, especially in the labor market, are bearing fruit.
But persistently sluggish productivity is inhibiting more sustained growth. Policies need to
address this and tap the synergies of fiscal adjustment, labor supply reforms, and competitive
product and services markets as well as accelerate the area’s integration with the new
member states of the EU and the rest of the world.
36.
The near-term outlook appears propitious but prospects for a more sustained
expansion are less assured. Buoyed by strong global growth and accommodative financial
conditions, restored business confidence and rebounding profitability are finally translating
18

The catch-up process in the NMS has unquestionably benefited from further trade expansion with the EU15,
greater policy discipline, and larger use of foreign savings. However, low real GDP growth in the EU15 has
slowed the real convergence of NMS incomes––for the CE-5, by ½-1 percentage point a year over 2000–04,
according to staff research “Growth in the Central and Eastern European Countries of the European Union—A
Regional Review,” forthcoming Occasional Paper, No. 252.

Economic Impact of Lisbon-type Reforms,” Occasional Paper, No. 16.

39
into higher investment, and a consumption recovery appears in the works. Accordingly, GDP
growth should remain around 2 percent, and could even be higher this year. But weak
fundamentals are likely to dampen a more sustained recovery. And risks are firmly tilted to
the downside in 2007 and beyond, in the face of an increasingly precarious external
environment, notably unresolved global imbalances and the risk of further euro appreciation,
although, from a multilateral perspective, the area’s currency trades broadly in line with
fundamentals.
37.
With inflation projected to ease over the next 24 months and prospects for
activity beyond the near term uncertain, monetary policy can afford to remain
accommodative. Monetary conditions are appropriate. Even though inflation is running
above the close to or below 2 percent benchmark, it is expected to fall back after 2007, as
one-off shocks abate, and risks increasingly lean downwards. Inflation expectations also
remain well anchored. Absent significant indirect or second round effects from exogenous
price shocks, further tightening can await a firming of the recovery, as evidenced by
accelerating employment. The risks of currency appreciation as well as the uncertainties
about the extent of monetary accommodation (as a result of the decline in potential growth
and relatively high savings) also warrant a cautious approach to raising rates.
38.
Boosting Europe’s sagging growth potential will require steadfast pursuit of
mutually reinforcing fiscal and structural policies. Not only is productivity growth falling,
populations will begin to decline around 2010 and this poses major challenges for Europe’s
welfare states. Adjustments to, rather than a revamping of, Europe’s welfare programs may
well suffice to prepare for the demographic shock, provided all policy levers are set in a
manner that leverages the synergies between them. The examples of Europe’s most
successful reformers point the way. These countries twinned fiscal adjustment through
expenditure reduction with labor supply reforms and nurtured flexible labor and product
markets to allow wage moderation to translate into jobs rather than rents.
39.
The key challenge for fiscal policies and the credibility of the Stability and
Growth Pact is the need to consolidate as the recovery unfolds. The reformed Pact is
regaining some traction over fiscal policies. The Excessive Deficit Procedure is being
implemented in line with the rules. Some progress is also evident on the preventive side of
the Pact, as countries opt for underlying balance over the medium-term, refrain from
exploiting loopholes, and base programs on more realistic assumptions than before. But, at
the cusp of better times and considering the looming demographic shock, countries at some
distance from underlying balance need to urgently identify measures equivalent to at least
½ percent of GDP annual adjustment over the coming years, focused on the expenditure side.
Given the soft nature of the preventive arm in particular, the rules could usefully be
buttressed by non-partisan national governance mechanisms that appraise policies in a
forward-looking manner.

40
40.
The integrated National Reform Programs under the rejuvenated Lisbon
process offer platforms for carrying forward the product and labor market reform
agenda at the national level, but they need strengthening. Given the adverse
demographics, reforms that raise labor utilization must continue to be paramount but
programs also need to devote more attention to boosting productivity, not just through R&D
spending, but also by intensifying competition in the internal market, especially in the critical
services sector where rents are rife. Such an approach would also support an orderly
unwinding of global imbalances and limit downside risks from financial fallout in the euro
area. Furthermore, ownership has been enhanced by involving national parliaments and
social partners in the debate, but much more remains to be done for these plans to become a
fulcrum of public debate and a stepping stone to more consistent policies at the national
level.
41.
The EU FSAP and Lamfalussy process are fostering the integration of Europe’s
financial markets, but the pace is too measured given the opportunity costs. Much of the
euro area’s lagging productivity performance can be traced directly to the financial services
sector and thus policies need to hone in on removing the many remaining cross-border
barriers to integration. This will require using all the tools available to competition policy
and more forceful public intervention where stakeholders stymie the establishment of open,
market-based solutions, notably at present in securities clearing and settlement systems. At
the same time, a clarification and further integration of supervisory powers over complex
groups––supported by legal and regulatory changes at the national level––will be necessary
to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of financial stability policies, notably prudential
policies and crisis management. While the issues are complex, postponing political decisions
on key drivers, such as the fiscal dimensions of crisis resolution, could significantly slow the
process of integration. In the meantime, the latest initiatives to improve supervisory
collaboration and convergence are pragmatic steps forward that deserve strong support from
national capitals. As in other areas, the key test will be their rapid implementation. In this
regard, priority should be placed on improving information flows between Europe’s
supervisors, notably by establishing a central repository with up-to-date information on
systemically-important financial institutions that could also serve as a platform to aid crisis
coordination efforts.
42.
Concerning trade policy, all parties need to redouble their efforts to bring the
Doha round to a successful conclusion, and resist the temptation to resort to
undisciplined bilateralism. As the window of opportunity is closing rapidly, only a serious
political commitment can break the logjam at this stage of the game. For its part, the EU
should endeavor to achieve the effective liberalization of agricultural market access, chiefly
by keeping sensitive product designations truly exceptional and not overly restrictive. It
should also try to reach agreement with other players to collectively call a halt to the
proliferation of bilateral trade initiatives, which only contribute to the fragmentation of world
trade, and instead renew their commitment to tried and tested multilateralism.

41
43.
While the external position of the euro area is broadly balanced and the euro is
seen as falling within a fairly-valued range from a medium-run multilateral perspective,
stronger growth is needed to facilitate orderly adjustment to global imbalances and
limit downside risks to the euro area. A positive outcome of rebalancing for the euro area
hinges crucially on its ability to inspire investor confidence by increasing the relative
attractiveness of holding euro assets. While this can be achieved through a variety of
measures, the most effective in the current context would appear to be steps to strengthen
competition in the services sector, which, besides boosting productivity, would help
accelerate growth and demand.
44.
Quality, availability, and timeliness of statistics are adequate for effective area-wide
surveillance and have continued to improve.
45.
It is proposed that the next consultation on euro-area policies in the context of
Article IV obligations of member countries follow the standard 12-month cycle.

Appendix I. Statistical Issues
Statistics for the euro area (and the EU-25) are produced by Eurostat and the ECB, generally
on the basis of data reported by member states. These statistics are of sufficient quality,
scope and timeliness to allow effective macroeconomic surveillance. Nevertheless, important
gaps and weaknesses remain, many of which relate to specific challenges arising from the
euro area’s young age, changing composition, and supra-national nature. Major progress has
been made over the past year, including significant improvements to the euro area (i.e.,
“national”) accounts and the publication of euro area accounts per institutional sector, and
efforts are well advanced to fill some of the remaining gaps. A major new gap is the current
non-availability of euro area accounts predating 1995. More recent and higher-frequency
indicators of corporate profitability, internationally comparable and higher-frequency
financial soundness indicators, housing market indicators, and improved statistics on nonbank financial intermediaries would be desirable. Ongoing work at Eurostat and the ECB
gives high priority to improving the timeliness, length, consistency and quality of dataseries.
Efforts to improve the monitoring of member states’ fiscal accounts are not yet fully up to
speed and seem hampered by insufficient effectively available resources.
•

Two major changes were introduced in the euro area accounts at end-2005: (i) the
allocation of Financial Intermediation Services Indirectly Measured (FISIM) to the
final and intermediate consumption of different sectors and activities, and to net
exports; and (ii) the use of chain-linked volume measures. The dataseries were
revised back to 1995 and publication for earlier years was suspended. Revised pre1995 data are not likely to become available before the end of the year at the earliest.
The allocation of FISIM implied an upward revision to GDP levels, amounting to
about 1 percent for recent observations. Revisions to GDP growth rates were
relatively small, generally not exceeding 0.1 percentage points in terms of quarter-onquarter growth.

•

On May 31, 2006, Eurostat and the ECB released euro area (and EU-25) accounts per
institutional sector, on an annual basis covering 1999–2004. These accounts provide a
wealth of information on the financial and non-financial transactions between the
different sectors of the economy (households, non-financial corporations, financial
corporations, and general government) and the rest of the world, as well as financial
balance sheets per sector. The accounts include details on disposable income and
savings rates, thereby filling an important gap. Publication of quarterly euro area
accounts per institutional sector is planned from spring 2007 onwards, and work on
non-financial balance sheets per sector continues.

•

A revised Nomenclature générale des Activités Economiques dans les Communautés
Européennes (NACE) classification is planned for 2007, in the context of the UN’s
revision of the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC). Implementation
at the member state level is planned for the 2008–2011 timeframe and will likely
entail new problems with backward compatibility.

•

Work continues to improve the availability of fiscal statistics and reduce the risk of
misreporting by member states. Eurostat has launched a new section on Government

47
Finance Statistics on its website. During the spring of 2006, Eurostat and the ECB
started publishing quarterly non-financial and financial data for the general
government of the euro area and EU-25, as well as most member states. Around the
same time, they started publishing the underlying government sector accounts for EU
member states. These accounts present the various fiscal data in an integrated
framework, link them explicitly with the EDP budget balance, and provide stock-flow
adjustments, thus allowing the relationship between budgetary outcomes and changes
in government debt to be reconciled and tracked. In addition, Eurostat has stepped up
its monitoring of member states’ fiscal accounts, in part through more in-depth visits
(EDP Dialogue Visits and Methodological Visits), and publishes the results on its
website. To allow this stepped-up monitoring, Eurostat’s resources allocated to fiscal
accounts have been increased and a second internal unit was established. However,
many of the new positions remain to be filled, the new structure is not yet fully
operational, and the resource increase merely corrects for the loss of resources that
had occurred on a per-country basis due to EU enlargement.
•

The availability of labor market statistics has improved further in 2005 and all EU
Member States are now collecting data for the continuous quarterly Labor Force
Survey. Eurostat has also started publishing an improved detailed labor cost index
and new national accounts-based quarterly employment data. Work is ongoing to
establish a euro area series on job vacancies.

•

As elsewhere, the accuracy and international comparability of EU labor productivity
statistics are hampered by difficulties in measuring hours worked, which has become
more difficult with the proliferation of non-standard labor contracts, and productivity
in services. Statistics on euro area and US productivity levels are also not fully
comparable due to methodological differences in the calculation of GDP, including
different approaches in making quality adjustments and recording military spending.

•

Efforts to harmonize and improve consumer price statistics continue, including
through the recent harmonization of the HICP index reference period and the
upcoming harmonization of the length of the price collection period. Going forward,
the main priorities are quality adjustments, which are being studied on a case-by-case
basis, and owner-occupied housing. Although the eventual objective is to construct a
“net-acquisition” index for housing (i.e., an index of the purchase price of new
dwellings, excluding the cost of land), an “all dwellings” index will be constructed
first. Publication of the index is envisaged, but no decision has been made on any
possible incorporation in the HICP. A pilot project is ongoing to construct an HICP at
constant tax rates. During 2005, Eurostat formulated a recommendation on the
statistical treatment of the Dutch health care reform, which will constitute a basis for
future cases.

•

Despite various initiatives, asymmetries in the intra-EU trade data reported by the
different member states are growing, reflecting mounting difficulties in tracking trade
flows and financial transactions. Asymmetries in the latter in particular have been
increasing and tend to be more volatile. The asymmetries create difficulties in
measuring the EU and the euro area’s external trade, domestic demand, level of GDP,

48
and household savings rates, among other variables. New efforts to reduce them
include work Eurostat is planning to undertake with selected pairs of high-asymmetry
countries. Eurostat is also working on increasing the transparency of the transition
from statistics on trade in goods (based on data produced by customs administrations
and national statistical institutes) to data related to “goods” in BoP statistics
(compiled by central banks). A reconciliation table will be part of the future EU
quality reports to be compiled by each member state.
•

A limited set of macroprudential indicators for the euro area is published in the fall
issue of the ECB’s Financial Stability Report (Table 2). All euro area countries are
participating in the Coordinated Compilation Exercise for Financial Soundness
Indicators, but the ECB’s consolidation approach and frequency of compilation differ
from the Fund’s Compilation Guide on FSIs. No harmonized and aggregated highfrequency housing market indicators (prices, housing starts) exist.

•

Work to improve the Principal Economic Indicators for the euro area continues, with
a focus on the coordination of release and revision policies, on seasonal and working
day adjustments, and on harmonization more generally. Eurostat publishes a range of
structural indicators to support the Lisbon-strategy. These structural indicators have
not yet been adapted to the 2005 revamp of the Lisbon strategy, but a decision on this
may be made by end-2006. The publication of the euro area accounts per institutional
sector made a number of indicators of corporate sector profitability available, notably
net operating surplus. However, no timely quarterly or half-yearly indicators of
corporate sector profitability exist. Later this year, Eurostat plans to start publishing
detailed import prices at the 2-digit NACE level, covering imports coming from
outside the area.

•

Eurostat and the ECB expect no major problems from the expansion of the euro area
with new member states, since statistics for these countries are already collected.
However, the compilation of backward statistical series for the expanded euro area
may have to rely to some extent on estimations and will be especially challenging for
pre-1995 data.

Appendix II. EU Policies Staff Research, 2003–05
Monetary Policy and Inflation
“Measures of Underlying Inflation In The Euro Area: Assessment and Role for Informing
Monetary Policy” (Emil Stavrev, 2006 Selected Issues)
•

Proposes indicators of underlying inflation (beyond the standard “core” measures),
finding that this is presently running between 1½ and 2¼ percent, with most measures
suggesting a figure below 2 percent. Examines a suite of inflation forecasting models,
comparing their performances, and combining them to provide a quantitative view on
the baseline outlook for inflation as well as the balance of risks. Projects that
inflation, presently running around 2½ percent, is set to decline to around 2 percent
during 2007 and that the risks are roughly balanced.

“Declining Money Velocity in the Euro Area: Implications for the ECB’s Monetary
Analysis,” (Hamid Faruqee, 2005, Selected Issues).
•

Shows that the nexus between inflation and money growth is more reliable over
longer horizons; that velocity has experienced a variable rate of decline, challenging a
robust assessment of liquidity; and that strengthening the monetary cross-check
entails further disentangling the factors behind changing liquidity preferences.

“House Prices and Monetary Policy in the Euro Area,” (Anthony Annett, 2005, Selected
Issues).
•

Shows that the relationship between credit growth and house prices depends on
country-specific institutional characteristics; and that house prices do not seem to
forecast consumer price inflation over the short- to medium term.

“Is Inflation Persistence Higher in the Euro Area than in the United States?” (Mads Kieler,
2003, Selected Issues).
•

Analyzes inflation persistence on both sides of the Atlantic; shows that it declined
significantly in the mid-1990s, and is only moderately higher in the euro area (a break
with the past).

Fiscal Policy
“Enforcement and the Stability and Growth Pact: How Fiscal Policy Did and Did Not
Change Under Europe’s Fiscal Framework,” (Anthony Annett, 2006; Working Paper and
Selected Issues).

50
•

Argues that the SGP is more suited to countries that are smaller, subject to greater
macroeconomic volatility, and that use a “commitment”—or more rules-based—form
of fiscal governance (as opposed to “delegation,” which relies on a strong agenda
setter such as a finance minister); and that most of the new members share these
characteristics. For the other countries, domestic governance reforms would improve
the operation of the Pact.

“Reforming the Stability and Growth Pact,” (Anthony Annett, Jörg Decressin, and Michael
Deppler, 2005, Policy Discussion Paper).
•

Explains the benefits of rules-based fiscal policy for Europe. Reviews the history of
fiscal policy under the SGP, emphasizing weaknesses, notably lack of adjustment
during good times. Argues that the SGP can be strengthened by letting the Excessive
Deficit Procedure focus on policies rather than outcomes, and by fostering timeconsistent national policies, transparency, and ownership through stronger national
governance institutions.

“Boom-Bust Phases in Asset Prices and Fiscal Policy Behavior,” (Albert Jaeger and Ludger
Schuknecht, 2004, Working Paper).
•

Argues that output gap and revenue elasticity estimates are highly uncertain during
boom-bust cycles, making estimates of fiscal positions difficult; and that these cycles
exacerbate procyclical loosening and deficit biases.

Structural Reforms
“Case studies and Beyond: Lessons from Successful Labor Market Reformers in Europe and
Implications for its Social Model” (Tony Annett, 2006, Selected Issues)
•

Using both case studies (from Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, and the United
Kingdom) and wider empirical evidence, finds that more decisive reform progress is
less a matter of social choices than of sticking to a forward-looking strategy, pursuing
functionally and intertemporally consistent and complementary fiscal and structural
policies over many years. Successful fiscal adjustment mainly centered on welfare
reform and the government wage bill, using the ensuing labor supply and related
revenue improvements to cut taxes and maintain the reform momentum. These steps
were complemented by actions that enhanced both factor and product (goods and
services) market flexibility, enabled a stronger translation of wage moderation into
jobs, and increased real incomes rather than rents. Importantly, reforms along these
lines also proved to be compatible with broadly stable income distributions.

51
“Product Market Regulation and the Benefits of Wage Moderation,” (Marcello Estevão,
2005, Working Paper and Selected Issues).
•

Argues that the effectiveness of wage moderation in terms of raising output and
employment depends on the degree of product market regulation and that the euro
area, because of overly regulated markets, has been lagging in this regard.

“Why is Productivity Growth in the Euro Area So Sluggish?” (Marcello Estevão, 2004,
Working Paper and Selected Issues).
•

Argues that wage moderation and some progress on structural reforms induced firms
to shift to more labor-intensive production, reversing earlier substitution toward
capital; and that the euro area did not enjoy a productivity surge in ICT-using
services, especially wholesale and retail trade and financial intermediation.

“Implementing Lisbon: Incentives and Constraints,” (Xavier Debrun and Anthony Annett,
2004, Selected Issues).
•

Argues that EU countries exhibit strong status quo bias; that product market reform
spurs labor market reform as rents fall; that cross-border spillovers affect reforms;
and that the open method of coordination remains viable, but could be improved by
streamlining and relying more on “naming and shaming.”

Financial Sector
“How Good Is Financial Sector Regulation and Supervision in Europe?” (Martin Čihák and
Alexander Tieman, 2006, Selected Issues)
•

Based on a detailed analysis of information from Financial Sector Assessment
Program missions (FSAPs) for EU countries, concludes that even though the EU
supervisory systems are of a higher and more even quality than those of comparable
non-EU countries, there are still notable gaps between the EU practices and the
international standards. Highlights an issue raised by most FSAPs in the EU: the need
to adjust the supervisory frameworks to meet new challenges, in particular evolving
international financial integration. Notes that a fuller assessment of EU-wide
regulatory and supervisory framework issues is difficult on the basis of country
FSAPs.

“A Bank Business Correlation Perspective on Pan-European Supervision” (Jörg Decressin,
2006, Selected Issues)
•

Finds that developments in balance sheet and profitability indicators of Europe’s 100
largest banks do not cluster naturally around countries. From various perspectives, the
EU-wide dynamics in these indicators appear as important as the country-specific

52
dynamics. Hence, detecting potential risks and vulnerabilities in national financial
systems and resolving instabilities are likely to require a strong cross-border
perspective.
“The Integration of European Financial Markets,” (Francois Haas, 2005, Selected Issues).
•

Reviews the state of European financial market integration, pointing to remaining
obstacles in retail markets, collateral-based instruments, and financial infrastructure
(notably payments and securities clearing and settlement systems).

“European Financial Integration, Stability, and Supervision,” (Gianni De Nicolo, Robert
Corker, Alexander Tieman, and Jan-Willem van der Vossen, 2005, Selected Issues).
•

Explores the impact of financial integration on system-wide risk profiles of publiclytraded European financial institutions; finds that risk profiles have converged, but not
to lower risk levels. Notes that the challenge is to align incentives of supervisory
bodies and to improve coordination.

“Banks and Markets in Europe and the United States,” (Jörg Decressin and Beata Kudela,
2005, Selected Issues).
•

Reviews the history of EU and US financial integration, showing that the European
financial system offers less scope for banks and markets to leverage their comparative
advantage (with, for example, far less securitization than in the United States). As a
result, EU banks seem to underperform relative to US banks, although they appear to
operate in a less competitive environment.

Trade Policy and International Spillovers
“EU Eastern Enlargement: Impact on Trade and FDI,” (Jean-Jacques Hallaert, 2003, Selected
Issues).
•

Argues that trade and investment links between old and new EU members will
deepen, with enlargement providing stimulus to intra-industry trade; that new
members have most to gain, and that impact on third-country trade and investment
will be limited.

“Measuring the Trade Effects of EMU,” (Hamid Faruqee, 2004, Working Paper).
•

Shows that monetary union boosted trade among member states by roughly
10 percent during the euro’s existence, and that trade gains do not come at the
expense of extra-area trade. Dynamic effects of EMU on trade integration rise over
time.

53
“Global Rebalancing of Current Accounts: A Euro-Area Perspective,” (Hamid Faruqee,
2004, Selected Issues).
•

Shows that a benign global rebalancing would be compatible with boosting domestic
demand and potential growth in partner countries relative to the United States, while
an adjustment scenario based primarily on exchange rate adjustment would be more
challenging, especially with limited exchange rate flexibility in the rest of the world.

“The Changing Patterns of EU-China Trade,” (Jean-Jacques Hallaert, 2004, Selected Issues).
•

Describes recent growth of EU-China trade, including composition (growth in
electronics exports from China, as well as textiles and clothing).

“Exchange Rate Pass-Through in the Euro Area: The Role of Asymmetric Pricing Behavior,”
(Hamid Faruqee, 2005, Working Paper and Selected Issues).
•

Shows that area-wide prices display incomplete pass-through, consistent with euro
currency-pricing and pricing-to-market behavior; as with the United States,
“expenditure-switching” effects on the current account still operate but are generally
small; and that given small effects on the trade balance, substantial exchange rate
adjustment may be needed for moderate external adjustment.

Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European Department
Approved by Michael Deppler and Adnan Mazarei
July 25, 2006
1.
This supplement provides an update of economic and policy developments since
the release of the Euro Area Policies staff report. The thrust of the staff appraisal remains
unchanged.
2.

New data are broadly in line with staff forecasts:

•

Revised national accounts data show that domestic demand and net exports in the
first quarter were stronger than originally reported, mainly on account of investment
and exports. Consumption growth, which has been volatile, reached 2.4 percent
following 0.4 percent in 2005:Q4.

•

Various recently-released indicators confirm that activity in 2006:Q2 is strong and
that near-term risks are on the upside. The euro area industrial new orders index
increased by 2.3 percent in May 2006, while that for production grew by 1.6 percent,
following smaller declines during previous months. Car sales were strong but retail
trade volumes fell by 0.6 percent in May and thus continue to move broadly sideways
since fall 2005. Both the manufacturing and the services PMI indicator inched up
again, reaching the highest levels since summer 2000. National indicators generally
increased but a few lead indicators have retreated albeit from very high levels.

•

Financial market participants generally expect quarterly real GDP growth of around
0.6-0.8 percent in 2006:Q2 and Q3. Staff’s latest forecasts and those of the
Commission are at the lower end of this interval.

3.
Headline inflation remained stable at 2.5 percent in June. There is no evidence of
acceleration in underlying price pressures, including wages, which stood 2.1-2.2 percent
above last year’s level in 2006:Q1, notwithstanding a further small decline in the
unemployment rate, to 7.9 percent in May. Oil prices are running somewhat above US$70

per barrel, the price underlying staff projections for 2007.1 Inflation expectations have
remained broadly unchanged and monetary and credit growth strong.
4.
At its July 6 meeting, the ECB left interest rates unchanged but gave indications
that led market participants to expect an interest rate increase on August 3. The ECB
statement said that the Governing Council will exercise “strong vigilance,” which is widely
interpreted as a pre-announcement of a rate hike. An August rate hike would represent an
acceleration relative to the once-a-quarter tightening pace followed thus far. Market see rates
at 3½ percent by end-year.
5.
Financial integration is proceeding. Regarding securities clearing and settlement,
the Commission has opted against legislative action at this stage but called on market
participants to put in place a code of practice to achieve integration that would contain
specific objectives and deadlines so that progress could be monitored by the Commission.
The ECB has announced that it is examining the possibility of providing a cross-border
securities settlement system. Meanwhile, the Commission’s Competition Directorate has
published an interim report that shows that European retail banking markets remain highly
fragmented and characterized by a range of entry barriers. The report is intended for
consultation and no enforcement or policy actions are expected in the near future.

An increase by 10 percent per barrel would add 0.1 percent to inflation, according to staff estimates.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Discusses Euro Area Policies
On July 26, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the discussion of euro area policies.1
Background
After several years of disappointment, growth has picked up and broadened.
Notwithstanding significant quarterly volatility, real GDP, final domestic demand, and
household consumption all grew between 1¾-2 percent in the year through 2006: Q1
and the recovery has been gaining some traction in weaker parts of the area.
Nonetheless, the pick up in activity remains fragile, relying on strong global growth.
Employment and consumption continue to lag.
Monetary conditions remain accommodative, notwithstanding the policy rate hikes since
December 2005, and external demand is strong. The area’s external current account is
broadly balanced and the exchange rate, while having appreciated somewhat lately,
remains below the highs reached in 2004. Nonetheless, the area remains exposed to a
disorderly resolution of global imbalances.
Besides supportive external demand and financial conditions the recovery reflects in
part improved fundamentals in the corporate sector. Nonfinancial corporate profitability
has been strong and leverage has been brought under control. Market-based financing
activities have begun to recover from recent lows and, thus far, are not expected to be
set back significantly by the latest market turbulence. Bank-based borrowing, which
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions
with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and
financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments
and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the
basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion,
the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

picked up more than a year ago, remains robust. While enterprise loans have largely
funded restructuring and consolidation, lending surveys now indicate that capital
expenditures are no longer a drag. Financial sector indicators also point to improving
positions. Many banks are well capitalized and booking record profits, buoyed by low
interest rates, low costs of risk, cost containment, and booming demand for mortgage
loans.
Price pressures appear contained despite sharply rising oil and administrative prices.
Headline HICP inflation reached 2.5 percent in May and is likely to stay above 2 percent
for some time due to energy prices, further administered price hikes, and the expected
VAT increase in Germany in 2007. However, core inflation is running around
1½ percent, reflecting limited indirect effects and absent second-round effects.
Services price inflation is easing.
Although improving in 2005, public finances remain at a significant distance from close
to balance or surplus, the area’s medium-term fiscal objective given the looming
demographic shock. Five countries are close to or above the Stability and Growth Pact’s
3 percent of GDP limit. Moreover, absent further measures little improvement is
expected for 2006-07.
Area productivity growth has been disappointing and the population is expected to begin
to decline around 2010. Against this background, staff foresees actual growth around
2 percent in 2006-07. The balance of risks lies somewhat to the upside in the near term
but to the downside beyond 2006.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors welcomed the broadening and strengthening of the recovery in the euro area,
supported by accommodative financial conditions and strong global growth, restored
business confidence, and improved financial positions. Price pressures have been
contained notwithstanding sharply rising oil and administrative prices. Directors were
also encouraged that the reformed Stability and Growth Pact is regaining traction over
fiscal policies, and welcomed the better-than-originally projected fiscal outcomes for
2005. Equally, they welcomed the ongoing progress with the reform of product and
services markets and financial integration.
Looking ahead, Directors considered the balance of risks in 2006 to be on the upside,
but for 2007 and beyond, however, they saw the risks tilting to the downside.
In particular, they noted that the recovery of employment and consumption has yet to be
firmly established, productivity growth continues to be sluggish, oil prices are volatile,
and global imbalances remain unresolved. In light of these considerations, and more
fundamentally reflecting the sluggish growth performance of the past few years and the
looming demographic shock, Directors underscored the need for accelerated fiscal
consolidation and further structural reforms that aim at strengthening incentives to work
and invest.

3
Directors commended the deliberate pace of monetary withdrawal in the face of large
exogenous price shocks that continued to keep the headline inflation above the ECB
target, considering it in line with the ECB's mandate. Many Directors observed that
inflationary expectations remain well anchored, wage growth is subdued, signs of
second-round effects from oil and administrative price hikes are absent, and inflation is
projected to ease over the next two years. Accordingly, these Directors generally saw a
need for caution in raising rates further until a more balanced recovery takes firm hold.
Several other Directors saw the timing of further tightening as unclear, but some
Directors were more concerned about the upside risks to inflation, and urged the
authorities to monitor developments closely and respond flexibly with a view to keeping
inflation expectations well anchored.
On the structural front, Directors agreed that significant progress has been made over
the years, as evidenced by the buoyancy of employment over the past decade.
Nonetheless, much remains to be done as regards both labor utilization and
productivity. Steadfast pursuit of mutually reinforcing fiscal and structural policies
continues to be essential to strengthen growth and stimulate employment, prepare for
aging, and facilitate the orderly unwinding of global imbalances.
In this regard, Directors thought that the key fiscal challenge is to achieve broadly
balanced fiscal positions by 2010, when the area’s population is projected to begin
declining. Notwithstanding the recent improvements, however, Directors remained
concerned about prospects for achieving the necessary adjustment toward balance
during the upswing. They, therefore, encouraged countries to press ahead with fiscal
consolidation. Countries at some distance from underlying balance need to identify
measures equivalent to at least ½ percent of GDP annual adjustment over the coming
years, focused on the expenditure side. Indeed, given the soft nature of the Pact’s
preventive arm, many Directors reckoned that the Pact could usefully be buttressed at
the country level by strengthening non-partisan national governance mechanisms that
spell out the implications of policies in a forward looking manner.
Directors pointed to the integrated National Reform Programs under the reformed
Lisbon process as useful platforms for fostering ownership and carrying forward national
product and labor market reforms. They observed that reforms that raise labor utilization
continue to be paramount but that policies also need to devote more attention to
boosting productivity, not just through R&D spending, but also by intensifying
competition, especially in the services sector.
Directors welcomed the progress in integrating Europe’s financial markets. However,
with the area’s lagging productivity, rooted in good part in the financial sector, policies
need to become more proactive in removing the many remaining cross-border barriers
to integration. This would require a forceful competition policy and public intervention in
areas in which stakeholders stymie the establishment of open, market-based solutions.
Directors welcomed the latest initiatives to strengthen crossborder collaboration among
prudential authorities but thought that further integration of supervision over complex
groups would be necessary to improve the effectiveness of area-wide prudential policies
and crisis management. Directors welcomed the new Directive on AML/CFT and looked
forward to its full implementation.

4

Directors also stressed the role of trade liberalization in boosting productivity.
Expressing disappointment about the recent developments in the Doha round, they
noted an urgent need to reconsider entrenched positions, and called for resistance to
the temptation to resort to undisciplined bilateralism. For its part, the EU should
endeavor to achieve the effective liberalization of agricultural market access. Several
Directors also commended the EU’s ambitious Aid for Trade agenda.
While the external position of the euro area is broadly balanced and the euro is seen as
falling within a fairly-valued range from a medium-run multilateral perspective, most
Directors noted that growth-enhancing structural reform is needed to limit downside risks
to the euro area and facilitate orderly adjustment to global imbalances. While this could
be achieved through a variety of measures, the most effective in the current context
appear to be steps to strengthen competition in the services sector, which, besides
boosting productivity, would help accelerate growth and demand. In this context,
Directors welcomed the authorities’ acknowledgment that reducing global imbalances is
a shared responsibility, and welcomed their commitment to contribute to this outcome
through enhanced structural reform.

Statement by Tuomas Saarenheimo, Executive Director for Euro Area
July 26, 2006
Since July 1st, Finland has been holding the Presidency of the euro area. I therefore have the
honor of giving this statement reflecting the common view of the euro-area Member States
and the European Community in their respective fields of competence.
The authorities of the euro-area Member States welcome the IMF Staff's assessment of
economic developments and prospects in the euro area. While the authorities broadly concur
with the findings of the IMF, on some issues views differ, as outlined below in this
statement. I will also update the Board on recent economic developments.
Short-term economic outlook
Since the beginning of the year, the euro-area economy has returned to a robust growth path.
Domestic demand has been picking up and GDP has been growing above potential in the first
quarter. Private consumption has shown clear signs of recovery and made a strong
contribution to economic growth. This reflected strengthening household confidence and a
gradual firming of the labor market. Moreover, the underlying momentum of private
investment growth remains strong despite somewhat subdued construction activity in the first
months of the year resulting from poor weather conditions. Finally, the euro area continued
to benefit from robust global demand, resulting in a positive contribution from net trade to
growth.
The strengthening of domestic demand in the euro area has been awaited for some time.
According to survey or "soft" data, consumer and business confidence have already been on a
steady increase since the second half of 2005 and lie well above the low levels recorded in
2002 and 2003. It is a fact that it has taken longer than usual for the "hard" economic data to
reflect the higher confidence of households and businesses. Statistical factors have certainly
played a role here. But given the strong performance in the first quarter, hard data are now
starting to trail the upward trend in the soft data, and business and consumer confidence has
continued improving in recent months.
Nevertheless, there are also downside risks to growth among which the most important stem
from higher energy prices, a possible disorderly correction of global imbalances, or pressure
for increased protectionism. Finally, the recent turbulence on global financial markets is an
additional source of uncertainty, especially in the light of these global imbalances. At this
stage there is no reason to be overly worried about the consequences of this turbulence for
the euro area: the effects have been largely confined to equity markets and financial markets
in emerging market economies and some correction in stock markets may have been
necessary in the light of earlier exuberance. Nevertheless, these developments should be kept
under close review.

2
The euro-area authorities share the staff's view that real GDP growth is to remain around 2%
in the baseline scenario in 2006 and 2007. Moreover, there is agreement that the risks to
growth seem to be tilted to the upside in the near term and that the risks to growth start to
weigh on the downside in 2007. However, while the euro-area authorities see a gradual
strengthening of domestic demand (and its contribution to 2006 and 2007 growth should
remain larger than external demand), the IMF staff sees a continued strong dependence of the
euro area on external demand. As a result, the staff seems to be more concerned about the
balance of risks to growth in 2007.
Monetary policy

The euro area authorities welcome the assessment by the IMF staff that the recent increases
in the ECB’s key interest rates, which reached 2.75% in June 2006, were warranted. The
ECB also agrees with the staff that, after these increases, the ECB’s monetary policy stance
still remains accommodative. However, the ECB disagrees with some of the conclusions
contained in the staff report, notably as regards the view expressed on the outlook for risks to
price stability over the medium term and, consequently, the appropriate orientation of the
monetary policy stance going forward in order to contain such risks. Specifically, the staff
argues that the ECB should wait for a broadening of the upswing or signs of accelerating
underlying price pressures before further withdrawing accommodation, since they regard the
recovery in the euro area as still fragile and not sufficiently broad-based and consider risks to
price stability to be relatively balanced over the medium term. In this context, it should be
recalled that, consistent with its mandate, the ECB’s primary objective is to maintain price
stability in the euro area, and that price stability is defined on the basis of headline inflation,
rather than using measures of so-called core inflation emphasised by the IMF staff.
The assessment of the ECB’s Governing Council is that upside risks to price stability over
the medium term continue to prevail. The Governing Council also considers that economic
activity in the euro area accelerated and became more broadly based in the first half of 2006,
with economic growth projected to continue at rates around potential on a sustained basis,
although downside risks to the growth outlook do exist over longer horizons.
As regards the Governing Council’s assessment of risks to price stability on the basis of the
economic analysis, oil price rises in particular have brought annual HICP inflation rates to
levels above 2%, levels that have now persisted over several quarters. Inflation rates are
likely to remain above 2% during the second half of 2006 and, on average, in 2007. While
the moderate evolution of labour costs in the euro area is expected to continue in 2007, the
indirect effects of past oil price increases and changes already announced in indirect taxes are
expected to exert a significant upward effect on inflation in the course of next year. Over the
medium term, risks to price stability are clearly on the upside and include: further increases
in oil prices; a stronger than expected pass-through of oil price rises to consumer prices;
additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes; and, more fundamentally,
stronger than expected wage and price developments owing to second-round effects of past
oil price increases.

3
The ECB’s monetary analysis provides further insight into inflation prospects over medium
to longer-term horizons. Monetary developments point to increased upside risks to price
stability at these horizons and therefore require enhanced monitoring. In an environment of
already ample liquidity, money and credit growth have strengthened further over recent
quarters, reaching, in terms of annual growth, the highest rates observed since the
introduction of the euro – and in fact, the highest rates since the early 1990s. Loans to the
private sector have been expanding at double-digit rates and have become broadly based
across sectors, with borrowing both by households (in particular for house purchase) and by
non-financial corporations rising more strongly. These developments confirm the stimulative
impact that the low level of interest rates in the euro area is having on money and credit
expansion. They also emphasise the need to closely monitor price dynamics in a number of
housing markets.
Cross-checking the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis
supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium term. On
this basis, the Governing Council of the ECB reached the conclusion that a progressive
withdrawal of monetary accommodation remains warranted. The continued solid anchoring
of inflation expectations in the euro area at levels consistent with price stability requires that
the markets and the public be firmly assured that the ECB will act in a timely manner to
ensure that risks to price stability do not materialise. In turn, the continued solid anchoring of
inflation expectations is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution
towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area.

Fiscal developments and fiscal policy
The euro-area authorities share the staff's view that there are important fiscal challenges for
the euro area. First, the average debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 70% and 7 out of 12 Member
States have debt levels above the 60% reference value of the Treaty. Second, the population
of the euro area is ageing. This will put further pressure on public finances by significantly
lowering the euro area's growth potential and by substantially raising ageing-related
expenditures. Progress has nevertheless been made towards securing more sustainable public
finances in many member states, not least with respect to pension reform.
In this context, the staff's positive overall assessment of the reformed Stability and Growth
Pact is welcomed. Authorities agree that the first year of the application of the reformed
Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) can be judged positive. While remaining a rules-based
system, the reformed SGP has stimulated a constructive and transparent economic policy
dialogue. The reformed Pact resulted in more national ownership of the budgetary rules as a
result of a stronger economic rationale which ensures that economic differences between
countries are better taken into account. Budgetary adjustment in the EU has resumed and
budgetary positions in 2005 have improved in structural terms by 0.8% of GDP in the euro
area.

4
Although these developments warrant some optimism on the future implementation of the
SGP, euro-area authorities agree with the staff that further progress needs to be made to
ensure compliance with the ‘preventive arm’ of the Pact which governs the attainment of
sound budgetary balances in the medium-term. The long-term fiscal sustainability challenges
stemming from ageing populations should be at the heart of policy making.
Budgetary authorities are committed to making use of the positive budgetary developments
in 2005 and the benign economic outlook to speed up the pace of deficit and debt reduction
so as to reach their medium-term objective. Taking advantage of the current window of
opportunity to improve the budgetary position will contribute to a better policy mix with
possibly lower long-term interest rates than otherwise. It will also create more room for
manoeuvre in the next downswing and contribute to reducing debt levels significantly before
the budgetary effects of ageing set in.
On the staff's suggestion that fiscal governance mechanisms at the national level could
possibly contribute towards a more forward-looking approach to budgetary policy, euro-area
authorities agree that well-designed national fiscal rules and institutions may facilitate
budgetary consolidation strategies as well as help avoiding pro-cyclical policies.
Structural policies
The euro-area authorities welcome the staff's positive recognition of the progress made in the
area of structural reform, regarding both the new organisation of the Lisbon process and the
reforms that so far have been implemented. The new process, including National Reform
Programmes, has indeed contributed to improve national ownership of – and support for –
the objectives of the Lisbon agenda. Moreover, national parliaments and social partners have
started to become more involved in the process. Further improvements in the governance of
the Lisbon process are under way. The Commission and the Member States are now in the
process of developing a methodology with which the progress made in implementing the
proposed measures can be assessed.
The structural reforms undertaken so far have had positive effects. Active labor market
policies, mainly focusing on the labor supply side, have contributed to employment growth.
Indeed, the employment rate in the euro area has risen significantly since the turn of the
century. Pensions systems and social security systems are being reformed. Progress is being
made in improving the Internal Market's legal and regulatory framework and in reducing
administrative burdens. Finally, all Member States have been reforming their product
markets to enhance the business environment and stimulate entrepreneurship.
Despite the progress that is being made – job creation has improved and it is comparable to
that of the US in boom times – , much remains to be done to reach the Lisbon objective for
the participation rates and to increase the flexibility needed to enhance the efficiency of
adjustment mechanisms in the euro area. Labor market reform must indeed continue to be

5
paramount in the reform programmes of the euro-area Member States . The euro-area's recent
performance with respect to labor productivity growth, which in the light of an ageing euroarea population will become an essential source for economic growth in the long run, has
been disappointing. Labor productivity growth has been on a secular declining trend and in
the past decade it has been below US productivity growth. The staff therefore rightly points
out that the reform programmes need to devote more attention to boosting productivity. In
the light of an ageing euro-area population, however, productivity growth will become
essential for economic growth in the long run.
Productivity strengthening is most necessary in the services sector which accounts for 70%
of the euro-area's current economic activity and which has low overall productivity growth.
This low productivity growth in the services sector seems related to the insufficient
exploitation of ICT. But there also appears to be a link to the lack of competition in some
services sectors, with the latter reflecting the limited tradability of many services, the
extensive domestic regulation and the lack of a fully integrated single market for services in
the euro area. Therefore, policy measures are needed that increase competition in, and
integration of, the euro-area services markets, favour the spread of new technologies and
enhance human capital. The euro-area authorities agree with the staff's assessment that
stronger competition in the services sector – by means of boosting productivity – would help
to accelerate growth and demand, thereby facilitating an orderly adjustment to global
imbalances and limiting downside risks to the euro area. In this light the Services Directive is
a step in the right direction and the euro-area authorities are committed to ensure full and
rapid implementation.
Financial sector issues
The euro-area authorities share the staff's positive assessment of the health of the euro-area
financial sector. The performance and soundness of the sector has been improving for several
years and is likely to strengthen further in line with the recovery in the real economy.
Nevertheless, significant risks to the financial sector persist and continued vigilance is
required on the part of policymakers. While these risks have a global dimension, their
implications will vary among euro-area Member States depending on local economic and
financial conditions. In this context, the staff has drawn attention to these differences and
highlighted the specific risks facing those Member States where house prices and/or
household debt have risen sharply. While there is no evidence of a major risk to economic
growth or financial stability in the Member States concerned, developments are being
monitored carefully at both the national and euro-area level.
The euro-area authorities agree that financial sector integration would bring about important
area-wide productivity gains. On these grounds, financial integration has become one of the
key elements of the EU strategy for economic reform. While it is understandable that the
staff should express concern about the measured pace of integration, it must be recognized
that the integration of so many national financial systems is a highly complex operation. In

6
this context, it is important that deadlines in the integration process are realistic, if suboptimal outcomes are to be avoided. Moreover, one should not underestimate the extent of
progress that has already been achieved. For example, money markets, government bond
markets and derivatives markets in the euro area are now either unified or substantially more
integrated than it was the case before the introduction of the euro in 1999, while the
corporate bond market and the market for investment funds have grown rapidly. In light of
the progress achieved, we find the staff assessment of progress in financial integration (para.
26) somewhat unbalanced.
The process of financial integration is set to intensify in the coming years, as a common
regulatory framework largely is progressively put in place through implementation of the
Financial Services Action Plan. The FSAP is now implemented at the EU level and Member
States are in the process of transposing the various legislative elements into their national
laws. The Lamfalussy framework will assist in this process by helping to deliver consistent
implementation across Member States. While a degree of discretion in transposition has been
left to the Member States, the description of the FSAP and Lamfalussy process by the staff as
being captured by vested interests (para. 26, second bullet) seems exaggerated.
Despite the progress achieved, the staff rightly draws attention to several important areas
where efforts to promote integration must be stepped up, notably clearing and settlement
arrangements and cross-border consolidation in banking. The obstacles to integration in both
of these areas have been identified and analyzed, and appropriate policy reforms will be
announced soon. The Staff also highlights the financial stability framework and is concerned
that current arrangements for oversight of cross-border transactions may not be adequate to
the task. Although much improved in recent years, the arrangements for cross-border
supervision - from both efficiency and stability perspectives - have been identified as
priorities for action in EU financial services policy for the period 2005-2010. A series of
pragmatic initiatives – such as mediation, delegation, harmonized reporting etc. – have
already been proposed and clear deadlines for delivery have been set by the Council. In this
context, the so-called level-3 committees in the Lamfalussy framework will play an essential
role in fostering the necessary convergence in supervisory practices and procedures. At the
same time work to further refine arrangements for financial crisis prevention and
management is ongoing. In April 2006, a crisis management exercise was organized
involving all relevant players at EU level. On the basis of the experience with this exercise,
further priorities will be set aiming at further improving the current framework.
Euro area integration
We do not share the staff's assessment concerning EU integration (see paragraph 28), in
particular that the euro area is not open. Indeed, on 11 July 2006, the euro area welcomed
Slovenia as new member and remains open to all EU member states fulfilling the criteria as
defined in the Treaty. More broadly, we agree that the integration of labour, product and

7
financial markets in the euro area need to be deepened further to enhance their flexibility to
adjust to economic shocks.
International economic relations
Like the IMF staff, the euro-area authorities regret the insufficient political readiness in some
countries to come to a successful and timely conclusion of the Doha Development Agenda.
The European Union has taken the lead in all areas of the negotiations, including in
agriculture where the EU made substantive proposals on market access, reduction of
domestic support and where it committed to eliminate its export subsidies by 2013. The EU
offer in agriculture would create significant new export opportunities for third countries into
European markets. Moreover, the EU would have been ready to improve its offer. However,
this would have needed to be concurrently reciprocated by the United States in the field of
domestic support and by the emerging market economies as regards industrial market access
and services.
The authorities also share the staff's concern that the proliferation of bilateral and plurilateral
free and regional trade arrangements could contribute to undermining the multilateral fabric
of world trade. However, it should be added that one-sided restraint in Europe is no option,
given the growing concern within the euro area about loss of global market share and the
recent bilateral deals signed between other major trading blocs.
Finally, the staff's positive assessment of the EU's Aid for Trade and Economic Partnership
Agreements is welcomed as the EU's recent efforts in these areas have indeed been ambitious
and successful.
