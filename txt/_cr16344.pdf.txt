IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Bulgaria
On November 4, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Bulgaria.1
The Bulgarian economy has been resilient to multiple shocks in recent years and macroeconomic
developments have been encouraging. The economy is expected to grow 3.3 percent this year
and around 2.5 percent in the medium term. Deflation has recently showed signs of gradual
easing, supported by decelerating energy price declines and a pick-up in food prices.
Fiscal consolidation is advancing faster than anticipated. Driven by administrative revenue
measures, stronger economic activity, and under-execution of EU-funded capital spending, the
cash fiscal deficit is projected to decline to around 0.7 percent of GDP—or lower—in 2016.
Looking ahead, the main threats to the fiscal accounts are posed by poor performance of stateowned enterprises (SOEs), weak finances of subnational governments, and concerns regarding
the viability of Pillar 2 private pension funds. Over the long run, the projected aging of, and
decline in, Bulgaria’s population will likely lead to significant fiscal pressures.
Gaps in banking supervision and resolution are being addressed. In August, the Bulgarian
National Bank completed an assessment of the banking system, consisting of an asset quality
review (AQR) and stress test. The results showed that most banks were well-capitalized but
three banks—the largest domestically-owned bank and two small ones—had to restore the
coverage of their capital buffers. One bank has raised needed capital and the other two have
submitted plans to achieve the capital target by mid-2017. A Financial Sector Assessment
Program is being undertaken by the IMF and the World Bank and will provide a more in-depth
assessment of the financial sector.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
Adverse investment, population, and productivity developments have weighed on Bulgaria’s
growth potential since the global financial crisis. With slow convergence, the country’s per
capita income (on a purchasing power parity basis) remains less than half of the EU average.
Persistent concerns regarding the rule of law and corruption add to challenges and undermine the
business environment. In addition, many SOEs in infrastructure sectors have become bottlenecks
that inhibit growth and productivity.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted that the Bulgarian economy has been resilient to shocks in recent
years. Macroeconomic developments have been encouraging with output growing at a steady
pace, unemployment at its lowest level in seven years, and deflation showing signs of gradual
easing. Directors noted that growth is expected to moderate in the medium term and remain
below the levels needed to accelerate income convergence to the EU average. While agreeing
that risks to the outlook were balanced, they called for continued efforts to safeguard financial
stability, raise potential growth, and address long-term fiscal costs of aging and emigration.
Directors welcomed the completion of the asset quality review (AQR) and stress test, and
considered it a positive step toward strengthening confidence in the banking sector and the
Bulgarian National Bank’s (BNB) ability to supervise it. While most banks remained well
capitalized after the AQR adjustments, a few domestically-owned banks have capital buffer
shortfalls which require prompt action. Directors welcomed the authorities’ readiness to attract
new bona fide investors in the identified banks and to intervene if these banks are not able to
successfully restore capital buffers to the required levels within the announced time frame. At the
same time, they noted that the high stock of non-performing loans requires further attention.
Directors welcomed recent progress to strengthen the institutional framework for financial
system oversight, and encouraged the authorities to continue these reforms and pursue a more
risk-based supervisory review and evaluation process. They looked forward to the findings of the
FSAP, which is underway and will be finalized in the first half of 2017.
Directors noted that fiscal consolidation is advancing faster than anticipated, and commended the
authorities for their successful efforts in strengthening revenue administration. They supported
the authorities’ plan to save the revenue overperformance for 2016, noting the need to strengthen
fiscal buffers to address unanticipated needs that could arise from contingent liabilities. Directors
also encouraged the authorities to better utilize EU funds to strengthen public investment. They
considered the authorities’ medium-term plan to attain fiscal balance appropriate, and stressed
that contingent liabilities, from state-owned enterprises and other sources, should be better

Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

estimated and incorporated in fiscal planning. Over the longer term, there is a need to ensure
fiscal sustainability in the face of the projected rise of aging-related spending.
Directors noted that raising Bulgaria’s potential growth will require progress on several
structural fronts. Key priorities include mitigating the effects of aging and emigration through
active labor market policies and fostering conditions for emigrants to return, stimulating private
investment through reducing red-tape and corruption, and improving the competitiveness and
governance of state-owned enterprises. Directors also encouraged greater efforts to develop
human capital through education and training.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. The Bulgarian economy has shown resilience since the last Article IV
consultation. Growth over the last 4 quarters exceeded expectations. The authorities
took concrete steps to correct the fiscal slippage in 2014 and efforts are underway to
strengthen confidence in the health of the financial system. Looking ahead, risks to the
outlook are broadly balanced. Downside risks stem mostly from weak external demand,
possible regional tension, and reversal in domestic policy reforms.
Key policy issues. The Article IV discussions focused on near-term policy actions to
enhance financial stability, medium-term options to raise Bulgaria’s growth prospects,
and measures to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability.


Financial stability. It is essential to follow-up on the recently completed asset
quality review and stress test to restore capital buffers of identified banks to required
levels, use the information acquired during the banking assessment to pursue a more
risk-based supervisory review and evaluation process, and devote adequate resources
to more inspections. The upcoming FSAP will provide a more in-depth assessment of
the financial sector and help guide future banking supervision and resolution
reforms.



Growth prospects. Raising Bulgaria’s potential growth will require policies to offset
the adverse impact from emigration and population-aging; enhance SOE
competitiveness and governance; and reduce perceptions of corruption.



Fiscal sustainability. The authorities’ plans to save recent revenue overperformance
are welcome. The risks from contingent liabilities and longer-term fiscal pressures
from aging and emigration are significant. Further pension, health, and education
reforms will be required to ensure fiscal sustainability in the long term.

Past IMF advice. Many recommendations during the 2015 Article IV consultation have
been broadly reflected in Bulgaria’s policies. A banking sector assessment was
completed in mid-August and fiscal performance this year has been better than
expected. There has been less progress in reducing contingent liabilities and structural
reforms to boost growth.

CONTEXT
1.
The Bulgarian economy has been resilient to shocks. Repercussions from the failure of a
large domestically-owned bank in 2014 and spillovers on Bulgarian banks from the Greek crisis in
2015 were largely contained and, since then, macroeconomic conditions have been steadily
improving. The output gap is narrowing, unemployment continues to decline, and the current
account is broadly in line with fundamentals. The fiscal balance improved significantly in 2015 and
the outturn through August 2016 points to considerable overperformance in 2016. Public debt,
despite a noticeable increase in 2014, is still among the lowest in Europe. Non-financial corporate
sector debt remains high, although a significant share consists of inter-company debt.
2.
Nevertheless, there are important challenges: solidifying financial stability, raising
potential growth, and addressing the fiscal costs of aging and emigration. The failure of a large
domestically-owned bank in 2014 triggered a number of welcome steps to strengthen the financial
sector. Continuing these efforts is essential to strengthen confidence and support growth. While
there has been recent economic momentum, Bulgaria’s per capita income on a purchasing power
parity (PPP) basis remains less than half of the EU-28 average. Estimates of potential growth have
fallen since the global financial crisis, reflecting declining investment, diminishing gains in
productivity, and especially adverse demographic trends (Appendices I and II). There is an urgent
need to improve infrastructure and accelerate structural reforms, especially in the energy sector and
state-owned enterprises. Difficult reforms will also be required to protect long-term fiscal
sustainability in the face of the projected rise of health and pension related spending pressures.
3.

Against this background, this Article IV report focuses on three key areas:



Financial stability. It discusses the recent banking sector assessment (consisting of an asset
quality review (AQR) and stress test) and identifies reforms to strengthen the financial system.



Growth prospects. It analyzes the key drivers of medium-term growth, including the role played
by emigration and state-owned enterprises in key infrastructure sectors.



Long-term fiscal sustainability. It assesses recent fiscal developments, the magnitude of longterm demographic-related spending pressures, and discusses options for addressing them.

of growth, offsetting weakening export growth and a slump in EU-fund related public investment.

5.
Deflation has largely been driven by
international commodity prices. Prices have
fallen more than in the euro area in recent months
as energy and commodity prices have a larger
weight in the Bulgarian Harmonized Index of
Consumer Prices (HICP) basket than in the euro
area. While the major driving forces of deflation are
external, some internal factors, including food and
communication prices, have also contributed. Most
recent data point to a gradual easing of deflation,
supported by decelerating energy price declines
and a pick-up in food prices.

The external position has continued to strengthen. The current account registered a
surplus of 1.4 percent of GDP in 2015 and stood at 2.8 percent of projected 2016 GDP during
January-July 2016. FDI has remained subdued. External debt declined modestly, to about 77 percent
of GDP at end-July 2016, reflecting lower liabilities by both public and private debtors. The external

and in turn limited productivity growth; modest
investment due to weaknesses in the business environment; and a shrinking labor force due to
continued emigration and population aging. This projected medium-term growth is considerably
below both the average for Central, Eastern, and Southeastern European (CESEE) countries and what
is needed to ensure a desirable pace of convergence.

9.
Risks to the growth outlook are broadly balanced. On the external front, a protracted
slowdown in the euro area or in Turkey would adversely affect Bulgaria’s export performance. While
the direct effects of Brexit on Bulgaria appear limited so far, the indirect effects through the impact
on the EU and sustained uncertainty could be more significant. On the domestic front, delays in
absorption of EU funds would weigh on growth and contingent liabilities pose a threat to the fiscal
position. On the upside, ambitious steps to restart structural reforms and faster recovery in Europe
could improve Bulgaria’s growth prospects. In particular, strong political will to tackle governance
concerns, reduce red-tape and improve the business environment, and enhance SOEs’ governance
and competitiveness would accelerate income convergence.
Authorities’ Views
10.
The authorities expected slightly lower growth in the near-term but higher growth in
the medium-term. The authorities’ most recent projections available at the time of the mission
were more conservative than staff’s due to lower contributions from consumption and investment.
Over the medium-term, the authorities projected slightly higher growth than staff, expecting
stronger structural reforms and investment. The authorities agreed that risks were broadly balanced.
They highlighted downside risks from potential instability in Turkey, given Bulgaria’s relatively large
export exposure and geographic proximity.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Financial Sector
11.
Following a large bank (KTB) failure in 2014, the authorities have taken welcome steps
to strengthen supervision and confidence in the banking system.2 First, to strengthen bank
supervision and resolution, the authorities undertook the Basel Core Principle (BCP) and the
International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI) assessments and are implementing a detailed
reform plan to follow-up on their recommendations (Appendix III).3 In this regard, a law was passed
in Parliament to expand the Bulgarian National Bank’s (BNB) powers for imposing supervisory
measures, including dismissing senior management and replacing bank auditors. Second, to reduce
uncertainty and enhance transparency, the authorities have recently concluded an AQR and stress
test of the banking system (Appendix IV). Third, the authorities have taken steps to strengthen crisis
resolution management and rebuild the banking system’s safety net. The transposition of the
European Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) into Bulgarian law has been a major step
forward in this respect but significant work remains for its effective implementation. Another
important step was the replenishment of the Bulgarian Deposit Insurance Fund (BDIF), which had
been depleted by the 2014 KTB failure. In the first half of 2016, the BDIF secured two governmentguaranteed loans from the WB and EBRD of €300 million each to shore up its financial capacity.
Finally, the authorities have requested an FSAP, which is expected to be completed in the first half of
2017 and should provide guidance for further reforms.
12.
The authorities’ efforts to strengthen the banking system will support growth and
help boost the provision of credit to businesses and households. Private sector credit growth
has remained tepid since the global financial crisis, although in a large part reflecting weak credit
demand with high capital adequacy and high liquidity for most banks. Access to financing is ranked
number one among the concerns for business in Bulgaria, based on the World Economic Forum’s
(WEF’s) Global Competitiveness Report. While this is a constraint facing all business, it is more
binding in the case of innovation and for SMEs in particular.4 In this context, weaknesses in the legal
and institutional framework for debt resolution and restructuring constitute important constraints in
improving the lending and investment environment. To better target these obstacles the authorities
are interested in setting up a system allowing continuous assessment and monitoring of the
developments in the debt resolution processes, with a focus on insolvency.5 Asset prices have stayed
broadly stable over the last year. The pressure from a confluence of macro-financial factors
continued to abate, benefiting from improved growth outlook, the strengthened fiscal position,

The banking system came under stress in 2015 due to spillovers from Greece but the
authorities successfully managed the episode and the system remained stable.6 Overall, the
impact was largely contained, with a smooth redistribution of about 3 percent of the system’s

14.
The recently completed assessment of the banking system provided needed
transparency. The results showed that most of the system remains well-capitalized after the AQR
adjustments, particularly the foreign-owned banks, which represent 76 percent of total system
assets. In aggregate terms, the AQR adjustments amounted to 1.3 percent of risk-weighted assets,
to be reflected in the banks’ end-2016 financial statements. Nevertheless, there were significant
differences in the results across banks. First Investment Bank (FIB), the largest domestic bank (with
about 10 percent of the banking system assets and a history of problems) and two small banks were
found to have shortfalls against capital buffers required by the BNB (Appendix IV). Additional buffers
may also be needed to cover Pillar II capital requirements that may arise from extrapolating the AQR
findings and from an assessment of banks’ risk profiles highlighted by the Stress Test (ST).
15.
Bank recovery strategies should seek to decisively restore credibility in the identified
banks. One of the small banks has already raised capital, and the other two banks are pursuing
private sector solutions to restore their capital buffers by mid-2017. Sourcing equity from new bona
fide investors would help improve credibility and address governance concerns, especially for FIB,
which has had protracted connected-lending issues. The BNB will need to be confident that new
capital—whether from external or domestic sources—does not rely on borrowed funds. It would

system.

10

also be important to comply with the stipulated timeline and for the authorities to be ready to
intervene if the banks are not able to restore capital buffers to required levels.7
16.
The authorities need to persevere in their efforts to strengthen the banking system.
While a new governance structure at the BNB has been put in place (Appendix III), efforts are still
needed in other areas indicated by the IADI and BCP recommendations. The ongoing reforms would
usefully be informed by the findings of the FSAP expected in the first half of 2017, but already
identified areas for reform are as follows:


Asset quality. The NPL ratio in Bulgaria rose after the global financial crisis and has remained
broadly stable in recent years.8 As of 2016Q1 it stood at 14½ percent (EBA definition), which is
more than double the EU average.9 The AQR has helped to properly identify NPLs and to ensure
that banks set aside appropriate provisions against expected losses, which, together with
improving public confidence, should help to foster credit growth going forward. Nevertheless,
there is a need to strengthen efforts to reduce NPLs, particularly for banks with lower capital
ratios. High NPLs could constrain credit provision by such banks and, more generally, pose a
threat to banking stability in an adverse scenario. To reduce NPLs, the authorities should take
proactive measures to promote effective write-offs within a reasonable time frame. For example,
they could require explicit operational targets for banks to engage borrowers in loan
restructuring discussions. Further steps are also needed to remove impediments to releasing
collateral associated with NPLs, including judicial bottlenecks and the lack of out-of-court
workout mechanisms. Reduced concerns about loan and collateral valuation following the AQR
should help deepen the market for distressed debt.



Bank governance. Important deficiencies in bank governance have yet to be addressed. They
include the need to strengthen the regulatory requirements for transparency of groups’
operational and ownership structures (including through stricter rules on the definition and
monitoring of banks’ ultimate beneficial owners and related parties), and to upgrade the Boards’
governance and its involvement in setting the risk appetite framework.



Bank supervision. There is a need to enhance risk-based supervision in the BNB. The recent
BCP assessment report pointed out that while the methodologies for the analysis and
assessment are sound, the actual implementation is undercut by the scarcity of resources. To
bridge this gap significant efforts would be required in terms of organization, staffing, processes
and guidelines, in addition to further legislative and regulatory amendments. Particular
emphasis needs to be put on implementation of the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process,
building on the information collected through the AQR and ST about the banks’ risk profile. It

7

At this stage, neither bank resolution nor public support is envisaged.

8

The increase in the ratio between 2014Q4 and 2015Q1 is in large part due to the adoption of a stricter definition in
accordance with EU standards starting from 2015.
9

This ratio increases to about 20 percent if loans to financial sectors are excluded, consistent with the Bulgarian
reporting standards to the IMF FSI database.

would also be important for the BNB to announce a comprehensive set of indicators for early
intervention in banks.


Financial safety net. The BDIF’s net asset position remains negative (-1.5 percent of GDP as of
July 2016). Given current bank contributions (0.3 percent of GDP each year), it will be years
before it can fully repay its debt and reach the targeted funding level of 1 percent of the total
amount of covered deposits with banks. The recently-created Bank Resolution Fund started to
collect fees from banks in late 2015. To backstop confidence on the banking system, the
authorities should consider speeding up the progress in moving towards the targeted coverage
ratios, and keep those ratios under periodic reviews against potential needs.

17.
Ongoing reviews of the private pension funds and insurance companies will shed light
for the first time on this relatively small but increasingly important sector. Concerns about the
sector have persisted, including about related party transactions, the quality of supervision, and the
adequacy of supervisory resources. The reviews of pension funds’ assets and insurance companies’
balance sheets, overseen by the Financial Supervisory Commission with a newly appointed head, are
expected to be completed by year-end.
Authorities’ views
18.
The authorities stressed their commitment to address issues identified by the AQR and
ST in the banking sector. They plan to use the information collected during the assessment process
to upgrade banking supervision capacity. The authorities are in the process of developing a new
plan on reforms and development of banking supervision and resolution. They plan to wait for the
recommendations from the upcoming FSAP before finalizing their reform plan.

Decisive structural reform efforts are needed to support short-term growth and to
boost Bulgaria’s medium-term growth potential. Specifically,


Improving the conditions for investment would help both short-term growth and
medium-term potential. The Bulgarian authorities have been working on an action plan to
raise investment. Their plans include improving infrastructure, removing regulatory
bottlenecks for investment, strengthening vocational educational quality and skill
development to improve the employability of workers, and enhancing the consistency and
efficiency of administrative procedures. Swift implementation will be key to achieve tangible
effects on the investment climate in Bulgaria.



Ensuring a smooth transition to the new programming period will enable Bulgaria to
reap maximum growth benefits from EU-funded public investment in the near and
medium terms. It will be important to ensure timely implementation of the laws on EU
funds and on public procurement, including enhanced ex-ante control and e-procurement
procedures. Training programs to build capacity at the municipal level will help improve EU
fund absorption.



Fighting corruption and adopting a comprehensive judiciary overhaul would provide
better conditions for investment and productivity growth. In particular, the authorities
should adopt a comprehensive anti-corruption law, free of amendments that compromise its
effectiveness, and establish a single agency with adequate powers and independence,
consolidating the anti-corruption work currently being performed in an uncoordinated
manner. Stepped-up efforts are also needed to establish a track record of successful

investigations and prosecutions of alleged high-level corruption. In this regard, BNB’s efforts
to ensure that banks apply specific due diligence measures on accounts related to politically
exposed persons are welcome and should be strengthened, notably to ensure that the
source of wealth is established, when appropriate.

Enhancing the governance and performance of state-owned enterprises would help
reduce contingent liabilities and improve productivity. Bulgaria would benefit from a
comprehensive SOE governance reform, oriented at international best practices as
formulated by the OECD. Specifically, defining the scope and mandate of SOEs, ensuring
effective oversight of their financial performance and fiscal risks in a dedicated unit in
government, establishing clear performance targets and evaluation tools for SOEs, as well as
professionalizing SOE boards would significantly improve the coherence and effectiveness of
SOE governance.14 Moreover, deregulation, opening up for foreign investors, and enhancing
competition in SOE-dominated industries, in particular the energy sector, have been shown
to strengthen productivity across all service-dependent sectors of the economy.17 These

measures, combined with a strategy to reduce contingent liabilities, would help enhance
SOE performance, lower fiscal risks, and support productivity and growth in the economy.
Authorities’ views
25.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff recommendations. They stressed their
commitment to improve the business environment by implementing their action plan for attracting
private investment. Regarding public investment, they intended to further improve EU funds
absorption during this programming period, and noted ongoing efforts to improve administrative
capacity. The authorities also reiterated their commitment to advance the anti-corruption agenda.
Emigration was acknowledged as a key economic challenge and the authorities noted that they are
pursuing some active labor market policies to improve labor force participation. The authorities are
considering legislation to better monitor SOEs’ financial performance and fiscal risks, and expressed
interest in Fund advice in this area.

C. Fiscal Policy
26.
Fiscal consolidation is proceeding faster than expected. The cash deficit declined to
2.9 percent of GDP in 2015, driven largely by administrative revenue measures and higher-thanexpected growth. This represented an adjustment of about ½ percent of GDP in structural terms and
partially reversed the slippage in 2014.18 In 2016, the outturn through August showed significant
overperformance relative to the budget, reflecting increases in excise rates, sustained administrative
measures (Appendix V), faster-than-expected growth, and under-execution of EU-funded capital
spending at the beginning of a new program period.
27.
The recent revenue overperformance should be saved. In 2016, tax revenue is projected
to outperform the budget target by ¾ percent of GDP. Saving this gain is appropriate given the
need to strengthen fiscal buffers to address any unanticipated needs that could arise from
contingent liabilities in the energy, financial, and other sectors. It is also supported from a cyclical
perspective—as recent consumption growth has been above trend. Assuming the revenue
overperformance is saved and EU-funds spending accelerated, the cash deficit for 2016 is projected
to decline to 0.8 percent of GDP, significantly below the budget target of 2 percent of GDP.19
28.
The authorities’ medium-term plans appropriately target cash fiscal balance by 2020.
The cash deficit is projected to widen to 1.2 percent of GDP in 2017 as some delayed EU-funded
capital spending is expected to be executed in 2017; the deficit should fall on an accrual basis.20 The
18

The 2014 cash deficit was 3.6 percent of GDP, compared to the original target of 1.8 percent of GDP. In the
structural terms, the deficit declined from 2.8 percent of GDP in 2014 to 2.2 percent of GDP in 2015.
19

The headline deficit, but not the structural deficit, could be higher if a recently approved government loan is
reclassified from being below the line to above the line; see para. 33 for further information.
20

EU-funded projects are 85 percent financed by EU grants and 15 percent by national co-financing. The timing
difference between EU fund-related spending and its reimbursement affects fiscal balances on a cash basis, but not
on an accrual basis.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BULGARIA

deficit, then, is expected to gradually decline to zero by 2020, as required by the Public Finance
Act.21 Adhering to the authorities’ consolidation plan and maintaining a structural balanced budget
thereafter will help reduce government debt gradually to below 25 percent of GDP. Keeping public
debt low is especially important in the context of Bulgaria’s currency board arrangement.
29.
The authorities’ medium-term consolidation plans are based on a combination of
expenditure restraint and revenue measures. The authorities plan to reduce government’s
personal expenses by 10 percent and limit spending on goods and services. To ensure efficiency
gains, it is important that the cut in personal expenses be supported by measures to enhance
efficiency in the provision of public services as laid out in the Development Strategy of the State
Administration 2015–2020.22 On the revenue side, the authorities plan to raise excises and social
security contribution rates in 2017–18. If the envisaged expenditure savings do not materialize, the
authorities could consider additional growth friendly tax measures, for instance raising the property
tax.
30.
There are significant long-term fiscal pressures associated with demographic trends.23
Bulgaria’s current pension system comprises three pillars: a defined benefit pay-as-you-go scheme
with annual deficits of around 5½ percent of GDP (Pillar 1), a mandatory defined contribution
private pension scheme (Pillar 2), and a voluntary defined contribution private pension scheme
(Pillar 3). A shrinking and aging population will have fiscal implications through its effects on
economic activity, and on health and Pillar 1 pension spending. To mitigate pension spending
pressures, Bulgaria implemented parametric reforms to the Pillar 1 system in 2015 (Appendix VI).
These reforms would help reduce Pillar 1 annual deficits moderately in the next decade. However,
long-term fiscal sustainability concerns remain. First, over a longer time horizon (i.e., through 2100)
there could be a significant increase in pension and health related spending.24 Second, due to public
concerns about the performance of the Pillar 2 system, the 2015 reforms introduced an unorthodox
option to allow unlimited shifts of balances between Pillar 1 and 2 and reduced Pillar 2 fees.
Sustainability would be undermined if concerns about the viability of private pension funds were to
lead to large shifts to Pillar 1.

21

The Public Finance Act sets the target for the general government sector (in the national definition) as the
attainment and/or maintenance of a zero or positive balance (Article 25). The Act also determines that the general
government deficit in the European System of Accounts (ESA) 2010 basis shall not exceed 3 percent of GDP. The
main difference between the national and ESA definitions include the accounting basis (i.e., the former is on a cash
basis while the latter on an accrual basis) and coverage (e.g., the former excludes the BDIF while the latter includes it).
22

For example, direct subsidies for farmers are sizable at 1.6 percent of GDP in 2016. However, several different
farmer support instruments are not aligned to the social and macroeconomic goals, suggesting a scope for efficiency
gains. Studies also suggest the inefficiencies of social protection spending (IMF, 2014).
23

See the Selected Issues Paper of “Fiscal Implications of Demographic Changes in Bulgaria.”

24

Age related spending is sensitive to demographic projections which are subject to significant uncertainties.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BULGARIA

31.
Addressing long-term spending pressures will require further pension reforms. Further
parametric reforms—raising the social security contribution rate and/or statutory retirement age—
would be needed in the long term to support the sustainability of public pension system. Changes
to each parameter, however, have different macroeconomic and social implications and careful
consideration should be given when deciding between them. In addition, reducing incentives for
shifting to Pillar 2 through improving Pillar 2 performance will also help mitigate spending pressures
from the public pension system


Raise the social security contribution rate.
Similar to other European countries with a
mandatory private pension scheme, Bulgaria’s
public pension system has relatively low
contribution collections and income
replacement rates. To enhance the
sustainability of the public pension system
while preventing an increase in old-age
poverty, the social contribution rates could be
raised further while paying attention to
potential impact on competitiveness.



Increase the statutory retirement ages.
Bulgaria’s statutory retirement ages for men and women are expected to remain below the
EU medians even after reaching 65 years by 2029 for men and by 2037 for women. The
2015 pension reforms introduced an automatic link between the statutory retirement ages
and life expectancy once the statutory retirement ages reach 65 years. To de-politicize
further reforms, the modalities of adjusting the retirement ages need to be fleshed out.
Raising the retirement age, however, should be accompanied by measures—such as active

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BULGARIA

labor market policies or wage subsidies—to facilitate old-age employment. In addition, the
government should be alert that increasing the retirement age could disproportionately
affect low-income workers given their shorter life expectancy, thereby reducing the
progressivity of the public pension system.


Revamp Pillar 2 and 3 private pension schemes depending on the results of the asset
quality review. Sound defined-contribution pension schemes would help reduce old-age
poverty while minimizing the risks to public finance. The ongoing review of private pension
funds’ assets is expected to help identify the weaknesses of the system, including investment
in related companies.

32.
Structural reforms can help achieve fiscal sustainability while enhancing long-term
growth. Bulgaria’s spending efficiency on education, health, and public investment lags that of its
peers, suggesting ample scope for efficiency gains.


Health. Measures to address Bulgaria’s low use of preventive measures and outpatient
services and overuse of inpatient care could improve the health outcomes. In addition,
recent measures to address the over-supply of hospitals treating a low number of patients
and contain pharmaceutical pricing would help. Demand for long-term care (LTC) services is
bound to increase strongly with aging. Providing high-quality LTC services while ensuring
financial sustainability requires a legislative amendment to enhance synergy between the
social services system and health care system.



Education. Labor productivity could be enhanced by modernizing vocational education and
encouraging adult participation in lifelong learning. In addition, education could be
improved by integrating vulnerable groups as envisaged in the Strategy for Educational
Integration of Children from Ethnic Minorities, 2015–2020.



Public investment. To enhance the productivity of public investment, the appraisal,
selection, and approval of investment projects needs to be made more rigorous and
transparent. In this regard, enhancing the capacity for assessing economic and social
evaluation of project proposals beyond engineering analysis would help. Strengthening
procurement practices—such as greater transparency, faster procurement, and more
competition—would also help improve public investment.25

25

The 2011 CVM report found a general irregularity rate of 60 percent among all verified tenders related to EU funds
and irregularity in almost 100 percent of large public infrastructure projects where the authorities had an obligation
for ex-ante control. The 2016 CVM report also indicated that compared with other EU member states, the European
Anti-Fraud Office has a relatively high number of ongoing investigations with Bulgaria related to EU funds. These
cases are mainly related to possible corruption, irregularities, and fraud with public procurement carried out by
municipal authorities. The recently-enacted Public Procurement Act is expected to help reduce public procurement
deficiencies.

There are sizeable fiscal contingent liabilities which the authorities need to monitor
closely and reflect in fiscal planning.

a more prominent oversight role. A case in point is the recent ruling by the International
Court of Arbitration, ordering Bulgaria’s state-owned National Electricity Company (NEK) to
pay Russia’s Atomstroyexport for equipment already produced for the cancelled Belene
nuclear power plant project (Appendix VII). Parliament recently approved an interest free
loan to help NEK to clear this obligation. Based on available information this loan is treated
below the line. If NEK’s repayment capacity is considered insufficient, it would be treated
above the line as an expense and could increase the 2016 deficit by 1.4 percent of GDP. 26



Subnational governments: Municipalities in Bulgaria have many autonomous powers,
including debt financing albeit within limits. Such autonomy often creates tension with the
MOF’s mandate on fiscal policy. To address the financial problems in a number of
municipalities, the government has recently amended the Public Finance Act, giving
municipalities access to interest-free loans, on the condition that municipalities adopt MOF
approved financial recovery plans and comply with the criteria stimulated in the amended
Public Finance Act. 27

26

The implementation of the law is conditional to the EC’s positive decision, which is yet to be issued.

27

According to the MOF, more than a half of Bulgaria’s 265 municipalities now have overdue loans, and in some
cases the late payments account for over 90 percent of their budgets. The financial problems of the municipalities
tend to be linked to the absorption of the European programs: the local authorities have to fund the EU regional
development projects that they manage in advance and await recovery of their investments, which creates holes in
their budgets.



Large shifts from Pillar 2 to Pillar 1. Short-term budget implications of such shifts are
likely positive as the increases in social security contribution would outpace the increases in
pension payments, but the long-term adverse implications on the budget could be sizable.

Authorities’ views
34.
The authorities plan to save the revenue overperformance in 2016 and confirmed their
plans for continued fiscal consolidation to attain fiscal balance by 2020. They saw a possibility
of ending 2016 with a deficit under 0.8 percent of GDP given difficulties in accelerating EU-funds
absorption. Regarding recent strong revenue collection, the authorities highlighted the concerted
efforts being led by the Prime Minister to reduce smuggling, improve tax compliance and combat
the shadow economy under a single national strategy for 2015–17. 28 The authorities agreed that
while the 2015 reforms were a step in a right direction, additional parametric reforms will be needed
in the long term to fully address the sustainability concerns of the public pension system. They also
noted that these administrative measures would be sustained. Regarding pensions, the authorities
stressed that the ultimate risks related to the shifts from Pillar 2 to Pillar 1 systems came from public
concerns regarding the viability of private pension funds. If such risks materialized, the government
would be compelled to help pensioners because participation in the Pillar 2 private pension system
was obligatory until the 2015 reforms.

STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
The Bulgarian economy has shown resilience to shocks. The economy withstood well the
failure of the fourth largest bank in 2014 and negative spillovers from Greece in 2015. Output is
growing at a steady pace, unemployment is at its lowest level in seven years, and the external
current account has remained in surplus. The fiscal balance improved significantly in 2015 and the
outturn so far points to a considerable revenue overperformance in 2016. Government debt, despite
a noticeable increase in 2014, is among the lowest in Europe.
36.
The completion of the AQR and the stress test is a welcome step towards
strengthening confidence in the banking sector and the BNB’s ability to supervise it. It is
essential that identified banks restore capital buffers to required levels promptly. Participation of
new bona fide investors would help improve credibility and governance. If the two identified banks
are not able to successfully bring capital buffers to required levels within the announced time frame,
it would be important for the authorities to intervene promptly.
37.
Recent reforms to strengthen the institutional framework for financial system
oversight are welcome and should continue. The central bank should use the information
acquired as part of the AQR and stress test to pursue a more risk-based supervisory review and

Compliance Costs, 2015–17.

evaluation process, with adequate resources secured to facilitate more inspections. Following the
Basel Core Principles assessment, there is a need to tighten the legal framework pertaining to
ultimate beneficial owners and related party lending, and for the BNB to announce a comprehensive
set of indicators for early intervention in banks. The upcoming FSAP will provide a more in-depth
assessment of the financial sector and its findings would help guide future reforms including for
supervision of non-banks.
38.
Raising Bulgaria’s potential growth will require progress on several structural fronts.
The effects of aging and emigration should be mitigated through active labor market policies and
fostering conditions for emigrants to return. Reducing red-tape and corruption will improve the
business environment and help reverse several years of decline in private investment. Improving the
competitiveness and governance of SOEs would not only reduce fiscal contingent liabilities but also
help enhance productivity.
39.
Recent fiscal developments have been encouraging but longer-term challenges
remain. The authorities’ plans to save revenue overperformance in 2016 are welcome. At the same
time, the execution of EU-funded capital spending should be accelerated. Medium-term plans to
reach fiscal balance will strengthen fiscal buffers. Contingent liabilities in the energy, financial, and
other sectors should be estimated and incorporated in fiscal planning. Over the longer-term,
reforms will be required to protect fiscal sustainability in the face of the projected rise of health- and
pension-related spending pressures. Steps may also be needed should concerns arise regarding the
viability of private pension funds, in order to discourage excessive shifts to the public pension
system and protect fiscal sustainability.
40.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Bulgaria take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Annex I. Competitiveness and External Sector Assessment
Staff’s overall assessment is that Bulgaria’s external position in 2015 was broadly in line with
fundamentals. However, continued labor cost increase in excess of productivity growth could pose risks
to competitiveness going forward. Achieving a balanced fiscal position in line with the authorities’
consolidation plan will help to sustain external sustainability.
Competitiveness developments
1.
Wages and labor cost have been on an increasing trend, outpacing productivity
growth. After the post-crisis correction, manufacturing labor costs picked up again in 2011 and
have been on an accelerated growth trend since 2014. Bulgaria’s adjusted wage share development
decoupled from regional peers in 2011 and has reached EU levels in 2014. Since 2012, wage growth
in Bulgaria has surpassed labor productivity growth, highlighting risks to competitiveness in Bulgaria
going forward. In regional peer countries, wage growth developed more in line with productivity.

The analysis of Bulgaria’s real effective exchange rates paints a mixed picture. Driven
by rising labor costs, Bulgaria’s REER based on ULC has strongly appreciated well beyond the
financial crisis. The consumption-based REER, however, was broadly stable during the post-crisis

low-inflation environment and has depreciated recently in view of imported deflation, largely on the
back of falling international energy prices. With a few exceptions, HICP-based and ULC-based REERs
were more aligned in regional peer countries (see box). According to the REER model of the
extended External Balance Assessment (“EBA-lite”), the gap between the actual and REER norm is
estimated at 3 percent. Although pointing to slight overvaluation, this result is within the range
considered in line with fundamentals. Due to the large cross-country coverage of the model, the
employed REER is based on consumer prices. The divergence between consumption-based and
ULC-based REER developments in Bulgaria raises the question of potential overvaluation risks.
3.
Wages are catching up from a very low level and have been pushed by increasing labor
shortage. Bulgaria’s wage level is still the lowest among EU countries and has been increasing with
accelerated speed since EU accession in 2007. While catching-up dynamics explain part of Bulgaria’s
rapid wage growth, cyclical factors, unfavorable demographics and continuous emigration of
high-skilled workers have contributed to rising wages in recent years. Labor shortage has
increasingly been reported as a binding factor limiting business activity in the industry sector.

Competitiveness Developments in Regional Peer Countries
Across Central, Eastern, and Southeastern
EU countries, Bulgaria stands out with the
largest gulf between HICP-based and
ULC-based REERs. Bulgaria’s divergence
between price and wage developments is
unmatched among peer countries. Only
Estonia and Latvia exhibit a notable positive
difference between ULC-based and
HICP-based REER trajectories, pointing to
excessive wage developments. In Lithuania
and Hungary, on the other hand, ULC
developments have surpassed consumer
price-driven appreciation since the
beginning of the decade.

Estonia and Latvia underwent significant internal devaluation in the wake of the financial
crisis while keeping their exchange rates fixed. In both countries, sharp increases of ULC-based
REERs at the height of the boom period had opened large gaps between wage and price
developments. The bust in the financial sectors of Estonia and Latvia put their fixed exchange
rates under pressure and resulted in significant internal devaluations, reflected in marked nominal
wage reductions as expressed by falling ULC-REERs. Since 2012, wage growth has recovered and
ULC-based REERs have started to appreciate again while price-based REERs continued to be
stable. As Bulgaria was not affected by the financial boom-bust cycle to the same extent as the
Baltic countries, the correction pressure on nominal wages in the presence of fixed exchange rates
was lower and did hence not result in notable ULC-REER corrections.

Bulgaria’s export performance has been resilient so far. Bulgaria’s goods export volume
grew by 44 percent between 2010 and 2015, exceeding export growth in peer countries among the
EU’s other new member states. The world market share of Bulgarian exports has been increasing
steadily and, despite some slowdown since 2013, has outperformed peer countries. This
performance was likely supported by higher productivity gains in tradable industries than in
non-tradable service sectors, as well as by improvements in non-cost competitiveness.1

Overall, risks to Bulgaria’s competitiveness are limited but might be rising. So far,
increasing wages do not appear to have seriously impaired Bulgaria’s export performance as labor
cost are still at comparable low levels. Going forward, competitiveness concerns could arise should
the current trend of divergence between wage growth and productivity growth continue.

The current account has corrected
sharply since the financial crisis. After a deficit of
-23.7 percent in 2007, the current account adjusted
rapidly in light of the abrupt reduction in capital
inflows, including FDI. The current account
correction was mainly driven by compressed
imports on the back of weaker domestic demand
and investment-related imports while exports
remained resilient. Since 2010, the current account
has been broadly balanced, recording a small
surplus of 1.4 percent in 2015.

around -1.7 percent of GDP. Furthermore, the EBA-lite regression features a large constant term
which reflects a sizeable unexplained need for external financing across the large emerging market
country sample, compared to the smaller constant in the EBA regression. As Bulgaria is not facing
the same unexplained need for external financing as the EBA-lite country sample of emerging
markets, staff considers it appropriate to adjust the cyclically-adjusted CA norm upward by about
2 percentage points. As a result, the revised cyclically-adjusted CA norm amounts to -3.6 percent of
GDP, implying a CA gap of 1.8 percent and a REER gap of -4.2 percent. This scenario builds on the
authorities’ plan to achieve a balanced structural budget position in the medium term. In light of
Bulgaria’s larger uncertainty in the balance of payments, with a CA standard error of 9 percent
compared to the EBA sample standard error of 5 percent, Bulgaria’s external position is considered
broadly consistent with fundamentals and desirable policy settings.
International reserves
10.
Bulgaria’s international reserves have further increased and remain at an adequate
level. The ratio of reserves over GDP increased from 36 to 45 percent from 2014 to 2015, remaining
well above the standard rules of thumb, namely three months’ coverage of prospective imports and
20 percent of broad money. In 2015, reserves also exceeded 100 percent of short-term debt as well
as the IMF’s metric for assessment of reserve adequacy (ARA) in emerging markets by a large
margin. In light of Bulgaria’s currency board arrangement, the ratio of reserves over the monetary
base declined recently but still amounted to a comfortable level of 141 percent in 2015. The broad
money coverage ratio, gauging the resilience to financial distress, increased lately to 53 percent.

Annex II. Debt Sustainability
1.
External debt has accelerated its downward trend. Since its peak at 110 percent of GDP
at end-2009, gross external debt has declined mainly on account of private sector deleveraging in
the banking sector. From end-2014 to end-2015 alone, gross external debt fell from 92.1 to
77.2 percent of GDP, driven by banks but also a substantial decline in inter-company lending.
Excluding inter-company lending, external debt declined to 49.4 percent by end-2015, remaining
largely covered by international reserves. Rollover risks related to external exposure in the non-bank
private sector are contained given moderate short-term exposure; these risks also did not
materialize during the global financial crisis.
2.
Gross external debt is expected to decline further under staff’s baseline projections.
After increasing to a projected 81 percent of GDP in 2016 on the back of a Eurobond issuance (see
below), external debt is set to decline further to around 63 percent of GDP by 2021. The
medium-term decline in gross external debt is largely driven by nominal GDP growth whereas
nominal external debt is expected to remain broadly stable. While private-sector deleveraging is
projected to continue, external public sector lending will slightly increase, broadly offsetting each
other. The historical scenario, projecting external debt on the basis of 10-year averages of key
determinants, generates a very similar trajectory.
3.
External debt dynamics appear broadly resilient to shocks. Shocks to the interest rate,
the growth rate, and the current account deficit would shift the trajectory of external debt relative to
GDP upwards. The external debt to GDP ratio is projected to eventually resume its
downward-sloping path over the medium-term under all scenarios except for the current account
shock where external debt is projected to reach 85 percent over the medium-term.
4.
General government gross debt is projected to increase in 2016 to 30 percent of GDP,
but remains at manageable levels. Under the IMF’s standard DSA methodology, Bulgaria is
considered a “lower scrutiny” country given its relatively moderate level of debt and gross financing
needs. Public debt rose sharply between 2010 and 2015 driven by the loan to the Bulgarian Deposit
Insurance Fund and liquidity support to the banking sector, as well as the deterioration of the
primary balance and interest-growth dynamics, but is projected to begin declining in the medium
term on account of the government’s medium-term consolidation plan and improve in interestgrowth dynamics. In the near term, public debt is projected to increase in 2016 by 3.8 percentage
points of GDP over 2015 due to deflation and the recent sizable Eurobonds issuance (EUR 2 billion,
4.6 percent of GDP). Part of the Eurobonds-related inflows, however, are expected to be used for
creating buffers ahead of the AQR, resulting in an increase in Fiscal Reserve Account (FRA) by 2.5
percent of GDP in 2016. [In light of the uneventful outcomes of the AQR and stress test, the
authorities plan not to issue new Eurobonds in 2017 and limit new external borrowing to refinancing
the amortizations due in 2018 thereafter.] In the medium term, fiscal consolidation and a favorable
growth-interest rate differential will help decrease general government debt over time. Assuming
FRA balances to remain unchanged from the projected 2017 level (BGN 6.2 billion, 6¾ percent of
the 2017 GDP) for 2017–2021, general government debt would decline to 23 percent of GDP, below

the pre-2014 level, by 2021. If the government were to drawdown FRA for financing, the pace of
debt reduction could be faster.1
5.
Alternative scenarios indicate that general government debt would likely remain
below 40 percent of GDP under most shocks. The fan chart analysis shows that under a scenario
where the primary balance is not expected to over perform (but may under-perform) and where
growth shocks are more likely to be negative than positive, debt may exceed 40 percent of GDP by
2021 with a 15 percent chance, or by 2019 with a 10 percent chance. Gross financing needs are also
expected to remain well below 10 percent of GDP under various shock scenarios. The outcomes,
however, could be significantly higher if contingent liabilities—especially those related to SOEs and
the banking sector—materialize, pointing to the importance of sound fiscal risk assessment and
management.2
6.
In the longer term, spending pressures from the aging population can create
additional fiscal challenges. Assuming (i) the overall balance to evolve from the balanced position
in 2021 by the projected increases in age-related spending net of the projected increases in social
security contribution revenue through 2100 and (ii) the baseline scenario on GDP growth where the
demography changes in line with the UN’s
medium-fertility rate scenario, debt would first
decline to around 16½ percent of GDP by 2030,
which will then start increasing and exceed
60 percent of GDP by the mid-2060s. The debt
trajectory is sensitive to growth path. Assuming
the UN’s low-fertility rate scenario, debt would
start rising rapidly from the 2040s and exceed
100 percent of GDP by 2085. If a 100 percent
shift from Pillar 2 to Pillar 1 takes place in 2016,
government debt could rise to 60 percent of
GDP by 2059 even assuming the baseline GDP
growth projections, and would reach 130
percent of GDP by 2100.

The minimum balance of FRA is determined in the annual budget law. For 2016, the minimum balance is set at BGN 4.5 billion.

The total SOE liabilities stood at 13.4 percent of GDP at end-2014. The average fiscal cost of 91 financial crises across advanced
and emerging markets economy was about 10 percent of GDP (IMF, 2016).

Appendix I. Potential Growth
1.
Potential growth in Bulgaria has declined significantly. In the wake of the global financial
crisis, estimated potential growth rates in Bulgaria dropped markedly, from around 5–7 percent
during the peak in the mid-2000s to around 1–2 percent in recent years. Potential growth is
notoriously difficult to gauge when structural breaks like economic transition and the financial crisis
affect economies such as Bulgaria and supply-side effects are often hard to disentangle from
demand-side effects. Recent IMF analysis has addressed this challenge by estimating potential
output for a large set of Central, Eastern and Southeastern European countries with a number of
different approaches.1 While the results of these different estimation methodologies need to be
interpreted with caution and vary somewhat, the overall picture tends to indicate a significant decline
in potential growth over the last 10 years.

2.
Capital accumulation has been the major consistent driving force of potential growth in
Bulgaria. While capital and total factor productivity (TFP) contributed almost equally to potential
growth in the early 2000s, the capital share increased steadily until the onset of the financial crisis, on
the back of a surge in capital inflows and investment in anticipation of EU accession in 2007. By then,
FDI inflows had surged to 27 percent of GDP, reflected in a current account deficit of 24 percent in
the same year. Large parts of FDI inflows during the boom years went into non-tradable sectors, such
as financial services and real estate. They contributed fairly little to expanding the economy’s
productive capacity and laid the foundation for subdued potential growth subsequently. With the
sudden stop in capital inflows, FDI slumped—largely on account of the nontradable sector—and the
current account corrected sharply. Since the beginning of the decade, FDI has plateaued at around
3 percent of GDP.

3.
Contributions from labor turned negative in 2007, reflecting demographic trends and
falling labor participation. Labor contributions to potential growth peaked during the
pre-accession boom before receding and turning negative when Bulgaria entered the EU in 2007. The
chart shows that labor force growth had been driven by increasing participation rates during most of
the 2000s, offsetting negative effects from reductions in the working-age population. When
participation rates dropped in the late 2000s and population decline accelerated, overall labor force
growth turned negative. The secular decline in Bulgaria’s population is driven by low birth rates and
sizeable emigration which accelerated with EU accession (see Appendix VII on emigration for more
details). At the same time, an increasing natural unemployment rate, measured as the nonaccelerating wage rate of unemployment (NAWRU), put additional pressure on labor contributions.
4.
TFP growth stalled after the crisis, reflecting global and country-specific factors. Recent
IMF analysis shows that strong productivity growth before the crisis was broad-based across CESEE
countries and largely associated with favorable external or common factors, notably potential growth
in trading partners, expansion of global supply chains, global trade as well as FDI.2 For Bulgaria, these
effects were likely catalyzed already during the mid-2000s by the country’s prospective EU accession.
In terms of country-specific drivers of productivity, a number of structural and institutional obstacles
are identified which hamper technical efficiency and hence TFP growth. These factors include
unfavorable economic structures (a relatively low share of the service sector), weak institutions
(notably the lack of judicial independence and impartiality of courts), ineffective healthcare systems
(reflected by relatively low life expectancy), as well as restrictive business and FDI regulations. In
Bulgaria, most of these factors have likely added to global downward trends in TFP growth.

conditions and country-specific shocks such
as the mass lay-offs during the early transition period and the hyperinflation crisis during the late
1990s. EU accession in 2007 created a major pull factor, opening the opportunity for Bulgarian
nationals to enjoy free movement within the EU’s Single Market, even though certain limitations
applied during a transition period. Besides better work prospects, Western EU countries also offer
more generous social benefits which act as a pull factor particularly for unskilled migrants. And
increasing Bulgarian expat communities in certain countries tend to make the destination more
attractive for others to follow. As income and institutional convergence takes time, these factors
can be expected to remain powerful drivers of migration between Bulgaria and other EU
countries.

Emigration has adversely affected labor productivity and growth. According to recent
IMF analysis, the impact of emigration on labor productivity and growth is sizeable.1 In Bulgaria,
mainly the emigration of skilled labor has been detrimental to productivity growth—without
emigration, cumulated real labor productivity growth between 1995 and 2012 could have been
around 6 percent stronger than actually the case. The estimated cumulative loss of real GDP
growth during the same period amounts to around 8 percent—again mainly on account of skilled
emigration. Going forward, continued emigration has the potential to dampen Bulgaria’s growth
performance. Based on multi-region model simulations using UN projections for 2015–30, the
cumulative output loss could amount to around 5 percent. The main channels through which
emigration is modeled to impact growth include lower investment and consumption, lost
competitiveness through higher wages, and higher taxes on labor in response to social spending
pressures.

Appendix III. Improving Bank Supervision
Following the BCP assessment and the audit by the National Audit Office, a Plan on Reforms and
Development of Banking Supervision was published by BNB in October 2015. This plan is intended
to address BCP and audit recommendations in three broad areas: (i) governance and organization of
banking supervision, (ii) regulatory framework and supervisory processes, and (iii) crisis management
and preparedness. This Action Plan is subject to a regular follow-up to support transparency and
accountability in banking supervision.
The governance of banking supervision at the BNB has been revised so as to provide more internal
checks and balances as well as better support for the decision-making. Main changes so far relate to
the increased accountability of the Deputy Governor in charge of banking supervision to the BNB
Governing Council and his reliance on a newly created internal advisory Council on the issues
related to the implementation of supervisory measures. The separation of the on-site and off-site
inspection teams have been completed. Substantial recruitment and training of staff is under way.
The legal framework has been slightly revised to expand BNB’s powers for imposing supervisory
measures (such as dismissing members of Boards or senior management, or replacing bank
auditors). Substantial effort is also being carried out to upgrade the effectiveness of the supervisory
function, with the support of IMF staff. Main efforts aim at finalizing a comprehensive supervisory
manual, which outlines the supervisory process by defining the rights and obligations of the Banking
Supervision Department and its individual directorates and clarifies their interactions. Thereafter
priority will be given to the full review of ordinances, internal rules and supervisory guidelines with
the purpose to enhance them, and align them with Basel principles where necessary. This will
include further work in respect of banks’ governance, internal control and risk management, and the
reduction of connected/related-party lending.

Appendix IV. The Banking Sector Assessment, 2016
The authorities have just completed an assessment of the banking sector. The exercise included
a review of asset quality as of end-2015 and a stress test to assess banks’ resilience to hypothetical
adverse scenarios, while taking account of adjustments arising from the AQR. The assessment was
conducted by the BNB, and about 900 experts were directly involved, including staff from BNB and
those from Deloitte Bulgaria as external consultant and 9 AQR providers. To ensure consistency with
similar exercises, the BNB held periodic discussions with the EC and EBA. The CA covered all
22 banks in the sector, excluding foreign bank branches. On methodology, it broadly followed the
ECB AQR methodology as outlined in the Phase 2 Manual published in March, 2014, except in the
area of the risk-based portfolio selection where supervisors’ local knowledge of Bulgaria’s banking
sector and available supervisory data were factored in. The assets covered by the AQR averaged
about 60 percent and reached 95 percent in some banks to take into account connected lending.
About 75 percent of the banks’ corporate and large SME loan books were individually reviewed.
The results showed that the banking system at the aggregate level is well capitalized and
resilient to adverse shocks even after the AQR adjustments. The total AQR adjustment, of which
most came from the adjustment due to loan provisioning, amounted to BGN 665 million, 1.3 percent
of risk-weighted assets or 0.7 percent of total assets. The impact of these adjustments on the
banking system’s capital adequacy is minimal as it reduced the system’s CET1 capital ratio by merely
1 percentage point to 18.9 percent, well above the sum of regulatory minimum (4.5 percent), capital
conservation buffer (2.5 percent), and systemic risk buffer (3 percent). In the subsequent stress test,
AQR-adjusted capital and risk-weighted assets were shocked by two macroeconomic scenarios over
a three-year horizon (2016–18). Under the baseline scenario, which was consistent with the BNB
macro forecast of March 2016, the banking system’s CET1 capital ratio is expected to improve to
22.2 percent by end-2018. Under the adverse scenario, the banking system’s CET1 capital ratio will
decline to 14.4 percent, suggesting that the banking system’s ability—on an aggregate basis—to
absorb shocks remains strong.
Nevertheless, individual bank results vary considerably. Although all banks stayed above the
regulatory minimum CET 1 capital adequacy ratio, three banks, including the largest domestic bank
FIB, failed to meet the combined capital conservation buffer and systemic risks buffer requirements.
FIB saw its CET1 capital ratio drop to only slightly above the regulatory minimum, resulting in a
shortage of capital buffer of about BGN 205 million (¼ of one percent of GDP). Two small banks
have shortage of capital buffer of BGN 33 million and 3 million, respectively. In the stress test, one
bank under the baseline scenario and a number of banks under the adverse scenario will likely
experience double digit declines in their CET1 ratios by end 2018, raising questions about the
sustainability of their business models.
The BNB has agreed with individual banks on follow up actions. These actions were published
together with the individual bank results. They ranged from recommendations to review and
improve certain policies, procedures, and operational rules to requirements to restore capital buffers
to their required levels. One of the small banks addressed its capital deficiency by additional owner

54

contribution in early 2016. The other two banks have submitted their capital conservation plans to
the BNB, and are expected to restore capital adequacy by end-June 2017. These banks will also be
subject to intensive supervision during this period. While the stress test results are not subject to a
pass/fail threshold, they will be incorporated in the annual Supervisory Review and Evaluation
Process, which, together with the impact of the projection of AQR’s findings on the un-sampled
portfolios, may subsequently lead to changes in banks’ capital plans.

Appendix V. Recent Revenue Administrative and Policy Measures
Single National Strategy
The strong revenue performance since 2015 is underpinned by several tax administrative
measures set out in Single National Strategy for Improving the Tax Collection, Tackling the
Shadow Economy and Reducing the Compliance Costs 2015–17. Its over-arching measures to
enhance tax collection are as follows:








Provide a clear and accurate regulatory framework.
Improve the quality of administrative services.
Use resources relative to risk levels.
Strengthen the quality of the control activity.
Enhance the collection of overdue public claims.
Optimize the provisions on administrative sanctions and penalties.
Improve the processes of eliminating public liabilities.

The strategy also aims for coordinated inter-institutional actions—including the National
Revenue Agency (NRA), Customs Agency (CA), Ministry of Finance (MoF), Ministry of Interior
(MoI), NSSI, NHIF, and other relevant agencies—to ensure the following:






Effective prevention and counteraction of tax fraud and tax evasion.
Effective detection and prevention of tax frauds and of tax evasion schemes.
Effective administrative and criminal proceedings.
Establishment of a common approach for preventing and combating tax frauds and tax evasion.
Improvement of the capacity for control actions which are based on risk assessment and are
supported by effective and efficient information systems.

Enhanced Control of High Risk Goods
The government has enhanced the control of the movement of high fiscal risk goods,
including excisable goods. 41 new fiscal control points were opened in 2015. At the same time, an
intern-institutional coordination center for counteracting smuggling and control was also set up
with a view to ensure the coordination between the CA, NRA, MoI, and other relevant institutions.
Control of the supplies and movement of excisable goods was also strengthened through legislative
amendments in 2015. The main changes include the introduction of (i) requirements in the excise
tax documents to improve reporting and track excisable goods in the supply chain to end uses, (ii)
requirements to use measuring and control devices at the points of entry or departure of energy
products from and to the oil pipeline or oil product pipeline, part of the tax warehouse, to and from
the points of production and /or warehousing, and (iii) bans on using marked fuels for automotive
machines or hating by persons who do not have storage tanks or heating installation.

56

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BULGARIA

Reverse VAT Charge Mechanism
The government introduced a reverse VAT charge mechanism for supplies of cereals and
industrial crops (valid through end-2018), which can be a powerful tool to combat VAT fraud
at early stages of a VAT chain. The EU VAT system is characterized by fractionalized payment—
VAT is collected at each stage of the production and distribution chain after offsetting the input VAT
paid on purchases against the output VAT received on sales. In other words, a supplier of goods and
services (say “Company A”) collects VAT from the customer (say “Company B,” which purchases
goods and services from Company A as inputs for its outputs) and transfers the VAT collected from
Company B to the state while deducting VAT paid to the inputs purchased for producing the goods
and services. Company B, in turn, can deduct the VAT paid to Company A while collecting VAT on its
sales to its customer (say “Company C”). This system, however, is susceptive to “missing trader”
fraud, where, for example, Company B evades paying to the state the VAT collected on sales to
Company C while Company C has the right to deduct VAT on the basis of a valid tax invoice. Under
a reverse VAT charge mechanism, the customer—instead of the supplier—is in charge of paying the
VAT on its own purchases while the equal amount is deducted simultaneously via the same VAT
return. This framework eliminates the cash risks as no actual payment of the VAT takes place.
However, it brings on the retail sector the charge of collecting the VAT due for the whole chain on
the consumption.
In 2014, Bulgaria introduced a reverse VAT charge mechanism for the domestic supplies of
cereals and industrial crops. These sectors are known to be susceptive to VAT fraud not only in
Bulgaria but also in other European countries: for example, “ghost” companies are established and
function during the agricultural campaign and disappear when they should make tax returns and
pay obligations to the state budget, including VAT. The reverse charge mechanism can eliminate
such fraud as “ghost” companies do not receive VAT on their sales. The mechanism is currently
applied for supplies of the concerning products within the territory of Bulgaria that are received by a
VAT registered person and the supplier is a tax liable or non-liable person.
Additional measures have also been implemented to prevent a shift in tax fraud to later
stages of a VAT chain or other economic sectors following the introduction of the reverse VAT
charge mechanism:







Identify the persons using the reverse charge mechanism and strengthened control over their
activities;
Enhance interaction between the NRA and the State Fund Agriculture bodies for exchanging
information on cereal and industrial crops producers and areas sown;
Conduct joint inspections by the NRA and the National Grain and Feed Service of the entities
subject of control, such as agricultural producers, traders, grain storage facilities, public
warehouses and processors;
Strengthen control over the cereal and industrial crops processing sectors; and
Strengthen control over the export of cereal and industrial crops and over the transport vehicles
transporting cereal and industrial crops, such as trucks, railway wagons, and ships.

Increases in Excise Duty Rates
The strong revenue performance has also been supported by increases in excise duty rates.
The government has been raising gradually the rates for energy products used as heating fuel and
cigarettes during 2015–18. The increases in the excises also have positive effects on VAT on the
excisable goods.

Appendix VI. Summary of the 2015 Pension Reforms
Pillar 1 Parametric Reforms


Increase the contribution rates by 1 percentage point each year in 2017 and 2018 (combined
employer and employee) for old-age, survivors, and disability benefits from 17.8 percent to
19.8 percent for those who contribute only to Pillar 1 (from 12.8 percent to 14.8 percent for
those who contribute to both Pillar 1 and 2 while the contribution rate for Pillar 2 remains
unchanged at 5 percent).



Raise the retirement age for women and men to 65 from currently 60 years and 8 months for
women and 63 years and 8 months for men: (i) women—by 2 months per year until 2029, and
by 3 months from 2030 until 2037; and (ii) men—by 2 months in 2016 and 2017 and starting
from 2018 by 1 month per calendar year until 2029. Thereafter, the retirement age will be linked
to the increase in life expectancy.



Raise the retirement age for miners, pilots, and workers in nuclear power plants to 55 from the
current retirement ages of 52 years and 8 months for men and 47 years and 8 months for
women.



Increase the required length of service for retirement of employees by 2 months per year until
2027, reaching 40 years for men and 37 years for women.



For employees with insufficient length of service (but no less than 15 years of actual pensionable
service) the retirement age for men and women will grow smoothly until reaching 67 years of
age in 2029: (i) in 2016 and 2017 growth will be 2 months per year; (ii) from 2018 it will continue
to rise by 1 month per year.



Improve the adequacy of pensions through modifying (i) the individual coefficient and (ii) the
weight of the length of service for the benefit formula from 1.2 to 1.5 by 2026.



Allow people with disabilities who were born after December 31, 1959 and currently receiving
disability pensions move their accumulated assets from Pillar 2 to Pillar 1 in order to receive
higher pension benefits today. Their pension from Pillar 2 will otherwise be available only when
they reach the retirement age.

Introduction of Unlimited Shifts Between Pillar 1 and Pillar 2


Under the new rule, people are allowed to shift between Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 unlimitedly until five
years before the retirement. If an individual decides to shift from Pillar 2 to Pillar 1, his assets will
be transferred to the government (the Silver Fund) but maintained under his unique account so

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 59

BULGARIA

that he can shift his assets back to Pillar 2 if he decides to do so. While being maintained by the
Silver Fund, the transferred Pillar 2 assets do not earn interest.


Regardless of the time vested in Pillar 2, an individual whose final decision is to permanently
shift to the Pillar 1 system will receive undiscounted amount of pension benefits from Pillar 1,
which will be broadly equivalent to 60 percent of his social security income.



The framework provides incentive for people to maximize Pillar 2 assets throughout the career
and decide at the latest possible timing—five years before the retirement—whether to switch to
Pillar 1 or not by comparing the amount of Pillar 2 assets to give up and projected additional
Pillar 1 benefits to receive from switching.



Given no interest will be earned on the assets transferred from Pillar 2 to Pillar 1, frequent
switches between Pillar 1 and 2 are likely limited in normal times—when investment returns of
Pillar 2 are positive.

Appendix VII. The Belene Case
1.
On June 14, 2016, the International Arbitration Court’s ruling ordered Bulgaria’s stateowned National Electricity Company (NEK)—100 percent owned by a state-owned Bulgaria
Energy Holding (BEH)—to pay the amounts due to Russia’s Atomstroyexport for the equipment
already produced for the cancelled Belene Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) project. The court declined
other claims, such as the escalating price claims, lost profits for expenses incurred beyond the
subject contract, and demobilization costs. The NEK’s obligation amounts to EUR 646 million
(including principal and accumulated interests) by end-2016 and will further accumulate interest
at an annual rate of about 10 percent if not paid.
2.
The history of the Belene NPP project goes back to the 1970s. The plant was expected to
be built 3 km from Belene in northern Bulgaria as Bulgaria’s second NPP. The Belene site was
approved for construction by a Council of Ministers decree on March 20, 1981. By 1990,
40 percent of the construction work of reactor 1 was finished and 80 percent of the equipment
was supplied. However, the project was abandoned in 1990 due to the restoration of capitalism in
Bulgaria.
3.
In 2004, the Council of Ministers decided to resume the construction of the Belene NPP
with maximum installed capacity of 2000 MW, which in 2005 was decided to be a national priority.
In October 2006, NEK and Russian’s Atomstroyexport, which was the contractor selected through a
competitive procurement procedure, signed an agreement whereby the parties would conclude a
future contract for engineering, procurement, and construction of the Belene NPP. The deadline
for signing the contract was repeatedly extended, and never signed.
4.
In 2008, absent a contract, production of equipment (e.g., reactor, installation, stream
generators, systems of passive protection, refueling machine, turbine installation) for the plant
started in accordance with an Appendix to the 2006 agreement. For the production, the Bulgarian
government made an advance payment amounting to EUR 89 million in 2008.
5.
In 2012, the Council of Ministers decided to discontinue the Belene NPP project, which
was also supported by Parliament. Meanwhile, the International Arbitration Court initiated the
arbitration proceedings.
6.
The Bulgarian government’s current priority is to prevent further accumulation of interest
on NEK’s obligation as a priority. To do so, the Parliament has recently adopted a special law to
extend an uncollateralized interest-free loan to NEK by mobilizing the government deposits. The
implementation of the law is conditional to the EC’s positive opinion. At the same time, the
government is exploring a permanent solution—that is to remove the equipment from NEK’s
balance sheet. The Ministry of Energy indicated that options for the permanent solution include (i)
selling the equipment to a third country, and (ii) resume the project by attracting private investors.
The former option requires Atomstroyexport’s agreement.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
The World Bank has been leading the policy dialogue on structural and institutional reforms
in support of accelerating Bulgaria’s convergence to EU income levels. On May 19, 2016 the
Board of Directors endorsed the Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Bulgaria of the World
Bank Group (WBG) which outlined the roadmap for the WBG’s country support for the period FY17FY22. The CPF marks a renewed engagement with Bulgaria, including the first new lending
operations since FY11. The program sets out a selective engagement with ambitious objectives in
two key areas with strong government ownership and demand for the WBG support. Within these
two broad areas of engagement the program identifies five objectives. The first area on
“Strengthening institutions for sustainable growth” aims to: (i) Improve resilience and stability of the
financial sector; (ii) Strengthen electricity sector and improved energy efficiency; and (iii) Better
protect natural assets and improved efficiency in use of resources. Objectives of the second area on
“Investing in people” are: (i) Enhanced school outcomes for better employability, and (ii) Improved
access to essential services (housing, water, ECD, long-term care) for bottom 40 and marginalized
groups. The objectives are strongly correlated with the WBG’s twin goals of poverty reduction and
shared prosperity.

A. International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)
Bulgaria’s active portfolio consists of active investment projects totaling US$430 million in
net commitments, which are complemented by Bank-funded analytical pieces and RASs.
The two active investment projects focus on the development of municipal infrastructure and
the strengthening of the deposit insurance fund.
Analytical tasks include an assessment of Bulgaria’s Housing Sector; a Poverty and Social Impact
Analysis of improving energy efficiency in Bulgaria; an assessment on how to improve access to
essential services, such as education, water, housing, health and long-term care and social
welfare; a study on citizen engagement; an update of the Bulgaria FSAP (in collaboration with
the IMF); and a Spending Review. In addition, there are two EC funded regional tasks on Poverty
Mapping and Sub-national Doing Business under implementation.
There are six Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS) under implementation and one task is at an
advanced stage of preparation Reimbursable Advisory Services cover key areas of engagement.
Under the current programming period, the World Bank is providing advice on policy
formulation and strategy development in climate change adaptation; shared services; preuniversity education; water and sanitation services, energy sector reform.

B. International Finance Corporation (IFC)
As of June 2016, the IFC had 39 projects (completed and ongoing) in Bulgaria with total
commitments of over US$975 million. The single biggest investment of IFC in the country is in the
retail sector in the form of a loan for the expansion and improvement of energy efficiency of the
largest discount supermarket chain in Bulgaria. Its buildings are awarded with certificate for highest
environmental performance. IFC was also involved in the development of the Galata gas field near
the Black sea cost, helping diversification of natural gas supply. In line with the IFC’s strategic goals
for Bulgaria, IFC has supported a company investing in agricultural land and promoting land
consolidation. In the financial sector, IFC had supported two specialized SME banks; helps trade
operations through its Global Trade Finance Program; it established Bulgaria’s first micro-lending
bank and has invested in a venture fund, which is also targeting the SME sector. In other industries,
IFC had contributed to key manufacturing projects—it has supported the modernization and
expansion of an electronics producer, particle board producer, a large steel mill, and two glass
processing plants. IFC maintains large portfolio in renewable energy in the country, including
investments in the largest wind and photovoltaic power producers. Some IFC projects entail an
important environmental component. One of the manufacturing plants, for example, is purchasing
equipment which would reduce its GHG emissions and the electronics producing company is
making sensors for cars that monitor the emission of polluting gases and improve fuel efficiency.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Bulgaria—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
As of October 13, 2016
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance purposes.
National Accounts

The National Statistical Institute (NSI) is responsible for compiling national accounts, based
on a system consistent with the System of National Accounts 2008 (SNA 2008) and the
European System of Accounts 2010. GDP data by activity and expenditure categories are
compiled and reconciled within an annual supply and use framework. Government output and
final consumption are estimated on an accrual basis. Published national accounts include
production, income, and capital accounts for the five resident institutional sectors (general
government and its sub-sectors, financial corporations, non-financial corporations, nonprofit
institutions serving households, and households). The NSI publishes financial accounts and
balance sheets by institutional sectors and sub-sectors on an annual basis.
The flow of customs data has improved significantly in recent years and a new system for
processing customs records is near completion. The development of export and import unit
value indices is progressing smoothly and additional support is expected from Eurostat in this
area. The current indices are used as deflators for the import and export components of the
national accounts. Each month the Foreign Trade Statistics Department of the NSI is in contact
with the BNB to review data issues and ensure consistency between the NSI export and import
data and the balance of payments data.
Labor Market Statistics

Data on employment and hours worked are compiled by the NSI based on a Labor Force
Survey and Enterprises’ survey on employment—“Quarterly survey on employees, hours
worked, wages and salaries, and other expenditures paid by the employers” (QLCS) and “Annual
enterprises survey on employment, wages and salaries, and other labor cost” are adjusted
according to the ESA2010 methodology. The NSI current monthly and quarterly estimates are
based on the results from the sample– QLCS. The QLCS sample includes 13100 private sector
enterprises out of approximately 203000. The public sector enterprises are covered exhaustively
except for the schools and kindergartens for which a sample is drown as well from 2008. The NSI
household labor force survey provide average quarterly results and is an alternative source of
data, but the methodological discrepancies between household and establishment survey need to
be taken into account (especially regarding agricultural employment). .

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BULGARIA

The NSI also compiles and publishes quarterly wage data for various economic sectors. The
main shortcomings include: (i) under-reporting of private sector wages; and (ii) reporting of
average gross earnings only and not wages by occupation. Since 2002, a survey on earnings
(Structure of Earnings Survey – SES) is conducted every four years providing information about
average monthly and hourly earnings by economic activity, occupation, gender and education.
The household budget survey provides an alternative source of data for private sector wages.
A Population Census was conducted in early 2011 and is a source for redesigning the
household surveys conducted by the NSI, particularly the household budget survey and the
labor force survey.
Price Statistics

The NSI produces a monthly consumer price index (CPI), harmonized consumer price index
(HICP) according to Eurostat methods, and a producer price index (PPI). The CPI series began
in 1995, the PPI in 2000 and the HICP in 2005 (for earlier years it is set equal to the CPI). The CPI’s
geographical coverage of the index is restricted to 27 urban areas that account for an estimated
65 percent of sales. A monthly PPI covers the mining and manufacturing industries, the
production and distribution of electricity and steam, and natural gas and air conditioning supply.
Government Finance Statistics

In recent years, following the recommendations of a combined STA/FAD mission and within
the framework of EU fiscal reporting , the authorities have made significant progress in
implementing accrual accounting for government, budgetary and statistical systems.
Consolidated data on a cash basis, covering general government and its subsector operations,
were routinely reported for publication in the GFS Yearbook/Annual CD-ROM and in the IFS. In
addition, quarterly accrual GFS data for the whole general government are reported for
publication in the IFS, through Eurostat. The major part of the GFS data is compiled by the NSI
and the transmissions to Eurostat are carried out by the NSI. Since September 2008, the Ministry
of Finance (MOF) prepares and submits the SDDS monthly indicators for the central government
finances in the IMF’s GFSM 2001 format. Since June 2016 general government operations for the
SDDS Plus are prepared quarterly on accrual basis by the NSI and the BNB. High frequency data
filled in Statement II (Sources and Uses of Cash) template in the GFSM 2001 format are published
on the MOF’s website on a monthly and quarterly basis. As of 2014, the Bulgarian statistical
authorities (NSI, BNB and MoF) agreed to use the provided option by Eurostat for IMF data
transmission. In this way GFS data become consistent with the ESA/EDP data not only by adding
accrual data, but also in terms of scope, including all units of GG sector in accordance with ESA
rules. The Bulgarian National Statistical Institute as the institution responsible for compiling GFS
tables under ESA’2010 has confirmed to Eurostat to use data from ESA tables 6 and 7 (flows and
stocks data of assets and liabilities) for reporting the annual GFS to IMF. The data for Statement II
of the IMF GFS Yearbooks on a cash basis are still submitted by the MOF. Since 2015 it has been
presented in the IMF GFSM 2014 format.

BULGARIA

The Ministry of Finance prepares data on the execution of the consolidated government
budget on a monthly and quarterly basis, following the national presentation. These data
are not according to GFS standards. Aggregate data on revenue, expenditure, balance of the
general government and composition of financing (in national formats) are published with a
monthly bulletin and posted on the MOF’s website, in addition to the GFSM 2001 data. Progress
has been made in presenting data on a disaggregated basis, including expenditure by functional
classification. In addition, a full economic classification of expenditure is now available, and the
authorities have provided such data on an annual basis back to 1998.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: The BNB reports monetary data for publication in the IFS based
on the ECB framework for the collection and compilation of monetary data, beginning with data
starting in February 2004. Data comply with the MFSM methodology, with some minor deviations
documented in the IFS metadata. Data for other financial corporations are not currently reported
to the IMF.
Financial Sector Surveillance: Bulgaria participates in the financial soundness indicators (FSIs)
project. Annual data are posted on the FSI website for the period 2005–15.
External Sector Statistics

Bulgaria provides quarterly balance of payments (BOP) statistics for dissemination in IFS on
a timely basis. Balance of payments and international investment position (IIP) statistics are
compiled according to the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual,
sixth edition (BPM6) and reported to STA on quarterly basis. The BNB publishes monthly balance
of payments data and quarterly international investment position data on its official website in
accordance with the Statistical Data Release Calendar. Since joining the EU in January 2007, the
trade data with EU countries are being collected following the INTRASTAT system. The flow of
customs data has improved significantly in recent years and a new system for processing customs
records is near completion. Each month the Foreign Trade Statistics Department of the NSI is in
contact with the BNB to review data issues and ensure consistency between the NSI export and
import data and the balance of payments data. Data for imports and exports of goods with nonEU member states are based on SAD (Single Administrative Document) collected by Customs
Agency while the movement of goods within the EU is based on Intrastat declarations collected
by the National Revenue Agency. The Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign
Currency Liquidity is disseminated monthly and quarterly external debt data are reported to the
World Bank for re-dissemination in the Quarterly External Debt Statistics (QEDS) database. In line
with the Special Data Dissemination Standard Plus (SDDS Plus) requirements, Bulgaria participates
in: (i) the Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS) with inward data separately identifying
equity and debt instruments positions and providing further breakdown of gross asset and
liability debt instrument positions; (ii) the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS)
providing semiannual core data as well as the following encouraged items: currency of
denomination, sector of the holder, liabilities, sector of the issuer, and cross-sectors classifications;
and (iii) the Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves (COFER).
II. Data Standards and Quality

Bulgaria started to adhere to the SDDS Plus in 2016.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION— SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Prepared By

European Department

The purpose of this supplement is to inform the Board about recent revisions of
Bulgaria’s national accounts and the latest economic developments. This information
does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
Revised national accounts data from Bulgaria’s National Statistical
Institute show higher real and nominal GDP growth in 2015. Real GDP growth was
revised up from 3.0 to 3.6 percent for 2015 and from 3.0 to 3½ percent for the first half
of 2016 (y/y). Domestic demand, especially private consumption, turned out to be
stronger in 2015 than suggested by the previous data, while the contribution from net
exports was weaker. Along the same lines, the current account surplus in 2015 was
revised downward by about 1 percentage point of GDP, as a slightly better service
balance was not enough to offset lower trade and primary income balances. The GDP
deflator was also revised up, resulting in an upward revision of 2015 nominal GDP
growth by 2½ percentage points. The text table shows key changes in the data.1

BULGARIA

2.
Based on the revised data, staff has raised the GDP growth projection for
2016 to 3¼ percent from 3 percent in the staff report. This change reflects
increased carryover from 2015 and the stronger outturn for the first half of 2016. The
projections for medium-term actual growth and potential growth were maintained at
around 2½ percent as the longer term constraints to higher growth as laid out in the
staff report remain unchanged (see paragraph 8 of the staff report). The revised
growth projection does not change staff’s overall assessment about Bulgaria’s external
position in 2015 (see Annex I of staff report) or about the country’s debt sustainability
(see Annex II of the staff report).
3.
The revision to nominal GDP implies a small improvement in key
macroeconomic ratios. For example, as a result of the higher denominator, the
2015 government debt-to-GDP ratio declined to 25.6 percent of GDP (from
26.3 percent previously), and the 2015 fiscal cash deficit fell to 2.8 percent of GDP
(compared to 2.9 percent). Similarly, the external debt dropped to 76.1 percent of GDP
(from 78.1 percent previously). Staff projections for government and external debt and
fiscal deficit in terms of GDP have also been revised slightly downward. A complete set
of tables with the revised historical data and updated projections is attached.
4.
Based on new releases staff has also slightly raised the inflation projection
for 2016. Recent data releases show a decelerating pace of declines in energy and
transportation prices. Incorporating these data, staff has revised up the average HICP
inflation projection for 2016 to -1.3 percent from -1.6 percent in the staff report.

Statement by Anthony De Lannoy, Executive Director for Bulgaria
and Tsvetan Manchev, Advisor to Executive Director
November 4, 2016
The Bulgarian authorities had a constructive dialogue with the mission during the 2016
Article IV consultation, and thank staff for the papers. Since the authorities broadly agree
with staff that they should continue their policies aimed at increasing resilience against
ongoing domestic and external challenges, we would like to make the following points for
emphasis.
Amid the high global and regional uncertainty, the authorities continue to build their policies
around the currency board monetary regime, which remains the cornerstone for anchoring
macroeconomic, monetary and financial stability. The authorities maintain macroeconomic
stability, and aim to strengthen the medium term growth prospects of the economy. The 2016
fiscal consolidation is ahead of schedule, mainly thanks to the higher-than-initially expected
growth and comprehensive administrative revenue measures. The coalition government also
works hard to reduce contingent liabilities, improve public confidence in the reform process,
and further strengthen the EU funds’ utilization. The Bulgarian National Bank (BNB)
continues with the decisive actions to further strengthen confidence in the banking system
through implementing its comprehensive plan for strengthening the banking supervision, and
addressing issues identified by the recent asset quality review (AQR) and stress test.
Recent Macroeconomic Developments and Outlook
The authorities generally share staff’s view on the macroeconomic developments and
remain cautious in their outlook given the high uncertainty in the external
environment. As highlighted by staff, Bulgaria’s recent economic performance has been by
far stronger than initially anticipated. Going forward, the authorities will implement an action
plan to improve the business environment and advance the anti-corruption agenda in order to
attract more private investment.
The deflationary pressures are related to the impact of international prices and they are
gradually easing. The labor market continues to tighten. Active labor market policies will
continue to stimulate labor force participation and mitigate the effect from emigration. In line
with staff’s advice, these measures will encompass better protection of the poor. In this
regard, staff’s analysis on the fiscal implications stemming from demographic changes is
very helpful.
Financial Stability
Since the last Article IV Consultation the central bank has focused on improving
banking supervision, implementing the institutional framework for bank resolution and
conducting AQR and stress tests in the banking sector. Progress in all three areas has
been significant.

2
In 2015, the IMF and the WB, together with the central bank, undertook an assessment
of compliance of supervisory regulations and practices with the Basel Core Principles
(BCP). Following the BCP assessment, the BNB adopted a detailed Plan on Reforms and
Development of Banking Supervision in October 2015. This plan envisages coordinated
actions in three areas - governance and organization of banking supervision, regulatory
framework and supervisory processes, and crisis management and preparedness. So far, the
legal framework and governance of banking supervision have been strengthened, and the
Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process Manual has been created in line with the
decisions of the European Banking Authority on common procedures and methodologies.
The authorities have taken steps to strengthen crisis resolution management by
transposing the European Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) into
Bulgarian law in mid-August 2015. The BNB swiftly established a new directorate on bank
resolution. In August 2016, as mandated and scheduled under the 2015 Law on Recovery and
Resolution of Credit Institutions and Investment Firms, the BNB concluded an AQR and
stress test of the banking system. The AQR has confirmed the comfortable position of banks’
balance sheets as of end-2015, as only minor adjustments have appeared necessary to be
reflected in the banks’ 2016 financial statements (BGN 665 million, or 1.3% of the total riskweighted assets). The impact of these adjustments has already been mitigated, after taking
into consideration the amount of realized net income and additional impairments in the banks
performed until mid-2016, as well as relevant capital-related developments and measures by
banks throughout 2016. The results of the stress test confirmed the strong capital position and
resilience to shocks of the banking system. The AQR and stress test and their results were
positively reflected by the international financial institutions, markets, credit rating agencies,
and professional analysts.
Since the last Article IV Consultation, several other policies have been implemented to
strengthen financial stability. In 2015, the BNB successfully contained the spillovers from
Greece and the domestic banking system remained stable. The BNB measures focused on
close monitoring and oversight over the individual bank liquidity management and ex-ante
steps to forestall spillovers and strengthen liquidity requirements. In the first half of 2016, the
Bulgarian Deposit Insurance Fund (BDIF) signed agreements with the WB and the EBRD for
two government-guaranteed loans that will be used to repay the BDIF loan from the Ministry
of Finance. With regard to the non-banking financial system, the Financial Supervision
Commission intends to complete an AQR of the pension funds and insurance companies and
a stress test of the insurance and re-insurance industry by the end-2016. In the second half of
the 2016, an IMF/WB FSAP started and its results will be presented to the IMF Board in
May 2017.
Fiscal Sustainability
In the highly uncertain and volatile external environment, the government remains
committed to a conservative medium-term fiscal consolidation strategy. The 2016 fiscal
consolidation is proceeding faster than expected due to inter alia the unanticipated
acceleration of the economic activity, better revenue collection, and a slower start of the

3
implementation of the 2014-2020 EU budgetary framework. The authorities are committed to
save the 2016 revenue over performance in order to strengthen fiscal buffers and contain
cyclicality of the private demand. The return to a structurally balanced budget by 2019 would
allow the automatic stabilizers to work while the government builds up liquidity buffers in
good times and contains further debt accumulation.
The preparation of the 2017 budget is at an advanced stage. The consolidated
government deficit is projected at 1.4 percent of GDP on cash basis, and the structural deficit
will further decline and reach 0.5 percent to GDP. In line with the long-standing public
consensus, Bulgaria maintains a predictable tax system, and the 2017 tax policy and tax-toGDP ratio will remain broadly unchanged. Given that Bulgaria’s public pension system has
relatively low contribution collection and income replacement rates, the social security
contributions will be increased by one percentage point in the next two years. As described in
the staff report, the next steps in the public education and health care reforms will be
implemented to achieve a more targeted and efficient public expenditure and to enhance the
productivity of public investment. The recently-enacted Public Procurement Act in line with
the well-established European practices will help reducing public procurement deficiencies.
In 2017, Bulgaria does not plan to tap into international financial markets, and domestic debt
operations will be limited to the refinancing of the matured securities.
The authorities are fully aware of the increasing medium- and long-term fiscal
pressures stemming from the adverse demographic trends, contingent liabilities of the
state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and subnational governments, and other structural
rigidities. The budget procedure has already been amended to include the state-owned
enterprises in the General Government sector and ensure better monitoring of their impact on
the budgetary balance and government debt position. In line with the international practices,
a mechanism for financial recovery of the municipalities has been introduced through
amendments in the Public Finance Law. In 2016, the members of the Fiscal Council were
appointed, and the Parliament set up conditions for its functioning in order to get a better and
deeper understanding of various fiscal risks and attribution. Going forward, the authorities
also remain open to discuss and implement best international practices in the corporate
governance, output quality, and financial performance of the SOEs.
Structural Reforms
Emigration of young people and skilled labor, continues to be a key challenge. It will be
comprehensively addressed by promoting child care support, enhancing vocational training
and skill development to improve the employability of workers, and rationalizing
administrative procedures. In the same vein, legislative amendments will be launched to
enhance synergy between social services and health care system, and the authorities will
proceed with a gradual increase of the statutory retirement ages.
In late 2015, the widespread discontent among the population about the perceived
unfairness of the public pension system was addressed by a reform package creating an
automatic link between the statutory retirement ages and the life expectancy once the
statutory retirement age reaches 65 years. To reduce the deficit in the public pension

4
system, however, the authorities will continue active labor market policies to ensure old-age
employment, while striking the right balance between ensuring fiscal sustainability and
preventing old-age poverty.
The government is also committed to boosting productivity by further improvements in
the EU funds’ absorption during the existing program period. The implementation of the
new Public Procurement Act adopted in April 2016 will enhance the ex-ante control and eprocurement procedures. A comprehensive set of measures to strengthen the administrative
capacity and to broaden the electronic public services is also underway. In June 2016 the
Law on Electronic Governance was adopted, and in September the government created an
independent state agency with a mandate to oversee other governmental structures in charge
of e-government development.
