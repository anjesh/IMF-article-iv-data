INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
UNITED KINGDOM
Staff Report for the 2011 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2011 Consultation with the United Kingdom
Approved by Ajai Chopra and Tamim Bayoumi
July 12, 2011
Context. Implementation of a wide-ranging policy program is underway, aiding the post-crisis
repair of the economy. However, the recovery stalled over the last several months, inflation
remains elevated, and unemployment is still unacceptably high. The financial system has
stabilized and bank balance sheet repair continues, but this process is not complete and is
vulnerable to setbacks.
Macroeconomic policy mix. The weakness in growth and rise in inflation raises the question
whether it is time to adjust macroeconomic policies. The answer is no, as the deviations are
largely temporary. Strong fiscal consolidation is underway and remains essential to achieve a
more sustainable budgetary position, thus reducing fiscal risks. The inflation overshoot is
driven largely by transitory factors, and hence maintaining the current scale of monetary
stimulus is appropriate given fiscal adjustment and subdued wage growth. This macroeconomic
policy mix will also assist in rebalancing the economy toward sustainable growth led by
investment and external demand.
Risk scenarios. Nonetheless, there are significant risks to inflation, growth, and unemployment
arising from uncertainties surrounding sovereign turmoil in parts of the euro area, headwinds
from fiscal policy, volatile commodity prices, and the housing market. Policy flexibility will be
essential to respond to shocks, with the appropriate response depending on the nature of the
shock. For example, if there is mounting evidence that weak demand is likely to cause the
economy to stall and enter a period of prolonged low growth and subdued inflation, a
significant loosening of macroeconomic policies will be required.
Financial sector policy. Strong domestic measures and international coordination are needed
to further bolster financial stability. Indeed, the stability and efficiency of the UK financial
system is a “global public good” due to potential spillovers and thus requires the highest
quality of supervision and regulation. In this context, continued build up of capital and liquidity
buffers ahead of Basel III requirements is essential.
Mission details. The Article IV team comprised Mr. Chopra (head), Messrs. Fletcher, Kannan,
and Takizawa, and Ms. Ruiz-Arranz (all EUR). Ms. Pazarbasioglu (MCM) joined the mission
to discuss conclusions of the Financial Sector Stability Assessment. Mr. Marston and
Ms. Mateos y Lago (both SPR) joined to discuss conclusions of the Spillover Report. The
mission’s concluding statement was published on June 6, 2011 and can be found at

I. FOCUS OF THE CONSULTATION
1.
Recovery from the financial crisis is underway, but is bumpy and incomplete.
Output is still 4 percent below its peak in March 2008, a gap that is the third largest in the G7
after Italy and Japan, and growth was flat in the six months from October 2010. At the same
time, headline inflation is elevated at 4¼ percent, although core inflation excluding the
effects of VAT hikes is more tame at about 1¼ percent. Bank balance sheet repair continues
and bank lending conditions are less tight, but credit growth remains soft. The centerpiece of
the government’s economic strategy—strong fiscal consolidation to preserve confidence in
debt sustainability—is in progress.1
2.
The challenge going forward is to ensure sustainable recovery and balance sheet
repair while remaining flexible to respond to shocks. Specifically, the goals are to move
the economy to a more balanced and sustainable equilibrium, return inflation to target,
reduce unemployment and close the output gap, ensure fiscal sustainability, and move to a
safer financial system. Against this background, the focus of the consultation was on the
following issues and questions:


What is the progress and outlook on rebalancing demand and financial sector
deleveraging? (Section II)



In view of the progress and outlook on these fronts, what is the central scenario for the
economy? Is the recent slowdown in growth and rise in inflation largely temporary?
What are the key risks and uncertainties around the central scenario? (Section III)



Is it time to adjust monetary or fiscal policy in light of the weakness in growth and rise in
inflation? (Section IV)



How should monetary and fiscal policy react if risks materialize? (Section V)



What remains to be done to bolster the financial system’s soundness, strengthen the
oversight framework, and fortify the capacity to deal with systemically important
financial institutions? What are the potential spillovers from the UK’s large and
interconnected financial system? (Section VI)

3.
The focus on these issues occurs against a backdrop of two concurrent IMF
reports on the UK. The first is a Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA) update under
1

Policies over the last year have been broadly in line with recommendations of past Article IV consultations. In
particular, the government has implemented strong fiscal consolidation together with an accommodative
monetary stance, a policy mix supported by Directors during the 2010 Article IV consultation. The framework
for financial regulation and supervision has also been strengthened, as recommended by Directors, though
further progress is necessary.

5
the IMF’s Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), which analyzes financial sector
health and associated policies. The second is a Spillover Report, which analyzes spillovers
emanating from UK policies to the rest of the world. This staff report discusses and integrates
the key points of these documents.
II. THE MACROECONOMIC SETTING
A. Rebalancing Demand
4.
Economic recovery was strong for most of 2010, but slowed in recent quarters.
Recovery from the deep recession of 2008-09 was led by a classic turn in the inventory cycle
and rebounding private investment (Figures 1 and 2). Together, these forces fueled average
GDP growth of 2¾ percent (saar) in the first
10
70

three quarters of 2010. However, growth
(yoy percent change, unless otherwise indicated)
turned flat in late 2010/early 2011.2 This

slowdown partly reflects intensifying fiscal
consolidation—most notably with a

5.
Fiscal headwinds will continue as the government moves toward a more
sustainable fiscal position. The financial crisis pushed the overall fiscal deficit to 11 percent
of GDP in FY09/10, a post-war record and one of the highest deficits in the world. With
public finances on a clearly unsustainable path, the June 2010 budget laid out a 5-year
adjustment plan that would cut the deficit to 1½ percent of GDP by FY15/16. Progress was
made in FY10/11, with the deficit dropping to 9¾ percent of GDP; further deficit reduction
(to 8 percent of GDP) is expected in FY11/12.
6.
The necessary increase in public saving implies that growth must rely on private
sector-led demand. Specifically, increased demand must come from some combination of
lower private saving (higher private consumption), higher private investment, and higher net
exports. Recent developments and prospects for each of these items are examined in turn.
2

Unusually cold weather temporarily lowered GDP in Q4 2010, with an offsetting rebound in Q1 2011. As a
result, average GDP growth over Q4 2010-Q1 2011, which was zero, is free from weather effects and provides
a better view of the underlying trend than the noisier quarterly numbers.

Private consumption
7.
Private consumption has remained weak as households have faced a marked
tightening in real disposable income. Nominal wage growth has remained sluggish over the
past year given low productivity growth and continued slack in the labor market. Higher
commodity prices and indirect taxes have further reduced households’ real incomes. These
factors, along with a weak housing market, pushed consumer confidence in early 2011 down
to levels last seen during the depths of the crisis, though it has rebounded somewhat in recent
months (Figure 1).
8.
House prices are likely to weigh on consumption going forward. During the boom,
rising house prices helped boost consumption and cut the household saving rate to only
2 percent (Figure 3). Although these trends sharply reversed during the crisis, housing
valuation ratios are still about 30 percent above their historical averages. Some softness in
house prices thus seems likely going forward. But unlike the US or Spain, new home
construction in the UK remained relatively muted during the boom due to the UK’s tight
planning restrictions (Figure 4). As a result, supply constraints are likely to prevent house
prices from fully falling back to their historical averages. In addition, if real interest rates
remain below their historical average—as expected by markets even in the medium term
(Section IV.B)—then housing valuation metrics are also unlikely to revert fully to their
historical averages. On balance, staff’s central scenario assumes a reduction in the house
price-to-income ratio of 12 percent over the medium term (though house prices still rise
slightly in nominal terms). Indeed, house prices have already started retreating again in
recent quarters. An econometric analysis of the UK’s saving rate suggests that upward
pressure on the saving rate from subdued house prices should be offset by the fiscal
consolidation, which should depress private saving, resulting in a broadly flat household
saving rate over the medium term (Box 1 and companion Selected Issues paper).

Box 1. What Is Driving the Household Saving Rate in the UK?
40

The UK’s household saving rate has long been
relatively low. The gross household saving rate
averaged only 4.4 percent in the UK in the ten years
through 2009, the lowest rate among G7 economies.

difference between the UK saving rate and the
average for G7 countries in the past decade can be explained by these variables. An estimated model
shows that increases in the value of the housing stock and declines in the real long-term interest rate
drove much of the secular decline in the saving rate through 2007, although a house price correction and
spike in the fiscal deficit in 2008-09 are estimated to have undone the entire decline in the past decade.
The model suggests that the ongoing fiscal consolidation and house price movements will be key
determinants of the saving rate going forward. Specifically, the model suggests that the fiscal
consolidation will reduce the saving rate by about 3½ percentage points by 2016. This need not occur
through hyper-rational Ricardian effects—i.e., households saving less today in anticipation of lower
taxes tomorrow—but could simply reflect sticky household consumption in the face of higher
taxes/lower transfers that reduce household income. The central scenario also assumes that the house
price-to-income ratio falls by 12 percent as valuations fall closer to their historical average. This,
together with a modest increase in real interest rates and roughly no change in the other explanatory
variables, keeps the saving rate broadly flat (it falls just slightly) over the medium term. However, the
saving rate could veer significantly from this central scenario if house prices deviate significantly from
central scenario assumptions.

Private investment

The outlook for private investment is brighter. After falling to unsustainably low
levels during the crisis, investment rebounded in 2010. Staff expects this trend to continue
over the medium term, with the investment-to-GDP 30

10.
Significant depreciation at the onset of the crisis has not yet translated into rapid
net export growth. The CPI-based real effective exchange rate (REER) depreciated by some
25 percent between mid-2007 and early 2009 (Figure 5). Based on standard IMF
methodologies, sterling now appears to be broadly in line with fundamentals. However, the
depreciation has not resulted in a sustained narrowing of the current account deficit.
Although goods export volumes have expanded solidly during the recovery, growth of
service exports has been weaker, as global deleveraging has hindered growth of financial
services. Meanwhile, a low degree of import substitution has kept import volumes elevated.
As a result, the current account deficit stands at 3 percent of GDP, the same as its pre-crisis
level. The UK’s low labor productivity growth during the crisis due to labor hoarding
(Section III.A), which has caused the unit labor cost (ULC)-based REER to appreciate
considerably more than the CPI-based REER, may provide a partial explanation for weak net
export performance. Indeed, the ULC-based measure is nearly back to levels observed in the
mid-2000s. This interpretation gives some hope for current account adjustment going
forward, as UK relative labor productivity may improve as labor hoarding unwinds. If it does
not, sterling may be more overvalued than suggested by standard IMF methodologies.

In any case, fiscal adjustment plans give a strong reason to expect a narrowing
of the current account deficit going forward. Fiscal consolidations are associated with
current account adjustments, both because they compress domestic demand directly (indeed,
domestic demand growth is projected to be lower in the UK than its trading partners in the
coming years) and because fiscal consolidation allows looser monetary policy, which helps
keep the exchange rate competitive.

this implies that the current account
deficit might fall by about 2½ percent of GDP over this period, bringing the current account
close to balance. The latest GDP outturn (Q1 2011) is encouraging in this regard, with net
exports contributing 1.3 percentage points to q-o-q GDP growth.
12.
Prospects for orderly rebalancing toward private sector-led growth will depend
in part on the pace of financial sector healing. Recent developments and the outlook in this
area are examined next.
B. Financial Sector Deleveraging
13.
Banks have buttressed their balance sheets over the last year (Figures 6-7). With
core tier 1 ratios above 10 percent, all major banks are ahead of schedule in their transition to
Basel III rules. Banks are addressing the funding vulnerabilities that lay behind the crisis by
reducing their reliance on wholesale funding, increasing the share of stable customer
deposits, and lengthening the duration of their liabilities. In doing so, UK banks have
accounted for over a quarter of the deleveraging of global cross-border lending since the start
of the crisis. There has also been also been a modest shift in the composition of assets in
favor of liquid instruments and away from riskier securities and derivatives. System-wide
profitability improved in 2010, largely driven by lower loan provisioning, as new
impairments peaked in 2008–09.
14.
Despite challenging market conditions, major UK banks managed to raise
significant levels of term funding, both in capital markets and through private
placements (Figure 7). Refinancing needs for 2010 were fully met, and some 2011
maturities were pre-financed. Wholesale funding costs have increased moderately since mid3

See Bernheim, D., 1988, “Budget Deficits and the Balance of Trade,” Tax policy and the Economy, Vol. 2, pp.
1–31 and Bluedorn, J., and D. Leigh, 2011, “Revisiting the Twin Deficits Hypothesis: The Effect of Fiscal
Consolidation on the Current Account” (www.imf.org/external/np/seminars/eng/2010/eui/pdf/BL.pdf).

2010, though there is some variation across banks. This has led some banks to increase rates
paid on deposits, although these remain at historically low levels. Securitization has
recovered considerably from its mid-crisis lows, but it remains a less attractive source of
funding than before the crisis due to changes in the regulatory treatment of securitized assets
and increased spreads paid to investors. Covered bond issuance has increased significantly,
although it is still a relatively small part of total debt issuance.

Exit from crisis-related measures is proceeding as planned to reduce the
government’s large contingent liabilities and restore market discipline (see Appendix II
of the accompanying FSSA for a detailed update on the status of financial sector support
measures). The two large banks with government stakes have made significant progress in
restructuring their balance sheets and their funding and liquidity profiles.
16.

Although conditions in the banking sector have improved, challenges remain:



Deposits have been growing faster than loans since 2009, but the funding gap
remains large (Figure 6) and reliance on wholesale funding will remain elevated.
Banks will need to refinance a large amount of public support and private-sector debt
over the next two years. They therefore remain vulnerable to higher funding costs and
disruptions in wholesale funding markets.



Asset quality remains fragile. Nonperforming loans continued to increase in 2010,
albeit at a more moderate pace than in 2008 and 2009. The low interest rate
environment has significantly reduced debt-servicing costs and helped contain default
rates, which remain low relative to previous crises and to the U.S.4 However, bank
exposures to some EU periphery countries generated significant impairments for
select banks. Furthermore, lender forbearance may be disguising the true extent of
risks, particularly in the commercial real estate sector (CRE) where a large number of
loans are in breach of financial covenants but not yet declared in default (more than
12 percent as of end-2010). The high level of indebtedness of UK households and
some CRE companies aggravates these vulnerabilities. Various combinations of rapid
interest rates increases, a slower recovery, and further declines in property prices
could inflict significant losses on banks (see companion Selected Issues paper).



Stress tests conducted as part of the FSSA indicate that banks have reasonably
solid capital buffers but funding risks remain a key vulnerability. Solvency
concerns are limited to a low-probability confluence of adverse macroeconomic
shocks. Risks from exposures to vulnerable European sovereigns seem manageable
but potential major spillovers to the private sector in those countries and to core
European banks would be more problematic. Major UK banks have adequate liquidity
buffers under most scenarios, but remain vulnerable to sustained disruptions in
funding markets.

Higher default rates on US mortgages may partly reflect US bankruptcy laws, which make mortgage defaults
less costly to households than in the UK. These bankruptcy differences may also cause house price declines to
dampen consumption more in the UK, as households have more incentive to cut spending to avoid default.

Against this background, credit growth remains subdued. While credit conditions
have improved recently, they remain significantly tighter than before the crisis (Figure 8).


Net lending to the corporate sector has continued to fall. Credit availability has
improved for large companies, but remains restrictive for smaller businesses and for
CRE companies. The 2011Q1 credit conditions survey indicated that weaker credit
demand, possibly associated with the slow recovery, is also contributing to the
weakness in bank lending to small businesses. In contrast, lower credit demand from
large corporates reflects increased reliance on capital markets as a source of finance
for corporate investment. There is also significant differentiation in the cost of
funding across corporates: spreads on lending to small businesses have kept
increasing, while those for large borrowers are falling.



Lending to the household sector is slightly positive but still subdued. Lending
standards, albeit tighter than before the crisis, have started to loosen slightly
(Figure 8). Despite an increase in default rates on secured lending in the first quarter

of 2011, lenders report increased risk appetite towards borrowers with high loan-tovalue ratios, as competition has squeezed margins. The availability of unsecured
credit, which remained very restrictive after the crisis, has improved of late, but
spreads on credit card lending continue to increase, reflecting significantly higher
default rates than for secured lending.

III. THE CENTRAL SCENARIO AND RISKS
A. Growth and Employment
18.
Staff’s central scenario is that rebalancing occurs and financial sector health
continues to improve as described in the above sections. In this scenario, staff project
growth—led by investment and net exports—to gradually rise from 1½ percent in 2011 to
around 2½ percent over the medium term.5 This is consistent with the output gap nearly
closing by 2016, assuming


a negative output gap at end-2010 of around 2¾ percent of GDP (Box 2; Figure 9)
and



medium-term potential growth of 2 percent. This potential growth rate is consistent
with labor force growth of ½ percent and labor productivity growth of 1½ percent.
The latter is slightly below the historical average of 1¾ percent, as lingering effects of
the crisis—such as skill erosion from long-term unemployment—are expected to dent
medium-term potential growth.6

19.
The unemployment rate is expected to decline only slowly. Unemployment spiked
to 8 percent at the start of the crisis (Figure 10). It then stabilized around this level for over a
year, though it has eased slightly in recent

the recovery.

The projections in this report are those in the June 2011 World Economic Outlook Update. New data since this
update point to the likelihood that the preliminary estimate for Q2 real GDP growth will fall short of staff's
forecast for the quarter, but it is unclear how much of a possible shortfall is due to erratic factors. The next
forecast round will be published with the September 2011 World Economic Outlook.

6

This estimate for historical average labor productivity does not adjust for changes in hours worked. The
forward-looking projections based on these estimates thus implicitly assume that trends in hours worked remain
unchanged.

21
Box 2. What Does Okun’s Law Tell Us About the Output Gap?
Unemployment increased sharply during the crisis. The unemployment rate increased by
almost 3 percentage points to around 8 percent, a level not seen since the mid-1990s.
The high unemployment rate yields some insight into the size of the output gap through
Okun’s law. Okun’s law, which is empirically supported by an extensive literature, postulates
that there is a stable relationship between the unemployment rate and the output gap.1 This
relationship can be estimated empirically for the UK and then used to estimate the current output
gap, based on the distance between the current unemployment rate and the steady-state level of
unemployment (U*).2
Three different methods are used to estimate U*: The first method takes the average
unemployment rate over the last business cycle (6.8 percent), measured from the peak in output
in the second quarter of 1990 to the last peak in the first quarter of 2008. The second measure
utilizes a slow-moving filter to extract the underlying trend unemployment rate.3 This yields a U*
of 6.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010. The advantage of this approach is that it allows the
steady-state unemployment rate to change over time. The third estimate of U* uses the Office for
Budget Responsibility’s (OBR) measure of steady-state unemployment (5.25 percent).
The different measures of the steady-state
unemployment rate suggest that the output
gap in 2010 was between -2.3 percent and
-5.6 percent. As the Okun’s law equation
implies, the range of output gap estimates is
directly related to the range of estimated U*s.
As the unemployment rate has remained
persistently high, the output gap estimates
have also remained fairly constant, despite the
recovery in output during most of 2010.

See, for example, Knotek, E., 2007, “How Useful Is Okun’s Law?” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Economic
Review (Fourth Quarter), pp. 73–103.
2

The relationship is estimated using a dynamic version of Okun’s law, which relates changes in the unemployment rate to
lagged changes in output and the unemployment rate itself. See Chapter 3 of the Spring 2010 World Economic Outlook
for more details. The resulting estimate is that a 1 percentage point increase in output reduces the unemployment rate by
0.49 percentage points, based on a sample ranging from 1988Q2 to 2008Q1.
3

An HP filter is utilized for this purpose. Four candidate smoothing parameters were considered: 1600, 10000, 50000,
and 100000. To determine which smoothing parameter is the most appropriate, the resulting unemployment gap was
inserted into the following wage equation:

wt      s wt  s   U t  U t*    t
4

s 1

The smoothing parameter that yielded the largest R2, which in this case was 100000, was used.

22
Box 2. What Does Okun’s Law Tell Us About the Output Gap? (continued)
The output gap estimate based on Okun’s law
falls within the range of other estimates of the
output gap. The measure of the output gap using
the time-varying filtered estimate of U* is close to
the lower end of the estimates of the output gap
presented in the Selected Issues paper of the 2010
Article IV consultation, which have been updated.
The estimated size of the output gap for 2010,
averaged across all models, is -2.7 percent.


On the one hand, labor hoarding could imply a wider output gap. Although the
unemployment rate increased during the crisis, this increase was smaller than what would have
been expected given the size of the output decline. As a result, the fall in productivity during this
recession was larger than that experienced during previous recessions. This drop in productivity
could be evidence of unusually high labor hoarding by firms, implying that there is “hidden
underemployment” within firms that is not being captured by the unemployment rate. This
underestimate of true unemployment could result in an underestimated output gap using Okun’s
law.

On the other hand, direct surveys that ask firms how much spare capacity they have and
how easily they can hire additional workers suggest a relatively small output gap (Figure 9).

B. Inflation
20.
Inflation has been well above the 2 percent target since early 2010 (Figure 11),
but this mainly reflects transitory factors:7


As in other countries, spiking commodity prices have been an important contributor to
UK headline inflation. While headline inflation is 4¼ percent, core inflation is lower
at 2¾ percent. Recent commodity price increases will continue to put upward
pressure on inflation in the near term, including through utility price hikes in the
second half of 2011. However, with futures pointing to broadly stable commodity
prices going forward, price pressures from this source should gradually dissipate.



Unlike in many other countries, indirect tax hikes have been a key driver of UK
inflation. These include VAT rate hikes of 2½ percentage points each in January 2010
and January 2011. Staff estimates that these hikes have contributed 1¼ percentage
points to headline inflation and 1½ percentage points to core inflation. Excluding
these tax effects, core inflation is around 1¼ percent—well below the 2 percent target
and similar to rates in other advanced economies. With the last major hike in indirect
taxes occurring in April 2011, most tax effects should fall out of headline inflation by
the second half of 2012.

Part of the inflation overrun in 2010 also reflects low labor productivity growth
during the crisis. As the decline in wages was not commensurate with the drop in
productivity, unit labor costs increased sharply in 2009 and early 2010, placing
pressure on firm profits and limiting price moderation.8 Indeed, there is a statistically
significant cross-country relationship between changes in unit labor costs over

7

For more detailed analysis of recent inflation dynamics and further explanation of the estimates in this section,
see the companion Selected Issues paper.

Throughout this report, “unit labor cost” is used synonymously with “unit wage cost” for expositional ease. In
the UK, data are reported for the latter, which excludes nonwage elements of compensation.

2008–09 and the change in inflation in the subsequent year. Since mid-2010, unit
labor cost growth has been subdued as new labor hoarding ceases and productivity
growth turns positive. As labor hoarding starts to unwind going forward, this process
may accelerate, helping to boost productivity and placing downward pressure on unit
labor costs and inflation. However, it is unclear how large such effects will be.

Change in inflation rate between 2009 and 2010

Another major contributor to inflation during 2009–10 was the delayed pass-through
from the large exchange rate depreciation in 2008. However, its contribution is
estimated to have tapered off by end-2010.

21.
Inflation is likely to approach 5 percent during 2011, but then return near the
2 percent target around end-2012. Inflation is likely to continue rising in the short run as
the impulse from past commodity price increases continues to play out. Disinflation should
then occur as the transitory factors noted above dissipate and as significant spare capacity
keeps underlying inflation in check. Leading indicators support this outlook:


growth rates of credit, broad money, and
unit labor costs are all low;



there is little evidence of brewing asset
price bubbles (house prices are slightly
falling);



9

medium-term inflation expectations remain
at pre-crisis levels—when the inflation
target was consistently met—and thus are
consistent with meeting the target;9 and

C. Risks

22.
Risks around the central scenario are significant. The recent large divergence
between GDP growth and other indicators creates substantial uncertainty about the near-term
direction of the economy. In addition, there are a number of risks that, if they materialize,
could be difficult to offset and thus result in a rapid change in the macroeconomic outlook
and policy environment. Key risks include the following:

the UK has further large trade and financial links to countries, such as France and
Germany, that could be significantly affected by turmoil in the euro-area periphery.

As noted earlier, UK banks’ direct exposures to vulnerable euro-area sovereigns appear
manageable in isolation. However, effects on the UK economy would be magnified if
heightened turmoil in the euro-area periphery leads to stresses in core European banks or

combines with disruptions in wholesale funding markets. Such a combination of forces could
set off an adverse and self-reinforcing cycle of higher bank losses and funding costs, tighter
credit, lower consumer confidence and exports, and falling real estate prices, resulting in a
substantial contractionary shock. However, the UK may also benefit from other effects such
as lower commodity prices. On balance, it is unclear how large the net spillover would be.
Mitigating policies such as liquidity and capital support facilities may also reduce its impact.
Uncertain fiscal headwinds and commodity prices: Although fiscal consolidation headwinds
are estimated using standard multipliers, their magnitude is uncertain. Similarly, volatile
commodity import prices pose risks to both growth and inflation. Indeed, unexpected spikes
in commodity prices have been a significant factor behind revisions to staff’s 2011 inflation
and growth forecasts since the 2010 Article IV consultation.
House prices: Another key risk is that house prices may differ from central scenario
assumptions, with large effects on residential investment and consumption (via wealth
effects). These risks exist in both directions and reflect uncertainty regarding both the path of
real interest rates and the degree to which price rises over the last decade reflect structural
versus cyclical factors.
Inflation surprises: Continued upside inflation surprises could eventually force rapid
monetary tightening to re-anchor inflation expectations, with associated adverse effects on
household and corporate balance sheets, consumption, and investment. A key factor behind
such inflation risks is the significant uncertainty over the size of the output gap (Box 2).
Adverse demand shocks (from risks noted above) could also produce downside inflation
surprises, raising short-term real rates and again tightening monetary conditions, unless
further asset purchases (quantitative easing) are able to provide an offset.

similar to staff’s central scenario. However, they
project slightly higher growth rates both in 2011 and 2012, reflecting both a higher estimated
output gap now and higher projected potential growth. The BoE’s latest inflation projections
are broadly similar to those of staff. The authorities see similar risks to the central scenario
and put particular emphasis on elevated sovereign and banking risks in parts of the euro area.

31
IV. MACROECONOMIC POLICIES IN THE CENTRAL SCENARIO
A. The Policy Mix
24.
The multiple challenges of restoring full employment, returning inflation to
target, and repairing public and private balance sheets requires close attention to the
policy mix. The overall tightness of macroeconomic policy should be calibrated to balance
upside risks to inflation against downside risks to growth. Although both risks are currently
substantial, they are broadly offsetting, implying that the overall tightness of policy remains
appropriate for now. Within this overall degree of tightness, there is the question of the
appropriate mix between monetary and fiscal policy. On this, the case for relatively tight
fiscal and relatively loose monetary policy is strong: in addition to restoring fiscal
sustainability, such a mix will help keep real interest rates low and sterling competitive. This
economic environment will further assist public and private balance sheet repair while
promoting expansion of investment and net exports. This is necessary if robust output and
employment growth are to be achieved at the same time that private and public consumption
are eased to more sustainable levels.
B. The Monetary Policy Decision
25.
The current monetary stance remains appropriate for now. The BoE has
maintained a Bank Rate of 0.5 percent and bond purchases of £200 billion since early 2010.
This highly accommodative stance is appropriate given the central scenario projection that
inflation will return to target within a reasonable timeframe, the uncertainty regarding the
strength of recovery, and the need to offset significant disinflationary impulses from fiscal
policy.
26.
If growth resumes as expected in the coming quarters, the case for beginning to
withdraw some monetary stimulus will slowly increase. Markets are currently pricing in at
least a 50 percent probability of a first rate hike by February 2012 and a second rate hike by
August 2012. In the central scenario, the pace at which monetary stimulus is withdrawn—
which could occur through a combination of policy rate hikes and asset sales—should indeed
be gradual given the extended period of fiscal contraction and the potentially large effects of
higher interest rates on growth, which if too weak could yield persistent inflation undershoots
in the medium term. In particular, growth remains vulnerable to a steep drop in house prices
(as discussed earlier), which in turn are highly sensitive to short-term interest rates—
variable-rate mortgages account for 70 percent of the market. With household debt levels still
elevated by historical standards (see companion Selected Issues paper), rapid interest rate
hikes could also cut directly into households’ disposable income (and therefore
consumption), though this effect would be partially mitigated by households’ higher interest
income.

32
27.
The medium-term “neutral rate” consistent with stable inflation and full
employment may be somewhat lower than before the crisis. Supporting this view are the
following factors:



As described in Section II.A, the central
scenario relies on substantial rebalancing
toward private and external demand. It is
not clear that the required rebalancing will
occur in the absence of strong price signals.
In particular, an extended period of low real
interest rates may be necessary to prompt
sufficiently high private consumption,
private investment, and net exports.



1/ Real rate on zero-coupon bonds.
Empirically, expected short-term real
rates—as embedded in medium-term real rates on inflation-indexed bonds—have
fallen significantly relative to pre-crisis levels.



Theoretically, it is likely that the financial crisis has sharply shifted down the demand
for investment and consumption at any given interest rate, reducing the equilibrium
interest rate consistent with full employment.

This view further supports a gradual tightening, given the more limited amount of total
adjustment required by the tightening cycle.
28.
Nonetheless, leading indicators should be monitored closely. Monetary tightening
will need to accelerate if leading inflation indicators—especially unit labor costs and
inflation expectations—turn more worrisome.
Authorities’ views
29.
The authorities broadly agree with staff’s assessment regarding the stance of
monetary policy in the central scenario. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has so far
judged that monetary policy needs to remain accommodative in order to meet the inflation
target in the medium term. But there are differences in view on the Committee on the precise
setting necessary to achieve this. The majority of MPC members view the current policy
stance as appropriate given the temporary nature of recent inflation outturns, subdued wage
growth, and contained inflation expectations. The minority of members favouring a slightly
less accommodative policy place more weight on the risks that an extended period of high
headline inflation could in future feed into higher inflation expectations and that external
price pressures may continue to raise domestic inflation. A third view is that inflation
expectations remain well anchored and deflationary pressures will dominate in the medium
term, so that further asset purchases are required.

C. Fiscal Consolidation Plans

The March 2011 budget maintains the government’s ambitious medium-term
fiscal consolidation plan (Figure 13).10 In June 2010, the new government set itself a “fiscal

remain significant in 2011.
32.
The path of fiscal consolidation is appropriate in the central scenario, but is not
without risks. Fiscal consolidation is essential to stabilize debt and thereby avoid possible
abrupt adjustment later forced by market pressure. As discussed in Section IV.A, fiscal
consolidation is also integral to the broader macroeconomic strategy of post-crisis repair.
Nonetheless, consolidation plans face the risk that private domestic demand and net exports
may not be vibrant enough to pick up the slack from public sector deleveraging. If such risks
materialize, macroeconomic policies may need to adjust (Section V).
33.
The medium-term consolidation plan is mainly expenditure-based. Spending cuts
are spread fairly evenly across the 5-year horizon due to the difficulty of cutting spending
quickly. In contrast, the main tax measures—including the January 2011 VAT hike, higher
capital gains taxes, and a new bank levy on wholesale liabilities—have already come into

constant in real terms, and foreign aid will
receive a real increase of 30 percent. The overall focus on expenditure reduction appears
appropriate, as cyclically adjusted spending rose by 9 percent of GDP over the last decade.

36
International evidence also suggests that expenditure-based consolidations are associated
with longer-lasting budgetary improvements.11
34.
Despite flexibility built into the consolidation plans, there are risks to achieving
the mandate. The plan to meet the fiscal mandate one year early provides a buffer against
implementation risks and forecast errors. The OBR’s judgment is that there is a 70 percent
probability that the cyclically adjusted current budget will be in balance in five years’ time.
Nonetheless, risks remain even with this built-in flexibility. One important risk relates to the
size of the output gap: the March 2011 budget

Furthermore, consolidation has so far relied heavily
on tax hikes and the phase-out of stimulus. As consolidation becomes more reliant on
structural spending cuts going forward, implementation challenges may rise. Meeting these
challenges will require careful management to ensure delivery of the targeted consolidation
while shielding the poor. The detailed multi-year spending plans laid out in the October 2010
Spending Review should assist in this regard.
35.
Building on progress already made, further structural reforms could help
address remaining longer-term fiscal imbalances and support medium-term growth.
Important planned or potential reforms include the following:

Accelerating increases in the state pension age and indexing it to longevity. The
retirement age for state pensions (the universal scheme for both private and public
employees) is now 60 for women and 65 for men. The government has already
proposed legislation to equalize the pension age at 65 by 2018 (instead of by 2020 as
under current law) and to raise the pension age to 66 by 2020 (instead of 2028 as
under current law). However, the currently legislated hikes to age 67 (by 2036) and to
age 68 (by 2046) could also be accelerated, with indexation to longevity thereafter.
This would reduce longer-term fiscal imbalances due to ageing and could boost
medium-to-long-run growth by encouraging longer working lives.
See, for example, staff’s 2010 Selected Issues paper on the UK.

37


Reforming public-service pensions. Studies suggest that the two-year wage freeze
will close part of the gap between average public-service wages and private-sector
wages for comparable employees. However, public-service pensions remain
significantly more generous than those in the private sector. A government-appointed
commission (the Independent Public Service Pensions Commission) thus recently
recommended a number of reforms to improve the structure of public-service
pensions and reduce their cost. Any near-term savings from such reforms (beyond
those already budgeted) could fund growth and employment-enhancing measures
(e.g., fewer cuts in infrastructure spending), thereby making adjustment more “growth
friendly.”



Easing tight planning restrictions. As a supplement to the 2011 budget, the
government released The Plan for Growth—a number of measures aimed at boosting
potential output. Many of the individual measures are modest in scale, but one area
that could have important effects are measures to ease the UK’s tight planning
restrictions, which hinder new real estate developments. If successful, these
measures—which include, for example, a 12-month guarantee for processing
planning applications—could provide a fillip to construction and spur productivityenhancing investment.12 However, it remains to be seen if the various initiatives will
succeed in substantially easing restrictions, which are to a significant degree
controlled by local governments.

36.
Institutional reforms adopted by the government should assist these objectives.
In particular, the government recently passed legislation to put the independent OBR on a
permanent footing. This new institution should help strengthen the credibility of fiscal
analysis and forecasts, including with the publication of its first fiscal sustainability report
(focusing on longer-run fiscal challenges) in July 2011.
Authorities’ views
37.
The authorities stressed that strong fiscal consolidation remains the linchpin of
their economic strategy and were confident about its success. The Government is fully
committed to implementing the plans set out in the budget and the spending review. They
noted that consolidation plans had provided stimulus by allowing monetary policy to remain
loose, by keeping UK sovereign borrowing costs low, and by supporting business
confidence. They welcomed staff’s support for structural reforms to ease planning
restrictions and reform public-service pensions, and they saw merit in making further reforms

12

Note that a boost to real estate supply from looser planning restrictions is likely positive or neutral for shortrun growth, whereas as an adverse shock to real estate demand from higher interest rates is likely negative for
growth, even though both shocks may result in lower house prices.

to the state pension age. However, they did not consider it advisable to revisit the
composition of expenditure plans, which they believe have allowed key public services and
growth-enabling public spending to be protected while increasing fairness and opportunities
for social mobility. On fiscal institutions, they viewed the creation of the OBR as a major
advance in addressing deficiencies in the previous institutional framework, improving the
credibility and independence of economic and fiscal forecasts.
V. MACROECONOMIC POLICIES IN RISK SCENARIOS
38.
Policies will need to react if major risks materialize or appear imminent. On the
fiscal side, automatic stabilizers should operate freely, as allowed by the fiscal mandate.
Additional policy responses will depend on the nature of the shock. For example:


If growth and inflationary pressures are stronger than expected, monetary tightening
will need to accelerate. Any revenue windfalls should be saved in this case, even if
larger than implied by automatic stabilizers.



If the economy appears likely to experience a prolonged period of weak growth and
high unemployment—and if inflationary pressures consequently ease—it will be
important to ensure that the slowdown does not become entrenched due to capital
scrapping and cyclical unemployment becoming structural. If this appears to be in
prospect, then some combination of the following would need to be considered: (i)
supplementing the current low monetary policy rate with expanded asset purchases by
the BoE and (ii) temporary tax cuts. Tax cuts have the advantage of being faster to
implement and more credibly temporary than expenditure shifts. To increase their
multipliers, tax cuts should be targeted to low-income households, investment (e.g.,
temporary investment tax credits, which would also facilitate rebalancing toward
investment), or job creation (e.g., temporary cuts in employer payroll taxes to reduce
employment costs). Temporary fiscal stimulus should be accompanied by deeper
long-run entitlement reform (as discussed in Section IV.C) to safeguard fiscal
sustainability and market confidence.



In the event of both persistent weak growth and high inflation, the appropriate
response depends on the source of this condition: if it is due to further commodity
price volatility, policies need not respond unless there is clear evidence of secondround effects (e.g., higher import prices feeding into higher wage growth). In the
more difficult case in which weak growth and high inflation result from a much
narrower-than-estimated output gap (which would be indicated by rapid growth of
unit labor costs), policies will have little choice but to tighten to re-anchor
inflationary expectations. A narrower output gap would also imply a higher-thancurrently-estimated structural deficit and therefore would require further fiscal
tightening over the medium term.

39
Authorities’ views
39.
The authorities agreed with the relevance of the risk scenarios outlined by staff
and are being watchful, though they noted that the economy was still some distance
from these scenarios. They stressed that the overriding priority was to successfully
implement the fiscal consolidation plans, as ensuring confidence in debt sustainability is a
prerequisite for recovery in any scenario. In this regard, any significant adjustments to the
expenditure plans would be unhelpful, as they would cast doubt on the credibility of the
overall plan. The effectiveness of any spending stimulus would also be hampered by
implementation lags. Monetary policy would be the first port of call, as it is better placed to
fine-tune macroeconomic conditions. They noted that in some scenarios fiscal stimulus could
also be counterproductive to growth if heightened sovereign risk concerns increase the
sensitivity of borrowing costs to fiscal deficits. Moreover, the authorities highlighted that
their consolidation plans already build in flexibility, including through setting plans to the
meet the mandate one year early, with headroom against the mandate in 2015-16, and by
specifying the target in cyclically adjusted terms. Consistent with this, they agreed that
automatic stabilizers provide an important safeguard against risks.

regard to funding and asset quality, as detailed in the accompanying FSSA. The authorities
are thus taking wide-ranging reforms to strengthen regulatory and supervisory oversight,
including in the context of the international reform agenda under Basel III. Further reforms
are needed, as discussed in detail in the FSSA and summarized in Box 3. Indeed, the UK’s
large financial sector relative to the economy and the resulting fiscal and macro-stability
risks put a premium on ambitious financial sector reform. Furthermore, given the size,
complexity, and interconnectedness of the UK financial system, shocks have the potential to
be widely amplified across the global economy, as seen during the crisis and as highlighted
in the accompanying Spillover Report. Ensuring the stability of the UK financial system is
therefore critical to promoting global financial stability.

40
Box 3. FSSA: Main Recommendations
This box summarizes the recommendations of the FSSA update. These recommendations aim to enhance
the robustness of financial sector oversight. The authorities recognize the importance of these issues and are
carefully considering how to take these recommendations forward.
Overall financial sector oversight
 Revise the legal framework to clarify mandates and include a specific financial stability mandate
for the prudential authorities.
 Amend legislation to allow for regulatory power over holding companies of regulated entities.
 Enhance resources for supervision of banks, insurers, and securities firms based on the agreed-upon
supervisory operating model and the new macroprudential overlay.
 Establish a forum for ensuring good governance and coordination among organizations in the new
regulatory structure.
 Enforce public disclosure by banks, insurers, and securities firms, including prudential returns, as
appropriate.
 Amend risk-based assessment methodologies to ensure adequate assessment of anti-money
laundering and combating the financing of terrorism risk.
Banking sector oversight
 Enhance supervision by conducting detailed reviews of credit and market risk assessment by banks,
conducting verification and selected model replication reviews on a proactive basis, better
integrating specialist work into the supervision programs, and enhancing peer analysis.
 Adopt a proactive intervention framework through triggers for contacts and coordination actions
with other authorities and amend legislation as needed.
 Develop a comprehensive plan to enhance prudential reporting and conduct a review to deliver a
more systematic approach to data quality.
Insurance sector oversight
 Extend the new intrusive risk-based approach to supervision to a wider range of insurers.
 Increase the frequency and number of randomly conducted “transaction examinations.”
Securities markets oversight
 Clarify in legislation that the remit of the conduct authority includes market integrity and
transparency to ensure adequate emphasis on issues other than consumer protection.
 Increase intensity of supervision with greater use of “bottom-up” analysis of firm operations using
on-site examinations to supplement the “top-down” risk analysis.
.
Payments and securities systems oversight
 Ensure that sufficient and reliable funding options are in place for central counterparties (CCPs),
including committed credit lines subject only to presentment.
 Develop contingency plans to deal with a potential failure of a CCP.
 Offer central bank settlement to CCPs that have been classified as systemic institutions.
 Establish close monitoring of concentration of banks’ payments and settlements activities.
 Undertake a unified assessment of the real time gross settlement (RTGS) infrastructure, including
an assessment of the finality of transactions.
Crisis management
 Establish appropriate resolution tools and a framework for potentially systemically important nonbank firms that are not covered by the Special Resolution Regime.

41
B. Strengthening Financial System Soundness
41.

Continued build up of capital and liquidity buffers is essential.



Currently, all major banks have core tier 1 ratios over 10 percent and must
demonstrate ratios of at least 4 percent under stressed conditions. Given heightened
risks, capital buffers should continue to be built up ahead of Basel III requirements,
and approval of dividend and variable remuneration should continue to be linked to
the outcome of stress tests.



Similarly, the authorities implemented a new liquidity regime in 2010, ahead of the
phase-in schedule agreed internationally. Liquidity requirements—currently more
stringent than in other major jurisdictions—are appropriate given the specific
vulnerabilities of the UK financial system but, given spillover effects, should be
accompanied by home-host coordination to help address cross-border liquidity needs
in times of stress.

42.
The authorities have strengthened the supervisory framework; plans for further
enhancements are welcome and should be a top priority. The crisis revealed serious
weaknesses in supervision. Some of these shortcomings have since been addressed by the
more proactive and intrusive approach to supervision adopted by the Financial Services
Authority (FSA). Plans to further step up supervisory efforts are necessary and welcome,
including ongoing work to:


Strengthen the FSA’s assessment of banks’ processes, including loan classification,
impairment determination, and valuation practices. Achieving this requires (i) more
intensive on-site review work involving more specialist expertise and (ii) greater
engagement of FSA senior management in the supervision of individual banks.



Introduce a proactive intervention framework. It is important that framework
legislation include explicit support for early intervention by the supervisor in dealing
with prudential problems.



Provide the regulatory authority with oversight powers at the holding company
level. This will improve consolidated supervision.



Enhance data reporting standards. The UK lags behind many other countries in
standards for the public disclosure of bank and insurance sector data. Regular and
comparable data on an institution basis should be published, including nonconfidential data from prudential returns.

42
C. Strengthening the Domestic Oversight Framework
43.
The transition to the new institutional framework for regulation and supervision
needs to be managed carefully to mitigate operational risks. The UK plans to move to a
“triple peak” model, with one organization under the BoE responsible for microprudential
regulation and supervision—the Prudential Regulatory Authority—and a separate
organization responsible for conduct of business and market regulation—the Financial
Conduct Authority. The creation of a macroprudential overlay through a Financial Policy
Committee (FPC) under the BoE is also in train. Implementing these new arrangements while
at the same time stepping up supervision will require careful management. A clear division
of responsibilities and close cooperation and information-sharing between all supervisory
agencies and the government will be crucial to make the new arrangements work effectively.
44.
The establishment of the FPC is an important step in developing mechanisms to
mitigate systemic risk. Before the crisis, insufficient attention was given to the analysis and
monitoring of system-wide rather than firm-specific risks. The FPC will fill this gap. An
interim FPC was created in February 2011 to carry out preparatory work, including analysis
of potential macroprudential tools, in advance of the creation of the permanent FPC by end2012. For the FPC to be credible, it will be important to set realistic expectations of what
macroprudential regulation can achieve, especially in its early stages of implementation.
45.
The design of an effective macroprudential toolkit and the development of an
operational framework may prove challenging, as no best practices have yet emerged. A
range of macroprudential tools should be considered given uncertainties regarding their
effects and the nature of future risks. The choice of instruments at the FPC’s disposal should
be guided by the degree to which they (i) are effective in mitigating the amplitude of
economic cycles and creating buffers to be used in periods of stress; (ii) minimize scope for
regulatory arbitrage and cross-border spillovers; and (iii) minimize efficiency costs. A partial
list of tools that may fit these criteria include countercyclical variation of the following
instruments: the countercyclical capital buffer under Basel III, capital risk weights on banks’
exposures to specific asset classes, liquidity requirements, limits on loan-to-value and debtto-income ratios, and the bank levy on wholesale funding. Application of jurisdictional
reciprocity would make many of these tools more effective by reducing arbitrage
possibilities.
D. Strengthening the Capacity to Deal with Systemically Important Financial
Institutions (SIFIs)
46.
Progress has been made in addressing the too-important-to-fail problem, but
more needs to be done. The authorities have strengthened regulatory ratios, established
more intensive and proactive supervision commensurate with the complexity and risk of each
institution, and introduced a bank levy on wholesale funding. To further address the systemic
risks posed by SIFIs, policies should aim at reducing the probability of failure (prevention)

43
and reducing the impact of failure when they occur (resolution). In regard to the latter, ringfencing of retail operations and establishment of depositor preference, as proposed by the
Independent Commission on Banking (ICB), will improve resolvability of the retail entity.
However, ring-fencing must be weighed against the costs of such an approach and does not
necessarily improve resolvability of the whole entity unless complemented by measures that
increase loss absorption capacity and burden-sharing with the private sector (e.g. capital and
liquidity surcharges, contingent capital, and debt subject to bail-in), recovery and resolution
plans, and cross-border resolution arrangements. International collaboration will be critical
for progress in these areas, and the UK authorities should continue exercising leadership on
these matters. Ring-fencing should also not create complacency toward risks taken by
investment banks or reduce oversight of them, as these activities can also be systemic.
47.
The government could also consider tax measures to mitigate systemic risks
posed by SIFIs. The corporate tax creates a bias against equity finance and promotes
excessive leverage because interest on debt is tax-deductible while equity finance is not. This
bias could be reduced by introducing an Allowance for Corporate Equity (ACE)—an explicit
deduction for the cost of equity finance, as in Belgium and as proposed by the Mirrlees
Review and the IMF Staff Discussion Note Tax Biases to Debt Finance: Assessing the
Problem, Finding Solutions. Given the fiscal cost associated with applying an ACE to all
corporates, the government could explore the feasibility of applying an ACE initially only to
banks—for whom excessive leverage has the highest social costs—with an offsetting hike in
the bank levy. This could significantly improve incentives for deleveraging without
disadvantaging the UK banking sector on average, as it could be designed to be revenueneutral for the sector as a whole. However, potential intra-group and cross-border taxation
issues under such a reform would need to be studied carefully.
48.
Central counterparties (CCPs) should be subject to robust standards to avoid
becoming too-important-to-fail. CCPs enhance transparency and risk management in
bilateral clearing, but concentrate counterparty risk. The failure of a major CCP could affect
not only the functioning of the domestic financial market, but also have a cross-border
dimension due to the global nature of UK financial markets. Therefore, the authorities should
ensure:


robust prudential and risk management standards to protect the integrity of the
markets and mitigate adverse spillovers across countries, including ensuring that
CCPs have sufficient liquidity; and



coordinated contingency plans to deal with the failure of a CCP before the crisis
occurs.

Such efforts would be bolstered by international coordination of liquidity, capital, risk
management, and unwinding regulations for CCPs.

44
E. The International Dimension
49.
The stability of the UK financial sector critically depends on a stronger
international framework for oversight of cross-border financial institutions. The UK is
both home and host to large domestic and international financial institutions. International
foreign bank subsidiaries and branches hold half of UK banking assets, but the UK has very
limited oversight powers over branches of foreign banks due to European Economic Area
passporting rules. Cooperation with international partners—especially European institutions,
the US, and Switzerland (the latter two being particularly important in coordinating oversight
of investment banks)—and sharing of supervisory information among home and host country
authorities is therefore essential. Progress on cross-border resolution will also require
international cooperation and high-level political commitment. In the absence of
coordination, regulatory arbitrage could undermine the UK’s efforts and UK policies could
undermine other countries’ efforts.
50.
The UK authorities should continue to work toward an ambitious international
package of regulatory reform and rigorous implementation of this package in the EU.
Staff strongly support the authorities’ efforts to advocate for European legislation under the
EU Capital Requirements Directive (CRD4) that enable the establishment of strong standards
that (i) exceed Basel III minima, including by setting ambitiously high capital requirements
together with significantly topped-up capital demands on SIFIs, and (ii) allow flexibility for
national authorities to use a range of macroprudential tools, including adjusting capital and
liquidity requirements or varying risk weights, to address emerging financial and systemic
risks. Collaboration with other macroprudential bodies will be important to ensure home-host
coordination and reciprocity where appropriate.
51.
The UK authorities are uniquely placed to contribute to the surveillance of
global systemic risks. Given the central role of the UK in the global financial system, the
authorities have informational advantages in assessing emerging global risks. Collaboration
and information sharing between the FPC and other macroprudential bodies could help
mitigate these risks. To this end, the FPC should also consider the outward spillovers of its
policy decisions.
Authorities’ views
52.
There was broad agreement on the domestic reform agenda. The authorities
indicated continued progress on the wide range of initiatives to strengthen the regulatory and
supervisory framework and are carefully considering how best to take forward the FSSA
recommendations. They concurred with the view that this ambitious reform agenda entails
risks and challenges, as the financial sector is still recovering and internationally agreed
standards will be implemented simultaneously. They are cognizant of the impact of
regulatory uncertainty on the banking system and intend to address this after the final report
of the ICB is published in September 2011.

45
53.
The authorities emphasized the need to achieve an ambitious regulatory
framework at the global and EU level. They expressed serious concern about potential
proposals in relation to CRD4. In particular, they emphasized the need to fully implement the
internationally agreed Basel III framework in detail, as G20 leaders have agreed. They
stressed the importance of having national discretion to set higher standards than the
minimum levels of Basel III in specific circumstances and to operate countercyclical
macroprudential policy in order to protect financial stability. They will continue to work with
international partners on outstanding issues, including cross-border resolution, and welcomed
the IMF’s efforts to strengthen the multilateral dialogue, including through spillover reports.
VII. STAFF APPRAISAL
54.
Aided by the implementation of a wide-ranging policy program, the post-crisis
repair of the UK economy continues. Over the last year, the government has cut the
structural fiscal deficit, banks have bolstered their balance sheets, and businesses have
expanded employment. The government has also created new institutions to address
weaknesses in the policymaking framework revealed by the crisis. These include a new FPC
to oversee macroprudential policy and an independent OBR that should strengthen the
credibility of fiscal analysis and forecasts. These developments and reforms move in the right
direction, though much remains to be done on the path to recovery.
55.
Growth and inflation have been worse-than-expected in recent quarters, but are
projected to improve over time. One factor behind recent weak growth is the spike in
commodity prices, which dented consumer confidence. Going forward, this drag on growth is
expected to lessen and growth is expected to gradually resume, as low interest rates,
corporates’ strong cash positions, and global growth support expansion led by net exports
and investment. However, the pace of recovery will be moderate, as headwinds from fiscal
consolidation, a soft housing market, and the ongoing process of household and bank balance
sheet repair continue to weigh on growth. Inflation is expected to return near the 2 percent
target by end-2012, as transitory factors that have boosted headline inflation dissipate and as
significant spare capacity keeps underlying inflation in check.
56.
In this central scenario, the current settings of fiscal and monetary policy remain
appropriate. The fiscal consolidation plan aims to stabilize government debt within a few
years, thereby preserving confidence in debt sustainability. Although consolidation will
create headwinds for short-term growth, it will also assist disinflation and can thus be
countered by looser monetary policy than otherwise. In this context, the current
accommodative monetary stance is appropriate, given the projection that inflation will return
to target in a reasonable timeframe and the uncertainty regarding the strength of the recovery.
57.
Such a policy mix will support economic rebalancing to a more sustainable
equilibrium. Tight fiscal and accommodative monetary policy will help keep real interest
rates low and sterling competitive. This economic environment will assist public and private

46
balance sheet repair while promoting expansion of investment and net exports. This is
necessary if robust output and employment growth are to be achieved at the same time that
private and public consumption are eased to more sustainable levels.
58.
If growth resumes as expected in the coming quarters, the case for reducing the
degree of monetary accommodation will slowly increase. In the central scenario, the pace
at which monetary stimulus is withdrawn should be measured, given the extended period of
fiscal contraction and the high sensitivity of house prices (and hence consumption and
residential investment) to short-term interest rates. Furthermore, the real interest rate
consistent with stable inflation and full employment may remain low for some time, as it is
likely that the financial crisis has shifted down the demand for investment and consumption
at any given interest rate.
59.
Fiscal consolidation should be supported by further structural reforms to
address longer-term fiscal imbalances and bolster medium-term growth. Further
accelerating increases in the state pension age and indexing it to longevity would reduce
longer-term fiscal imbalances and could raise labor supply by encouraging longer working
lives. Reform of public-service pensions, along the lines recommended by the Independent
Public Service Pensions Commission, would help improve their structure and better align
average public-service compensation with private-sector equivalents. Efforts to ease tight
planning restrictions are also welcome, as they could spur construction and productivityenhancing development.
60.
The central scenario is nonetheless subject to large risks and policy flexibility
will be essential to respond to shocks. Key risks arise from uncertainties surrounding
commodity prices, euro-area sovereign turmoil, the housing market, and the size of the
output gap and fiscal multipliers. On the upside, if growth and inflationary pressures are
stronger than expected, monetary tightening should accelerate and all fiscal windfalls should
be saved. Conversely, if the economy appears likely to experience prolonged weak growth
and lower inflation, fiscal automatic stabilizers should operate freely and monetary policy
should be kept loose for an extended period. To prevent a downturn from becoming
entrenched, additional stimulus may be required from BoE asset purchases and temporary
targeted tax cuts, combined with deeper long-run entitlement reform to safeguard fiscal
sustainability and market confidence. In the event further commodity price volatility
temporarily extends the period of weak growth and high inflation, policies need not respond.
However, if weak growth and high inflation reflect a much narrower-than-estimated output
gap (as indicated by rapid growth of unit labor costs), policies will have to tighten to reanchor inflationary expectations.
61.
UK financial sector stability is a global public good, requiring the highest quality
regulation and supervision. The UK’s stringent capital and liquidity regulations—including
the pressure from supervisors to use strong earnings to build up capital ahead of official
requirements and linking the approval of dividends and variable remuneration to the outcome

47
of FSA stress tests—are thus proper and necessary. To be effective, regulatory requirements
should be accompanied by more intrusive supervision, and FSA plans to make improvements
in this regard are welcome. To support this work, forthcoming framework legislation should
also provide (i) explicit support for early intervention by the supervisor in dealing with
prudential problems and (ii) regulatory enforcement powers at the holding company level to
enhance consolidated supervision.
62.
The active use of macroprudential tools, under the purview of the FPC, should
help reduce systemic risk going forward. The FPC should focus on tools that are most
effective against the cycle and minimize efficiency costs and scope for regulatory arbitrage.
For the FPC to be credible, it will be important to set realistic expectations of what
macroprudential regulation can achieve, especially in its early stages of implementation.
63.
Progress has been made in addressing the too-important-to-fail problem, but
more needs to be done. Further tax reforms, such as a revenue-neutral allowance for
corporate equity, could be considered to help reduce incentives for excessive leverage. Given
the systemic importance of CCPs, the authorities should subject them to robust risk
management standards and establish contingency plans to deal with possible failures. Ringfencing of retail operations and establishment of depositor preference, as proposed by the
ICB, will improve resolvability of the retail entity. However, ring-fencing must be weighed
against the costs of such an approach and does not necessarily improve resolvability of the
whole entity unless complemented by comprehensive measures—including improved loss
absorption capacity, recovery and resolution plans, and cross-border resolution
arrangements—on which international coordination is critical.
64.
Indeed, strong cooperation with and from international partners is essential to
securing financial stability. It will be important that European legislation under CRD4
enables the establishment of strong standards that exceed Basel III minima and allows broad
flexibility for national authorities to introduce countercyclical macroprudential tools.
Collaboration between the FPC and other macroprudential bodies will be important to ensure
home-host coordination (including to address cross-border liquidity needs in times of stress),
reciprocity where appropriate, and information sharing. Given the UK’s global importance,
the FPC should also consider the outward spillovers of its policy decisions.
65.
The UK lags behind many other countries in standards for the public disclosure
of bank and insurance sector data. Work underway to allow publication of regular and
comparable data on an institution basis is therefore welcome.
66.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with the United
Kingdom be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Annex: Public Sector Debt Sustainability
General government gross debt is projected to increase from a trough of 42 percent of
GDP in FY06/07 to a peak of about 85 percent of GDP in FY13/14 under the
government’s planned consolidation (Table A1). The debt ratio would come down to about
78 percent of GDP by FY16/17. The baseline scenario for this debt sustainability analysis
builds on staff’s central scenario and hence takes into account announced policies. The
general government primary deficit is expected to have peaked in FY09/10 at 9¼ percent of
GDP and reach a surplus of 2 percent of GDP by FY16/17. As a result, the debt ratio would
be on a downward path from FY14/15. Gross financing needs in the near term are high, but
are expected to ease slightly to about 15 percent of GDP in FY11/12 after peaking at
16¾ percent of GDP in FY10/11.
Alternative scenarios and bound tests highlight the uncertainties surrounding the
projected debt path (Figure A1). Different policy paths or growth scenarios would
significantly affect debt outcomes:


Debt would increase rapidly in the absence of fiscal consolidation. In a scenario
with a constant primary balance (in percent of GDP) over FY11/12-16/17, debt would
increase to 101 percent of GDP by FY16/17 and be on a firm upward path. The
impact of unchanged policies would be even higher than this estimate if concerns
about sovereign debt dynamics lead to higher interest rates.



If medium-term growth rates are persistently lower than anticipated, stabilizing
the debt ratio would require further adjustment. Assuming expenditure plans
remain unchanged, the debt-to-GDP ratio could reach 89 percent of GDP by FY16/17
should growth be 1.1 percentage points (½ a standard deviation) lower each year than
in the central scenario.

1/ Data are for general government and on a fiscal year basis (which starts in April).
2/ Derived as [(r - (1+g - g + (1+r]/(1+g++g)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate;  = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;  = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and  = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as (1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

UNITED KINGDOM
Staff Report for the 2011 Article IV Consultation—Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Ajai Chopra and Tamim Bayoumi
July 25, 2011
This supplement provides an update on key developments that occurred after the staff report
was finalized. These developments do not affect the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) published its first Fiscal
Sustainability Report (FSR) on July 13. The report makes long-term fiscal projections
assuming implementation of the government’s consolidation plan through FY15/16 and
unchanged policies thereafter.

120


In this central scenario, the OBR projects
that population aging and associated
increases in pension and healthcare
spending will slowly reduce the primary
balance and increase public sector net debt
to 107 percent of GDP by FY60/61.

instead annual healthcare spending growth is 1 percentage point faster (historically,
healthcare spending per elderly has been 1–2 percentage points faster than per capita
GDP growth), the FSR projects that the primary deficit would be more than 5 percent
of GDP higher than in the central scenario by FY60/61.



These projections highlight that substantial fiscal consolidation after FY15/16 will be
necessary to ensure fiscal sustainability over the long run. However, the UK is not
unique in this regard—its long-run fiscal challenge from population aging is similar
to that of many European economies.1 The large planned fiscal consolidation over the

1

See Sustainability Report 2009 (European Commission, 2009).

2
next 5 years also greatly reduces the total amount of consolidation required in the
long run.
At the same time as the FSR, the Treasury released Whole of Government Accounts for
FY09/10, which for the first time presented the public-sector financial position on the basis
of commercial accounting standards, including future liabilities arising from public-service
pensions. This release does not fundamentally affect IMF staff’s view of the fiscal situation,
but it is a step forward for fiscal transparency.
2.
All four UK banks included in the European Banking Authority (EBA) stress
tests passed. The stress test results show that each of the four banks—Lloyds Banking Group
(LBG), Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), and HSBC—would maintain core tier 1
ratios of at least 5 percent (the minimum level set by the EBA) under a stressed scenario of
low GDP growth over two years, falling property prices, rising unemployment, and moderate
haircuts on trading book holdings of peripheral European sovereign bonds.2 The results are
broadly in line with those of the FSAP stress tests for these banks.3

The EBA adverse scenario of a slight contraction in the first year and small positive growth in the second is
roughly equivalent to the mild adverse scenario in the FSAP stress test, which entails approximately a one
standard deviation shock to real GDP growth over the first two years of a five-year stress horizon. The FSAP
also conducted stress tests under two additional adverse scenarios (a two standard deviation shock to real GDP
growth and prolonged slow growth).
3

In addition to the EBA four, the other major UK banks in the FSAP solvency stress test sample include
Standard Chartered, Santander UK, and Nationwide. All major UK banks exceeded the Basel III and Financial
Service Authority hurdle rates in these scenarios. FSAP assumptions include haircuts to bank debt and
sovereign debt holdings in both the banking and trading books. The FSAP also includes liquidity stress tests of
the major UK banks, building societies, and foreign investment banks.

3
3.
On July 20, the EU Commission adopted a proposal to implement the Basel III
agreements through new EU-wide legislation. The package includes regulation and a
directive (“CRD4”), both of which are subject to approval through the EU Council and
Parliament—a process that will likely take at least six months. The proposal falls short of
IMF staff recommendations (see paragraph 50 of the staff report) and hence is a
disappointment. Specifically:


The common standards are too weak. The Commission suggests a common standard
(maximum harmonization) set at the level of Basel III minimum requirements.
Moreover, the Commission has softened the definition of core tier 1 capital relative to
the Basel III recommendations in some areas. In contrast, staff has called for common
standards that exceed the Basel III minima, given prevailing balance sheet
uncertainties and the lack of EU-wide resolution arrangements and a fully unified
fiscal backstop.



More flexibility is needed for macroprudential policies. National authorities can only
set system-wide higher capital requirements on loans secured by real estate or using
the Basel III countercyclical capital buffer, although they have more freedom with
regard to individual banks. National authorities are likely to need more flexibility to
use a range of macroprudential tools, given the uncertainty surrounding the tools
required for effective macroprudential policy and future macroprudential risks.



Furthermore, the Commission proposal lacks a firm commitment to implement the
leverage ratio or net stable funding ratio in 2018, as was agreed under Basel III.

It will be important to strengthen the legislation as it is finalized, including by creating
stronger common standards and ensuring sufficient flexibility for macroprudential policies.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on the United Kingdom
July 26, 2011
This note reports on information that has become available since the staff report
(SM/11/181) and staff supplement were issued and does not alter the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
1.
UK GDP grew at 0.2 percent (quarter-on-quarter, seasonally adjusted) in Q2
according to preliminary estimates released today. Several one-off factors, such as the
additional bank holiday associated with the royal wedding and the impact of supply-chain
disruptions in the wake of the Japanese earthquake and tsunami, affected growth during Q2.
The Office for National Statistics notes that it is not possible to be precise about the impact
of such special effects, but their broad-brush analysis indicates that these factors may have
had a net downward effect on Q2 GDP of 0.4 percent in the services sector and 0.1 percent in
the production sector. The GDP outturn is slightly lower than what staff had projected and
will be incorporated into the next update of staff’s projections for the September 2011 World
Economic Outlook. However, the outturn does not materially alter the central scenario of
continued recovery at a moderate pace.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
the United Kingdom
On July 27, 2011 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the United Kingdom. 1 This consultation
included a Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) under the IMF’s Financial
Sector Assessment Program, which analyzes financial sector health and associated
policies. It also included discussion of the first UK Spillover Report, which analyzes
spillovers emanating from UK policies to the rest of the world and is being conducted
this year for five systemic economies.
Background
Economic growth has recently been sluggish and inflation has been high in the UK,
though both indicators are projected to improve gradually over time. Recent increases in
indirect taxes and commodity prices will keep headline inflation well above 4 percent
during 2011. However, it should return near the 2 percent target by end-2012 as these
transitory factors dissipate and as significant spare capacity keeps underlying inflation in
check. Growth, which has also been adversely affected by spiking commodity prices, is
expected to gradually accelerate from around 1½ percent in 2011 to 2½ percent in the
medium term, as low interest rates and global growth support expansion led by net
exports and investment. Nonetheless, there are large risks around this central scenario,

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

including from uncertainties surrounding turmoil in parts of the euro area, headwinds
from fiscal consolidation, volatile commodity prices, and the housing market.
A wide-ranging policy program has been put in place to aid the post-crisis repair of the
UK economy. The agenda includes restoring confidence in public finances, moving to a
safer financial sector, and rebalancing the economy away from public and private
consumption and toward more sustainable sources of growth (net exports and
investment). As part of this program, the government has undertaken institutional reform
to address weaknesses in the policymaking framework. These reforms include moving
the microprudential regulator under the Bank of England (BoE), establishing a Financial
Policy Committee (FPC) to oversee macroprudential policy, and creating an
independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) aimed at strengthening the
credibility of fiscal analysis and forecasts.
The government has made progress on its medium-term fiscal consolidation plan, which
is a central component of its overall macroeconomic strategy. The cyclically adjusted
primary balance (as a percent of potential GDP) is estimated to have improved by about
2 percentage points in FY10/11. Going forward, the pace of adjustment is projected to
ease slightly and become increasingly reliant on spending restraint.
The BoE has maintained an accommodative monetary policy stance, with the Bank Rate
at 0.5 percent and the stock of outstanding asset purchases at £200 billion. This stance
reflects the BoE’s forecast that inflation will return to target over the forecast horizon,
taking into account disinflationary forces from fiscal consolidation.
Meanwhile, banks have strengthened their balance sheets and reduced funding
vulnerabilities over the last year, with all major banks ahead of schedule in their
transition to Basel III rules. Nonetheless, the recovery process is not yet complete.
Despite recent progress, funding risks remain a key vulnerability, as highlighted by the
FSSA.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed progress made in repairing the UK economy, including a
lower fiscal deficit, higher bank capital, and expanded employment. Nonetheless, they
noted that the combination of low growth and above-target headline inflation poses
policy challenges.
Directors considered the current mix of accommodative monetary and tight fiscal policy
to be appropriate. They noted that such a mix will help keep real interest rates low and
sterling competitive, thereby assisting public and private balance sheet repair while
rebalancing growth toward investment and net exports. This rebalancing is necessary if
robust growth is to be achieved at the same time that private and public consumption
are eased to more sustainable levels.

3

Directors noted that the growth outlook is subject to considerable uncertainties. They
agreed that policies may need to adjust in the event of a change in macroeconomic
conditions. In particular, if growth and inflation surprise on the upside, monetary
tightening would need to accelerate. Conversely, mounting evidence that weak demand
is likely to cause the economy to stall and enter a period of prolonged low growth would
call for looser macroeconomic policies.
Directors stressed the importance of accelerating structural reforms to promote
long-term fiscal sustainability and bolster the growth potential, along the lines outlined in
the authorities’ Growth Review. In this regard, they welcomed the creation of a
permanent Office for Budget Responsibility and supported the reform of the pension
system.
Directors noted that efforts to strengthen the resilience of the financial sector have
yielded improvements as bank capital levels have improved significantly and all major
banks passed the recent EU stress-tests. They considered, however, that the sector
remains vulnerable to risks relating to their funding model and their asset quality.
Directors concurred with the findings of the FSSA and called for implementing its
recommendations, including improving the standards for the public disclosure of
financial data. In this context, they welcomed the establishment of the FPC, whose
explicit mandate for macroprudential oversight should help reduce systemic risk.
Directors agreed with the conclusions of the spillover report that the UK’s potential for
spillovers is concentrated in the financial sector. They stressed that, given its central
position, the stability and efficiency of the UK financial sector is a global public good,
requiring that financial supervision and regulation be strengthened and held to the
highest standards. International cooperation between regulatory agencies in ensuring
effective cross-border resolution arrangements, group-wide liquidity management,
information sharing, and jurisdictional reciprocity will be essential for the UK to fulfill its
potential to support global financial stability.

Statement by Alex Gibbs, Executive Director for the United Kingdom
July 27, 2011
We thank staff for a very good and comprehensive set of documents based on a number of
productive staff missions in the first half of 2011. The reports appropriately capture the views
of my authorities and reflect the fact that, for the most part, they agreed with the staff
analysis and recommendations.
Outlook and recent economic developments
The 2011 Article IV mission took place just over six months after the 2010 Board discussion.
Since then, temporary factors have clouded assessment of the state of the UK economy. The
growth numbers have been choppy, with a contraction of 0.5 percent in 2010Q4 reversed by
growth of 0.5 percent in 2011Q1. However, as the staff report notes, other economic
indicators - including employment data, growth in tax revenues and manufacturing
performance - have been suggestive of a stronger recovery.
The weakness in the growth figures relative to forecast largely reflects the impact of
transitory factors, including rising energy prices, supply chain disruptions and weather
related shocks. The latest forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) projects
a sustained recovery, with 1.7 percent growth in 2011 continuing to strengthen before
peaking at 2.9 percent in 2013. This is consistent with rebalancing from private consumption
and government spending to net trade and investment. The latest survey data indicates that
corporate investment intentions remain strong.
On the inflation outlook, while headline inflation is currently at around 4¼ percent, reflecting
the increase in VAT, higher energy and import prices, and some rebuilding of companies’
margins, core inflation excluding indirect tax rises is just over 1 percent. Inflation is likely to
fall back through 2012 and into 2013 as the temporary impact of those factors wanes and
some downward pressure from spare capacity persists. Medium-term inflation expectations
remain contained and continue to be consistent with meeting the inflation target.
Fiscal Policy
In their last Article IV report, staff supported the UK Government’s commitment to fiscal
consolidation and its ambitious medium-term targets for adjustment, which themselves were
consistent with staff advice in previous Article IV consultations.
The 2011 Article IV report highlights that fiscal consolidation is still essential to reduce
fiscal risks and achieve a more sustainable budgetary position. My authorities welcome the
staff conclusion that the current path of fiscal consolidation remains appropriate in their
central case. Since the consolidation path was announced, yields on UK sovereign debt have
fallen significantly and remain below the levels at the onset of the euro-area sovereign debt

2
crisis. Retaining fiscal credibility is essential to maintain this improvement in market
confidence.
As staff’s very thorough analysis shows, risks still remain, both to the upside and the
downside. The economy is still some distance from the risk scenarios set out in the report but
the UK authorities are continuing to monitor developments closely. If risks do materialize,
the policy response will need to be calibrated to the nature and cause of the particular shock.
However, the successful implementation of the Government’s fiscal consolidation plan is the
key to maintaining confidence in debt sustainability and will continue to be a prerequisite in
any scenario.
Implementation is now fully underway. Consistent with previous staff advice, the plan is
tilted clearly to expenditure-based measures: of a total consolidation of £126 billion a year by
2015-16, £95 billion comes through spending cuts and £30 billion through taxation. The
Government has delivered the £6.2 billion of savings announced in May 2010 and has
implemented departmental budgets and the reforms to welfare and public service pensions
that were outlined in the October 2010 Spending Review. Where necessary, legislation has
now been introduced to Parliament. Mindful of the need to sustain commitment to
implementing spending measures over a period of years, my authorities have established a
Public Expenditure Cabinet Committee to oversee departments’ performance. On the revenue
side, the Government has put in place the planned 2011-12 tax reforms, including the
increase in the standard rate of VAT to 20 percent.
Nevertheless, my authorities remain committed to protecting Overseas Development
Assistance from the expenditure cuts, and their spending plans provide for achieving the
ODA target of 0.7 percent of GDP.
My authorities welcome the staff advice on further structural reforms that could help address
longer-term fiscal pressures and support medium-term growth. Measures have already been
taken. For example, the rise in the State Pension Age (SPA) from 65 to 66 has already been
brought forward to 2020 from 2026. My authorities have committed to bring forward
proposals to manage future increases in the SPA more automatically, as staff propose. Since
the Article IV mission, the OBR has published its first Fiscal Sustainability Report, which
looks at these issues in detail.
A key focus of the structural reform effort is to ensure sustainable growth, and to that end a
Growth Review, launched in November 2010, has identified a programme of structural
reforms to boost competitiveness and improve the business environment. The focus is on
reforms to the tax system, measures to encourage investment and rebalancing towards
exports and action to improve education and skills. Implementation is underway, with 16 of
182 proposed measures already implemented and major milestones passed in 92 others. The
second phase of the Growth Review was launched in June and will report in the autumn.

3

Fiscal Framework
The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) was established in May 2010 to
strengthen the fiscal framework and provide greater transparency and credibility to the
official economic and fiscal forecasts – in line with recommendations that the IMF had been
making to the UK authorities for a number of years. The OBR has now been placed on a
permanent, statutory footing and has produced all the official forecasts of the economy and
public finances since the General Election, independently of Ministers.
To promote transparent fiscal policy-making and strengthen the new fiscal framework, my
authorities have legislated a new requirement for each Government to set out its fiscal policy
objectives and fiscal mandate before Parliament in the Charter for Budget Responsibility.
The Government published the Charter on 4 April 2011.
Monetary Policy
The central view of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) continues to be that a margin of
spare capacity in the economy is likely to push down inflation and bring it back towards the 2
percent target in the medium term, as the impact of factors temporarily boosting inflation
subside. However material risks exist in both directions.
At its last meeting earlier this month, the Committee maintained its highly accommodative
monetary policy stance, with Bank Rate set at 0.5 percent and asset purchases of £200
billion. A minority of members voted for less accommodative policy - preferring higher
Bank Rate - and a smaller minority for an extension of asset purchases.
The MPC will continue to set policy to balance risks around the 2 percent inflation target. If
it becomes clear that one of those risks has crystallised – and the medium-term outlook for
inflation has deviated materially from the target – the Committee will change its monetary
policy stance accordingly. The MPC’s next decision will be on 4 August.
Financial Sector
This year's FSAP update comes at a critical time when reforms are being pursued in parallel
at the domestic, regional and global levels. Collaboration with the FSAP team was excellent
and my authorities have found the exercise extremely valuable for policy development. The
team has produced a detailed and comprehensive set of reports, including robust analysis and
a wide-ranging set of recommendations, which we intend to publish in full. My authorities
are now carefully considering how best to take these recommendations forward.

4
As staff note, the UK financial sector is on the mend. Conditions have continued to improve
with UK banks taking major steps to repair their balance sheets. Core tier 1 capital ratios are
now above 10 percent for all the major UK banks, the funding gap has continued to decline
and the dependence on wholesale funding has been significantly reduced. The in-depth
FSAP stress tests, which include haircuts to sovereign and bank debt, demonstrate that the
resilience of the sector has increased. Results show that banks have solid capital buffers and
are resilient against severe stresses - only an extreme “tail of the tail” risk, with multiple
severe shocks would pose a challenge to the banking system. Similarly, even under the
Fund’s new and most severe 30-day liquidity stress test scenario – which in effect tests
institutions to the point of failure – staff note that liquidity shortfalls remain largely
contained.
Having said that, my authorities remain mindful that challenges remain, particularly given
the ongoing uncertainties over the global economic outlook. For that reason, the UK is
continuing to strengthen its regulatory and supervisory frameworks. In particular, the FSA is
continuing to adopt a more proactive and intrusive supervisory approach, including for
example, the introduction of a proactive intervention framework to ensure that prudential
problems are tackled at an early stage. A new strengthened liquidity regime has also been
implemented that imposes stringent resilience requirements under stress conditions and
determines the approval of dividends and remuneration policy.
Many of the FSAP recommendations are already being taken forward through the overhaul
of the current system of financial regulation and supervision. Much progress has been made
since last September to lay the foundations for the move to the ‘triple peak’ model. An
interim version of the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) has been up and running since June
2011 – this will have a clear macroprudential remit to identify and address systemic risks.
Significant steps have also been taken to clarify the mandates for the new Prudential
Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority, which will have
responsibility for microprudential regulation and supervision, and conduct of business and
market regulation, respectively. The Government published a White Paper and draft Bill in
June, which will act as a blueprint for the reforms, and primary legislation is expected to be
introduced later this year.
The Government is particularly focused on tackling the risks posed by systemically important
financial institutions (SIFIs). The Independent Commission on Banking (ICB) has delivered
its interim report and is considering options on bail-in and the ring-fencing of retail banking
activities. The Government has endorsed these proposals and will take action to address these
issues once the ICB has delivered its final report in September, recognising the impact of
ongoing regulatory uncertainty.
As staff stress, a strong international response is vital. Stability in the UK financial sector
critically depends on a stronger international framework of oversight for cross-border SIFIs.

5
Given the risks of global regulatory arbitrage and the constraints on oversight of institutions
hosted in the UK, domestic reform alone will not ensure stability. The UK is therefore fully
committed to the development and implementation of an ambitious international regulatory
reform. We will continue to work closely with our European partners and our global partners
to ensure full implementation of the Basel III standards around the world. Like staff, we
believe national regulators do need discretion to go beyond those standards when national
circumstances require to safeguard financial stability. The UK has shown leadership on these
matters in international fora, and will continue to do so.
Finally, the Article IV staff report notes that the UK still needs to improve its disclosure of
financial sector data. My authorities fully agree and work is underway to deliver this. As part
of its commitment to encourage more market discipline, the PRA will seek to publish some
regulatory returns and the interim-FPC has requested the FSA to take action to make
enhanced disclosure of sovereign and banking sector exposures a permanent part of major
banks’ reporting framework. In addition, we have consented to publish all the UK FSAP
standard assessment reports and technical notes, including on stress testing, where the IMF
has pioneered extremely demanding liquidity tests. Together with the establishment of the
OBR, as an independent forecaster, and the publication of the whole of government accounts,
these measures represent a significant increase in the transparency of government.
Spillovers
The UK strongly supports the drive to improve the Fund's analysis of spillovers, particularly
its understanding of financial interlinkages. As with the other “S5” spillover reports, the
report on the UK is a good first step towards bridging the gap between the Fund's standard
bilateral and multilateral surveillance products.
The UK report focuses almost entirely on financial spillovers. We welcome the staff’s effort
to develop better understanding of some financial linkages that are not well captured - if at all
- in traditional models. Nevertheless we also recognise that, as with other work in this field,
gaps in the data and the lack of an established economists’ financial spillover toolkit
increased the difficulty of the task. This is an area of Fund surveillance that merits
significant further attention, alongside better modeling of real economy linkages, which the
spillover reports overall have tended to downplay.
We agree with the high-level conclusions of the report. The size and interconnectedness of
the UK financial sector make it a powerful originator, transmitter and potential dampener of
global shocks - more must now be done to understand the complexities of transmission
mechanisms and identify more clearly how and when the UK could potentially have these
different impacts. The report appropriately stresses the international dimension, as shocks
affecting the UK or transmitted through institutions based in the UK, frequently arise
elsewhere. Action taken domestically to strengthen capital and liquidity buffers may have an

impact on global asset and liability management, but the benefits for global financial stability
must surely exceed any potential efficiency costs. In general, we believe the objectives of
national and global financial stability are well aligned.
My authorities are strongly committed to continuing to engage in, and exercise leadership on,
the global financial repair and reform agenda. Effective global surveillance and regulation
will require sustained cooperation with European and global partners, particularly other
financial centres, through ongoing work at the IMF, FSB and ESRB.
