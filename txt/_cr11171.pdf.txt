SWEDEN
Staff Report for 2011 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2011 Article IV Consultation with Sweden
(in consultation with other Departments)
Approved by Anne-Marie Gulde-Wolf and Claire Waysand
June 24, 2011
Sweden has recovered strongly from the global recession. With growth and
strong fiscal credentials spurring significant krona appreciation from mid-crisis
lows, inflation is on target but unemployment remains elevated.
Given significant fiscal over-performance relative to the medium-term rule, there
is scope to maintain a neutral stance in 2011–12.
The pace of further monetary tightening alongside should remain measured, but
should accelerate if the output gap appears to be closing more quickly than
estimated or if wage settlements are excessive, and slow if strong krona
appreciation continues.
Though the housing market has recently begun to cool, a significant price
correction still seems necessary and likely.
While associated financial stability risks seem contained, further measures
should be implemented if significant macro prudential or consumer risks are
identified. Front-running Basel III requirements and improved internal
coordination will enhance stability further.
Consultation discussions were held in Stockholm during May 19–June 1, 2011.
The staff team—Mr. Doyle (head), Ms. Babihuga, Mr. Ishi (EUR) and
Mr. Gracia (FAD)—met with Finance Minister Borg, Riksbank Governor
Ingves, and other senior officials of the government, the Riksbank, the Financial
Supervisory Authority (FSA), and the National Debt Office. It also met with the
Parliamentary Finance Committee and representatives of the private sector,
including financial institutions, the manufacturing association, and the labor
union. Mr. Holmberg (OED) also participated in the mission.

3.
Total employment has regained pre-crisis levels, with both temporary and permanent
employment rising since 2009Q4. But the unemployment rate remains elevated, at close to
8 percent in April 2011, suggesting remaining spare capacity.
4.
Momentum continued, albeit slowing somewhat into 2011Q1. GDP rose 0.8 percent
quarter-on-quarter, with consumption slowing more markedly. Inventories continued strong
increases.
5.
With improved macroeconomic conditions, the financial system has regained strength
(Tables 2, 3, &4). Stock market indices are approaching pre-crisis peaks (Figure 4). Money
market spreads have remained above pre-crisis levels following the withdrawal of official

4
emergency liquidity support. Bank capital adequacy ratios have strengthened, and bank credit
default swap spreads remain well below the average of other European banks.
This has been achieved in the context of a measured withdrawal of policy stimulus
6.
Exit from the crisis intervention measures commenced in the Spring of 2010. The
Riksbank stopped offering 3 and 6 month loans, replaced by 28 day loans with a penal rate
and was among the first of advanced economy central banks to begin a tightening cycle, in
July 2010, after the global crisis. The policy rate was raised by 150 basis points to
1¾ percent (Figure 5). By the end of 2010, the Riksbank had terminated all crisis-time
liquidity measures and its balance sheet had contracted markedly. The government has kept
the bank debt guarantee and bank recapitalization programs open, but currently there is no
use of these programs.
7.
Rather than widening to over 2 percent of GDP as projected by both staff and the
authorities, the fiscal deficit narrowed from 0.9 percent of GDP in 2009 to 0.3 percent of
GDP in 2010, largely as automatic stabilizers responded to record growth (Tables 5 & 6 and
Figure 6). Hence, the fiscal is estimated to have been broadly neutral, 1½ a percentage point
of GDP smaller-than-projected.
8.
Strong growth and fiscal performance alongside capital inflows was reflected in
significant krona appreciation (Tables 7 & 8). Since the March 2009 mid-global crisis trough,
the krona appreciated by 23 percent in real effective terms—more than reversing its
depreciation during the crisis—as market concerns about sustainability in Europe intensified.
Throughout, the Riksbank eschewed discretionary intervention, accommodating both the
depreciation and subsequent appreciation (Box 1).
Box 1. Competitiveness and the Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate
Following its 23 percent real effective
appreciation from its mid-2009 trough, the krona
remains competitive, with qualitative caveats to
the standard measures not significantly affecting
this assessment (text table):



The MB and ES measures are qualified by risks that staff medium term macro
projections may fail to appropriately reflect a possible drop in consumer durables and
investment goods demand that might have resulted from the recent crisis.



Alongside other indicators, the staff assessment is that the currency is competitive.

5

The crisis has mixed legacies
9.
On the upside, exports have recovered. With demand sluggish in a number of its
traditional export markets, Sweden re-directed exports to other markets, away from Europe
and towards emerging markets, notably China.
10.
Further, despite the upswing in growth and surging commodity prices, inflation has
remained stable, partly due to the krona’s appreciation. Underlying inflation is stable around
the 2 percent target, although headline inflation has been rising somewhat mainly due to
mortgage interest costs directly affected by policy interest rate changes.
11.
And reflecting the external nature of the shock, the lasting impact on potential growth
appears to have been negligible. Staff estimates point to a decline in the growth rate of
potential real GDP of -0.5 percent in 2008–09 compared to 3 percent on average in
1997–2007, resulting from the decline in productivity growth, the capital stock and the
increase in structural unemployment. Potential GDP is estimated to have risen by 1 percent
during the recovery, reflecting renewed investment and productivity growth.

12.
On the other hand, estimates suggest that structural unemployment has risen
somewhat (see Attachment I). The unemployment rate increased significantly, peaking at
close to 10 percent in early-2010. Both its increase and persistence could have resulted into
spillover to the structural rate, even though its level is considerably lower than was
anticipated at the onset of the financial crisis. Moreover, there has been a significant increase
in the number of long-term unemployed—it more than doubled during the crisis and remains
one and a half times the pre-crisis level.
13.
And the output gap remains unclosed, at some 3 percent of GDP in 2010 (see
Attachment II). Although manufacturing capacity utilization had returned by end 2010 to
pre-crisis averages, unemployment remains high, and investment is increasing capacity.

The external environment has improved

External trade comprises over 90 percent of GDP, and total financial sector assets
sum to 550 percent of GDP, 40 percent of which are direct foreign exposures.

The broader global outlook is slightly
improved since the Fall 2010 WEO. While the
central projection for world growth in 2011–12 is
roughly unchanged, the 90 percent confidence
interval around these global projections has
narrowed by some 1½ percentage points (see text
table). But these prospects are bifurcated, with
emerging and developing economies projected to
grow at 6½ percent and advanced economies
growing at 2½ percent.

Sweden’s exports depend critically on global demand for consumer durables, capital
goods and inventories. While the global upswing in inventories has buoyed Swedish exports
in 2010, balance sheet and fiscal retrenchment in advanced countries may dent demand there
for consumer durables and capital goods in the medium term, making Sweden increasingly
dependent on alternative markets. And the krona remains under upward pressure, reflecting
ongoing market stress in Europe and a continued “search for strong sovereigns”, as well as
the Riksbank’s monetary tightening.
Some loss of growth momentum is expected in Sweden
17.
The Riksbank forecasts real GDP growth of 4.6 percent in 2011, with 90 percent
confidence intervals ranging from 2.5 percent to 7.6 percent.
18.
In staff’s central case, growth is projected to slow to 4.4 percent in 2011 and
3.8 percent in 2012, as the rebound’s temporary factors unwind, fiscal consolidation in
Europe slows external demand and krona appreciation weighs on exports (text figure &
Table 9). Near term growth will depend on private consumption and investment as the
overall policy stance remains supportive—interest rates are still low and the krona remains
competitive, and asset markets are buoyant. Exports will grow at a slower pace, reflecting
strong economic growth in non-traditional export markets.

19.
The staff central case scenario implies the output gap closing early in 2012. The gap
is projected at around 1–2 percent in 2011. However, if potential growth disappoints, perhaps
as a consequence of sustained unemployment, the gap could close more quickly.
Risks
20.
On the external side, higher-than-projected oil prices pose a downside risk to global
growth prospects. In an adverse scenario prepared by the WEO, a temporary surge in oil
prices to $150 per barrel in 2011—40 percent higher than the baseline—lowers global
growth in 2012 by two-thirds of a percentage point, with output losses much larger in the
event of a permanent shock. However, as oil intensity of output is low, the real and
inflationary implications are attenuated.

8
21.
Downside risks also stem from continued strains in the euro area periphery’s
sovereigns and banking systems. On WEO estimates, in a scenario in which these strains
spillover into the core, euro area growth could be lowered by 3 percentage points and global
output by 1 percentage point relative to the
Real house prices and private consumption
baseline WEO forecast.
22.
On the domestic side, concerns focus
on the housing market (see Box 2). In
particular, large house price falls could lower
consumption growth markedly, as has
occurred elsewhere (text figure).

III. SUSTAINING RECOVERY AND EMPLOYMENT
A. Fiscal Policy and Framework
Given that Sweden’s sovereign credentials are firm, fiscal policy has the latitude to continue
to support output in the short term as the output gap closes. But external tail risks call for the
maintenance of sizeable buffers relative to the fiscal rules.
For 2009–10, strong fiscal support to demand was planned
23.
To address possible weak global
conditions and their spillovers to the domestic
economy, an expansionary fiscal stance
for 2010 was anticipated. In contrast to
countries facing financing and/or
sustainability concerns, Sweden’s strong fiscal
credentials provided room for this maneuver.1
Thus, discretionary measures summing to
some 4 percentage points of GDP, of which
0.7 percent of GDP are crisis-related spending
stimulus measures, across 2009–10 were
planned (see text table). However, the
execution of stimulus measures was
incomplete, particularly at the local level.

Box 2: Sweden’s Housing Market: “Doomed” or “Different”?
The housing market has some echoes of recent boom-bust cases elsewhere. Like Denmark, Ireland, Spain,
the U.K. and the U.S., house prices and private debt have risen substantially, and price to income and
price to rent ratios are above historical norms. Is Sweden’s housing boom doomed to the same bust?

Sweden is similar in some ways to these cases, but is not the same. Since the 1980s, house price inflation
has fallen well short of the major European bust cases, although it is close to the U.S. Further, there has
been no surge in residential investment, which was curbed by the strict rent control system in the main
cities. And pre-crisis lending growth has been more tempered in Sweden and targeted at households, not
property developers.

Box 2: Sweden’s Housing Market: “Doomed” or “Different”? (Continued)
There is also some institutional reassurance of the
quality of the underlying lending. In particular,
mortgages are predominantly financed through
covered bonds, and the issuing banks remain
permanently liable for the quality of the
underlying mortgages. For comparison, Denmark
has similar arrangements and saw negligible
mortgage losses resulting from the recent
20 percent housing market correction. This
assessment is corroborated by data on the
distribution of mortgage credit by risk class, but
these data are only partial and a broader
perspective on this breakdown is needed (Text
figure).

An extensive recent Riksbank study is skeptical of the risk of house price declines, noting that even
recent price movements can be explained by “fundamentals”, such as low nominal interest rates. On
the other hand, the Swedish National Housing Credit Guarantee Board is less sanguine. It suggests
house prices are overvalued by some 20–25 percent.
Furthermore, actions have already been taken which will cool the market—and there are signs that they
have begun to be effective. The nominal policy rate of the Riksbank has been raised and further
increases are expected. And the financial supervisor imposed interest rate penalties on mortgages with
loan-to-value ratios exceeding 85 percent from October 2010.
The Riksbank finds that even if prices fall, various factors attenuate the associated financial stability
risks: (i) borrowers are subject to direct and life-long personal liability even after default and
foreclosure procedures, which limits banks’ mortgage losses; (ii) the well developed public insurance
system cushions borrowers’ income during downturns; and (iii) there is no buy-to-let market.
In summary, there is significant risk of a decline in house prices in coming years, even in a
relatively benign global economic scenario. Rising nominal interest rates are likely to be the catalyst,
supported by the micro-prudential measures taken by the financial supervisors. However, this is not
likely to cause significant macroeconomic disruption—with the construction sector relatively small,
and broader household confidence buoyed by global recovery—unless it is disorderly. In that case
consumption could be significantly affected. There is limited evidence that house price declines—of
even significant magnitude—pose significant financial stability risks.
Only in the event of multiple shocks—a perfect storm—including euro area strains transmitting to the
core is there risk of significant difficulties in the Swedish housing market. However, even in this case,
the consequences of the broader crisis will be difficult to distinguish from those arising more narrowly
from the domestic housing market which they would cause and through which they would flow.

These factors outweighed discretionary
1/ 2011 Spring Bill incorporates preliminary 2010 fiscal figures
deficit increasing measures of some
2.3 percentage points, with roughly two-thirds focused on tax measures—permanent cuts in
personal tax and social contributions. Crisis related stimulus measures on the spending side,
including local government grants to support public sector employment and welfare,
amounted to 0.1 percent of GDP. The structural surplus was also stronger by more than
1 percentage point of GDP than first projected, and at 1.4 percent of GDP, its outturn is
significantly larger than required to observe the fiscal rule (see Box 3).
1/

The underlying fiscal stance should remain unchanged in 2011–12
25.
As in 2010, the 2011 budget strikes a balance between supporting demand and
reinforcing underlying credentials—rightly shifting emphasis to the latter as the economy
recovers. Accordingly, its focus is on strengthening the supply side spending initiatives by
0.4 percent of GDP in 2011 to further encourage long term employment and labor supply,
strengthen welfare and improve the environment. The long-term impact of labor market
related measures is estimated at 250,000 new jobs by 2015 and a reduction of the equilibrium
rate of unemployment from 6½ in 2006 to 5 percent by 2015.

Box 3: Fiscal Policy Framework
The fiscal framework has three key elements: (i) an unlegislated surplus target established at 1 percent
of GDP over the business cycle; (ii) a rolling central government nominal expenditure ceiling
established for three years ahead, with a new “third year ceiling added each year, and (iii) a balanced
budget requirement for local governments. In implementing this, the Riksdag first sets the total
expenditure allocations. Appropriations within that ceiling are determined separately and later.
Nominal expenditure ceilings, once established, have not been revised beyond technical adjustments
providing predictability to government spending.
During the recent economic crisis, of the five indicators used by the authorities to assess compliance
with the framework, only the backward looking 10 year net lending average is marginally below the
1 percent surplus target in 2010 and is projected to remain below in 2011. All other indicators are
above the fiscal target, some with considerable margin, including the structural balance. Though staff
estimates of structural fiscal balances differ from those of the authorities, these also show overperformance relative to the rules (see Attachment II).

The 2011 budget adds three additional features to the standard framework, all aimed to underscore the
authorities’ caution. First, the horizon for the expenditure ceiling was extended from three to four years
ahead (text figure). This is intended to underpin confidence in the sustainability of the return to fiscal
surpluses. Second, building on earlier practice, the appropriated expenditures to 2014 have been set
below the expenditure ceiling by 1 percentage point of GDP annually—a considerably increased
“safety margin”, even though the assessment of risks has been adjusted from “downside” to
“balanced”. Large years-ahead budgetary margins should be taken with caution as they will be
automatically reduced with permanent fiscal reforms approved in prior years. And, third, preferring to
make “permanent” fiscal reforms only once the domestic and international outlook is more certain, the
authorities have postponed to 2012 their ambitions for tax reductions.

13
26.
In the absence of new initiatives, the structural balance strengthens automatically, in
part due to fiscal drag and the non-indexation of key expenditures, as reflected in the
authorities’ projections. This creates space for new measures, consistent with staff advice to
maintain the structural fiscal balance. Rather than using this available fiscal space for
planned tax reductions in 2011, the authorities have maintained an extra fiscal buffer in view
of remaining domestic and external macroeconomic uncertainties. However, they plan tax
reductions in 2012 up to 0.7 percent of GDP, provided structural education and welfare
reforms are also approved. Tax measures under consideration include, among others,
reinforcing the in-work tax credit, raising the lower income tax bracket for the state income
tax, reducing taxes for pensioners, reducing the income tax for residents abroad, reducing the
VAT on restaurants and catering services, and increasing the excise tax on alcohol and
tobacco. On the spending side, education and infrastructure investment will also be priorities
in the 2012 budget.
Fiscal policy is set to over-perform in the medium term
27.
The authorities are building sizeable fiscal buffers by increasing the “safety margins”
between the spending ceilings and appropriated spending. While the fiscal risks even in the
event of a dramatic domestic housing market downturn are minor, increased margins are key
to address elevated external tail risks, particularly those coming from the euro area2.
28.
Even so, this allows a broadly neutral fiscal stance in 2011 and 2012. Only in the
unlikely event of significant sustained krona overvaluation would there be need to shift the
underlying stance for 2012 to a tightening.
29.
Thus, the stage is set for more permanent fiscal reforms in 2012 and these are rightly
focused on increasing labor participation. The income-tax credits reduce the tax wedge for
low earners while reducing the state income tax could increase hours worked by increasing
the marginal effective tax rate. Other measures under consideration, particularly the
reduction in the VAT on restaurants, have more questionable impact on labor demand and
lower overall compliance.
The Fiscal Policy Council remains a pillar of the system
30.
Its tasks include evaluation of the extent to which medium-term fiscal policy goals
are being achieved and the quality of forecasts. To be a fully effective watchdog, it needs to
be adequately resourced in a way that secures confidence in its technical expertise, continuity
and independence. And its mandate needs to be more narrowly focused on assessing the
fiscal stance and conformity of policy with medium-term stability and sustainability goals.
2

Direct taxation from housing is limited even for local governments. Thus, the fiscal stance is affected more by
broader macroeconomic downturns than by narrower housing market developments.

14
B. Monetary Policy and Framework
Monetary policy rates should continue to rise steadily given that the krona is still competitive
and housing richly valued.
Inflation has been moderate
31.
Headline inflation has risen back
to the target of 2 percent, whereas
inflation excluding mortgage interest
costs has remained somewhat lower at
1½ percent. Upward pressures arising
from higher energy and commodity
prices have been partially offset by the
stronger krona, while nominal wage
growth has remained contained, and
house price growth has flattened.

Sources: Haver and Fund staff estimates.

Nevertheless, with recovery, inflation risks have risen
32.
Although unemployment remains high compared to its pre-crisis level, and the output
gap, though falling, appears to remain significant, capacity utilization has returned to an
historical average and business surveys indicate desire to raise employment further in some
sectors. New wage negotiation rounds for 2011–12 will commence in Fall 2011.
Thus, a tightening cycle has began, with further increases indicated
33.
Since July 2010, the near-zero policy interest rate has been raised to 1¾ percent in a
series of 25bp steps. The Riksbank has, as usual, published its projections for the policy rate,
showing further rises of some 25bp at every monetary policy meeting over the next 12
months. The markets anticipate a broadly similar path. But with the real policy rate currently
negative, the stance is nevertheless expected to remain accommodative in coming months,
even as buoyant activity continues to close the remaining output gap.
34.
In this context, measures of inflation expectations based on break-even rates for
indexed government bonds, as well as those based on survey results, have broadly been
anchored in the neighborhood of the target.
The indicated further interest rate increases are appropriate
35.
An acceleration of the anticipated path would be required if assessments of output
gap, wage settlement in the ongoing wage round, commodity prices, and house prices signal
higher-than-expected inflationary pressures.

15
36.
But, on the other hand, the outlook for the krona will also remain central. If it
continues to appreciate strongly, and continues to negate not only the second round but also
the headline effects of rising global commodity price rises, a partial retreat even from the
anticipated path will be appropriate.
The monetary and exchange regimes remain appropriate
37.
The credibility of the free floating exchange rate arrangement and flexible inflation
targeting regimes have been emphatically reinforced by their effectiveness through the recent
global crisis.
38.
Monetary policy should remain focused on the inflation target, helping to stabilize
output and employment subject to that condition. Other objectives—including asset and
house prices and financial stability—have not been explicit objectives of monetary policy.
This remains appropriate, though there is need to strengthen coordination mechanisms with
the other agencies responsible for these broader objectives (See Section IV). Such
coordination could be essential to effective management of strains that may yet emerge in the
housing market.
C. Labor Market Issues
Over the medium term, further efforts are needed to drive unemployment down to 5 percent
on a sustained basis.
39.
With signs of increased equilibrium unemployment and the long-term unemployed
high, the challenge is to prevent cyclically high unemployment from becoming protracted
and structural. Total employment is now back to pre-crisis levels. But some jobs lost during
the crisis, especially in the manufacturing sector, are not likely to be replaced.
40.
Crisis measures taken to address unemployment during the recession—including
policies focused on lessening the fall in employment such as local government employment
support and increasing the short term unemployed in labor market programs—will need to be
gradually adjusted in light of new developments in the labor market. While business
representatives emphasized the need for lower taxation and greater flexibility in regulations,
particularly with respect to small and micro firms, the labor unions were more concerned
with the quality of labor supply and longer term education and training initiatives. According
to the OECD, further steps are needed to reduce the duality in employment protection
legislation, further strengthen job-search incentives for the unemployed, and reform
minimum wage structures.
41.
Accordingly, policies should continue to reduce unemployment rates without
lowering adult participation rates. This puts a premium on lowering labor market frictions,
including impediments to matching. With various tax and labor market actions to this end
already taken, the authorities project equilibrium unemployment at 5 percent in the

16
medium-term (¶24). However, achieving this projection will also require moderate wage
increases in 2011–12, as well as the introduction of permanent concessionary wage
determination arrangements for new entrants to the labor market.

IV. FINANCIAL SECTOR STABILITY
Resilience to external tail risks requires decisive further steps to strengthen banking stability.
The system is large, concentrated, and complex
42.
The financial system’s assets are equivalent to 5½ times GDP. Four major banking
groups dominate the system (65 percent of market share) and have extensive cross-border
operations and non-banking activities, with substantial reliance on wholesale funding
markets (Figure 7).
But its resilience has strengthened considerably
43.
Major banks have raised capital to well above the minimum regulatory requirements,
with the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio ranging from 7½–10 percent (11–15 percent with
full Basel II rules, see text table)—comparable with their European and American peers.
Their exposures to peripheral European economies are small, and their loan losses in the
Baltics have fallen. The authorities indicate that each of these major banks has sufficient
resources to meet the forthcoming Basel III capital requirements, including the capital
conservation and counter-cyclical capital buffers. Meanwhile, the financial strength of the
non bank financial sector, such as insurance and pensions, has also improved (Figure 8).

17
So exit from crisis intervention measures is underway
44.
The authorities have terminated most of their unconventional liquidity support
measures. Of the remaining measures, government debt guarantee and recapitalization
programs are expected to be terminated by end-June 2011. The Riksbank is reviewing the
collateral policy framework, which was expanded during the crisis.

1/ With the transition rules. Under the Basel II capital adequacy rules, Swedish banks are allowed to substantially reduce capital adequacy requirements due to their large mortgage
portfolios. However, currently, the FSA applies transitional regulations, allowing banks to reduce capital requirements only in stages.

And regulations are being strengthened
45.
The authorities’ intention is to go further and faster than the Basel III timeline. The
details of the new requirements have yet to be worked out, but the FSA and MOF have
already indicated that common equity Tier 1 capital requirements would be at least
10–12 percentage points in a few years. In this regard, with bank capital already strong
relative to final Basel III goals, there is no need for the phase-in period, provided that banks
maintain the current levels of their capital. In part, this provides additional insurance against
the possibility of significant risk spillovers from the periphery to the euro area core.
46.
In December 2010, the FSA adopted a new regulation on the governance of banks’
liquidity risk management. A new comprehensive liquidity reporting framework will
commence in July 2011, which includes quantitative liquidity risk measures by currency
(comparable with a liquidity coverage ratio proposed by the Basel III). Thereafter, these
measures will become subject to disclosure requirements, before being upgraded to binding
prudential requirements, although specific timeline and detailed metrics have yet to be
developed.
47.
These regulatory reforms should be consistent with forthcoming EU-level decisions.
However, Sweden’s financial system is exposed to unique challenges––large, complex, and
concentrated––and entailing “too large to fail” risks. It operates extensively across borders,

18
but in this regard, even in the Scandinavian context, it has been difficult to establish a legally
binding ex-ante cross-border bank resolution framework. Accordingly, effective
discretionary supervision―including the active use of the Pillar II framework and the
application of capital and liquidity surcharges to systemically important banks―will be an
essential complement to the new Basel III and EU capital directives, especially if these
international frameworks do not take account of each member country’s idiosyncratic risk
profile.
Furthermore, three issues warrant close and ongoing assessment
48.
These are euro area tail risks, housing, and risks associated with the oversized
financial system.
The FSAP provides initial reassurance on credit risks, and warns on liquidity
49.
It finds Sweden’s financial system is generally sound. Its credit assessment is not
predicated on euro area tail risks, but rather on an adverse macroeconomic scenario—
prolonged low growth and a domestic housing market crash. In this context, it finds that all
major banks would maintain 7 percent common equity Tier 1 capital ratios required under
Basel III.
50.
On the other hand, the liquidity assessment, even without considering directly the
feedback loops in housing, finds in stress scenarios that banks could face difficulties given
their reliance on wholesale funding (Box 4).
An even broader perspective provides some further reassurance
51.
Sweden appears well-situated even in a euro area tail risk scenario. Direct exposures
to peripheral European economies are minimal. And indicators of overall exposures of
Swedish institutions to peripheral risks—albeit excluding the possibility of significant
spillover to the euro area core—show reduced market concerns about Swedish institutions
since mid-2009, even though the euro area strains have deepened in various ways since then
(text figure). Such reassuring assessments can turn suddenly, however, if markets reevaluate
the risks of major strains spilling over to the core.

Box 4. Liquidity Risk
By 2008, the share of banks’ funding through non-deposit sources reached nearly half of their
lending, in excess even of the relatively high
median for European peers. Meanwhile,
Swedish banks aggressively expanded cross
border activities with substantial Euro
exposure, including in the Baltics.
Several Swedish banks experienced difficulty
in rolling over their debt obligations,
particularly after the collapse of Lehman
Brothers in September 2008. This was
reflected in a sharp increase in the risk
premium in the Swedish interbank markets.
In response, the authorities implemented
unprecedented liquidity easing measures.
Currently, the authorities are tightening the
regulatory framework on liquidity risk
management. In December 2010, the FSA
adopted a new regulation on “Management
of Liquidity Risks in Credit Institutions and
Investment Firms” (FFFS 2010:7), which
requires financial institutions to establish a
proper governance framework for liquidity
risk management. The FSA is also introducing a new comprehensive liquidity reporting
framework in July 2011, which covers detailed information on liquidity reserves, cash flows,
funding, and derivatives by currency, and banks will be required to report the Liquidity
Coverage Ratio (LCR) by major currencies (Swedish kroner, euro, and U.S. dollar) in line with
the Basel III agreement. Further options remain under consideration, to go further and faster
than the Basel III requirements.
Already, these moves have induced a
behavioral change in banks: the Riksbank’s
structural liquidity measure―an indicator
similar to Basel III net stable funding ratio―
improved for most major banks, although
Swedish banks are still behind other
European banks.

20

52.
On the housing side, the concern is if a shock to house prices was to impair
confidence in the covered bond market (see Box 5). High collateral margins and routine
cleansing of the pool establishes a high degree of resilience against such risks. And, as
illustrated during the recent global crisis, the authorities possess and use tools to respond
even if confidence nevertheless falters. In particular, when the private market in covered
bonds effectively shut down after the Fall of 2008, the Riksbank accepted a wider range of
covered bonds as collateral and the NDO purchased covered bonds in exchange of treasury
securities. Thus, the momentum of credit supply to households was largely undisturbed,
despite the shock. A sustained drop in house prices of some 40 percent would be required to
reduce the value of collateral pools below the face value of the outstanding bonds.
53.
The household debt-to-income ratio has more than doubled since the mid-1990s, with
mortgages explaining most of this increase, in part reflecting the absence of a buy-to-let
market. Moreover, available data to 2007 confirm that high net worth households account for
the bulk of Swedish household debt. Given the large debt-to-income and elevated house
prices, it would be important to confirm that the debt service patterns by more recent
generations of house buyers continue to adhere to the standards maintained by their forebears.
In this context, additional data of credit quality, including historical data on mortgage service
by vintage of house purchase, as well as bank lending activities to households, would need to
be collected and monitored. These data would help further strengthen the robustness of stress
tests and supervisory assessment of capital risk weights.
54.
On the other hand, if significant financial stability or consumer risks are identified,
further actions to cool housing markets would be needed to ensure credit quality. Lower
mortgage interest deductions and loan-to-value ratios, introduction of debt-to-income
regulations, and adjustments to risk weight assets would be amongst the options to be
considered in this context.
55.
On financial system size, the main risks are being addressed indirectly. In particular,
the proposed strengthening of liquidity regulations will likely curb the growth of the banking
sector by limiting scope for the sector to free-ride on the public liquidity backstop. In these
circumstances, and with credit risks also contained—as the global crisis revealed and the
FSAP stress tests reiterate—Sweden’s strong fiscal credentials enable it to sustain the
associated risks, setting Sweden apart from others with similarly oversized financial sectors.
However, ongoing maintenance of effective regulatory and supervisory oversight of these
risks will be absolutely essential.
This broader perspective underscores the main FSAP recommendations
56.
First, the FSA’s budgetary resources should be raised further to ensure its ongoing
effectiveness—not least given the size of the financial sector it supervises. There is also need
to focus its mandate more closely on core stability rather than broader social concerns.

Box 5. The Swedish Covered Bond Market
Outstanding stock of coverd bonds and central government debt
The outstanding stock of covered bonds stands at
(In percent of GDP)
over 50 percent of GDP, up from below 20 percent
of GDP in the mid-2000s. Investor appetite
improved since the enactment of the 2004 Swedish
Covered Bond Act, under which investors are
secured by “double recourse:” they have recourse
to both the collateral pool backing the specific
covered bond program and to the estate of the bank
on its default. Loans cannot exceed
fixed percentages of collateral value—75, 70, and
60 percent for residential, agricultural and
commercial mortgages respectively—with collateral frequently revalued, and all impaired mortgages are
“cleansed” from the pools frequently, and are replaced by unimpaired loans.

Swedish banks’ reliance on covered bond funding
for housing finance has also increased rapidly. The
amount of covered bond issuance as a share of total
mortgage lending rose has doubled to 80 percent
since 2006. Also, funding costs of covered bonds
are lower than those of alternative means, such as
senior debt issuance, contributing to lower
mortgage interest rates, thereby stimulating
mortgage demand.

Despite the “double recourse” mechanism, Swedish
covered bonds markets were adversely affected by
the global crisis. In late 2008-early 2009, covered
bond spreads over treasury securities yields
significantly widened, and demand for covered
bonds, in both primary and secondary markets, fell
sharply. The decline in investor appetite was
particularly evident in euro markets. In response, the
Riksbank accepted a wider range of covered bonds as
collateral, the NDO issued treasury securities, beyond
its funding needs, and invested the funds in covered
bonds to support covered bond markets, and the
government introduced the bank debt guarantee
program.

Accordingly, covered bonds—and their originators, banks— would not be immune to shocks. For
example, a fall in house prices could result in a decline in investor appetite for covered bonds, leading to
higher interest rates or even refinancing risks, as occurred in some peripheral European economies.
Furthermore, although covered bonds are protected from liquidity risks due to asset and liability
matching requirements, this merely means that final mortgage borrowers bear liquidity risks. Thus banks
would most likely shoulder indirect risks if markets are hit by shocks.

22
57.
Second, there is need to enhance mechanisms to coordinate the various authorities
with mandates concerning financial stability. A Systemic Financial Stability Council (SFSC)
with representation from the Riksbank, FSA, NDO, and MOF—could serve this purpose,
coordinating both preemptive and reactive stability policies. Its mandate would need to
specify the limits of its powers to direct its members’ actions—particularly regarding those
which are formally independent and in regard to confidential information—as well as its
internal decision-making mechanisms. The Committee on the Review of the Regulatory
Framework has been set up, with a view to presenting its recommendations on regulatory
reform to the government in August 2012.
58.
However, given external vulnerabilities, action should not await completion of the
Committee’s recommendations. The principles of the Riksbank, FSA, NDO, and MOF could
commence immediately routine quarterly meetings to review macroprudential risks and
coordinate policy settings. Initial topics to be examined include prudential risks pertaining to
housing, the risks arising from broader euro area strains, and related policy options, such as
the appropriate level of international reserves.3
59.
A review of the stability fund framework may have merits. Sweden is among those
economies that introduced a financial stability fund and fee during the crisis. There are good
grounds to review options to merge the stability and deposit insurance funds and to introduce
risk-based fees.
60.
Finally, a special bank resolution framework—a long standing agenda— should be
introduced.
61.
Sweden has made significant progress in addressing deficiencies in its AML/CFT
framework identified by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in 2006. In particular, the
FSA’s regulations have been strengthened, including in areas of customer due diligence and
reporting of suspicious transactions and compliance. As a result, the FATF has removed
Sweden from the list of its regular follow up members in October 2010.
V. THE AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS
62.
Sweden has recovered decisively from the global financial crisis, reflecting strong
policies domestically and globally, as well as the legacy of many years of decisive structural
reforms. In this context, the stance of policies––especially on the monetary side––should,
provided developments turn out as now expected, continue to tighten in measured fashion,
and buffers should continue to be reinforced on the fiscal and financial sector sides to address
external risks. In this context, continued moderation of wage growth in the negotiation round
commencing in the Fall is essential to sustaining strong overall performance and job growth.
3

See Attachment III.

23
Alongside, there is need for special arrangements to address long term unemployment and
labor market entrants issues. The staff agree with these central assessments.
63.
Notwithstanding that overall consensus, there are some differences in nuance and
emphasis.
64.
First, on the current conjuncture, and according to the Riksbank’s estimates, the
output gap narrowed to roughly negative ½ percent in 2011—closer to balance than Ministry
of Finance and staff estimates. The latter suggest an output gap of up to negative 2 percent
in 2011. Differences reflect, among other matters, assumptions about potential, with the
Riksbank taking the view that growth in productivity has slowed down compared to the
strong growth between the mid-90s and 2006, yielding potential GDP growth at just above
2 percent. This compares with long run estimates of 2½ percent for staff. In addition, the
Riksbank and staff project, at present, the long run equilibrium rate of unemployment on
currently announced policies to be around 1 percentage point higher than anticipated by the
Ministry of Finance.
65.
Second, while the authorities expect further dampening of house prices as policy rates
rise, they emphasized that this was unlikely to be destabilizing to the macroeconomic outlook
or to pose risks to financial stability, given that house prices were broadly in line with
fundamentals. Nevertheless, they acknowledged risks posed by buoyant housing and
household indebtedness, and noted that prices had begun to dampen following recent new
loan-to-value regulations and policy interest rate increases. Further prudential measures
would be taken in the event of a resurgence of house prices to head off risks.
66.
Third, in the context of agreement with staff that the fiscal position was strong, and
that buffers should be strengthened further, the authorities’ estimate of the underlying fiscal
position differs from staff. The difference reflects estimates of the size of the output gap and
the more aggregated methodology to adjust for cyclical components used by the authorities.
This reflects the authorities’ use of the OECD aggregate elasticity of 0.55, in contrast to the
staff’s disaggregated adjustments using both output and employment gaps. Specifically, the
fiscal authorities’ estimates of the cyclically adjusted balance in 2009–10 are 3 and
1.8 percent of GDP, while staff’s estimates are 1.3 and 1.4 percent of GDP.
67.
Fourth, the staff agree with the authorities on the scope for further fiscal initiatives
in 2012 and beyond, and that these should focus on improving the functioning and flexibility
of the labor market. However, the authorities are proposing as a further option the reduction
of the rate of VAT on restaurants on the basis that this will boost employment in that sector.
68.
Fifth, with regard to the Fiscal Policy Council, the authorities consider that its
mandate has recently been sufficiently narrowed towards focus on medium-term
sustainability. And they suggest that in the Swedish context, its watchdog role and
independence are well anchored by continuing the arrangement whereby it reports to the
government.

24
69.
On the financial side, the authorities assessed stability as strong, but, supported by
staff in light of the given external risks, initiatives have been taken to sustain buffers or to
raise buffers further. In that context, the authorities expressed considerable concern that the
EU-level negotiations might constrain the ability of member states to differentiate regulatory
requirements to take account of idiosyncratic vulnerabilities––such as the size of the sector––
and noted the consequent risks. In addition, they will consider the feasibility of collecting
data by vintage of house purchase, but do not expect it to change their overall assessment of
robustness.
70.
As part of efforts to strengthen buffers in the financial sector, the authorities also
want to be able to impose stronger liquidity requirements than Basel III.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
71.
Sweden’s exit from the global crisis has been uniquely successful compared to others
in the European Union, reflecting strong global and domestic policies.
72.
In 2010, output rose 5½ percent and this momentum has been maintained into 2011.
Unemployment is down from its mid-crisis peak, and core inflation has remained close to
target throughout. Financial sector strains have been contained, bank capital and liquidity
have strengthened, and most emergency stabilization measures have been withdrawn. With
over-observance of the fiscal rules, the government budget is now heading decisively back to
its customary surplus and public debt remains some 40 percent of GDP and falling.
Alongside, a cautious monetary tightening cycle is under way, together with macrofinancial
measures to cool housing. And the krona remains competitive.
73.
The laggards in recovery are long-term and youth unemployment, and fixed
investment—which, although rising again, is still below 2006–08 levels relative to output.
And there are concerns that although house prices have recently dipped, they may still be
overvalued.
74.
The challenge now is to sustain this success. This will require continued close
coordination of policies.
75.
To this end, the underlying fiscal stance should remain unchanged in 2011–12. Given
the remaining output gap and with the structural balance in 2010 considerably stronger than
required to meet those medium-term targets, there is a case to maintain a neutral stance
in 2011–12, notwithstanding buoyant growth. The 2011 budget delivers this while building
buffers by increasing the “safety margins” between the spending ceilings and appropriated
spending, and by postponing planned tax reductions to 2012.
76.
This underlying budget stance should remain for 2012, and for the same reasons.
Only in the unlikely event that significant sustained krona overvaluation occurs would there
be need to shift the underlying stance for 2012 to a tightening.

25
77.
With the underlying fiscal stance unchanged, a mix of expenditure and tax initiatives
will be feasible in 2012. Of the latter under consideration, emphasis on the steps to
strengthen labor market performance—expansion of the earned income tax credit—is
recommended.
78.
Alongside, the Fiscal Policy Council remains a key element of the fiscal framework.
In formal recognition of its watchdog role, it could be made directly accountable to
Parliament, its resourcing should be enhanced, and, building on the recent review by the
authorities, its mandate could be even more narrowly focused on medium-term fiscal
sustainability.
79.
The monetary stance should continue to tighten in 2011 as indicated. If assessments
of the output gap, wage developments, and commodity and house prices signal stronger
inflationary pressures, the policy rate should be raised more rapidly than indicated. But if the
krona continues to appreciate strongly, then the path for the policy rate rises may need to be
delayed to offset its disinflationary effects.
80.
The free floating exchange rate regime Sweden maintains has clearly served well
during the global crisis, and appropriately will be retained.
81.
Within this free floating framework, while international reserves are sufficient to
address risks, given euro area strains, this judgment of reserve adequacy should remain under
active review in view of the financial sector’s exposures.
82.
Sustained falls in unemployment remain a priority. In this context, moderate
settlements in the 2011–12 wage round—in the neighborhood of 3 percent—will be key. As
part of this, significant permanent concessionary arrangements for labor market entrants in
the negotiated wage agreements would be highly desirable.
83.
External fragilities underscore need for further progress on financial stability. The
FSAP assessment provided initial reassurance on credit risks. But historical data on mortgage
service by vintage of house purchase should be collected to confirm this. Such data could
also inform adjustments to capital risk weights and the specification of technical parameters
used in stress tests. But, if significant financial stability or consumer risks are identified,
further macroprudential measures will be needed to ensure that these credit risks do not
deteriorate.
84.
Furthermore, given the unique characteristics and risks of the Swedish financial
system—including risks that euro area periphery strains spillover to the core—the
authorities’ intention to go further and faster than Basel III regulations are appropriate. With
bank capital already strong relative to ultimate Basel III goals, there is no need for the phasein period. Alongside, following the recent strengthening of monitoring of liquidity, the early
introduction of strong liquidity regulations, taking particular account of risks in foreign
currencies is encouraged. Systemic capital and liquidity surcharges to internalize risks posed

26
to the system will also be appropriate. Effects on credit growth from all these actions should
be factored in to decisions on the policy rate.
85.
The FSAP also recommended a number of institutional reforms: reviewing options to
merge the stability and deposit insurance funds; introducing a special bank resolution
framework; and establishing of all key macroprudential institutions to strengthen
coordination. The establishment of the Committee on the Review of the Regulatory
Framework set up to consider such institutional arrangements is welcome.
86.
And the FSAP confirmed long-standing calls from the IMF to increase further the
resources allocated to banking supervision. Given the unique characteristics of the financial
system, effective discretionary supervision will be an essential complement to the new
regulatory frameworks coming into effect under Basel III and European auspices, especially
if these international frameworks constrain country-level discretion above floors.
87.

Sweden should remain on the standard 12-month consultation cycle.

ATTACHMENT I—HOW LARGE IS SWEDEN’S OUTPUT GAP?1
1.
The Swedish economy has rebounded strongly; real GDP and manufacturing capacity
utilization levels were back to pre-crisis levels at end-2010. And asset prices have remained
buoyant, for the most part the outcome of the monetary expansion during the crisis.
Reflecting these gains, the authorities have begun tightening monetary policy. But
unemployment remains high, and fixed investment as a share of GDP remains below precrisis levels. Hence, assessment of the output gap and the rate at which it is closing is key for
the Riksbank’s ability to calibrate the policy rate path. Failure to sufficiently adjust in
advance could result in having to raise interest rates even more sharply, potentially
undermining the recovery.
2.

Output gap estimates vary among analysts, with the Riksbank at the low end.

3.
This attachment examines the output gap using several methodologies. In summary,
staff estimate the output gap at 2½–3½ percent of potential GDP in 2010. The recent crisis
does not appear to have affected the level of potential output. However, there is some
evidence that in the short-term, the equilibrium rate of unemployment may have risen
somewhat and the pace of capital formation has slowed. As a result the rate of potential
growth has likely slowed, although these effects are unlikely to be permanent. Thus, the
output gap is likely to close somewhat gradually.
4.
Estimates proposed by staff in 2006–07
for potential output suggest a positive gap
in 2010. These estimates anticipated a slowdown
in the growth rate of potential output (from
3 percent in 2007 to 1½ percent in 2012) given
that the economy was reaching full capacity in
2006–07—with the growth rate of potential

output peaking at 3.3 percent in 2006. Extrapolating this peak growth rate would have
implied a negative output gap of close to 3 percent in 2010, with the gap closing substantially
from 2009–10.
5.
Notwithstanding the projected decline in potential growth, staff estimates of the
output gap during the 2009 Article IV Consultation had the following features: (i) they
assumed little crisis-induced damage to potential output, given that the source of the shock
was external and demand driven; and (ii) they projected a large negative output gap in 2010,
reflecting the sharp output contraction and a gradual return to full capacity.
6.

These various staff assessments are updated below.
A. Univariate Models

7.
These models present simple techniques for separating long run trends from the
cyclical components of GDP. Three univariate methods have been used: the Hodrick-Prescott
(HP) filter; the Christiano-Fitzgerald band-pass filter (CF); and the Kalman filter.2
8.
The different approaches yield varying results, but point to significant spare capacity
in the economy. Excluding the CF filter, the output gap is estimated in the order of negative
5–6 percent in 2009 and negative 2½–3½ percent in 2010.

Yet, univariate models may not provide robust output gap measures. During
economic crises—and large structural changes—univariate methods are particularly prone to
bias, given that they rely on historically patterns of observable variables. Moreover, to the
extent that the downturn entailed structural changes in the economy as opposed to cyclical
phenomenon, the standard smoothing parameters would incorrectly attribute some of the
decrease in output to cyclical movements rather than structural decreases in potential
2

These approaches are summarized in the appendix.

46
output—hence overstating the output gap. The same is true during the upswing—univariate
filters are likely to attribute most of the change in actual output to cyclical changes—
assuming that potential output remains broadly unchanged—thus understating the negative
gap in 2010–11.
10.
Also, because univariate filters are not model based, their results are not necessarily
supported by economic intuition. The HP and CF in particular suffer from end-point bias3
and thus may not be suitable for forward looking policy decisions.
B. Growth Accounting—Production Function Approach
11.
In light of these shortcomings, model based approaches are developed below: first, a
production function approach; and second: a small macro model. Notably, the latter
incorporates additional economic information in order to improve the robustness of output
gap measures, as well as correct for some of the standard biases implicit in filtering
techniques.
12.
Potential output and the output gap are estimated on the basis of Cobb-Douglas
production function, and estimates of potential employment, potential capital, and total factor
productivity (TFP). As a first step, TFP is derived as a residual of the following two-factor
Cobb Douglas production function fitted to time series of the capital stock and labor inputs:

where Y is output, WAP is the working age population, LFPR is the labor participation rate,
u is the unemployment rate, HRS is the average hours worked per worker, K is the capital
stock, and α is the average labor share over the sample period. TFP, denoted by ε, is derived
as the residual of this equation.
13.
The decline in output during the
recent crisis was largely driven by a
contraction in hours worked and total factor
productivity, as illustrated in the growth
decomposition below. The decline in
productivity and hours worked were
unprecedented in recent history. Contrary
to the experience during the early-1990s
crisis, employment and the labor force
participation rate played a moderate role in

output’s decline. This reflected labor hoarding on the part of firms, labor market reforms in
recent years and the aggressive use of active labor market policies during the crisis to prevent
unemployed workers from leaving the labor force.
14.
The key question is whether TFP
will return to its pre-crisis growth trend. The
Riksbank argues that it will not, on the basis
that the pre-crisis increase in TFP was
driven by cyclical factors, including one-off
improvements in technology related to the
“dot-com” bubble in the early 2000s.
Accordingly, the decline in TFP starting
in 2005–06 is part of a non-cyclical secular
trend, and growth rates are unlikely to
resume their pre-crisis averages.

15.
Potential output and the output gap are then estimated by extracting cyclical factors
from TFP and factor inputs. Trend TFP, and equilibrium values of the other labor input
variable (the labor force participation rate, unemployment rate, total hours worked) are
derived on the basis of filtering techniques. We estimate the equilibrium values using both
HP and Kalman filters, and correct for end-point bias by including projections to the series to
be filtered4. Adjustments are made for capacity utilization.5
16.
The resulting negative output gap estimate, including both TFP and adjusted TFP
measures of the gap, is larger than estimates based on the other univariate approaches
discussed above. The gap is estimated to have troughed at negative 5–6 percent in 2009 and
recovered to negative 3–3½ percent in 2010. As discussed earlier, the estimates derived on
the basis of HP-filtering tend to show a larger negative gap during the downturn, and a
smaller negative gap during the recovery. Moreover, the adjusted TFP measures of the output
gap point to a slightly larger (negative) output gap than the TFP measure.

4

Two sets of projections for the inputs are generated: (i) by extrapolating the data series on the basis of constant
growth rates; and (ii) by assuming a decline in growth rates. Output projections are based on staff’s central case
scenario in the macro economic framework.

17.
Nonetheless, this approach for measuring the output gap entails some potential bias.
For example, labor hoarding, which partly explains the behavior of unemployment during the
crisis, would cause adjusted TFP to be underestimated. Correspondingly, potential output and
the size of the (negative) output gap would also be underestimated. Another source of bias is
the manufacturing sector capacity utilization rate. If the capacity utilization rate of the
nonmanufacturing sector is less volatile than that of the manufacturing sector―for example,
the retail sector might find it more difficult to adjust store hours when demand
declines―adjusted TFP would be overestimated. HP-filtered series would thus overestimate
trend TFP, possibly resulting in overestimation of the size of the output gap.
C. Multivariate Modeling Approach
18.
The multivariate filtering (MV) approach for estimating potential output and the
output gap incorporates relevant empirical relationships between actual and potential output,
unemployment, core inflation and capacity utilization in manufacturing within the framework
of a small macroeconomic model. This approach allows the estimated growth of potential
output to vary with an array of recent information—inflation, unemployment and capacity
utilization—while at the same time taking into account the more stable trends evident in
long-term series. The estimation is done by regularized maximum likelihood, allowing prior
distributions to be defined where possible, and the “data to speak” where relevant. The model
is applied to quarterly data for Sweden from 1996Q2–2010Q4. This sample period is dictated
by the availability of data.

49
19.
The results depend on well-chosen priors. The most important of these are the
parameter governing how fast potential growth returns to steady state following shocks, and
the relative frequencies of demand and supply shocks. A given change in actual GDP may
reflect a fluctuation of actual GDP around a stable potential GDP path—that is, reflecting a
demand shock—or a change in potential GDP—that is, reflecting a supply shock. The
interpretation of observed fluctuations in GDP in terms of the underlying shocks clearly has
strong implications for the resulting view of potential GDP. In particular, the prior values one
assigns on the relative variance of demand and supply shocks have a large impact on the
estimates of potential output resulting from the crisis.
20.
Staff’s prior is that demand shocks 10

Yet, there is reason to believe that potential output growth has fluctuated
during 2008–10. In particular, fixed investment fell by record proportions while
unemployment remains above pre-crisis averages. While the fall in fixed investment is
viewed as temporary, its recovery will take time. Similarly, ongoing labor market reforms are
expected to continue bringing the unemployment rate down in coming years. Hence, the
parameter governing how fast potential output returns to steady state—which ranges from 0.1
(fast) to 1 (slow)—is set at a moderate 0.4, reflecting some hysteresis effects of the recession.

We consider two main scenarios. First, the authorities’ labor market reforms succeed
in lowering equilibrium unemployment down to 5 percent. Alternatively, we consider a “no
policy” scenario in which the equilibrium unemployment rate remains at 6 percent.
23.
Results from the multivariate filter model are summarized in the appendix figures.
They suggest marginal differences in the output gap between the two scenarios, indicating
the following:


Output gap and inflation. The estimated output gap dropped sharply during
the 2008–09 recession to a trough of about minus 7 percent in 2009Q3, but
by 2010Q4, it had swung back up to a central estimate of minus 2 percent. Inflation
broadly evolved as expected given the estimated output gap. Core inflation declined
during two distinct periods (2003Q1–2004Q3; and 2008Q4–2010Q4), dipping below
the 2 percent target.

The MV filter estimates show a slight
increase in the NAIRU from
2002–06, followed by a slight decline

main scenario—perhaps reflecting
lagged labor-market effects of the
steep increase in actual
unemployment in 2008–09). Also given the high labor share of income, 67 percent,
the persistent unemployment gap is interpreted as a decline in potential output. In the
alternative scenario, where steady state unemployment is 6 percent assuming no
policies, the equilibrium unemployment rate rises by about 1 percentage point.

D. Is There Corroborative Evidence of Rising Equilibrium Unemployment?
24.
Unemployment has lagged the recovery and may have spilled over into the
equilibrium rate. We look at evidence from the Beveridge Curve to verify whether this is
true. The Beveridge curve (BC), depicts a negative relationship between vacancies and
unemployment and serves as a simple representation of how efficient labor markets are in
terms of matching unemployed workers to available job openings in the aggregate economy.
The position of the economy on the curve is an indicator of the state of the labor market—
i.e., a high level of vacancies and a low level of unemployment imply a tight labor market.
An outward shift in the curve can occur as a result of structural shifts in the economy, which
affect the matching efficiency of the labor market.
25.
The outward shift in the Beveridge curve from 2001–07 is puzzling given the wide
ranging labor market reforms during the past decade. In particular, tax reductions as well as
reform of the unemployment insurance and sick leave benefits system, together with
increased coordination of wage formation should have lowered equilibrium unemployment in
recent years by increasing the labor force participation rate. Hence, an inward shift would be
more intuitive. One explanation, for the counter-intuitive outward shift could be that recent
reforms have temporarily increased matching problems by introducing into the labor supply
lower skilled workers (coming out of the sickness benefits system) who have been absent
from the work force for a long period of time and lack the requisite skills for the current
economy. A further possibility is cyclical—that the position of the curve shifts out during
upswings, as followed the dot.com crash (Pissarides).

Vacancy rate (percent of unemployed)

As expected, and borne out by historical evidence, there were movements along the
Beveridge Curve (January 2007 to January 2009), as the Swedish economy entered the recent
recession. Unemployment rose sharply

E. Conclusions
27.
The empirical approaches considered in this attachment consistently point to a
negative output gap in 2010–11, but they differ on the extent of economic slack. The three
standard methodologies used in the analysis suggest that there continued to be significant
spare capacity in the Swedish economy at end-2010. Specifically, the output gap in 2010 is
estimated to have been within the range of negative 2½ –3½ percent. The relative width of
the range reflects the degree of uncertainty about the effect of the financial crisis on potential
output growth. Moreover, the methodologies differ on the speed of adjustment since end2010, suggesting the output gap is within the range of negative ½–2 percent in 2011. Lastly,
the model based multivariate filter suggests there has been an increase in the equilibrium rate
of unemployment, with the cyclical unemployment spilling over into the underlying rate of
unemployment—and this increase is in the range of ½ to 1 percent depending on the extent to
which ongoing labor market reforms are effective.

Univariate Filters
Hp filter
The HP filter calculates potential output by minimizing both the fluctuations of the cycle and
the trend, subject to a restriction on the variation of potential output. The restriction, lambda,
determines to what extent variability in the trend relative to the cycle is allowed for. A higher
lambda indicates a larger importance of cyclical shocks and yields a smoother trend/potential
output. The standard values for lambda, for an advanced economy like Sweden’s, are 1600
and 100 for quarterly and annual data, respectively6.
Christiano-Fitzgerald Filter
Band pass filters like the CF are designed to eliminate high and low frequency movements in
the data using a two-sided symmetric moving average. The CF is non-stationary, asymmetric
and depends on the time series properties of the underlying data. Despite its also remaining
prone to end-point bias, its revision properties are slightly better than the HP. Swedish GDP
is integrated with an order of 1, so the band pass filter is estimated on a stationary GDP
series.
Kalman Filter
We estimate an unobserved components model based on a simple Kalman filter. The model
assumes two specifications: output follows an AR1 process and an ARMA process, while
potential output is modeled as a random walk with drift. This approach suggests a larger
output gap than the HP filter. One possible explanation for this lies in the fact that to a
greater extent than the HP filter, the Kalman model assumes the growth rate of potential GDP
has not been constant over time. Because the Kalman model treats the growth rate of
potential output as time varying, it is better able to extract cyclical fluctuations from the data.

6

Standard values of lambda have been calibrated based on the US economy.

55
Production Function Approach
The main empirical problem with equation (1) described earlier, is that any results are
potentially biased, given that capital and labor utilization are unobserved. Without
controlling for the intensity of resource utilization, the TFP residual is likely polluted by
these changes. As illustrated in the growth decomposition chart above, output fluctuations
have historically been driven to a great extent by changes in productivity. This is partly due
to the fact that the capital input to production, essentially relies on the total capital stock, not
the flow of services actually provided by this stock at any given point in time.
One solution to this potential bias is to control for factor utilization by adjusting the capital
stock to better reflect the intensity of its use in the production process. This is done by using
capacity utilization to derive a proxy for the flow of capital services. Labor utilization is
assumed to be constant.
The original production function equation is adjusted as follows and fitted to the data to
derive capacity utilization rate-adjusted TFP (adjusted TFP):
ln

. ln

ln

(2)

where cu is the capacity utilization rate and ε is adjusted TFP.
Adjusted TFP falls less than TFP during 2008–09 (text chart). The text chart shows TFP and
adjusted TFP derived from fitting the two equations above. Since fluctuations of both labor
inputs and capacity utilization rates have been controlled for in the adjusted TFP series, the
decline likely reflects factors whose effects are lasting even when adjusted TFP resumes its
trend growth. These factors could include, among others, a higher cost of capital during the
global financial crisis, and a permanent shift of demand away from sectors that enjoyed high
productivity growth, for instance manufacturing7. There is some evidence of a resource shift
away from the tradable to the non-tradable sector. As expected, the manufacturing sector
suffered the bulk of job losses during the crisis—and, data show that employment during the
recovery has been equally uneven at the expense of the manufacturing sector.

7

The recovery in employment and investment has been uneven, with the manufacturing sector in particular, lagging.

The components (figure) suggest a decline in potential output growth during
2008–09, and a slight increase in 2010. After rising by 0.9 percent per year on average
during 2000–08, the equilibrium labor participation rate declined during the recession,
though not nearly to the same degree as during the 1990s.
29.
Equilibrium hours worked per employee fell during the recession. Given the sharp
decline in measured hours worked, the Kalman filter in particular—which allows for
fluctuations in the trend variable—shows a larger decline in equilibrium hours as well. By
construction, adjusted TFP should not be affected by cyclical factors—a smoothed adjusted
TFP series should be a good representation of trend TFP for potential output.

Multivariate Model
The model, detailed in Benes et. al., (2010) is built around three gaps—the output gap,
unemployment gap and capacity utilization gap—and three identifying equations as follows:
An inflation equation relating core inflation with the level (yt) and the change (yt – yt-1) in the
output gap takes the form:
4

4

.

(1)

Based on Okun’s law defining the relationship between the unemployment rate and the
output gap, a dynamic unemployment equation links the unemployment gap to the output
gap, also taking into account the lagged effect of changes in output on unemployment:
.

(2)

The model assumes there is important information in capacity utilization to improve the
estimates of potential output and the output gap, and specifies a capacity utilization equation
similar to the Okun law relationship:
.

(3)

Given the three identifying equations, equilibrium variables are assumed to evolve
dynamically as follows. A stochastic process including transitory, level shocks and more
persistent shocks determines the evolution of equilibrium unemployment ( ), with the
NAIRU equation specified as follows:
.
with persistent shocks to the NAIRU (

Maximum likelihood estimation is infeasible, given the many unidentified parameters hence
the full model is estimated using a regularized maximum likelihood. This method can be
interpreted as a simple Bayesian technique requiring the user to define prior distributions of
the parameters. While this can improve the estimation procedure by preventing parameters
from wandering into nonsensical territory, the choice of priors also has a non-negligible
impact on the resulting final estimates given that the data are uninformative about certain
parameters.
In addition to the prior distributions of the parameters, values for the labor share θ, steady
state unemployment
and potential GDP
growth rates need to be provided and were
set at 0.63; 5.1 and 6 percent (in a policy and alternative scenario); and 2½ percent,
respectively. While these steady state values matter conceptually given that the endogenous
estimates converge to these exogenously given values in the long term, from a practical point
of view the dynamics over the time horizon of interest are relatively little affected by the
choice of steady state values.

ATTACHMENT II—THE SWEDISH SOVEREIGN1
1.
Markets and the Swedish Fiscal Policy Council (FPC) are confident of the strength of
the Swedish Sovereign.2 Are they correct? This attachment assesses this by using a
comprehensive framework.3 It concludes that while all conventional indicators flash green,
contingent liabilities in the financial sector will need to be contained and carefully monitored
to maintain this strength.
A. The Baseline
2.
This part of the assessment is based on indicators of solvency risks, current deficit
and debt levels, and projected growth-adjusted interest rate on public debt. Indicators of
long-term budget pressures associated with demographics, such as projected changes in
health care and pension expenditures and risks to fiscal sustainability stemming from
sovereign asset and liability composition and financing requirements are considered
alongside.4
3.
The indicators for Sweden are compared with group averages for advanced
economies and European countries. These are also assessed against thresholds that, when
exceeded, indicates a higher risk of fiscal stress as estimated in Baldacci et. al., (2011b). See
Appendix I for a detailed description of all variables, their respective stress thresholds and
their signaling power.
4.
For advanced countries, fiscal risks currently remain elevated and well above
pre-crisis levels (Figure 1). Of particular concern are the high solvency risks related to fiscal
fundamentals and aging related long-term budget pressures, as well as record-high budget
financing needs. Advanced and European countries currently exceed the thresholds on public
debt, the cyclically adjusted primary balance, gross financing needs and long-term health
spending.
5.
In the case of Sweden, the fiscal indicators showed a marked deterioration in the
early 1990s as a result of the Nordic banking and economic crisis. The deterioration of the
fiscal position was faster than anticipated and only partially related to cyclical factors. The
authorities pursued fiscal policies to support activity and employment beyond providing
significant budget support to banks. The increase in unemployment was large and persistent
and so the overall fiscal balance deteriorated significantly (16 percentage points of GDP over

1990–93) with only half of the deterioration attributed to cyclical factors.5 Although Sweden
started the crisis with low debt and fiscal deficits, the situation deteriorated rapidly to the
point where the focus of attention shifted from counter-cyclical fiscal policies to fiscal
sustainability.
6.
This is confirmed by the fiscal indicators in Figure 1. Gross public debt was above the
threshold until the late 1990s and the cyclically adjusted primary balance reached -8 percent
of GDP by 1993, generating very large financing needs during that period. On the other hand,
long-term fiscal pressures at the time did not seem to be particularly worrisome emphasizing
the fact that in its fiscal dimension, following corrective measures, the early 1990s crisis was
a liquidity rather than a solvency crisis.
7.
In the more recent global crisis, Sweden’s experience was radically different from
advanced countries. In contrast to the deterioration in the fiscal stance and public debt
elsewhere, the cyclically adjusted primary balance did not deteriorate, financing needs
remain low and public debt increased marginally in 2009 returning to a negative trend
in 2010. Thanks to the welfare and pension reform of the past two decades, Sweden has also
addressed some of the long-term fiscal pressures. In all long-term indicators Sweden does
better than all group averages and the median, particularly in health spending and fertility
rate (Table 1).
8.
Sweden currently is only on the wrong side of two thresholds, short-term debt
as percent of total debt, around 20 percent; and the fertility rate, 1.9 children per woman.
Given the low overall level of public debt and low financing needs, the share of short-term
debt in Sweden, around 20 percent of total debt in line with group averages, does not
represent a fiscal risk. On the other hand, the fertility rate in Sweden, although below the
stress threshold is among the highest in Europe. Furthermore, both thresholds have relatively
low signaling power of fiscal distress. On the other hand, it ranks very well in all other
dimensions.
B. The Structural Fiscal Balance
9.
Sweden’s underlying fiscal strength is also underscored by its strong structural fiscal
balance. However, the balance is not straightforward to measure notably regarding the
methodology used to estimate the cyclical component of fiscal policy as well as the measure
of potential activity.
10.
During the recent economic crisis, labor market performance in Sweden was stronger
than anticipated. This resulted in an employment gap that was smaller and less volatile than
the output gap. Thus, by only using the output gap to make cyclical adjustments, the
5

63
underlying structural fiscal position is over estimated. Similarly, failing to account for
temporary stimulus measures taken during the recent crisis, the structural fiscal position
would be under estimated. Stimulus measures amounted to 0.1 and 0.6 percent of GDP
in 2009 and 2010 respectively.
11.
The various estimates of the cyclically adjusted and structural balances using the two
gaps are presented in text table 1. Given the appropriate base (employment or output gap) the
approach followed here to adjust for the cycle follows the OECD in distinguishing four
different types of revenues—corporate and personal income tax, social security contributions
and indirect taxes— and household transfers on the spending side. These adjustments are
done using the elasticities estimated by the OECD (2005).
12.
The range of estimates of the underlying fiscal position obtained from the different
methodologies widens in 2009 (with a range from 1.8 to 3.1 percent of GDP) as a result of
the divergence between the employment and output gaps. As expected, the failure to account
for a better-than-expected performance in the labor market overestimates the underlying
fiscal stance whereas the opposite is true if crisis-related stimulus measures are considered
permanent rather than transitory.

13.
Thus, the staff preferred measure of the fiscal stance––the last in the list is the text
table 1––uses the employment gap to account for the cyclical impact of personal income tax,
social security contributions, consumption related taxes and transfers. All other fiscal
variables in the staff preferred measure are adjusted using the output gap. All cyclical
adjustments are made on a disaggregated basis.
14.
The structural balance in Sweden has been at or exceeded the target of 1 percent of
GDP over the cycle, even during the crisis. Therefore, while the recent economic crisis
deteriorated the overall fiscal position more than 3 percentage points of GDP in 2009, mostly
through automatic stabilizers, it has not had an impact on the underlying structural fiscal
position, which has remained strong.

C. Shocks Affecting The Baseline
15.
Three kinds of shocks are considered: macroeconomic assumptions, contingent
liabilities of the government, and the possibility that policies deviate from those underlying
the baseline.
16.
Macroeconomic assumptions. While the external environment has improved
recently, Sweden’s exports depend critically on global demand for consumer durables,
capital goods and inventories. In this connection, given the impact of the global and Euro
area crisis on the prospects of its key U.S. and European export markets, Sweden’s growth
outlook is increasingly dependent on its ability to penetrate further export rising emerging
markets. Thus, even though fiscal risk factors have been improving, significant
macroeconomic risks remain. In particular, on the external side, higher oil prices could result
in lower global growth, and, more importantly, continued strains in euro area periphery’s
sovereigns and banking systems, including potential spillovers to the core, could translate
into significantly lower growth in Europe and the rest of the world.
17.
Thus, while the broader global outlook is slightly improved since the fall 2010 WEO,
the central projection for world growth in 2011–12 is roughly unchanged (the 90 percent
confidence interval around these global projections has narrowed, see table 3). Lower growth
would result in a deterioration of the overall fiscal position.
18.
However, the long-term fiscal impact of a negative growth shock will ultimately
depend on the nature of the shock. If the shock is transitory, automatic stabilizers will
activate, the fiscal position deteriorate transitorily, and public debt increase somewhat but the
underlying structural fiscal position would not deteriorate. On the other hand, if the shock has
a permanent component (which is likely if strains in euro area periphery are fully realized),
then the underlying fiscal position will deteriorate and the projected solid fiscal position over
the medium-term will be reduced. In these circumstances, any structural fiscal reform
(particularly on the revenue side) should be postponed until the new structural fiscal position
is determined with a reasonable degree of certainty.

Challenges to the strength of the Sovereign can also come from various other parts of the
fiscal system—guarantees, local governments, and PPPs. These are considered next.
19.
Contingent liabilities. The National Debt Office is responsible to produce an annual
report analyzing the risk for the State from its portfolio of formal and explicit loans and
guarantees. The analysis covers medium- and long-term concerns about the potential losses
for the state and short-term liquidity risks, that is, the size of the payments that may be
necessary in very negative scenarios.
20.
A more comprehensive analysis of fiscal risks would include contingent liabilities
resulting also from the financial system, public-private partnerships and local governments.
21.
The importance of local governments in the provision of basic services including
social services, education, and health, means that they can be a source of fiscal risks. As
of 2006, total borrowing by local governments amounted to SEK 350 billion or 10 percent of
GDP with almost two thirds corresponding to companies owned by local governments.
Although local governments decide independently and without scrutiny by the State on their
borrowing level and structure, the majority has established limits on foreign currency
denominated debt. However, borrowing limits are indirectly established in that debt servicing
costs are included in the balanced budget requirement for local governments. The local
government funding agency, Kommuninvest i Sverige AB comprising 83 percent of
municipalities and with SEK 123.6 billion of outstanding credit in 2009, has top credit
ratings reflecting the creditworthiness of the Swedish local government sector.6 Rating
agencies highlight the excellent quality of its assets and loan exposures.

See Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s 2010 credit analysis on Kommuninvest i Sverige AB.

66
22.
Although there is significant local self-government, including unrestricted taxation
rights at the municipal level, and no explicit guarantee exists, the Swedish state has the
ultimate responsibility for the sector overall. In this connection and to reduce the fiscal risks,
strong financial requirements are placed on local governments. These include the
requirement to, at least, run balanced budgets, and practice sound economic management.
Local government’s annual reports are required to produce an assessment on how these
objectives are met. Finally, the government follows closely economic developments in local
governments which are discussed in the Spring Policy Bill and Budget Bill.
23.
The more frequent use of some form of public-private partnership (PPP) to
implement infrastructure projects represents also a source of potentially significant
contingent, explicit or implicit, liabilities. Although interest in different forms of PPPs is
growing in Sweden, particularly for railways and roads, so far implementation has been
limited, resulting in relatively small contingent liabilities at the moment. Until recently the
only PPP project in Sweden consisted of the Arlandabanan railway connecting downtown
Stockholm and Arlanda airport in the late 1990s with a cost of around SEK 4.5 billion. In this
case, the infrastructure was built and is operated by a private partner which gets reimbursed
through ticket proceeds. More recently, at the end of 2010, the new Karolinska Teaching
hospital project in Stockholm was approved. It is the largest hospital project built with PPP
funding amounting to more than SEK 13 billion.
24.
In the 2007 Budget Bill the government established a commission to study the legal,
financial, and technical prerequisites for PPPs in the road and rail sectors. The commission
provided recommendations on a Swedish specific PPP model and the appropriate legal
framework. It also produced a list of suitable investment projects that could be implemented
over the next few years. Thus, the importance of PPP projects appears to be increasing in
Sweden and thus their associated contingent liabilities. To manage and reduce the associated
risks it will be important to (i) integrate PPP projects with the government’s investment
strategy and it’s medium-term fiscal framework; (ii) ensure a robust legal framework; (iii)
establish a clear allocation of responsibilities within the government to deal with PPPs
including oversight, and risk assessment; and (iv) ensure that the Ministry of Finance is
empowered to stop or suspend PPP projects under certain conditions, and has the right of
final approval before contract signature. The fiscal impact of PPP projects, including
contingent liabilities should be transparently discussed in budget documents and integrated in
debt sustainability analysis.
25.
Fiscal strength can also be undermined by change in fiscal policy. In Sweden, this
risk has been contained by cross party support for the fiscal framework. The fiscal
framework grew out of experience from the economic and financial crisis in the 1990s and
has three key elements: (i) an unlegislated surplus target established at 1 percent of GDP over
the business cycle; (ii) a rolling central government expenditure ceiling established for three
years ahead, with a new “third year ceiling added each year, and (iii) a balanced budget
requirement for local governments. In implementing this, the Riksdag sets first the total

67
expenditure allocations. Appropriations within that ceiling are determined separately and
later. The 2011 budget added a year to the horizon for the expenditure ceiling, extending it
from three to four years ahead.
26.
The fiscal framework has proven effective in ensuring predictable and sustainable
government finances and a strong net wealth and fiscal positions. Furthermore, the credibility
of the framework has been significantly enhanced during the recent crisis when, without
deviating from it, the government was able to provide adequately counter-cyclical fiscal
policies. A key element of the fiscal framework is the FPC. The Council has proven to be an
effective watchdog of fiscal performance providing more credibility to fiscal policy
formulation and implementation. A narrower mandate focusing on the short-term fiscal
stance as well as long-term sustainability would enhance its effectiveness. Thus, the strong
fiscal framework currently in place reduces significantly the risk of fiscal policy shocks.
27.
The current fiscal stance, consistent with that presented in the 2011 Spring Bill,
significantly over-performs relative to the fiscal framework requirements, particularly
regarding the 1 percent of GDP surplus target. This reflects cyclical improvements from the
strong recovery as well as the impact of recent reforms to reduce welfare expenditures and
combined with moderate long-term age related spending results in positive long-term fiscal
sustainability and net worth projections (text table 4 and Tables 5 & 6). Given the strongerthan-expected fiscal position during the cyclical downturn in 2009–10, public debt to GDP
ratio increased in 2009 by 4 percentage points of GDP to 43 percent of GDP and will
gradually fall to around 20 percent of GDP in 2015.
28.
Under several alternative
scenarios (Figure 2), including a
permanent ½ standard-deviation
shock to growth, interest rate and
primary balance independently
and a ¼ standard deviation shock
to the three combined, a onetime 30 percent depreciation of
the REER, and a one-time
10 percent of GDP shock to
contingent liabilities, public debt
trajectory remains negative and
the increase in the level of debt is
moderate in all cases (under the
worst case scenario, gross debt
would reach 35 percent of GDP
in 2015).

The likelihood of a fiscal crisis not only depends on variables that directly affect the
public sector balance sheet but also on the overall condition of the economy, including the
availability of overall savings. There is some evidence to support that countries facing ‘twin’
deficits are more likely to suffer speculative attacks, which could also lead to a liquidity
crisis for the government.
30.
These risks appear moderate in Sweden; except for small fiscal deficits in 2009
and 2010, the current account and fiscal positions are projected to be in surplus over the
medium-term.

Last, challenges to the strength of the sovereign can come from implicit contingent
liabilities in particular from the financial sector. In Sweden this risk is significant. The risk is
magnified by the large level of private debt. At 280 percent of GDP it is one of the highest in
the world (third highest in the group of countries shown in text figure) and comparable to
countries like Ireland, Portugal, the United Kingdom and Spain.
32.
The financial system in Sweden is large, above 500 percent of GDP, concentrated
four major banks hold 65 percent of the market share and has extensive cross-border
operations and non-banking activities with substantial reliance on wholesale funding
markets. Thus, it represents a significant contingent fiscal risk.
33.
However, its resilience has strengthened considerably after the crisis (major banks
have raised capital to well above regulatory requirements, their exposure to peripheral
European economies is small, and their loan losses in the Baltics have fallen).
34.
Three risks remain; Euro area tail risks, housing market, and the size of the financial
system. The assessment of the recent FSAP is that, based on two of these three risks, the
financial system in Sweden is generally sound. This credit assessment is not predicated on
Euro area tail risks but on adverse macroeconomic scenario (prolonged low growth and a
domestic housing market crash).
35.
Estimates of the net direct support to the financial system provided by the countries
most affected by the recent crisis are presented in text chart 1 together with similar estimates

69
for the Nordic countries during the crisis in the 90s.7 The cost of direct support varies
enormously across countries but takes no account of the short- or long-term output and
employment costs incurred. It can be very significant, almost 30 percent of GDP in the case
of Ireland.

(making them even stronger), further
developing the macro-prudential framework and adequately funding prudential supervision,
is critical to preserve Sweden’s strong fiscal position and long-run fiscal sustainability.

D. Capacity to React to Realized Fiscal Risks8
37.
The last element in assessing the strength of the sovereign concerns the ability of the
political and social system to adjust policies as needed if large fiscal shocks materialize.
Ostry et. al., (2010) look at this question by defining a ‘debt limit’ that is consistent with the
country’s historical track record of adjustment. They determined a threshold above which
fiscal efforts to maintain fiscal sustainability have to exceed the country’s fiscal response to
rising debt observed in the past. Table 3 presents results from Ostry et. al., (2010) for two
interest rate assumptions, one where the market rate reflects the perceived probability of
default and the other taking into account the rising risk of default as debt approaches its limit.
Long-term public debt levels to which the economy converges if debt never exceeds the debt
limit are also reported.
38.
Although subject to uncertainty, the estimated fiscal space, abstracting from shortterm liquidity risks, is large in general, 60 percent of GDP on average (80 percent for
European countries). In the case of Sweden, the space is almost three times as large (more
than twice relative to European countries) at 170 percent of GDP. This is largely the result of
a low initial level of public debt, projected by end-2015 to be 38 percent of GDP. Only
Australia, Korea and New Zealand are projected to have lower debt levels. On average, their
7

The net fiscal cost is defined as total outlays net of recovery by end-June 2010. As further recovery will be
possible by divesting assets that the government still holds, the net fiscal cost is an upper bound of the expected
net loss of financial sector support. For more details see IMF (2010).

sample of countries is projected to have a debt level in excess of 110 percent of GDP
(93 percent of GDP in the case of European economies). This implies that Sweden has a
large capacity to deal with extraordinary shocks. However, the feasibility to use the whole
buffer critically depends on short-term liquidity considerations not triggering a rollover
crisis. Indeed, the 2008–10 financial crisis highlights the need to create large fiscal space in
order for advanced economies to absorb potential extraordinary shocks.
E. Conclusion
39.
Sweden fiscal risks appear moderate and the fiscal buffers to deal with these risks
adequate. Basic fiscal variables, long-term fiscal indicators, sovereign asset and liability
composition and financing requirements indicate that the probability of fiscal distress is
small. In contrast, in advanced countries fiscal risks remain elevated and well above precrisis levels. A robust and credible fiscal framework provides predictability and transparency
to fiscal policies reducing volatility and risks. The key task is to ensure that potential risks
from the financial sector are contained.
40.
These financial sector risks could be aggravated by euro area tail risks and high
domestic private debt. If peripheral European economies risks materialize, they could have a
significant negative impact in Sweden that, unlike the recent economic downturn, will be
more persistent. The associated fiscal risks and contingent liabilities should be reduced by
continued progress to build fiscal buffers, and by aggressive implementation of steps to
strengthen macro prudential and regulatory institutions and policies.

Appendix I
As introduced in the Fiscal Monitor (IMF 2010, 2011) and Cottarelli (2011), the risk
framework followed here is based on a comprehensive view of all factors that affect the
probability that the move of certain fiscal indicators into dangerous territory, or other shocks,
could trigger a negative market response. These indicators can be grouped into (i) basic fiscal
variables; (ii) long-term fiscal indicators; and (iii) asset and liability management indicators.
The choice of indicators identified in Baldacci et. al., (2011a) measures fiscal
sustainability risks under the medium-term scenario of the World Economic Outlook baseline
projections. These indicators measure solvency risks based on current deficit and debt levels,
and projected growth-adjusted interest rate on public debt. Indicators of long-term budget
pressures associated with demographic aging, such as projected change in health care and
pension expenditures, are also included. In addition to the solvency risk outlook, the
framework also covers risks to fiscal sustainability stemming from sovereign asset and
liability composition and financing requirements.
The choice of indicators is subject to operational constraints and avoids using
financial market indicators. These indicators already incorporate an assessment of risk to the
baseline (including both rollover risks and risks from potential shocks to the baseline), they
also incorporate the perceived probability of government’s accessing non-market financing to
avoid insolvency and they tend to lag rather than lead the deterioration in fiscal
fundamentals.
The indicators are presented against a threshold that, when exceeded, indicates a
higher risk of fiscal stress. This is defined as a crisis episode that encompasses public debt
default as well as near-default events and severe deterioration in solvency risk outlook. The
thresholds are estimated in Baldacci et. al., (2011b) on the basis of a univariate procedure
that maximizes the likelihood of predicting a fiscal crisis. Each of the nine variables used has
different predicted power defined as one minus the total error and it is a measure of the
statistical power of the variable. Table 1 lists all the variables, their respective thresholds and
their signaling power in an index form so that the total sum is 100.

ATTACHMENT III—RESERVE ADEQUACY1
A. Lessons From the Global Crisis
1.
Pre-crisis, the Swedish authorities, like others in advanced countries, assumed that
there was little rationale for holding precautionary foreign exchange reserves, because they
would have access to markets even under adverse conditions. However, the crisis experience
revealed the need to rethink foreign exchange reserve adequacy.
2.
The global financial crisis severely affected the Swedish banking system. Swedish
banks, similar to other large European banks, relied substantially on wholesale dollar and
euro funding, by issuing commercial paper, covered bonds, and other debt instruments, and
used the foreign exchange swap market extensively. After the collapse of Lehman Brothers
in September 2008, with increased counterparty risks, funding and currency swap markets
were impaired, and Swedish banks faced constraints in funding and hedging.
3.
In response, the Riksbank introduced a US dollar lending facility to ease liquidity
strains. And to finance this, the authorities boosted foreign exchange reserves in mid-crisis.
The Riksbank arranged reciprocal swap facilities with the Federal Reserve, while National
Debt Office (NDO) borrowed externally SEK 100 billion (US$ 15 billion).2 At its peak
(April 2009), the Riksbank’s US dollar lending amounted to $30 billion, most of which was
financed by the swap. If the swap had not been in place, the total amount of the US dollar
lending would have exceeded the stock of foreign exchange reserves at that time
($28 billion).

Prepared by Kotaro Ishi (EUR).

In Sweden, the statutory responsibility of international reserve management is defined as following. Sveriges
Riksbank Act (Riksbank Act) mandates the Riksbank to manage international reserves (Chapter 7, Article 2.),
while the Budget Act allows the NDO to borrow externally on behalf of the Riksbank.

80
4.
This response was effective. By the summer of 2009, strains in funding markets
started easing, and demand for the Riksbank’s dollar lending facility declined. And the
Riksbank terminated the US dollar lending facility at end-2009. Nonetheless, the Riksbank
maintains a high level of foreign exchange reserves.
5.
This crisis experience has reopened the issue of foreign exchange reserve adequacy,
because inadequacy of foreign exchange reserve could have called into question the ability of
the Riksbank to act as an emergency liquidity provider in support of financial system
stability.
B. Traditional Metrics of Reserve Adequacy
6.
There is no consensus on how foreign exchange reserve adequacy be defined. In
many cases, the simple rules of thumb are used. These metrics are: GDP; import cover; broad
money; and short-term external debt.
7.
Sweden fares better than other advanced economies in all these metrics. At end-2010,
Sweden’s foreign exchange reserves amounted to 10 percent of GDP, 18 percent of broad
money, 2 percent of imports of goods and services, and 18 percent of bank short-term debts
(Figure 1). All these exceeded the median of advanced economies (Figure 2).
8.
However, these traditional approaches offer little insight in assessing reserve
adequacy in advanced countries. The GDP metric has little theoretical or empirical
grounding. The import cover metric is also not immediately relevant, given that Sweden is a
large capital account surplus country. With strong institutions and sound macroeconomic
policy framework, the broad money metric also has little traction.
9.
Of the traditional metrics, the debt metric appears to be most useful for advanced
countries, though even its merits are qualified. For emerging markets economies, the
“Greenspan-Guidotti” rule of 100 percent cover of external short-term debt is a widely used
metric. However, full insurance against a sudden withdrawal of bank external short-term
funding would require an impractically high level of foreign exchange reserves in advanced
countries. For example, if the 100 percent rule is applied to bank short-term debts, the
amount of required foreign exchange reserves would be 5.6 times Sweden’s current holding:
i.e., $266 billion (58 percent of GDP), compared to $ 47billion at end-2010. Furthermore, if
all advanced economies were to pursue such a reserve adequacy strategy, there would be
very considerable global over-insurance.
C. A Liquidity Gap Approach
10.
For the Riksbank, important motives for holding foreign exchange reserves include:
providing emergency liquidity assistance to banks, covering Sweden’s share of the
international lending by the IMF, and intervening foreign in exchange markets. However, the
Riksbank’s ability in mid-crisis to serve as lender of last resort in foreign currencies was

81
constrained by the amount of foreign exchange reserves, including the government’s ability
to borrow externally. This establishes a simple intuition. The adequate level of foreign
exchange reserves can be assessed by first, determining the maximum amount of banks’
foreign exchange reserve needs under stress; second, estimating the probability of the stress
events on these banks; and then extending these probability estimates to the joint probability
of bank liquidity needs and the inability of the sovereign to borrow in mid-crisis to fund such
bank liquidity needs.3
Banks’ Foreign Exchange Reserve Needs
11.
Basel III has set new regulatory standards on liquidity. One is the Liquidity Coverage
Ratio (LCR), which will ensure that banks have sufficient high quality liquid assets to
survive a significant stress scenario lasting 30 days. The other is the Net Stable Funding
Ratio (NSFR), which will ensure that long-term assets are funded with stable liabilities and
banks can survive one year under market stress circumstances.4
12.
If the LCR and NSFR are applied in each foreign currency, it would give a
benchmark for assessing the maximum amount of foreign exchange reserve needs. By
definition, the LCR and the NSFR will ensure that banks will survive for 30 days and one
year, respectively, under stress circumstances in foreign exchange funding markets. Thus,
opportunity costs for banks to meet the LCR and the NSFR can be considered as “liquidity
insurance” that banks are required to pay for. If banks face difficulty in meeting these
liquidity standards, even over time, as a policy option, the central bank/the government may
share the liquidity insurance with banks by filling liquidity gaps in each currency. With this
approach, the difference between actual and required liquidity gaps by currency gives an
estimate of the maximum amount of foreign exchange reserves needs.
13.
As an illustration, NSFR estimates are reported below based on the published
information for each of four major Swedish banks. The analysis focuses on banks’ US dollar
assets and liabilities and euro assets and liabilities.


First, examine the structure of major banks’ US dollar and euro balance sheets. On
the US dollar balance sheet, banks rely substantially on debt securities as their main

3

There is a limited literature on reserve adequacy which focuses on advanced economies. Berg (2008)
discussed the application of alternative reserve adequacy models to Swedish data. For general discussions about
reserve adequacy, focusing on emerging market and low income countries, see International Monetary Fund
(2011).
4

The LCR is aimed at promoting the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banks by ensuring that
they have sufficient high quality liquid assets to survive a significant stress scenario lasting 30 days. The LCR is
expected to be met in a single currency and by each currency. The NSFR is aimed at promoting structural
changes in the liquidity risk profiles of banks away from short-term funding mismatches and toward more stable
longer-term funding of assets and business activities (Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, 2010).

82
sources of funding and hold a large amount of non-US dollar assets (e.g. mortgages)
converted through foreign exchange swaps. Detailed information on their maturity
profiles is not available, but anecdotal information suggests that a large portion of the
debt securities are in short-term and non-US dollar assets in longer-term, implying a
maturity mismatch. On the euro balance sheet, banks rely less on debt securities and
more on deposits and equity in funding and hold more securities in their assets. Thus,
the degree of a maturity mismatch in the euro balance sheet could be considered
moderate.

Importantly, it is assumed that in stress, banks will not be able to raise funding in
foreign currencies.5 This could be considered as an extreme stress scenario, but the
global crisis experience suggests that this is not an unlikely scenario. Detailed
assumptions for the factors are summarized in Table 1.
14.
The results suggest substantial funding gaps in the US dollar balance sheet, but not
significant gaps in the euro balance sheet. The US dollar funding gap narrowed somewhat
over the last three years—reflecting banks’ efforts to extend the maturity of their debt
funding—but remains substantial, ranging from $30 billion to $70 billion for the total of four
major banks, depending on the assumptions made on the stability of funds and the liquidness
of assets (Figure 3). The upper estimates significantly exceed the current level of foreign
exchange reserves ($50 billon). By bank, Nordea is estimated to be exposed to large NSFR

gaps, given its extensive operations in Nordic economies. In contrast, the euro funding gap is
estimated to be small or even zero with discount factors assumed in Table 1. This is mainly
because euro-denominated debt securities have longer maturity—anecdotal evidence
suggests that more than a half of euro-denominated debt securities have the maturity of over
one year.
The Probability of Loss of Access by Banks to Foreign Currency Funding
15.
There is no consensus on how to measure the probability of liquidity crisis.6
However, past experiences show that a bank solvency crisis in many cases followed a
liquidity crisis—once investors recognize default risks in a bank, they stop rolling over their
claims on the bank. Accordingly, the analysis below uses the probability of a default by a
bank as a proxy for the probability that a bank is shut out from funding markets.
16.
The probability of a liquidity crisis and its impact would depend on the sources of the
initial shock. The global environment for Swedish banks remains uncertain, and concern
about financial risk in several southern European economies is lingering. Accordingly, solely
for purposes of illustration of the technical approach suggested here, a stress scenario is
considered assuming that a European sovereign, which has experienced market pressures
recently, becomes distressed, which leads to distress in Swedish banks, and Swedish banks
are shut out from funding markets. Because the proxy focuses on solvency crises, it probably
underestimates somewhat the risk of liquidity crises as these can also occur separately from
solvency crises.
17.
The measurement of probability follows Segoviano and Goodhart (2009)’s
methodology.7 Their measurement is based on Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads and
equity prices for the four major Swedish banks, Sweden, and the selected European
sovereign. The distress dependence matrix—which illustrates market perceptions on pairwise conditional probabilities of distress—shows that Swedish banks’ risks with the
European sovereign used in this exercise rose sharply in the spring of 2009, but have since
come down to a lower level (Table 2 and below text figure). The probability that all Swedish
banks become distressed given stress in the European sovereign also reached highs at 0.4 in
mid 2009, but now is low.

6

For example, some literature suggests that a crisis could be self-fulfilling and triggered by “sunspot” variables
(see Jeanne and Rancière, 2006).
7

The probability indicators, which are calculated following Segoviano and Goodhart (2009) based on CDS
spreads, measure the probability of distress of a bank or an economy in interest. However, Thus the assumption
that a liquidity crisis would simultaneously lead to a banking crisis may not be a strong one. Furthermore, it is
assumed that the measurement of the probability of liquidity crisis indicates.

Combining Liquidity Gaps with Probability of Stress Events
18.
The final steps are to trace through the implications ―in this illustrative case― for
the Swedish banking system using a “decision tree” structure.8
19.
In September 2008, given the assumed originating stress event, the probability that
Swedbank faces liquidity risk is estimated at 0.56 (Figure 4, the top figure). Swedbank’s
NSFR gap in US dollar suggests the funding gap of $10 billion.9 This in turn implies that to
prevent Swedbank from a US dollar funding shortage, the central bank needs to hold
$10 billion in foreign exchange reserves to support Swedbank, with the probability of 0.56
(Figure 4).
20.
Then, moving to the next stage of the tree, the probability of both Swedbank and
Nordea becoming distressed is estimated at 0.36. Thus, given their funding gaps of
$33 billion in total, the central bank needs to hold foreign exchange reserves of $33 billion
with the probability of 0.36.
21.
In a similar way, the combinations of NSFR gaps and the probability are calculated
for September 2008, March 2009, March 2010, and March 2011, and are summarized in
Figure 5.

8

This is an illustrative example. A similar exercise could be carried out with other countries, as trigger
countries.

Amount of f oreign exchange needs (in billions of US dollars)
and increased to $50 billion in
March 2009, well beyond the level of foreign exchange reserve holding at that time
($27 billion). In the middle of 2009, the authorities decided to raise foreign exchange
reserves to over $50 billion, which in retrospect, is consistent with the increased foreign
exchange reserve needs suggested by this analysis.
23.
The analysis is next extended to incorporate Sweden’s sovereign risk. The central
bank does not need to hold precautionary foreign exchange reserves in anticipation of
liquidity crisis, provided that it can maintain market access to borrow foreign currencies and
boost foreign exchange reserves any time under any market circumstances. However, once
large banks become distressed, markets may raise concern about the government’s ability to
resolve banking problems, as bank resolution could involve large public finance resources.
Under such circumstances, the government itself could face a large increase in funding costs.
24.
The results of combining bank and sovereign stress are summarized in Figures 4 and
6.10 The results show that taking account of Swedish sovereign risk, the probability of
significant foreign exchange reserve needs is estimated to be low, except in March 2009. At
that time, Sweden’s sovereign itself was affected severely: the probability of Sweden
sovereign distress was 0.1–0.2 for a single bank stress, but rose to 0.3–0.4 if two or three
banks became stressed.

10

The calculation steps are exactly the same as the previous case where Sweden’s sovereign is not taken
account, for example, in September 2008, given Swedbank’s distress, the probability that Sweden sovereign
becomes distressed―the government itself would lose market access distress―was 0.1 (Figure 4). Then,
combining the probability that Swedbank becomes distressed (0.56), the probability that both Swedbank and
Sweden sovereign become distressed is estimated at 0.06 (=0.56×0.1). This in turn implies the central bank
needs to hold $10 billion in foreign exchange reserves to support Swedbank, with the probability of 0.06, taking
account of the risk that the government itself would lose market access.

86
D. Concluding Observations
25.
The analysis above highlights that foreign exchange reserve needs evolve over time.
This reflects the systemic linkage between banks, and between banks and the sovereign.
Sweden’s sovereign strength itself was affected at the height of the severe stress in
March 2009, suggesting that there was risk that the government itself could have been shut
out of funding markets.
26.
This underscores the need for active foreign exchange reserve management using the
formal tools suggested and illustrated here. The analysis suggests that the current level of
foreign exchange reserves ($50 billion) is enough to meet foreign liquidity needs even under
the unlikely event of distress in the European sovereign considered, given that currently
market perceptions about Swedish banks creditworthiness and Sweden sovereign strength are
relatively favorable.
27.
However, all elements of these calculations can evolve quickly: banks’ liquidity
positions can adjust rapidly; and market perceptions about the impact of any particular
foreign stress event could do likewise. Accordingly, the authorities should frequently review
the range of possible external stress events―for example, which country could be a trigger
(as it may not be the particular European sovereign considered here), and how they affect
Sweden directly and indirectly―that they consider in exercises such as this. These may even,
in some circumstances, need to be accompanied by consideration of purely domestic stress
events.
28.
In addition, to ensure the effectiveness of foreign exchange reserve policy, the
governance framework on foreign exchange reserve management policy, should also be
reviewed urgently.

2011 Article IV Consultation: A staff team comprising P. Doyle (head, EUR),
R. Babihuga, K. Ishi (EUR), and Borja Gracia (FAD) visited Stockholm during
May 19—June 1, 2011 to conduct the consultation discussions. Mr. Holmberg,
Advisor to Sweden’s Executive Director, also attended the mission.
Outreach: The team met with the parliamentary finance committee,
representatives of the private sector, the labor union, the manufacturing
association, the four largest banks, think tanks, and the Fiscal Policy Council.
Press conference: The mission held a press conference in the Riksbank after the
concluding meeting.
Publication: The staff report will be published.
Last Article IV Consultation: Discussions for the 2010 Article IV consultation
were held in Stockholm on May 27—June 8, 2010 and the staff report was issued
on July 2010 (IMF Country Report 10/220). The consultation was concluded by
the Executive Board on July 14, 2010.

Technical Assistance: In connection with the 2007 Article IV consultation, LEG
and MCM provided technical assistance on bank resolution frameworks (Aide
Memoire, March 16, 2007). Sweden has made significant progress in addressing
deficiencies in its AML/CFT framework identified by the Financial Action Task
Force (FATF) in 2006. Preventive measures for financial institutions have been
strengthened, including with respect to customer due diligence and the reporting
of suspicious transactions. As a result, in October 2010 the FATF removed
Sweden from its regular follow-up process. Going forward, the AML/CFT
framework could be enhanced by enabling the freezing of all funds in cases of
terrorism financing, and by improving beneficial ownership data on legal persons.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 13, 2011

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Sweden
On July 8, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Sweden.1
Background
Sweden’s recovery from the global recession has been very strong relative to other advanced
countries. In 2010, output rose by 5½ percent, with exports, investment, and consumption all
rising rapidly. Unemployment has come down to 7¾ percent, from its mid-crisis peak of over 9
percent, and core inflation has remained close to target throughout. Financial sector strains
have been contained, bank capital and liquidity have strengthened, and most emergency
stabilization measures have been withdrawn.
The fiscal deficit narrowed to 0.3 percent of GDP in 2010 and while public debt remains at about
40 percent of GDP, it is expected to fall. Alongside, a cautious monetary tightening cycle has
been underway since July 2010, with the Riksbank raising the policy rate by 1¾ percentage
points, together with prudential mortgage regulations to cool housing. Since its trough in mid2009, the krona has appreciated by 20 percent against the euro, but remains competitive.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
Growth momentum has been maintained into 2011 with first quarter GDP rising by 6½ percent
year-on-year. This success reflects the strength of domestic and global stabilization policies.
However, long-term and youth unemployment have lagged in the recovery, and fixed
investment, although rising again, is still below 2006–08 levels relative to output. Furthermore,
there is risk of a decline in house prices in coming years which could have an adverse impact
on growth.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Sweden’s impressive recovery from the global recession,
noting that its economic growth in 2010 was uniquely strong among advanced countries. This
performance reflects decisive domestic policies, underpinned by sound policy frameworks.
Directors welcomed the measured exit from policy stimulus. The increases in the Riksbank
policy rate confirm the commitment to low inflation. The withdrawal of many financial sector
support measures alongside enhanced capital ratios has strengthened the resilience of the
sector. The return to fiscal surpluses has reinforced strong sovereign credentials.
Directors noted that notwithstanding the positive outlook, challenges remain. Youth and longterm unemployment has lagged the recovery, fixed investment has remained below its pre-crisis
level relative to GDP, and despite the recent dip in house prices, they still appear richly valued
in the context of elevated household indebtedness. While the global economic outlook has
improved, risks remain, especially from ongoing stresses in the euro area.
Directors commended the balance that the authorities had secured in their 2011 budget
between supporting activity by maintaining a neutral stance given the remaining output gap, and
continuing to build fiscal buffers against external uncertainties. In this regard, they welcomed
the increased margins relative to spending ceilings and the postponement of planned tax
reductions. Directors agreed that if scope remains for reductions in 2012, the focus should be
on the earned income tax credit to strengthen labor market performance. Directors welcomed
the role that the Fiscal Policy Council is playing as an effective watchdog. Going forward, it will
be important to ensure that the Council remains adequately resourced.
Directors noted that continued moderation in wage settlements would provide a platform to
secure a sustained reduction in unemployment. Along with further structural efforts, they
encouraged adoption of permanent concessionary arrangements for labor market entrants.
Directors considered the anticipated further increases in the Riksbank policy rate to be
appropriate. The authorities should stand ready to respond flexibly to circumstances, raising
rates more rapidly if wage settlements accelerate and delaying somewhat if strong krona
appreciation continues.

3

Directors welcomed the findings of the recent Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP)
update, indicating the initial reassurance on credit risks. In light of the potential vulnerabilities
stemming from house prices, they called for continued supervisory vigilance. The authorities
should be prepared to take further macro prudential measures if significant new financial
stability or consumer risks develop.
Directors welcomed recent measures to strengthen the monitoring of liquidity, as well as plans
for early introduction of strong liquidity regulations taking specific account of risks in foreign
currencies. Given the unique characteristics and risks of the Swedish financial system, Directors
supported the authorities’ intention to go faster and further than Basel III capital regulations.
Directors also endorsed the FSAP recommendations on institutional issues. These include
merging the stability and deposit insurance funds, establishing a special bank resolution regime,
increasing further the Financial Supervisory Agency’s capacity, and improving coordination
among institutions responsible for macro prudential policies.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat

Statement by Benny Andersen, Executive Director for Sweden
and Martin Holmberg, Advisor to Executive Director
July 8, 2011
The Swedish authorities would like to express their appreciation for the comprehensive and
in-depth analysis of the Swedish economy and financial sector conducted during the Article
IV and FSAP missions. Overall, the authorities agree with the main findings of the AIV and
FSSA reports.
Short-term outlook and risks
The authorities broadly share staff’s assessment of the short-term outlook and risks. The
Swedish economy grew by 5.7 percent in 2010, driven by both export and domestic demand.
With the high rate of growth, production volumes have now returned to roughly the same
levels as prior to the financial crisis. The recovery has been relatively quick and the economy
is expected to grow faster than in many other countries in 2011 at around 4.5 percent.
Looking ahead, GDP growth will moderate, and the difference between Swedish and foreign
interest rates will decline. Against that background, the exchange rate is projected to remain
at roughly the same level as now over the coming years.
The recovery, in combination with structural reforms, has contributed to a strong increase in
employment and a decrease in unemployment. Indicators point to continued strong growth in
employment as the demand for labor is increasing in most sectors. The rapid improvement in
the labor market is expected to lead to higher wage increases. The upcoming wage
bargaining rounds are taking place in a much stronger cyclical phase than the previous
rounds. The expectation is that wage formation will function smoothly, as it has done over
the past 10-15 years, and will give rise to reasonable wage increases.
The authorities agree with staff that considerable uncertainties about the outlook remain.
Sweden’s public finances are sound, but unfavorable developments of public finances
elsewhere may result in heightened financial market stress and reduced external demand. The
authorities also agree with staff that house price inflation in Sweden has been noteworthy.
Risks associated with the housing market and household debt are therefore monitored
closely. In this context, the Riksbank recently published an extensive study of the Swedish
housing market. Whether the housing market is overvalued or not is a difficult question, but
the authorities agree with staff’s view that more data needs to be collected.
Fiscal policy and framework
The government broadly agrees with staff’s view of the Swedish fiscal position and the fiscal
policy stance. As they point out, Sweden’s fiscal position is strong which makes it possible to
continue to support output in the short term without jeopardizing long-run sustainability.
Sound public finances are also a corner stone in the work to achieve full employment and
greater welfare.

2
Returning to a surplus in the public finances is a matter of the highest priority and such an
outcome is expected to be achieved already this year. As staff points out, the strong recovery
in the Swedish economy implies a more rapid improvement in public finances than was
foreseen in the Budget Bill in September 2010. The surplus in the public finances is then
expected to gradually rise in the coming years. According to the government’s judgment,
some scope for reform will emerge in 2012, and this will be compatible with a broadly
neutral fiscal stance. Future reform efforts will primarily focus on structurally warranted
measures that will strengthen Sweden’s long-term growth prospects by increasing
employment, decreasing unemployment and improving the functioning of the economy.
However, as staff points out, a number of risks remain which, if realized, may affect public
finances negatively. The reform ambitions presented by the government in the 2011 Spring
Budget Bill are therefore conditional on the presence of a sustainable scope for new
measures. Reforms will only be proposed when it is certain that the surplus target will be
met, and the expenditure ceiling not exceeded. It is important that an uncertain scope for
reform is not committed in advance and that a new assessment is made prior to each new
budget year. The government’s view is that it is more responsible to correct an overshooting
of the surplus target afterwards, than to be forced to make cuts should downside risks
materialize.
The government is also in agreement with staff on the important role played by the Fiscal
Policy Council in assessing policy and compliance with the framework. A review of the
remit of the council was made recently and no significant changes to its mandate or available
resources are expected in the near future.
Monetary policy and framework
The Executive Board of the Riksbank decided on July 5 to raise the repo rate by
0.25 percentage points to 2.0 percent. The published repo rate path shows a gradual
normalization of the repo rate in order to attain the inflation target and keep the real economy
stable. At present there is an unusually large difference between the different measures of
inflation. The internationally comparable HICP measure, which excludes mortgage costs, is
currently at 1.7 percent. While CPI inflation is high, at 3.3 percent in May, as a result of
rising mortgage rates, and is expected to remain high above the inflation target of 2 percent
during 2011, underlying inflation is low. Higher CPI inflation is due to rising mortgage rates,
which is a transitory effect. In periods with large interest rate adjustments, it is thus natural
that greater weight is given to measures of underlying inflation when formulating monetary
policy.
As resource utilization rises and wages increase at a faster rate, inflationary pressures in the
economy are expected to rise gradually over the coming years towards the inflation target of
2 percent. If the currently high CPI inflation rate has a more tangible effect on various
agents’ long-term inflation expectations and on wage formation, monetary policy may need
to be tightened more than in the main scenario. If, on the other hand, the international
economic situation becomes weaker, for example, as a result of the fiscal problems in the
euro area worsening, the repo rate may need to be raised at a slower pace in the period ahead.

The authorities welcome staff’s assessment that the current monetary and exchange rate
regimes have served Sweden well.
Financial sector policy and framework
Financial Stability Assessment
The authorities broadly agree with the overall thrust of staff’s financial stability assessment.
The main risks to financial stability lie in the developments outside of Sweden. The Swedish
banks’ direct exposure to peripheral euro-area countries is small. However, given the banks’
heavy reliance on short-term wholesale funding, in particular in US dollars, the Swedish
banks are vulnerable to market disruptions and liquidity risks. Financial stability could thus
be affected from indirect channels should the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area worsen. A
renewed global recession could also affect bank asset quality given trade dependency and the
external financial sector linkages of the Swedish economy. At the same time, Swedish banks
are currently well capitalized from an international perspective giving them an adequate
cushion should risks materialize. Moreover, the Swedish authorities intend to accelerate the
implementation pace of Basel III capital requirements, and impose higher than minimum
capital requirements on the largest and systemically important banks. The authorities will
also build upon the Swedish experience of early implementation of enhanced liquidity
reporting by ensuring that the new Basel III liquidity standards are implemented in an
adequate, appropriate and proportionate manner. Given the nature of Swedish banks´
exposures and prevailing risks, the authorities are pleased to hear that staff welcomes this
stance.
Macroprudential and Financial Stability Framework
Regarding the suggestion to strengthen coordination mechanisms between various regulatory
agencies by establishing a high-level Systemic Financial Stability Council, the authorities
would like to note that a Committee has been established to look into this issue and will
present recommendations by August 2012. Also, the authorities note that while some aspects
of macroprudential policies are related to crisis management and resolution issues, others are
not. There are also some legal differences in the possibilities to share data between the
different authorities, which need to be resolved. Furthermore, the proposal to include
independent members in a macroprudential body could potentially raise confidentiality
concerns. Considerable thought should therefore be put into the tasks and composition of any
group. Irrespective of an establishment of a macroprudential function the institutional
infrastructure among and the mandates of the involved authorities need to be clarified.
Sectoral Regulation and Supervision
The government intends to take action on a number of recommendations concerning the
resources and legal responsibilities of the Financial Supervisory Authority
(Finansinspektionen, FI). The government shares the opinion of the IMF that FI should have
sufficient resources and legal powers to carry out efficient supervision, not least with respect
to the increasing responsibilities regarding regulation of the financial sector. Therefore, in the
Budget Bill for 2012, the government intends to propose to parliament a substantial increase

4
in FI’s appropriations over a three-year period to strengthen its supervisory and oversight
functions.
In this context, the government would like to underline FI’s independence; owing to the same
provisions that apply to all Swedish authorities, any governmental intervention in specific
cases regarding exercise of authority or application of law is strictly prohibited. However, in
order to further safeguard the independence of FI, its policy documents will be amended with
a provision clearly stating the operational and budgetary independence of the authority. The
government will also propose legislative amendments concerning the issue of licensing of
regulated entities thereby clarifying FI’s sole responsibility in this area.
Regarding the regulation of the banking sector, the Swedish authorities would also like to
make a clarification as regards the possibility to appeal administrative decisions. FI would
always, unless very specific circumstances are at hand, decide that for example a revocation
of a license should have immediate effect. This means that the decision will be applied even
though the decision is subject to appeal. For the decision to be suspended, the credit
institution must in its appeal demand that the court stay the execution of the decision. The
decision is only stayed if the request is granted by the court. Courts do not and should not
grant such requests routinely. Actual cases are rare, but the perception is that in almost all
cases the decision will be applied even if an appeal is lodged.
During several years, considerable effort has been put into developing cross-border
supervision at FI and collaboration in the supervisory colleges. This effort will continue in
line with staff recommendations in the FSSA report.
Regarding the insurance sector, several of the issues raised by staff will be dealt with once
the new regulatory framework for the sector, i.e. Solvency II, is implemented. Sweden is also
participating in ongoing work carried out by IAIS in Internationally Active Insurance
Groups, which will contribute to further develop the supervisory standard. Additionally,
regulation regarding the transfer of policies as well as other life insurance related issues is
currently under national review.
The authorities agree that it is important to further develop not only risk based supervision,
but also the level of baseline supervision. FI is currently reviewing the model for baseline
supervision and the need for further strengthening will be taken into account in the review of
future resources. During the first half of 2011 a pilot review of a number of small insurance
companies has been performed.
Regarding the securities markets, the Swedish authorities broadly agree with staff’s
assessment of compliance with IOSCO principles. As regards independence and resources
our view has been expressed above. In relation to enforcement, FI has carefully considered
the process for enforcement and sanctions. FI has not found it efficient to establish a separate
enforcement department, maintaining the view that adequate provisions and practices are in
place to safeguard the interests and fundamental rights of the addressees of FI's potential
decision. It should also be made clear that even though direct representations are not made,
the addressees are always invited to comment on the findings to be presented to the Board

5
before any decisions on sanctions, thereby offering them corresponding possibilities to argue
their case, in accordance with general administrative law to be applied by all public agencies.
The Swedish authorities welcome the detailed assessments of NASDAQ OMX Derivatives
Markets and of the RIX system made by the IMF. The recommendations are constructive and
the authorities look forward to using them in the supervisory and oversight processes. Work
has already been initiated in response to many of the views expressed.
Regarding staff’s suggestion to ring-fence the operation of NOMX DM in a separate legal
entity, the authorities are of the opinion that it is an open question whether a legal separation
is necessary as risk reduction may be achieved by other means. Such a measure should only
be taken if the benefits in terms of risk reduction outweigh the costs.
The Swedish authorities agree with the assessment of Anti-Money Laundering and AntiTerrorist Financing. Significant resources have been devoted to improving compliance in this
area (including the creation of a dedicated unit at FI), and the framework will be developed
further.
