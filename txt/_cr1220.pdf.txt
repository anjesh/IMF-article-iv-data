STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
December 22, 2011

KEY ISSUES
Algeria continues to record solid growth, but the fiscal position has weakened and
long-term challenges persist. In 2011, a year of global economic uncertainty and
regional sociopolitical instability, nonhydrocarbon growth is projected at 5 percent. To
cope with social demands, the authorities raised expenditure, especially on basic food
support, employment creation, support for SMEs, and higher salaries. High hydrocarbon
prices have improved the current account and the already large international reserves
position. However, the economy remains very dependent on hydrocarbon wealth, and
youth and women unemployment is high, despite a decline in total unemployment.
The substantial expansion in public expenditure, if not moderated, could lead to
strong inflationary pressures and an appreciation of the real exchange rate. Large
increases in real wages and other transfers have not yet translated into higher inflation,
but the authorities should consider tightening monetary policy early to contain
inflationary pressures. An appreciation of the real exchange rate would undermine
competitiveness and economic diversification.
Expenditure expansion could also jeopardize medium-term sustainability and
constrain the fiscal space needed to implement policies to support economic
diversification. Despite high foreign exchange reserves (US$178 billion, equivalent to
three years of imports), current expenditure growth makes Algeria’s budget more
vulnerable to the risk of prolonged lower hydrocarbon revenues. It may also constrain
other types of growth-enhancing expenditure such as capital outlays.
More ambitious structural reforms are necessary to achieve sustainable, inclusive,
and private investment-led growth, and to reduce unemployment. Reforms should
aim at enhancing the business climate, improving competitiveness, increasing financial
sector intermediation, and making the labor market more flexible. Without ambitious
reforms, medium-term growth prospects will become weaker. The good news is that
authorities have adopted new measures to support SMEs and employment.
Focus of the consultation. Discussions centered on the policies needed to support
medium-term fiscal sustainability and prudent macroeconomic management while
promoting diversified economic growth and employment creation.
Exchange rate regime. The exchange rate regime is classified as ―other managed
arrangement.‖ Algeria has accepted the obligations of Article VIII Sections 2(a), 3, and 4.

ALGERIA 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

INTRODUCTION
1.
Algeria has had solid economic
growth during the past decade owing to
increasing oil revenues and generally
prudent macroeconomic policies. The fiscal
and monetary policies adopted since the late
1990s, in the context of increasing
hydrocarbon revenues, ensured a decade of
robust economic growth while creating a solid
financial position with large external reserves,
important budgetary savings in an oil
stabilization fund (i.e., Fonds de regulation de
recettes, FRR), and a substantial reduction in
public and external debt levels.
2.
Nonetheless, Algeria continues to
face important challenges, especially the
need to diversify the economy, reduce
youth and female unemployment, and meet
other social demands. Algeria remains
extremely dependent on its hydrocarbon
wealth. Despite past efforts, 98 percent of
exports and more than two-thirds of
budgetary revenues still come from the

hydrocarbon sector. Moreover, although total
unemployment has declined significantly over
the last decade, important social demands
remain, as illustrated by the wave of violent
unrest in early 2011, including demands for
more jobs for the youth. The slow pace and
scope of structural reforms so far, and a poor
business climate, remain significant barriers to
the diversification of the economy and to the
private investment–led growth that generates
sustainable employment.

ECONOMIC CONTEXT
3.
Algeria’s growth remains relatively
strong, but potential inflationary pressures
are emerging.
Nonhydrocarbon GDP (NHGDP) growth has
remained solid, but overall GDP growth
could slow in 2011. In 2010, GDP growth was
led by an NHGDP growth rate of 6.0 percent,
reflecting strong performance in the sectors
supported by the Public Investment Program
(PIP) (construction and public works, and
services). Oil and gas output fell again (by
2.6 percent) bringing overall growth to

3.3 percent. In 2011, a further decline in the oil
and gas sector, and restraint in PIP
expenditures, could bring overall GDP growth
to about 2.5 percent.
Inflation remains moderate but is rising.
After declining from 5.7 percent in 2009 to
3.5 percent in mid-2011 thanks to subdued
increases in fresh food prices, average inflation
has increased through October 2011 to
4.2 percent. In year-on-year terms, inflation
rose from 2.7 percent in end-2010 to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 3

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

ALGERIA

5.5 percent in October 2011, partly because of
a new surge in fresh food prices.
Banks’ deposit growth accelerated in the
first half of 2011, further increasing bank
liquidity. Civil service pay increases likely
contributed to an acceleration in deposit
growth (excluding deposits of the public oil
company, SONATRACH) to 16 percent (yearon-year) at end-June 2011, while growth in
credit to the economy remained steady at
15 percent (year-on-year, excluding buyback
of public companies’ debt by the treasury). In
this context, the Bank of Algeria (BA)
continued to absorb excess liquidity generated
by government expenditure and the
hydrocarbon sector, with liquidity absorption
through two deposit windows amounting to
17 percent of GDP at end-August 2011.
4.
The fiscal stance has been very
expansionary, on the back of higher
hydrocarbon revenues. In 2011, Algeria will
record a new budget deficit of about 4 percent
of GDP, with a significant increase in total
revenues (22 percent in nominal terms) more
than offset by the growth in total expenditure
(32 percent). Current expenditure is projected
to grow by 50 percent as a result of (i) civil
service pay increases resulting from the
ongoing implementation of higher salary
structures and back payments for 2008 and
2009, and (ii) the implementation of various
measures to support employment, SMEs, and
food prices. In turn, capital expenditure is
expected to increase by 7 percent reflecting
the final phase of the 2005–09 PIP. While
nonhydrocarbon revenues are expected to
increase by 13 percent, consolidating their
upward trend of past years owing to tax
administration reform, they will only cover
41 percent of current expenditures (49 percent

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

excluding salary back payments), the lowest
level in a decade. In all, following two years of
decline, the nonhydrocarbon primary deficit is
expected to increase to 49 percent of NHGDP
in 2011. Thanks to still large nonbank and nondebt-creating financing from public entities,
gross government debt and budgetary savings
in the FRR are expected to remain stable at
10 percent and 40 percent of GDP,
respectively.
5.
With higher oil prices, the external
current account surplus continues to
improve, despite strong import growth. Oil
and gas revenues increased by 30 percent
during the first nine months of 2011 owing to
higher oil and gas prices. Imports have been
rising again after holding steady during the
previous two years, with a 19 percent increase
during the first eight months of 2011. This rise
reflects an increase of 67 percent in food
products and a 40 percent increase in
consumer goods. Official reserves increased by
US$14.6 billion during the first eight months of
2011, to US$178.3 billion at end-August 2011
(the equivalent of nearly three years of imports
of goods and services).
6.
The real effective exchange rate
(REER) depreciated by 1.5 percent during
the first eight months of 2011. This reflects a
depreciation of 2.2 percent in the nominal
effective exchange rate in 2011, while the
inflation differential vis-à-vis Algeria’s main
partners was 0.7 percent. The REER remains
broadly in line with its medium-term
equilibrium level, which is linked to
fundamental factors including oil prices and
government expenditure.

THEME 1: COPING WITH SOCIAL DEMANDS WHILE
FENDING OFF INFLATIONARY PRESSURES
Near-term outlook
7.
The world economic outlook has
become more uncertain in 2011 and 2012,
and could affect Algeria’s hydrocarbon
revenues. Economic recovery is now much
slower in the advanced economies than was
expected at the start of the year. Slower
growth in advanced and, in turn, in emerging
economies could affect global demand and
prices of hydrocarbon products, with spillover
effects on Algeria’s hydrocarbon revenues.
Moreover, many countries of the Middle East
and North Africa (MENA) have been immersed
in important sociopolitical transitions, which
could further affect the whole MENA region.
8.
In 2011–12, growth should remain
solid and still-high oil prices should support
Algeria’s external balance and budgetary
revenues, but risks of higher inflation have
increased. In 2011 and 2012, the growthsupporting effect of the multiyear PIP is
expected to maintain nonhydrocarbon growth
at about 5 percent, and to bring overall real
GDP growth to 2 ½–3 percent. Higher
international prices for food staples and civil
service pay rises have so far not led to a
significant pickup in inflation, because of
increased subsidies for basic food products, a
higher level of household savings, greater
demand for imports, and active absorption of
bank liquidity by BA. Assuming these will hold,
inflation could stay at about 4–4½ percent in
2011–12, but the risk of rising inflation fueled
by more buoyant domestic demand has
increased. Oil prices still forecasted at high
levels (the Fall 2011 WEO projected oil prices

at US$103/barrel in 2011 and US$100/barrel in
2012), would help sustain a current account
surplus of 9.5 percent of GDP in 2011 and
5.4 percent in 2012, and hydrocarbon fiscal
revenues 25–30 percent above their 2010 level.
Background and staff views

Fiscal and income policies
9.
Fiscal policy in 2012 will center on
implementing the higher civil service salary
scale and social and job-support policies.
The authorities will pursue the civil service pay
structure revision that began in 2010, which
raises civil service salaries, on average, by
about 50 percent from 2008, the year when
the new salary scale was adopted. The draft
2012 budget also calls for the extension of
socioeconomic measures adopted in 2011 to
assist low-income groups and support
employment, at a cost equivalent to 4 percent
of GDP. These measures include price support
for certain food staples (cereals, powdered
milk, soybean oil, and sugar), expansion of the
program to facilitate civil servants’ access to
housing, and increased support for
mechanisms to reduce youth unemployment.
The budget will also cover the cost of
subsidizing lending rates for investments by
SMEs, and the rescheduling of the debt of
heavily indebted but viable SMEs. These
measures, largely designed to maintain social
cohesion, will contribute to keeping current
incompressible expenditure at an elevated
level of about 45 percent of NHGDP in 2012.
Flat oil tax revenues would not make it
possible for the still-high levels of expenditure

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 5

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

ALGERIA

to be covered fully by overall revenues, and
the budget would record a deficit for the
fourth year in a row in 2012, equivalent to
6 percent of GDP.
10.
The rising trend in expenditure
should be broken and its composition
rebalanced. While the large available fiscal
savings can allow the maintenance of relatively
high levels of budget expenditures in the short
term, the recent sharp increase could push
aggregate demand up excessively and have
detrimental effects on inflation and
competitiveness. The authorities should ensure
that public spending is of good quality and
effective, and benefits the population in an
equitable way. In particular, policies for better
targeting of current expenditure, including
subsidies and social transfers, should be
developed. While current spending is rising,
the 2012 budget calls for a significant decrease
in capital expenditures, a major change from
past years. It will be important, however, to
maintain investment expenditure actually
executed in 2012 at a level similar to the 2011
outcome in order to support higher potential
output in the future, provided that efforts to
strengthen the efficiency and control of capital
spending continue.
11.
The impact of substantial increases
in wage earners’ income on domestic
demand will need to be contained to avoid
a pick-up in inflation. Substantial increases in
civil servants’ salaries are being extended to
public companies, and will be accompanied by
a further increase in the minimum wage
(20 percent in January 2012) and pensions.
These increases will likely generate pressure
for additional wage hikes in the private sector.
These increases in real wages appear to
substantially exceed productivity gains.
Moreover, back payments of salary increases

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

for 2008–09, which are planned to be spread
over only two years, will provide substantial
additional income for civil servants (8 percent
of NHGDP in 2011 and 7 percent in 2012). If
this additional income translates entirely into
additional demand for domestic goods and
services, inflationary pressures would intensify.
In such an event, monetary policy would need
to be tightened and imports increased to
cover excess demand.

Monetary and exchange rate policy
12.
The authorities should continue to
pursue a monetary policy aimed at
controlling excess liquidity and inflationary
pressures. The BA continues to absorb,
through two short-term repurchase and
deposit facilities, the growing liquidity in the
banking system generated by oil and gas
revenues and government expenditures, to
limit their impact on inflation while keeping
interest rates unchanged. So far, the salary
increase for civil servants does not seem to
have led to inflationary pressures for prices of
goods and services measured by the CPI, but
price data for other sorts of assets, such as real
estate, are not available. Banking deposit data
suggest that private savings have increased
while the growth in private consumption has
been covered in part by increased imports.
Besides these factors, the emergence of
additional inflationary pressures will also
depend on how companies in the goods and
service sectors will pass through higher labor

ALGERIA 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

costs. In this context, the authorities should
exercise the greatest vigilance and consider
tightening monetary policy early to prevent
inflationary pressures from materializing and
credit from expanding too quickly. To this end,
the BA could increase interest rates to give a
strong signal about the cost of credit in the
economy and for returns on savings.
13.
The authorities can continue to align
the REER close to its equilibrium level, but
exchange rate fundamentals should be
strengthened. The BA continues to conduct
an active exchange rate policy of managed
float, with the objective of stabilizing the REER
close to its equilibrium level (Appendix 1). The
equilibrium exchange rate is estimated to have
appreciated in the last few years, reflecting the
increases in government spending and oil
prices, entailing the risk of ―Dutch disease‖
welfare-reducing effects. However, in the
staff’s baseline medium-term scenario, which
assumes fiscal consolidation and structural
reforms, this increase will be reversed by 2016.
Authorities’ views
14.
Fiscal prudence remains a priority,
but maintaining social cohesion is a key
objective in the short term. The authorities
are aware of the need to curb expenditure
growth–especially current expenditure– to
reinforce medium-term fiscal sustainability.
They agreed that a large share of the increase
in expenditure is due to salary increases for
public servants in 2011 and 2012, which was
decided in 2008. However, they consider that
these increases and their extension to other
sectors, as well as the socioeconomic support
measures aimed at job creation, social
housing, and private investment, were
necessary to improve the standard of living of

large parts of the population, in the context of
pressing social demands. Drawing on Algeria’s
past experience, as well as recent regional
developments, maintaining social stability is of
paramount importance to the preservation of
medium-term macroeconomic stability.
15.
The authorities are committed to
ensuring good quality and efficiency of
public expenditures. They will continue to
protect the implementation of the PIP, which is
viewed as essential to improving Algeria’s
competitiveness and growth potential. In this
respect, they aim at better project selection to
improve expenditure quality and effectiveness.
The authorities also believe that the new
socioeconomic support measures—especially
employment and SME support—will help to
support Algeria’s economic activity, and
broaden the nonhydrocarbon tax base.
16.
The authorities remain vigilant
about inflationary pressures and consider
their policy of absorbing liquidity to be
fully effective. The monetary authorities’ key
objective is to contain inflationary pressures.
They believe that the objective has been
achieved during the last two years with
inflation falling to around 4 percent, a level
that the authorities are comfortable with.
Moreover, they consider that the large
increase in wage earners’ incomes and public
spending did not generate inflationary
pressures because most of the additional
income has been devoted to purchasing
imported goods or saved for acquiring real
estate. Nonetheless, they remain firmly
committed to changing gears should
inflationary pressures arise. The authorities
also reiterated their commitment to keeping
the real exchange rate close to its equilibrium
level and consistent with external stability.

THEME 2: ENSURING MEDIUM-TERM FISCAL
SUSTAINABILITY
Background and Staff views
17.
Higher oil prices have improved the
medium-term financial outlook but it has
also been seriously weakened by the steep
rise in current public expenditure. The
baseline scenario below shows that, if
government expenditure increases on the
basis of the envisaged measures (including
civil service pay rises and other support
measures adopted in 2011 and the 2012
budget), in 2016, the oil savings fund (FRR), as
a percentage of GDP, will be reduced to
almost half of its 2010 level, that is, to
16 percent of GDP. The oil price that would
balance the 2011 budget (excluding salary
backpayments) would rise to US$100/barrel
from US$44/barrel in 2006, and would increase
further to about US$110 by 2016, leaving the
fiscal position highly vulnerable to a major
slump in oil prices. The current account surplus
would fall to roughly 5 percent of GDP, while

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

reserves would be equal to four years’ worth of
goods and services imports.
18.
Public finances are vulnerable to a
worsening of international conditions,
which could lead to a prolonged period of
lower oil prices. An alternative scenario, which
assumes lower international oil prices
(US$55/barrel in 2012 and US$70/barrel
thereafter), shows a major deterioration in
Algeria’s macroeconomic balances over the
medium term. By 2016, the FRR would be
down to its legal minimum level of 740 billion
dinars (about US$10 billion), and fiscal deficits
would be financed by increasing government
borrowing, which could exceed 26 percent of
GDP. The current account balance would be in
deficit, reducing reserves to the equivalent of
2½ years of goods and services imports in
2016. In this alternative scenario, it is likely that
public investment expenditure would be cut,
leading to slower growth and higher
unemployment.

19.
A medium-term fiscal framework
based on the principle of permanent
income also underscores the financial
vulnerabilities resulting from the sharp
expansion in current expenditure. An
analysis based on a permanent income
framework (with nonrenewable hydrocarbon
resources) suggests that fiscal consolidation
will be needed to bring the fiscal position back
to a sustainable level in the medium term. This
medium-term fiscal framework, based on the
principle of maintaining a constant level of
income after hydrocarbon reserves are
depleted, provides useful benchmarks for
ensuring medium-term fiscal sustainability and
for efforts to strengthen control and
effectiveness of expenditure. In this framework,

the goal of maintaining hydrocarbon wealth
per capita constant over the long term is more
cautious and preferable. In this context, the
recent substantial increase in operating
expenses, if not progressively reversed, could
force the authorities to proceed more
cautiously in executing the new PIP for
2010–14.

20.
The authorities should formulate
and adopt fiscal consolidation measures
over the medium term.
Rationalizing current expenditure. While
investment spending was the main driver of
expenditure expansion in 2006–08, current
spending has put more pressure on total
spending since last year. As a proportion of
total expenditure, current expenditure will
reach 64 percent in 2011 (excluding salary
back-payments) from 54 percent in 2008–09.
Certain expenditures will increase even more
quickly in the medium term, as socioeconomic
support measures are carried out and new
infrastructure is built. This increase will further
constrain implementation of fiscal policy
because current expenditures are more
difficult to compress. Hence, it is imperative to
assess the effectiveness of additional
expenditures to decide whether or not they
should be continued. Moreover, following the
substantial pay rises, it will be important to
keep tight control on wage bill growth in the
years to come by restricting new hiring and
future salary increases. The targeting of
transfers and subsidies needs to improve, so
that these can better serve vulnerable
population groups. To that end, the authorities
should accelerate the work under way, with the
support of the World Bank, on social transfer
targeting.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Better controlling high-priority capital
expenditure. Capital expenditure will
represent 36 percent of total expenditures in
2011, down from 47 percent in 2009–10. This
relative decline will likely continue in 2012.
Maintaining existing levels of expenditure will
require a higher pace of execution than in the
past. In view of future pressures to contain
capital expenditure, the authorities must
ensure sound selection of projects to improve
the overall effectiveness of expenditure. In this
context, the authorities’ efforts, since the
creation of the national commission to
monitor the implementation of the PIP (CNED
in French), in better overseeing the
implementation of major infrastructure
projects, have enabled budget savings and
more effective project execution, and should
be pursued.
Increasing nonhydrocarbon resources.
Major tax administration reforms implemented
by the Directorate General of Taxation (DGI)
have resulted in an increase of
nonhydrocarbon revenues by 15 percent a
year over the past five years. Nevertheless, the
ratio of current expenditures covered by
nonhydrocarbon revenues is expected to
further decline in 2012, and to reach its lowest
level since 2000. Further efforts to achieve key
objectives of the tax administration reform will
be required, in particular, implementing the
DGI’s information system (a project which has
been delayed) and strengthening the direction
and oversight of tax administration (a project
launched in 2010 in cooperation with the
French tax administration).
21.
Accelerating the process of
modernizing budget systems and assuring
greater transparency in public financial
management are essential to controlling
the rapid increase of expenditures. The

ALGERIA 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

authorities intend to develop a system of fiscal
management based on outcome objectives, so
that the performance of various programs can
be assessed and, hence, the control and
effectiveness of government expenditure can
be measured. To that end, better fiscal
planning needs to be developed. The
authorities have made efforts in a number of
areas to develop new tools such as the
macroeconomic forecasting models within the
Ministry of Finance. However, the
implementation of the medium-term fiscal
framework being developed by the Budget
Department, with World Bank support, is
experiencing delays. The authorities thus need
to take all necessary actions to speed up the
full implementation of fiscal reforms. Drafting
and adopting budget review laws since last
year represent important steps toward greater
transparency in government finance.
Additional efforts will be needed to improve
the public availability of government finance
statistics, including statistics on budget
execution.
Authorities’ views
22.
The authorities are committed to
medium-term fiscal sustainability. They have
recognized that the current expenditure path
is not sustainable, and are concerned about

the greater reliance on hydrocarbon fiscal
revenues to finance the budget. In order to
ensure medium-term sustainability, the
authorities intend to develop budget
consolidation measures such as targeting of
social transfers, a project currently under way
with World Bank support, and will continue
their efforts to increase nonhydrocarbon
revenues. Moreover, they started to implement
more market-based mechanisms for financing
autonomous public entities, including
hospitals.
23.
The authorities consider that
sustained budget reform efforts will also
strengthen medium-term fiscal
sustainability. The authorities are committed
to improving the quality and the efficiency of
expenditure through the reform of budgetary
process and better coordination for
developing better budgetary planning tools. In
particular, the increased role of the CNED with
the new 2010–14 PIP, for which no new large
project receives a budget allocation without
CNED’s approval based on transparent
evaluation, will contribute to enhancing the
effectiveness of public investment. Efforts to
further enhance budget transparency will also
be pursued, building on the finance organic
law and the renewed practice of adopting
budget execution review laws.

THEME 3: PREPARING FOR A NEW GROWTH MODEL
TO ADDRESS YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT
24.
Algeria’s main challenge remains to
ensure sustainable, diversified, and private
investment-led growth to reduce
unemployment, especially for the youth,
and provide opportunities for all.
Addressing this challenge will require

improving financial sector intermediation, and
implementing more ambitious structural
reforms to improve the business environment,
the labor market, and Algeria’s integration into
the global economy.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 11

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

ALGERIA

Medium-term outlook
25.
The medium-term growth outlook
remains stable, provided that a more
ambitious program of structural reforms is
implemented. The prospects for NHGDP
growth remain favorable, provided that deeper
structural reforms lead to increased and more
productive private investment. This will be
needed to compensate for the expected
decline in the growth-supporting effect of the
public investment program, which has reached
a plateau in terms of execution of large
projects. Under this assumption,
nonhydrocarbon growth could average about
5 percent a year during the period 2012 to
2016. Without reform and strong development
of the private sector, nonhydrocarbon growth
could be 2 percentage points lower. After
declining in the last few years, growth in the oil
and gas sector is expected to be moderate and
restrained by global demand and market
conditions for natural gas. As a result, total
GDP growth could hover around 3½ percent
during the same period.
26.
Under this scenario, unemployment
would decline only slightly, at best.
Unemployment has decreased significantly
during the past 10 years, but remains high for
the youth, in particular young graduates
(21.5 percent), and women (19 percent). This
overall decrease was the combined result of
moderating growth of the working-age
population, broadly stable participation rates
(around 42 percent for total population, but
only 14 percent for women), and sustained
NHGDP growth. However, the job content of
growth has been declining recently—the flip
side of slightly improving labor productivity
growth—and fewer than 38 percent of the
working-age population (11 percent of
women) have a declared job. Based on the

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

medium-term baseline scenario, and
depending on the assumption for
employment-growth elasticity (either stable or
continuing its recent declining trend), total
unemployment in 2016 would be between
8 percent and 11 percent, and youth
unemployment between 19 percent and
21 percent.
Background and Staff views

Structural reforms
27.
Developing the private sector is of
paramount importance to supporting
diversified growth and reducing
unemployment. The private sector remains
relatively narrow and fragmented, and has
limited capacity for innovation. In recent years,
the authorities have undertaken initiatives to
support the development of SMEs, but with
limited effect. Additional measures have been
adopted following the tripartite consultations
in 2011, including investment loan subsidies
and debt rescheduling for SMEs. Although
these measures seem to be moving in the right
direction, it is still too early to assess their
impact. Sustained efforts need to be devoted
to improving the perception of the business
climate, which is still viewed negatively
(Appendix 3). More ambitious reforms are
needed to boost private-sector growth. In this
respect, foreign direct investment (FDI) should
play a larger role in the nonhydrocarbon
sectors. The level of nonhydrocarbon FDI
remains low and the measures introduced in
2009 appear to be having an adverse impact
on foreign investors’ perceptions, particularly
for SMEs. The authorities should assess the
impact of these measures and consider
introducing more flexibility in order to create a
more attractive environment for foreign direct

ALGERIA 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

investors, who are critical for transferring
technology and knowhow.

continued efforts to join the World Trade
Organization.

28.
Besides aiming at higher growth,
labor market reforms could help to reduce
unemployment. On average, unemployed
people have a higher level of education than
the economically active population as a whole,
which indicates that graduates of secondary
schools and institutions of advanced education
have particular difficulties in finding jobs. In
recent years, the authorities have launched a
number of initiatives to reduce youth
unemployment, in particular by supporting the
creation of microenterprises and subsidizing
young people’s salaries. These measures need
to be supplemented by reforms to make the
labor market more flexible and to reduce
recruitment costs. The tax measures that the
authorities have adopted to reduce employers’
contributions for social benefits go in the right
direction; however, more reforms are needed
to ensure that young people have jobs that
will last, including a reform to align minimumwage increases with productivity gains,
lowering payroll taxes and other mandated
costs, and incentives for part-time work and
flexible working arrangements.

30.
The authorities should continue
their efforts to improve governance. These
will include further improvements on fighting
corruption and combating money laundering
and the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT),
taking into account the recommendations of
the Financial Action Task Force.

29.
The authorities should strengthen
their efforts to integrate Algeria into the
regional and global economies. Algeria has
been a member of the Arab Free Trade Area
(ZALE) since 2009, and is undertaking
initiatives to develop trade and cooperation
with other African countries, including the
initiation of discussions with the West Africa
Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) to
conclude trade and investment agreements.
These initiatives should be complemented with
moving forward into new phases of integration
within the framework of the Association
Agreement with the European Union and

Financial sector
31.
Financial intermediation and the
depth of financial markets remain fairly
limited. Despite being highly liquid, banks are
very prudent in extending credit due to
difficulty of assessing credit risks. The lack of a
reliable credit reporting system in Algeria,
compared with other Middle East and North
Africa (MENA) countries, is considered to be
one of the main factors hindering access to
finance. Also, the financial performance of
state-owned banks (representing about
90 percent of banking system assets) has been
weaker than that of private banks.1 As a result,
financial intermediation in Algeria is weak, with
a credit ratio of 39 percent of NHGDP. The
level of nonperforming loans (NPLs) continues
to decline, reflecting better management of
new risks and the increase in outstanding
credit, but it remains high for public banks at
around 19 percent in June 2011, compared
with 24 percent at end-2009. Overall, the
banks have an appropriate level of capital and
do not represent a risk for macroeconomic
stability. The stock exchange remains
underdeveloped, with only seven companies
listed as of September 2011. Given that the

90 percent of system assets.
Nonpublic banks are all foreign.
Loans in arrears (100 percent provisioning requirement).
Loans performing but at risk (30 percent or 50 percent provisioning).

32.
The authorities should accelerate
financial sector modernization and reform
efforts, including following up on the
recommendations of the 2007 FSAP update.
Public banks should continue modernizing
their risk information and assessment
operating systems, particularly to ensure that
new incentives to grant loans to SMEs will not
create additional default risks. Substantial
efforts have been made to reduce NPLs, but

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

more is needed to identify solutions to deal
with the legacy of old loans in default. All
possible ways should continue to be explored
to bring public banks (90 percent of banking
sector assets) to the highest international
standards, and to improve their control,
management, and governance. As the ban on
consumer lending (excluding mortgages) in
effect since 2009 has affected the deepening
of banking activity, the authorities should

ALGERIA 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

accelerate efforts to establish a centralized
household credit registry, which should enable
this ban to be lifted. As the requirement of
using bank cards or checks for all payments of
500,000 dinars or more has been deferred
indefinitely, the authorities should pursue their
efforts to modernize the country’s payment
system to reduce the high level of currency in
circulation (26 percent of NHGDP).
33.
The authorities continue to
strengthen banking supervision. The gradual
introduction of a new bank rating system, with
a pilot to begin by the end of 2011, and the
adoption of a new banking accounting plan in
2010, will help to improve credit risk
management and banking supervision.
Improved banking supervision regulations
were prepared with IMF technical assistance.
With these new tools, the authorities should
aim at ensuring that measures to encourage
loans to SMEs and mortgage credit, and the
debt rescheduling plans for viable SMEs, will
not lead to a deterioration of bank portfolios.
The authorities have also prepared preliminary
financial stability reports, which it will be useful
to publish.
Authorities’ views
34.
The authorities’ main medium-term
objective remains to reduce Algeria’s
dependence on the hydrocarbon sector and
develop the private sector to create more
jobs and offer better opportunities for all.
The authorities believe that many of the
socioeconomic support measures adopted in
2011 should help to boost economic
diversification. Moreover, the new
infrastructure being built with the PIP should
enhance Algeria’s competitiveness in the
medium term. Efforts to enable private sector
development will also include support by the

National Investment Fund for public-private
partnerships in strategic sectors important for
innovation. These policies are complemented
with others aimed at facilitating access to the
labor market for new entrants and creation of
microenterprises.
35.
The authorities are concerned by the
relatively unfavorable perception of
Algeria’s business climate and have
reinforced their focus on improving it. The
government launched a series of political and
economic initiatives in early 2011 to improve
citizen participation, reinforce government
accountability, and boost nonhydrocarbon
growth. In terms of economic reforms, the
authorities have organized cross-sector
tripartite consultations to identify measures
required to improve the business climate,
which should be translated into an array of
business climate improvement reforms.
36.
The authorities remain cautious
about full-fledged trade openness. They are
concerned that trade openness has not
brought the expected results for Algeria, which
has seen imports growing substantially but has
not experienced any boost in the export
diversification. For this reason, authorities are
negotiating more gradual trade integration
with multilateral partners.
37.
Financial sector reform remains a
cornerstone for supporting private
investment growth. The BA has continued its
efforts to modernize and reinforce the financial
system through regulatory reform and
improved supervision. Adoption of the new
accounting rules in 2010 has helped to
improve reporting and transparency in
reporting. Regarding NPLs, the authorities
have supported the banks’ implementation of
a distressed-assets-management company and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 15

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

ALGERIA

will request banks to write off their oldest
NPLs. The authorities recognized unexpected
delays in important projects such as the

household credit registry, but they are hoping
to finalize it in 2012.

STAFF APPRAISAL
38.
Algeria has recorded satisfactory
growth, but it may be reaching a tipping
point. During the past decade, generally
prudent macroeconomic management in the
context of increasing international oil prices
has resulted in robust growth, low inflation,
the accumulation of large international
reserves and budgetary savings, and a
substantial reduction of debt levels. However,
the efforts to reduce the dependence on
hydrocarbon wealth and to promote the
diversification of the economy have been
disappointing. With the spillover effects of the
public investment program on the
nonhydrocarbon sectors of the Algerian
economy decelerating, growth is likely to slow
down without a more ambitious structural
reform agenda.
39.
High hydrocarbon revenues and
budgetary savings provide scope for
addressing pressing social demands and
maintaining social stability, but the
substantial expansion in current public
expenditure in 2011 should be moderated
to avoid excessive inflationary pressures.
The growing systemic liquidity resulting from
higher hydrocarbon revenue, substantial public
salary increases, and larger social transfers
have not yet translated into higher inflation,
but the risk of an inflationary spike has
increased. Growth in income transfers and
wages will need to be moderated and spread
over time as far as possible. In addition to
moderating current public spending, the
authorities should consider early action to

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

tighten monetary policy to avoid inflationary
pressures, through an interest rate hike and
larger liquidity absorption.
40.
Algeria’s long-term fiscal
sustainability and its capacity to withstand
prolonged negative oil price shocks will be
seriously challenged by the substantial
expansion in current public spending. The
significant growth in current expenditure in
2011 poses substantial challenges to Algeria’s
budget sustainability as these types of
expenses are less compressible. This
expenditure growth is making Algeria’s fiscal
position vulnerable to the risk of prolonged
lower international oil prices, which could
result from a weaker global economy, despite
the large budget savings accumulated so far. A
fiscal sustainability analysis based on a
permanent income framework points to the
need for medium-term fiscal consolidation.
Since upward pressures on expenditure growth
will continue in the near future, the authorities
should adopt fiscal consolidation measures
which could include limits to wage increases
and new hires, and better targeting of
transfers, by means testing social benefits. The
increased mobilization of nonhydrocarbon
resources and the continuation of tax
administration reforms will also contribute to
reducing the budget’s dependency on volatile
hydrocarbon revenues.
41.
Delays in budgetary reform could
hamper efforts to improve the quality and
efficiency of public expenditure. While the

ALGERIA 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

budget is the key lever in using and
redistributing hydrocarbon wealth, the
relatively modest gains recorded by Algeria in
real GDP per capita or other social indicators,
in view of very large public spending, as well as
the lack of progress toward a more diversified
and productive economy, point to the need to
enhance spending quality and efficiency. Staff
welcomes the progress made in budgetary
reform and planning but considers that the
delays in certain key areas, such as mediumterm budgetary planning, could damage the
efforts to enhance the control and quality of
expenditure. Initiatives such as the creation of
the CNED to monitor the quality of capital
expenditure have been successful and should
be extended to other areas.
42.
The BA can continue its exchange
rate policy consistent with long-term
equilibrium level, but exchange rate
fundamentals should be strengthened. Staff
concurs with the authorities’ policy of
intervening in the exchange rate market to
avoid misalignments. Exchange rate
fundamentals, including the fiscal position and
productivity gains, should be strengthened to
avoid a real appreciation, which would result in
―Dutch disease effects‖ common to many
commodity exporters.
43.
To make a significant dent in
unemployment, a more ambitious structural
reform agenda should be implemented to
enhance the business climate and
competitiveness. With public investment
expected to play a less dynamic role in
economic growth, the private sector will need
to become a stronger engine for growth and
job creation. Without ambitious reforms,
medium-term growth prospects will become
weaker. The recent measures to support SME

financing and the consultations with social
partners to improve the business environment
should have a positive, albeit small, impact on
private investment and economic
diversification. Moreover, advances in financial
reform should facilitate the private sector’s
access to credit. However, despite certain
advances, important constraints remain to be
addressed. Labor cost increases out of line
with productivity gains will negatively affect
competitiveness. The rules for FDI
implemented since 2009, and heavy
bureaucratic procedures, discourage foreign
investors and could prevent much-needed
foreign technology transfers. Similarly, more
decisive measures to expose the public
financial sector to more competition through
the expansion of private banks and to further
improve public banks’ operations and
governance would enhance financial
intermediation. The authorities should also
persevere in their efforts to further integrate
Algeria into regional and global trade. Growthenhancing policies could usefully be
complemented with active labor market
policies, aimed at enhancing matching of skills
and reducing hiring rigidities.
44.
Staff welcomes Algeria’s
cancellation of US$702 million in loans
under the Enhanced HIPC initiative.
45.
It is proposed that the next Article IV
consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Appendix 1. Exchange Rate Assessment
An analysis using the CGER methodology
suggests that the current level of the REER is
broadly in line with medium-term
fundamentals, provided these fundamentals
will be strengthened in line with staff
projections. Using estimated coefficients for an
oil producer like Algeria, the REER
misalignment was calculated under the
Macroeconomic Balance (MB), the External
Sustainability (ES), and the Equilibrium Real
Exchange Rate (ERER) approaches. While the
current account (CA) projected surplus in 2011
is above the medium-term norm, as estimated
by the MB approach, it is projected to decline
slightly below the norm by 2016, suggesting
that the REER would converge to its mediumterm equilibrium.1 Also under the ES approach,
projection of the underlying CA (consistent
with this approach) is in line with the CA norm,
suggesting again convergence of the REER to

its medium-term equilibrium in the staff
baseline scenario.

A country-specific long-run co-integration
relationship was also estimated for the
reduced form Equilibrium Real Effective
Exchange Rate (EREER). Under this
specification, the EREER is determined by
Algeria’s terms of trade (ToT), the differential
of output per worker in Algeria vis-a-vis trade
partners (prod), and government spending as
a percentage of GDP (G) (t-stats between
parentheses):

ln EREER   0.38  0.17 ln ToT   1.85 ln( prod )  1.20 ln G 
1.84

Calculating the EREER using the medium-term
WEO projections for the explanatory variables
implies an undervaluation of 13.3 percent in
2011. The EREER has appreciated in the past
few years under the effect of increased
government spending and oil prices, entailing
the risk of the ―Dutch disease‖ phenomenon.
The projection of the EREER over the medium
term points to a gradual depreciation
reflecting lower public spending in percentage
of GDP and a wider productivity gap vis-a-vis
the trading partners. The REER has slightly

14.84

3.76

depreciated since end-2010.

Appendix 2. Public Spending Composition and Potential Effects on Growth
dependent on oil prices. In terms of expenses,
Algeria has been devoting a larger share of
revenues to capital expenditure and savings,
which is consistent with the implementation of
the PIP, the creation of the oil savings fund,
and the sharp reduction in government debt.
Nonhydrocarbon revenues barely cover the
cost of public salaries. While countries rich in
natural resources have the capacity to engage
in significant infrastructure investment
programs, this does not always translate into
sustained levels of economic growth. Figure 2B
shows the interaction between public capital
spending and real per capita GDP growth
during the period 2001–11. Algeria has the
largest public investment share of GDP in the
sample but it has not generated higher
growth. One reason could be that public
policies (and public spending programs) have
not attracted enough private capital to boost
the diversification of the economy needed to
achieve faster growth. Figure 2C shows that
private investment contributes significantly to
economic growth but remains low in Algeria
relative to other countries in the sample.

Revenues from exhaustible natural resources
are intrinsically temporary because they are
derived from a depleting stock of resources
and they are unreliable, due to the volatility of
commodity prices. Consequently, some
significant proportion of the revenues they
generate should be saved, so that increases in
consumption over time can be sustained.
Figure 2A shows the composition of
accumulated revenues and spending
categories in Algeria during 1991–2010.
Hydrocarbon revenues more than doubled (in
constant dollar terms) in the 2000s from the
previous decade, and their share in total
revenues increased from 63 percent to
72 percent, making the Algerian budget more

Moreover, Algeria has lower levels of public

One key explanation for disappointing results
of the authorities’ efforts to diversify the
economy is its low competitiveness and weak
business climate. Figure 3A presents the World
Economic Forum (WEF) Global Competitiveness

Index and its components for MENA countries.
It plots Algeria in comparison with the best
and worst performers in each category. The
MENA countries have an average low ranking
with respect to other regions (e.g., Asia or
Emerging Europe) and Algeria ranks low within
MENA countries considered in the WEF index.
Algeria has the worst rankings for all MENA in
three important categories: goods markets
efficiency, labor market efficiency, and
business sophistication. Moreover, it ranks well
below the average in all the other WEF index
components with the exception of market size
and the macroeconomic environment.

Exchange Rate Arrangement
1.
From January 21, 1974 to October 1,
1994, the exchange rate of the dinar was
determined on the basis of a fixed relationship
with a basket of currencies, adjusted from time
to time. On October 1, 1994, the Bank of
Algeria introduced a managed float for the
dinar through daily fixing sessions that
included six commercial banks. This system has
been replaced by an interbank foreign
exchange market as of January 2, 1996. On
December 15, 2011, the average of the buying
and selling rates for the U.S. dollar was

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

$1 = DA 74.6, equivalent to SDR 1 = DA 114.6.
No margin limits are imposed on the buying
and selling exchange rates in the interbank
foreign exchange market, except for a margin
of DA 0.017 between the buying and selling
rates of the Bank of Algeria for the dinar
against the U.S. dollar.

The exchange regime is classified as

ALGERIA

ALGERIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
Government finance statistics, national accounts, and prices have several shortcomings that hamper
analysis.
National Accounts: Key shortcomings in national accounts include an outdated base year for
constant price GDP estimates, long lags for publication of data, and incomplete application of the
1993 System of National Accounts. STA has recommended giving priority to compiling GDP at
constant prices (including quarterly accounts) and to rebasing the GDP series. In the second semester
of 2011 authorities have started to prepare quarterly accounts.
Price Statistics: Data are published with a delay of about three months.
Government finance statistics: Key shortcomings include insufficient institutional coverage
(coverage is limited to Budgetary Central Government, albeit in a wide sense, including the general
budget, the annexed budget, and the special treasury accounts), classification problems, long lags for
production of statistics, and lack of reconciliation of financing with the monetary accounts. Key factors
behind these weaknesses include the lack of financial resources allocated to the compilation of
statistics, insufficient interagency coordination, and concerns about accuracy that give rise to
reluctance to publish provisional data.

Monetary statistics: The authorities need to ensure the data consistency with the methodology in
the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual, 2000. Timely reporting of balance sheet data by some
state-owned commercial banks remains problematic, and most commercial banks do not report all
data needed to compile the monetary survey. Prudential data reported by state-owned banks are
unreliable and not timely.
Balance of payments: Although balance of payments statistics are generally of good quality, they
could benefit from a survey for direct investment data.
II. Data Standards and Quality

Dissemination System (GDDS) on April 21, 2009.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Algeria

On January 11, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Algeria on a lapse of time basis.1
Background
Despite an uncertain international economic environment, the Algerian economy has been
doing relatively well. Real nonhydrocarbon GDP growth in 2010 reached 6 percent and
total GDP growth was 3 percent. Overall inflation fell to 3.9 percent in 2010 due to a fall in
fresh food prices, while nonfood inflation remained low. Unemployment continued to
decline slightly to 10 percent at end-2010, but youth and female unemployment remain
high. The generally prudent macroeconomic management during 2000–10 has enabled
large external reserves to be accumulated and sizable budgetary savings to be built up in
the oil stabilization fund, while substantially reducing debt levels.
In 2011, growth is estimated to have remained solid and higher oil prices are strengthening
Algeria’s external balance and boosting fiscal revenues. The ripple effects of the Public
Investment Program (PIP) are expected to maintain nonhydrocarbon growth at about
5 percent, and to bring overall GDP growth to about 2.5 percent. Higher international prices

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. This year’s Article IV consultation was concluded on a lapse of time basis.
Under the IMF’s lapse of time procedures, the Executive Board completes Article IV
consultations without convening formal discussions.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

for food and substantial civil service pay rises have so far not led to significantly higher
inflation, because of increased subsidies for basic food products, a higher level of
household savings, greater demand for imports, and a vigilant monetary policy. Overall,
inflation is expected to have stayed at about 4 percent in 2011. With higher oil prices, the
current account surplus will increase to 9.5 percent of GDP in 2011 and hydrocarbon fiscal
revenues rise by 30 percent. Official reserves have grown by US$16 billion since end-2010,
reaching US$178 billion at end-August 2011 (three years of imports). The budget will
remain in deficit at around 4 percent of GDP as a 32 percent increase in total expenditure,
in particular higher public salaries and transfers, will more than offset higher fiscal
revenues.
The outlook remains favorable in the short term, but fiscal sustainability and financial
stability over the medium term have become more dependent on volatile oil prices. Growth
will continue to be supported in the short term by public investment and the national
hydrocarbon company’s investment program. Nonhydrocarbon GDP could grow by
5 percent in 2012, but hydrocarbon output would continue to decline because of weak
global demand, constraining overall growth to about 3–3½ percent. Inflation would remain
at about 4 percent if fresh food prices remain subdued and inflationary pressures from
increased wages are contained. Over the medium term, the relatively high projected oil
prices would sustain a positive external balance and large fiscal revenues, but the budget
balance will remain in deficit.
Nevertheless, the expansionary fiscal stance of recent years has made the fiscal position
vulnerable to oil price swings as the break-even price that balances the budget now slightly
exceeds US$100/barrel. Important downside risks will arise in the event of a worsening in
the international economic environment and a prolonged decline in oil prices. The external
and fiscal positions would be seriously weakened, likely forcing scaling down public
investment and leading to slower growth and higher unemployment. Also, much smaller
resources in the oil stabilization fund would be left over for future generations.
Important challenges persist, including the need for diversification of the economy,
improving the business climate, reducing unemployment, as well as curtailing medium-term
vulnerabilities. With public investment expected to play a less dynamic role in the economy,
the private sector will need to become a stronger engine for growth and employment
creation. To achieve this objective, in 2011 the authorities launched a series of
consultations with social partners to improve the business environment, which is central to
improving long-term growth prospects.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Algeria’s overall good economic performance in recent
years amid a difficult international economic environment. Nevertheless, they noted that
significant challenges persist, and encouraged the authorities to renew their efforts to
30

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

preserve macroeconomic stability, restore fiscal prudence, and diversify the economy with
a stronger private sector. Further reducing unemployment, especially among the young,
and enhancing economic opportunities for all remain pressing needs. More decisive
structural reforms are vital to achieving these goals.
Directors stressed that while high oil prices provide scope for addressing pressing social
demands and maintaining social stability, this should be managed carefully to avoid
inflationary pressures and preserve medium-term fiscal sustainability. They noted that the
significant growth in current expenditure in 2011 has made the fiscal position vulnerable to
the risk of prolonged lower oil prices. Directors encouraged the authorities to adopt fiscal
consolidation measures, which could include limits on wage increases and new hires, and
a better targeting of transfers and subsidies. The continuation of greater mobilization of
nonhydrocarbon fiscal resources and tax administration reforms should also help reduce
the budget’s dependency on hydrocarbon revenues.
Directors emphasized the importance of ensuring good quality and efficiency of public
expenditure. As the budget is the main lever in using and redistributing hydrocarbon
wealth, they encouraged the authorities to build on recent progress in controlling the quality
of public investment and to advance more forcefully in key areas of budgetary reform.
Directors commended the Bank of Algeria for containing inflationary pressures and
effectively absorbing greater systemic liquidity from higher hydrocarbon revenues and large
public spending. The significant growth in liquidity has not translated into higher inflation,
but the risk of inflation has increased. In addition to the moderation of current spending,
Directors noted that the authorities should consider tightening monetary policy early to
prevent inflationary pressures from materializing. Directors considered that the exchange
rate regime has served Algeria well. They welcomed the authorities’ commitment to
maintaining the real exchange rate close to equilibrium, but emphasized the need to
strengthen exchange rate fundamentals, including the fiscal position and productivity gains.
Directors stressed that, to make a significant dent in unemployment, a more ambitious
structural reform agenda should be implemented. While welcoming the authorities’ efforts
to support SMEs financing and improve the business environment, in consultation with
social partners, they emphasized that stronger measures will be necessary for
diversification of the economy, improving competitiveness, and boosting growth and
employment. Directors also considered that the advances in financial sector reform should
continue in order to address key constraints that limit financial intermediation and access to
financing for the private sector. Moreover, they noted that increases in labor costs well
above productivity gains, and constraints to private investment, such as the limitations to
FDI adopted in 2009, hamper competitiveness and growth prospects. Directors encouraged
the authorities to ensure a better synergy between macroeconomic policies and the
structural reform agenda. They also encouraged the authorities to continue to seek better
integration of Algeria into the regional and global economy.
