INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
URUGUAY
Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2008 Article IV Consultation with Uruguay
Approved by José Fajgenbaum and Adnan Mazarei
October 9, 2008
Background
Despite recent volatility, Uruguay has so far weathered the global financial crisis and slowdown well. In
September, the exchange rate depreciated, offsetting about half of the appreciation of the previous 12 months,
while interest rates and country spreads rose. However, NIR and banks’ liquidity have remained high, public
sector’s financing requirements are covered through 2009, and there is no evidence of deposit withdrawals.
Moreover, growth is vigorous, fueled by substantial foreign investment, which has boosted productivity and
improved medium-term prospects. Nevertheless, important medium term vulnerabilities remain, including because
of the still relatively high and dollarized gross debt; and the financial system too is highly dollarized
Despite monetary tightening, inflation has remained above 7 percent, the upper limit of the target range, partly
due to higher world commodity prices. Since 2007 the authorities have raised interest rates, allowed peso
appreciation, while intervening in the foreign exchange market, and taken tax measures to partly offset the pass
through of food and fuel price inflation. Even so, real interest rates are close to zero, core inflation is well above
the headline rate, and the recent peso depreciation is likely to create further inflation pressures.
The overall fiscal balance targets are expected to be met, but policy is likely to be expansionary in 2009.
With low deficits, the debt-to-GDP ratio is improving. With expected deficits of ½–0.1 percent of GDP in 2008
and 2009 respectively, drought related spending (mainly energy) for 2008 (1½ percent of GDP) would be replaced
in 2009 by higher domestic spending.
Key policy recommendations
Curtail domestic demand to reduce inflationary pressures. Monetary policy should be tightened, but the extent
of the tightening could be reduced through a stronger fiscal stance.
Building resilience to protect prospects. Despite rapid credit, the financial system has remained sound; still,
vigilance is warranted, in light of developments in financial markets and high dollarization. Adopting cyclically
adjusted fiscal targets would enable a credible fiscal stimulus during downturns. Progress in structural reforms,
including with the expected approval by Congress of the bankruptcy and financial sector reforms will help further
protect prospects and enhance the business environment.
Authorities’ views. The authorities stressed that they felt prepared for a significant deterioration in global or
regional prospects, that inflation was a global phenomenon, and that pressures had been contained relatively well.
They preferred to wait somewhat to better assess the need for monetary tightening. They argued that they had
maintained fiscal discipline, while addressing the most pressing needs of society.
Mission. The team, comprising Messrs. Piñón (Head), Gelos (Resident Representative), and Mansilla, and
Ms. Babihuga (all WHD); Mr. Adler (SPR); and Mr. Wezel (MCM), visited Montevideo during August 6-19,
2008. Mr. Vogel (OED) also participated in the meetings.1/

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Uruguay weathered the global financial crisis and slowdown well, although in September
experienced some volatility. The economy is booming, fueled by a revival of bank credit and
substantial foreign investment in the tradable sector, which has boosted productivity and
improved medium-term prospects. During the market turmoil, the exchange rate depreciated,
while interest rates and country spreads increased. The situation has since generally
stabilized but warrants close monitoring.
Despite better preparedness, vulnerabilities remain. Banks are well capitalized and
provisioned, have substantial liquidity, their direct exposure to distressed assets appears to be
small, and deposits have continued to grow. Sovereign debt spreads have increased, peaking
at nearly 400 basis points in mid September, but have broadly moved in line with other
emerging markets. In the meantime, gross international reserves have remained broadly
stable, and there is no evidence of deposits withdrawals. Earlier in the year the government
continued to tap international markets to improve the debt profile, including by dedollarizing through swaps with support from the World Bank. About 85 percent of the debt is
at fixed rates and financing needs are covered through 2009. The current account is mainly
financed with FDI. Still, the debt and the financial system remain highly dollarized and many
non-exporting companies are indebted in foreign currency, exposing them to the risk of sharp
peso movements.
High capital inflows have challenged monetary management, and led to a sharp rise in
reserves and central bank debt earlier in the year. Until recently, while allowing significant
appreciation of the peso, the authorities continued to intervene to smooth movements, with
NIR rising by about US$2.4 billion (10 percent of GDP) since mid-2007—i.e., by about the
size of the monetary base. Sterilization operations have increased central bank debt by
US$1.7 billion (7 percent of GDP) to US$3.7 billion during the same period, with estimated
quasi-fiscal costs of about 0.3 percent of GDP. While the recent financial volatility resulted
in some outflows, the trend of FDI- related capital inflows is likely to persist, provided global
financial conditions stabilize.

4
I. BACKGROUND
1.
With sound policies and a broadly supportive environment, Uruguay has further
consolidated economic gains. With growth at over 13 percent during the first semester, even
if real GDP remained constant during the second semester, growth would still exceed
9.5 percent in 2008. Poverty has continued to fall, and unemployment has reached record
lows. Several years of real income increases and a recent pick up in bank lending are
boosting consumption. Capital formation has also risen strongly, particularly in the
agriculture, industry, and transport sectors, aided by strong FDI flows. Cautious fiscal policy
has helped reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio, while debt management operations have continued
to improve the structure of the public debt.
2.
The impact of the recent global financial turbulence has been felt, but so far
remains relatively contained. After persistent earlier appreciation pressures, Uruguay
experienced a peso depreciation in recent weeks; interest rate rose somewhat, and sovereign
debt spreads peaked at nearly 400 basis points in mid September. Deposits, however,
remained stable; rates and spreads have fallen from their peaks but remain mostly at higher
levels than a few weeks ago.

Supported by high commodity prices, export growth remains strong. Exports
earnings continued to increase (merchandise exports were up almost 50 percent in the first
quarter of 2008), despite some deceleration in volume growth. The beginning of operation of
the Botnia pulp mill has contributed to the strong export performance, with the positive effect
on GDP this year estimated at 2½ percentage points. Higher oil imports—resulting from high
prices and a drought—and rapidly growing imports of capital goods have largely offset the
impact of strong agricultural commodity prices on the trade balance.

5

However, with the run up in commodity prices, underlying inflationary
10

pressures have been high. Inflation
(Jan 2007-Jul 2008, annual percentage)
has increased from less than 4 percent

since end-2007. These rates are above

5.
The authorities have tightened monetary policy while taking administrative
measures to contain price increases. The central bank increased the policy rate by
275 basis points to 7¼ percent in 2007 and has left it broadly unchanged so far in 2008. More
recently, in May, it raised reserve requirements for peso deposits from 17 to 25 percent, and
for foreign-currency deposits from 25 to 35 percent. It also allowed the exchange-rate
channel to operate more freely than before, with the peso appreciating against the U.S. dollar
by about 19 percent since July 2007. In addition, in 2007, the authorities implemented
administrative measures, including tariff cuts, to prevent headline inflation from reaching
double-digits last year, which would have triggered more frequent pension and wage
adjustments. The fiscal cost of these measures, which reduced headline inflation by
1.5 percentage points in 2007/08, is estimated at 1¾ percent of GDP.

While the overall deficit has been below target, fiscal spending has been
expansionary, particularly in non-drought years. The primary balance declined from
3.8 percent of GDP in 2006 to an estimated 2.7 percent of GDP in 2008, and is projected to
increase to above 3 percent of GDP in 2009. Still, with lower interest payments, the overall
deficit is expected to remain between 0–0.3 percent of GDP, below the authorities’ medium
targets adopted in 2005. Also, the gross debt-to-GDP ratio has continued to fall, to below
70 percent of GDP; net of NIR, the debt stands at 55 percent of GDP. However, the recovery

II. OUTLOOK AND CHALLENGES
8.
Barring a severe further external deterioration, growth prospects remain strong.
Following the one-off effect of the start of operations of the Botnia pulp mill, growth is
expected to slow to about 5½ percent in 2009. The medium-term outlook remains positive,
with major foreign investments in the tradable sector—among others, ENCE is proceeding
with its plans for another pulp mill and the Portuguese company Portucel recently announced
a major investment in the sector.
9.
Vulnerabilities have declined considerably, but remain important. With lower
public debt ratios, high reserve coverage of dollar-denominated deposits, and vigorous
growth momentum, Uruguay has built significant buffers to external shocks. Over the past
years, short-term government debt has fallen substantially (although the 1–3 year maturity
central bank debt has risen owing to sterilization) and government external financing needs
are covered through 2009. Until end-2009, debt totaling only US$542 million is maturing,
US$128 million of which is in local markets – if the sovereign were to be completely shut off
from both local and international markets, it could in principle finance itself through the
beginning of 2010. Nevertheless, gross public debt remains high by emerging market
standards, and mostly denominated in foreign currency. Financial dollarization has declined
but, at about 75 percent of both loans and deposits, is among the highest in the world
(Figure 4).
A. Dealing with High Inflation and Capital Inflows
10.
Both external and domestic factors have played a role in pushing up prices. Food
inflation of 14 percent and fuel and electricity price increases of 13 percent have led headline
inflation since mid-2007. Staff analysis suggests that international food prices have
contributed 2–2.5 percentage points to headline inflation (Box 1). At the same time, output is
above potential, and domestic pressures are visible in high inflation of nontradable goods
(7.7 percent). Fiscal policy has not helped in containing demand; while the precise effect is
difficult to quantify, staff estimated that a 1 percent of GDP fiscal stimulus tends to raise
inflation by about 0.7 percentage points after 6 months (see IMF Occasional Paper 263).
11.
Moreover, there are indications
of further inflationary pressures. High
core inflation (9–10 percent) and limited
increases in controlled prices
(2–3 percent) point to upward pressures
for headline inflation. The diffusion
index (DI) confirms that inflation has
permeated to most consumption items. In
this context, inflation expectations are at
8.0 percent for this year but declining to

Food price shocks have had a significant impact on headline inflation. Econometric
analysis based on vector autoregressive estimations and confirmed by an “augmented”

While strong demand by the agricultural and manufacturing sectors has been the main driver
of credit growth, banks have also diversified into consumer and mortgage lending.
15.
However, profitability has declined despite high economic growth. The average
return on assets has dropped to 1.0 percent (from 1.7 percent a year ago), with some banks
now registering losses, owing to: (i) declining yields on foreign assets; and (ii) peso
appreciation, which raised peso costs relative to earnings on dollar assets. Moreover, the
recent increase in unremunerated reserve requirements will further compress profits;
persistent low profitability could lead to a relaxation of lending standards in search of higher
yields.

Nonresident deposits have recently risen but their share in total deposits has
remained broadly stable. While increasing by some US$200 million during the first half of
the year, nonresident deposits have remained at about 15 percent of total deposits, half their
level prior to 2002. Vulnerabilities are much reduced, but medium term risks persist given
their still considerable levels and past high volatility; risks would be higher if over time
banks were to use these deposits to finance domestic credit.

Stress testing by SIIF appropriately accounts for the main
intermediation risks, including exchange rate, interest rate and
credit risk. Currently, under all but extreme scenarios, banks’ capital
adequacy ratio would remain above required levels in all banks.

The regulatory framework needs to be improved further to deal with the risks associated
with the rapid credit expansion. Capital adequacy should be better aligned with indirect credit
risk by differentiating the weight on foreign currency loans used in determining risk-adjusted
assets between unhedged and hedged borrowers. While banks are not intermediating the
potentially volatile non-resident deposits in the local economy, the SIIF could reduce such risk by
establishing internal, bank-specific liquidity benchmarks (beyond those contained in prudential
norms) against which institutions are assessed.

17.
The main effect of a sustained “sudden stop” for corporate financing would
likely come through a weakening of balance sheets through the exchange rate channel.
Uruguayan corporations’ main source of financing are internal funds, followed by suppliers’
credit and bank lending. Neither local corporate bond nor stock markets are important, the
use of foreign credit lines is negligible, and there have been no bond placements by
Uruguayan corporations abroad. In the case of a sustained ‘sudden stop’, domestic bank
lending growth would decelerate, and, more importantly, any exchange rate depreciation
would weaken balance sheets of non-exporting companies indebted in foreign currency and
reduce their access to bank finance. The weakening of balance sheets in turn, would raise
credit risk for banks.
C. Regional Links
18.
Despite reduced linkages with Argentina and Brazil, conditions in the region
have a significant bearing on developments in Uruguay. While trade has been
significantly diversified away from the region, Uruguay’s linkages remain considerable. In
particular, Argentina and Brazil are among Uruguay’s largest trading partners; non resident
deposits remain considerable; and, importantly, links through investment in agriculture,
construction, and real estate have increased in recent years.
19.
Nevertheless, the Uruguayan economy could weather a drop in regional growth.
Econometric estimates suggest that,

co-movement with Brazil and other
emerging markets but decoupling
with the recent spike in the spreads for Argentina. That said, a more severe shock, such as
one leading to a contraction in regional GDP; or a continued deterioration in the global
financial environment would, directly, and indirectly, affect Uruguay significantly.

18

Box 4. External Linkages and the Changing Global Environment1
A Bayesian VAR model suggests that growth in Uruguay is sensitive to the performance of trading
partners, the Latin American EMBI spread, the US interest rate, and the terms of trade. A one standard
deviation shock, equivalent to: (i) a 1 percent deceleration in trading partners’ growth would reduce
growth in Uruguay by ½ percentage point; (ii) a 180bps increase in the spreads would reduce growth by
about ½ percent point; (iii) a 50 bps increase in the US interest rate would reduce growth by ½ percentage
point; and (iv) a 4 percent fall in ToT would reduce growth by 0.3 percentage points.
Benchmark: In the absence of shocks, the model forecasts growth of about 7.5 percent in 2008, slowing
to 6 percent by 2010. This would be supported by strong growth in trading partners (3.8 percent on
average) and relatively low EMBILA spreads (about 320 bps on average). Alternative scenarios:
Asymmetric commodity price shock (chart): Uruguay would not be particularly vulnerable to a
generalized fall in commodity prices, as the lower agricultural export prices would be offset by lower oil
import prices. However, a more pronounced fall in agriculture prices, would impact Uruguay both through
its ToT and its regional trading partners with similar export structure. A 7 percent average fall in ToT and
1.6 percent lower growth in trading partners would reduce growth by 2.5 percent by 2010.
Financial shock: A 100bps higher US interest rate and a 250bps EMBILA spread increase over the
medium term would reduce growth by 2.2 percentage points by 2010.
Regional slowdown: A regional slowdown, equivalent to 3 percent lower GDP growth in Argentina and
Brazil, coupled with higher risk aversion reflected in an EMBI spread of about 600bps—would result in a
slowdown of close to 2 percentage points by 2010.

III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
A. The External Environment
20.
The authorities stressed that Uruguay was well-prepared to weather a
deterioration in the regional or global environment, with increased diversification of
export destinations and reduced financial links with the region. Moreover, Uruguay had only
indirectly benefited from high commodity prices as its terms of trade had not improved
during the last few years. While they shared staff’s view that a severe financial crisis or a
pronounced regional slowdown would not leave Uruguay unaffected, they explained that
they were prepared to face such an adverse shock. In particular, they stressed that the
significant FDI inflows would likely continue and pointed to the health and ample liquidity
of the financial system, the absence of near-term financing requirements, and their readiness
to lower expenditures should revenues fall below expectations.
21.
With a relatively high level of reserves, there is scope for reserve asset
diversification to better insure against external shocks. Staff research suggests that there
is scope for Uruguay to further reduce risks by acquiring financial instruments that provide
hedging against large negative shocks—i.e., instruments that are correlated with shocks to
the Uruguayan economy and those of its big neighbors, such as exchange traded funds (cattle
or oil), VIX, or MSCI indices, so that reserves would tend to increase when they are needed
the most. The authorities welcomed the ideas in principle and indicated that they would be
interested in insurance mechanisms, including possibly through hedging against oil price
fluctuations at the state oil company.
B. Monetary Policy
22.
The authorities shared staff’s concern about inflation. However, they stressed that
inflationary pressures were a worldwide
12-month ahead expected inflation and
target bands for Aug 2009 annual inflation (percent)

prices. They noted that inflation and inflation

23.
Further monetary tightening would help bring inflation expectations back to
well within the target range. Staff took the view that there was scope for an interest rate
hike of at least 100 basis points, given the strength of the economy. The authorities pointed
out that monetary policy aimed at striking a delicate balance between containing inflation
and, until recently, avoiding an excessive appreciation of the peso. Moreover, they noted that
world prices were unlikely to continue exerting pressure on domestic prices; and that efforts
to contain upcoming wage increases, which would be guided by forward-looking inflation,
would also help limit second-round effects and dampen inflation dynamics. Nevertheless,
they indicated that they did not rule out a further interest rate hike, depending on a further
assessment of inflation developments in the next few months.
24.
Staff cautioned against further reliance on administrative measures to contain
prices. Tax exemptions and similar measures typically have a one-off effect on the price
level without addressing underlying pressures, often with expansionary implications and
permanent fiscal costs. The authorities stressed that by avoiding triggering biannual pensions
adjustments (Text Table 1) inflation expectations had been dampened, avoiding undesirable
inflation dynamics and substantial additional fiscal outlays. However, the authorities
regarded such measures as exceptional.
25.
Reduced foreign exchange intervention would enhance the effectiveness of
monetary policy. According to several measures, the REER was slightly undervalued
(Box 2) prior to the events of recent global financial turmoil. Moreover, likely productivity
improvements in the tradable sector, should ease concerns about reduced foreign exchange
intervention. Staff stressed that reduced intervention, under the current managed float regime,
would help contain one-sided bets on the exchange rate.
26.
The mission encouraged the authorities to focus on the interest rate as a
monetary instrument rather than on

authorities emphasized that both the hike
in reserve requirements on peso and dollar
deposits helped contain domestic demand pressures stemming from dollar lending, which
was not affected by the peso policy rate; and viewed the measure as a way to prevent an
increase in capital inflows. The authorities agreed, however, that changes in reserve
requirements should not be used as a regular policy tool.

C. Fiscal policy
27.
A tighter fiscal stance would help reduce the burden on monetary policy. Staff
advocated more ambitious fiscal targets by a cumulative 1½ percent of GDP during 2008-09
to avoid adding pressures on domestic demand and reduce the burden on monetary policy in
its efforts to reduce inflation. With likely higher revenues owing to strong growth, and
without drought-related spending in 2009, this seems feasible and could be achieved by
containing current expenditures, and reducing non-priority capital spending. The authorities
noted that fiscal performance was already strong by historical standards and questioned the
impact that fiscal policy could have on inflation. Staff pointed to empirical evidence to this
effect (see ¶10).
28.
Staff supported the authorities’ efforts to protect the vulnerable, and
encouraged them to concentrate further on well targeted subsidies. Staff took the view
that, while there is clearly need to alleviate the effects of shocks on the poor, measures to
prevent price increases generally are generally costly. The authorities agreed, pointing out
that their efforts are in the proposed direction, including a recent program for poor families
that temporarily grants an electronic card to purchase priority goods.
29.
The credibility of the framework would be enhanced by aiming at cyclically
adjusted fiscal targets. The medium term projections assume a broadly constant fiscal
deficit target of about 0.1 percent of GDP, implying a primary surplus of 2½-3 percent of
GDP. While high growth is facilitating the achievement of such targets, gross public sector
debt of about 40 percent of GDP by 2013 would still be above levels regarded as safe for
emerging market economies. A more ambitious medium term fiscal target, by say, 1–1½
percentage points of GDP, in a framework that allows countercyclical policies, would help
fiscal policy become more effective and reduce public debt faster to 30–35 percent of GDP.
Officials considered the current targets as appropriately balancing different objectives but
broadly agreed with the desirability to moving to a countercyclical policy rule in the future.
D. Financial Sector: Safeguarding Stability
30.
While the financial system appears sound, even in the current context of global
instability, staff recommended tackling

22
current credit expansion. Still, staff recommended benchmarking bank liquidity against a
minimum ratio of disposable liquid assets to deposits to minimize potential risks. With a
view to promoting gradual de-dollarization, staff proposed to differentiate between unhedged
and hedged borrowers when determining risk-adjusted assets. The authorities welcomed
these proposals, but considered that further study was needed before making decisions.
31.
Regulations specifying legal powers of bank supervisors could be improved. Staff
pointed out that, as recommended by the 2006 FSAP, prudential procedures could spell out
specific measures to deal with cases of capital insufficiency. The formal powers of
supervisors in dealing with state banks, notably direct intervention measures, need to be
further strengthened and the appointment of state banks’ directors should be subject to fitand-proper criteria. While broadly agreeing, bank supervisors noted that in the recent past
they have been able to deal with non-compliant state banks through administrative measures.
E. Structural Reforms and the Business Climate
32.
The authorities expect the financial sector reform to be passed soon. The draft bill
––including the changes in the supervisory and bank resolution framework––is likely to
remain largely unchanged, except for the provision to de-link the central bank’s board’s term
from the electoral cycle, which would not be included due to lack of political consensus.
Staff stressed the importance of making price stability the primary objective of the central
bank; and regretted the likely changes to the appointment of Directors, which had been a key
element for strengthening central bank independence. The authorities emphasized that, even
without this element, the reform implied a significant institutional advancement.
33.
Progress is also expected on various pending reforms. Following the approval of
the competition law, the bankruptcy law is expected to be voted by Congress soon. Similarly,
the authorities believe that by December, Congress will likely consider the reform of the
pension funds for the police and for banking employees. Progress on the reform of the
housing bank, BHU, has now gained momentum with the appointment of a new board of
directors, the submission of a business plan to the Bank Superintendency, and the start of the
personnel transfers from BHU. The bad loan portfolio is expected to be separated by
November. The authorities agreed that, with housing agency in charge of housing policy,
BHU should only resume lending on commercial terms.
34.
Despite further improvements in the investment climate, some concerns remain.
The new investment office has been working well, attending an increasing number of
requests. The large FDI inflows are evidence that Uruguay is an attractive place for
investment. While Uruguay’s business climate ranks highest in Latin America according to a
key survey, Uruguay does not fare as well in other worldwide comparisons, partly due to
perceptions of a still slow and cumbersome bureaucracy. Moreover, entrepreneurs remain
concerned about aspects of labor legislation, such as the law on subcontracting (which partly
makes the company liable for labor law violations by subcontracting firms).

23
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
Uruguay has continued to make important economic strides, and the effects of
the recent global financial turmoil have been relatively contained. Based on sound
policies, growth has been vigorous, and the authorities have taken advantage of favorable
conditions to reduce vulnerabilities. Strong foreign investment, coupled with key structural
reforms, have helped raise productivity and modernize the economy. Barring a severe
deterioration of global or regional prospects, Uruguay seems much better positioned than in
the past to weather the current financial instability, with high reserves, no financing needs
through end-2009, and substantial financial system liquidity. Nevertheless, with still
significant medium term vulnerabilities and linkages with the rest of the world, close
monitoring of conditions in Uruguay and its financial system is warranted in the current
environment.
36.
Inflation, however, has remained a challenge and requires further monetary
tightening. As in many countries around the world, inflation pressures have been high.
Lowering inflation to single digit levels has been a significant achievement in Uruguay that
needs to be protected. It is important for fostering private investment, protecting vulnerable
segments of society, and reducing vulnerabilities. In light of persistently high core inflation
and low real interest rates, a tighter monetary stance would be required to ensure that
inflation returns to well within the target range.
37.
At least until recently, the challenge was compounded by strong capital inflows,
underlining the need for further exchange rate flexibility. Containing peso appreciation
while raising interest rates can exacerbate capital inflows by encouraging one-way bets, and
lead to a further build-up of central bank debt—due to sterilized intervention—and associated
quasi-fiscal costs. The trend of FDI- related capital inflows is likely to persist, provided
global financial conditions stabilize.
38.
The authorities’ commitment to their overall fiscal targets is commendable but a
tighter fiscal stance, particularly in 2009, would help bring inflation down. The
authorities’ fiscal efforts in 2008, even while facing substantial drought-related revenue
losses and implementing measures to protect the population from higher food and fuel prices,
are welcome. Nevertheless, with expected high continued growth, and higher operating
surpluses by public enterprises, as they recover from the drought, fiscal targets could be more
ambitious, particularly in 2009. This would contribute to reducing domestic demand
pressures, thereby easing the burden on monetary policy.
39.
The adoption of cyclically adjusted and a stronger fiscal stance would also help
in further reducing medium term vulnerabilities. This would imply tighter targets in the
context of the currently vigorous growth, while facilitating the implementation of fiscal
stimulus when needed; help reduce debt to safer levels; and, enhance the credibility of fiscal
policy.

24
40.
The economy has built significant resilience to shocks in the last few years, but
shifting external conditions pose risks. Uruguay’s economy has become more diversified;
high central bank’s reserves and commercial banks’ liquidity provide important buffers
against a weakening of external conditions; and debt management operations have reduced
short term government financing needs and significantly improved the debt profile. That said,
the rapid increase in central bank debt implies some vulnerabilities. Moreover, given that
Uruguay is a small, open, and dollarized economy, a severe deterioration in the regional and
global outlook entail important risks.
41.
It is important that credit growth be accompanied by continued proactive bank
supervision to ensure that lending standards remain high. Financial regulation appears
adequate to contain near-term risks derived from credit growth and from non resident
deposits, but continued vigilance is needed. While banking system liquidity is still
significant, the current high growth of bank lending, if sustained over time, could risk
deterioration in the quality of banks’ assets.
42.
The authorities’ determination to press ahead with the pending structural
agenda is commendable. The approval of the competition law and expected approval of the
bankruptcy law are steps that should further enhance the business environment. In particular,
the authorities’ expectation that the financial reform of the central bank charter, financial
sector supervision, and the bank resolution framework, are likely to be passed this year, is
encouraging. The intention not to de-link the terms of central bank board directors from the
political cycle is, however, unfortunate. Progress in restructuring BHU is welcome and
should be sustained. It is also positive that the pension reforms of the police and of bank
employees are expected to be approved this year.
43.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Uruguay take place on
the standard 12-month cycle.

2/ Framework covers the public sector and central bank issued debt (net of free reserves).
3/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of
foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
4/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 3/ as r - p (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
5/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 3/ as ae(1+r).
6/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
7/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
8/ The key variables include real GDP growth and primary balance in percent of GDP.

(e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows
in percent of GDP) remain at of the last projection year.

When a member has overdue financial obligations outstanding for more than three months, the amount of
such arrears will be shown in this section.

VII. Safeguards Assessment. The authorities are in the process of addressing all
safeguards concerns raised in the safeguards assessment completed in September 2005, and
have already implemented many of the recommendations proposed by staff. Uruguay's total
obligations to the Fund are now included in the BCU's financial statements and the criteria
for the selection and appointment of the BCU's external audit firm have been amended in line
with the safeguards recommendation.

3
VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangement. The currency is the Uruguayan peso (Ur$). Uruguay
has followed an independently floating exchange rate regime since July 29, 2002. In April
2006, Uruguay’s de facto exchange rate regime was reclassified from an independent float to
a managed float with no predetermined path for the exchange rate. On September 4, 2008,
the exchange rate in the official market was Ur$ 19.359 per US dollar. Uruguay’s exchange
system is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions.
The exchange restriction associated with the reprogramming of time deposits at BROU and
BHU during the 2002 crisis was removed ahead of schedule in April 2005.
IX.
Article IV Consultation. The 2007 Article IV consultation was concluded by the
Executive Board on August 29, 2007 (Country Report No. 08/45). Uruguay is on the

July 15, 2002.

XI.
FSAP participation and ROSCs. The Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA)
was considered by the Executive Board on June 28, 2006 (Country Report No. 06/187). The
ROSC-module on fiscal transparency was published on March 5, 2001. A ROSC-module on
data dissemination practices was published on October 18, 2001. The ROSC on Anti-Money
Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) was published on
December 2006 (Country Report No. 06/435)
XII. Technical Assistance. Technical assistance on tax, customs, and social security
administration was provided by FAD in February 2007, March 2006, June 2005, and July
2003, on tax policy in October 2005 and May 2003, and on public financial management in
March 2005 and July 2006. In April 2003, STA provided technical assistance on adequate
recording of loans funded by the FSBS. MCM has been providing substantial and continuous
technical assistance since 2002 in the resolution of intervened banks, the restructuring of the
public bank BROU, and recently on BHU, and in July 2005 jointly with ICM on debt
management. Further, MCM has also provided technical assistance to strengthen the
formulation and conduct of monetary and exchange rate policies, including in July 2006 and
May 2007. In February 2007, LEG provided technical assistance to develop a framework to
elaborate and implement a national AML/CFT strategy consistent with the recommendations
of the Fund’s 2005 AML/CFT assessment report.
XIII. Resident Representative. Mr. Gaston Gelos. The Resident Representative now covers
Uruguay from the Buenos Aires’ office.

ANNEX II. RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of July 24, 2008)
The latest Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Uruguay was approved on June 9, 2005.
The CAS envisaged a base case scenario of up to US$800 million in new lending over the
period FY05–10, modulated on the strength of the Government’s program, its ability to
implement it and the evolution in the country’s creditworthiness. The 2005 CAS also
proposed to rebuild the investment portfolio with new operations supporting priority
investments in infrastructure, social programs and innovation.
The Bank’s strategy outlined in the 2005 CAS was anchored around a series of
programmatic development loans (DPLs) supporting the Government in key policy areas.
The first DPL (DPL1) for US$75 million was approved by the Board of Directors together
with the CAS on June 9, 2005. It supported reforms in social policies as well as important
measures taken by the Government with respect to health, education and social protection.
A subsequent DPL, the First Programmatic Reform Implementation Development Policy
Loan (PRIDPL 1) in the amount of US$100 million, was approved by the Board of
Directors on May 30, 2007. This operation supported the Government’s reform program in
taxation, business climate and capital markets development, and aimed at improving the
social protection system. The US$100 million PRIDPL1 was disbursed in local currency in
May 2008, as the World Bank became the first foreign issuer to launch a public bond in
(inflation indexed) Uruguayan pesos. This was the first that the World Bank has issued a
local currency bond for the purpose of a back-to-back disbursement of a specific loan.
The current investment portfolio comprises nine projects totaling US$267.9 million in
commitments, with an undisbursed amount of US$176.1 million as of July 24, 2008. Seven
of these investment operations have been approved since the beginning of the new CAS
period. These include two investment operations for Integrated Natural Resources and
Transport Infrastructure and Rural Access, in the amount of US$30 million and
US$70 million respectively, approved by the Board on June 9, 2005 together with the CAS.
In addition, in December 2006, the Board approved a Supplemental Financing for the Foot
and Mouth Disease Project in the amount of US$6.5 million. On May 30, 2007 an
Institution Building Technical Assistance Project in the amount of US$15 million was also
approved (together with the First PRIDPL). In addition, the second phase of an Adaptable
Program Loan (APL) for OSE Modernization and Rehabilitation Systems (US$50 million)
was approved on July 28, 2007. Another investment loan in support of the Promoting
Innovation to Enhance Competitiveness Project was approved on May 1, 2007 in the
amount of US$26 million, and a Non Communicable Disease Prevention Project in the
amount of US$25.30 million was approved on August 28, 2008.
A CAS Progress Report (PR) to assess progress in implementing the program outlined in
the 2005 CAS, take stock of achievements and lay out a program for the remainder of the

5
CAS period (FY08-FY10) was approved on April 1, 2008. The CAS PR confirms the
validity of the overall thrust and long-term goals of the 2005 CAS. It also notes that the
Bank program has achieved substantial success over the last two years, particularly in basic
education, health, rural development, transport, water and sewerage, and innovation. The
CAS PR recognizes the important economic developments that have taken place since the
2005 CAS was approved, most notably Uruguay’s full recovery from the 2002 crisis and its
marked progress in economic growth and fiscal outcomes, which have outperformed 2005
CAS projections. Given these positive developments, country requirements, as outlined in
the CAS PR, have evolved within the CAS framework, with an increased interest in the
Bank’s technical inputs and contribution to improving results, and a reduction in financing
needs, largely due to debt-reprofiling.
Because of the lower than anticipated financing needs, the Second Programmatic Reform
Implementation Development Policy Loan (PRIDPL2), originally envisaged for FY07
under the 2005 CAS, has been postponed to FY08. The authorities also decided to combine
PRIDPL2 and PRIDPL3 (for a combined amount of US$100 million under the 2005 CAS)
into a single operation for US$300 million with a DDO (Deferred Drawdown Option). A
DPL DDO provides the option of deferring loan disbursement for up to three years from
loan signing and is renewable for an additional three years, thereby creating a contingency
form of financing for Uruguay over an extended period of time. The possibility of an
increase in the CAS envelope by up to US$60 million was included in the CAS PR to
accommodate the larger amount under this new operation, which is currently at an advanced
stage of preparation and it is scheduled for Board consideration in the first quarter of FY09.
The Bank has also engaged with the authorities in an active AAA program. In FY08, the
program has included completion of a Programmatic DPR in Infrastructure, a PSIA on Tax
Reform, an Investment Climate Assessment and a Non-Lending Technical Assistance
(NLTA) on Strengthening Participatory Monitoring and Evaluation in Social Policies. A
Railways Sector Study, second phase of the NLTA on Participatory Monitoring and
Evaluation, and an NLTA on Human Development Reforms are underway for FY09
completion. A Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) focusing on trade is also planned
for FY09.

ANNEX III. RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of July 23, 2008)
The Inter-American Development Board of Executive Directors approved a new Country
Strategy for Uruguay on March 15, 2006. The Bank’s Country Strategy supports the
Government’s policy, which seeks to consolidate growth and improve the population’s social
welfare. In support of this longer-term goal, the Strategy focuses on the following priority
areas: (i) improving public sector management, to increase its efficiency and efficacy, while
supporting fiscal and debt sustainability; (ii) enhancing regional and international
competitiveness of domestic output and encouraging private investment in order to promote
sustainable growth; and (iii) reducing poverty and increasing social inclusion.
The implementation of the Bank’s strategy proposes a likely lending scenario of about
US$1.2 million for the five-year period 2005–09, which is consistent with Uruguay’s fiveyear budget plan, annual amendments approved by Congress, and the maintenance of a
relatively neutral net flow of Bank resources (during this period of concentrated external-IFImaturities). This program includes lending to support the Government in the key policy areas
of competitiveness, the social sectors and poverty reduction, and public sector management.
To this end, within the area of competitiveness, a loan for a program to support the
productivity and development of new livestock products, for US$15.8 million, was approved
in July 2005; an investment project to improve cluster competitiveness for US$9 million was
approved in July 2006; and a two-year programmatic loan to improve competitiveness for a
total of US$150 million––for US$75 million each––is under preparation, with the first loan
approved in January 2007 and expected approval of the second loan in March 2009; and a
loan to strengthen the institutional capacity for international insertion, for US$5.4 million
was approved in April 2008. In the social sector area, a sector loan, for US$250 million, was
approved in August 2005, to support the development and implementation of Government’s
social policy aimed at reducing poverty, improving the human resource base among the poor,
and strengthening the sector’s institutional framework; and a loan for sanitation, for
US$118.6 million, was approved in January 2006, to improve the standard of living of the
population in Montevideo by increasing the coverage of sanitation service and reducing
pollution in the bay; and a neighborhood improvement program for US$70 million is
expected to be approved in end-2008.
Within the public sector management area, a loan to support the public debt management unit
for US$2.45 million was approved in November 2005; and a three year programmatic loan to
support improvements in tax administration and public sector management is being prepared.
The first loan for US$50 million was approved in October 2006; a second loan for an
estimated US$100 million is likely to be approved in early-2009 while the amount for the
third loan is to be determined; a program related to e-government management for US$5
million was approved in March 2008. The lending program also includes investment projects

8
with new operations planned in the area of microfinance, to support transport infrastructure,
and social programs.
As of July 23, 2008 the Bank’s current portfolio in Uruguay includes loans for the financing
of 22 investment projects; and two policy based operations, for the social sectors and for
improvements in competitiveness. The lending portfolio, which is largely aligned to the
administration’s priorities and consistent with the Bank’s Country Strategy, amounts to
US$1,037.0 million, of which US$540.6 million are pending disbursement. Portfolio
performance related to investment loans in 2007 was relatively normal. PBL disbursements,
however, slowed due to a robust fiscal performance and ample availability of market
financing (most notably, the release of the Social Sector Loan, US$125 million, and the
Programmatic Competitiveness Loan I, US$75M, scheduled for release in the first half of
2007 is now expected in late 2008/early 2009). The Bank’s Operational Program for 2008
contemplates programmatic and investment projects and TCs bundled in a diversified
instrument mix that includes CCLIPs to underpin a longer term commitment with the
country. While work is well advanced, advancing project preparation and approval during
2008 would be desirable in anticipation of the electoral process culminating with the October
2009 presidential elections.

ANNEX IV. URUGUAY: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Uruguay’s economic and financial database is generally adequate for the assessment and
monitoring of macroeconomic policies. Uruguay subscribed to the SDDS in February 2004,
and meets the SDDS specifications. However, Uruguay uses the flexibility option for
timeliness of central and general government operations, and the analytical accounts of the
banking sector.
Real sector statistics
National accounts statistics have a number of shortcomings, including the use of an outdated
benchmark year (1983), limited coverage of the enterprise survey, long publication lags,
inadequate information on the informal economy, and incomplete quarterly accounts. The
central bank (BCU) compiles and disseminates annual GDP estimates in current and constant
prices by the production and expenditure approaches, as well as quarterly constant price GDP
estimates by the production and expenditure approaches. Gross national income, gross
disposable income and gross savings are also available annually. A STA multisector mission
in November 1999 recommended a range of improvements including completing work on
revision of data and methods that had already been initiated, introduction of annually chained
volume measures, incorporation of new benchmark survey data, and compilation of quarterly
estimates of GDP at current prices.
Both the consumer and wholesale price indices are reported on a regular and timely basis for
publication in the IFS. The consumer price index has a base period of March 1997 = 100, and
the base of the wholesale price index has been updated to 2001. Coverage of the CPI is
limited to the capital city. The authorities do not provide trade price and volume indices for
publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS).
Government finance statistics
Official data on the central administration, the state enterprises and the social security system
are complete and current, but there are problems with the timeliness of the data on local
governments. There are also problems with the timeliness of financing and debt data reported
for inclusion in the Fund’s statistical publications. Information on a monthly and quarterly
basis for financing and debt data respectively, are disseminated on the BCU website
from 1999 onwards for the central government and total public sector. The information
reported for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook covers transactions
on revenue and expense for the consolidated central government, and the general
government’s operations on financial assets and liabilities, both in terms of flows (financing)
and stocks (debt). However, data on revenue and expense for local governments have not
been reported since 1994.

10
Monetary and financial statistics
Monetary and financial statistics are prepared in accordance with the IMF's Monetary and
Financial Statistics Manual (2000). Authorities have yet to report monetary data using the
standardized reporting forms (SRF). In April 2003, an STA mission visited Montevideo to
assist the authorities in the adequate recording of the loans funded from the Fund for the
Stabilization of the Banking System (FSBS) in the Central Bank’s balance sheet. The
mission’s recommendations have been implemented and were reflected in the IFS June 2003
issue.
External sector statistics
Balance of payments statements are compiled and published on a quarterly basis. Data are
compiled following the recommendations of the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments
Manual (BPM5). Uruguay compiles and reports to STA quarterly data on balance of
payments and annual data on the international investment position (IIP) for publication in the
IFS and the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook. The new surveys would also allow for
improved coverage of the private sector in the IIP.
Uruguay started disseminating the international reserves and foreign currency liquidity data
template on the Fund’s external website in 2005 The BCU also disseminates quarterly
external debt statistics on its website, although not in the format envisaged by the SDDS.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
October 22, 2008
1.
This statement reports on developments in Uruguay since the Staff Report was
issued on October 9. Although downside side risks have increased, the thrust of the staff
appraisal remains unchanged.
2.
The intensification of international financial market turbulence has been felt in
Uruguay. Bond prices have fallen, pressures on the peso have persisted, and country risk has
shot up to around 550 basis points. Still, despite limited intervention, since October 1 the
currency has depreciated by 3.4 percent and gross reserves have declined modestly from
US$6.40 billion to US$6.20 billion. Bank deposits have remained stable.
3.
Pressures on the peso lessened after the central bank tightened banks’ liquidity
in early October. It raised its target rate by 50 basis points to 7.75 percent and the interest
rate on its Lombard facility from 10 to 20 percent; and, closed the one-day financing facility.
As a result, and with banks seeking to purchase dollars, interbank rates have shot up,
temporarily reaching around 30 percent.
4.
Median survey inflation expectations for end-2008 have risen to 8.5 percent,
compared to 8 percent in September. For end-2009, inflation expectations remained
broadly stable at about 7 percent.
5.
Economic activity is slowing. Non-refinery manufacturing output rose 5.3 percent in
August, compared to 13.1 percent in July (year-on-year).
6.
The Portuguese company Portucel confirmed plans for a new large-scale
investment project in Uruguay. The company intends to build a pulp and paper mill in the
eastern part of the country, as well as a sea port; total investment is estimated at more than
US$4 billion.
7.
The central bank reform was approved by the Senate. Approval by the Lower
House is expected to occur before end-October. The draft law also reforms financial
supervision and the banking resolution framework.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
Uruguay
On October, 24, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Uruguay. 1
Background
Uruguay has further consolidated economic gains, supported by strong macroeconomic policies
and a broadly favorable external environment. Growth has exceeded expectations,
unemployment has reached record lows and poverty has continued to fall, while economic
vulnerabilities have been significantly reduced. Nevertheless, persistent inflationary pressures,
together with a deteriorating global economy pose key challenges. Moreover, despite significant
advances, the government’s reform agenda is still ongoing. Since the intensification of the
global financial turbulence, Uruguay has experienced a peso-depreciation, higher interest rates,
and an increase in country risk.
Real GDP grew by 7.5 percent in 2007, continuing the strong performance following the crisis in
2002. Growth momentum has been exceptionally strong this year, with real GDP growth
reaching 13 percent during the first semester, led by domestic demand. Together with food and
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
oil commodity prices increases, this has fueled persistent inflationary pressures. Twelve-month
inflation through September 2008 was 7.5 percent, above the upper limit of the central bank’s
target range (7 percent). Core inflation has risen steadily, and remains in the 9-10 percent
range.
The authorities took measures to contain price increases, but pressures remain. The policy rate
was raised by 275 basis points to 7¼ percent in 2007 and, more recently by 50 basis points in
October; in May, reserve requirements were increased. Moreover, the exchange-rate channel
has been allowed to operate more freely, with, until this September, the peso appreciating
against the U.S. dollar. In addition, in 2007, tax measures were implemented to prevent
headline inflation from reaching double-digits, which would have triggered more frequent
pension and wage adjustments. Nonetheless, while headline inflation has come down by 1½
percentage points since its peak in 2007, both core and headline inflation remain above the
central bank’s target range.
While the overall deficit has been below target, fiscal policy has been somewhat expansionary.
The headline primary balance declined from 3¾ percent of GDP in 2006 to an estimated
2.7 percent of GDP in 2008. Adjusting for the economic cycle and excluding drought-related
costs, both the primary and overall balances may imply a positive impulse in 2008–09. Still, with
lower interest payments, the overall deficit is expected to remain between 0-0.3 percent of GDP.
Moreover, the gross debt-to-GDP ratio has continued to fall, to about 65 percent of GDP and
55 percent of GDP (net of Net International Reserves - NIR). Nonetheless, looking ahead, more
ambitious fiscal targets would help ease domestic demand pressures and reduce the burden on
monetary policy in its fight against inflation, as well as help in achieving faster debt reduction.
Uruguay’s external sector remains strong, with buoyant exports, and import growth driven by
large foreign direct investment projects. The central bank has accumulated US$6 billion in
reserves to date. Short-term debt has been sharply reduced through debt management
operations, including by de-dollarizing through swaps with support from the World Bank. The
debt structure has improved, and financing needs are covered through end-2009.
Financial indicators have improved considerably. Despite strong credit growth, financial system
soundness indicators have improved, showing a well-capitalized banking system, low nonperforming-loan ratios and high liquidity levels. However, bank profitability has declined of late
reflecting in part declining yields and the strong peso appreciation until August. Still, Uruguay
remains one of the most dollarized economies in the world.

Despite significant advances, various structural reforms are still pending. Progress has
been made in restructuring the housing bank BHU, but the process remains to be
completed.

3
Executive Board Assessment
The Executive Directors noted that prudent macroeconomic policies and deep-rooted structural
reforms over the past few years, aided by favorable external conditions until mid-2008, have
enabled Uruguay to maintain vigorous export and economic growth, lower unemployment and
poverty rates, and significantly reduce vulnerability to shocks. High levels of international
reserves and commercial bank liquidity are providing important buffers against deteriorating
external conditions. Moreover, debt management operations have reduced short-term
government financing needs, lowered the debt-to-GDP ratio, and substantially improved the
debt profile. As a result, the effects of the recent turmoil in global financial markets have been
relatively contained.
Notwithstanding these achievements, Directors noted that the Uruguayan economy remains
vulnerable. In particular, deteriorating global financial and economic conditions pose downside
risks to Uruguay’s small, open, and dollarized economy. A main macroeconomic challenge will
be to contain inflation in the face of food and fuel price increases and domestic demand and
wage pressures. Directors also noted the recent sharp increase in Uruguay’s country risk
premium. They accordingly underlined the importance of continued vigilance by policymakers,
and of steadfast pursuit of the government’s reform agenda to help maintain macroeconomic
stability and sustain robust economic growth.
Directors welcomed the measures the authorities have taken to reduce inflationary pressures,
including increases in the policy rate and banks’ reserve requirements and tax administrative
measures. With core and headline inflation still above the central bank’s target range and bank
credit growing rapidly, Directors saw merit in some additional monetary tightening. A few
Directors cautioned, however, that reliance on the interest rate channel could intensify capital
inflows. Directors generally noted that administrative measures should be relied on to control
prices only in exceptional circumstances. Directors also emphasized the importance of making
price stability the core objective of monetary policy in order to strengthen the credibility of the
monetary policy framework, and of securing central bank independence irrespective of the
electoral cycle.
Directors noted that capital flows have complicated monetary management. Until August 2008,
strong inflows and sterilized intervention to contain the appreciation of the currency led to a
sharp rise in reserves and central bank debt. More recently, the deteriorating global financial
conditions have created new challenges, as inflows have abated and the exchange rate has
depreciated.
Most Directors considered that fiscal policy has been expansionary, particularly in non-drought
years. They noted that the primary balance has deteriorated since 2006, and the structural
primary and overall balances may imply a positive impulse in 2008-09. Directors stressed that,

4
with the gross public debt ratio still relatively high, it will be essential to maintain high primary
surpluses to further reduce the debt burden. Most Directors encouraged the authorities to
maintain an ambitious fiscal stance to help avoid increasing the burden on monetary policy,
while supporting well-targeted measures to alleviate the impact of the food and fuel price
shocks on vulnerable groups. At the same time, some Directors cautioned that in the current
changing economic environment, the case for a tighter fiscal stance is debatable. Most
Directors also saw merit in moving to cyclically-adjusted fiscal targets—and a few suggested the
adoption of a fiscal rule—which they felt would enhance the effectiveness of fiscal policy and
reduce medium-term vulnerabilities. Directors welcomed the operations carried out recently to
improve the debt profile and to reduce debt dollarization.
Directors noted that the banking system is well-capitalized and liquid, with low non-performing
loans. They welcomed the system’s increased resilience to shocks, and called for further
strengthening of the financial sector, particularly in the context of declining bank profitability,
global financial volatility, and dollarization of the economy. The recent rapid growth of bank
credit and an increase in non-resident deposits point to the need for continued proactive bank
supervision. Directors stressed the importance of deepening financial sector reforms and
completing the implementation of the 2006 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP)
recommendations. These include further strengthening state banks and banking supervision,
and completing the restructuring of the housing bank. Directors welcomed the important
progress made so far in this regard. They regarded swift approval of the financial sector law to
be key to enhancing central bank independence and strengthening the supervisory and
resolution frameworks.
Directors noted that Uruguay’s favorable business climate has led to strong foreign direct
investment inflows and a diversification of exports and export markets. They welcomed the
efforts being made to further improve the business climate, including the reform of competition
and bankruptcy legislation.

Statement by Hector Torres, Alternate Executive Director for Uruguay
and David Vogel, Advisor to the Executive Director
October 22, 2008
Background
1.
In 2008, Uruguay has been exhibiting another year of remarkable economic
performance as a result of sound macroeconomic policies and a number of structural reforms.
Certainly, the positive external environment observed in recent years has also contributed to
this performance. Positive shocks can be dilapidated or capitalized to pave the way for
medium and long-term growth. Evidently, the latter has been the case for Uruguay. Indeed,
the Uruguayan government has placed the pillars to reach higher and sustainable
development and critically reduce vulnerabilities in order to be well-prepared for a new stage
in the global economy.
Growth: From Vulnerability to the Road to Strength
2.
Some years ago, many analysts were concerned about the sources of growth and the
low growth rates Uruguay had experienced over a number of decades. According to an IMF
staff report issued in 2003, “over the past 40 years, economic growth in Uruguay has been
relatively low, averaging 1.7 percent a year over 1960-2001.”1
3.
GDP growth is projected to be about 9.5 percent this year. Admittedly, this high
figure is influenced by the opening of a large pulp mill factory, but beyond this, the country’s
medium-term potential growth appears to be significantly higher than the above-referred
average. As noted, sound macroeconomic policies, as well as the implementation of
structural changes, together with Uruguay’s long tradition of respecting the rule of law, are
key factors in allowing the country to attract a substantial amount of direct investment in
many economic sectors. There are a number of cases where investment has already had
substantial effects on the productivity of these sectors. Meanwhile, having demonstrated over
the years that the country enjoys a positive investment climate, as a dynamic process,
investment so far is attracting more capital, with the potential of creating an investment pole.
4.
Of course, research, knowledge and technology constitute key elements to reinforce
the above-referred growth trend, and, among other things, it is worth noting that the
government has made important progress in discussions aimed at opening relevant scientific
centers in Uruguay, following the inauguration of the Institut Pasteur of France less than two
years ago.

August 2003.

Diversifying Markets and Products: From Regional to Global
5.
Exports have continued to show a robust performance. More importantly, Uruguay
has enlarged both the basket of its exports and the markets to which they are shipped. In this
respect, it is worth recalling that a decade ago exports to Mercosur countries represented
approximately 50 percent of the country’s external sales and today it is about 25 percent.
Extra-regional exports have increased significantly.
6.
Of course, as an open economy, Uruguay will have to face new circumstances
stemming from a substantially less benign global economic situation. The global slowdown
will affect the demand for Uruguay’s products; nevertheless, the country has broadened its
basket of exports, improved their quality, and is currently supplying a number of promising
new external markets. This puts Uruguay in a better position to face the current headwinds
and constitutes a critical intangible asset for its medium and long-term development.
Fiscal Side: When the “Unprecedented” Becomes the Norm
7.
By the time the Stand-By Arrangement was signed in 2005, many analysts questioned
the authorities’ capacity to deliver its ambitious fiscal targets. However, the developments
have been quite different. For instance, in 2008, Uruguay will record another year of
important primary fiscal surplus, while the overall fiscal balance is already very close to
equilibrium. In recent years, the fiscal revenue agency has been critically transformed. This
partially explains the country’s outstanding fiscal performance, but the authorities have also
enhanced their expenditure policies. Both collection and expenditure improvements have
been consistently pursued to comply with our authorities’ strong commitment to reinforce
fiscal sustainability.
8.
Furthermore, the results attained in 2008 should be taken into account considering the
fiscal costs incurred by measures aimed at mitigating some of the negative effects caused by
a severe drought, which occurred in a context of above-average oil prices over the medium
term. Similarly, other fiscal resources were used to soften the negative impact that, through
their effects on domestic prices, the surge in commodity prices (particularly, food and oil)
would have had on the most vulnerable sectors of Uruguayan society.
Debt Strategy: The Benefits of Being Prepared
9.
One of the first issues this administration had to deal with was associated with a
stressful debt situation. Thus, the Debt Management Unit was created at the Ministry of
Finance, which has significantly prepared the country to navigate through the current market
turmoil. This was due to the fact that Uruguay has reduced debt costs, made solid progress on
de-dollarization of the debt, and lengthened its maturity. Meanwhile, the public debt-to-GDP
ratio has decreased, as noted by the staff financing needs are well covered, most of the debt is
at fixed rates, and the government already has some contingent credit lines available.

3
Looking at Stability in a Broad Sense
10.
Clearly, the steep reduction in unemployment, the prudent salary recovery from the
very low level resulting from the 2002 crisis, and the better quality of employment coming
from the boost in investment, have made great contributions to significantly reduce poverty
conditions. Nonetheless, the above-referred developments would not have been enough to
reach the results already observed. Transparent and well-targeted social plans have been
essential in this regard.
11.
Meanwhile, having a broader view on the issue, the Uruguayan authorities point out
the importance of moving to a countercyclical policy rule when the conditions allow it. It is
worth noting that using part of the fiscal space left by the debt strategy and fiscal policies,
our authorities devoted an important amount of resources to education, health, and
infrastructure, which, in the medium term, will entail benefits in terms of poverty reduction,
employment, quality of life, and growth. Some of the social plans—for example, Plan Ceibal,
which provides laptops to public school children—involve an important investment, but have
initial and ending points.
12.
12. Maybe the issue of pro or countercyclical policies should be treated in another
ambit, beyond Uruguay’s case and with an open mind to determine to what extent fiscal
policies aimed at restoring the social and economic equilibrium after a severe crisis and
establishing—in a prudent, efficient, and transparent manner—expenditures expected to have
a positive impact on investment and growth should be characterized as procyclical.
13.
In sum, the Uruguayan authorities firmly believe that beyond its intrinsic value, social
stability, which includes better income distribution and a higher fairness in the access of
opportunities—particularly in education and health—, involving a virtuous cycle, is a key
factor for investment, growth and even for fiscal sustainability, all of which will contribute to
further improving social conditions. Even though there has been substantial progress in this
regard, the authorities consider that much remains to be done in this area.
Keeping Inflation under Control
14.
Like many countries around the world, inflation has been pressured by high
commodity prices. However, the authorities have implemented monetary and fiscal policies
to keep inflation under control. When necessary, our authorities have tightened monetary
policy, as was the case of the interest rate hike decided some weeks ago. Meanwhile, the
administration’s rapid reaction to establish fiscal measures aimed at softening certain price
increases—as noted, these measures were essential to protect the most vulnerable people—
also helped to avoid the introduction of indexatory mechanisms which, otherwise, would
have exerted further pressures on inflation through second-round effects.
15.
Other measures aimed at further opening the economy and continuing to establish
sound incentives for production and investment also play an important role in smoothing

4
price increases and/or forging lower inflationary expectations. The outcomes have been
positive, not only looking at the present but particularly at the future and, in this regard, it is
evident that inflation expectations for the coming years are at the upper limit but within the
authorities’ target range (the median for 2009 is 7 percent and 6.69 percent for March
2009/Feb 2010).
16.
The Central Bank made some opportunistic foreign currency purchases in recent
years, which has allowed Uruguay to increase international reserves and smooth some of the
exchange rate volatility. With the benefit of hindsight, it was the right decision, to the extent
that reserves are currently around the level considered as optimal for the country, while some
changes in the relations among currencies observed in recent weeks in many countries has
been significantly less abrupt and volatile in Uruguay, after having intervened with a very
modest amount of reserves.
A Sounder Financial System
17.
Six years after suffering a severe crisis and having implemented key structural
reforms in the sector, the financial system is sound and resilient, which is clearly reflected in
the financial soundness indicators. As underscored in the staff report, “capitalization is
adequate, non-performance loans are low, and the system’s liquidity remains high”. The staff
report also notes that financial dollarization is high, which has been the case in Uruguay for
many decades. However, it is very important to pay attention to the declining trend, which is
reflected in the figures presented in Chapter II of the Selected Issues Paper. More
importantly, currency mismatching risks have been drastically minimized. In this regard,
dollar loans extended to the non-tradable sector have fallen from 84 percent in 2002 to 55
percent today, while dollar loans to families represent 16 percent of the total loans to that
segment. Also, on the financial system, the housing bank, BHU, has been critically
transformed, and will resume activities under the best practices.
Conclusions
18.
The global economic situation poses important challenges for an open and small
economy such as Uruguay’s. However, the global turmoil has arrived at a time when
Uruguay is well prepared to face it. Growth is robust, investment is continuing to increase
while unemployment and poverty are decreasing, financial needs are well covered, the
financial system is solid and resilient, and fiscal and monetary policies are prudent and are
set to keep inflation under control. In sum, our authorities are well aware of the substantial
challenges lying ahead and they are ready to take the needed measures when necessary.
Likewise, the Uruguayan authorities do believe that the progress made so far and the ongoing
efforts in terms of policies and reforms will continue reaping fruits for the benefit of the
country and its people.
