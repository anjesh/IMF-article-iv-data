STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
September 21, 2011

KEY ISSUES
Outlook: The size and strength of domestic demand, as well as large policy buffers,
limit downside risks from deteriorating global conditions. Indeed, in the absence of a
significant further deterioration in global conditions, the strength of domestic demand
could lead to higher inflationary pressures in 2012. Ambitious medium term growth
objectives are achievable if long standing issues related to infrastructure, the
investment climate, and legislative reforms are addressed.
Managing capital flows and exchange rate policy: Continued exchange rate
flexibility will be important in managing volatile capital flows while the buildup in
reserves over the past eighteen months should help buffer any deterioration of
international financial conditions.
Monetary policy: While immediate pressures on headline inflation have abated, core
inflation is projected to rise later this year and into 2012 as credit growth and strong
activity add to domestic demand. Bank Indonesia should be prepared to adjust its
monetary policy stance to contain inflationary pressures and achieve its more
ambitious inflation target in 2012, as long as global conditions do not deteriorate
substantially.
Fiscal policy: The fiscal deficit is projected to increase in 2011 due to increasing energy
subsidies. In spite of recent reform measures to improve budget implementation,
development spending in the first six months followed historical patterns of low
execution. An overall lack of flexibility limits the scope for countercyclical fiscal policy.
In the medium term, subsidy reform and increased revenue mobilization will be needed
to provide the fiscal space necessary for higher public infrastructure investment and
social expenditures.
Financial policies: Current domestic financial conditions are benign. Some key
recommendations of the 2010 FSAP have already been implemented. Additional
measures should be taken, and prudential controls strengthened to limit possible risks
arising from expanding bank lending. Passage of the Financial System Safety Net
(FSSN) law would strengthen the legal foundation for crisis management.

INDONESIA

CONTEXT
1.
The Indonesian economy proved
resilient during the global financial crisis,
and has since continued to grow at a robust
rate. This resilience reflects the prudent
macroeconomic policies pursued over the last
decade. Both public and private indebtedness
have fallen sharply, international reserves have
been rebuilt, and inflation has been contained.
Key banking system vulnerabilities have been
reduced by improvements in financial
regulation, and other structural reforms are
continuing. Political stability and favorable
demographic trends provide an opportunity
for even stronger economic performance over
the medium term.
2.
Despite the current strong
fundamentals, the achievement of higher
sustained and equitable growth remains
challenging. Infrastructure bottlenecks could
increasingly limit growth. More fiscal resources
are needed to fund public infrastructure
projects and social spending, and capital
markets remain shallow.
3.
The joint IMF˗World Bank Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP),
completed in 2010, found that the banking
sector was resilient. The banking system had
a large capital buffer, ample liquidity, and
remained profitable even through the
economic slowdown in 2009. Stress tests
found that a limited number of banks were
vulnerable to extreme liquidity shocks and a
few large banks susceptible to concentration

risk. Exchange rate and contagion risks were
not major concerns. The FSAP also identified
further reform areas to enhance financial
sector resilience. Key reform priorities centered
around strengthening the legal and
governance framework for supervision,
coordination of macro microprudential
supervision and crisis management, securing
BI’s financial independence, and developing
capital markets.
4.
In concluding the 2010 Article IV
consultation (August 27, 2010), the Fund
commended the Indonesian authorities for
their impressive policy performance, which
successfully steered the economy through
the global financial crisis. Directors
commended Indonesia’s progress over the last
decade in improving financial stability and
welcomed the steps being taken by the
authorities to further strengthen the resilience
of the financial sector in line with the
recommendations of the FSAP. Directors
considered that maintaining exchange rate
flexibility was an important part of the toolkit
to manage the volatility of capital flows. They
advised that BI should signal its readiness to
respond to rising inflationary pressures to
anchor inflation expectations within the target
range. To reduce sterilization costs, Directors
recommended the gradual conversion of the
nonmarketable government bonds on BI’s
balance sheet to marketable bonds, thereby
also expanding BI’s operational toolkit.
Directors endorsed the

INDONESIA

overall fiscal stance for 2010, but noted that
further fiscal reforms would be necessary to
support sustained high growth. Specifically,
reducing energy subsidies would create

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

additional fiscal space for much needed
infrastructure spending and transfer programs
for the poor.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: ROBUST GROWTH WITH
SOME INFLATIONARY PRESSURES
5.
Indonesia’s macroeconomic
performance remains very strong. Real GDP
grew 6.5 percent y/y in the first half of the
year, and growth has become more balanced,
with investment adding to consumption and
exports as the main engines of growth. The
strength of domestic demand has been
mirrored in the rapid expansion of the services
sector, which has contributed about two thirds
of total economic growth. Retail sales and
consumer confidence remained robust in the
second quarter while industrial production
growth and business confidence also
strengthened.
6.
Headline inflation has eased in
recent months on slowing food price rises.
At end˗2010, rising food prices had pushed CPI
inflation to 7 percent y/y, exceeding BI’s
4−6 percent target range. Headline inflation
started to ease since February 2011, falling to

4.8 percent y/y in August. Food prices had
been held down by good local harvests and
increased rice imports, but rose in July August,
reflecting seasonal demand during Ramadan.
Core inflation rose steadily through 2010 and
into 2011, reaching 5.2 percent in August.
Producer price inflation and inflationary
expectations remain elevated. Public sector
wages are also expected to increase as a result
of administrative reforms while private sector
wage growth has also accelerated in the
mining and agricultural sectors.
7.
The current account surplus has
declined in line with strengthening
domestic demand, but capital inflows have
increased. Export revenues continue to rise,
buoyed by higher commodity prices and
strong regional growth. Strong portfolio
inflows have continued this year, reflecting
mainly large nonresident purchases of
government bonds (SUNs) and, to a lesser
extent, central bank bills (SBIs) and equities.
The surge in gross portfolio inflows has
averaged 2 percent of GDP per quarter since
June 2009. As a result, over one˗third of SUNs
and SBIs are now owned by nonresidents.
Foreign direct investment inflows have also

Box 1. Indonesia: Exchange Rate Assessment
After a large depreciation following the Lehman event in the fourth quarter of 2008, the real
effective exchange rate (REER) returned to its pre crisis high by Q1 of 2010 and continued on an
appreciating trend in 2011. The appreciation has been accompanied by strong export growth
in 2010 and the first half of 2011. Although
exports have been driven by buoyant

suggest that the REER is slightly

taking into account the confidence interval, Indonesia’s REER is in line with its fundamentals.

10.
Capital inflows and robust economic
growth have underpinned substantial gains
in other financial markets. Despite the recent
market correction, stocks have outperformed
other bourses in the region, rising over
4 percent year to date in U.S. dollar terms by
mid˗September, with net inflows to equities of
nearly $1.4 billion over the same period.

budgeting procedures to improve execution,
but this has not yet been reflected in increased
spending. Spending units were provided
greater flexibility to reallocate expenditures
within their overall budget allocation. In
addition, pilot performance˗based budgeting
and medium˗term expenditure frameworks
have been expanded to more line ministries to
improve spending effectiveness.
12.
Indonesian banks continue to be
profitable and generally well capitalized,
consistent with the findings of the 2010
FSAP. Capital adequacy ratios slipped
1 percent between March 2010 and May 2011,
mainly due to the introduction of the
operational risk component of Basel II.
However, the system remains well capitalized.
The impact of completing the Basel II
transition and moving towards Basel III is
expected to be minimal. Asset quality is
generally satisfactory, with the nonperforming
loan ratio remaining below 3 percent, and the
loan to deposit ratio edging upwards over the
past year following a cyclical pickup in lending.
Indonesia is in the process of addressing
deficiencies in the framework for AML/CFT
noted by the Financial Action Task Force
(FATF), including passage of the AML/CFT Act
in October 2010 and the Fund Transfer Act in
March 2011.

INDONESIA

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
13.
Immediate risks to economic
stability are manageable. Staff projects
growth to be sustained at 6.4 percent in 2011
and 6.3 percent in 2012 despite the lower
global growth projected in the
September 2011 World Economic Outlook. The
most likely risk is a reversal in portfolio inflows
related to a sudden drop in foreign investor
demand for government debt (such as a new
round of risk aversion caused by spillovers
from advanced economies). Foreign ownership
in government rupiah debt is high at
35 percent, but Indonesia is now in a better
position to manage such an event with strong
reserves and fiscal room (including substantial
cash reserves). Public debt remains on a
sustainable path and is expected to decrease
to around 25 percent of GDP by end˗2011 (see
Appendix I). A sharp rise in bond yields would
affect the banking system through increases in
funding costs, market losses, and loan defaults,
but the banks’ current high profitability and
capital positions should be sufficient to buffer
these shocks. That said, the lack of a financial
safety network is a major weakness and could
allow an individual bank failure to become a
systemic problem.
14.
The external outlook, however,
remains highly uncertain. Indonesia is not
immune to spillovers from a global financial
shock that would lead to another recession in
advanced economies. It could be affected
through the trade, financial, and commodity
price channel. On the trade side, the effect
would mainly feed through commodity exports
as Indonesia is less integrated in the regional
supply chain for manufactured goods. In this
regard, China’s demand and its policy

response in such a shock scenario would be
crucial to investors’ sentiment in Indonesia, as
commodity exports to China have increased
significantly in recent years. The financial
channel is not expected to play a big role, as
the private sector and banks are not
dependent on foreign financing. While foreign
currency borrowing has increased rapidly in
the past year, it remains low relative to
corporate balance sheets and to GDP.
Indonesia’s relatively large domestic economy
could prove resilient if consumption and
domestic investment can carry the momentum
even if FDI and commodity related investment
slowed down significantly as part of an adverse
global scenario.
15.
Market prices indicate that risks
remain low but are sensitive to changes in
global sentiment.1 Correlations between the
European periphery’s and Indonesia’s financial
assets have been low, compared to other G˗20
emerging markets. In the recent bout of global
risk aversion, CDS spreads and EMBI spreads
have risen, but they remain below 2010 highs.
In fact, Indonesia’s EMBI spreads have
performed better than other large emerging
markets. The stock market index has declined
from a high level while domestic bond yields,
as well as the rupiah, have returned to second
quarter levels as of mid˗September (Figure 5).
A ratings upgrade would substantially widen
the foreign investor base and trigger inflows
from funds that have mandates restricting
them to investment grade assets, and this

selected issues papers.

could push both local and global bond yields
even lower.
16.
Over the medium term, staff
projects growth to reach 7 percent,
underpinned by both public and private
sector investment, provided that the
government’s ambitious infrastructure and
structural reform agenda is implemented.
The current account is projected to move to
small deficits starting in 2012, due to robust
investment demand and a trend decline in the
terms of trade. Strong capital inflows—both
FDI and portfolio investment—are expected to
continue since planned structural reforms and
infrastructure spending will expand private
investment opportunities.
17.
The Government’s recently released
Master Plan2 aims to make Indonesia one of
the world’s largest economies by 2025. The
first pillar of the plan is the development of six
regional economic corridors through
investments in sectors with high growth
prospects and clear comparative advantages.
This will be supported by the second and third
pillars, namely improving connectivity and

2

Masterplan for the Acceleration and Expansion of

Indonesia Economic Development 2011−2025.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

strengthening human resources and science
and technology. The Master Plan targets
investments of $468 billion over 2011−2025, of
which 45 percent will be in infrastructure.
One˗fifth of the total investment is expected to
come from the government. The Master Plan’s
assumptions for GDP growth and private
investment, in particular, are very ambitious
and will require a substantial acceleration in
the reform agenda and increased political
commitment to implementation.
18.
Indonesia’s growth path will depend
on the success of the government’s reform
program in accelerating public
infrastructure projects and increasing
human capital. A growth accounting
framework (Box 2) suggests that if little further
progress is made on infrastructure investment
and other reforms, capital accumulation and
total factor productivity growth could slow,
and growth could be limited to 6 percent (or
less) over the medium term. However,
potential growth could reach 8 percent if more
ambitious reforms are enacted, and spending
on infrastructure is substantially increased.

INDONESIA

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 2. Indonesia: Estimating Potential Growth 1/
Using growth accounting methods, Indonesia’s potential growth rate was estimated, and the change in
output decomposed into the contributions of capital and labor and the efficiency with which the factors are
combined. Estimating potential growth is highly dependent on the quality of the underlying data, and
assumptions were necessary to calculate historical series for both capital and labor inputs.
Prior to the Asian crisis (1991−1997), estimated potential growth was robust at 6.5 percent and
predominantly input driven, specifically by capital accumulation. After becoming negative immediately after
the Asian crisis, estimated potential growth recovered partly to 4 percent during 2001−2005, with
productivity gains dominating during this period owing to institutional reforms and growth conducive
policies. Since 2006, potential growth picked up to

labor and capital inputs rather than by efficiency.
Baseline
12

Indonesia’s potential growth rate in the baseline
scenario is estimated to gradually rise to 7 percent,
mostly reflecting the increase in capital
accumulation and efficiency. For a downside
scenario, if there were slow progress on
infrastructure and other structural reforms, the
growth rate would stagnate to about 6 percent.
Raising Indonesia’s potential growth to 8 percent
over the medium term would require substantial
enhancements in capital and efficiency.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy: Controlling Liquidity amid
Sustained Inflows

19.
Headline inflation has eased in
recent months as rice imports and the
harvest have tempered food price increases,
but upward pressure on core inflation is
expected to remain. Excess liquidity remains
high, wages and real credit growth are
increasing, and the fiscal stance is expected to
add stimulus in the second half of the year.
The future path of food prices will play a major
role in the evolution of inflation, but recent
increases in rice stocks and plans to import
rice limit the risk of a repeat of last year’s
sharp spike in headline inflation. Nevertheless,
as the output gap is estimated to have closed
by 2011:Q3, core inflation is projected by staff
to remain at 5 percent in 2011 and could
increase further in 2012, assuming that
planned reductions in energy subsidies take
place. This would push headline inflation to
around 6½ percent in 2012, well above BI’s
target band of 4.5 ±1.0 percent.
20.
Under these circumstances, and
given the lags in monetary policy
transmission, BI will need to contain
inflationary expectations and limit
second˗round effects from energy price
increases. Unless there is a substantial
deterioration in the external environment,
Indonesia’s growth momentum will remain
solid and broadly based. Therefore, there is
little risk that monetary policy tightening will
cause an unintended economic downturn, and
the current accommodative conditions will
eventually need to be withdrawn. Keeping
inflation within the target range will also
increase the credibility of BI and help achieve a
12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

sustained reduction in inflation over the
medium term. The current volatility
surrounding the global economic outlook and
market sentiment suggests that an increase in
the policy rate can be delayed until the
situation becomes clearer.
21.
Staff recommended that BI use all
instruments at its disposal to constrain any
rise in inflationary pressures and the pace
of credit growth. A combination of policy rate
increases, liquidity withdrawal (including
through additional increases in reserve
requirements), and further exchange rate
appreciation would help broaden transmission
channels and increase policy effectiveness.
Complementary macroprudential measures
could also be used to help manage
macroeconomic risks stemming from rising
credit growth. This broad approach would
provide a strong signal of BI’s resolve to lower
inflation, which will help it attain its more
ambitious 2012 inflation target and its medium
term commitment to lower inflation to
3 percent. BI should also guide price
expectations around planned energy price
increases by providing projections of the direct
effects on inflation of such measures ahead of
time, and explicitly stating how much of the
first round effects it will accommodate in its
inflation target. Assuming that demand
conditions remain robust, as in the baseline
forecast, staff believes that increases in the real
policy rates will be necessary and emphasized
that timely action would help control
expectations to limit the size of the eventual
adjustment.

INDONESIA

22.
Strengthening the transmission
from BI’s monetary operations to liquidity
conditions, interest rates, and ultimately
domestic demand, is crucial to improving
the effectiveness and credibility of
monetary policy. Staff noted that, while BI
had made significant improvements to its
monetary operations and taken steps to
encourage money market development,
persistent excess liquidity and weak money
market activity were dampening the impact of
changes in BI policy on banks’ cost of funds.
Improving the effectiveness of monetary
operations will require a coordinated and

to foreign investors. Although foreign
investors have switched to T˗bills and shorter
maturity government bonds, the available
amount is smaller and trading thin. FDI inflows,
however, are projected to increase further.
These inflows have been broad˗based,
attracted by Indonesia’s large consumer base,
low labor costs, and profitable commodity
projects. Given the strong prospects for
Indonesia and the region, FDI inflows should
become a larger and perhaps less volatile
source of support for the capital account than
portfolio inflows.

sustained series of reforms aimed at absorbing
excess liquidity, providing more consistent
interest rate signals from monetary
instruments, and improving money market
functioning (Box 3). In this regard, staff advised
that BI should be more proactive with its
monetary operations to withdraw liquidity and
bring the overnight interbank rate closer to the
policy rate. Failing to do so could cause
confusion in the market and for the wider
public about the central bank’s policy
intentions.
23.
Strong capital flows are projected to
continue. Portfolio inflows are projected to
slow down for the rest of 2011, as the 6 month
holding period of SBIs imposed in May will
limit the supply of these instruments available

With reserves at comfortable levels,
staff supported BI’s stance to allow greater
exchange rate flexibility in the face of
strong inflows. Accordingly, there should be
less emphasis on reserve accumulation going
forward with intervention limited to
dampening volatility of the exchange rate. In
the authorities’ view, the rupiah’s recent
appreciation has been in line with others in the
region and has not hurt its price
competitiveness. Staff concurred with the
authorities that portfolio inflows could reverse,
especially if the crisis in the Euro Area
intensifies. The Indonesian authorities
successfully rode out the Lehman Brothers
shock through the appropriate use of reserves
and exchange rate adjustment with limited
impact on financial stability and the real
economy, and they are now in an even
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 13

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

INDONESIA

stronger position to withstand a similar shock.
The international reserve buffers and
government cash reserves built in the last year
could help alleviate pressure on the exchange
rate and local bond markets if a sharp reversal
were to occur. With the recent increase,
reserves are now above existing adequacy
metrics. The authorities and staff also
concurred that while additional capital flow
management measures remain part of the
toolkit, they are not likely to be needed at this
time.

25.
Existing measures to influence
portfolio flows have successfully shifted the
composition of inflows away from BI’s
sterilization instruments. The recent
imposition of a six˗month holding period for
SBIs will lead to some outflows during the rest
of the year because foreign investors will be
unable to roll over their existing holdings.
Additional capital flow measures do not seem
advisable given the need to further develop
and deepen capital markets. The authorities
have put in place a series of backstops for the
bond market if outflows were to lead to undue
volatility in bond yields and the exchange rate.
These include a market stabilization
mechanism that would be funded by a
combination of budget resources, cash
reserves, and balance sheets of state owned
enterprises, and BI has announced it could
14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

conduct auctions to buy rupiah denominated
government bonds in order to reduce
excessive currency volatility. Staff advised that
a flexible approach should be taken, in the
context of the planned crisis management
protocol, to implement these market support
mechanisms so as to avoid providing implicit
insurance by reducing potential volatility for
foreign investors, which could end up
attracting more inflows.
26.
Sterilization costs have been an
increasing drain on the central bank’s
financial resources, as its assets are mainly
low yielding foreign reserves and
noninterest bearing government securities.
This has led to an ongoing erosion of BI’s
capital base. The financial position of the
central bank should be strengthened in the
context of the government’s broader asset
liability management program, including the
exchange of the nonmarketable government
debt held by BI for marketable securities,
which could then be used for monetary
operations and to support the development of
both the money and government debt markets
(Box 3).
27.
Authorities’ views: Bank Indonesia
noted that the current pace of credit growth
was not excessive. Credit to GDP, at
28 percent, was low relative to other countries
in the region, and the recent increase in
lending was more heavily weighted to
investment and working capital. This should
ultimately reduce inflationary pressures by
boosting productive capacity. While
recognizing that there would be further
pressures on inflation, BI felt that the upward
pressure would be limited and could be
managed by adjusting reserve requirements
and tightening prudential controls. Bank
Indonesia also agreed that money market
development is a key priority and had taken

INDONESIA

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 3. Policy Options for Reducing Excess Liquidity, Improving Money Market Operations
and Money Market Development1/
The framework for monetary operations, the management of system liquidity by the central bank, and
money market development are all interlinked, and all contribute to the effectiveness of monetary policy.
In the case of Indonesia, structural excess liquidity, along with impediments to money market
development, especially of repo and swap markets, need to be addressed if both monetary operations
and market functioning are to improve.
BI should use a combination of increased reserve requirements and a predictable calendar of longer tenor
open market operations to provide a structural withdrawal of liquidity. Reserve requirements should be
generally uniform across banks. The uneven distribution of liquidity among banks is better addressed by
improving the incentives for surplus banks to provide liquidity to deficit banks.
To increase the clarity regarding the intent of BI’s monetary operations, the structure of its open market
operations could be simplified. Nontradable term deposits should be phased out because their illiquidity
affects their pricing, complicates banks’ liquidity management, and impedes money market development.
Instead, BI should expand its use of reverse repos to manage liquidity. Structural operations could be
conducted using variable rate auctions on a regular calendar. Eventually these rates will serve as useful
benchmarks and provide indications of market expectations regarding the policy rate.
The capacity for further expansion of the interbank market is limited by the contraction in interbank credit
limits since the global financial crisis, especially for smaller banks. This has lead to some segmentation in
the money market. Measures to improve the infrastructure for interbank repo markets, including adoption
of the new global master repurchase agreement, should be implemented. Expanded use of repos by BI
should also provide more eligible collateral for interbank repos.
Replacing the nonmarketable, noninterest bearing government debt currently held by BI with marketable
debt is a key prerequisite for the reform program outlined above. This will supply the collateral needed by
both BI and banks, improve BI’s policy credibility by providing it with the financial resources to expand its
liquidity withdrawal, and support further development of the local government debt market.

several measures in the last few months,
including strengthening the compilation and
dissemination of interbank data and increasing
the use of reverse repos for liquidity
withdrawal. A new Global Master Repurchase
Agreement, drafted in coordination with the
Ministry of Finance (MOF), the securities
industry regulators, and market

participants, should be adopted by year end.
Both BI and MOF agreed it was important to
address the impact of sterilization costs on the
central bank’s balance sheet and were
discussing possible modalities for
implementing the asset liability management
agenda, including replacing the nonconvertible
government debt held by BI.

B. Fiscal Policy: Improving the Structure of the Budget
28.
The stance of fiscal policy has been a
source of macroeconomic strength, but the
postponement of subsidy reforms limits the
flexibility to increase much needed
infrastructure and social spending. Higher
oil prices have pushed projected subsidy costs
to 3.2 percent of GDP in 2011, compared with
projected development expenditure of
2.3 percent of GDP. Nevertheless, Staff project
that the 2011 budget deficit will be 1.3 percent
of GDP, compared with the proposed revised
budget target of 2.1 of GDP, largely based on
a historical pattern of under spending. In spite
of recent reform measures to improve budget
implementation, execution of spending in the
first six months remained low.
29.
The limited flexibility of the budget
constrains the use of fiscal policy for
countercyclical purposes. This places a
greater burden on monetary policy to respond
to economic fluctuations. If economic growth
were to falter (in response to a deterioration in
global economic conditions, for example),
there is considerable fiscal space to provide
stimulus if needed. However, automatic
stabilizers are small, and implementation
capacity to expand discretionary spending in a
timely manner is very limited. Alternatively, if
economic developments remain robust, staff
noted that any overperformance in revenue
collections in 2011 could be used to reduce
the overall deficit. For 2012, staff urged the
authorities to improve the targeting of
subsidies while increasing infrastructure
spending.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

30.
Staff stressed Indonesia’s own prior
achievements in reducing energy subsidies,
combined with expanding cash transfer
programs to vulnerable groups. Indonesia
successfully implemented such programs
in 2005 and 2008. However, energy subsidies
have risen in line with oil prices and now
account for 18 percent of expenditures.
Moreover, fast increasing domestic fuel
demand, volatile oil prices and uncertainties in
oil and gas production would pose risks to the
budget going forward. Raising administrative
fuel prices, and moving to a flexible pricing
policy, would mean only temporary upward
pressure on inflation if other policies are
directed to limiting second round effects.
Lower subsidies would help provide the
necessary fiscal space for increasing
infrastructure and social spending that would
support higher economic growth.
31.
Raising the tax revenue ratio from
its current low level (12 percent of GDP)
will require not only improved tax
administration, but also closing of
exemptions and broadening the tax base.
Tax efficiency is low relative to regional peers.
Staff emphasized that tax administration
reform should continue to focus on increasing
tax compliance and improving auditing. Staff
identified other areas of the income tax and
the value added tax where base broadening
could be achieved (Box 4).

INDONESIA

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 4. Indonesia: Revenue Mobilization 1/
Indonesia faces the challenge of mobilizing revenue to provide space for poverty relief and
infrastructure improvement. However, simply increasing revenue by further taxing compliant
taxpayers can cause distortions and increase inequalities. Raising revenues in an increasingly
globalized economy requires strengthening broad˗based taxes and improving tax compliance, and
should lead to a more efficient and more equitable tax system that enhances economic growth.
The tax revenue to GDP ratio in Indonesia is one of the lowest in the G˗20. Personal income tax
revenues are as low as 1 percent of GDP, while value˗added tax and corporate income tax each raise
about 4 percent of GDP.

middle˗income countries. These give a range of
potential tax revenue of 13.4−16.4 percent of GDP in the medium term, which is a 2−5 percentage
point improvement from current levels. This target would require both broadening tax bases and
increasing tax compliance.

The following measures could be considered to broaden the tax base over time:


Limiting VAT exemptions: Many goods and services are exempt. Reducing the number of
exemptions would expand the tax base and raise VAT revenues.



Limiting tax holidays and corporate income tax exemptions: Many companies receive preferential
treatment, such as investment tax allowances, accelerated depreciation, special tax rates for
certain industries, etc. CIT revenues could be increased substantially by removing these
inefficiencies. Tax holidays and exemptions should be targeted to a few well˗specified sectors,
with clear and transparent criteria, and for a well˗defined preset period of time.



Taxing fringe benefits: The personal income tax system is well designed and reasonably simple,
including a widespread withholding of tax at source. However, fringe benefits remain exempt
from personal income tax. Taxing this source of income could raise substantial additional
revenues.

32.
Authorities’ views: The authorities
noted that the delays in capital expenditures
so far in 2011 were caused by recent changes
to procurement procedures, which forced the
reissuance of some tenders originally initiated
in late˗2010, and they expect implementation
to improve in coming months. There is
widespread agreement among government
officials and the public that fuel prices must be
raised, but the decision remains a political one.
There are plans to restrict fuel subsidies to

private vehicles on Java, but significant
implementation hurdles remain. In addition to
continuing the tax administration reforms, the
authorities also saw some scope to increase
nontax revenues by raising dividend and
royalty income. The authorities agreed that
increasing revenues will be crucial for fiscal
reform.

C. Financial Policies: Strengthening Safety Nets
33.
Bank Indonesia has made progress
towards the FSAP recommendation to
establish a legally mandated Prompt
Correction Action (PCA) mechanism that
would improve its ability to resolve weak
banks in a timely and transparent manner. BI
has issued a new regulation on problem bank
exit, which improves the existing framework by
expanding the criteria to place a bank under
“intensive” supervision, introducing a time limit
for resolving weaknesses, and requiring a
capital injection to exit from special
surveillance. In addition, the authorities have
requested technical assistance to guide further
reforms. Further strengthening the regime will
provide a critical line of defense in maintaining
financial stability, particularly given the
absence of a robust financial safety net.
Additional steps could include amending the
Banking Act to require early supervisory
corrective actions based on capital adequacy
and other indicators, tightening the rule for
recognizing a failed bank and transferring the
bank from special surveillance to the deposit
insurance agency (LPS), and amending the LPS
law to provide for a wider array of bank
resolution tools.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

34.
Over the past year, BI supervisors
have focused on developing and
implementing a new risk rating system for
the banks. The new rating system, which is
more forward˗looking and uses more
qualitative methodology, is a landmark shift
from the existing system. A regulation has
been issued, training has commenced, and full
implementation is on track for the
January 2012 deadline. In connection with the
new rating system, BI has issued a new fit and
proper regulation and a regulation on
implementing pillar I of Basel II. Government
officials have been discussing changes in
single ownership limits for banks as a way to
improve governance. Since there are other
tools available to address governance
concerns, including fit and proper
requirements for strategic ownership positions,
staff noted that ownership limits could make it
more difficult for banks to raise capital.
35.
Bank Indonesia supervisors have
been making good use of their stress
testing framework. Following on from work
carried out during the FSAP, BI’s Financial
System Stability Bureau conducts stress testing
on a monthly basis and reports the results to
the Board and informs the supervisors, who

INDONESIA

utilize the tool as a basis for discussions with
the banks. As a result, and in anticipation of
further credit growth, many banks have raised
their capital levels. While the strong GDP
growth outlook suggests vulnerabilities remain
low, supervisors should be alert to aggressive
growth strategies pursued by some banks and
move forward on discussions to revise the loan
classification standards. The staff
recommended other macroprudential
measures that could limit risks from rapid
expansion of bank lending, including raising
risk weights on the fastest growing sectors,
such as consumer and foreign currency
corporate lending, and adopting forward
looking provisioning requirements. A small
number of Indonesian banks are still
vulnerable to interest rate shocks on their
banking books; however, the most recent
interest rate risk sensitivity analysis shows that
these risks have declined further since the
FSAP. The proposed law to establish an
independent financial supervision agency (OJK)
continues to stall, as details regarding the
composition of the Board of Commissioners
are being discussed in parliament. This
longstanding issue was also addressed during
the FSAP and a subsequent technical
assistance mission. The FSAP stressed that
there were significant risks to bank supervision
being transferred out of BI and noted that
close cooperation between BI and the OJK (if
forthcoming) would be essential.3

3

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

36.
The adoption of the Financial
System Safety Net (FSSN) law remains
outstanding. As noted in the FSAP, the FSSN
law would provide a legal foundation for crisis
management and address certain issues, such
as emergency lending. While the various
financial sector regulatory agencies are
proceeding with developing their individual
crisis management protocols, passage of the
FSSN remains critical to ensure that a legal
basis exists for decisions that would need to
be taken if a crisis were to occur. Other
financial sector laws currently under review,
such as the BI Act, the Banking Act, and the
Capital Markets law, should be amended to
provide a proper bank resolution framework
and to ensure consistency with the FSSN law.
37.
Authorities’ views: The authorities
expressed appreciation for the assistance
provided during the FSAP to build capacity for
stress testing, which has now been
incorporated into BI’s surveillance function. In
addition, there is widespread agreement that
an FSSN law is important for safeguarding
financial stability and managing crisis.
However, efforts taken thus far to strengthen
the financial safety net by introducing an exit
policy regulation (PCA) were viewed by BI as
providing an adequate mechanism to deal with
any issues that might emerge at this time while
efforts continue to adopt the FSSN.

D. Trade and Development Policies
38.
The government is pursuing a
number of trade policy initiatives. Efforts are
underway to make the decision making
process for nontariff barriers more transparent
and to improve the coordination between
various government departments responsible
for these measures. In the context of food
security, Indonesia has improved its own
procedures for importing rice and is using its
position as the ASEAN Chair this year to
promote regional rice reserves and trade
protocols.
39.
The authorities expressed
disappointment over the stalled Doha
Round talks and hoped for more leadership
by advanced economies in multilateral trade
negotiations. They noted that Indonesia was
now involved in bilateral trade discussions,
mostly in the Asian region, and felt that the
positive impact of these arrangements could
be enhanced further if they were
complemented by progress at the multilateral
level.
40.
Capital market development is
needed to diversify funding sources.
Strengthening investor confidence will be an
important factor in propelling the markets
forward. To this end, and as noted in the
MOF’s Master Plan, ensuring that high quality
financial information is provided by market
players should remain a top priority, and the
transitioning to International Financial

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Reporting Standards is a positive move. This
process will be aided by strengthening other
infrastructure elements, such as the Capital
Markets Law and increasing public awareness
of products. Encouraging state owned
enterprises to list on the domestic exchange
and expanding the institutional investor base
by supporting pension fund industry
development would also assist in market
development.
41.
The authorities were hopeful that a
critical weight of reforms could be achieved
in the next few months that would catalyze
additional foreign direct investment.
Passage of the Land Acquisition Act and the
successful negotiation of two more major
public private partnership infrastructure
projects to complement a central Java power
project, recently launched, would be critical.
Overseas interest in investing in Indonesia was
mostly coming from the Asian region but is
now increasing from other regions as well.
Investors have focused on labor intensive
manufacturing, where there is some evidence
that firms are shifting production to Indonesia,
and on sectors serving a growing Indonesia
consumer market, such as retail, personal care,
and automobiles.

INDONESIA

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

STAFF APPRAISAL
42.
Immediate outlook: Indonesian GDP
growth is projected to remain robust at around
6−6½ percent y/y in both 2011 and 2012.
Increases in both foreign and domestic
investment, including an anticipated increase
in government infrastructure spending, are
expected to offset lower growth contributions
from net exports as import demand rises.
Accelerating credit growth and an anticipated
reduction in energy subsidies should push core
inflation modestly higher this year and
into 2012. Although the current account could
move into deficit next year, the overall balance
of payments will remain in surplus as capital
inflows continue.
43.
Risks: A key risk to the near˗term
outlook would be a further deterioration in
growth for advanced economies, resulting
from the continuing turmoil in Europe and
budgetary issues in the United States. In
addition to reduced global demand for
Indonesian exports and lower commodity
prices, this would cause a sharp increase in
global risk aversion, which could lead to capital
outflows from Indonesia. However, given
strong fundamentals, and low dependence on
external demand, the downside risks for
Indonesia appear to be manageable.
44.
Continued exchange rate flexibility
will be important in managing volatile
capital flows, and the buildup in reserves over
the past eighteen months will help buffer any
deterioration of international financial
conditions. While FDI inflows are expected to
continue, portfolio inflows could reverse,
especially if the crisis in the Euro Area

intensifies. There are no signs of any
misalignment in the exchange rate, and
exports (including manufacturing) are strong.
The current level of international reserves is
adequate, including after taking into account
foreign investor holdings of local currency
government debt.
45.
Given rising domestic demand
pressures and lags in monetary policy
transmission, BI should be prepared to
tighten its policy stance in the future to
achieve its lower inflation target for 2012.
Since current demand indicators are robust,
the staff sees little risk of a policy˗induced
slowdown in growth, assuming no major
further deterioration in global prospects. To
broaden policy transmission channels, BI
should use a combination of policy rate
increases, macroprudential measures and
liquidity absorption to limit excessive domestic
demand growth and control inflationary
expectations, and focus its communications on
its commitment to the inflation target.
Macroprudential measures should be
considered to reduce risks associated with
accelerating credit growth. These could include
raising risk weights on sectors with rapidly
growing credit, such as consumer credit, and
countercyclical capital and forward˗looking
provisioning requirements.
46.
Persistent excess liquidity and the
underdeveloped interbank market limit the
effectiveness of monetary policy. BI’s
operational framework should be adjusted to
more effectively direct short˗term interbank
rates towards its policy rate while promoting

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 21

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

INDONESIA

market development. Absorption of structural
excess liquidity through a combination of
reserve requirement increases and open
market operations will be a key first step. The
current uneven distribution of liquidity among
banks should be addressed by improving
money market functioning, including
promoting the use of instruments that limit
credit risk such as repos and swaps.
47.
The government should act quickly
to strengthen BI’s financial resources by
replacing nontradable noninterest˗bearing
government debt currently held by BI with
marketable securities, and replenishing its
capital base. This would increase BI’s capacity
to absorb liquidity inflows, contribute to
money market development, and improve the
credibility of BI’s commitment to low inflation.
Further, it would contribute to the deepening
of the market for government securities.
48.
To provide a legal foundation for
crisis management, the adoption of the
Financial System Safety Net (FSSN) law
should be a top priority. The FSSN law would
address crisis management issues, such as
emergency lending and, while the various
financial sector regulatory agencies are
proceeding with developing their individual
crisis management protocols, passage of the
FSSN remains critical to ensure that a legal
basis exists for decisions that would need to
be taken if a crisis were to occur. Other
financial sector laws should also be reviewed
to ensure consistency with the FSSN law.
49.
The authorities’ efforts to
strengthen supervisory oversight by
developing a new risk˗based bank rating
system are appropriate. The new system will
require more qualitative judgment in assessing
a bank’s safety and soundness and will expand

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

the range of actions supervisors could take to
address problems. The new supervisory
risk˗based rating system for banks will also aid
the introduction of a risk˗based premium
deposit insurance system. A move to such a
system from the existing flat˗rate premium
scheme, potentially supported by additional
capital for LPS, will help ensure that the
deposit insurance scheme has sufficient

50.
Fiscal developments are consistent
with the government’s firm commitment to
sustainability and strong public finances.
However, increasing fuel subsidies are
distorting the structure of the budget and
increasing the deficit in 2011, providing a
significant demand stimulus and increasing the
burden on monetary policy. In the current
outlook, any revenue collections in excess of
the 2011 budget estimates should be saved so
as to reduce the stimulus from fiscal policy. If
there were to be a deterioration in the
economic outlook, there is considerable fiscal
space to provide stimulus, but the ability to do
so in a timely manner is likely to be
constrained by implementation capacity. The
overall fiscal stance in 2012 should place
further emphasis on infrastructure spending.
To support these objectives, the government
should implement its commitment to reduce,
and better target, subsidies this year. The
burgeoning cost of the current subsidy
schemes limits the flexibility of fiscal policy and
the ability to fund priority expenditures, as well
as contributing to uncertainty regarding
inflation and other macroeconomic outcomes.
51.
The medium term fiscal strategy
should balance the authorities’ wish for
further public debt consolidation with
improving the effectiveness of fiscal policy
to support growth. A lack of infrastructure

INDONESIA

remains one of the biggest constraints to
boosting Indonesia’s growth potential.
Significant improvements to the regulatory
framework are needed to support
infrastructure spending and PPP projects.
Weak budget implementation is also an
obstacle to higher public investment. Social
safety nets should be better targeted towards
vulnerable groups while increased, and more
effective, education and health spending will
be needed to promote improvements in
human capital and generate more equitable

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

growth. To support these objectives, continued
efforts are also needed to raise the tax revenue
ratio from its current low level to provide
greater fiscal space. Improving tax efficiency
will require broadening tax bases through
increasing tax compliance with revenue
administration reforms and containing the use
of tax incentives.
52.
It is proposed that the next Article IV
consultation with Indonesia take place on the
standard 12˗month cycle.

shock in 2009. The ratio fell to a record low
level of 27 percent in 2010 (Figure I.1) owing to
prudent fiscal management, which led to
primary fiscal surpluses averaging 1.6 percent
of GDP per year in the last decade and a
modest fiscal stimulus in response to the
global shock in 2009. Lower interest rates and
high real GDP growth also contributed to debt
consolidation. Foreign currency debt (mostly
to multilateral institutions) has fallen markedly
to less than half of total debt, as the improved
fiscal position facilitated government access to
the domestic capital market.
The baseline scenario projects a further
moderate decline in public sector debt.
Despite a larger fiscal deficit, public debt is
likely to fall to about 25 percent of GDP
in 2011, reflecting rupiah appreciation, falling
interest rates, and robust economic growth. In
the medium term, gradual fiscal adjustment—
based on subsidy reduction and tax
administration reforms and continued strong

economic growth—will support a further
decline in public debt to 21 percent of GDP
by 2016. Such a strategy will ensure a primary
balance near zero, but also accommodate
extra resources for development spending.
Public debt is sustainable and robust to
macroeconomic and oil price shocks. All the
standard stress tests suggest that the debt
ratio is likely to remain modest even under
shocks from contingent liabilities, sharp
exchange rate movements, and higher interest
rates (Figure I.1). Fiscal contingent liabilities
amounting to 10 percent of GDP could raise
public sector debt to 30 percent of GDP
by 2016 (still below the 2008 level), while
currency depreciation of 30 percent would
raise the debt ratio to about 25 percent of
GDP. An increase in real interest rates would
have a smaller, but still sizeable, effect with the
debt ratio reaching 23 percent by 2015. Other
macroeconomic shocks have an even more
limited impact.

B. External Debt
Indonesia’s external debt continues on a
steady downward trend, after a temporary
increase in 2009. Following a decade of a
continuously improving external position, the
sharp nominal depreciation of late 2008 and
early 2009 temporarily led to an increase in the
external debt to GDP ratio from 30 percent to
32 percent. However, strong growth and the
rapid turnaround in the exchange rate are

36

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

quickly reversing this increase, with the ratio
projected to decline to about 27 percent of
GDP as early as end 2011 (Figure I.2).
The baseline scenario projects external debt to
continue on a declining path over the medium
term, reaching 21 percent of GDP by 2016. A
weakening current account balance—
projected to reach about −1 percent of GDP

INDONESIA

by 2016—is expected to be more than offset
by: (i) sustained high real GDP growth in the
range of 6.5−7.0 percent per year;
(ii) increasing nondebt creating (i.e., FDI) flows;
and (iii) some further real appreciation. At
−0.5 percent of GDP, the medium term
noninterest current account balance would
remain comfortably above the debt stabilizing
level (−3.4 percent of GDP).

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

External sustainability is robust to most shocks.
The external debt ratio is expected to follow a
declining path and remain at manageable
levels under all standardized shock scenarios.
A one˗time 30 percent real exchange rate
depreciation would have the largest impact,
raising the debt ratio by 11 percentage points
in 2012, and 9 percentage points over the
baseline by 2016.

APPENDIX II: INDONESIA—TRANSITION TO
GFSM 2001
The presentation of central government
operations in the main text of the staff report
is currently compatible with the national
presentation of the budget. The accounting of
government operations in Indonesia is on a
cash basis, covers only the central government
and is, therefore, not fully compatible with the
GFSM 2001 format. To ensure the
comparability of IMF staff projections with the
authorities’ forecast, the staff report table is in
the same format as the budget presentation.
However, to promote international
comparability of government operations,
preliminary data consolidated to the general
government level in a GFSM 2001 compatible
format is also presented in this appendix.

42

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

The Indonesian authorities are in the process
of moving to accrual accounting, and they are
planning for full implementation by 2015.
Although budget reporting by local
governments is beginning to improve, it is still
subject to long lags, does not follow GFS
reporting standards, and does not have a
homogenous classification of expenditures.
The Ministry of Finance does not obtain
comprehensive and timely information on
borrowing and debt, making it difficult to
monitor general government debt trends.
Although the authorities are aware of these
limitations and have plans to address them,
they have not yet set a target date for moving
to a consolidated general government
presentation.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

ANNEX II: WORLD BANK-IMF COLLABORATION
(As of September 1, 2011)

Background
The working relationship between the IMF and
the World Bank in Indonesia is acknowledged
by both sides to be very strong with joint
working programs in many areas and close

coordination through frequent meetings
between resident offices and with
headquarters missions, including the Article IV
consultation.

Key Areas with Joint Programs
Budget


The reform agenda for budget and
treasury remains a high priority for
both institutions. The strategic
framework for joint work is built into
joint Bank/Fund budget missions.
Currently, the Bank support is being
provided through the GFMRAP
program (recently restructured), trust
funds and DPLs, with elements in
support of (a) efficient treasury
operations including accounting
reforms, improved in˗year budget
disbursement, and regulatory reform;
(b) improved linkages between
planning and budget preparation
through the implementation of a
medium term expenditure framework,
and the enhancement of budget
flexibility at the service delivery level;
and (c) improved capacity for budget
oversight through organizational
reform. In addition to the Fund’s
overall strategic guidance, the Fund
team takes the lead in the
development of the budget reform
strategy, treasury single account, and

cash planning. Moving forward this
assignment of responsibilities is
expected to continue.
Taxation


Taxation is a priority for the Fund and
the Bank with improving tax revenues
an important issue for both
macroeconomic security and the
investment climate. The Fund has a
longstanding program of support for
the tax department in Indonesia. This
program has, in recent years, focused
on tax policy and donor coordination,
with donor coordination quite
important given the size of support for
a solid program of tax reform in
Indonesia. The Bank involvement is
now also quite large. Support for tax
administration reform will largely be
executed through the Program for
Indonesian Tax Administration Reform
program which is now being prepared.
The participants will check with their
respective colleagues but generally
anticipate that the current division of
labor will continue.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 3

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

INDONESIA

Asset Liability Management


The Bank and Fund have been leading
an effort to improve asset liability
management, including at the Treasury
and Debt Management Office of the
Ministry of Finance and Bank
Indonesia. We envision that the Bank
and Fund team will continue to work
together as needed.

Financial Sector


The Bank has focused on broad
monitoring of the financial sector with
special emphasis on issues that are
important for the investment climate
(as part of the Development Policy
Loan series). The Bank has engaged
more actively on nonbank financial
sector policy and most recently on
access to finance. The Fund has
concentrated on the banking system
per se, with emphasis on bank
regulation and supervision. A joint
Bank/Fund FSAP was completed last
year that may lead to changed
priorities and work programs going
forward.

Statistics


4

The Bank has a major program with
the statistics agency that was launched
in 2010. The program is being
designed to focus on improvements in
key statistical series that should
improve the ability to understand the
Indonesian economy, executed
through an institution wide approach,
i.e., including significant IT and
personal/institutional reforms. There is
a need for quick wins while the
longer˗term reform plays out, and the
Fund has indicated that it is prepared
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

to continue to assist in the area of
government finance statistics.
Macroeconomics


The Fund continues to take the lead in
macroeconomic areas, with the
Article IV and other missions, staff
reports and policy notes on arising
issues, including the stance of fiscal,
monetary, and exchange rate policies,
the credibility and effectiveness of
monetary policy, macrofinancial
linkages, and how events in the global
economy are likely to impact
Indonesia. The Bank has also begun to
play a larger role, including on
macroeconomic monitoring and
capacity building, and there is an
ongoing need for close coordination
with the Fund. The Bank team has been
assisting the Ministry of Finance, Fiscal
Policy Office, to improve
macroeconomic monitoring and
forecasting capacity. In addition, the
Bank team has been working on longer
term macro/fiscal capacity and
forecasting with the planning agency.

These threads of work are expected to be
continued by both parties, and regular
meeting(s) will explore other ways to improve
existing synergies. These include keeping each
other informed about ongoing work, and
requests to each other in areas of interest and
through periodic meetings. Issues being
addressed include, for the Fund, the impact of
structurally high inflation rates and associated
higher volatility on real interest rates; and for
the Bank, the link between macro/fiscal policy
and real economic outcomes, potential
growth, employment, and longstanding
problems in the implementation and
effectiveness of government spending.

ANNEX III: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK1
(As of August 11, 2011)
Asian Development Bank (ADB) cumulative
loans to Indonesia reached $26.5 billion as of
end˗December 2010. In 2009, the ADB
approved a total of $2,184 million or
16.5 percent of the total loans approved by the
institution for the year. More than 90 percent
of the loans approved in 2009 were provided
through four policy based operations. Two
loans supported the Government’s efforts to
mitigate the effects of the global economic
crisis. The remaining two continued to support
the Government’s medium term term reform
agenda in capital market development, the
investment climate, public financial
management, and poverty alleviation. 1
ADB is preparing a Country Partnership
Strategy with the Government of Indonesia to
cover the period 2011−2015. The strategy will
be aligned with the Government’s
medium˗term development plan (RPJM)
for 2010−2014 as well as the Masterplan for
the Acceleration and Expansion of Indonesia
Economic Development 2011−2015. It will

support the government’s objectives to
achieve higher levels of sustainable growth
and to foster social development. It is
anticipated that assistance will be provided in
the core areas identified in ADB’s Long Term
Strategic Framework—transport, energy,
financial sector, natural resource management,
water supply and sanitation, and education.
Support for good governance, gender equity,
environmental sustainability and regional
cooperation will be encouraged in all sectors
where relevant. Special emphasis will be
provided to assist the Government to
implement its climate change action plan.
Between 1967 and 2010, ADB provided
504 Technical Assistance grants to Indonesia
amounting to $282.9 million. The TA grants
were financed from ADB’s Technical Assistance
Special Fund, the Japan Special Fund, and
other sources. Measured by cumulative TA
approvals, Indonesia is the second largest
recipient of TA support from the ADB.

INDONESIA

ANNEX IV: STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Indonesia’s macroeconomic statistics are broadly adequate to conduct effective surveillance.
National accounts: Quarterly GDP data are published in a timely manner for both expenditure and production sides.
The annual national accounts have 2000 as the base year. The estimates are based on a limited set of indirect indicators
of uncertain quality. Some sectors are influenced strongly by seasonality, and seasonally adjusted data are prepared but
not published. In addition, no survey of nonfinancial services is prepared. The Fund has recommended: (i) development
of a system to continuously update the census of businesses; (ii) introduction of comprehensive annual establishment
surveys for nonfinancial services industries; (iii) publication of annual GDP estimates, including a time series of at least 20
years; (iv) development of a set of annual supply and use tables (SUTS) starting from 2000; and (v) enhancing the
convergence exercise on trade data between Bank Indonesia (BI) and Ministry of Finance (MOF).
Price statistics: Price statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance.
Government finance statistics: Available government finance data suffer from a number of weaknesses, in terms of
classification, coverage, and timeliness. Data on the budget of the central government are available with a one month
lag, but subnational (provincial and local) government data are available only with a lag of two years, and the quality of
this data is variable. Problems in budget and accounting systems have been compounded by the recent decentralization
initiatives, which have shifted substantial resources to the subnational governments. Substantial efforts are in train, and
significant progress has been made to overcome these problems, ranging from the planned adoption of advanced
accounting and statistical standards, to the introduction of best practice budget management processes, and the
development of computerized financial management information systems.
Against this background, the MOF and the Ministry of Home Affairs are committed to keeping the requirements of fiscal
statistics at the forefront of ongoing fiscal reforms, so as to make better statistical monitoring one of the goals of the
current efforts. The coverage and timeliness of public debt statistics is generally adequate. The new expenditure
classification introduced in the 2005 budget, is generally consistent with the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001
(GFSM 2001) on functional codes and classification, although the data are compiled on a cash basis.
The authorities have committed to adopting GFSM 2001 standards. To this end, the Fund staff has recommended in the
short term: (i) establishment of a register of all extrabudgetary units; and (ii) inclusion of the economic codes consistent
with the GFSM 2001 in the chart of accounts to ensure that general government units report all transactions and
balances over which they exert control. Over the medium term, priority should be given to (i) establishing the underlying
reporting arrangements necessary to obtain timely preliminary data for local government statistics; and (ii) developing
GFSM 2001 operating statements, statements of sources and uses of cash, and partial balance sheets, all of which should
be published on the MOF websites. Currently a system has been set up to allow for an automatic conversion of budget
files to GFSM 2001 data; however, these data are yet to be published on the MOF website.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INDONESIA

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

Monetary statistics: Good quality monetary statistics are compiled by BI on a timely basis. With STA assistance,
BI has developed an integrated database from which alternative presentations of monetary statistics can be
drawn to meet the needs of BI and the Fund. To strengthen monetary statistics, STA missions have also
recommended the expansion of the coverage of monetary statistics to include mutual funds. Additional
challenges include timely revisions of published banking sector data after supervisory verification.
Balance of payments: Trade data are affected by some significant shortcomings. While customs sources utilized
by the BI are considered generally reliable, coverage of merchandise trade flows is insufficient. Also, when the
online reporting system for exports and imports was introduced in 2004, the historical series were reconstructed
only as far back as 2003. As a result, prior to 2003, balance of payments statistics are not entirely consistent with
the national accounts estimates. Exports and imports volume data, and consequently trade deflator data, is
incorrectly computed as aggregate indexes that do not weight sub category volumes by their economic value.
For the capital and financial account, the methodological basis for the compilation of FDI data needs substantial
improvement. Inflows are currently calculated based on loan disbursements to companies that have foreign
equity using a fixed ratio to estimate equity inflows. Surveys conducted by BI to collect FDI data have a low
response rate and the coverage of the directory of enterprises should be improved. Other areas that need
improvement include the recording of trade credits and the asset data for portfolio investment and other
investment transactions. The magnitude of the errors and omissions item has been significant at times and
appears to be related to the methodology used, for instance, for unrecorded assets in the financial account.
Financial transactions data have not been reconciled with changes in the International Investment Position (IIP).
An annual IIP is compiled, but the underlying data are weak in several areas, notably for FDI, and published data
should include a higher degree of disaggregation (only main items are reported). External debt statistics have
improved considerably with the introduction of an External Debt Information System (EDIS) in 2002 and the
recent initiative to publish monthly indicators. However, improvements are still needed with respect to
components of private corporate sector data, particularly in distinguishing between scheduled and actual debt
service, in estimating the accumulation/reduction of private sector payments arrears, and in estimating
rescheduling and debt reductions received by the private sector from external creditors.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Indonesia
October 7, 2011
The information below has become available following the issuance of the staff report. It
does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
Similar to other emerging markets, Indonesian financial markets have recently been
experiencing large sell-off pressures as concerns about advanced economies intensified (see
chart). On the back of heavy foreign selling, the Jakarta equity index plunged by almost
13 percent and Indonesia’s EMBI and CDS spreads rose 110-125 bps from end-August to
October 3, in line with other emerging markets. At the same time, the rupiah has depreciated
by about 4 percent against the U.S. dollar. Bank Indonesia (BI) intervened to stabilize the
exchange rate and both BI and the government purchased government securities to support
the bond market. Indonesian markets have recovered in the last week, with both bonds and
the rupiah retracing most of their initial losses. Local 10-year government bond yields, for
example, have fallen back to near their end-August levels, after rising 119 bps during
September 9-22.
2.
Headline inflation eased to 4.6 percent y/y in September from 4.8 percent in August
reflecting a larger-than-expected fall in food prices after Ramadan and base effects related to
the timing of the holiday relative to last year. Core inflation has slowed to 4.9 percent y/y
from 5.2 percent y/y in August. The trade surplus widened to US$3.8 billion in August, from
US$1.2 billion the previous month. Exports (f.o.b.) grew 37.1 percent y/y, while import
growth (c.i.f.) slowed to 23.7 percent y/y in August.
3.
On October 3, 2011, BI issued a new regulation requiring that export proceeds and
external borrowing in the form of non revolving loan agreements and debt securities be
received by domestic banks. However, there is no minimum period for which these funds
need to be kept at a domestic bank, implying that firms are free to transfer them offshore
immediately afterwards. The regulation will not take effect until January 2012, and there will
be a one-year transition period.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
October 21, 2011

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Indonesia
On October 7, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Indonesia.1
Background
Continuing the impressive performance during the global financial crisis, Indonesia’s economy
expanded 6.1 percent in 2010 and accelerated to 6.5 percent in the first half of 2011. Growth
has also become more balanced, with investment adding to consumption and exports as the
main engines of growth. In the absence of a significant further deterioration in global conditions,
GDP growth is projected to remain robust at about 6−6.5 percent in both 2011 and 2012,
increasingly driven by investment, which is offsetting a lower contribution from net exports.
Headline inflation has eased in recent months on softening food prices, but upward pressure on
core inflation is expected to continue. At end˗2010, rising food prices had pushed CPI inflation
to 7 percent; exceeding Bank Indonesia’s (BI) 4−6 percent target range. Headline inflation
started to ease since February 2011, falling to 4.6 percent in July, as good local harvests and
increased rice imports helped hold down food prices. Core inflation rose steadily through 2010
and into 2011, reaching 5.2 percent in August 2011. The future path of food prices will play a
major role in the evolution of inflation. Nevertheless, a closing output gap, accelerating credit

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

2
growth and elevated inflation expectations from an anticipated reduction in energy subsidies are
projected to push core inflation higher in the second half of this year and into 2012.
The current account surplus has declined, but capital inflows have increased. Exports have
been robust, buoyed by higher commodity prices and growing demand from major emerging
market partners. Imports are also rising rapidly, in line with strengthening domestic demand.
Strong growth prospects, solid macroeconomic fundamentals, and the potential for a ratings
upgrade to investment status have continually led to large portfolio inflows, boosting bond and
equity prices to all time highs. Foreign direct investment inflows have picked up and become
broader based, and should provide greater support for the balance of payments. International
reserves have more than doubled from the 2008 level, increasing to $125 billion by end
August 2011. The rupiah has appreciated about 5 percent against the dollar from end 2010 to
end August 2011, and external debt spreads have narrowed.
Indonesian banks continue to be profitable and are generally well capitalized. In line with the
findings of the 2010 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), capital adequacy ratios
remain high at 17.5 percent, and asset quality is satisfactory, with the nonperforming loan ratio
at about 3 percent as of March 2011. BI has made progress towards the FSAP recommendation
to establish a legally mandated Prompt Correction Action (PCA) mechanism, but the adoption of
the Financial System Safety Net (FSSN) law remains outstanding.
Since October 2010, BI has used a wide range of instruments to stem mounting inflationary
pressures and strong foreign demand for its sterilization instruments. The central bank raised its
policy rate by 25 basis points to 6.75 percent in February 2011, after holding it unchanged at a
historical low of 6.5 percent since August 2009. Reserve requirements on both local currency
and foreign currency deposits have also been raised. BI has successfully shifted the
composition of inflows away from central bank bills (SBI) by extending the holding requirement,
lengthening the maturity of issues, and introducing longer maturity nontradable term deposits
available only to banks.
The moderate fiscal stimulus provided in 2009 was reduced in 2010. The 2010 central
government budget deficit was 0.6 percent of GDP, well below the government’s revised budget
deficit target of 2.1 percent, reflecting ongoing problems in implementing spending programs.
Public debt to GDP fell to 27 percent, one of the lowest among G20 countries. The overall
budget deficit in 2011 is projected to increase slightly to about 1.25 percent of GDP, reflecting
higher energy subsidies.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for cautious policymaking, which has
underpinned a strong macroeconomic performance during the global crisis and a favorable
growth outlook. Given Indonesia’s strong fundamentals, significant policy buffers, and vigorous
domestic demand, Directors agreed that the risks from a deterioration in global economic

3
conditions appear to be manageable. Looking ahead, improved infrastructure, better targeted
social spending, and deeper structural reforms will be crucial to lifting the long-term prospects
for growth.
While taking note of the authorities’ view that inflation may not be an immediate concern,
Directors nonetheless considered that Bank Indonesia should be prepared to tighten monetary
policy, in view of high credit growth and a planned reduction in energy subsidies. The timing of
such move should, however, be mindful of global developments and the likely impact on capital
flows. Directors suggested a combination of policy rate increases, macro-prudential measures,
and liquidity absorption to tighten monetary conditions, and encouraged the central bank to
focus its communications on its commitment to the inflation target.
To improve the effectiveness of monetary policy, Directors suggested that the central bank’s
operational framework be adjusted to link interbank rates to the policy rate more effectively
while promoting money market development. Directors also recommended strengthening the
central bank’s financial resources by increasing the share of marketable securities in its balance
sheet and replenishing its capital base.
Directors agreed that domestic financial conditions are generally sound. They welcomed the
authorities’ progress in implementing the recommendations of the 2010 Financial Stability
Assessment Program and efforts to reinforce supervisory oversight through a new risk-based
bank rating system. In this regard, Directors noted that the adoption of the Financial System
Safety Net law remains key to an improved framework for crisis management and resolution.
Directors commended the authorities’ commitment to strong public finances and a prudent fiscal
policy. They encouraged the authorities to phase out poorly targeted subsidies with a view to
creating room in the 2012 budget for needed infrastructure and other priority expenditures.
Noting that implementation constraints still hamper policy flexibility, they called for further
improvements in budget execution and public financial management, as well as tax reforms that
could create the budgetary space for high-priority social expenditures.
Directors considered that further structural reforms are critical for higher potential growth and
the achievement of the authorities’ longer-term development targets. In this regard, they
recommended renewed efforts to improve regulation, strengthen governance, and bolster the
business climate.

Statement by Aida Budiman, Alternate Executive Director for Indonesia
and Iss Savitri Hafid, Advisor
October 7, 2011
The Indonesian authorities would like to thank the IMF team for the fruitful dialogue during
this year’s Article IV consultation and the useful inputs from the Staff Report and the
Selected Issues paper. They welcome staff’s appraisal on the resiliency of the economy,
garnered from adoption of prudent macroeconomic and financial measures, a series of
structural reform policies, combined with a transition toward a more democratic and stable
political system.
Recent Economic Development and Outlook
1.
Despite the bleak prospect of the global economy which has intensified recently, the
Indonesian economy continues to demonstrate an impressive progress as well as stability.
The sources of economic growth have been more balanced as investment activity gains
momentum, owing to stronger economic fundamentals and improved business climate.
Government expenditure will continue to play an important role in providing stimulus to the
economy, while at the same time preserving a prudent fiscal position. Nevertheless, the
recent downward revision of global outlook has led the authorities to lower its GDP and
inflation forecast, in particular for 2012. In 2011 and 2012, the GDP is forecasted to reach
6.6% and 6.5%, respectively; while for the inflation rate is 4.9% and 5%, respectively.
2.
These developments have placed the economy on a better footing. The level of
reserves has reached an all-time high, in which this position is sufficient to cover more than 7
months of imports and external debt services of the Government. Furthermore, external debt
has been on a steady downward path, including public debt, in line with the medium-term
fiscal target to build up fiscal space. The composition of capital inflows has furthered
improved as reflected by FDI flows surpassing net portfolio flows beginning second-half of
this year. This change in the nature of inflows to more longer-term flows will further enhance
the resilience of the economy. In addition, financial stability continues to be preserved, as
reflected by the high level of capital adequacy ratio and the markedly lower level of NPL.
Likewise, government bond price and stock market index are on a rising trend. Backed by
sound fundamentals, the Rupiah exchange rate has been on an appreciating trend, alleviated
the temporary pressures due to global sentiment triggered by uncertainty of the US and Euro
area economic prospects. Taking into account favorable growth prospects, Indonesia’s credit
rating has been upgraded to one notch below the investment grade by two rating agencies this
year and one rating at the end of last year.
3.
The authorities are cognizant of the challenges that lie ahead and broadly agree with
the staff’s assessment on the Indonesian economy. The authorities’ top priority is to sustain
the growth momentum without compromising stability, while improving the quality of
growth.

2
Monetary policy
4.
The objective of monetary policy is always to achieve and safeguard price stability.
The policy responses toward inflationary pressures would need to be assessed carefully in
view of the uncertainties in the global economy, massive capital inflows and the possibility
of capital reversal, as well as gaps in market development. The policy rate remains a part of
the policy tool-kit to maintain macroeconomic and financial stability, in addition to other
monetary and macro-prudential policies, including continued efforts to strengthen monetary
policy operation and promote financial deepening. While authorities acknowledge the
possibility of higher inflation pressures in 20121, two important factors should be taken into
consideration in formulating policy responses to inflation going forward. First, any
adjustment in administered prices should be viewed as a one-time and temporary shock.
Second, authorities are also concerned over the possibility of a more pronounced global
economic slowdown, hence less pressure from commodity and oil price. Due to these two
considerations, the authorities will focus their attention to limit any second-round effects of
this adjustment to headline inflation. Authorities have successfully demonstrated their ability
to achieve this during the episode of food price increase in 2010.
5.
Various indicators have been and will be closely monitored to ensure that price
stability remains in check. To track demand side pressures, the decomposition of core
inflation has been analyzed. The result shows that the current uptrend in core inflation has
been mainly due to gold. Core inflation excluding gold as well as non-food core inflation
excluding gold, are still in the low levels of 4.2% and 4% respectively, lower than core
inflation of 5.2%. In addition, inflation expectation indicators also indicate a declining trend
in public expectations for both for 2011 and 2012. Authorities will also ensure sufficient
supply of food and its smooth distribution, while strengthening the communication strategy
to ensure that public expectation is well-anchored. These efforts will be complemented by
continued use of the exchange rate as an economic shock absorber, which so far has been
effective in containing inflationary pressures and impact of capital flows.
6.
Expansion in credit growth is important to boost the economic capacity. Unlike the
situation in 2009 where credit growth was dominated by consumption loan, the rapid credit
growth in 2010 and 2011 has witnessed broad-based expansion, including in working capital
and investment loans. Taking into account the share of credit, most funds are channeled to
productive sectors which in turn will boost the economic capacity and address infrastructure
bottlenecks.
Fiscal Policy
7.
The authorities are firmly committed to ensuring fiscal sustainability as improving
public finance management. This is of utmost importance in order to achieve the mediumterm fiscal strategy of attaining public debt consolidation and improving the quality of
government expenditure. Public debt to GDP has steadily declined from 36.9% in 2007 and
is targeted to fall to less than 24% at the end of 2011. On the revenue side, authorities
continue their efforts to increase the tax revenue ratio, including through broadening tax base

3
and continuing administration reform agenda. Meanwhile, the improvement in the budget
structure will be addressed through implementation of a gradual phase-out of subsidies,
reallocation of spending towards infrastructure and alleviation of poverty and unemployment.
To support these efforts, authorities are currently seeking TA programs that may help to
design the blueprint and implementation strategy for strategic government projects.
8.
Efforts to adhere to good corporate governance in fiscal operation are in progress. To
enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of budget management, the authorities are
implementing a multi-year performance-based budgeting (PBB) and a medium-term
expenditure framework (MTEF) in the period 2010-14. Further, a Presidential Decree on
procurement was adopted in 2010 to maintain governance while aiming to streamline
procurement-related regulations. However, owing to the transitional period and operational
guidelines, the new regulation contributed to the current low execution of government
spending. Realizing this condition, corrective actions have been taken, among others by
introducing an incentive system to ministries and government institution that are capable of
optimizing their budget by March 2011. In addition, the Ministry of Finance has delegated
some authority for budget virement to Treasury regional offices and line ministries.
Financial Sector Policy
9.
The authorities have sustained efforts to optimize the intermediary function of the
financial system while continuously maintaining the financial stability. Indonesia has
undertaken intensive financial sector reform and is in the stage of implementing the FSAP
recommendations. In this regard, the authorities welcome TA programs to help address
concerns in the priority sectors. Likewise, reforms in the banking sector, such as Basel II
implementation and principle-based supervisory approach, have progressed according to the
timeline. On the capital market side, the Bapepam-LK continues to implement the five-year
development plan with five area for development, namely increasing accessible and efficient
source of fund, improving ease of transaction, promoting a stable, resilient and liquid
industry, enhancing fair and transparent regulatory framework which guarantees legal
certainty, and promoting a credible, reliable international standard infrastructure.
10.
Despite the sound and solid banking condition, the authorities continue to strengthen
the Crisis Management Framework. In view of the pending enactment of the Financial
Stability Safety Net Law, a concerted effort has been made to establish a national crisis
management protocol, and is in the progress of harmonizing this protocol among related
agencies. In the banking sector, Bank Indonesia has revamped the system for individual
banking and sharpened the Prompt Corrective Action measure with the introduction of Risk
Based Bank Rating (RBBR) to preemptively determine bank supervisory status and exit
policy. In terms of the government bond market, the Ministry of Finance and Bank Indonesia
have taken a coordinated initiative to provide back-stop mechanism as it deems necessary, to
avoid excessive volatility in the market. This initiative is considered important as bond price
fluctuation has significant role in building up market expectations.

4
Structural reform
11. Understanding the need to address the infrastructure bottlenecks, the government has
strengthened the provision of government guarantees and direct contribution for
infrastructure projects, as well as accelerated and streamlined the procurement process. A
clear target for infrastructure development is set annually. The 2011 target is projects related
to national food security, transportation connectivity, communications, energy security, water
resource and flood management. Efforts towards achieving investment grade status are in
progress. The authorities have intensified the engagement with investors by actively
improving communication channels and data transparency. Based on the IIF’s 2011
assessment, the Investors Relations Unit of Indonesia has been ranked first, together with a
few other emerging market countries. This positive achievement is expected to contribute to
increased longer-term financing from abroad, including those supporting the most needed
infrastructure financing, and at better cost.
To conclude, Indonesia has successfully weathered the deep global crisis in 2008 and
registered continued notable economic growth. This progress is a result of intensive reform
and prudent macroeconomic policies which lays a solid foundation to entail sustainable
economic growth. In years to come, the authorities envisage to improve the quality of
growth, aiming to bring more people out of poverty line so as to deliver equality in social
welfare. Indonesia also resolves to play a greater role in cushioning a potential global
economic slowdown, together with other EMDCs.
