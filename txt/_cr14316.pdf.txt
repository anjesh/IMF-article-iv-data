STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
August 13, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context: The fiscal and external positions further deteriorated in 2013, reflecting
declining commodity export prices and substantial fiscal relaxation, and international
reserves declined to 3½ months of imports. However, strong fiscal tightening is being
undertaken in 2014, and higher bank reserve requirements in late 2013 are also helping
to curb demand pressures. More consolidation will be needed over the medium term to
entrench fiscal sustainability and safeguard external stability. In line with FSAP
recommendations, efforts to strengthen the monetary policy framework and financial
sector resilience are ongoing. Structural competitiveness is being reinforced.
Focus of the consultation: The consultation focused on measures to strengthen fiscal
sustainability and external stability, as well as policies to enhance financial sector
resilience, structural competitiveness and inclusive growth.
Policy recommendations:


Both revenue and expenditure measures will be needed to support fiscal
consolidation efforts. Successful consolidation will also require establishing an
appropriate fiscal framework and a clear fiscal anchor consistent with sustainability.



Further credit tightening will be needed if fiscal adjustment proves insufficient to
secure macro stability. Also, FSAP recommendations to strengthen bank capital and
the financial sector regulatory framework should be rigorously implemented to
enhance financial sector stability.



Improving the business environment and labor market flexibility would enhance
structural competitiveness and inclusive growth.

Past surveillance: During the 2013 Article IV consultation, Executive Directors noted
that Suriname’s heavy reliance on commodity exports has exposed fiscal and external
vulnerabilities, and they stressed the need to build up buffers, promote fiscal
sustainability, strengthen the financial sector, and enhance competitiveness. However,
the fiscal position deteriorated further in 2013, and progress in strengthening monetary
and financial sector policies and public financial management slowed. There are however
signs of renewed policy momentum in 2014.

DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
1.
Suriname’s macroeconomic situation
continued to deteriorate in 2013 as the long boom
in oil and gold prices appeared to come to an end.
With gold and oil prices falling below recent peaks, the
large fiscal and external sector exposures to the mineral
sector, together with inadequate adjustment of
domestic (particularly fiscal) policies, led to further fiscal
and external sector deterioration in 2013 and a
significant decline in international reserves. Thus, the
main challenges are to strengthen institutions and
adjust policies to reverse the recent deterioration and
avoid undermining the stability of the fixed exchange
rate.1
2.
Growth continued to be robust in 2013,
supported by fiscal relaxation and strong credit
growth, while inflation remained low. Staff estimates
GDP growth of 4 percent (Figures 1 and 2 and Table 1).
In contrast with recent years, however, export volumes
declined, subtracting from GDP growth. Gold export
volume (close to two-thirds of total) contracted by
1½ percent in 2013, down sharply from positive growth
of almost 6 percent in 2012, as gold prices declined.
Moreover, exports of the other two main commodities
continued to be weak—contracting 5 percent for
aluminum and increasing by 1¼ percent for oil—
reflecting persistently low aluminum prices and limited
oil reserves. Inflation remained low in 2013, averaging
2 percent, but has picked up to almost 3 percent in May
2014 largely because of higher food and fuel prices.

dollarization have remained broadly stable. Banking system profitability declined slightly in 2013,
with the return on equity falling 3 percentage points to 21¾ percent. Bank capital adequacy
remained broadly unchanged at 12½ percent of risk weighted assets, above the regulatory
10 percent minimum, but well below the regional average of 20 percent. NPL ratios are somewhat
high but declined from 6.2 percent in 2012 to 5.9 percent in 2013. Bank liquidity appears adequate,
with liquid assets accounting for almost half of total assets and about 87 percent of short-term
liabilities.
4.
Unsterilized foreign exchange intervention also helped tighten the monetary stance.
Central bank sales of foreign exchange to maintain the stability of the fixed exchange rate, lacking
adequate tools for sterilization, reduced reserve money and broad money growth alongside the
decline in international reserves, with a resulting tightening of domestic financial conditions that
supported other measures—particularly the increase in reserve requirements—to contain domestic
demand pressures.

However, the fiscal deterioration that began in 2012 continued in 2013 (Figure 5 and
Table 2). An attempt in March 2013 to limit government spending proved short-lived in the absence
of broad political consensus, and the fiscal balance

of 6¼ percent of GDP in 2013. In addition, staff’s

data indicate that a 3¼ percentage point of GDP

expenditure stayed broadly flat. Notable increases in current spending were for the wage bill, which
increased one percentage point to 9½ percent of GDP as a result of a 10 percent public sector wage
hike, and goods and services expenditure (G&S) which also rose one percent of GDP. However, a
part of the increase in G&S could be misclassified capital expenditure or could be capturing some of
the changes to the statistical discrepancy. Subsidies and transfers rose by ½ percent of GDP while
interest payments also increased by ½ percent of GDP.

And the external balance also declined considerably (Figure 6 and Table 3). The current
account balance fell 7¼ percentage points to a deficit of 4 percent of GDP in 2013, primarily
reflecting the substantial adverse impact of falling gold prices on exports.2 In addition, domestic
demand pressures manifested in strong goods imports, which offset the beneficial impact of
declining imports for large projects on the current account balance. Alongside, international reserves
declined to 3½ months of imports. REER appreciation has eroded much of the gains from the 2011
devaluation, and CGER type estimates together with the large fiscal policy gap suggest that the
exchange rate may now be quite strong (Box 1).

Box 1. Suriname: External Competitiveness
A range of indicators suggest that the exchange rate may now be quite strong:



REER appreciation slowed significantly in

2013, but much of the competitiveness gains from
the devaluation in January 2011 had already been
eroded. Since the devaluation the Surinamese dollar
has appreciated about 10 percent in real effective
terms, reflecting in part the high inflation experienced
in the immediate aftermath of the devaluation, and
also the relative strength of the US dollar to which the

gold prices. Nominal export growth has outpaced the
Caribbean average of close to 7½ percent, largely due
to one commodity, gold, which currently accounts for
12

7 percent ten years ago. Consequently, Suriname has
than doubled its share in Caribbean exports. However,
declining gold prices have depressed exports recently.



CGER-type methodologies suggest that the

exchange rate may be somewhat on the strong
side. The external sustainability (ES), equilibrium real
exchange rate (ERER), and macroeconomic balance
(MB) approaches all suggest a moderate
overvaluation. The ES approach is adjusted to allow
for a buildup of net foreign assets in line with staff’s
medium term projections, to reflect
the high dependence of Suriname

7.
The outlook for 2014 is for a modest slowdown in economic activity, reflecting anemic
commodity prices and policy tightening. In addition to the higher bank reserve requirements
implemented in 2013, substantial fiscal tightening is underway. Recent data indicate a fiscal deficit
(cash basis) for January–May of 1¾ percent of annual GDP, about 1¼ percent of GDP lower than for
the same period of 2013, together with a substantial reduction in the stock of arrears, and additional
measures are also planned for the second half of 2014. Thus, domestic demand pressures are
expected to decline this year. Together with WEO forecasts of additional decline in the gold price
and flat oil prices, staff’s baseline projection is for GDP growth to decline to 3 percent in 2014.
Falling gold prices, reduced aluminum production, and additional imports related to the
construction of a new gold mine will also cause the current account deficit to widen to about
4½ percent of GDP in 2014. Inflation is likely to remain contained assuming international food and
fuel prices stay subdued and policy settings remain consistent with the continued stability of the
exchange rate regime.
8.
Over the medium term growth is expected to increase moderately, with the external
balance swinging back into surplus as mining operations expand. WEO projections indicate
slightly rising gold prices over the medium term, and two large international gold mining projects
are expected to start operations over 2017–18, thus boosting production and exports. A new oil
refinery will improve the oil trade balance by over 2 percent of GDP from 2015 onward. On this
basis, GDP growth is expected to rise to a peak of about 5 percent by 2018, while the current
account balance improves to a surplus of about one percent of GDP over the medium term. Upside
potential for growth could be harnessed if significant progress were achieved in strengthening
structural competitiveness.
9.


Risks to the outlook broadly appear tilted downwards:
While gold prices have fallen below recent peaks, downside risks still appear to dominate as
price levels remain well above long run historical averages. Strengthening U.S. activity and the
associated exit from quantitative easing are also likely to dampen investor demand for gold, and
moreover, the expected moderation in China’s growth rate is likely to have a dampening impact
on a broad range of commodity prices. Moreover, rising global supply could reduce oil prices
beyond that projected over the medium term. Given Suriname’s large exposures, declines in
gold and oil prices would pressure the fiscal and external positions and potentially delay or
cancel planned investments in the mineral sector, dampening the outlook for growth.
 In a severe shock scenario where gold prices immediately fall to $1000/ounce, the large gold
mining projects are cancelled, and there is no policy response beyond that incorporated in
the baseline, GDP growth and the fiscal and external balances fall, and there would be a
large decline in international reserves. Incorporating policy tightening to mitigate reserve
loss would imply a larger output loss than estimated for the shock scenario.

¹ In the shock scenario, staff assumed that the gold price drops to $1000/oz at the end of July 2014, resulting in the cancelation of
planned gold mining projects. No additional policy response is assumed.

 While an adjustment of the currency under a severe scenario could improve competitiveness
and the valuation of foreign currency denominated fiscal revenues, these effects would be
short-lived if not supported by policy tightening to minimize price and wage pressures. The
banking system weathered the 2011 devaluation well, with NPL ratios rising by only
0.1 percentage point, but that was in the context of rising commodity prices which
supported buoyant activity. With falling commodity prices the adverse effects on NPLs and
bank capital could be significantly larger (further dampening GDP growth), even though
banks’ long net foreign exchange position provides protection from direct exchange rate
risk. FSAP stress test results suggest that in a scenario where (i) GDP growth declines one
percentage point; (ii) fiscal deterioration causes a sharp increase in arrears that elevates the
NPLs of government suppliers; and (iii) the exchange rate is adjusted; NPLs could increase by
around 5 percentage points, which would require about 0.7 percent of GDP to bring
regulatory capital to the minimum requirement of 10 percent.


Inward spillovers from protracted slower growth in advanced or emerging countries are unlikely
to have a major impact on Suriname’s economy, provided they only have a limited impact on
commodity prices. Growth was robust despite recent global economic weaknesses because
commodity prices remained high. Nevertheless, there could be some confidence effects if the
medium term global outlook were to worsen substantially.



The banking system has limited international links and low domestic levels of leverage, and has
been resilient to international financial spillovers. However, if policy settings weaken, the
resulting deterioration of the macro-environment could elevate risks to financial stability, further
undermining the growth outlook.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SURINAME



Fiscal policy implementation risks are also substantial ahead of next year’s elections. Public debt
rollover risks are moderate: short term debt constitutes only 16 percent of total debt, and gross
financing needs are about 10 percent of GDP in 2014. However, rollover risks are projected to
rise over the medium term as the debt-GDP ratio increases, with gross financing need rising to
13 percent of GDP by 2019.



Upside risks on the other hand, particularly over a longer horizon, could originate from
unexpectedly strong global growth raising commodity prices, geopolitical events that boost
gold prices, the discovery of large oil or mining reserves, or structural reforms that promote
growth in the non-commodity sector. Notably, several international oil companies are actively
exploring the offshore area, and there is a sense of optimism that these efforts will bear fruit.

10.
The authorities were more optimistic about the outlook and balance of risks. They
expected medium-term growth to be somewhat higher than projected by staff, given the numerous
large projects in train, and they considered the downside risks to gold prices presented by staff to
be overstated. Also, they expected that the new oil refinery would sufficiently insulate the external
balance and fiscal revenues from any adverse impact of declining oil prices. In addition, they
emphasized their commitment to adopting all necessary policy measures to maintain macro
stability.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
There was consensus that strengthening macroeconomic stability and the growth outlook would
require substantial policy tightening and a broad range of institutional reforms. Strong fiscal
consolidation is needed to achieve sustainability and also contribute to external stability. An
appropriate fiscal framework would insulate policy making from commodity price volatility and enable
countercyclical policy. Additional credit tightening will be needed if fiscal adjustment proves
insufficient to ensure external stability. Implementing plans to develop indirect tools of monetary policy
would provide additional instruments for managing domestic demand. FSAP findings indicate that
strengthening financial sector stability will require building capital buffers, building a liquidity
management framework, and strengthening prudential standards and the intensity of supervision.
Legislation is pending to overhaul the business environment and strengthen structural competitiveness.

A. Fiscal Consolidation to Strengthen Sustainability and Macro Stability
11.
Suriname has a large long run fiscal sustainability gap, which indicates the need for
substantial consolidation (Figure 7). 3 While estimates of public mineral wealth are subject to
considerable uncertainty (total deposits are unknown, and their long run price outlook is volatile),
staff estimates, based on a conservative valuation approach, indicate a fiscal sustainability gap of

3

The fiscal sustainability gap is the total amount of fiscal measures that (if immediately implemented) would assure a
non-explosive path for government debt over the long run.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SURINAME

about 12½ percent of GDP.4 Clearly it is not feasible to attempt such a large adjustment in the near
term, as it would open up an untenably large output gap. However, delaying adjustment increases
the total amount of measures required for sustainability. Staff estimates of the optimal fiscal path
that balances the twin conflicting objectives of closing the sustainability and output gaps suggest
that targeting a fiscal surplus of at least 1½ percent of GDP in 2019 would be desirable. This would
require an overall medium term adjustment effort estimated at about 8½ percent of GDP, as the
effect of declining commodity prices on revenues would also need to be offset. Substantial
frontloading of adjustment is advisable to help safeguard external stability, and in light of stillfavorable cyclical conditions and the downside risks to the commodity price outlook. Given the scale
of the required adjustment effort, both revenue and expenditure measures would be needed.
12.
Against this background, the authorities are implementing strong consolidation in
2014, though there are risks ahead of next year’s election. Expenditure controls and tax
collection efforts were strengthened from January. Moreover, the wage bill in the first half of 2014
declined relative to that of 2013, as

Kanda and Mansilla (IMF WP/14/121) describes the analytical approach underpinning the estimates. Staff’s revised
estimates incorporate revisions to the data on mineral revenues. The estimate excludes the impact of aging pressures

13.
Moderate additional consolidation beyond 2014 is built into the baseline fiscal
projections. Staff projects a further decline in the deficit to 2½ percent of GDP by 2019, supported
by continued spending restraint and a pickup in mineral revenues as new mines commence.
Alongside, public debt rises to over 40 percent of GDP, partly reflecting the effect of external
borrowing to fund the purchase of equity stakes in two international gold mining projects.5
14.
However, there was consensus that achieving fiscal sustainability would require more
measures over the medium term. Staff noted that the consolidation envisaged under the baseline,
while substantial, fell short of the levels that would be desirable for sustainability, and the downside
risks to the outlook warrant stronger consolidation. Notably, the 2019 fiscal balance under the
baseline is about 4 percent of GDP lower than the 1½ percent of GDP surplus that would be
desirable for sustainability. Also, land sales would provide one-off revenues for a few years, but not
improve the underlying structural fiscal position. Deeper reforms and strong resolve will be needed
to reduce the wage bill and other public spending to more sustainable levels over the medium term.
Also, with central bank financing near legal limits and banks reportedly cautious about increasing
holdings of public debt, domestic financing constraints could bind in an adverse scenario,
potentially leading to another buildup of arrears.6 The authorities indicated that they would be
implementing deeper reforms over the medium term with precise details being discussed, but
noting that some politically sensitive measures would have to wait until after the elections.

currently higher than regional averages, thus enhancing the business environment. The authorities
also indicated renewed momentum on customs administration reform, stalled in 2013 by opposition
from the business community. Currently, poor valuation of imports reportedly results in
30–40 percent losses in customs duty. The ASYCUDA World software, including the risk
management module, is to be introduced by the end of 2014, together with increased physical
inspection of containers. Finally, enhancing tax collection efforts would also help boost revenues,
notably in the informal gold mining sector.
16.
The authorities emphasized that spending restraint would be a major part of the
adjustment effort, while protecting the most vulnerable segments of society. Staff agreed, and
observed that while there is room to enhance the efficiency of public capital expenditure, the bulk of
expenditure measures should fall on current expenditures other than those for the social safety net.
In this regard, public wage moderation would strengthen consolidation efforts and help enhance
competitiveness by restraining private sector wage growth in line with productivity. Moreover, the
targeting of electricity and water subsidies should be improved, as they are sizable at over 2 percent
of GDP and largely benefit the upper-income urban population. A comprehensive database of
recipients of social benefits across relevant Ministries would provide a sound basis for upgrading
and improving the targeting of the social safety net.7 More generally, all subsidies should be made
explicit in the fiscal accounts to improve clarity about the trade-offs in public spending. Efforts to
contain spending on goods and services should also be intensified, as G&S has increased much
faster than other expenditure categories in recent years.
17.
Staff reiterated that the fiscal framework needs improvement in light of the sensitivity
to mineral sector developments. A clear fiscal anchor that promotes long run sustainability, based
on a target for the non mineral balance (which has the advantages of transparency and relative
robustness to political pressures), is needed to support consolidation efforts. Also, medium-term
expenditure ceilings consistent with the fiscal anchor would complement efforts to contain
expenditure pressures, aid fiscal planning, and strengthen the top-down aspect of the budgeting
process. Staff urged the authorities to continue efforts in this area, including the full installation of
the Integrated Financial Management Information System, passage of a Public Financial
Management (PFM) law that incorporates a fiscal anchor and corresponding expenditure ceilings,
and passage of the sovereign wealth fund (SWF) law to help improve revenue management and
provide the institutional basis for saving future surpluses from mineral revenues. The authorities
were receptive to staff’s recommendations, but were not yet ready to specify a time-bound agenda
or specific plans for establishing a fiscal anchor.
18.
The establishment of a national health care and pension system commenced in mid
2013 and is to be completed in 2014, but the overall fiscal impact remains uncertain. Public
social assistance for health care will now be in the form of paying premiums for private sector

provided health insurance (rather than directly paying hospital bills of patients), while pensions will
be defined-benefit on a PAYG basis.8 The authorities reiterated their objective to introduce the
reforms in a budget-neutral fashion, but also acknowledged that overruns could not be ruled out.
Data so far indicates significant savings on health expenditure, as premium payments to cover the
young, old, and unemployed segments of the population have been below previous public spending
on health care. Enhanced monitoring and benchmarking of hospital billing practices has also
reduced costs and intensified competition among hospitals. However aging pressures could present
significant risks to sustainability. Health premiums are likely to increase as the share of the aged in
the population increases. Moreover, the authorities’ estimates indicate that pension contribution
rates would need to rise from 3 percent to 28 percent over the long run to keep the system
sustainable. Staff expressed doubts about the sustainability of such a high contribution rate, and
suggested that more flexibility should be to be built into pension benefit parameters to allow
greater scope to mitigate the effects of aging. The authorities however considered that the
projected contribution rates were feasible.

B. Monetary Policy to Safeguard the Fixed Exchange Rate
19.
The fixed exchange rate regime remains an appropriate anchor for policy, but
substantially tighter fiscal policy settings need to be delivered to support the current level of
the currency. There was agreement that given the relatively thin foreign exchange market and
substantial capital flows, a fully flexible exchange rate would likely be subject to considerable
volatility, with corresponding sizable shocks to competitiveness and confidence that would be
difficult to manage given institutional capacity constraints. Staff noted, however, that the burden of
substantial macroeconomic adjustment to achieve consistency with the fixed exchange rate regime
lies primarily with addressing remaining fiscal imbalances. Moreover, the large exposure of the
external position to commodity price swings indicates a need to strengthen institutional capacity to
be able to manage a more flexible exchange rate regime in the future.
20.
Staff encouraged the authorities to phase out the existing multiple currency practices
(MCPs) as soon as practicable. The exchange rate regime gives rise to MCPs arising from (i) the
existing spread of more than 2 percent between the buying and the selling rates in the official
market for the government’s foreign exchange transactions; and (ii) the potential spread of more
than 2 percent between the official rates for government transactions and those in the commercial
markets. The authorities responded that any change to the exchange rate regime could potentially
be disruptive, and would have to be done at an opportune time.
21.
Although the exchange rate regime constrains monetary policy, there is scope to
dampen credit growth if needed to enhance external stability. Capital controls in place create

Financing of health care premiums will involve employer and employee contributions for employed persons, with
government paying premiums for the other members of the population. Health insurance coverage would be
provided by the private sector in all cases. For those on the government program, the government negotiates a
fixed-term group insurance contract with a private provider after a competitive bidding process.

SURINAME

some scope for an independent monetary policy. International reserves have been broadly stable in
2014 and are adequate under traditional benchmarks, but they are slightly below levels considered
adequate under more stringent risk-weighted benchmarks, indicating need for a more aggressive
policy stance. Thus, there was agreement that further steps would be taken to moderate credit if
fiscal adjustment proves inadequate to stabilize the external position. Possible short term measures
could include further increases in reserve requirements (although they are already high), sales of
treasury bills to mop up bank liquidity, intensified bank supervision to enhance compliance with the
existing rules and with the new capital rules coming into effect, and intervention in the foreign
exchange market. Staff also encouraged the authorities to implement plans to commence regular
Treasury bill auctions in Q4 2014, complemented by the other elements needed for open market
operations (OMO), including a liquidity monitoring/management framework and standing facilities.
This would strongly improve the monetary toolkit.

C. Strengthening Financial Sector Resilience
22.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ efforts to strengthen supervision in view of increased
macro risks. Nonperforming loans could rise further and capital positions deteriorate in an adverse
scenario. Data on house prices is not available, but there may be rising risks in the real estate sector,
a particular concern given that banks, insurance companies, and pension funds all have large
exposures to mortgages, and a significant portion of mortgages are in foreign currency . Moreover,
even non-mortgage loans are reportedly often collateralized by property, further increasing the
exposure of the financial sector to real estate. Although loan-to-value (LTV) ratios are reportedly
moderate at around 50 percent, the valuation of collateral is subject to substantial uncertainty,
raising potential risks. Comprehensive data on exposures to government is not available and would
be an important source of non performance in the event fiscal issues are not resolved. Analysis by
the FSAP points to other vulnerabilities including the presence of currency mismatches and high
sensitivity to credit and concentration risk. In view of these risks, and in line with the
recommendations of the accompanying FSAP (Box 2), the authorities are implementing plans to
strengthen the macro-prudential framework and improve monitoring of risks, including enhanced
data gathering and analysis and the recently established financial stability unit in the central bank.
23.
There was agreement that capital buffers need to be strengthened. Capital adequacy
ratios for the banking system, at 12½ percent of risk weighted assets, exceed the regulatory
minimum of 8 percent, but are well below the regional average of 20 percent, and it would be
prudent to increase buffers in light of the macro risks. The FSAP’s stress tests suggest that some
banks could become undercapitalized in an adverse scenario. The authorities on July 1 implemented
stronger capital, loan classification and provisioning standards (incorporating a more rigorous
treatment of real estate collateral), and intend to intensively monitor their implementation, which
will require capital planning on the part of banks.
24.
Several important reforms are in the pipeline. Draft regulations on corporate governance,
risk management, internal audit, and consolidated supervision are well advanced. The Insurance Act,
which will finally give the central bank legal powers in the sector and the ability to monitor and
address real estate exposure and other risks in the sector, is now before Parliament. Major efforts
are underway on credit reporting, development of the payment system, deposit insurance,
accounting and auditing, and secured transactions. There is also a need to complete plans to
restructure three small state-owned commercial banks and one small nonbank financial institution.
In line with the FSAP, the mission encouraged the authorities to prepare a comprehensive plan to
coordinate and integrate the various reform initiatives to ensure timely implementation given
limited resources.
25.
There was consensus that the central bank should continue on its path to modernize
and develop its credibility as a financial sector supervisor. This will require developing a strong
financial sector strategy and building key supervisory and crisis resolution skills. Changes to its legal
framework, including extending its ability to resolve banks, would be made in line with FSAP
recommendations.

26.
Progress in improving the AML/CFT regime is ongoing. The Caribbean Action Task Force
(CFATF) reported in May 15, 2014 the positive efforts aimed at closing the gaps in Suriname’s
AML/CFT framework, including the enactment of the State Decree on Indicators of Unusual
Transactions. CFATF asked authorities to report back in November on outstanding
recommendations, namely legislative actions to criminalize insider trading and market manipulation,
and to give effect to international sanctions. On May 20, 2014, the authorities passed the Capital
Market Act and the Law on International Sanctions, which the CFATF will assess in the coming
months. Staff urged the authorities to address all remaining deficiencies in a timely fashion.
Box 2: Suriname: 2014 FSSA Main Findings and Recommendations
The financial sector remains relatively underdeveloped and shows signs of vulnerability in the face of
elevated macro risks. Credit intermediation levels are low, lagging behind countries with a similar economic
structure and per capita incomes. Banks are generally profitable and liquid, but profitability has been
declining over the last five years. The capital adequacy ratio of the banking sector is above the required
minimum (8 percent), although three small banks are undercapitalized. Stress tests suggest vulnerabilities in
the banking system owing to high levels of loan concentration and inadequate accounting for nonperforming
loans. The central bank has limited tools to conduct monetary policy and monitor/manage system liquidity.
Weak data is a pervasive problem in effective risk analysis and supervision; improving data collection and
analysis is a high priority for the CBvS.
The authorities are taking steps to strengthen prudential standards and supervision, though
significant implementation challenges remain. The new Banking and Credit System Supervision Act took
effect in 2011 and the central bank has made progress in improving on-site examination and adopting the
CAMELS approach. On July 1 2014, a capital adequacy rule was adopted to raise the minimum capital
adequacy ratio to 10 percent and strengthen provisioning requirements. However, a large number of other
regulations and guidelines covering liquidity, consolidated supervision, corporate governance, and external
audit have been drafted but not yet issued and challenge the authorities’ resources and capacity to
implement them. Enforcement of compliance with rules remains an on-going challenge.
Capital buffers and prudential regulation should be improved. Specifically, the new capital adequacy
rules should be implemented in a timely fashion and the supervisor should work intensively with banks that
need to build up capital to ensure there is no slippage. Small state-owned commercial banks should be
restructured and banks’ compliance with loan classification rules should be improved.
A liquidity management framework should be established. As a first step, the operation of T-bill auctions
system should be accelerated. The central bank should develop liquidity monitoring standards for banks, and
establish a systemic liquidity monitoring and forecasting framework with a contingency plan for emergency
liquidity in foreign currency in place.
The central bank should continue to develop its credibility and effectiveness. A coherent financial sector
development strategy needs to be developed and communicated with industry and the public. The central
bank should also build up its human resources and skill sets to effectively oversee the on-going reforms.
Changes to its legal framework including extending its ability to resolve banks are required as well.
Supervision over non-bank financial institutions should be enhanced. In particular, the Insurance Act
should be enacted to enhance the central bank’s supervisory authorities. A resolution strategy for pension
plans that are unlikely to meet regulatory requirement should be developed.

D. Enhancing Structural Competitiveness
27.
There was agreement that enhancing growth prospects would require strengthening
the business environment (Figure 8). With commodity prices cooling, a more supportive business
environment is needed to boost productivity growth, particularly in the non-mineral sector. While
Suriname scores well on some indicators such as airport capacity and import costs the latest World
Bank Doing Business Indicators suggest room for improvement in several areas such as starting a
business, enforcing contracts, protecting investors, and registering property.9 The Competitiveness
Unit in the office of the Vice President has spearheaded the preparation of several pieces of draft
legislation that would overhaul the regulatory framework for business—which in some cases is
decades out of date. Draft legislation on competition policy, limited liability company formation, and
electronic gazettes to reduce company startup costs has been approved by the Council of Ministers
and is before Parliament, while others such as those on intellectual property, consumer protection,
and electronic transactions are in the pipeline. 10 Staff welcomed these efforts and urged early
parliamentary passage of the reforms.
28.
Staff stressed that promoting job-rich inclusive growth will require taking decisive
steps to increase labor market flexibility, supported by a well targeted social safety net.
Employment protection regulations are among the most stringent in the world, and the 2012–2013
World Competitiveness Report ranked Suriname 137 out of 144 countries in hiring and firing
practices. Such strong employment protection discourages job creation, and may have encouraged
the growth of the informal sector, which is reportedly large. At the same time, however, there is no
unemployment insurance, and the existing social programs focus on helping the poorest segments
of society. Thus, the cost to an individual worker of being dismissed is severe, ensuring that there
would be considerable political resistance to efforts to reduce employment protection. The mission
therefore recommended that reductions in employment protection should be complemented by
establishing well designed unemployment insurance.

E. Other
29.
The authorities continue to progress in strengthening macroeconomic data quality.
The data are now broadly adequate for surveillance, and welcome progress is being made toward
introducing a monthly indicator of economic activity and producing expenditure side GDP estimates.
However, there are still quality and coverage gaps, complicating diagnosis. Detailed fiscal outturn
data are sometimes not available. There is a need for timely and comprehensive data on social
indicators for enabling social policy design to support inclusive growth, which will likely require the
9

As pointed out in an independent evaluation of the Doing Business survey, care should be exercised when
interpreting these indicators given subjective interpretation, limited coverage of business constraints, and a small
number of informants which tend to overstate the indicators' coverage and explanatory power (see
www.worldbank.org/ieg/doingbusiness).
10

All new companies in Suriname are required to announce their formation via paper-based gazette. Because of the
high cost and long-waiting time of this process, it is one of the key barriers for start-up of companies. Electronic
gazette will allow companies to publish information online and significantly reduce start-up costs.

allocation of additional resources. Important data such as GDP and labor statistics come with some
lag. Staff encouraged the authorities to complete plans to upgrade the statistics law and to further
strengthen the statistical system, including by strengthening reporting requirements for surveyed
institutions.

STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
Suriname has suffered significant external shocks as the commodity super-cycle ends,
requiring a strong policy response to maintain macro stability. Recent declines in gold and oil
prices, together with insufficient fiscal policy response, led to fiscal and external sector deterioration
in 2012–13 and a significant decline in international reserves. Thus, the main challenges are to
strengthen institutions and adjust policies to reverse the recent deterioration and avoid
undermining the stability of the fixed exchange rate.
31.
Given the large fiscal sustainability gap and recent deterioration in macro
performance, the authorities’ resolve to implement strong fiscal consolidation is welcome.
Targeting a significant fiscal surplus over the medium term would be appropriate to entrench
sustainability, bolster the external position, and build up fiscal buffers for countercyclical policy and
intergenerational saving. Commendably, the authorities are implementing substantial tightening for
2014, and are committed to additional measures to restore fiscal health over the medium term.
However, policy implementation risks are significant ahead of elections in mid-2015, and the
uncertainties inherent in elections imply risks to the medium term policy agenda of the authorities.
32.
Successful fiscal consolidation will require revenue and expenditure measures beyond
those envisaged for 2014, supported by an appropriate fiscal framework. On the revenue side,
establishing a revenue enhancing VAT, together with the modernization of customs and the entire
tax structure are key for achieving sustainability. In addition, expenditure restraint should be a major
part of the adjustment effort, while protecting the most vulnerable segments of society. Efforts in
this area should include public wage moderation, improved targeting of electricity and water
subsidies, streamlining of spending on goods and services, and prioritization of capital projects.
Also, plans to set up a national pension and health care system, while laudable, should be
implemented in a fiscally sustainable fashion. Establishing a fiscal anchor consistent with
sustainability, supported by medium term expenditure ceilings, would support consolidation efforts.
33.
Monetary tightening should be deployed to safeguard the external position if fiscal
measures prove inadequate to contain demand pressures. In this context, the authorities should
consider the use of available monetary policy instruments, including reserve requirements, sales of
treasury bills, and intervention in the foreign exchange market to achieve this objective if needed.
Staff encourages the authorities to press ahead with plans to establish open market operations, thus
providing additional monetary policy tools to help maintain macroeconomic stability.
34.
The fixed exchange rate regime remains an appropriate anchor for policy, but
substantially tighter fiscal policy settings need to be delivered to support the current level of

the currency. Given the relatively thin foreign exchange market and substantial capital flows, a fully
flexible exchange rate would likely be subject to considerable volatility, with corresponding sizable
shocks to competitiveness and confidence that would be difficult to manage given institutional
capacity constraints. Thus, limiting exchange rate volatility would serve the country well. Staff
considers that the burden of substantial macroeconomic adjustment to achieve consistency with the
fixed exchange rate regime lies primarily with addressing remaining fiscal imbalances. Moreover,
given the large exposure of the external position to commodity price swings, there is a need to
strengthen institutional capacity to be able to manage a more flexible exchange rate regime in the
future.
35.
Article VIII issues. Suriname is an Article VIII member and maintains two MCPs. Staff does
not recommend the approval of these MCPs as there is no clear timetable for their removal.
36.
The progress being made to upgrade financial sector resilience is welcome. As noted by
the FSAP, the financial sector remains relatively underdeveloped and shows signs of vulnerability in
the face of elevated macro risks. Stress tests suggest vulnerabilities in the banking system owing to
high levels of loan concentration and inadequate accounting for nonperforming loans. The central
bank has limited tools to conduct monetary policy and monitor/manage system liquidity. Weak data
is a pervasive problem in effective risk analysis and supervision; improving data collection and
analysis is a high priority for the central bank. Commendably, stronger capital regulations have been
put in place, and a major overhaul of the banking sector legislative and regulatory framework is
nearing completion, while the financial sector infrastructure is also to be strengthened by the
establishment of a credit bureau, a modern payment and settlement system and a deposit insurance
scheme. Similar efforts are being contemplated to strengthen the insurance sector regulatory
framework, and there has been significant progress recently in strengthening the AML/CFT regime.
37.
It would be important to craft a coherent financial sector development strategy to
continue to develop the credibility and effectiveness of the central bank. The central bank
should also build up its human resources and skill sets to effectively oversee the on-going reforms.
In addition, building a liquidity management framework should be a priority. Changes to its legal
framework including extending its ability to resolve banks are required as well.
38.
Momentum is increasing on policies to enhance structural competitiveness. Notably,
the draft legislation spearheaded by the competitiveness unit, if passed, will modernize the business
environment and support stronger growth and economic diversification. Also, labor market flexibility
and job-rich inclusive growth could be improved by some relaxation of employment protection
regulations together with well designed unemployment insurance.
39.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Suriname be conducted
on the standard 12-month cycle.

of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a
probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff
views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Nonmutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Appendix I. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Suriname’s public debt sustainability risks have risen significantly. Public debt jumped
8 percentage points to 30 percent of GDP in 2013, and is expected to climb further to 40 percent
of GDP by 2019. Though this level of debt is still moderate the sharp increase is cause for
concern. The deterioration largely reflects the rapid worsening of the primary deficit and the
moderate consolidation efforts assumed in staff’s baseline. However, about 6¾ percentage
points of the projected increase in debt over the medium term reflects borrowing for the
purchase of equity stakes in two large gold mining projects. The debt path is robust to a variety
of shocks to growth, interest rates, the exchange rate, and the primary balance, though a
combined shock could raise projected debt to around 51 percent of GDP and financing needs to
18 percent of GDP in 2019.
Risks arising from the maturity of public debt are low, as short term debt constitutes a small
fraction of total debt. A spike in short term debt in 2013 due to a sharp rise in recourse to the
central bank overdraft facility was eliminated in early 2014 by rationalizing government accounts
with the central bank, using government deposits to payoff liabilities. Risks arising from the
currency composition of debt have risen, and foreign currency denominated debt is now over
half of total debt. Importantly, fiscal consolidation will be key to mitigating the risks to the
baseline scenario—medium term projections using historical averages for the macroeconomic
and fiscal paths indicate a substantial decline in public debt, emphasizing the need to return to
the stronger fiscal stance prevailing in the recent past. Moreover, projections using a constant
primary balance indicate a further rise in projected debt to over 50 percent of GDP, with elevated
financing needs as well.
Gross financing needs rise significantly under the baseline but remain moderate. The DSA
indicates that gross financing needs will be 10.1 percent of GDP in 2014—up from an average of
1.6 percent for 2003–2011—and will rise to 13 percent of GDP in 2019, below the 15 percent
benchmark. The heat map highlights rising risks in gross financing needs under real interest rate
shocks.
The forecast track record shows a degree of pessimism in forecasts of real GDP growth,
suggesting some possibility that the public debt path realization could be somewhat lower than
staff forecasts, but this effect is unlikely to be significant. In the aftermath of the devaluation in
2011, staff inflation forecasts for 2012–13 were well above the actual, but staff has since lowered
its forecasts for inflation over the medium term to correct this error. Average forecast error for
the primary balance is close to zero. Given the robustness of the debt path to macro shocks
based on historical precedent, any forecast bias is unlikely to be substantial. The projected fiscal
adjustment looks realistic in comparison with other countries, and indeed the low percentile rank
(81 percent) in the 3-year average level of the CAPB, corresponding to -1.5 percent of GDP,
confirms that the country has more room to implement stronger fiscal measures if necessary.

External debt rises to a peak in 2016, reflecting government external borrowing to finance the
purchase of equity in two gold mining projects. Beyond 2016, however, external debt falls as the
current account balance improves, ending at 43 percent of GDP in 2019. Other external
borrowing from multilateral sources to support reform and infrastructure projects is projected to
remain strong, while external borrowing from the private sector declines over the medium-term
as several large projects are completed. Medium-term projections for the balance of payments
depend crucially on the outlook for gold prices, as gold constitutes close to two-thirds of
exports. With the current outlook for gold prices, the current account is expected to revert to a
surplus in 2017 following the completion of large gold-related FDI projects and the completion
of Staatsolie’s oil refinery which will substitute for a significant portion of oil imports.
Suriname’s external debt ratio is robust to interest and growth shocks, but sensitive to large and
permanent current account and exchange rate shocks. The primary source of a large current
account shock would be falling gold prices. An exchange rate depreciation would also raise
external debt levels substantially. However, the additional risk from the planned market
borrowing of government stemming from devaluation alone is limited, because the funds will
finance projects related to gold which generate U.S. dollar revenue streams.

Appendix II. Authorities’ Response to Past IMF Policy
Recommendations
IMF 2013 Article IV Recommendations
Fiscal Policy:
(i) Substantial adjustment, requiring both revenue and
expenditure measures, is needed to strengthen
macroeconomic stability and ensure sustainability.
Notably:

Tighten public spending. In particular, public wage
should be moderated and subsidies should be better
targeted. Diversify revenue base including
implementation of VAT.
(ii) Establish a sound fiscal framework considering the
sensitivity of revenues to mineral sector developments.
This should comprise a fiscal anchor consistent with
sustainability, medium-term expenditure ceilings, and a
Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF).
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy:
(i) Monetary tightening should be deployed to
safeguard the external position if fiscal measures prove
inadequate to contain demand pressures.
(ii) The monetary authorities should press ahead with
efforts to establish indirect instruments of monetary
policy.

Structural Reforms:
(i) Structural reforms to improve the business
environment and increase the efficiency of public utilities
will be needed to enhance competitiveness.
(ii) Labor market flexibility could be improved by some
relaxation of employment protection regulations.

Financial Sector:
(i) Plans to substantially reduce state ownership in the
banking sector should be carefully designed and
managed to ensure a smooth transition.
(ii) Efforts to strengthen financial sector resilience and
reduce dollarization should continue.

46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Authorities’ Response
(i) The authorities have implemented strong
consolidation in 2014, including both revenue and
expenditure measures. However, deeper reforms such
as VAT and improved targeting of subsidies are to be
tackled after the 2015 elections.
(ii) The authorities were receptive to staff’s
recommendation of establishing clear fiscal
framework, but have not yet taken concrete action to
establish a fiscal anchor. The SWF law is currently
stalled.

(i)
The central bank tightened monetary policy on
September 16. It raised reserve requirements on both
domestic and foreign currency deposits by 5
percentage points to 30 percent and 50 percent,
respectively, as part of efforts to constrain credit
growth and help strengthen macroeconomic stability.
(ii) T-bill auction as a first step to establish indirect
monetary policy framework is in progress although
the implementation is delayed to Q4 2014 /Q1 2015.
(i) Legislation is pending to overhaul the business
environment. Draft laws on competition policy,
limited liability company formation, and electronic
publication of the registration of new firms have been
approved by the Council of Ministers and are before
Parliament. Other important legislation in the pipeline
includes laws on intellectual property, consumer
protection, and electronic transactions.
(i)
The authorities are still discussing with the
relevant banks on how to divest government shares
to reduce potential negative impact on market.
(ii) The authorities passed new capital rules on July
1, 2014 to raise minimum CAR ratio to 10 percent for
all banks and require banks to raise provisions by an
estimated SRD40 million.

Nonfinancial Relations with the Authorities
Exchange rate arrangements: The national currency is the Surinamese dollar (SRD), which replaced
the Surinamese guilder in January 2004 at a conversion rate of 1,000 guilders per SRD 1. The de jure
exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. In accordance with a July 1994 presidential
decree (Resolution and Besluit of 1994), the exchange rate is determined based on the demand and
supply of foreign exchange. With the amendment in 2000 ("Wijzigingen Resolutie") the Central Bank
of Suriname was mandated to establish, at its discretion, maximum and minimum rates. The
exchange rate of the Surinamese dollar vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar in the official market remained stable
until January 20, 2011, when the authorities devalued the currency by 20 percent to SRD 3.3 per U.S.
dollar and set a band of SRD 3.25–3.35 per U.S. dollar, within which all official and commercial
market transactions may take place. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is
classified as a stabilized arrangement. Suriname is an Article VIII member and maintains two multiple
currency practices (MCPs) arising from the spread of more than 2 percent between the buying and
the selling rates in the official market for government transactions and also from the possible spread
of more than 2 percent between these official rates for government transactions and those in the
commercial markets that can take place within the established band. Staff does not recommend the
approval of these MCPs as there is no clear timetable for their removal.

Last Article IV consultation: The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board
on September 7, 2013 (IMF Country Report No. 13/340). Suriname is on the standard 12-month
consultation cycle.
Participation in the GDDS: In July 2004, the IMF officially announced Suriname’s formal
participation in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS).

RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of May 31, 2014)
1.
In 1980 Suriname joined the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), the country’s
largest multilateral lender. As of May 2014, Suriname’s outstanding debt to the IADB stood at
US$388 million.
2.
Through the IADB Country Strategy with Suriname 2011–2015, the government of
Suriname expanded its partnership for development. The strategy calls for a notable increase in
lending, from US$103 million (in the previous Country Strategy period, 2007–2010), to about
US$300 million. The main focus is on modernizing public governance structures, diversifying the
economy, and expanding social benefits. The priority areas include: (i) agriculture, (ii) energy,
(iii) education, (iv) financial sector development, (v) public investment management, (vi) social
protection, and (vii) transport. Dialogue will continue on other areas in need of strengthening: water
and sanitation, disaster risk management, tax administration, health, private sector development,
and natural resources and environmental management with a view to possible additional lending
support.
3.
The active investment loan portfolio, of which 52.9 percent is disbursed, consists of 10
sovereign guaranteed loans that total US$200 million. The median age of the loans in the entire
portfolio is 2.4 years. The 2014 pipeline will support reforms in agriculture and the business climate
while collaboration in the energy and financial sectors continues. The 2014 pipeline includes one
investment loan for US$40 million, and five programmatic PBLs for up to US$70 million.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of June 3, 2014)
The World Bank Group recently re-engaged with the Surinamese authorities after 30 years
hiatus. In September 2011, Suriname became the 183rd member of the IFC and 14th in the Latin
America Region. In October 2012 the Board of Directors also endorsed the Interim Strategy Report
(ISN) which will guide engagement in the country over the next two years. It has been agreed with
the government that initial World Bank support would focus primarily on providing knowledge
services for institutional strengthening and capacity building for the Government and the Central
Bank.
The ISN was successfully implemented. The Government and the Bank Group are currently
engaged with the preparation of a Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) expected to be finalized by
the end of calendar year 2014.
Lending Activities
IFC financed a trade financing line with a leading local commercial bank.
Technical Assistance
Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes – Accounting and Auditing (ROSC): Based
on findings of the ROSC completed in 2012, a $300,000 grant for the Development of Accounting
and Auditing Standards and Practices has been secured. The recipient of the grant is the Ministry of
Finance and the Central Bank of Suriname.
The Reserves Advisory & Management Program (RAMP) first initiative was completed. A
proposal for further work was submitted for Government’s approval.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provided to the Fund are broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, but has
shortcomings, reflecting capacity constraints and limited resources. The authorities are making
efforts to improve the quality and dissemination of economic data, notably through the central
bank’s website. In 2014, the Central Bank publishes an Advance Release Calendar (ARC) for
monetary and external sector statistics, and updates regularly the National Summary Data Page
(NSDP) on its website, although timeliness remains an issue with some important data, such as
GDP and labor statistics. The authorities also need to compile social indicators for enabling social
policy design to support inclusive growth.
National accounts: With extensive support from CARTAC, the General Bureau of Statistics (ABS)
has improved the quality and coverage of production-based GDP and has made progress in the
reconciliation of the national accounts with the Balance of Payments and the compilation of
expenditure-based GDP. One milestone recently accomplished by the ABS was the compilation of
household final consumption expenditure. ABS has also reconciled the data on imports and
exports in the expenditure-based GDP estimates with the Balance of Payments for 2012. ABS will
carry out the exercise back to 2007 in consultation with the Central Bank and plans to publish
expenditure-based GDP in 2014. ABS has also published on its website the component weights of
the CPI sub-indices as recommended by the 2013 Article IV report.
Government finance statistics: The Ministry of Finance (MoF) primarily compiles the fiscal data in
national definition and concepts which could lead to confusion in analyzing in GFSM formats. By
the same token, although the effort that Central Bank of Suriname (CBvS) made to convert the
fiscal statistics into 2001 GFSM format is welcome, the estimates are often different from what
MoF provides. The operations of central government data (in 2001 GFSM format) on a monthly
basis are available in the CBvS website, often with a few months lag. Staff notes that the limited
data are generally due to capacity constraint, and strongly encourages publishing the detailed
fiscal data on a timely basis for a thorough analysis. The MoF is upgrading the IT system to help
collect detailed fiscal data. Separately, the authorities provide public debt data on a regular basis.
However, the available public debt statistics cover only debt contracted or guaranteed by the
central government, and as a result, it is difficult to capture the buildup or payoff of arrears in the
current debt recording system.
Public finance statistics are limited to those for the central government. The institutional coverage
of fiscal statistics needs to be broadened to the nonfinancial public sector so as to better assess
the fiscal risks associated with total public sector debt. The actual number of public enterprises
remains difficult to determine, and most of these enterprises do not produce accounts on a timely
basis.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SURINAME

Monetary and financial statistics: The Central Bank (CBvS) uses the standardized report forms
(SRFs) to regularly report data for the central bank and other depositary corporations (ODCs) on a
monthly basis. The CBvS does not report the SRF for other financial corporations. There have been
important improvements to quality and timeliness of monetary and financial statistics. The surveys
for the central banks and ODCs and depository corporations are disseminated on the CBvS’s
website within five weeks of the reference month.
Suriname does not report financial soundness indicators (FSIs) to the Statistic Department (STA)
for dissemination on the IMF’s FSI website. The authorities are encouraged to adopt the FSI
methodology for reporting Suriname’s FSIs to STA on regular basis.
External sector: The Central Bank has made important progress in the compilation of quarterly
balance of payments and International Investment Position (IIP) statistics. The current classification
and methodology of the Balance of Payments Manual, Fifth Edition (BPM5) is adopted to the
extent that national data sources have permitted and the authorities are looking forward to the
transition to the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position
Manual (BPM6). With the aim of embracing new statistical initiatives, the CBvS reported for the first
time in 2013, quarterly IIP pertaining to 2012 for dissemination purposes in the Fund’s
International Financial Statistics (IFS) and national publications. The authorities also reported to the
World Bank in June 2014 for the first time the Quarterly External Debt Statistics (QEDS), which are
available on its website.
Going forward, the CBvS should formulate a medium term strategy to improve the compilation
and coverage of: a) foreign direct investment; b) services (freight, insurance and pension services,
financial, and other business services), with particular emphasis on travel through the
implementation of a recurrent survey in coordination with the Suriname Tourism Office, and;
(c) remittances through non-formal channels, using the annual household survey by Suriname
Statistics Office (ABS). Estimates of the components of the financial account (especially private
external debt) also need to be improved.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Suriname participates in the GDDS.
III. Reporting to STA
Suriname currently does not report fiscal statistics for inclusion in either International Financial
Statistics, or the Government Financial Statistics Yearbook.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Approved By

Charles Enoch (WHD) and Vikram Haksar (SPR)

Staff wishes to highlight some developments supplementary to the staff report issued to
the Board. The passage of the minimum wage law alters the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
Recent available high frequency indicators are broadly in line with staff
projections. Bank credit growth to the private sector has continued trending down to
13.4 percent (y/y) in July from 15 percent in April. June data show that public spending
remained contained, amounting to about 11.7 percent of annual GDP in H1 2014
compared to the projected 28.2 percent of GDP for the full year. International reserves
remain broadly stable, and stood at about US$800 million in end-August, close to
4 months of imports. Foreign exchange market conditions have remained orderly.
Inflation has risen moderately to almost 4 percent in July, primarily reflecting
movements in food and fuel prices.
2.
In line with staff’s recommendations, the authorities announced a phased
withdrawal of electricity subsidies on September 7. Electricity tariffs for large
corporations and foreign embassies are to rise from US$0.06/kWh to market rates
(US$0.26/kWh), while rates for households will rise from US$0.06/kWh to
US$0.08/kWh, implying that households will still enjoy a sizable electricity subsidy. The
authorities have indicated that further adjustments to electricity subsidies for
households could come after the completion of a study on its distributional impact.
The exact timing for the transition to the new tariff rates was not mentioned.
3.
The authorities introduced a minimum wage on August 28, effective
January 2015, starting around the bottom end of the public sector wage scale,
but rising by 43 percent in the next two years. A tri-partite labor council was also
established to make future recommendations about the minimum wage and other
labor market policies. Sizable data gaps on wage distribution make it difficult to
accurately assess the impact of this measure, but the authorities’ view is that the initial
level will not significantly affect the distribution of wages in the public and formal

SURINAME

private sector, which has some support in staff’s past assessments though these are hampered by
data constraints.1
4.
However, the substantial increases planned for the next two years raise concerns,
particularly given recent external pressures and fiscal slippages, and staff would advise
deferring further increases. Moreover, the ability of the new labor council to maintain the
minimum wage at a level that does not undermine competitiveness is untested. Staff are also
concerned that this measure could hurt job creation among the low-skilled or drive some lowwage activities underground, which would be detrimental to the very people the law is designed
to help. It would be advisable to gather more data about the distribution of wages to inform the
decision on the appropriate minimum wage.

Details of staff’s past assessment can be found in chapter V of the 2013 Selected Issues Paper, as well as the
2013 Staff Report and chapter II of the 2014 Selected Issues Paper.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
October 31, 2014

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Suriname

On October 1, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Suriname.
Suriname’s macroeconomic conditions weakened in 2013 as gold and oil prices declined. With
those prices falling below recent peaks, the large fiscal and external sector exposures to the
mineral sector continued their deterioration in 2013, along with a significant decline in
international reserves. Thus, the main challenges the authorities are addressing continue to be to
strengthening institutions and adjusting policies to reverse the recent deterioration and strengthen
external stability.
Growth is estimated at a robust 4 percent in 2013, supported by fiscal relaxation and strong
credit growth. In contrast with recent years, however, export volumes declined, subtracting from
GDP growth. Gold export volume growth (three-fifths of total export of goods) contracted by
1.3 percent in 2013, down from positive growth of almost 6 percent in 2012, as gold prices
declined. Moreover, exports of the other two main commodities continued to be weak—
contracting 5 percent for alumina and increasing by 1.3 percent for oil—reflecting persistently
low alumina prices and limited oil reserves. Inflation remained low in 2013, averaging 2 percent
but has picked up to about 3 percent in May 2014 largely because of higher food and fuel prices.
Following increased reserve requirements in September 2013, bank credit growth to the private
sector has declined from its peak of 20 percent (y/y) in October 2013 to 13.4 percent in July
2014. Deposit and credit dollarization have remained broadly stable. Banks are profitable and
liquid. Bank capital adequacy remained broadly unchanged at 12.4 percent of risk weighted
assets, above the regulatory 8 percent minimum, but well below the regional average of
20 percent. Non-performing loan (NPL) ratios were somewhat high at 5.9 percent in 2013.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
However, fiscal deterioration continued in 2013. The overall fiscal balance fell by 2.8 percentage
points of GDP to a deficit estimated at 6.8percent of GDP. Much of the deterioration reflected a
significant decline in mineral revenues, but fiscal expenditures also increased. Strong fiscal
consolidation is being implemented in 2014, and the fiscal deficit is expected to decline to
3.7 percent of GDP this year. Public debt is rising but remains relatively low at about 30 percent
of GDP.
The external balance has also declined considerably. The current account balance fell
7.3 percentage points to a deficit of 4 percent of GDP in 2013, primarily reflecting the substantial
adverse impact of falling gold prices on exports. In addition, domestic demand pressures
manifested in strong goods imports, which offset the beneficial impact of declining imports for
large projects on the current account balance. Alongside, international reserves declined to
3.4 months of imports.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Suriname’s robust economic growth and commended the
authorities for their recent consolidation efforts to address the widening fiscal and external
imbalances, and the progress made on financial sector reform. Noting the challenges posed by
the exposure to uncertain commodity prices, Directors called for continued prudent policies and
reforms to ensure macroeconomic stability, support diversification, and make growth more
inclusive.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ recent expenditure control and tax collection efforts and
called for continued resolve in the run up to the 2015 elections. They encouraged the authorities
to target a fiscal surplus over the medium term to bolster the external position and help build
buffers. Directors underscored that successful fiscal consolidation will require additional
measures, supported by a rules-based framework, incorporating a fiscal anchor. They encouraged
the authorities to exercise expenditure restraint by phasing out untargeted subsidies, containing
the wage bill, and prioritizing spending on goods and services and capital projects while
protecting the vulnerable. Timely implementation of the VAT, together with further reform and
modernization of the customs and tax structure, will strengthen revenues. Directors also
encouraged the authorities to ensure the sustainability of the newly established national pension
and health care system.

2

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3
Directors considered the monetary policy stance to be appropriate but advised the authorities to
stand ready to tighten monetary policy, if needed, to safeguard external stability. They
encouraged pushing ahead with plans to establish open market operations, which will expand
available monetary policy tools. Directors noted that the fixed exchange rate regime remains an
appropriate anchor for policymaking for now, but requires a substantial fiscal tightening to
support the current level of the currency. They encouraged the authorities to phase out existing
multiple currency practices as soon as possible, and to improve data collection on foreign
currency lending to better inform regulation.
Directors commended the progress in upgrading financial sector resilience. They looked forward
to the implementation of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) recommendations,
focusing on further improvements in prudential standards, supervision, the Anti-Money
Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT regime), and continued efforts to
bolster the institutional capacity and effectiveness of the central bank. Directors supported plans
to establish a credit bureau and deposit insurance, modernize the payment and settlement system,
and strengthen the insurance sector regulatory framework.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ focus on improving competitiveness and diversifying the
economy. They looked forward to the timely passage of the draft legislation spearheaded by the
Competitiveness Unit, which will modernize the business environment. They also saw scope for
increased labor market flexibility, supported by a well-targeted social safety net, to foster job
creation. Directors advised a cautious approach regarding the planned increases in the minimum
wage. Further progress in strengthening the data quality would enable sound policymaking.

Statement by the Surinamese Authorities
October 30, 2014
1.
The Surinamese authorities are thankful to the Executive Board of Directors for their balanced
assessment of the economic and financial developments and outlook of Suriname, and to the Article
IV and the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) teams for the constructive discussions. The
Article IV report, in spite of its unwarranted negative tone, recognizes Suriname’s favorable growth
perspectives despite the challenges posed by lower commodity prices. It also acknowledges the
significant efforts toward fiscal consolidation in 2014, in which the Surinamese authorities are
determined to persevere. The first FSAP assessment is welcomed by the authorities. Its
recommendations will be used as inputs to the ongoing efforts to modernize and strengthen the
financial sector.
Recent macroeconomic developments and outlook
2.
Suriname is one of the fastest growing countries in the Caribbean region and South America.
The economy continues to expand at healthy rates, and the authorities forecast real GDP growth
rates between 4 and 5 percent in the next few years on account of robust domestic investments,
notably in the construction sector, and the large investments in oil and mining that will come onstream in the period 2015-17.
3.
In the oil sector, the start of operations of a new large refinery will all but eliminate oil
derivative imports, improving the current account balance by an estimated 2 percent of GDP from
2015. A new gold mining project – the Merian Gold Project, involving investments of about 20
percent of GDP – will increase gold exports by around 8 percent of GDP starting in 2017. This project
is a partnership between the US-based Newmont Mining Corporation and the Government of
Suriname. While these ongoing projects will have an extraordinary effect on the balance of payments
of Suriname, the staff decided to devote unusually little space to them in the report.
4.
The authorities have embarked on a process of fiscal consolidation in 2014, following the
slippages of 2013. In the first eight months of 2014, the deficit was reduced to 2.9 percent of the
GDP projected for the year1, compared to 4.7 percent of GDP in the same period of 2013. Such
improvement was entirely due to cuts in expenditure, as revenue has stagnated in nominal terms
with the continued fall in fiscal receipts from the gold sector. Measures to enhance revenue have also
been taken – such as increasing the royalty rate on small-scale gold miners, higher taxation on
logging and mining concessions, and sales of government land to lease holders – but will only start
to have an effect in the second half of 2014 due to the usual implementation and collection lags.
Fiscal consolidation is taking place, as recognized by staff, but the report does not acknowledge the
fact that this is happening in a pre-election year and was set in motion before the Article IV mission
arrived in Suriname. More recently, some politically difficult decisions have been made, such as a
gradual phasing out of electricity subsidies, which currently amount to about 2 percent of GDP. With
such decisions, the authorities reaffirm their commitment to take adjustment measures as needed
even in the run-up to the general elections of May 2015.
1

The National Planning Office of Suriname projects real GDP growth at 3.5 percent in 2014.

5.
To correct for the imbalances of 2013 and arrest the decline in international reserves, the
Central Bank increased the reserve requirement ratios on domestic and foreign currency deposits by
5 percentage points in late-2013 and the Central Bank will not hesitate to further tighten monetary
policy if needed. To render monetary policy more agile, the Central Bank is broadening its monetary
policy toolkit, modernizing the domestic payment system, and deepening money and capital markets.
In the coming months, the introduction of open market operations will allow the Central Bank to
better control liquidity.
6.
Suriname is amongst the countries in the Caribbean with the lowest debt to GDP ratio. The
Government’s external liabilities consist mainly of debt to multilateral creditors and official creditors.
Commercial loans are negligible. In this respect, the 25 percent public sector participation in the
Merian Gold Project will be owned and operated by the state-owned energy corporation Staatsolie.
The financial sector: Suriname’s first FSAP
7.
The Surinamese authorities welcome the completion of the first FSAP. It comes after many
years – and much insistence on the part of the Surinamese authorities and their representatives at
the IMF. The authorities wish to express their appreciation to the staff for the significant effort that
was undertaken and the meticulous care with which the FSAP was carried out. The authorities agree
with the thrust of the conclusions, and intend to make the best use of the FSAP as guidance in their
ongoing efforts to modernize and strengthen the financial system.
8.
Prior to the FSAP mission, the Central Bank had embarked on an extensive reform program
which included upgrading bank supervision. Some of the measures already taken were the
introduction of the CAMELS2 approach to risk assessment and the strengthening of the classification
of bank loans and credit risk frameworks. In light of the FSAP, a Central Bank inter-departmental
working group has been created and tasked with amending or refocusing the existing reform
program and with coordinating the implementation of the FSAP’s recommendations. The Central
Bank implemented new capital rules as of July 1, 2014, increasing the capital adequacy ratio from 8
to 10 percent. Moreover, the Bank is preparing to issue financial stability reports regularly, starting in
2015. The Caribbean Financial Action Task Force follow-up reports recognize the significant progress
Suriname has made and is still making in its Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of
Terrorism framework.
Structural issues
9.
The current administration has been committed from the very beginning to social inclusion
and development. In pursuit of this guiding principle, the authorities have recently adopted
legislation on a minimum wage, on national pensions, and a comprehensive health insurance reform.
The adoption of these laws improves sustainable social equality, which has been a hallmark of this
administration’s policy thrust. The authorities have been mindful of the possible fiscal costs of these

2

Where the six letters stand for (C)apital adequacy, (A)sset quality, (M)anagement competence,
(E)arning ability, (L)iquidity risk, and (S)ensitivity to market risk.

reforms. Nevertheless, given the broad-based support these laws have gathered, the authorities are
convinced that reallocations in the budget could create space for any unplanned additional financing
related to these reforms in order to preserve fiscal sustainability.
10.
In light of the historically high dependency of the economy on the mineral sector and of
many episodes of volatility in commodity prices, the diversification of the economy is of high priority.
In this regard, the Vice-President of Suriname, a former chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, has
been tasked with coordinating the enhancement of the business environment. The Competitiveness
Unit Suriname (CUS) was created under the Vice-Presidency to lead this process. Efforts currently
underway focus on modernizing the legal framework for doing business. The Council of Ministers has
recently approved draft laws on competition policy, limited liability companies, and electronic
publication of the registration of new firms. Furthermore, 16 new laws in areas ranging from
protection of intellectual property to access to finance for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
are currently being drafted.
11.
Global Competitiveness and Doing Business reports identify low access to financing as a key
constraint for firms in Suriname. Given the links between access to finance and competiveness, the
CUS elaborated a roadmap which identified three major areas for development. Initiatives in these
three areas are already underway, including training programs for SMEs and support to banks’ own
training programs focused on SMEs. In addition, a law on secured transactions has just been drafted
and will pave the way for the creation of a registry of movable assets. Finally, a draft law for the
establishment of a credit bureau is being finalized.

The Central Bank is spearheading financial education. It carries out several projects in this
area on a regular basis, coordinated by its “Training Institute and Study Center”. Those projects
target four groups: the young, the financial sector, SMEs, and the general public. The Central Bank
has participated this year for the first time in the Global Money Week (GMW), an initiative of the
Child and Youth Finance International Movement (CYFI) aimed at enhancing the financial capabilities
of children and youth. The Bank was nominated for an award and was invited to share its experience
on the CYFI’s high level stakeholder’s forum at the United Nations. Preparations for the 2015 GMW
have commenced. This year, a financial literacy baseline study will be executed, which will result in a
financial education strategic plan. The Central Banks of Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago have
recently signed a memorandum of understanding regarding a “Knowledge Transfer” program aimed
at financial education for SMEs. We encourage staff to focus on this issue in next year’s Article IV
consultation.

Capacity building is a major and ongoing challenge for small states. The authorities highly
appreciate the Fund’s training and technical assistance. Surinamese professionals have gained
enormously from the support the Fund has provided in the field of statistics, monetary policy design,
and others. Further capacity building efforts will be required in order to follow staff’s
recommendations, including those from the FSAP. The Surinamese authorities will seek continued
Fund’s technical support in their development endeavors.
