STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION AND
SECOND REVIEW UNDER THE EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY
ARRANGEMENT AND REQUEST FOR MODIFICATION OF
PERFORMANCE CRITERION

KEY ISSUES
Context: Solomon Islands has achieved considerable gains in development and
macroeconomic stability in recent years. However, the country is at an important
juncture—with both security and development assistance being scaled down by donors,
it needs to become more self-reliant. In addition, new drivers of growth are needed as
the depletion of logging stocks in the coming years will adversely affect growth, exports,
and public finances. Spending pressures and lower growth give rise to fiscal risks.
Outlook and risks: Growth is recovering gradually after slowing in the first half of 2013
because of unfavorable external conditions and various supply shocks, while the external
sector is weakening, in part owing to adverse terms-of-trade developments. Risks are
tilted to the downside and include lower export prices, an oil price shock, and a steeperthan-expected withdrawal of foreign aid. Legislative elections scheduled for 2014
introduce uncertainty over the pace of reform.
Program: Program performance has been broadly satisfactory. All performance criteria
(PCs) for June 2013 and indicative targets (ITs) for June 2013 and September 2013, as
well as continuous PCs, were met. In addition, a critical reform—the Public Finance
Management Act (PFMA)—has been approved by Parliament. However, some structural
benchmarks scheduled for 2013 were missed because of capacity constraints. The
authorities are requesting a modification of the PC on net credit to the government for
end-December 2013 and a re-setting of four program benchmarks.
Key policy recommendations:








Protect policy buffers and fiscal discipline by keeping overall expenditure, including
from the supplementary budget, within the original spending envelope.
Strengthen the quality of public spending by improving the transparency and
accountability of programs, including scholarships and constituency funds.
Strengthen fiscal management by implementing the new PFMA.
Maintain the monetary policy stance, but stand ready to tighten policy if needed.
Follow the basket peg more closely, including by widening the operational band and
re-centering it periodically.
Improve capacity to execute macro-critical reform agenda.
Advance structural reforms to create a more conducive environment for private
sector growth. A sound infrastructure investment program within a comprehensive
growth and poverty reduction strategy would serve the country well.

BACKGROUND AND OUTLOOK
1.

Economic performance weakened in the first half of 2013.



Growth has slowed. In the first half of the year, output of most agricultural commodities
declined owing to unfavorable weather conditions and lower export prices, while gold
production fell due to refurbishment of the gold mine. Logging activity was volatile, but on
average lower than last year.



Inflation accelerated earlier in the year but has stabilized at around 6 percent (year-on-year)
since mid-2013. The increase was driven primarily by domestic food prices while imported
inflation was low on account of tame global commodity prices.



A current account deficit of 2 percent of annual GDP emerged due to adverse terms-of-trade
developments (lower prices of logs and gold) as well as gold mine reconstruction. However,
net international reserves (NIR) held up due to sizeable foreign direct investment (FDI).

2.
The outlook is subdued, while risks are tilted to the downside. Some rebound is under
way in the second half of the year, partly due to the recovery of gold output, which will carry over to
the next year. Real GDP is projected to expand by 2.9 percent for 2013 as a whole and by 4 percent
in 2014—down from 4.9 percent in 2012.1 In the medium term, growth is expected to be moderate
at 3½–4 percent, with gold output increasing marginally and logging production declining due to
stock depletion. In this context, the current account is expected to go down from near balance in
2012 to a deficit of 4.2 percent in 2013 and weaken further going forward. In addition to the factors
mentioned above, the decline is driven by diminishing donor support, return of the gold mine to
profitability, and several investment projects with large import content. The outlook is subject to a
variety of downside external risks (Appendix I), including a slowdown in emerging or advanced
economies leading to lower external demand or prices of exports; an oil price shock; and a sharperthan-expected curtailment of foreign grants. On the other hand, the decline in logging output may

Prior to the mission, the National Statistical Office released a new set of national accounts, which implied downward
revisions to earlier growth estimates in 2011 and 2012 (from 10.7 percent and 4.9 percent to 6.4 percent and 2.6
percent, respectively). This report presents numbers based on the earlier estimates since they formed the basis for
discussions and their use did not have a material impact on the analysis which is largely forward-looking.

not materialize as fast as envisaged. The authorities broadly agreed with the outlook and the
characterization of risks.

PROGRAM PERFORMANCE
3.
Program performance has been satisfactory overall, with all continuous and end-June
2013 PCs met and a key reform accomplished ahead of time, but some reforms experienced
significant delays.


PCs and ITs were met. The June 2013 PCs on net credit to the government (NCG), net domestic
assets of the central bank (NDA), the cash balance of the central government (CBCG), and the
NIR were all met, the first three with large margins; moreover, the indicative targets for these for
September 2013 were also met, as were the IT on health and education spending and the
continuous PCs on external debt. The authorities are on track to meet the end-December PCs,
except for NCG, where lower-than-programmed revenue (reflecting slower growth in early 2013
and the weaker terms-of-trade) is expected to lead to a small drawdown of government
deposits. The authorities have requested a modification of this PC, and staff supports it on
account that it is small and would accommodate automatic stabilizers to lower revenues.



Mixed progress with structural agenda. A key pillar in the design of stronger fiscal institutions, the
Public Finance Management Act (PFMA), was sent to Parliament (October 2013 benchmark) and
approved in October 2013.2 In addition, the instructions for state enterprise borrowing have
been submitted to the Cabinet (June 2013 benchmark) and a new tax exemption regime was
approved (originally a component of the new Customs and Excise Law benchmark). However, a
number of other reforms experienced delays, and thus the related program benchmarks were
not met. These include obtaining the Cabinet’s approval to changes in the tax system to allow
for a mining regime (June 2013 benchmark) and then submitting the changes to Parliament
(November 2013 benchmark); submitting to Parliament a revised National Provident Fund (NPF)
Act (October 2013 benchmark); and the publication of the Auditor General’s audits of 2012
constituency funds (November 2013 benchmark).



Revised reform agenda. The main reason behind the delays in reforms is capacity constraint,
which was recently exacerbated by the heavy workload required to get the PFMA approved. A
key bottleneck is the office in charge of vetting and drafting legislation, the Attorney General’s
Chambers, which is insufficiently staffed in view of the heavy legislative agenda. Staff held
discussions on a revised timetable with all parties involved and additional donor support was
obtained to address the bottleneck. As a result of these discussions, and in view of the
authorities’ commitment to these reforms, staff supports the authorities’ request in the attached
Letter of Intent for revised test dates for the missed structural benchmarks.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Fiscal Policy—Protecting Buffers and Improving Quality of Spending
Background
4.
The under-execution of development spending led to a significant budget surplus. In
the first six months of 2013, compared with the same period in 2012, total revenue fell by
1.2 percentage points of GDP (tax and non-tax revenue fell by 0.4 and 0.8 percent of GDP,
respectively), reflecting the economic slowdown and the adverse terms-of-trade shocks, in particular
a decline in logging output and prices (logging tax revenue fell by 0.3 percent of GDP). In addition,
grants from development partners fell by 0.3 percent of GDP. At the same time, the development
budget was under-executed, in part because of the introduction of a new chart of accounts, which
led to delays in the implementation of development projects. The under-execution of development
programs, together with slower implementation of recurrent budget, more than offset the reduction
in revenues and grants. Consequently, the fiscal balance rose to 5 percent of annual GDP in the first
half of 2013 (compared to a surplus of 4.3 percent in the same period in 2012).
5.
Nonetheless, weak commitment controls and rising spending pressures on selected
programs led to the approval of a supplementary budget in October 2013. In net terms, the
supplementary budget authorizes an unfunded spending increase amounting to over 2 percent of
GDP, a large portion of which is allocated to the education sector, mostly at the tertiary level. A
matter of concern is the fact that the budget ceilings for scholarships were breached by a large
margin and arrears emerged in the payment of scholarships for students, including those studying
abroad. The decentralized system of approving scholarships led to a rapid increase in spending in
this area.
6.
Spending pressures are expected to be very high in the rest of 2013. The authorities
expect development expenditures to recover in the last months of 2013 as the improvements in the
information systems and training on the new chart of accounts begin to materialize. At the same
time, total revenues for 2013 are expected to be

are taken. However, the authorities have

7.
The Cabinet approved a prudent draft budget for 2014. The authorities have indicated
their intent to submit to Parliament a balanced cash budget, or a small surplus when amortization is
excluded. Tax collections are forecast to decline by 0.6 percent of GDP, mostly owing to lower
logging revenue. Recurrent donor support is expected to decline by 1.2 percent of GDP. Both

6

SOLOMON ISLANDS

recurrent and development expenditure are lower as shares of GDP in line with the the projections
for total revenue and grants. Health and education will be the largest components of recurrent
expenditure. The budgeted development expenditure would allow infrastructure maintenance, new
capital expenditure, and ongoing funding of development projects carried over from previous years.
The authorities’ estimates imply a fiscal surplus of about 1 percent of GDP in 2014 under the GFSM
definition. Staff projects somewhat lower donor support, which is expected to lead to a smaller fiscal
surplus in 2014, in the order of 0.3 percent of GDP.
8.
Fiscal reforms are advancing, even though some have experienced delays. The recent
approval of the PFMA by Parliament is an important achievement of the authorities. In addition, the
government has strengthened the tax exemptions regime. However, as noted above, while there has
been progress with other structural reforms, there have also been some significant delays owing to
the priority given to the PFMA as well as capacity constraints. The government is committed to
reducing the burden of public debt guided by the principles established under the Honiara Club
Agreement and the Debt Management Strategy. It will continue reforms aimed at strengthening
the debt management framework.

Staff Views
9.
The Solomon Islands faces a moderate risk of debt distress. The Joint IMF/World Bank
Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) Update indicates that under the baseline scenario all external
public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt will remain below policy-relevant thresholds. However,
the thresholds may be breached in case of shocks to net non-debt-creating flows and financing
terms. This underscores the importance of maintaining fiscal buffers to confine the risk of debt
distress.
10.
Maintaining policy buffers requires a sustained push for fiscal discipline and careful
management of the budget. Unfunded recurrent expenditures in the supplementary budget will
put pressure on the execution of other programs. The overcommitment in spending in the
supplementary budget is largely a result of weak fiscal management, especially the lack of financial
and policy oversight over tertiary education, which threatens to erode confidence in economic
policies. The unfunded expenditures, if not addressed appropriately, would jeopardize program
targets. Staff urged the authorities to reduce the planned level of new spending and other
expenditures in the supplementary budget to fit within the orginal spending envelope agreed in the
program. The mission also encouraged the authorities to commit to a prudent budget in 2014,
consistent with program objectives, while protecting spending on health and primary education.
11.
The quality of public expenditure needs to be safeguarded to make sure priority
spending is not crowded out. The timely implementation of the PFMA is critical for achieveing this
objective, including with the issuance of relevant implementing regulations. In addition, two areas
require particular attention:


Constituency development funds. The authorities should review the merits of channeling an
increasingly large share of public resources through the funds controlled directly by
Parliamentarians. In addition, there is a need to improve transparency and accountability in the
use of these funds. Adequate implementing regulations for the Constituency Development

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

SOLOMON ISLANDS

Funds Act (CDFA) are needed to ensure continued confidence in economic policies, including by
development partners. The audit of 2012 constituency fund spending, which is very advanced,
should be finished and published in a timely manner.


Tertiary scholarships. Significant challenges have emerged with the management of tertiary
scholarships for students both in the country and abroad. Inadequate record keeping and the
approval of scholarships outside established channels have led to the rapid increase in these
expenditures and the emergence of arrears in the payment of university fees and stipends.
Tertiary scholarship expenditures are now crowding out other priority spending, including on
primary education. Staff stressed the need to strengthen the eligibility criteria for tertiary
scholarships, apply international best practices of public finance in this program, and find an
appropriate balance between various levels of education.

12.
The mission urged the authorities to redouble efforts to implement their fiscal reform
agenda in the coming months, before the electoral cycle reduces the reform momentum. Staff
and the authorities discussed ways in which the IMF can support these efforts, including by
providing technical advice on the implementing regulations of the CDFA.

Authorities’ Views
13.
The authorities, who have a track record of fiscal discipline, committed to addressing
fiscal slippages. They said that they will implement the 2013 supplementary budget within the
original spending envelope, by scaling back new spending and reallocating other spending. The
authorities also noted their efforts to strengthen tax compliance, including with the recent addition
of staff to the Internal Revenue Division and the Customs Office. In the 2014 budget, the authorities
stressed that they are targeting a cash balance , and recognized the challenge of achieving the right
balance between recurrent and development expenditures. To this effect, they noted that the budget
will protect spending on primary education and health, which will remain at least at the same level as
in 2013. The authorities also stressed that they will continue to exercise prudence in borrowing, while
tapping concessional loans to finance high-priority development projects.
14.
The authorities are taking steps to improve the transparency and accountability of
constituency funds and tertiary scholarship awards. They are working on the implementing
regulations for the CDFA, in consultation with development partners and other stakeholders, and
expect to put them in place before the end of 2013 (December 2013 benchmark). The authorities
plan to publish the Auditor General’s audit of 2012 constituency fund spending when it is completed
(proposed benchmark for March 2014). The government will seek Cabinet’s approval of revamped
policies for tertiary scholarships (proposed benchmark for end-January 2014), including better
commmitment controls and improved accountability and transparence, so that they can be in place
and effective for the next school year. The authorities will also review education policies, in
consultation with development partners and other stakeholders, including to ensure an adequate
balance of spending between primary and tertiary education (proposed benchmark for March 2014).
15.
The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to fiscal reforms. They noted that getting
approval of the PFMA absorbed a considerable amount of scarce resources and emphasized that
delays in other legislation were due to capacity constraints. The authorities are working with
development partners to alleviate critical bottlenecks and have proposed a well-thought out revised
8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOLOMON ISLANDS

timetable for key legislation. Draft changes to the tax system to allow for a mining regime are
currently being vetted by the Attorney General’s Chambers. The authorities will obtain Cabinet’s
approval of this legislation by end-January 2014 (proposed benchmark) and submit it to Parliament
by end-March 2014 (proposed benchmark). The draft Customs and Excise law is currently being
updated to reflect the recently adopted and strengthened exemptions policy, and will be submitted
to Parliament by end-June 2014 (proposed benchmark). In addition, the PFMA contains fiscal
responsibility provisions that require the publication of a series of new fiscal documents, starting in
2014. As a first step, the authorities will produce a Final Budget Outcome Report by end-April 2014
(proposed benchmark). To improve public debt management, the authorities will submit to Cabinet
the onlending and guarantees instructions by end-February 2014 (proposed benchmark).

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies—Providing a Stable Nominal
Anchor
Background
16.
Bank credit continues to recover after the sluggish pace recorded in the last few years.
The expansion is particularly rapid in loans to households as well as to the retail, wholesale, and
telecommunication sectors. Reflecting stronger credit growth, an increase in outstanding sterilization
bills of the Central Bank of Solomon Island’s (Bokolo bills), and slower growth in deposits, excess
reserves in the banking system have declined from last year’s level but remain substantial.

The Solomon Islands dollar was broadly
stable against the U.S. dollar. The exchange rate
vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar appreciated gradually over
the first nine months of 2013, and then bounced
close to the beginning-of-year parity. Fluctuations
against the Australian dollar were considerably more
pronounced, with the Solomon Islands dollar
appreciating by as much as 15 percent by endAugust and then reversing its course and unwinding
about half of the appreciation by mid-November.

18.
The central bank is gaining experience with the transition to a basket peg. The CBSI
announced a move from a U.S. dollar peg to an invoice-based basket peg in October 2012. The idea
of the peg is to set the bilateral SI$/USD exchange rate in such a way as to maintain the value of the
basket constant. However, in practice, to avoid excessive fluctuations, the bilateral rate is not allowed
to deviate by more than one percent in either direction from a pre-set “base” rate. If following the
basket requires a larger shift against the U.S. dollar, the Solomon Islands dollar remains at the floor
or at the ceiling of the band until the movements in the basket reverse their course or until the base
rate is adjusted, as happened in June 2013. As a result, the range of fluctuations in the bilateral
exchange rate against the U.S. dollar has been small.

Staff Views
19.
Excess liquidity does not appear to be feeding inflationary pressures at the moment,
but credit growth has picked up and the authorities should remain vigilant. The monetary
transmission mechanism remains weak (Appendix II). The stock of outstanding central bank (Bokolo)
bills is less than half of the banks’ free reserves, and a major expansion might be costly. While the
exchange rate peg plays an important anchoring role, the central bank should be open to using all
instruments at its disposal, including the cash reserve requirement, to mop up liquidity and tighten
monetary policy should credit growth become excessive and inflation pick up.
20.
The Solomon Islands dollar appears moderately overvalued. While estimating real
exchange rate norms is inherently challenging, all three CGER methods suggest varying degrees of
overvaluation (Appendix III). This reflects the considerable appreciation of the Solomon Islands dollar
in real terms over the last two years and the projected deterioration in the current account balance
over the medium term. At the same time, a large portion of the current account deficits is expected
to be covered by FDI. An adequate reserve cushion (see Appendix IV) and the expected availability of
near-term financing afford time to correct overvaluation by developing new sources of exports and
by increasing productivity through stronger business environment, better infrastructure, and higher
educational attainment.
21.
The central bank should follow the currency basket more closely by gradually widening
the operational band and re-centering the band to the ceiling or floor periodically. Staff and
the authorities reviewed the operational implementation of the basket peg regime and discussed
ways of improving it. While the narrow band to which the authorities had restricted movements in
the SI$/USD exchange rate has played a useful role while the CBSI gains experience with the new
regime, over time the band should be broadened and adjusted to allow the benefits of a basket peg
(including greater stability vis-à-vis the Australian dollar) to be enjoyed more fully, and to help
economic agents get accustomed to greater variability in the SI$/USD exchange rate.

Authorities Views
22.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff analysis. They highlighted the role of the
currency peg in keeping imported inflation low and noted that high overall inflation was caused
mainly by domestic supply shocks. At the same time, they expressed their concern with inflation
being persistently higher than in most other Pacific Island countries. The authorities emphasized that
Bokolo bills remain their most flexible tool of monetary policy, and they continue to develop this
instrument including by introducing new maturities—which they also view as important for financial
10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOLOMON ISLANDS

market development. At the same time, raising the cash reserve requirement is an option if
monetary conditions need to be tightened sharply. They agreed that the real exchange rate is
stronger than historical averages, which suggests some degree of overvaluation. However, given that
most consumer goods and many inputs into production are imported, the authorities would not
view a weaker currency favorably.

C. Financial Sector—Promoting Financial Stability and Access to Finance
Background
23.
The financial system is sound, although financial depth is limited. Banks are adequately
capitalized, highly liquid, and profitable. After declining for several years, nonperforming loans as a
share of total loans have stayed between 3.5 and 4 percent since end-2012. At the same time, the
ratio of credit to GDP rose to 17 percent by mid-2013, which is still only about half of the average for
Pacific Island countries. Impediments to credit expansion include weak investor protection, an
unclear property rights regime, and a shortage of investable projects. Under pressure from
environmentalists, a foreign bank has announced that it will no longer provide banking services to
logging firms. The authorities are concerned about the impact of that move on the logging industry.
To facilitate the introduction of alternative sources of financing and banking services, Parliament has
approved a law authorizing the central bank to issue interim banking licenses. One such license has
already been granted, but the CBSI has prohibited the applicant from carrying out traditional
banking operations until the full license is given.
24.
Financial sector reforms are advancing. Consultations with stakeholders on a new NPF Act
have been completed, and the law is about to be drafted with the goal of submitting it to Parliament
by June 2014. The CBSI is advancing in the preparation of a new Credit Unions Act (CUA). The
authorities are also working on a revised Financial Institutions Act (FIA) that would promote financial
sector stability and development and have proposed a structural benchmark on Cabinet approval of
drafting instructions for the Act by June 2014.

The authorities should continue pressing ahead with financial sector development. It is
essential to revise the NPF Act promptly in order to strengthen the NPF’s investment regime,
improve its governance, and safeguard retirement savings. Regarding the interim banking license,
CBSI has appropriately limited the new entity’s activities to setting up shop rather than conducting
banking operations until they have completed the due dilligence of the firm. A comprehensive
revision of the FIA will help improve banking sector stability and facilitate its development.

Authorities Views
26.
The authorities highlighted progress made in advancing financial legislation despite
capacity constraints. The direction of changes to the NPF Act has been approved by the Cabinet
and discussed with stakeholders. Delays relative to the program schedule were caused by capacity
constraints in the drafting of legislation, and the authorities have proposed to move the benchmark
on submitting the Act to Parliament to June 2014. Work on the CUA, FIA, and a new payments
system law is ongoing. With respect to the interim banking license, the authorities pointed out that
the period provided by the current law for considering a full license application is insufficient for
reviewing new entities. Hence, the interim license gives the central bank more time to examine the
applicant, while not allowing the firms to carry out banking operations until the review is completed
safeguards financial stability.

Development Goals has been limited in recent years.
28.
In response to these challenges, the government has formulated a wide-ranging
National Development Strategy (NDS) for 2011-20. Launched in 2011 with the overarching focus
on building better lives for all Solomon Islanders, the NDS has eight objectives: alleviating poverty;
supporting the vulnerable; ensuring universal access to quality health care; ensuring universal access
to quality education; increasing economic growth, employment, and incomes; developing physical
infrastructure and utilities; responding to climate change and managing the environment; and
improving governance and order. A 2013 NDS Performance Report indicates that while progress has
been made toward achieving these objectives, it has been uneven across categories and generally
slower than desired. The authorities have submitted the NDS and the 2013 Performance Report to
the IMF Executive Board as an Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP).

SOLOMON ISLANDS

Box 1. Infrastructure Needs in the Solomon Islands
Infrastructure needs are large in Solomon Islands. Given the remoteness of the country and the
dispersion of its population, adequate transportation and communication are indispensable. However,
the main airport struggles to meet International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards, limiting
its commercial viability and the Solomon Islands’ connectivity with the rest of the world. Domestic
aviation uses small, inefficient planes, as larger ones cannot be handled by provincial airstrips. Internal
shipping service relies on a small fleet of 20 to 50 year old ships. Maritime infrastructure is often
damaged or defunct. Roads are in poor condition. Information and communication technology
infrastructure as well as penetration are among the poorest in the region. Electricity provision is
limited, and most rural communities rely on traditional fuels, such as wood. The supply of water and
sanitation are also key challenges, with no access to piped water for 75 percent of rural households. On
top of that, the Solomon Islands would need significant investments to mitigate the risk of natural
disasters and consequences of climate change.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOLOMON ISLANDS

Staff Views
29.
The authorities should focus on key areas of infrastructure development and
diversifying the sources of growth. Particular emphasis should be put on reliable access to power,
telecommunications, and transportation. The key to building much needed infrastructure is stronger
implementation capacity, reliable funding, and clear procedures for determining the use of
communal land. The governance and implementation capacity of the National Transport Fund
should be improved. Resolving the licensing dispute, clarifying land use rights, and establishing a
transparent mineral taxation regime would open the door for the exploitation of Solomon Islands’
massive nickel resources. Infrastructure development would spur tourism, fishing, and
manufacturing. Clearer land use rights and measures to promote financial sector development would
improve access to finance, which is key for private sector development and financial inclusion.
30.
The Solomon Islands would benefit from a well-articulated development plan in the
context of a comprehensive Poverty Reduction Strategy. The objectives stated in the NDS are
well aligned with the country’s needs and aspirations. Achieving these goals requires a detailed
implementation plan. The preparation of a Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) would help channel
efforts towards more inclusive growth.

Authorities Views
31.
The authorities stressed that infrastructure development is a key focus area for them. A
comprehensive Medium-Term Development Plan is being formulated. Several major projects are
under consideration. An alternative route for the underwater cable is being sought to overcome the
delay. After the review, steps will be taken to improve the operation of the NTF. The authorities
viewed broad development as key for poverty reduction since poverty is widespread and reflects
mostly the generally low level of income in the country rather than problems specific to certain
population groups. Nonetheless, they expressed concern about the effort needed to produce a PRS,
given capacity constraints, and suggested that, to address poverty, the PRS would largely be built on
existing inputs, such as the National Development Strategy, Medium-Term Development Plan, and
the Household Income and Expenditure Survey.

OTHER PROGRAM ISSUES
32.
Disbursements from most development partners depend on the satisfactory
implementation of the IMF-supported program. Large donor financing is expected from:
(i) Australia and New Zealand—about US$45 million in budget support for health and education in
2013; (ii) the Asian Development Bank—more than US$38 million is projected during 2013–16 to
finance infrastructure projects in transportation and information and communication technology, in
the form of budget support, project grants and concessional loans;4 (iii) the World Bank—
US$2 million Development Policy Grant is in the pipeline for 2013; and (iv) the European Union—
US$1¾ million in budget support is expected to be disbursed in 2013.
4

Of this US$38 million, US$18 million—US$7½ million in grants and US$10½ million in loans—is expected to be
disbursed once discussions on the undersea fiber optic cable are finalized, and US$5 million in budget support was
disbursed in 2013 under the Economic and Financial Reform Program.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

SOLOMON ISLANDS

33.
The main risks to the ECF-supported program are political and limited institutional
capacity. The political situation remains fluid. Looking ahead, pressures on the budget may increase,
in particular in the run-up to the parliamentary elections due in the second half of 2014. While
political instability could undermine program ownership, the track record so far suggests that
ownership is durable and cuts across party lines. Progress in strengthening public institutions
continues. Nonetheless, capacity constraints remain a formidable challenge, which may be
exacerbated by the phased reduction in foreign assistance. Technical assistance by the Fund and
other development partners is aimed at mitigating capacity constraints.
34.
Progress under the program will continue to be monitored through performance
criteria, indicative targets, structural benchmarks, and other necessary measures in order to
complete semi-annual program reviews. Quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets
for December 2013, March 2014, and June 2014 are set out in Table 1 and structural benchmarks are
set out in Table 2 of the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies. They are guided by the
Technical Memorandum of Understanding. The third and fourth reviews are expected to take place
on or after June 15, 2014 and November 15, 2014, respectively. The authorities highlighted their
commitment to keeping the reform momentum going, even in the forthcoming period ahead of
elections scheduled for 2014, while they recognized the challenges posed by the ambitious agenda
for the next six months.

STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
After slowing early in 2013, economic growth is recovering. Adverse terms-of-trade and
weather shocks, as well as the temporary fall in gold production, led to a slowdown in activity,
acceleration in inflation, and deterioration in the current account balance. Conditions improved in
the second half of 2013, and a return of gold production to capacity contributed to a rebound, which
is expected to continue into 2014. The risks to the outlook are mainly external and are biased to the
downside.
36.
The Solomon Islands faces significant long-term growth and development challenges.
Addressing them requires a comprehensive strategy involving both the public and the private sector.
With logging activity expected to decline and gold output likely close to capacity, developing new
sources of growth is critical. This is likely to entail significant infrastructure investment and creating
conditions conducive to private sector growth, including a transparent tax regime, clear land use
rights, and better access to finance. The authorities’ I-PRSP identifies main developmental challenges
and sets out broad strategic objectives. In the next step, a focused poverty reduction strategy could
provide a roadmap towards achieving those objectives, and help channel scarce human and financial
resources to enhancing inclusive growth.
37.
Decisive actions are needed to protect fiscal discipline and improve the quality of
public spending. Lower revenues and unfunded spending in the supplementary budget have
increased fiscal risks. There is a need for timely actions to prioritize spending and to improve the use
of public resources, in particular with constitutency development funds and tertiary education
scholarships. An adequate balance should be sought between spending on primary and tertiary
education.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOLOMON ISLANDS

38.
The authorities should sustain their efforts to implement reforms to build sound fiscal
institutions. The approval of the PFMA constitutes a milestone in the modernization of public
financial management in Solomon Islands—the challenge now will be its implementation. Other
important ongoing reforms include revising the Customs and Excise law to promote fiscal
transparency and enhance the efficiency of revenue collections; implementing a new resource
taxation regime to broaden the tax base and increase revenue transparency; and strengthening
public debt management. The next few months are critical for the success of these reforms, as the
parliamentary elections in the second half of 2014 may slow down the reform momentum.
39.
The stance of monetary policy is appropriate, but the authorities should remain
vigilant. While inflation is high relative to the rest of the region, it has been on a downward trend,
and recent fluctuations appear to be driven by supply shocks. However, in case of a further
acceleration in credit growth and a sustained increase in inflationary pressures, the Central Bank of
Solomon Islands should stand ready to tighten monetary policy using all instruments at its disposal.
40.
The currency basket should be followed more closely. The basket peg is an appropriate
exchange rate regime for Solomon Islands. To benefit from its advantages more fully, the range in
which the bilateral exchange rate of the Solomon Islands dollar against the U.S. dollar is allowed to
move should be widened over time and the center of the band adjusted when either the ceiling or
floor is reached for a sustained amount of time.
41.
The Solomon Islands dollar appears moderately overvalued. While donor financing and
FDI are expected to cover projected current account deficits and ample international reserves afford
a cushion, new sources of exports and faster productivity growth are key to realigning the exchange
rate with fundamentals over time. Maintaining the currency peg and keeping inflation under control
should limit further real appreciation.
42.
The financial system is sound, but efforts to strengthen supervisory and regulatory
frameworks should continue. Planned revisions to the NPF Act, the Financial Institutions Act, and
the Credit Unions Act will contribute to enhancing financial stability and financial inclusion.
43.
Based on the Solomon Islands’ overall satisfactory program performance, staff
recommends the completion of the second review under the ECF-supported program. All
performance criteria for June 2013 have been met. While there have been some delays in the
structural reform agenda because of capacity constraints, the authorities deserve credit for the
progress they have achieved, most importantly with the PFMA. With measures in place to address
critical reform bottlenecks, a timetable to put the reform effort back on track, and a high-level
commitment to ensure adherence to the program, staff supports the authorities’ request for new
test dates for several structural benchmarks, the introduction of additional benchmarks, and the
modification of the PC on net credit to the government.
44.

It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on a 24-month cycle.

Appendix II. Determinants of Inflation in Solomon Islands1
Consumer price inflation in Solomon Islands is among the highest in the region. The monetary
transmission mechanism is weak, while global commodity prices, exchange rate movements, and
domestic economic activity have expected impact on inflation. Supply shocks play a big role, but likely
affect inflation volatility more than its trend. Large international presence in Honiara in recent years
may have contributed to elevated levels of inflation.
Consumer price inflation in the Solomon Islands has been on a broad downward trend over
the last two decades. Still, it remains high relative to the rest of the region and fairly volatile. The
prices of both domestically-produced and imported goods have contributed to volatility.

Regression results show that external shocks and domestic activity have expected impact on
inflation (Table 1). With a pegged exchange rate and few price controls, shocks to international
commodity prices pass through into domestic prices quickly and nearly fully. For example, global oil
prices affect Honiara fuel prices with a short lag and almost one-for-one. The link with international
food prices is somewhat less tight. Depreciation of the Solomon Islands dollar against the Australian
dollar raises the prices of goods imported from

standard error of the coefficient.2 Interestingly, inflation does not appear to be very inertial in
Solomon Islands, with coefficient on the lagged dependent variable fairly low and statistically
insignificant. In line with economic theory, higher level of domestic economic activity relative to
capacity—as measured by the output gap—leads to an acceleration in inflation.3 On the other hand,
regional economic activity—proxied by the average of real GDP growth rates in Australia, New
Zealand and Emerging Asia—does not have a discernible effect on inflation in Solomon Islands.

The link between inflation and monetary aggregates is tenuous. Private sector credit and broad
money do appear to have a statistically significant impact on inflation or its domestic component in
certain specifications (e.g., Table 2), but the results are not very robust.4 This suggests a weakness in
the monetary transmission mechanism noted in earlier work for the Solomon Islands5 and for other
Pacific Island Countries6 as well as low-income countries more generally.7 Liquidity, measured as
excess reserves in the banking system, does not appear to have a direct impact on inflation. On the

The impact of the U.S. dollar exchange rate is partially absorbed in the coefficients on global oil and food prices,
because those prices are converted into Solomon Islands dollars before entering the regression.
3

Solomon Islands has only annual national accounts data, and quarterly GDP series was generated by interpolation.
The output gap was obtained via the HP filter. Given that this activity indicator is not measured directly but rather
derived using statistical techniques, one should view the results involving that variable with a bit of caution.

Monetary data are only available on a consistent basis since 2002, resulting in a shorter sample for these
regressions.

one hand, this suggests that the currently high level of liquidity does not present an immediate
inflationary threat. On the other hand, the weakness of the monetary transmission mechanism
makes it difficult for the central bank to control inflation and to bring it further down.

Supply shocks have a considerable impact on inflation. The fit of the regressions—indicated by
the R-squared—is fairly low, suggesting that some important drivers of inflation are not captured by
the model. In particular, supply shocks likely play a big role in a small, remote, spread-out,
undiversified economy such as that of Solomon Islands, with food items constituting a large share of
the consumer basket. Lately domestic inflation has been running considerably higher than imported
inflation, and the authorities attribute the pick-up in domestic inflation largely to supply disruptions,
primarily weather-related.
Other factors may be at work as well. While supply shocks surely contribute to volatility, given
their transient nature they can hardly account for the persistently elevated level of inflation in the
Solomon Islands relative to the rest of the region. It is possible that the large flow of foreign
assistance and significant expatriate presence since the end of the “tensions” have been driving up
the prices by bringing an influx of purchasing power that the central bank finds difficult to sterilize.
The impact of this phenomenon on measured inflation would be exacerbated by the fact that the
Solomon Islands consumer price index only covers the capital city of Honiara, which is home to just
12.5 percent of the country’s population, but that is where the expatriate community is
concentrated. Ongoing cross-country research on the determinants of inflation in Pacific Island
countries will likely shed further light on the issue.

Appendix III. Solomon Islands: Exchange Rate Assessment
Long-term averages and model-based estimates suggest that the Solomon Islands dollar has become
moderately overvalued since the time of the last assessment.
Recent developments in the real effective exchange rate (REER) point to overvaluation. At the
time of the last Article IV consultation in 2011, the Solomon Islands’ exchange rate was judged as
broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals. After that assessment, the REER appreciated by 23
percent between June 2011 and July 2013. It is now 24 percent above its 20-year average and 27
percent above its 10-year average. The appreciation reflects the Solomon Islands dollar real
appreciation vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar of around 13 percent and the U.S. dollar appreciation of around
10 percent in real terms against the other currencies in the REER basket.

The Macroeconomic Balance (MB) approach shows an overvaluation of 5 percent, suggesting
that the real effective exchange rate needs to depreciate by this much to bring the underlying
current account (CA) to the equilibrium. The MB model constructs the equilibrium current
account (CA norm) as a function of oil balance, aid inflows, initial net foreign asset position (NFA),
and relative2 values for the fiscal balance, old age dependency, population and output growth, and
income. Misalignment is defined as the change in the REER that is needed to bring the underlying
CA in the medium term3 to the equilibrium level, using a country-specific elasticity. The equilibrium
CA deficit over the medium term is estimated at 9 percent of GDP, while the projected medium-term
CA deficit is about 10 percent4. Export and import elasticities of 0.71 and 0.92 are taken from Isard
and Faruquee (1998)5 and translate to a

The Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate (ERER)
approach indicates an overvaluation of 20
percent. It models the ERER as a function of
relative productivity, government consumption,
terms of trade, and remittances. Misalignment is
defined as the difference between the medium
term estimate of ERER and the most recently
observed value of the REER. Estimated
overvaluation reflects the recent REER
appreciation.

The External Sustainability (ES) approach results in an overvaluation of 19½ percent,
indicating that some REER depreciation would be necessary to sustain the current level of

particular benchmark level, given real growth and U.S. inflation rate assumptions. Misalignment is
derived similarly to the MB approach. The results hinge on the assumption on the steady state level
of NFA. As a benchmark, we take the NFA in 2011 of 94 percent of GDP as reported by the IFS.
While admittedly at a high level, the NFA position reflects net FDI liabilities of 96 percent of GDP
due to the Gold Ridge mine. The steady state level could even be higher, as the mining industry
develops and attracts further FDI inflows over the medium term. However, the prospects are
uncertain at this point. Sensitivity tests suggest that a higher level of the steady state NFA position
would imply a lower degree of overvaluation (Table 2).

Appendix IV. Solomon Islands: Assessing Reserve Adequacy
Cross-country comparisons and both traditional and new metrics of reserve adequacy suggest that the
net international reserves (NIR) held by the Central Bank of Solomon Islands (CBSI) are fully adequate
in the current volatile global environment. However, the current level of reserves may decline as the
government draws down the cash balances at the CBSI accumulated from previous grant
disbursements and uses them for earmarked capital projects, which tend to have high import content.
International reserves are an important source of self-insurance against external shocks.
Solomon Islands is vulnerable to a variety of exogenous shocks, such as sharp swings in terms of
trade, given the weakly diversified exports, reliance on international trade to import large quantities
of essential goods, and a fixed exchange rate.
The Solomon Islands accumulated impressive
reserve buffers over the past five years. The NIR
increased more than five times, reaching USD 495
million (7.4 months of prospective imports) at the
end of September 2013 (Figure 1). The current USD
levels are well over the USD 90 million low at the
end of 2008.

Traditional rules of thumb suggest that the Solomon Islands’ reserve position is more than
adequate. Traditional metrics include: (i) import cover, which measures the number of months of
imports that could be sustained should all inflows stop; and (ii) percentage of broad money (M2),
intended to capture the risk of capital flight, when capital account crisis is accompanied by outflows
of deposits of domestic residents.1 On both measures, Solomon Islands is above the traditional rules
of thumb: 3 months of imports and 20 percent of M2 (Figure 2). The reserve cover is also above the
traditional indicators for the other PICs. However, these traditional measures are too simple to
capture the diversity of shocks and vulnerabilities that Solomon Islands faces.

1

While the exact number is not available, the ratio of reserves to short-term external debt by remaining maturity is
several hundred percent, thus exceeding the third traditional benchmark of 100 percent by a very wide margin.

Recently, Dabla-Norris et al. (2011)2 and IMF (2011)3 proposed a new methodology to assess
reserve adequacy in a way specific to low-income countries. In this framework, a crisis is defined
as a sharp drop in absorption, and the optimal level of reserves is determined when the crisis
prevention and mitigation benefits of reserves are balanced against the net financial cost of
reserves. An important feature of the model is that optimal reserve holdings depend on the country
characteristics and policy fundamentals. However, the methodology is particularly sensitive to the
assumption on the opportunity cost of reserves, which ranges between two and six percent. The
opportunity cost of holding reserves proxies for the cost of foregone investment opportunities. It is
based on existing estimates of the marginal product of capital and the differential between
domestic and foreign real interest rates.
The model is calibrated for the Solomon Islands as

country specific distribution over the past sixteen years
(1997-2012). The model then estimates a range of
optimal reserves for the given policy and shock specification. Two alternative policy scenarios are
also considered, subject to the same shocks. In one alternative scenario, optimal reserves are
estimated under less favorable fiscal projections, assuming the 2013 supplementary budget is fully
implemented without offsets, leading to a 3.4 percent deficit. The second scenario gauges the

reserve cover for fragile states with fixed exchange rate regimes.
While adequate at their current levels, reserves may decline as the government draws down
cash balances at the CBSI. Some of these balances were accumulated from previous grant
disbursements earmarked for capital projects, and certain donors insist on government executing
those allocations before new disbursements are made. Given the high import content of capital
projects, their implementation will have a negative impact on the current account and on
international reserves.

Appendix VI. Letter of Intent
December 16, 2013
Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Ms. Lagarde:
The successful implementation of sound economic programs supported by the IMF has helped
consolidate macroeconomic and financial stability in Solomon Islands and facilitated donor support.
Strengthened fundamentals helped the economy deal with a variety of adverse shocks in the first half
of 2013, including a significant terms-of-trade deterioration and poor weather conditions. Despite the
unfavorable environment, growth has continued, albeit at a slower pace than anticipated earlier; net
international reserves rose to US$495 million in September from US$480 million at the end of 2012;
and public debt remains low. We expect new investments to drive robust growth going forward even
though agricultural commodity prices remain subdued, our logging industry is entering a period of
secular decline, and donor aid is expected to fall in the coming years.
Our overall performance under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement has been satisfactory.
We met all of the June 2013 performance criteria (PCs), indicative targets, and continuous PCs. The
PCs on net credit to the government, net domestic assets of the central bank, and the cash balance of
the central government were all met with large margins.
In addition, a critical reform—the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA)—was approved by
Parliament in September, ahead of schedule. However, while there has been progress with other
structural reforms, there have also been delays in the completion, owing to the priority given to the
PFMA as well as capacity constraints. In particular, delays were experienced in the submission to
Parliament of (i) the changes to the tax system to allow for a mining regime (November 2013
benchmark);1 (ii) the revised National Provident Fund (NPF) Act (October 2013 benchmark); and (iii)
the new Customs and Excise Law (November 2013 benchmark. The publication of the Office of Auditor
General’s (OAG) report on 2012 constituency funds (November 2013 benchmark) has also been
delayed. We are fully committed to carrying out these reforms. Moreover, upon a careful examination
of the requirements of these reforms, we are proposing a revised schedule to complete them and
have secured additional resources from the development partners to address the bottlenecks in the
drafting and vetting of legislation that contributed to these delays. In particular, we are requesting
that the test dates for obtaining Cabinet’s approval of changes to the tax system to allow for a mining
regime and submitting then to Parliament be modified to end-January 2014 and end-March 2014,
respectively; that the submission to Parliament of a revised NPF Act and of a new Customs and Excise

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOLOMON ISLANDS

Law be moved to end-June 2014; and that the publication of the OAG report on constituency
development funds be moved to end March 2014.
This year, our fiscal position has been challenged by a rapid increase in tertiary scholarships and
constituency development funds, combined with the impact of unfavorable economic developments
on the revenue. The government is committed to maintaining fiscal discipline and improving the
quality of public spending. To this effect, we intend to implement the supplementary budget
approved in October within the spending envelope for 2013 agreed during the first review of the ECF,
and we will target a balanced budget position in 2013 and 2014. However, our fiscal surplus this year
is likely to be lower than envisaged earlier because revenues have been affected by unfavorable
external conditions. In view of that, we request a small modification of the PC on net credit to the
government because we may need to draw down our deposits to finance the amortization of external
debt.
In addition, to improve the quality of spending, we will revamp policies for tertiary scholarship,
including by strengthening commitment controls and ensuring enhanced transparency (proposed
January 2014 benchmark). Moreover, in consultation with the Core Economic Working Group, we will
review policies on education, and ensure an adequate balance of spending between primary and
tertiary education (proposed March 2014 benchmark).
We are also working on reforms to improve the quality of spending. In particular, we are going to
issue implementing regulations to strengthen the accountability and transparency of constituency
development funds (end-December 2013 program benchmark) and of tertiary scholarships (proposed
program benchmarks for end-January 2014 and end-March 2014). In addition, in consultation with the
Fund, we have designed a strategy to implement financial instructions for the PFMA, including
proposed program benchmarks for budget reports (end-April 2014) and public debt management
(end-February 2014).
We are continuing with our reforms of the financial sector. Substantial progress is being achieved in
the preparation of the Credit Unions Act, and we are on track to meet related program benchmarks
next year. In order to promote financial sector stability and development, we are working on a revised
Financial Institutions Act and will seek Cabinet’s approval of drafting instructions for the Act (proposed
program benchmark for end-June 2014). Our work on a new National Provident Fund Act has fallen
somewhat behind schedule, and we request moving the benchmark on submitting the Act to
Parliament to June 2014.
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP), which supplements the
previous one dated June 10, 2013, provides an update on achievements under our program so far, and
sets out our PCs, indicative targets and structural benchmarks through June 2014. We believe that the
policies set forth in the MEFP are adequate to achieve the objectives of our program. However, if
necessary, we stand ready to take further measures, in consultation with the IMF. We will consult with
the Fund on the adoption of these measures, and in advance of revisions to the policies contained in
the MEFP, in accordance with the Fund's policies on such consultation. Furthermore, we will provide
the Fund with any information it may request on policy implementation, as necessary, to achieve

Attachment I. Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
1.
Economic performance weakened somewhat in the first half of 2013. Growth slowed as
the output of most agricultural commodities and logging declined owing to unfavorable weather
conditions and lower export prices, while gold production temporarily fell as the gold mine was being
refurbished. Inflation accelerated earlier in the year, driven by domestic food prices, but stabilized at
around 6 percent in mid-2013 (year-on-year). The current account deteriorated due to adverse termsof-trade developments as well as gold mine reconstruction, which temporarily reduced exports while
pushing up imports. However, net international reserves increased slightly owing to higher foreign
direct investment.
2.
Macroeconomic Outlook and Risks. The economy, in particular agriculture and gold
production, has begun to rebound in recent months, which is expected to continue in 2014. Real GDP
is projected to expand by about 3 percent for 2013 as a whole and further by 4 percent in 2014. Gold
output is expected to remain close to capacity, but logging production is projected to fall due to the
gradual depletion of stocks. In the medium term, annual growth is expected to be around 3.5 percent.
Boosting growth will require raising investment in infrastructure, fisheries, agriculture and mining. The
outlook is subject to a variety of downside external risks, including lower external demand or prices of
exports, an oil price shock, and a sharper-than-expected curtailment of foreign grants. On the upside,
the expected decline in logging output may not materialize as fast as envisaged.
3.
Program Performance. Program performance has been broadly satisfactory. All performance
criteria (PCs) and indicative targets for end-June, as well as continuous PCs, were met. In addition, a
critical reform—the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA)—was approved by Parliament in
September, ahead of schedule. However, while there has been progress with other structural reforms,
there have also been some significant delays owing to the priority given to the PFMA as well as
capacity constraints, including in the Attorney General’s Chambers, combined with the departure of
selected external advisors. In particular, delays were experienced in the submission to Parliament of (i)
the changes to the tax system to allow for a mining regime (November 2013 benchmark);1 (ii) the
revised National Provident Fund Act (October 2013 benchmark); and (iii) the new Customs and Excise
Law (November 2013 benchmark). The publication of the Office of Auditor General’s (OAG) report on
2012 constituency funds (November 2013 benchmark) has also been delayed. Upon a careful
examination of the requirements for these reforms, we are proposing a revised schedule to complete
them and have secured additional resources from the development partners to address the
bottlenecks in the drafting and vetting of legislation that contributed to these delays. The government
remains firmly committed to these reforms and will complete them in the timeframe described below.

Program Policies
4.
Our policies aim at preserving macroeconomic and financial stability through prudent
policies and building stronger institutions, while carrying out reforms to improve the economy’s
resilience to shocks and to promote sustainable and inclusive growth.

A. Fiscal Policy
5.
We are committed to maintaining fiscal discipline and policy buffers, while providing
resources for critical development spending. The fiscal position remained strong during the first
half of 2013, with the overall fiscal surplus up to 5 percent of GDP (from 4.3 percent in the first half of
2012) due to the under-execution of spending (in particular, development spending). However, since
then, significant fiscal challenges have emerged that pose risks to our fiscal objectives. These
challenges as well as our policies to deal with them include:


Supplementary budget. Unavoidable spending, including clearing of arrears on tertiary scholarships
and other expenditures, led to the approval of a supplementary budget in September 2013, with
an unfunded net increase of spending amounting to over 2 percent of GDP. We will implement the
priorities contained in the supplementary budget within the spending envelop approved during
the first review of the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement in June 2013, by reducing the
level of new spending and reallocating other spending. We believe that this is feasible because of
the lower-than-anticipated spending level in the first half of the year and the expanded fiscal
space approved at the time of first review of the ECF arrangement, even if the latter was intended
for development spending.



Revenue performance. Unfavorable terms of trade and slower economic growth have adversely
impacted government revenues, which are projected to be lower by around 0.5 percent of GDP in
2013 as a whole, compared to first review projections. Lower revenues are projected because of
lower growth, as well as on excises on tobacco and alcohol. We are strengthening tax compliance,
including with the recent incorporation of additional staff to the Internal Revenue Division and the
Customs Office. In addition, nontax revenues, including fishing licenses, are below earlier
projections.



Development spending. The development budget was under-executed, in part because of lower
capital expenditures, which were adversely affected by capacity constraints and transitional
challenges related to the introduction of a new chart of accounts. We have made significant effort
to train staff and expect these expenditures to gradually increase in line with absorptive capacity
and within the overall spending envelope of our financial program.



Constituency development funds. After increasing rapidly in the last few years, the growth of these
expenditures, managed by Members of Parliament, slowed somewhat in the first nine months of
2013. Cabinet has created a committee chaired by the Minister of Finance to prepare the
implementing regulations of the Constituency Development Funds Act, which are expected to be
put in place before end-year (December 2013 benchmark). The regulations are expected to
provide guidance on consultations with various stakeholders—especially constituency members—
on plans for use of funds, linking them to the National and Provincial Development Plans, and will
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

45

SOLOMON ISLANDS

introduce norms for developing costing of projects, managing fund accounts, procurement, and
reporting on use of funds. The OAG’s audit of 2012 constituency fund spending has advanced with
some delays, and the review of 38 out of 50 constituencies has been completed, with the
remaining audits to be completed by the end of the year. We expect the summary findings to be
published by end-2013 and the audits of each constituency by end-March 2014, after each
Member of Parliament has had a chance to react to the findings of the audits. Consequently, we
request that the structural benchmark for the publication of the audit be extended from
November 2013 to end-March 2014.


Tertiary scholarships. Significant challenges have emerged with the management of tertiary
scholarships for students both in the Solomon Islands and abroad. Inadequate record keeping and
the approval of scholarships outside established channels have led to the rapid increase in these
expenditures and the emergence of arrears in the payment of university fees and stipends,
including for students abroad. Tertiary scholarship expenditures are now crowding out other
priority spending, including on primary education. The government is committed to correcting this
situation and has created a committee chaired by the Ministry of Education to revamp the
practices and policies related to tertiary scholarships. We propose to strengthen our policies in a
number of ways, including:


We will seek Cabinet’s approval of a decision to revamp the policies for tertiary scholarships
(proposed benchmark for end-January 2014), in place and effective for the next school year, in
order to ensure that best practices in public finance are applied to this priority program of the
government. Some of the criteria to be included in the Cabinet decision are spelled out in the
attached TMU. A joint group of officials from the Ministry of Finance and
Treasury (MOFT) and Ministry of Education will be specifically assigned to the Ministry of
Education to regularly monitor and report on the Ministry of Education’s administration of
scholarships. The group will advise on the business processes and information required to
enable the government’s financial management information system (FMIS) to better capture
accurate and timely information. This should lead to better commitment control, prevent
arrears in payments to students and universities, and maintain documentation of student
applications in the FMIS.



In coordination with the development partners, the government will review the policies on
tertiary education, including selection criteria, budget allocation, and accountability and
transparency in the use of funds, and make the necessary changes to ensure that an adequate
balance of spending between primary and tertiary education is achieved (proposed benchmark
for end-March 2014) and that spending in this area follows international best practices on
public financial management.

6.
The approval of the Public Finance Management Act constitutes an important
benchmark in the modernization of public financial management in the Solomon Islands. The
law contains many of the elements of a modern PFM law, including sound principles on fiscal
responsibility, and transparency and accountability in the use of public funds. Going forward, initially
we will work on revising and updating the financial instructions in order to effect the policy and
operational intentions of the new PFMA in the areas of budget preparation, expenditure control,
accounting, and financial reporting. This will also include updating the financial instructions to clarify
46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOLOMON ISLANDS

the role of the Internal Audit Office in the implementation of OAG recommendations by the
government’s ministries and agencies, and its technical supporting role to the Audit Committee under
the new Act. We are also working, in collaboration with PIFTAC, on a strategy for the implementation
of the new PFMA. These will entail the accomplishment of key milestones of our PFM reform program
such as:
(i)
strengthening the FMIS in its inter-operability with other financial application
programs in the MOFT and the supporting business processes;
(ii)

implementing new procurement rules and requirements at operational level;

(iii)
embedding the new Chart of Accounts as the structure for recording financial
information and to build standard reporting templates to meet PFMA requirements;
(iv)
updating the accounting framework and financial policies. This will entail the
development of a new set of financial regulations that will consolidate all the rules, processes
and information that will be required (as binding regulations) in the administration of the new
PFMA, including special funds, targeted balances, budget strategy, procurement, public debt
management, public stores, public accounts, public funds, gifts and donations.
(v)

developing and implementing a training and capacity building strategy;

(vi)
entrenching PFM-driven changes as an integral part of the Solomon Islands
Government’s wider public sector and governance reform agenda.
In addition, the PFMA contains fiscal responsibility provisions that require the publication of a
series of new fiscal documents, starting in 2014, which will greatly increase fiscal openness,
transparency and planning. In this context, we will produce a Final Budget Outcome Report (proposed
benchmark by end April 2014); a Mid-Year Budget Review (by end July 2014); the Budget Strategy
Paper (by end July 2014); Fiscal and Debt Management Strategies (by end September 2014); and the
Medium Term Development Plan (by end September 2014).
7.
Public Debt Management. We will continue to exercise prudence in resuming concessional
borrowing to preserve domestic and external stability, while tapping resources to finance high-priority
development projects. The Debt Management Strategy (DMS) provides the framework to anchor our
borrowing plans going forward. We have identified the outstanding debt of state owned enterprises
(SOEs) and submitted to Cabinet instructions for SOE borrowing (June 2013 benchmark). We are
developing the framework for the evaluation, provision, and setting of terms for onlending and
guarantees that are sought from government. We will submit the onlending and guarantees
instructions to Cabinet by end-February 2014 (proposed benchmark) and conduct the final review of
the Honiara Club Agreement. In accordance with the DMS, the 2014 budget will set a limit on new
borrowing based on the debt sustainability analysis of the Debt Management Unit. The debt limit will
be revised on a yearly basis depending on the debt outlook and our investment needs and will cover
all external government borrowing, external and domestic SOE borrowing, and government
guarantees. The Debt Management Advisory Committee (DMAC) will assess all borrowing and
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

47

SOLOMON ISLANDS

guarantees proposals to make sure that projects increase government revenue and GDP, or fund
essential infrastructure that can benefit all citizens.
8.
Other fiscal reforms. Notwithstanding some delays, progress has been achieved with other
reforms, including changes to the tax system to allow for a mining regime (June 2013 and November
2013 benchmarks) and the new Customs and Excise Law (November 2013 benchmark). Regarding the
former, the draft legislation is currently being vetted by the Attorney General’s Chambers and will be
sent to Parliament by end-March 2014. We therefore request that the test dates for obtaining
Cabinet’s approval of changes to the tax system to allow for a mining regime and submitting then to
Parliament be modified to end-January 2014 and end-March 2014, respectively. Regarding the draft
Customs and Excise law, including the exemptions regime, we have recently adopted and
strengthened exemptions policy that includes the establishment of a revenue and customs committee
to review requests for exemptions and make recommendations to the Minister of Finance, who cannot
overrule these recommendations. In addition, all exemptions will be published semiannually. The new
Customs and Excise Law is currently being updated to reflect this policy, and will be submitted to
Parliament by end-June 2014. We therefore request that the test date for this reform be modified to
end-June 2014.
9.
We are preparing the 2014 budget proposal for Parliament. While we are still at the early
stages of the process, we commit to maintaining a prudent budget consistent with the program
objectives. In particular, we will target an overall balanced budget position, with an adequate balance
between recurrent and development expenditures. In addition, we will protect spending on primary
education and health, and commit to maintaining at least the same level as in 2013.

B. Monetary Policy and Exchange Rate Polices
10.
Strengthening monetary and exchange rate policy management. Monetary and exchange
rate policies will continue to be geared to maintaining price and external stability. The Central Bank of
Solomon Islands (CBSI) will continue to strengthen monetary instruments, including by deepening the
market for Bokolo bills through the issuance of additional maturities, and stands ready to take any
actions needed to mop up liquidity if inflationary pressures rise. To this effect, the central bank will
review all its monetary policy instruments, including the cash reserve requirement. The CBSI will adjust
the formula used to implement the exchange rate peg to a basket of currencies, with the aim of
following the basket peg more closely. The CBSI will review the merits of widening the current band of
±1 percent around the base parity of the bilateral SI$/US$ exchange rate, to benefit more fully from
the advantages of a basket peg. To make sure that the currency peg does not lead to real exchange
rate misalignment in the presence of inflation differentials with our trading partners, we will take
further steps to boost productivity growth as described in Section C.
11.
Strengthening the financial supervisory and regulatory frameworks and improving
access to financial services. Despite some temporary delays, progress continues with the preparation
of the revised National Provident Fund legislation aimed at improving its governance and investment
framework. We are currently incorporating comments received from the recently concluded
consultation phase, and expect to begin the drafting of the legislation shortly. Upon the approval of

48

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOLOMON ISLANDS

Cabinet, we plan to submit the draft legislation to Parliament before end-June 2014 (proposed
program benchmark). Progress is also being made in the preparation of the Credit Unions Act (CUA),
which aims at establishing a sound regulatory and supervisory framework under the management of
the central bank. We will submit to Cabinet the draft CUA by end-March 2014 (program benchmark)
and to Parliament by end-June 2014 (program benchmark). The central bank will also continue with
the preparations of a new payment system law, with support from development partners. Finally, we
are preparing a new Financial Institutions Act, in line with IMF technical assistance recommendations,
and intend to obtain Cabinet’s approval of drafting instructions by end-June 2014 (proposed program
benchmark). We remain committed to maintaining financial stability, including by conducting full due
diligence before any institution can commence banking operations in the Solomon Islands.

C. Policies to Promote Inclusive Growth and Other Issues
12.
The government recognizes the importance of creating conditions conducive to privatesector-led growth over the medium and long term. We have submitted our National Development
Strategy as an Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. We will finalize shortly the medium-term
development plan that specifies infrastructure projects consistent with our national priorities.
Structural reforms outlined above will facilitate private sector growth by clarifying the tax regime and
improving access to finance. We are currently engaged in a process of defining reform priorities for
inclusive growth and shared prosperity. With the support of the World Bank, we will prepare an
assessment of hardship and vulnerability, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2014. This
will provided the basis for the preparation of a Poverty Reduction Strategy, which would help focus
policy reforms and investment priorities more clearly on the objectives of reducing hardship and
fostering broadly based improvements in living standards in an actionable plan.
13.
We will continue to improve the quality of our economic statistics. Our National Statistics
Office has just compiled national accounts for the period 2007-12, with a breakdown both on
production and on expenditure side. We are working on improving the compilation of price statistics
and we are preparing the introduction of core CPI. We are also getting ready to disseminate the
Census report. We have completed data collection for the Household Income and Expenditure Survey,
which will be an important input for the Poverty Reduction Strategy.

D. Program Monitoring
14.
Program monitoring. Progress under our program will continue to be monitored through
performance criteria and indicative targets, structural benchmarks, and other necessary measures in
order to complete semi-annual program reviews. Quantitative performance criteria and indicative
targets for September 2013, December 2013, March 2014, and June 2014 are set out in Table 1 and
structural benchmarks are set out in Table 2. They are guided by the Technical Memorandum of
Understanding. The third and fourth reviews are expected to take place on or after June 15, 2014 and
November 15, 2014, respectively.

Monetary Aggregates

A.

Reserve Money

6.
Reserve money consists of currency issued by the CBSI (excluding CBSI holdings of
currency) and all transferable deposits held at the CBSI.
B.

Net International Reserves of the CBSI

7.
A floor applies to the level of NIR of the CBSI. The floor on NIR will be adjusted upward
(downward) by the amount of budget support from bilateral and multilateral donors (excluding
the IMF) in excess (short) of the programmed level.
8.
NIR will be calculated as gross international reserves (GIR) less international reserve
liabilities. For NIR program monitoring purposes, the stock of foreign assets and foreign liabilities
of the CBSI will be reported in U.S. dollars and be valued at the program exchange rates, as
specified in Table 1.

are under the direct and effective control of the CBSI and readily available for
intervention in the foreign exchange market or the direct financing of balance of
payments imbalances and are of investment grade or held with an investment-grade
institution.



The reserve position of the Solomon Islands in the IMF;

11.

Excluded from the definition of GIR are:


Foreign currency deposits of ODCs and OFCs held at the CBSI;



Any foreign currency claims on residents, capital subscriptions in international
institutions, and foreign currency assets in nonconvertible currencies, and;



GIR that are in any way encumbered or pledged, including, but not limited to, reserve
assets used as collateral or guarantee for third-party external liabilities.

International reserve liabilities of the CBSI are defined as the sum of:
 All outstanding liabilities of the Solomon Islands to the IMF, excluding IMF SDR
allocations; and
 Foreign currency liabilities in convertible currencies to nonresidents with an original
maturity of up to and including one year.

C.

Net Domestic Assets of the CBSI

12.
A ceiling applies to the level of NDA of the CBSI. The ceiling on NDA will be adjusted
downward (upward) by the amount of budget support from bilateral and multilateral donors
(excluding the IMF) in excess (short) of the programmed level.
13.
NDA of the CBSI will be calculated as the difference between reserve money and the sum
of NIR of the CBSI and other NFA of the CBSI. Any revisions to the historical stock of reserve
money based on changes to the accounting treatment of the profit/loss account of the CBSI will
be notified to the Fund immediately and used to adjust monetary aggregates by an equivalent
amount, as deemed appropriate. Other NFA of the CBSI includes:
 Foreign assets related to holdings of foreign currency deposits, and securities not
included in NIR of the CBSI, and loans, shares, financial derivatives, or accounts receivable
with nonresidents; and other foreign assets that are not included in NIR of the CBSI, as
defined in Section III. B; and
 Foreign liabilities related to IMF SDR allocations; deposits, securities, loans, financial
derivatives, and other accounts payable with nonresidents; and other foreign liabilities
that are not included in NIR of the CBSI, as defined in Section III. B.
D.

Net Credit to the Central Government

14.
A ceiling applies to the NCG measured cumulatively from the beginning of the year. The
ceiling on NCG will be adjusted upward by the amount of budget support from bilateral and
multilateral donors (excluding the IMF) short of the programmed level.
56

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOLOMON ISLANDS

15.
NCG is defined as the sum of net claims of: (i) the CBSI, (ii) commercial banks and other
ODCs, (iii) OFCs, (iv) insurance companies, (v) and government treasury bills held by the general
public.
IV.

Fiscal Aggregates

A.

Cash Balance of the Central Government

16.
A floor applies to the program cash balance of the central government. The floor on the
program cash balance will be adjusted downward by the amount of budget support from
bilateral and multilateral donors (excluding the IMF) in short of the programmed level. The floor
on the program cash balance will also be adjusted upward (downward) by the stock of
government treasury bills, excluding restructured government bonds, in excess (short) of the
program level of SI$40 million. The floor on the program cash balance will be adjusted upward
by the difference between SI$140 million (hereafter known as program level) in the SIG
Consolidated Deposits Account and its actual balance, should the actual balance in the SIG
Consolidated Deposits Account be lower than SI$140 million.
17.
The program cash balance of the central government is defined as the gross cash
balance minus the total amount of unpaid payment orders and unpresented checks.
18.
The gross cash balance is defined as the sum of government deposits, which are not in
any way encumbered or pledged as collateral or used as a guarantee against government
incurred liabilities, in the following accounts:
 In CBSI: Solomon Islands Government (SIG) Revenue Account, SIG Funded Development
Account, SIG Debt Servicing Account;
 In Australia New Zealand Bank: SIG Creditors Account; Payroll Imprest Account, and
Airport Service Fees Account;
 In Bank of South Pacific: Provincial Revenue Holding Account, SIG Inland Revenue
Account, Sub Treasury Gizo Account, and Sub Treasury Auki Account; and
 Donor funded budget support accounts that are created by and under control of
the government.
V. External Debt

A.

Medium- and Long-Term External Debt

19.
A ceiling applies to the contracting and guaranteeing by the public sector of new
nonconcessional borrowing with nonresidents with original maturities of more than one year.
The ceiling applies to debt and commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not
yet been received. This applies to private debt for which official guarantees have been extended

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

57

SOLOMON ISLANDS

and which, therefore, constitutes a contingent liability of the public sector. The public sector
comprises the central government, the CBSI, nonfinancial public enterprises (i.e., enterprises in
which the government owns more than 50 percent of the shares), and other official entities.
20.
The definition of debt, for the purposes of the program, is set out in Point 9 of the
Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to External Debt in Fund Arrangement Executive
Board Decision No. 6230-(79/140), as revised on August 31, 2009 (see Annex I).
21.
Excluded from the ceiling are (i) the use of Fund resources; (ii) lending from the World
Bank and the Asian Development Bank; (iii) debts incurred to restructure, refinance, or prepay
existing debts, to the extent that such debt is incurred on more favorable terms than the existing
debt and up to the amount of the actually restructured/refinanced/prepaid debt;
(iv) concessional debts; (v) any SI$-denominated treasury bill and bond holdings and Bokolo
bonds held by nonresidents.
22.
For program purposes, the guarantee of a debt arises from any explicit legal obligation of
the central government, the CBSI, nonfinancial public enterprises, or other official entities on
behalf of the central government or the CBSI to service debt in the event of nonpayment by the
main obligor (involving payments in cash or in kind).
23.
For program purposes, a debt is concessional if it includes a grant element of at least
35 percent, calculated as follows: the grant element of a debt is the difference between the net
present value (NPV) of debt and its nominal value, expressed as a percentage of the nominal
value of the debt. The NPV of debt at the time of its contracting is calculated by discounting the
future stream of payments of debt service due on this debt. The discount rate used for this
purpose is five percent.
B.

Short-Term External Debt

24.
A ceiling applies to the contracting and guaranteeing by the public sector of new
nonconcessional borrowing with nonresidents with original maturities of up to and including one
year. The ceiling applies to debt and commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has
not yet been received. This applies to private debt for which official guarantees have been
extended and which, therefore, constitute a contingent liability of the public sector. The public
sector comprises the central government, the CBSI, nonfinancial public enterprises (i.e.,
enterprises in which the government owns more than 50 percent of the shares), and other official
entities.
25.
For program purposes, the definition of debt is set out in Point 9 of the Guidelines on
Performance Criteria with Respect to External Debt in Fund Arrangement approved by the
Executive Board Decision No. 6230-(79/140), as revised on August 31, 2009 (see Annex I).
26.
Excluded from the ceiling are (i) debts classified as international reserve liabilities of the
CBSI; (ii) debts incurred to restructure, refinance, or prepay existing debts, to the extent that such
debt is incurred on more favorable terms than the existing debt and up to the amount of the
58

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOLOMON ISLANDS

actually restructured/refinanced/prepaid debt; (iii) SI$-denominated treasury bills and bonds and
CBSI and Bokolo bills held by nonresidents; (iv) concessional debts; and (v) normal import
financing. A financing arrangement for imports is considered to be “normal” when the credit is
self-liquidating.
VI. External Payment Arrears
27.
A continuous performance criterion applies to the non-accumulation of external
payments arrears by the public sector, comprising the central government, the CBSI, nonfinancial
public enterprises, and other official entities. External payments arrears consist of external debtservice obligations (principal and interest) that have not been paid at the time they are due, as
specified in the contractual agreement, subject to any applicable grace period.
VII. Tertiary Education
28.
Approval will be sought from Cabinet to strengthen the policy of the granting of tertiary
scholarships, which will contain at least the following elements:
 Commitment controls. The Ministry of Finance will certify the availability of budget
allocation before any new award letters can be granted, in order to ensure that the
budget ceilings are abided by and no new arrears are incurred. Commitment
information will be entered into the Ministry of Finance’s Financial Management
Information System to record commitments made for each individual scholarship
awardee. The Ministry of Education will ensure that the documentation relating to
identification and eligibility, expected length of studies, as well as due dates for tuition
and stipend payments is provided to the Ministry of Finance in a timely manner.
 Queuing system. If there are more candidates for scholarships than resources available in
a fiscal year, a queuing policy for eligible applicants based on the timing of their
application will be established.
 Arrears. All arrears will be cleared and no new arrears allowed.
 Documentation. In consultation with the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Education
will establish the standards for eligibility documentation and documentation retention
for each application. The required and retained documentation should include at least
the application form, high school transcript, receipt for the payment of the application
fee, copy of Ministry award letter, signed declaration letter, transcripts of results in each
semester from tertiary institutions and qualifications attained by the scholarship holders.
 Monitoring and dissemination. The Ministry of Education will produce regular reports on
total number of applicants for scholarships, number granted scholarships, current
number of students classified by gender and educational institutions, and number of
terminations or fails in the last 12 months. The Ministry of Education will publish the
guidelines for obtaining scholarships and publish their periodic reports.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

59

SOLOMON ISLANDS

 Tuition and Fee Rates. The Ministry of Education will sign a memoranda of
understanding the USP and other tertiary institutions, including to establish the basis of
the financial commitment of the Solomon Islands Government.
 Allowances. The Ministry of Education, in consultation with the Ministry of Finance, will
recommend an allowances policy with specific allowance amounts that vary for students
depending on the institutions where they study, the course that they are undertaking,
employment status, travel requirements, whether studies are full-time or part-time, the
length of the program in which they are enrolled and the number of years they have
received the grant.
VIII. Data Provision
29.
The data listed below will be provided for monitoring performance under the program
based on data templates agreed with Fund staff. Under each section, reporting responsibilities
are indicated in parentheses. Weekly data are requested for submission to Fund staff by the end
of the following week. Monthly and quarterly data are requested for submission within six weeks
of the end of the observation period. The authorities have committed to using the best available
data, so that any subsequent data revisions will not lead to a breach of quantitative performance
criteria or benchmarks. All revisions to data will be promptly reported to Fund staff.

ANNEX I. GUIDELINES ON PERFORMANCE CRITERIA WITH RESPECT TO FOREIGN DEBT
Excerpt from Executive Board Decision No. 6230-(79/140), as revised on August 31, 2009
1.

(a)
For the purpose of this guideline, the term “debt” will be understood to
mean a current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual
arrangement through the provision of value in the form of assets (including
currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or more
payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some future
point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest
liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the
primary ones being as follows:
(i)
loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made
on the basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the
future (including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans and
buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to
fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is required to repay the
funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the
buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and official swap
arrangements);
(ii)
suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the
obligor to defer payments until sometime after the date on which the
goods are delivered or services are provided; and
(iii)
leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which
the lessee has the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time
that are usually shorter than the total expected service life of the
property, while the lessor retains the title to the property. For the purpose
of the guideline, the debt is the present value (at the inception of the
lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the
agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair or
maintenance of the property.
(b)
Under the definition of debt set out in point 9 (a) above, arrears,
penalties, and judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make
payment under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to
make payment on an obligation that is not considered debt under this definition
(e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt

The exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The Solomon Islands dollar is pegged
to an invoice-based basket of currencies consisting of the U.S. dollar (with the weight of 58
percent), the Australian dollar (32 percent), the New Zealand dollar (5 percent), the Japanese
yen (3 percent), and the British pound (2 percent). The Central Bank of Solomon Islands sets
the exchange rate vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar in such a way as to maintain the value of the
basket constant in Solomon Islands dollars given the movements of currencies in the basket
relative to each other. However, the exchange rate of the Solomon Islands dollar against the
U.S. dollar is not allowed to deviate from the “base” rate by more than one percent in either
direction. This regime was introduced in October 2012, replacing a peg to the U.S. dollar. The
initial base rate equaled SBD7.36 per USD, which was the parity under the U.S. dollar peg,
but in June 2013 the base rate was adjusted to SBD7.28 per USD. Solomon Islands maintains
an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions.

The 2011 Article IV Consultation discussions were held in Honiara during September 29–

Executive Board and the consultation concluded on November 23, 2011.

SUPPORT FROM THE PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL
ASSISTANCE CENTER1
Solomon Islands: PFTAC Country Strategy 2013–15
Background
The Solomon Islands has recovered well from a precarious position during the global economic
crisis. Growth has accelerated rapidly and international and fiscal reserves increased, on the back of
increased logging and mining, but also due to better fiscal management and increased international
assistance. The medium-term reform agenda under the Core Economic Working Group emphasizes,
amongst other things, strengthening of public financial management in particular with regard to the
management of natural resource revenues.
Solomon Islands has been a moderate user of PFTAC TA. Despite the large international
presence, mainly through RAMSI which caters for much of the technical assistance needs in the
government, PFTAC has made specific technical contributions in particular with regard to the fiscal
regime for natural resources. In the PFM area, PFTAC has reviewed and provided suggestions on a
draft PFM law and provided follow up support to a revision of accounting standards. Significant
amounts of support have been provided to CBSI in formulating and implementing new prudential
regulations for banks and also in developing a more robust inflation forecasting regime.
Strategy 2013-2015
PFTAC’s TA strategy is guided by the APD regional strategy note and is planned within the ResultsBased Management (RBM) framework for the current PFTAC funding cycle.2 The main focus of PFTAC
TA will be on strengthening fiscal management, particularly with regard to natural resource
management and solidifying the financial sector. In the Government area inputs will either be at the
strategic/policy level or dealing with niche requirements where IMF/PFTAC has a comparative
advantage. Support for implementation is expected to continue to come from other donors, in the
context of RAMSI or its successor.

In the Public Financial Management area, following on the results from the 2012 PEFA, the main
focus is expected to be assisting the authorities to develop a revised PFM Roadmap in the context of

The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center in Suva, Fiji, is a regional technical assistance institution operated
by the IMF with financial support of the Asian Development Bank, Australia, Japan, Korea, and New Zealand. The
Center’s aim is to build skills and institutional capacity for effective economic and financial management that can be
sustained at the national level. Member countries are: Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati,
Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor Leste, Tokelau, Tonga,
Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.

the Core Economic Working Group. The process will guide the need for any PFTAC support to
implementation, but priorities are likely to be follow-up on accounting reform, developing
implementing instructions for a PFM law approved in 2013, and development of systems to
appropriately manage natural resource revenues (including fiscal responsibility provisions). The
authorities have also requested assistance with training on Cash Basis IPSAS for provincial
governments.
In the revenue area, the Solomon Islands receives significant revenue administration support from
New Zealand Inland Revenue Department (NZID) under RAMSI TA and this assistance is expected to
continue to be in place for some time. PFTAC has supported the development of natural resources
administrative skills through a recent “international tax” regional workshop and is developing a more
detailed program that will be carried out in 2014. It is anticipated that Solomon Islands would figure
strongly in that program. The 2013 Pacific Islands Tax Administrators Association (PITAA) was held in
Solomon Islands in September 2013 and a general review of Solomon Islands TA needs was carried
out at that time. The authorities indicated that the development of a new revenue administration
regime was under consideration and PFTAC confirmed that it would provide TA to support for this
initiative. The authorities were also reminded of an existing PFTAC recommendation to implement a
VAT and PFTAC re-affirmed its commitment to support Solomon Islands should it decide to adopt
the recommendation.
In financial sector supervision, making use of PFTAC support, the CBSI has made great strides in
improving its on-site supervision. As a result of extensive assistance over the past year, supervisors
now have the skills and processes to effectively carry out on-site examinations of banking
institutions with a lower level of technical assistance-probably with one visit a year from the PFTAC
advisor for onsite examination. Additionally support has been provided in September 2013 to the
CBSI as they act as the pilot for the implementation of the Reserve Bank of New
Zealand’s information technology system to enhance supervision. Technical advisory assistance will
also be provided in strengthening the oversight of credit unions.
In statistics, PFTAC has recently assisted the NSO enhance national accounts by incorporating
historical business survey results back to 2003 and improving the methodology for the compilation
of GDP estimates by production and by expenditures. The main focus of follow-up TA will be to
complement inputs by the resident statistics advisor funded by donors, with a particular focus on
expanding the range of aggregates available in the national accounts and on future rebase of GDP
estimates by production and by expenditures. Methodological improvements and support to further
develop external sector statistics and government finance statistics are supported by HQ TA. PFTAC
also supported the implementation of the recommendations made by an IMF HQ mission in 2012 to
improve the methodology and data sources for the CPI.

In the macroeconomic area, work in previous years has focused on building macroeconomic
modeling and analysis capacity in CBSI with the aim of having better inflation and external forecasts
to feed into monetary policy making. In 2012, this was complemented by development of a financial
programming framework involving staffs from both the Ministry of Finance and CBSI, based on the
macroeconomic framework. Going forward, the task is to provide training in the effective use of this
framework as well as deepen skills in macroeconomic analysis and forecasting.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of December 2013)
1.
The Bank and the Fund teams led by Mr. Robert Utz (Lead Economist, World Bank Sydney
Office) and Mr. Luis Breuer (IMF Mission Chief for Solomon Islands) maintain a regular dialogue on
macroeconomic and structural issues. In recent years, collaborative efforts have focused on the joint
Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Analysis and regular discussions during missions and at headquarters.
Visiting IMF missions regularly meet Bank staff in their Honiara office, led by Ms. Anne Tully (World
Bank Country Representative), and at headquarters.
2.
The teams agree that the key priorities for Solomon Islands include consolidating the recent
improvement in the country’s macro-fiscal framework in the face of ongoing volatility in external
conditions, improving the quality of public spending to ensure public resources support the access
to basic social services, improvements in the investment climate to support business development,
and ensuring state-owned enterprises can sustainably provide public services.
3.
The risks to the economy, from slippages in domestic policy decisions or a deterioration in
external conditions remain considerable. Ongoing efforts to strengthen Solomon Islands’ economic
management and reinforce protective buffers are to be supported, as are efforts to improve the
quality of spending.
4.
The Bank and Fund teams agree that the focus has shifted to the medium-term reform
agenda. Priority issues include developing a more coordinated and prioritized approach to
weaknesses in public financial management systems and ensuring that the reforms achieved to date
are sustained and become regular practice, identifying policy reform priorities for fostering inclusive
growth and reducing hardship, ensuring budget allocations are better achieve the priority of
improving delivery of social services, and of strengthening the climate for investments and including
mining regulation. Between the Bank and the Fund, the Bank takes the lead in public expenditure
management framework and structural reform issues, and the Fund will continue to take the lead on
macro issues.

5.
The Banks and Fund teams agree to continue close collaboration, mainly with regular contact
through the Bank’s Honiara and Sydney offices, the IMF regional resident representative office in
Suva, and at headquarters. The Fund will also continue to collaborate with the government-donor
Core Economic Working Group convened regularly in Honiara by the Ministry of Finance and
Treasury with World Bank support. Appendix I provides a list of planned activities in the coming year.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of November 2013)
Since joining the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) in 1973, Solomon Islands has received 17 loans
amounting to US$89.81 million, 9 Asian Development Fund grants amounting to US$68.80 million,
and 66 technical assistance (TA) projects amounting to US$23.50 million.
The AsDB’s Country Partnership Strategy (2012–16) was endorsed in March 2012. The strategy seeks
to reduce poverty in line with the government’s national development strategy, 2011–20, by
promoting equitable private sector-led economic growth through assistance in three core areas:
transport, and information and communication technology; public sector management; and energy.
Private sector development, capacity development, and the promotion of good governance are
thematic priorities.1
In line with the improvements in its public debt situation, Solomon Islands’ borrowing status was
changed by the AsDB from grant-only to a 50:50 mix of grants and concessionary loans, as of 1
January 2011.
Transport, and information and communication technology. Building on AsDB’s Transport Sector
Development Project, AsDB will continue to support a sector-wide approach to management and
development of a multimodal transport system. A proposed Phase 2 of the Transport Sector
Development Project will support maintenance and improvement of the national integrated
transport network including land (roads and bridges), marine (wharves and ports), and aviation
(airport runways and airports) in line with the implementation framework of the national transport
plan. Complementary to the transport initiatives, the ongoing Solomon Islands Broadband for
Development Project approved in September 2012 also helps improve rural connectivity. The
submarine cable system, which will be financed by both sovereign and nonsovereign investments,
will deliver good-quality, high-speed internet services at affordable prices to Solomon Islanders in
both urban and rural areas.
Public sector management. Fiscal stability and a competitive business environment are essential to
fostering private sector-led growth and development. In coordination with development partners
and operating through the Core Economic Working Group, AsDB will continue supporting the
government-led public sector management reforms with policy-based programs. The main goal of
AsDB’s assistance in public sector management is to improve the enabling environment for privatesector led, inclusive growth and development. In line with the Core Economic Working Group
medium-term economic and financial reform program, a fourth policy-based program grant has

been programed for 2015. This follows AsDB’s program grants approved in 2010, 2011, and 2013.
AsDB will continue to provide TA to support public sector management reforms, including
commercial legal reform, state-owned enterprise reform, improving access to finance, and
implementation of the national development strategy, and support to the government audit
functions.
Energy. Access to clean and affordable power is needed to allow producers of commodities and
other goods on the outer islands to diversify production and improve livelihoods. AsDB support will
complement the efforts of other partners in energy sector reform through sustainable off-grid power
services. A pilot project to build small hydropower generators and increase access to modern energy
services in selected growth centers is planned for 2014. A power sector development project is
planned for 2016, with a preparatory TA project in 2015.
The AsDB’s Pacific Liaison and Coordination Office in Sydney is responsible for country
programming and project implementation in Solomon Islands, supported by the Pacific Operations
Division in Manila.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: Recent technical assistance (TA) from the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center has led
to improvements in national accounts at constant and current prices. GDP estimates through 2012 on the
production side and the expenditure side were released in October 2013. While limited data on employment can
be obtained from the National Provident Fund, wage data are not compiled.
Price statistics: A monthly consumer price index (CPI) is produced with a short lag (about a month), but covers
only the capital Honiara. The weights of this index were revised in 2007, based on the results of the 2005–06
Household Income and Expenditure Survey. The authorities plan to compile a nationwide CPI, and have already
compiled a list of goods to be contained in the basket. However, the timing of actual compilation is unclear due to
lack of funds. TA has been provided on the development of an import price index but, due to resource constraints,
there has been little progress in implementation. A PFTAC mission reviewed CPI in January 2012, and the
recommendations still need to be implemented. The development of a core inflation index has been largely
completed and estimates should be released soon.
Government finance statistics: Monthly fiscal data for the central government are published by the Ministry of
Finance and Treasury (MOFT). The authorities have started collecting disbursement information on donors’ grants,
including those nonappropriated in the budget. Monthly public debt data are published, and the quality debt data
has improved through better coordination between the MOFT and the Central Bank of Solomon Islands (CBSI).
Monetary and financial statistics: The CBSI publishes monthly monetary and financial statistics (MFS) in summary
form and reports data for the central bank, other depository corporations and other financial corporations to the
IMF’s Statistics Department using the standardized report forms (SRFs). An integrated monetary database meeting
the monetary data needs of the CBSI, APD and STA is in operation. Financial soundness indicators are reported
quarterly.
External Sector Statistics: The CBSI has been compiling quarterly balance of payment statistics (BPS) using its
own survey since 2006. Compared to the previous method, which was based on foreign exchange transactions
reported through the banking system, the newly compiled BPS has improved both coverage and data accuracy.
However, these quarterly data have not yet been reported to the IMF's Statistics Department. Solomon Islands has
been one of the beneficiaries of the Japan Administered Account (JSA) Project on the improvement of external
sector statistics. A TA mission under this project was conducted in 2013, with more missions planned.
II. Data Standards and Quality
No data ROSC available.
Solomon Islands has participated in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) starting in 2011.
III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
No data are currently reported to STA for publication in the Government Finance Statistics.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION AND
SECOND REVIEW UNDER THE EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY
ARRANGEMENT AND REQUEST FOR MODIFICATION OF
PERFORMANCE CRITERION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

Approved By
Asia and Pacific
Department, IMF

Prepared by Staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
World Bank

and Jeffrey D. Lewis and Sudhir Shetty (World Bank)

The Solomon Islands continues to face a moderate risk of external debt distress owing to
possible shocks to non-debt-creating flows and financing terms. Containing the risk of
debt distress will require continued efforts to maintain fiscal buffers, strengthen the
budget process to improve fiscal discipline and the quality of spending, and implement
structural reforms that are essential for promoting broad-based growth.

This DSA update was prepared in the context of the second review of the ECF arrangements that took place
in October 2013. It updates the last full joint Bank-Fund DSA conducted in November 2012 (SM/12/333). A
post-mortem of the November 2012 DSA is not included given that the medium and long term assumptions
and conclusions remain broadly unchanged. The DSA update is based on the common standard LIC DSA
framework. Under the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), the Solomon Islands is rated a weak
performer, and the DSA uses the indicative threshold indicators on the external public debt for countries in
this category: 30 percent for the present value (PV) of debt-to-GDP ratio; 100 percent for the PV of the debtto-export ratio; 200 percent for the PV of the debt-to-revenue ratio; 15 percent for the debt-service-to-exports
ratio; and 18 percent for the debt-service-to-revenue ratio. The Solomon Islands’ fiscal year begins on January
1.

SOLOMON ISLANDS

ASSUMPTIONS AND RECENT DEBT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Context. As described in the 2012 DSA, fiscal buffers have been rebuilt in the Solomon Islands in
recent years. Total public debt fell to about 17½ percent of GDP at the end of 2012 from some 60 percent
in 2005 under the framework of the Honiara Club Agreement (HCA). The Debt Management Strategy
(DMS) endorsed by Cabinet in 2012 provides a framework to anchor borrowing plans going forward.
2.
Assumptions. Key macroeconomic assumptions were revised in the context of the second review
of the Solomon Islands’ ECF, taking into account developments through mid-2013. The scaling-down of the
operations of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) at the end of 2012 and the
revision in the Gold Ridge gold mine capacity result in a further deterioration in the trade and current
account balance in the medium term. The discount rate used to calculate the net present value (NPV) of the
external debt was changed from three to five percent (SM/13/271).2 Box 1 summarizes the key
assumptions.
Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions under the Baseline Scenario


GDP growth and inflation. After rebounding to nearly 11 percent in 2011, growth has slowed and is
projected to moderate to 3½ percent over the medium and long term. GDP deflator growth is likely to
decline from recent rates but remain near historical levels at 5½ percent.



Logging and mining. Log production is expected to decline by about 7 percent each year until 2025
after which it will remain stable. With the transfer of Gold Ridge ownership, gold production has been
revised downwards to 64,000 ounces in 2013 and maximum capacity to 76,000 ounces.



Aid flows and FDI. Aid flows declined in 2012 with the scaling-down of the operations of the Regional
Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI).There was also a number of major capital projects
completed by donors in 2012, skewing the allocation between current and capital account donor
transfers. The ratio is projected to return to historical norm going forward. As a result, aid flows are
expected to average about 15 percent over the medium term and 9 percent over the long term. FDI is
projected at about 8 percent over the medium term and 6 percent over the longer term, with
resumption in external borrowing making up the difference in financing the current account deficit.



External borrowing. New loan disbursements are expected to begin in 2014 to finance the undersea
fiber optic cable. Concessional borrowing is projected to average about 2½ percent of GDP annually
over the next five years and 3½ percent over the longer term.



Fiscal outlook. The primary balance is expected to generate a deficit of about 1 percent of GDP in the

2

IMF Staff Paper on ‘Unification of Discount Rates Used In External Debt Analysis for Low-Income Countries’, 4
October, 2013. The system of discount rates was complex, with different discount rates applying to different
currencies, linked to market interest rates in different ways and updated with varying frequencies. Further, the
methodology for determining the discount rate produced an unwarranted tightening of assessed borrowing space
available to LICs in recent years, especially following the easing in monetary conditions since 2009. The discount rate
fell by 2 percentage points between 2009 and 2013, to 3 percent, pushing up the estimated present value of LIC debt
and reducing the assessed borrowing space available to LICs. A uniform discount rate, used for both present value
and grant element calculations in the Debt Sustainability Analysis addresses the unnecessary complexity and is
consistent with the convergence of long-term interest rates across major economies. Resetting the discount rate set
to 5 percent broadly aligns it with the discount rate currently used for calculating the grant element of long-term U.S.
dollar-denominated loans.

medium and long term. This shift is attributable to the projected fall in grants, and logging and mining
revenues while additional external borrowing would only partially substitute for previously grant-funded
development expenditure. Revenue (excluding grants) is forecast at about 27 percent of GDP over the
longer term.

 The non-interest current account deficit is projected to increase to about 12½ percent in the next
two years reflecting a number of import intensive projects in the pipeline (the undersea cable, Soltuna
and USP campus expansions). The higher deficit over the medium term reflects the major downward
revision in gold mine capacity.

External debt. Despite the amendment of the Honiara Club Agreement (HCA) to allow for external
borrowing to resume, the Solomon Islands government has not contracted new external debt in
2013 due to delays in the start of the undersea cable project. The gross external public and publicly
guaranteed (PPG) debt is expected to decline to 11.3 percent of GDP by the end of 2013. Total
public sector debt is expected to decline to 14½ percent.

EXTERNAL AND PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
ANALYSIS
A. External Debt Sustainability Analysis
3.
Under the baseline scenario all external PPG debt indicators remain below the policyrelevant thresholds. Total external debt is projected to gradually increase starting in 2014, reaching 38
percent of GDP over the longer term. Similarly, PPG external debt is projected to rise to 34½ percent of
GDP. In present value (PV) terms all key indicators of sustainability – the GDP, revenue, and export ratios of
PPG external debt and PPG external debt service – remain well below the indicative thresholds (Figure 1).3
4.
Sensitivity analysis suggests that the Solomon Islands’ debt path is vulnerable to shocks to
net non-debt-creating flows and financing terms (Table 1b, and Figure 1). A shock to non-debtcreating flows lowers the net current transfers and net FDI 2014-15 to one standard deviation below the
historical average.4 Such a shock would lead the PV of PPG external debt to exports to breach the threshold
during 2028-2033. A permanent shock to financing terms is defined as an interest rate that is 2 percentage
points higher during 2013–33 than in the baseline. Such a shock would keep the PV of PPG external-debtto-GDP ratio above the threshold starting in 2032 and the PV of PPG external-debt-to-exports ratio starting
2028.
3

The negative residuals in Table 1a reflect the fact that part of the current account deficit is being financed through
the aid in kind for capital projects from donors. These inflows are reflected in the capital account but are not captured
in the identified net debt-creating flows, which only correct for FDI inflows. The positive residuals in Table 2a reflect
the assumption that mineral revenue expected in coming years will be saved in a special fund to support health,
education, and infrastructure.
4

The historical (10-year) averages of foreign aid and FDI are 15 percent and 11¼ percent of GDP, respectively,
while the standard deviations of these flows are 8½ percent and 10½ percent of GDP, respectively. The template
does not capture the decline in imports that the shock may induce.

B. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
5.
Public debt analysis paints a similar picture. Under the baseline scenario (Table 2a), the PV of
total public debt will decline further to about 11 percent of GDP over the medium term. Over the longer
term, it is projected to increase to about 22 percent, driven by new external borrowing after the completion
of the HCA review. Public debt sustainability is vulnerable to shocks as well. Under the most extreme stress
test scenario—permanently lower GDP growth—the PV of debt reaches about 30 percent of GDP by 2026
and 50 percent of GDP by 2033 (Table 2b and Figure 2).

CONCLUSIONS
6.
The Solomon Islands continues to face a moderate risk of debt distress, in line with the
conclusion of the 2012 DSA. The baseline scenario does not indicate a breach of thresholds. However,
alternative scenarios and stress tests result in a significant rise in debt indicators over the projection period,
nearing thresholds on PV of PPG external debt in percent of GDP and breaching the thresholds on PV of
PPG external debt in percent of exports. The shock scenarios underscore the importance of caution in
external borrowing and of structural reform measures to broaden the export base in a country that is
heavily reliant on imports, foreign aid, and foreign direct investment.
7.
The authorities have broadly agreed with this assessment. They are fully committed to
strengthening their public finance management framework by developing the implementing regulations
for the Public Finance Act (PFA). A new resource taxation regime that the authorities are working on is
expected to help attract foreign investment. The authorities will further strengthen the debt management
capacity by developing on-lending and guarantees instructions.

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Press Release No. 14/19
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 21, 2014

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Solomon Islands
On January 8, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the 2013 Article IV Consultation with Solomon Islands.1 On the same day, the
Executive Board also completed the second review under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF)
arrangement with Solomon Islands, and approved US$0.23 million disbursement (Press
Release No. 14/06).
Economic growth in Solomon Islands is slowly rebounding from the slowdown of the first
half of 2013, when agriculture, logging, and gold production fell, owing mainly to
unfavorable weather developments, lower terms of trade, and one-off factors. Real GDP
growth is projected at 2.9 percent for 2013 and 4 percent for 2014. Risks are tilted to the
downside, including from lower external demand and grants. Inflation has stabilized at
around 6.5 percent and is expected to fall gradually as agricultural prices react to the
recovery of production.
The under-execution of development spending led to a significant budget surplus in the first
six months of 2013, but fiscal risks have risen. Government revenues for the year are
somewhat lower than expected owing to slower economic growth and weather shocks.
Spending overruns on selected program, including on tertiary scholarships, combined with
the increase in constituency development spending, are putting significant pressure on the
budget.
The financial system is sound, although deepening financial markets remains an important
development challenge. Banks are adequately capitalized, highly liquid, and profitable. Bank
credit continues to recover after the sluggish pace recorded over the last few years. Excess
reserves in the banking system have declined from last year’s level but remain substantial.
The current account balance is expected to deteriorate this year, due to lower exports and
higher imports—the latter on account of higher foreign direct investment—although net
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

international reserves are expected to hold up at close to current levels. The Solomon Islands
dollar was broadly stable against the U.S. dollar during the year, but fluctuations against the
Australian dollar were considerably more pronounced. The central bank is gaining
experience with the transition to a basket peg.
The country continues to face development challenges. Infrastructure needs are large,
particularly with regard to energy supply, transportation, and telecommunications. The
country has achieved significant improvements in the business climate, but still ranks lower
than its regional peers in some areas, such as access to electricity and ease of registering
property.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities’ broadly satisfactory implementation of their
ECF-supported program. Economic growth is gradually recovering and inflation has
stabilized since the second half of 2013. Nonetheless, the country faces significant growth
and development challenges, including from diminishing donor assistance. This will require
continued efforts to strengthen public finances, enhance monetary and exchange rate policies,
safeguard financial stability, and address constraints to broad-based, inclusive growth.
Directors encouraged the authorities to protect policy buffers by keeping overall
expenditure, including from the supplementary budget, within the original spending
envelope, while addressing priority social and development needs. They stressed the
importance of strengthening the quality and efficiency of public spending and the
transparency and accountability of constituency funds and tertiary scholarship awards.
Directors commended the approval of the Public Finance Management Act. They
looked forward to its implementation, and further efforts to enact remaining tax reforms
and to improve debt management.
Directors endorsed the current monetary policy stance. They welcomed the central bank’s
efforts to strengthen monetary policy instruments and readiness to mop up liquidity if
inflationary pressures arise. Directors agreed that the basket peg remains appropriate. They
saw merit in widening the operational band against the U.S. dollar to track the currency
basket more closely. They also highlighted the importance of boosting productivity to
prevent real exchange rate misalignment.
Directors noted that the financial sector is sound. They supported the authorities’ pursuit
of financial sector reform, including plans to strengthen the legal and oversight
frameworks of the financial sector and improve access to financial services.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors underscored the need for new sources of growth as logging activities decline, and
the importance of fostering private sector growth. They urged the authorities to prioritize
investments to ensure reliable access to power, telecommunications, and transportation, and
to promote a transparent tax regime and clear land-use rights. They noted that the right
balance of spending on all levels of education will help meet the economy’s skills needs.

IMF Completes Second Review Under the Extended Credit Facility Arrangement
for Solomon Islands
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the
second review of Solomon Islands' economic performance under the Extended
Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement. The Executive Board also approved a request for
modification of the end-December 2013 performance criterion on net credit to the
government.
Completion of the second review enables Solomon Islands to draw an amount
equivalent to SDR 0.149 million (about US$0.23 million) immediately, bringing total
disbursements under the arrangement to an amount equivalent to SDR 0.446 million
(about US$ 0.68 million).
The three-year ECF arrangement was approved on December 7, 2012, in an amount
equivalent to SDR 1.04 million (about US$1.59 million), or 10 percent of the country’s
quota (see Press Release No. 12/479).
Following the Executive Board’s discussion on Solomon Islands, Mr. Min Zhu, Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“The Solomon Islands authorities are to be commended for the broadly satisfactory
implementation of their economic and financial program supported under the ECF..
Sound policies helped the economy deal with adverse shocks in the first half of 2013.
However, the scaling down of development assistance by donors and downside
external risks pose significant challenges. It will be important to strengthen public
finances, enhance monetary and exchange rate policy, safeguard financial stability,
and bolster the sources of growth.”
“Policy buffers should be protected by keeping overall public expenditure, including
from the supplementary budget, within the original spending envelope. The quality
of public spending should be improved through greater transparency and

2
accountability and by implementing the newly-approved Public Finance
Management Act. Remaining fiscal reforms should be completed, including adoption
of a new mining tax regime and a new customs and excise law.”
“The central bank should continue to strengthen its monetary policy instruments and
stand ready to mop up liquidity should inflationary pressures arise. The basket peg
remains appropriate. Widening the operational band against the U.S. dollar would
help reap the full benefit of the peg.”
“Banks remain adequately capitalized and profitable. The authorities’ efforts to
strengthen the legal and oversight frameworks of the financial system should be
continued.”
“Diversification will be crucial for sustained and inclusive growth. Critical
infrastructure bottlenecks in power, telecommunications, and transportation should
be addressed. A clear and transparent tax regime and improved access to finance will
also facilitate private sector growth.”

Statement by Mr. Jong-won Yoon, Executive Director and Ms. Vicki Plater, Advisor
January 8, 2014
The Solomon Islands authorities consider the ECF is valuable to promote continued
macroeconomic and financial stability and build momentum for reform, and they
remain firmly committed to this three-year program. The program is helping to
strengthen the institutional framework to ensure enduring improvements to macroeconomic
and public financial management, and to address structural issues that hold back
improvements in living standards for Solomon Islanders. The ECF (and predecessor SCF
arrangements) have helped strengthen donor support and the ongoing success of the program
will help to build confidence with development partners.
The key challenges facing Solomon Islands (and other small Pacific Island states) –
small size, remoteness, and a dispersed population; a narrow economic base; and
vulnerability to natural disasters and external shocks – cannot be easily overcome. The past
six months has, however, seen the significant milestone of the withdrawal of the military
component of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), part of the
Solomon Islands’ landscape for a decade following the period of civil conflict known as the
“ethnic tensions” (1998 to 2003). RAMSI has partnered with Solomon Islands to lay the
foundations for stability, security and prosperity. RAMSI’s police presence will be
maintained until 2017 and its remaining development work and assistance is transferring to
bilateral and multilateral aid programs. The outlook more generally is that donor assistance
in the future will be at lower levels than currently.
Progress under the ECF has been steady. All of the June 2013 performance criteria (PCs),
indicative targets, and continuous PCs were met. There has been progress with structural
reforms. Significantly, the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA) was approved by
Parliament ahead of schedule in September. This critical reform provides Solomon Islands
with a modern financial and legislative framework that will encourage fiscal responsibility
(through a focus on sustainable levels of Government expenditure, revenue and public debt)
and promote greater transparency and accountability. This will support the more efficient,
effective and ethical use of public resources. Nevertheless, other structural reforms have not
progressed as quickly as hoped due to capacity constraints and the attention given to
advancing the PFMA. In particular, weakened staff resources in the Attorney-General’s
Chambers have delayed legislative reform in respect of the tax changes for mining; the
revised National Provident Fund Act; and the new Customs and Excise law. The authorities
are actively addressing this constraint with support from the Asian Development Bank to
supplement capacity, and are giving priority to ECF program-related legislation.

2
Economic Developments
The economy faced several adverse shocks in the first half of 2013, including a significant
terms of trade deterioration, poor weather conditions affecting agricultural production, and
more subdued gold production due to the refurbishment of the Gold Ridge mine. The
economy is expected to grow by 2.9 percent this year, down from around 5 percent in 2012,
and lift to 4 percent growth in 2014 boosted by recovering agriculture and gold production.
Inflation has stabilized in recent months and was 5.5 percent in October (3 month moving
average).
As noted by staff, key short-term risks are to the downside: weaker demand from
offshore markets; lower commodity prices for Solomon Island exports; higher oil prices; and
the risk of lower foreign grant financing. In conjunction with the updated Debt Sustainability
Analysis which shows Solomon Islands continues to face a moderate risk of external debt
distress owing to possible shocks, these risks highlight the importance of continuing to
strengthen economic and fiscal buffers to ward against any shocks.
Fiscal Policy
Government revenues are now projected to be around 0.5 percent of GDP lower than
was projected at the time of the first review, reflecting lower growth, reduced revenue from
excises on tobacco and alcohol, and weaker revenues from fishing licenses. In light of this,
the authorities have requested a small modification of the PC on net credit to the government.
Several challenges have also emerged on the expenditure side, with authorizations for
sizeable increases in expenditure in certain areas – most particularly tertiary scholarships.
The Solomon Islands authorities consider tertiary scholarships are vital to support the
country’s future development prospects and to provide opportunities for the youth.
Nevertheless, the rapid increase in tertiary scholarship expenditure and emergence of arrears
revealed weaknesses. The authorities are determined to ensure spending on tertiary
scholarships is responsible, managed within a budget, and applies best practices in public
financial management. As such, corrective action is underway with the Ministry of
Education and the Ministry of Finance and Treasury working closely to improve the policies
and processes related to tertiary scholarships. Revised policies will go to Cabinet for
approval by the end of January so that they may come into effect for the coming school year.
Recognizing the importance that basic education is not unduly crowded out, the government
will also review tertiary policies in coordination with development partners to ensure an
appropriate balance of spending between primary and tertiary education.
The government is committed to maintaining fiscal discipline and improving the quality
of spending. The authorities have committed to manage total expenditure in 2013, including

3
that authorized in the supplementary budget approved by Parliament in September, within the
overall spending envelope approved during the first review of the ECF and thus achieve a
balanced budget. The authorities are doing this through reallocating other spending and
utilizing under-spends in the first half of 2013 (including in the development budget).
The 2014 Budget recently passed by Parliament also targets a balanced cash budget, while
protecting spending on primary education and health.
Steps are well advanced to bring greater rigor to the management of Constituency
Development Funds. Implementing regulations that will give effect to the Constituency
Development Funds Act have been drafted by a bipartisan committee and are being consulted
widely. The regulations will introduce requirements on the management, use and reporting
of funds to deliver greater accountability and transparency.
A key priority for the coming months will be to bring the new PFMA into effect. The
authorities recognize that solid implementation is vital if the new fiscal framework is to truly
deliver responsible fiscal management and improved quality of spending over time. A
number of new program benchmarks have been established to begin to bring into effect the
new requirements under the Act, including new reporting, and updating of the financial
instructions.
Strengthening the debt management framework remains a priority. The authorities are
committed to a prudent approach to borrowing in line with the Debt Management Strategy.
With the completion of the Debt Management Strategy, the Government continues to put in
place a comprehensive debt management policy framework over the last 18 months. This
includes the endorsement by Cabinet of annual borrowing limits in line with the debt
sustainability analysis; completion of the State Owned Enterprises Debt Policy; the
incorporation of key aspects of the new Debt Management Strategy into the new Public
Financial Management Act 2013; the establishment and excellent running of the Debt
Management Advisory Committee; and the recent approval by Cabinet of the Guarantee and
On-Lending Policy, ahead of the new ECF benchmark.
Monetary Policy and Financial Sector
The authorities are committed to efforts to further deepen financial markets and
strengthen monetary policy instruments. In this context the Central Bank of Solomon
Islands (CBSI) will review all its monetary policy instruments and is continuing to deepen
the market for Bokolo bills through issuing additional maturities. The CBSI is alert to
inflationary risks in the light of stronger credit growth, and stands ready to take action if
needed to reduce liquidity.
Access to financial services remains of critical importance. The decision of the banks
currently operating in Solomon Islands to no longer provide banking services to logging

4
firms from 2014 – reflecting pressure from environmental groups in their home countries – is
a concern. Nevertheless, CBSI has responded to this cautiously in order to safeguard
financial stability. While two ‘interim’ banking licenses have now been issued (to a
Malaysian and a Sri Lankan bank), these entities are not permitted to carry out banking
operations until due diligence is complete and a full banking license has been issued.
Strengthening the financial supervisory and regulatory frameworks remains vital and
the authorities are continuing work to revise the National Provident Fund legislation; prepare
the Credit Unions Act; and to prepare a new Financial Institutions Act.
Structural Reforms
The authorities agree with staff on the need to develop new sources of growth – and
thus secure employment opportunities, government revenue and foreign exchange
earnings - given the long-term decline of the logging industry. Sectors that have been
identified as offering potential are agriculture, tourism, fisheries and mining, with new
fisheries and mining investments currently being explored.
Investment in critical infrastructure, particularly energy and transport, will remain
vital to secure improved growth prospects. The authorities are currently finalizing a new
medium-term development plan that will set out development goals for Solomon Islands and
priority actions to achieve these. Furthermore, the authorities are motivated to see the
functioning of the National Transport Fund (NTF) improved so that it can better support
transport infrastructure development in Solomon Islands.
Conclusion
The Solomon Island authorities would like to thank IMF staff for their constructive
engagement and valued technical assistance, including that provided from Headquarters and
the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC). This is playing an important
role supporting Solomon Islands to strengthen its economic resilience and growth prospects,
in order to deliver a higher standard of living for all Solomon Islanders.
