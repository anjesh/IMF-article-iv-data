STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 14, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Growth prospects and risks: Several conditions are in place in Germany for a domestic
demand-led recovery although the outlook is subject to considerable risks. The main risk
facing Germany is an intensification of the euro area crisis, which would spill over into
Germany through real and financial channels. Lower global growth prospects or a sharp
rise in oil prices also pose risks to the outlook.
Managing the transition to domestic demand-led growth: The fiscal stance is
appropriate under the baseline. The underlying strength of the labor market is expected
to underpin domestic demand-led growth. In this regard, a pick-up in wages and asset
prices should be seen as part of the natural process of private sector-led rebalancing.
Unfinished financial sector reform agenda: Continued progress on financial sector
reforms would help guard against shocks. In particular, it will be important to ensure that
risks from the global activities of the large German banks are fully understood and
internalized, which would require strengthening cross-border supervision and
cooperation. Greater efforts are also needed in restructuring the Landesbanken and
reforming their business models, strengthening the crisis management framework and
enhancing the deposit insurance regime. Steps to establish a framework for
implementing macroprudential policies are also timely, although there is no need to
tighten macroprudential policies at this juncture.
Germany’s role in an interconnected world: Articulating more clearly the Economic and
Monetary Union’s shared vision of the post-crisis architecture will help in restoring market
confidence. In addition, the positive short-run benefits of the implementation of ambitious
structural reform agendas in several euro area countries could be complemented with
pan-European actions, such as using EU structural funds more flexibly and increasing the
lending capacity of the European Investment Bank. Overall, Germany’s external position
remains substantially stronger than that implied by medium-term fundamentals and

global economic policy settings. With disinflationary pressures incipient in the periphery
economies over the medium term, and monetary conditions in Germany accommodative
from a cyclical perspective, inflation in Germany could be somewhat higher than the euro
area average, which would help narrow the competitiveness gap between the economies
at the core and in the periphery. Beyond this natural process, implementing policies to
encourage higher investment and increase potential growth through domestic sources
could play a role.
Reforms to raise potential growth and diversify its sources: Policies need to focus on
increasing the labor force, raising the quality of human capital, and raising the
productivity in the services sector. Efforts should also be stepped up to broaden the
sources of financing to encourage innovation and new engines of growth. Raising
potential growth and rebalancing its sources would also have beneficial spillovers to the
rest of the euro area.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

INTRODUCTION
1.

Despite facing considerable headwinds, the performance of the German economy

has been remarkable. Employment creation has been strong and unemployment has declined
to post-reunification lows, in the face of a very challenging external environment. The contraction
in activity in the last quarter of 2011 was followed by a sharp rebound in Germany early this year,
helping the euro area avoid a technical recession. Several conditions are now in place in Germany
for a domestic demand-led recovery. Underpinned by healthy corporate and household balance
sheets, higher wages, well anchored inflation expectations, and low borrowing costs, growth is
poised to reach potential in the second half of 2012.
2.

Policies need to guard against risks to the recovery. The main risk facing Germany is

an intensification of the euro area crisis, which would spill over into Germany through real and
financial channels. Lower global growth prospects more broadly or an abrupt rise in oil prices
due to geo-political shocks are also key downside risks to the outlook.
3.

Over the medium term, raising potential growth and its resilience need to be

viewed in a multilateral context. Germany is one of the world’s most open large economies,
making it susceptible to external developments in both the euro area and more broadly.
Germany can play a pivotal role in addressing the challenges faced by the euro area, in addition
to implementing its own structural reforms, to secure the region’s stability and raise its growth
potential.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. The Economic and Financial Context
4.

Economic growth appears to have bottomed out. Financial market turbulence and

weakening external demand led to a broad-based contraction of activity in Germany in the last
quarter of 2011, with the notable exception of construction. Activity picked up in the first quarter
of 2012, due to a rebound in external demand and strong consumption growth. Germany’s
cyclical position is more advanced than other large industrialized economies, and the output gap
is expected to close in 2012 (Figure 1).

5.

The labor market is exceptionally strong. Employment growth has been underpinned

by higher labor force participation and an increase in net migration, and unemployment at
5.3 percent is at a post-reunification low. Helped by the reforms implemented in the 2000s, the
labor market is trending towards a lower natural rate of unemployment, and since 2010, the
creation of jobs with full social security benefits has grown faster than atypical employment.
Reflecting the tighter conditions, wage growth has picked up. While nominal pay rates increased
by about 2 percent in 2011, the normalization of working hours and significant one-off payments
have pushed overall wage growth to near 3 percent (Figure 2).
6.

Fiscal consolidation is on track. The overall deficit narrowed to 1 percent of GDP last

year (from 4.3 percent in 2010), reflecting in part the phasing out of one-off financial sector
support measures. The structural balance improved by about 1¼ percent of GDP in 2011,
reflecting the withdrawal of stimulus and consolidation measures, including unwinding of
temporary tax and labor market measures, the removal of some exemptions, and reductions in
social spending and administrative costs. Overall, however, the financial crisis has led to an
increase in public debt from 65 percent of GDP in 2007 to 81 percent in 2011, including due to
financial sector support operations.

Higher inflation in recent quarters has mainly reflected the rise in energy prices.

Headline inflation has fallen to 2.2 percent in April
2012, in line with the moderation of fuel price
increases, while core inflation remained low at
1.4 percent (y/y, ex energy, food, alcohol, and
tobacco). Medium term price expectations remain
well anchored below 2 percent, as implied by the
break-even interest rate differential on 5-year Bunds
(Figure 1).

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Household and corporate balance sheets are healthy, and asset price developments

remain benign. Leverage in the household sector is low in comparison to other euro area
economies, and indeed has fallen recently. Meanwhile, corporate profitability is high and debtto-income ratios are lower than the euro area average. Equity prices in Germany have rebounded
broadly in line with international comparators, and reversed some of the losses of the second
half of 2011. Bond yields for banks and the public sector are at record lows, while yields for
corporate bonds have remained largely flat. Nationwide house prices have risen moderately
(1-4 percent in 2011) following years of stagnation, with stronger localized increases in some
areas, spurring construction activity.

B. Outlook and Risks—Domestic Demand-Led Growth but External Risks
Remain
Staff’s Views
10.

Several elements are in place for a private sector-led rebound. The recovery from the

2008/09 recession has already shown the resilience of consumption, underpinned by the strong
labor market. Strong growth in Q1 is also encouraging, but the genuine switch to a domestic-led
growth is yet to be seen. With rising household income and stable employment, strong balance
sheets among households and firms, and a supportive financing environment, both consumption
and investment, including residential investment, are expected to gather pace and propel growth
to around potential by the second half of 2012. For the year as a whole, activity is expected to
expand by 1 percent in 2012, and rise further to 1.4 percent in 2013 (Figure 1). Reflecting
Germany’s advanced cyclical position, net foreign demand is expected to contribute significantly
less to growth in 2012 and 2013 compared to previous years. With structural gains in
employment having largely run their course and demographic pressures taking hold, the pace of
employment creation is expected to fall to near zero over the medium term, and the decline in
the unemployment rate is expected to level off. In view of the loose monetary conditions for the
euro area as a whole, the economy is projected to operate at slightly above capacity in the
medium term. Consistent with these dynamics and a healthy growth in wages, headline inflation
is projected to settle slightly above 2 percent.

The downside risks to the near-term outlook are mainly external. The baseline

outlook is predicated on less volatile financial conditions and improving prospects for some of
Germany’s large trading partners. There are, however, numerous interrelated risks surrounding
this baseline:


The German economy is heavily exposed to an intensification of the euro area
crisis. Given its high trade and financial openness, together with still significant crossborder bank exposures (see Policy Theme #2, Figure 6, and Box 4), an escalation of
financial stress and further deterioration of confidence in the euro area periphery could
lead to a sharp downturn in Germany. Under such an adverse scenario, domestic banks
are likely to face higher funding costs and may incur trading losses; private demand
would be reduced due to tighter financing conditions and deteriorating consumer and
business confidence, while exports would suffer from weaker external demand.
Depending on the precise nature of the shock, an intensification of the crisis could also
lead to more abrupt deleveraging by the banks, and unlike in the baseline, this may
involve a sharp cutback of banks’ lending domestically.



Broader downside risks relate to a slowdown in global growth or a sharp rise in oil
prices. Given Germany’s direct trade linkages, particularly with the United States and
Asia, an unanticipated slowdown in activity would directly lower the demand for
Germany’s exports, in addition to the indirect linkages through other euro area trading
partners. A sharp rise in oil prices due to geo-political factors would depress aggregate
demand and put upward pressures on prices. More medium-term risks relate to a
slowdown in potential growth if progress on structural policies proves insufficient. Lower
growth would also have negative consequences for public debt, which is highly sensitive

to growth dynamics. The risk that accommodative monetary conditions lead to a
mispricing of assets is seen as low at the current juncture.

The Authorities’ Views
12.

The authorities broadly agreed with the staff’s baseline. They concurred with staff

that conditions for a rebalancing of the economy towards domestic demand are in place, noting
the strong performance of the labor market and sustained gains in real disposable income. The
authorities were of the view that over the medium term, the net contribution of foreign demand
to growth could approach zero. The authorities also shared staff’s view that anticipated wage and
price increases are part of the rebalancing of the German economy, and could help the euro area
more broadly.
13.

The authorities assessed the downside risks somewhat differently and noted some

upside potential. They saw the identified risks as being of low probability, but rightly noted that
several of them are interrelated and could materialize at the same time. They also noted another
medium term risk stemming from insufficiently ambitious policies in the euro area, should they
lead to contingent pressures on Germany’s public finances or delayed progress on the needed
restructuring of financial sectors in the euro area. On the upside, the authorities noted that
growth may turn out to be higher as uncertainty recedes more quickly than anticipated and
factors such as higher migration raise the economy’s growth potential.

requirements of the pan-European Fiscal Compact, since the German structural fiscal deficit is
expected to fall below 0.5 percent of GDP already in 2013.
15.

Despite ample liquidity, credit growth remains moderate. Bank balances with the

Bundesbank are high, and lending rates are lower than elsewhere in Europe. German banks have
also used LTRO funds both in December and February though the uptake was rather small
despite the large number of participating banks. Nevertheless, the rise in bank lending is
moderate, reflecting still low demand from households and firms.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

16.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

The strength of German banks has improved but vulnerabilities remain. German

banks are generally meeting the minimum levels of required regulatory capital and have ample
liquidity. However, some remain highly leveraged and dependent on wholesale funding, have low
capital quality and profitability (Figure 5), and some institutions are significantly exposed to the
euro area periphery. Six larger banks were called upon to strengthen their capital position as a
result of the latest European Banking Authority’s (EBA’s) stress test, and are well on their way to
meet EBA requirements (one bank is in the process of being wound down). Some large
international financial institutions also have substantial cross-border operations, and significant
counterparty risk exposures related to their large derivative portfolios. As banks seek to
deleverage, they are focusing on reducing exposures outside their core business lines and
regions, generating outward spillovers. German banks have made some progress on raising core
capital in line with Basel III, and in meeting the new liquidity and leverage ratios.
17.

As a backstop, the financial stability support mechanism (SoFFin II) was

reintroduced on a preemptive basis with an overall amount of €480 billion available
through end-2012. Outstanding balances of public financial support to banks under the original
Special Fund for Financial Market Stabilization (SoFFin I) continue to decline. Capital support to
banks has been reduced by about one third, and few liquidity guarantees remain outstanding.
The size of the portfolios of the two winding-up institutions remains high at just under
10 percent of GDP and a further increase is anticipated by mid-year with the transfer of a residual
portfolio of non-core assets as part of the restructuring of a large Landesbank. As of end-2011,
operational losses of SoFFin I are estimated at €22.1 billion, approximately half of it linked to the
restructuring of Greek sovereign bonds.
18.

The institutional framework for macroprudential policies is evolving. Building on

initial recommendations set out in the authorities’ 10-point plan, which envisaged a stronger role
for the Bundesbank in macroprudential
supervision, a recent legislative initiative

been defined yet, and discussions are ongoing at the European level, measures such as
prescribing effective loan-to-value ratios for mortgages and adjusting capital buffers (e.g.,
countercyclical capital buffer, systemic risk buffer) are under consideration.
Staff’s Views
19.

The formally limited fiscal room should be deployed carefully under the baseline.

Within the constitutionally binding fiscal rule, the available fiscal room in 2012 is estimated at
around ½ percent of GDP, unless the escape clause is invoked under exceptional circumstances.
Fiscal spillovers from Germany would contribute only a small amount to real GDP growth in the
rest of the euro area, concentrated in small and open neighboring countries (the Czech Republic,
Austria, the Netherlands and Belgium) with limited impact on the euro area periphery economies
(Box 1). Even in the absence of the fiscal rule, the benefits to the euro area periphery of a greater
fiscal expansion in Germany would be limited. Moreover, Germany’s status as a guarantor of the
EFSF/ESM and potentially large contingent liabilities associated with the resolution of the euro
area crisis, and medium-term concerns about aging pressures, also weigh on the room for shortterm stimulus. In light of these considerations, and with the virtually closed output gap under the
baseline, a deviation of fiscal policy from the 2012 budget is not called for, although automatic
stabilizers should be allowed to operate fully. Any available fiscal resources could, instead, be
used to facilitate reforms in the euro area periphery, including through increasing the lending
capacity of the European Investment Bank, and enhanced and better targeted EU structural
funds. This could help stabilize the external environment facing Germany over the medium term
and facilitate reforms in the periphery economies.

Box 1. Fiscal Spillovers1
Fiscal stimulus in Germany is likely to have a relatively small impact on the rest of the euro area.
The results presented in Figure 1 are based on three alternative approaches described in Ivanova and
Weber (2011), Vitek (2012) and the GIMF model described in Kumhof et. al. (2010). These simulations
suggest the maximum impact of a two-year 1 percent of GDP fiscal stimulus in Germany on the rest of
the euro area at 0.2 percentage points if all the stimulus is concentrated in public investment and
accommodated by monetary policy. In contrast, the impact on German domestic GDP can be
potentially quite large ranging between 0.7 and 0.9 percent of GDP on average over two years, if
stimulus is concentrated in public consumption and investment.

Fiscal spillovers from Germany are concentrated in small and open neighboring countries while
the impact on the euro area periphery is limited. Economies with whom Germany has strong trade
links, such as the Czech Republic, Austria, the Netherlands and Belgium are estimated to benefit most
from a German fiscal stimulus. In contrast, the impact on real GDP in Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and
Spain is estimated not to exceed 0.15 percent with a particularly small impact on Greece given the
offsetting monetary tightening that a procyclical fiscal loosening in Germany would entail. The
relatively small fiscal spillovers to the euro area periphery in Ivanova and Weber (2011) can be
explained by the relatively weak trade links with those countries that are relatively small compared to
Germany (Greece, Portugal) while the countries with relatively stronger trade links (Italy and Spain) are
also the ones that are closer to Germany in economic size. Spillovers can thus be expected to be small
as only a portion of fiscal stimulus in Germany is transferred to these countries. Ireland is relatively
small and has relatively strong trade links with Germany, implying larger spillovers.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Only in the event of a renewed downturn would more active fiscal policies be

needed. Under such circumstances, and depending on the size and nature of the shock to the
economy, invoking the escape clause under the fiscal rule could be appropriate to support
activity and employment in Germany and help stabilize the euro area. To be timely and effective,
a contingency plan should be developed, prioritizing revenue and expenditure measures with the
highest payoff that could be quickly implemented. In the event of a negative shock, priority
should be given to measures that could also spur long-term potential growth, including
reduction in labor and corporate income taxes, and reorientation of social spending towards
education and childcare support. The labor market could be supported through an expanded
short work scheme.
21.

Ensuring financial stability remains a key priority. In particular, it will be important to

ensure that risks from the global activities of the large German banks are fully understood and
internalized. In this regard, strengthening cross-border supervision and cooperation will be
important. Some institutions, including the Landesbanken, remain vulnerable to increases in
wholesale funding costs. The pre-emptive reactivation of the financial stability support
mechanism (SoFFin II) is welcome as a backstop to limit the impact of deleveraging on the
domestic economy and in other countries where banks retain significant exposures, and to
ensure the system’s stability, if downside risks materialize. The banks identified as having a
capital shortfall are expected to comply with EBA requirements without resorting to Soffin II.
Looking ahead, meeting Basel III requirements will create further pressure on banks to
strengthen their balance sheets.
22.

Some progress has been made on the implementation of the 2011 FSAP Update

recommendations, but much work remains (text table). The current favorable
macroeconomic conditions provide an opportunity to accelerate reforms. Among the key
priorities, overall momentum in the reform of the Landesbanken needs to be stepped up, the
crisis management framework should be strengthened by establishing resolution plans, and the
challenges inherent in the fragmented deposit insurance regime should be addressed.
23.

Macroprudential policy frameworks should be put in place, but policies should not

be tightened at this juncture. Establishing a financial stability committee is a welcome step, and
its independence from potential political influence should be ensured in line with the
recommendations by the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). There is however no need to
tighten macroprudential policies at the current juncture, and the near-term priority is to support
the rebound of domestic demand accompanied by a natural relative price adjustment process.

Main Outstanding 2011 FSAP Update Recommendations
Recommendation
Status
Continue to improve stress testing in the banking
and insurance sectors. Rigorously ensure that any
institution that displays weaknesses on a forward
looking basis strengthens its balance sheet and
takes managerial action.
Grant supervisors power to vet in advance bank
acquisitions of subsidiaries.
Define the role of the Bundesbank as
macroprudential supervisor, and institute free
exchange of information between macro and
microprudential supervisors.
Continue to strengthen on-site supervision.

Review reporting requirements to ensure timely
and systemic information is available on emerging
risk factors.
Institute a harmonized and legally binding deposit
guarantee of €100,000, backed by adequate
prefunding.

Ensure the financial strength of the new bank
restructuring fund, and clarify the interaction
between the restructuring fund and the various
deposit guarantee and mutual protection
schemes.

Further stress testing improvements have been
made to ensure forward-looking monitoring of
institutions’ balance sheet strength, and BaFin was
calling for corrective action when weaknesses
were found.
Legislative initiatives on this matter are not
expected in the near term.
The adoption of legislative proposals for the
establishment of a Financial Stability Commission
(FSC) is expected by end year, including
clarification of the roles and responsibilities of
institutions and rules on information sharing.
Important progress has been made on reducing
securities market supervision over-dependence on
external auditors, but the banking supervisor does
not anticipate changes in this area.
Proposals to strengthen reporting requirements
are being developed, with implementation
expected in 2013.
For the mutual protection schemes, establishing a
legally binding deposit guarantee of €100,000 in
addition to mutual protection arrangements is
being considered. However, no concrete action is
expected before the conclusion of the discussions
at European level, including on ex ante funding
levels. Complementing the statutory coverage of
€100,000, the coverage level under the
commercial banks’ private deposit protection
scheme remains high despite a reduction over
time from currently 30 percent of a bank’s capital
per depositor to 8.75 percent in 2025.
Contributions to the restructuring fund in 2011
were at the lower end of expectations, and are
forecast to be even less this year, while
contingency arrangements remain in place. The
interaction between the restructuring fund and
the various deposit protection and mutual
protection schemes is expected to be dealt with
on a case-by-case basis.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

The reform of the Landesbanken is proceeding
only in a gradual manner. The restructuring of a
large Landesbank is expected to be completed by
mid-year. There are no plans to loosen regional
constraints on local banks, open up the public
banks to private participation, and reduce
noncommercial influences.

The Authorities’ Views
24.

The authorities see continued fiscal consolidation in Germany as a key credibility

anchor in Europe. They do not see any need or space for fiscal relaxation in Germany given
favorable macroeconomic developments, small potential spillovers to the southern euro area
periphery, and the constraints of the fiscal rule. The authorities also pointed out the potentially
negative implications in the periphery economies if the ECB were to tighten monetary policy in
response to fiscal relaxation in Germany given its cyclical position. They also saw the role of
Germany as a fiscal anchor in the euro area as a strong motivation for delivering on their fiscal
commitments. The authorities do not see the immediate need to have a contingency plan for a
fiscal stimulus, and view the experience with the stimulus during the past crisis, which relied to
some extent on capital expenditure, as a mixed success.
25.

The authorities were in broad agreement with the staff’s assessment of the

financial system. They agreed that strengthening cross-border regulation and supervision will
be important. They see the banks well on their way towards Basel III implementation and see EBA
capital requirements as within close reach, but agreed that more progress on financial sector
reforms is needed. The authorities share the staff’s view on the importance of stress testing and
the need for forward-looking monitoring of banks’ balance sheet strength, and recognize the
merits of strengthening reporting requirements. Concerning initiatives to vet in advance bank
acquisitions of subsidiaries, the authorities expressed some reservations on potential interference
with bank business interests. Further reforms of the business models of the Landesbanken were
deemed useful but challenging given the need to attain consensus at the sub-national level.
26.

The authorities agreed with the recommendation to establish a macroprudential

policy framework, and shared the view that there is no need to tighten macroprudential

policies at the current juncture. The authorities expect to move forward quickly with the
establishment of the FSC, well within the timetable set by the ESRB for mid-2013. The authorities
envisage coordinating macro-prudential instruments consistent with European Union initiatives.

B. Policy Theme #2: Securing Higher and Stable Growth in an
Interconnected World
Germany in an Interconnected World
27.

Background. Germany has close links with the euro area through the common currency,

which facilitated trade and closer financial integration, and as a regional safe haven (Box 2). More
broadly, trade as a share of German GDP has risen from 62 percent in 2000 to 94 percent by
2011, in part reflecting in particular burgeoning Eastern European supply chains and higher
exports to Emerging Asia. Financial linkages are also extensive, including through the crossborder activities of German banks and exposures to the Eurosystem (Target 2) of about
24 percent of GDP as of end-April 2012.
Staff’s Views
28.

The German economy is sensitive to macroeconomic and financial market

developments in the rest of the world. Due to its high and rising trade and financial openness,
business cycle dynamics in Germany are driven in large part by foreign shocks (see Box 3 and
Vitek 2012). Trade linkages with the United States, United Kingdom and emerging Asia are
particularly important in transmitting macroeconomic shocks. Trade linkages within the euro area
are significant, but the transmission of shocks through this channel is mitigated somewhat by
monetary policy stabilization within the currency union. Regarding financial shocks, the United
States, United Kingdom and Japan are important from a portfolio channel, while banking sector
linkages and related flows are important within the euro area and with the United States and the
United Kingdom.

Box 2. Balance of Payment Linkages to Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain
Germany’s current account surplus with select
economies—Greece, Italy, Portugal, and
Spain—has fallen back to levels observed
before the boom period of 2005–07. Following
the demand adjustment in these economies, their
deficits with Germany fell by about half from its
peak in 2008 back to levels observed in 2004.
Given the demand driven nature of the boom and
subsequent adjustment, exports from Germany to
these economies fell during the adjustment, while
imports to Germany from these countries barely
changed.

The financial account has had more significant swings. While the current account remains in surplus
with most of the peripheral countries (except Ireland), the variation in the financial account between
Germany and the economies under stress has been three times larger than the current account
variation and has changed signs. Moreover, there is almost no correlation between these two balances.
Bilateral trade in goods and services has only a limited influence on bilateral cross-border financial
flows.
For much of the last decade, net private capital flows from Germany to these economies were—
on average—lower than the current account balances. Financing by Germany in excess of its current
account surplus vis-à-vis these economies was limited to short periods of time. From the perspective of
Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, current account transactions with Germany since 2003
represent about ¼ of their combined current account deficit. Net financial private inflows from
Germany financed about one fifth of the current account deficit over the same period.1 The change in
the direction of private capital flows is primarily driven by German residents.

Box 3. Spillovers Through Cyclical Fluctuations
Empirical analysis that takes into account trade linkages as well as international money, bond and equity
market linkages (Vitek 2012) suggests that the German economy is sensitive to macroeconomic and financial
market developments in the rest of the world (inward spillovers).1 For example, financial shocks in the

United States which increase its output gap by one percent are estimated to raise the output gap in
Germany by 0.52 percent. It also suggests that Germany is an efficient transmitter of business cycle
fluctuations to its regional supply chain, but has not been a major originator of such shocks (outward
spillovers). Within the euro area, outward spillovers are mitigated by monetary policy responses,
explaining the small effects on countries such as France and Spain. The empirical analysis, however, does

not account for trend growth in demand and, hence, the potential benefits from a permanent increase in
potential growth.

exposures of German banks through their overseas operations (Box 4) also generate outward
spillovers to economies in Europe and beyond.
30.

Germany’s traditional current account surplus increased substantially in the mid-

2000s, peaking at 7½ percent of GDP in 2007 (Figure 6). This reflected a rise in exports,
particularly to economies outside the euro area, which was only offset partly by higher imports
from these economies. The rise in external surpluses translated into a steady improvement in
Germany’s net international investment position (IIP) to a positive 35 percent of GDP at end2011, from near-balance a decade ago. About ½ of the net IIP position at end-2011 reflected net
claims on the Eurosystem.
31.

The increase in the external surplus was largely driven by the corporate sector

(Figure 6). Corporate savings increased significantly by the mid-2000s, on the back of strong
profits (Figure 7). While profitability was helped by wage increases which fell short of productivity
growth over a sustained period, there were various factors that encouraged the strengthening of
corporate balance sheets. These included changes to the tax regime, changes to the close
relationship between corporates and banks, regulatory changes (Basel II), and the increased
globalization of production which required access to international bank financing. The effects of
regulatory changes and the impact of globalization were likely more pronounced for German
corporates due to their heavy reliance on bank-based financing. In contrast to savings,
investment was slow to respond. Almost a whole decade of disappointingly low growth,
unfavorable demographic trends, and interest rate developments vis-à-vis many European

German monetary financial institutions and about 4½ times their total capital. More than ¾ of total

In 2011 total exposures to Europe declined substantially while those to the US have edged up.
Exposures decreased substantially in Spain, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Greece, Norway, Denmark, Belgium,

The potential for further outward spillovers from bank deleveraging in Europe remains. Total
exposures to advanced European countries remain large (15 percent of total assets of German banks
and over 250 percent of their total capital). Looking forward, German banks will likely continue

Overall, Germany’s external position remains substantially stronger than that

implied by medium-term fundamentals and global economic policy settings. In part, this
reflects the lack of an exchange rate adjustment mechanism within the currency union and
developments in other euro area countries. Staff estimates suggest that Germany’s real effective
exchange rate is undervalued by 0-10 percent. Looking ahead, part of the adjustment will
therefore reflect policy changes elsewhere—including reigning in large fiscal deficits in some
large advanced economies as well as fiscal and structural adjustments in the euro area periphery.
The rebalancing of domestic sources of growth that is expected to occur to a large extent
naturally as a reflection of tighter labor markets, high liquidity, and low interest rates, will also
help by boosting domestic demand and reduce the current account balance to around 4 percent
of GDP in the medium term. With disinflationary pressures incipient in the periphery economies
over the medium term, and monetary conditions in Germany accommodative from a cyclical
perspective, inflation in Germany could be somewhat higher than the euro area average, which
would help narrow the competitiveness gap between the economies at the core and in the
periphery. Beyond the natural process, implementing policies to encourage higher investment
and increase potential growth through domestic sources (discussed below) could play a role.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

GERMANY

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Staff sees an additional reduction in the current account balance by 2 percent of GDP over and
above the natural rebalancing process as appropriate.1
33.

Germany can play a pivotal role in supporting the adjustment process in the euro

area and helping restore market confidence. Articulating more clearly the European Union’s
shared vision of the post-crisis architecture of the union would help in durably restoring market
confidence by providing an anchor to medium-term market expectations. A key element of this
post-crisis Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) architecture is common understanding on
greater financial and fiscal integration (see forthcoming 2012 Euro Area Article IV staff report).
While the natural rebalancing process in Germany will help, efforts on structural reforms in the
periphery could be reinforced through pan-European actions. These could include boosting and
better targeting EU structural funds and increasing the lending capacity of the European
Investment Bank.
The Authorities’ Views
34.

The authorities noted that while the German current account surplus may not be

fully explained by fundamentals in models, this does not imply the conclusion that the
current account position is stronger than implied by fundamentals. They noted that the
price competitiveness of the German economy is currently quite favorable, but saw the elements
for rebalancing in Germany as largely in place. They agreed that some policy levers to raise
potential growth could be beneficial. They agreed that monetary policy settings appropriate for
the EMU may imply somewhat higher inflation in Germany, and this is consistent with the natural
adjustment process.
35.

While agreeing with Germany’s importance in the EMU, the authorities offered

some nuances regarding pan-European actions. While acknowledging some of the
shortcomings of the current institutional design of the EMU, they believed that rigorous
adherence to reform plans underway in the crisis economies is key to restoring market
confidence, and that patience is needed in seeing the payoff from reforms. They were of the view
that discussions on redesigning the architecture of the EMU would be premature before a solid
track record had been established on policy implementation and its beneficial outcomes. Overall,
they stressed their commitment to more rather than less integration in Europe, and saw ample
space to improve the quality of spending of common pools of resources.

Background. Germany’s potential growth at around 1¼ percent is low and has been

highly dependent on external sources of demand. Moreover, with the aging of the population,
the shrinking of the labor force would adversely affect potential growth over the longer term. In
addition, productivity growth in the services sector unrelated to manufacturing, which provides
some 60 percent of private employment and about 70 percent of value added, was about a
quarter of that in goods production during 2000-07. Investment has also lagged and has
contributed to external imbalances despite healthy corporate balance sheet positions.

Policies to increase labor force participation, investment, and productivity growth,

especially in areas outside Germany’s traditional strengths, need to be stepped up. As
discussed in detail in the 2011 Article IV consultation report, tax reform priorities include
reduction of labor taxes at the participation margin and further improvements in the corporate
tax regime, including the possible introduction of in-work and earned income tax credit
programs and a reform of the regime of income splitting, reforms of the local level trade tax and
the introduction of an allowance for the normal return on new equity.2
38.

Reforming the financial sector will be an essential complement to raise the

economy’s growth potential and increase its resilience. Broadening the channels of financial
intermediation would facilitate the allocation of resources towards innovation and new engines
of growth. This would require a greater development of intermediation outside traditional

banking channels, using so-called arms-length finance. Changes to regulation and supervision
would have to keep pace with the development of a more arms-length system in order to ensure
financial stability. In addition, ambiguities in the tax treatment of venture capital firms should be
addressed and consideration should be given to the reduction of differences in the tax treatment
of venture capital firms with other European countries. The regulatory framework may also need
to be reexamined with a view to encouraging a larger investor base for risk capital. The
intellectual property held by universities and research institutions needs to be deployed in
industry more easily. Recent reform initiatives in the area of corporate and personal insolvency
are welcome, and in addition it may be useful to explore the feasibility of out-of-court
restructuring procedures to reduce the stigma associated with business failure. Strengthening
the resilience of the financial system will also be important, and will also require efforts to reduce
outstanding capital support to banks and the sizeable balance sheets of the two winding-up
institutions, while seeking to minimize potential losses to the state.

The Authorities’ View
39.

The authorities agreed with the need to continue structural reforms to raise potential

growth. They noted the need for further progress on raising labor force participation, particularly
for women, improving education infrastructure and improving competition in services, while
underscoring that these need to be undertaken while adhering to broader fiscal objectives. The
authorities also expressed interest in the staff’s recommendation on developing arm’s length
financial systems in Germany and were in broad agreement with the recommendation on
improving conditions for venture capital financing.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

STAFF APPRAISAL
40.

Several conditions are in place in Germany for a domestic demand-led recovery

following the downturn at end-2011. The drag from last year’s decline in external demand is
receding, while domestic labor market conditions have continued to strengthen. Underpinned
by healthy corporate and household balance sheets, higher wages, well anchored inflation
expectations, and low borrowing costs, growth is poised to reach potential in the second half of
2012.
41.

The near-term outlook is, however, clouded by a number of downside risks

from external sources. The main risk facing Germany is an intensification of the euro area crisis,
which would spill over into Germany directly through real and financial channels, and indirectly
through dampened business and consumer sentiment. Lower global growth prospects more
broadly would also cloud the outlook for activity. An abrupt rise in oil prices due to geo-political
shocks also remains a downside risk to the outlook.
42.

The main policy priority in the near term is to manage the transition to

domestic demand-led growth and guard against the downside risks. The fiscal stance, with
a modest structural consolidation and the full operation of automatic stabilizers, is appropriate
under the baseline, given Germany’s advanced cyclical position, limited fiscal spillovers on
growth in the euro area periphery, and Germany’s status as an EFSF/ESM guarantor. Looking
ahead, a pickup in wages and some asset prices would be part of the natural process of
rebalancing the sources of growth. Allowing these developments to proceed, while adhering to
Germany’s macroeconomic policy framework, will also help to appropriately further reduce
Germany’s high current account surplus.
43.

Securing financial stability in the face of external risks remains a key priority.

Despite some gradual progress achieved, the banking system remains vulnerable to external
shocks given its high leverage ratios, the low quality of bank capital, significant cross-border
exposures, and large reliance on wholesale funding. It will also be important to ensure that risks
from the global activities of large banks are fully understood and internalized. The pre-emptive
reactivation of the backstop facility for financial institutions (SoFFin II) is welcome, even though
banks are expected to meet EBA capital requirements without the use of public support, under
the baseline. Steps to establish a framework for implementing macroprudential policies
following European Union initiatives are timely, although there is no need to tighten
macroprudential policies at this juncture.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

The current environment provides a window of opportunity to build

momentum in financial sector reforms in line with the 2011 Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP) Update recommendations. Efforts to reduce outstanding public capital
support to some banks and the sizable balance sheets of the two winding-up institutions should
be stepped up, while paying due regard to minimizing potential losses to the state. Progress is
also needed on a comprehensive strategy aimed at improving the efficiency and stability of the
banking system. In particular, greater efforts are needed in restructuring the Landesbanken and
reforming their business models. In addition, the crisis management framework should be
strengthened by establishing resolution plans and enhancing the deposit insurance regime.
45.

As the euro area’s largest economy, Germany can play a pivotal role in

addressing the challenges posed by the crisis. Articulating more clearly the Economic and
Monetary Union’s shared vision of an appropriate post-crisis architecture will help in restoring
market confidence. The positive short-run benefits of the implementation of ambitious structural
reform agendas in several euro area countries should be complemented with pan-European
measures. These could include using EU structural funds and increasing the lending capacity of
the European Investment Bank. Moreover, the reduction of imbalances in the euro area would
be helped by the natural rebalancing of Germany’s economy. In this context, consistent with the
mandate of the European Central Bank, disinflationary pressures incipient in the periphery
economies, essential for their relative price realignment, could imply inflation in Germany that is
somewhat higher than the euro area average for some time.
46.

Germany should seize the opportunity to undertake its own structural reforms

to raise potential growth and diversify its sources, reinforcing reform momentum in the
euro area. Higher domestically driven growth would help raise the economy’s potential above
that envisaged under the baseline while generating positive outward spillovers. Ongoing efforts
to increase the labor force through the higher participation of female and older workers and the
migration of skilled workers are welcome. Raising the quality of human capital will require
reforms to the system of education and training. Raising productivity in the services sector
would be helped by greater competition, including at the regional level in network industries
such as transportation and energy.
47.

There is a need to broaden the access to risk capital through structural financial

reforms. Efforts should be stepped up to develop more arms-length financial intermediation as
a complement to the well-established relationship-based system in Germany. Recent reform
initiatives in the area of corporate and personal insolvency are welcome. The policy framework
needs to be reexamined with a view to encouraging a larger investor base for risk capital.

Table 7. Germany: Risk Assessment Matrix1
(Scale―high, medium, or low)

Source of Risks
1. Strong intensification of
the euro area crisis

2. Slowdown of world growth

Relative Likelihood
Medium

High

Heightened financial stress could
adversely alter the outlook for the
euro area.

Direct effects through lower export
demand and inward financial spillovers,
indirect effects through deleveraging and
uncertainty.

Medium

High

Slowing demand from emerging
Asia and the U.S.
3. Slowdown of potential
growth

4. Sharp increase in oil prices

Medium
Strategies to counteract
demographic pressures and
increase productivity may fail to
deliver results.
Medium
Geo-political risks could lead to a
sharp increase in oil prices.

5. Mispricing of assets

Low
Loose liquidity conditions in the
banking sector may lead to
excessive asset price increases

6. More acute deleveraging
by the German banking
system

1

Impact if Realized

Lower export demand could hurt
Germany’s export performance.
Medium
Potential growth would decline in the
medium term.

Medium
Higher energy prices could depress
demand and raise inflation.
Medium
Subsequent price corrections could be
costly.

Low

Low

Write-downs could be higher than
expected, and meeting capital
requirements could be challenging.

Deleveraging could force banks to reduce
domestic lending, with negative effects on
activity.

The RAM shows events that could materially alter the baseline path - the scenario most likely to materialize in the view

of the staff.

Table 8. Authorities’ Response to Past IMF Policy Recommendations
(Scale―fully consistent, broadly consistent, or marginally consistent)

IMF 2011 Article IV Recommendations
Fiscal policy
The fiscal consolidation path is appropriate.

Financial sector policy I
Address the legacy of the financial crisis by
stepping up the resolution of the winding-up
institutions and reduce vulnerabilities
Financial sector policy II
Consolidate Landesbanken and revisit their
business model, clarify the regulatory and
supervisory regime, and gradually shift the
ownership the Sparkassen away from the public
sector, while carving out their public functions.

Structural reforms
To raise potential growth, increase labor force
participation, including through tax policy
measures, facilitate conditions for investment,
including through tax reform and reform the
education system. Enhance the provision of risk
capital and provide for a more efficient
insolvency process.

Authorities’ Response
Fully consistent
The 2011 outturn was better than projected
due to favorable macro developments; no new
consolidation measures were taken.
Broadly consistent
Banks are strengthening their capital buffers,
but progress in the winding-up institutions is
slow.
Marginally consistent
Consolidation efforts in the Landesbanken
sector are slow. The proposed Financial Stability
Committee will help clarifying the regulatory
and supervisory roles for macroprudential
oversight.

Broadly consistent
Measures to increase the labor force have been
taken, and reforms of the education system are
underway in the Länder; there are reform
initiatives for the insolvency process.

Exchange Rate Arrangement

Germany’s currency is the euro, which floats freely and independently against other currencies.
Germany is an Article VIII member and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on
payments and transfers for current international transactions. It maintains measures adopted for
security reasons, which have been notified to the Fund for approval in accordance with the
procedures of Decision 144 and does so solely for the preservation of national or international
security.
VIII.

Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT)

An assessment under the international standard for AML/CFT was conducted by the Fund's Legal
Department in May 2009. The detailed assessment report was adopted by the joint MENAFATFFATF Plenary Meeting held in Abu Dhabi from February 17-19, 2010. The report concluded that,
despite Germany introducing a number of measures in recent years to strengthen its AML/CFT
regime, the AML/CFT framework is not fully in line with the standard. The report identified
weaknesses in the legal framework and in sanctioning for non-compliance with AML/CFT
requirements. The authorities have amended some laws and regulations to address some of the
deficiencies, but it is too early to know whether practical implementation of some measures has
improved. The areas where action is still required to demonstrate that deficiencies have been
addressed include:

amending the Criminal Code to criminalize TF in a way fully consistent with international
standards;

ensuring that entities report transactions when an institution suspects or has reasonable
ground to suspect that a transaction involves the proceeds of crime;

ensuring that the FIU carries out more robust analysis of Suspicious Transaction Reports
(STRs);

fully and effectively implementing the UN Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs) on TF;

applying sanctioning powers more effectively for breaches of AML/CFT obligations;

strengthening the effective implementation of AML/CFT obligations imposed on
designated non-financial businesses and professions (DNFBPs); and

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

ANNEX II: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. Germany has a full range of statistical publications
and subscribes to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). A ROSC Data Module
report was published in January 2006. The authorities make substantial use of the Internet to
facilitate on-line access to data and press information.
Germany adopted the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts 1995 (ESA95) in 1999.
The 2005 ROSC Data Module mission found that the macroeconomic statistics generally follow
internationally accepted standards and guidelines on concepts and definitions, scope,
classification and sectorization, and basis for recording. However, the sources for estimating
value added for a few categories of service industries could be improved. A direct source for
quarterly changes in inventories, which is an important indicator of changes in GDP over the
business cycle, is lacking. There is no systematic, proactive process to monitor the ongoing
representativeness of the samples of local units and products between rebases of the producer
price index.
Comprehensive data reporting systems support the accuracy and reliability of the government
finance and balance of payments statistics. However, although explanatory documentation exists,
differences between the general government data in the ESA95 classification and the general
government cash data on an administrative basis is impairing fiscal analysis; Germany
publishes—through Eurostat—general government revenue, expenditure, and balance on an
accrual basis on a quarterly basis (ESA95) and submits annual data for publication in the
Government Financial Statistics Yearbook, in GFSM 2001 format. Monthly data are only
disseminated on a cash-basis.
Germany is participating in the Coordinated Compilation Exercise for financial soundness
indicators (FSIs). In 2006, as part of this exercise, the German authorities compiled a
comprehensive set of FSI data and metadata. There are, however, substantial lags in the
publication of some of the financial soundness indicators. In addition, the quality of data on bank
exposures submitted to the BIS needs to be improved, including provision of the data on
ultimate risk basis for advanced countries.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Germany
On June 29, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Germany.1
Background
The German economy’s performance has been remarkable despite facing considerable
headwinds. Financial market turbulence and weakening external demand led to a broad-based
contraction of activity in Germany in the last quarter of 2011, with the notable exception of
construction. However, economic growth appears to have bottomed out and activity picked up in
the first quarter of 2012 fueled by a rebound in external demand and strong consumption
growth.
Several conditions are now in place in Germany for a domestic demand-led recovery.
Employment creation has been robust and unemployment at 5.3 percent is at a postreunification low. Helped by the reforms implemented in the 2000s, the labor market is trending
towards a lower natural rate of unemployment, and since 2010, the creation of jobs with full
social security benefits has grown faster than atypical employment. Reflecting the tighter
conditions, wage growth has picked up. While nominal pay rates increased by about 2 percent
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
in 2011, the normalization of working hours and significant one-off payments have pushed
overall wage growth to near 3 percent. Bond yields for banks and the public sector are at record
lows, while yields for corporate bonds have remained largely flat. Bank lending rates are lower
than elsewhere in Europe, but the rise in bank lending is moderate, reflecting still low demand
from households and firms. Headline inflation has fallen to 2.2 percent in April 2012, in line with
the moderation of fuel price increases, while core inflation remained low at 1.4 percent.
Medium-term price expectations remain well anchored below 2 percent.
Germany’s current account surplus remained large at 5 ¾ percent of GDP in 2011, in part
reflecting a relatively comfortable competitiveness position. At the same time, private capital
outflows have reversed their course as German banks have withdrawn from Europe’s cross
border interbank market and investment positions in economies under stress are being
unwound. The net private inflows into Germany are reflected in an increase in the
Bundesbank’s claims on the Eurosystem, which had risen to €644 billion by April (approximately
24 percent of GDP). With strong demand for safe assets, German government bond yields have
declined to record lows.
The strength of German banks has improved but vulnerabilities remain. While German banks
are generally meeting the minimum levels of required regulatory capital and have ample
liquidity, they remain highly leveraged, dependent on wholesale funding, have low capital quality
and profitability, and some institutions are significantly exposed to the euro area periphery.
Some large international financial institutions have substantial cross-border operations, and
significant counterparty risk exposures related to their large derivative portfolios. Six larger
banks that were called upon to strengthen their capital position as a result of the latest
European Banking Authority’s (EBA’s) stress test are well on their way to meet EBA
requirements (with one bank in the process of being wound down). The authorities have
reintroduced the financial stability support mechanism (SoFFin II) on a preemptive basis with an
overall amount of €480 billion available through end-2012.
Fiscal consolidation is on track. The overall deficit narrowed to 1 percent of GDP in 2011 (from
4.3 percent in 2010), reflecting in part the phasing out of one-off financial sector support
measures. The structural balance improved by about 1¼ percent of GDP in 2011, reflecting the
withdrawal of stimulus and consolidation measures, including unwinding of temporary tax and
labor market measures, the removal of some exemptions, and reductions in social spending
and administrative costs. Overall, however, the financial crisis has led to an increase in public
debt from 65 percent of GDP in 2007 to 81 percent in 2011, including due to financial sector
support operations.

3
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Germany’s strong macroeconomic management, which has
resulted in a favorable economic performance despite the uncertain external environment. They
noted, however, that the near-term outlook is clouded by downside risks, including a strong
intensification of the euro-area crisis and potentially lower global growth prospects. The main
priorities in the period ahead will be to manage the transition to domestic demand-led growth,
secure financial stability, and address the challenges posed by the euro-area crisis in
conjunction with European partners.
Directors underscored Germany’s pivotal role in reducing euro-area and global imbalances.
They called on the authorities to continue to work with European partners to outline clearly and
concretely the further efforts needed to enhance the broader European response to the ongoing
crisis. Furthermore, they urged the authorities to implement policies to spur domestic demand
growth, which will have important beneficial spillover effects in the euro area and globally.
Directors agreed that a natural rebalancing of the sources of growth will likely occur in response
to tight labor market conditions, ample liquidity and low interest rates, and disinflationary
pressures in the euro-area periphery countries. They stressed, however, that structural reforms
to encourage higher investment, remove labor market bottlenecks, and increase economic
efficiency and productivity will be crucial to boost potential growth and aid the rebalancing
process.
Most Directors viewed the current fiscal stance as appropriate, while allowing automatic
stabilizers to operate fully. In the event of a serious economic downturn, more active fiscal
policies within available fiscal space and consistent with the EU fiscal framework would be
needed. A few Directors were of the view that a fiscal stimulus is warranted to aid the regional
and global economic recovery. Directors encouraged growth-oriented revenue and expenditure
reforms, including measures to enhance tax and expenditure efficiency.
Directors noted that, despite progress in financial reform and in securing financial stability, the
banking sector remains vulnerable to external shocks because of high leverage, dependence on
wholesale finance, and low capital quality and profitability. They urged the authorities to step up
the pace of implementation of the 2011 Financial Sector Assessment Program Update
recommendations. In this regard, Directors called for greater efforts to restructure
Landesbanken and strengthen the crisis management framework. They also welcomed
pre-emptive reactivation of the backstop facility for financial institutions, as well as the steps
being taken to establish a framework for implementing macroprudential policies following
European Union initiatives. Directors noted that broadening the channels of financial
intermediation would facilitate the allocation of resources towards innovation and new engines
of growth.

4
Directors commended the exceptional performance of the labor market resulting from past
reforms, and welcomed the ongoing efforts to increase the labor force through the higher
participation of female and older workers and the migration of skilled workers. They encouraged
further enhancements to the system of education and training.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat

Statement by Hubert Temmeyer, Executive Director for Germany
June 29, 2012
I thank the staff for a focused and balanced analysis of the German economy and convey my authorities’
appreciation of the fruitful and detailed discussions they had with the IMF team during this year’s Article
IV mission. Their dedication to gather a broad range of views and a continued dialogue is considered to
be very helpful for achieving a mutual understanding of the issues at stake.
Macroeconomic outlook
The staff paper rightly describes the robust economic development of the German economy over the
course of the past year and we agree that the main downside risks to the near-term outlook are of an
external nature. While the discussion generally focuses more on risks arising from the debt crisis in some
euro area countries, the emphasis on the high global interconnectedness of the German economy in the
staff report is important and requires a broad assessment of risks. I agree with the staff on the main
downside risks, but potential upside risks, in particular the possibility that uncertainty recedes more
quickly than anticipated, should also be taken into consideration.
External vs. domestic drivers of economic growth
My authorities remain fully committed to further strengthening domestic sources of growth whose
contribution to annual real growth has markedly increased and already surpassed the contribution of net
exports in the last years. Overall, we agree with the staff that the conditions for higher domestic demand
remain favorable, namely increasing household incomes and employment, strong balance sheets of
households and the corporate sector, and a supportive financing environment. While a pick-up in asset
prices can have positive effects on wealth and consumption, my authorities nevertheless will monitor
increases closely to detect any formation of asset price bubbles early on. At the same time, since
Germany is among the world’s most open large economies, external demand will naturally continue to
play an important role for its economic growth. Currently, many regions in the world enjoy higher growth
rates, whereas demographic strains weigh on Germany’s potential growth. Furthermore, as pointed out
by the staff, German export performance also benefits other European countries.
Current account developments
In the current cyclical position of the German economy, higher domestic demand fuelled by favorable
labor market developments, robust construction activity and favorable financing conditions will likely
contribute to a rebalancing between euro area countries. However, in this process medium-term price
stability in the euro area must be maintained. The main driver for an improved competitiveness of euro
area countries with current account deficits is the continued implementation of their respective reform
agendas. It is important to note that, after reaching its peak already in 2007, the volume of the German
current account surplus with other euro area countries has diminished by over 40 percent by 2011.
I should emphasize that paragraph 34 of the staff report does not correctly reflect my authorities’ views,
as they do not agree with the statement that the German current account position is stronger than
implied by fundamentals. The mere fact that the underlying model cannot explain a country’s current
account position with a limited set of fundamentals does not by itself allow such a conclusion.
Furthermore, my authorities do not see that specific current account benchmarks of two or four percent

2
of GDP, as suggested by staff, are helpful. As stated on the occasion of last year’s Article IV discussion,
the German current account surplus is not the result of targeted policy measures, but the outcome of
complex market processes and largely explained by a multitude of private business decisions.
Securing sustainable growth and steering through an uncertain economic environment
The continued steadfast implementation of sound structural, macroeconomic, and financial sector
policies is the basis for sustainable growth, both in the short term and the medium term.
Structural policies
Regarding potential growth and the strengthening of domestic sources of growth, we agree with the staff
that a higher labor participation, in particular among women and older persons, as well as increased
migration will be needed. The staff’s policy recommendations are well taken, as they address foreseeable
supply-side challenges on the labor market and the need to sustain the profitability and competitiveness
of the German economy.
The employment rate of women and men aged 20-64 is approaching my authorities’ target of 77 percent
while the EU employment rate target of 75 percent has already been surpassed. To better tap the
domestic workforce, and also to attract qualified workers from abroad, the German government has
established, in 2011, the “Skilled Labor Strategy” which includes measures to improve the availability of
childcare facilities, to promote more family-friendly working hours in cooperation with the relevant
business associations, to reduce, by 2015, the share of persons aged 20-29 that lack vocational training
from 17 percent to 8.5 percent, to increase the number of academics and the share of women with a
degree in natural sciences, to reintegrate the older unemployed into the labor markets, and to increase
the effectiveness of existing labor market instruments.
Regarding growth-oriented tax policy, any measure will need to be analyzed in the context of fiscal
sustainability. As pointed out last year, the introduction of an allowance for the normal return on new
equity would result in significant revenue losses, as observed elsewhere, and is therefore not under
consideration.
Fiscal policies
Fiscal consolidation and respecting the requirements of the European Stability and Growth Pact is a key
common objective of all EU countries. In addition, the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance,
including the Fiscal Compact, was signed by 25 EU member states. Compliance with these legal
commitments is essential since a sound and predictable fiscal framework, including national fiscal rules,
constitutes a much needed anchor and an element of crisis resolution in an uncertain financial market
environment. It will be instrumental in securing confidence through a credible fiscal policy and the
reduction of elevated levels of public debt in many EU countries, including Germany.
My authorities agree with the staff that there is no need for a fiscal stimulus at the current stage of the
business cycle and are skeptical about a debt-financed stimulus of the economy. The staff paper correctly
reiterates the findings that potential spill-over effects from expansionary fiscal measures in Germany to
relevant EMU partner countries would be negligible.

Financial sector
When assessing the vulnerabilities of the German banking sector, it has to be differentiated between
specific parts of the sector. German banks differ substantially in business models and funding structure.
The profitability of banks has been improving after the financial crisis with especially the savings and
cooperative banks remaining profitable even during the crisis. While wholesale funding, which has been
decreasing substantially, continues to be part of the banks’ funding strategy, the share of deposits
relative to total liabilities has been rising for several years. The adjustment process in the Landesbanken
sector is ongoing. Progress is being made with respect to reducing risk weighted assets, focusing on core
business as lending to domestic SMEs and municipalities as well as downsizing, including the
restructuring process of a major Landesbank.
Raising capital as required by Basel III is well on track. Additionally, the early compliance of the majority
of affected German banks with the capital requirements of the European Banking Authority (EBA) has
helped to foster the resilience of institutions and to address vulnerabilities. When assessing the quality of
capital, it should be kept in mind that the recent EBA exercise showed that German banks are able to
convert their supposedly low quality capital into core tier 1 capital. In March 2012 my authorities
reactivated the Special Financial Market Stabilization Fund (SoFFin) that can provide guarantees and loans
to stabilize banks, if required. This was done for precautionary purposes only with currently no
foreseeable cases of utilization.
My authorities remain committed to the recommendations of last year’s FSAP to enhance the existing
financial stability framework where appropriate. Financial stability requires constant work on the
regulatory and supervisory framework and progress on the FSAP recommendations is being made.
Systemic oversight and macro-prudential supervision will be strengthened through an operationally
independent Financial Stability Commission comprising all relevant regulatory and supervisory bodies in
Germany with a central role for the Bundesbank. Its most prominent task will be the continuous analysis
of financial stability, identification of potential threats and issuance of recommendations and warnings. As
a precondition for successful analytical work, the Bundesbank will have access to all necessary
information from the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) and the possibility to request
economic and trade data from financial institutions under supervision will further enhance information
flows. At the same time, the BaFin will have comprehensive access to financial stability analysis conducted
by the Bundesbank. It is envisaged that the Financial Stability Commission will be established by January
2013.
Further steps are being taken to improve the crisis management framework. After the bank restructuring
law coming into force in December 2010 the setting up of recovery and resolution plans – in line with
recommendations from the Financial Stability Board (FSB) – is progressing.
