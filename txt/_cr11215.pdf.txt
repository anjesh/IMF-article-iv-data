Staff Report for the 2011 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2011 Consultation with Spain
(in consultation with other departments)
Approved by Ajai Chopra and Martin Mühleisen
July 7, 2011
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Context: Spain’s policy response to its economic challenges over the last year has been strong
and wide-ranging, helping strengthen market confidence. The economy is gradually recovering
and the rebalancing is underway. Growth has picked up as strong exports outweighed weak
domestic demand, reducing the current account deficit. But unemployment remains unacceptably
high, inflation is again above the euro area average and sovereign and bank funding costs remain
elevated and volatile. The recovery is likely to be modest and export-led, with significant
downside risks dominating, especially that of further contagion from rising concerns about
sovereign risks in the euro area.
Challenges: Unwinding imbalances accumulated during the long boom and reallocating
resources across sectors will take years and will require determined policy action. And many of
the underlying problems of the Spanish economy, especially weak productivity growth and a
dysfunctional labor market, remain to be fully addressed.
Policies and staff views: The policy agenda remains challenging and urgent—there can be no let
up in the reform momentum. Ambitious fiscal consolidation is underway but is based on
optimistic macroeconomic projections and there is a risk of some regional governments missing
their targets. Anchoring fiscal sustainability requires additional action. The financial sector
reform needs to be decisively completed. This needs to be complemented by a bold strengthening
of labor market reforms to substantially reduce unemployment, and following through on the
structural reform agenda to spur productivity and employment. Such a comprehensive strategy
would be helped by broad political and social support.
Authorities’ views: The recovery is likely to be stronger than staff envisages, led by continued
export strength, and risks to the outlook are more balanced. Contagion risks are significant but
the economy would prove resilient, as during past episodes. Fiscal policy is on track to achieve
the ambitious targets and any slippage would be promptly met with additional measures. The
ongoing financial sector reform will be soon completed and should substantially reduce banking
sector pressures. Recent labor market reforms should produce good results over time as the
recovery continues. Spain has made strong progress on liberalizing domestic markets recently,
which is being continued.

I. CONTEXT: NAVIGATING THE STORM
1.
After more than a decade of strong expansion led by a credit-fueled housing
boom, the Spanish economy was hit by three major shocks: the global financial crisis, the
busting of Spain’s domestic boom, and the euro area debt crisis. These shocks exposed
Spain’s vulnerabilities stemming from accumulated imbalances and pushed the economy into
a sharp recession (Figures 1–3).

2.
The euro area debt crisis put pressure on funding costs. Market concerns largely
focused on banks’ real-estate-related losses, the large fiscal deficit and the weak growth
prospects. This created a negative feedback loop between bank and sovereign risk, the
intensity of which varied over time.


The Greek crisis (May-June 2010). Following the initial wave of the euro area debt
crisis, spreads on Spanish sovereign debt rose sharply, the repo market for Spanish
securities became illiquid, and banks’ ECB borrowing jumped. Market sentiment
subsequently improved following the first wave of the Spanish policy response and
banks gradually regained access to market funding by turning to central counterparty
platforms.



The Irish crisis (November-December 2010). The crisis of the Irish banking system
brought Spanish banks under renewed market scrutiny, given some apparent

5
similarities. To allay market concerns, the authorities, especially the Bank of Spain
(BdE), required banks to enhance disclosure of their exposure to troubled sectors and
raised capital requirements. Spanish banks maintained funding market access,
although generally at less favorable conditions than peers.


The Portuguese crisis (March–April 2011). In contrast to the other episodes, as the
Portuguese crisis deepened, Spanish spreads barely moved, reflecting Spain’s
improved market perceptions and strengthening fundamentals. However, as concerns
over a potential Greek restructuring surfaced in early summer, Spanish spreads
widened again to around the previous highs amid a generalized increase in risk
aversion, ECB borrowing by Spanish banks also increased slightly.

3.
The policy response to Spain’s economic challenges over the last year has been
strong and wide-ranging, helping strengthen market confidence. The economy was
shown to be resilient and policymakers responsive. The resulting improvement in market
confidence was critical not just for Spain, but, given Spain’s systemic size, for the euro area
as a whole. From mid-2010, the Spanish authorities undertook a series of measures targeting
the main economic problems facing the country, broadly in line with recommendations from
previous Article IV consultations. Most importantly:


Fiscal. Consolidation was front-loaded in the May 2010 package, the 2010 deficit
target was hit, a strong draft pension reform was agreed with social partners and
approved by the lower house of Parliament, and transparency was enhanced.



Banks. The saving bank sector was substantially reshaped (while minimizing cost to
the taxpayer), capital standards were strengthened, and transparency was improved
(Box 1).



Labor. The 2010 reform increased hiring incentives by easing dismissal costs and
criteria, and by granting firms greater flexibility to opt out of collective agreements.
Collective bargaining was further reformed in June 2011.

4.
But Spain is not out of the danger zone—there can be no let up in the reform
momentum. Many of the imbalances and structural weaknesses accumulated during the
boom remain to be fully addressed. The outlook is difficult and risks elevated. The
overarching and self-reinforcing policy objectives should be to:


further enhance market confidence to ensure Spain continues to avoid being drawn
into the euro area debt crisis, and



fully address the imbalances of the boom-bust cycle to move Spain to a new
sustainable growth model.

Box 1. Savings Bank Reform
The savings bank landscape has been substantially reconfigured.


The number of institutions has been reduced from 45 to 18. Two small ailing savings banks were
intervened and resolved. By mid-2010, the BdE approved seven mergers or takeovers and the creation of
five institutional protection systems (“SIPs”), one of which subsequently broke up. Seven of the
consolidation operations benefited from capital support in the form of convertible preference shares from
the state bank support vehicle (“FROB”) for a total of €9.7 billion, equivalent to an average of 2 percent of
total risk-weighted assets or 25 percent of Tier 1 capital of the seven. The associated restructuring plans
envisage a reduction in the number of branches and staff ranging between 10–25 percent, and
12-18 percent, respectively. Progress is already being made, with the number of branches down 14 percent
since the peak in 2008 and employees down 7 percent for the system as a whole.


New capital requirements prompted many savings banks to transfer their banking operations to
commercial banks. In February 2011, a new law required by end-September an 8 percent minimum core
capital ratio for all banks, but 10 percent for those that rely heavily on wholesale borrowing and without
significant private shareholdings (in practice, savings banks). In March, the BdE notified that 12 banks, 8
of which were savings banks, must increase their capital by a total of €15 billion, with equity injections by
the FROB as a backstop. Since March, commercial banks have raised the necessary capital; however, with
the break-up of one SIP, the potential capital

be also subject to EC state aid oversight.

II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: A WEAK RECOVERY
5.
Output stabilized in 2010, led by net exports (Box 2, Table 1, and Figures 4–5).
Exports rebounded strongly, as foreign demand recovered and domestic demand was weak,
pushing firms to look for new outlets for their products abroad. Domestic demand’s
contribution to growth was negative, dragged down by fiscal consolidation and the further
downsizing of construction, and despite a fall in the household savings rate. Developments in
Q1 2011 suggest a continuation of the modest, export led, recovery, with output growing only
0.3 percent quarter-on-quarter, compared to 0.8 percent for the euro area as a whole.

Box 2. How Much Has Spain’s Private Sector Rebalanced? 1/
While the “flow” imbalances are improving significantly, reducing the “stock” imbalances and the
rebalancing may still have some way to go. Spain’s long economic boom produced two large, and
interlinked, private sector imbalances:
A bloated construction and real estate sector. Construction activity and employment, and the growth
of new mortgages, have all fallen sharply, in line with the experience of other countries with housing
busts. Construction employment is now 8½ percent of total employment, compared with a peak of 13
percent and an average over the last 30 years of 10 percent. Despite the large flow adjustment, an
overhang remains, requiring further adjustment going forward: house price adjustment seems about twothirds completed, assuming no overshooting, and the stock of unsold units may take another four years to
clear. Household and corporate net lending positions have improved significantly, though household
savings rates have recently fallen back from recent high levels.
High debt levels. The housing boom resulted in high levels of household and corporate sector debt. These
ratios have stabilized, but have not reduced significantly, as income growth is modest. The construction
and real estate sectors remain large, highly leveraged and rely more on bank financing than in other
countries. While credit to the construction sector is falling significantly, substantial adjustment has yet to
be seen in credit to the real estate sector (largely real estate development).
How much further credit has to unwind is highly uncertain, but judging by cross-country comparisons
(which are admittedly only weak benchmarks), this could take a number of years.

The recovery has not been enough to reduce very high levels of unemployment.
At around 21 percent, the unemployment rate is more than twice the euro area average. And
while the adjustment through labor shedding has slowed, labor participation rose as the
economy started to pick up—the increase in unemployment even accelerated in Q1 2011.
Wage growth slowed in 2010, in particular as the effects of public sector wage cuts were felt,
but adjustment clauses in existing collective agreements limited the trend of wage
moderation since the beginning of 2011. Labor productivity rose in part due to labor
shedding and the shift away from construction. This helped reduce unit labor costs, but they
remain high, reflecting the accumulated increases of the boom years.

The housing market has continued to adjust. Housing activity has showed some
signs of stabilization at a low level and housing sales have stabilized. But the adjustment in
house prices has picked up somewhat in 2011, with a decline from peak ranging from 12 to
26 percent depending on the index. Inventory of unsold new units has stabilized, but remains
large, with estimates ranging between 686,000–1½ million units.
8.
Banks are deleveraging but asset quality remains a drag. The weak economy and
the need for banks to delever led to a virtual standstill in lending to the private sector.
Commercial banks increased their market share at the expense of the generally more troubled
savings banks, possibly reflecting flight to quality and savings banks’ restructuring.
Nonperforming loans have increased. Since January 2008, the banking sector has recognized
losses of nearly 9 percent of GDP. Provisions have been bolstered but remain somewhat on
the low side compared to peers when repossessed real estate assets are considered. Lower
lending activity and increasing nonperforming assets have eaten into banks’ interest margins,
while funding costs have been rising since end-2010, also reflecting higher deposit rates as
banks fight for market share and stable funding sources. Banks’ profits have shrunk
markedly, particularly for savings banks, while large international banks benefited from
geographical (and business) diversification. Nonetheless, Spanish banks have bolstered their
Tier 1 capital ratio from 8.4 percent in 2008 to 9.6 percent in 2010. However, Spanish banks’
capitalization remains somewhat on the low side compared to peers. To mitigate funding
pressure, the authorities have extended, with EC approval, the bank bond debt guarantee
scheme until end-2011 and increased banks’ deposit guarantee fund contributions on abovenormal yield deposits.

Ambitious fiscal consolidation is underway and the 2010 deficit target was hit
(Figure 8 and Tables 4 and 5). The deficit improvement of about 2 percentage points of GDP
from 2009 to 9.2 percent of GDP in 2010 reflected both a rebound in revenue, notably in
VAT, and lower expenditure. The pick-up in revenue came partly from the impact of
measures––withdrawal of stimulus measures and increase in VAT and excise rates—and
changes to a monthly VAT refund system that had a one-off effect in 2009. On the spending
side, reversal of the 2008–09 anti-crisis measures and the impact of extraordinary measures

Strong export growth helped stabilize the trade deficit in 2010 while the current
account deficit narrowed to 4½ percent of GDP. While exports rebounded strongly, the
trade deficit remained little changed as import growth picked up, reflecting higher oil prices.
Most of the current account improvement in 2010 was driven by a reduction in the income
deficit on the back of FDI income. The current account deficit was mainly financed by
unwinding portfolio investments abroad. Volatility in other investment flows was largely
smoothed through temporarily higher Euro system refinancing. This helped stabilize the large
negative net international investment position (IIP) (Box 3, Figure 9, and Table 6–7).
11.
Despite recent gains, a significant competitiveness gap remains. During the
recession, headline and core inflation declined significantly as unit labor costs moderated and
the inflation differential, after many years, turned slightly negative. But this was reversed in
early 2010 as energy prices rose and tax increases kicked in, and inflation differentials became
positive again. Estimates of the competitiveness gap vary, but substantially improving the
very negative IIP requires significant further gains in the current account, as indicated by the

(see Selected Issues Paper).
Box 3. Spain’s International Investment Position 1/
Spain’s large net negative international investment position (IIP) indicates potential vulnerability. At close to
90 percent of GDP, the size of Spain’s net IIP largely reflects the accumulation of large current account deficits over
the last decade. To the extent that net external liabilities translate into an income balance deficit, they result in a
durable drag on the external accounts. The external debt sustainability analysis projects gross external debt to start

Large improvements in the IIP require significant further
gains in external performance. The External Sustainability
approach of the CGER methodology focuses on the current
account balance that would halve the net foreign asset position
over 20 years, bringing it back in line with pre-boom levels. This
implies running a balanced current account on average over this
period, compared to a 4½ percent of GDP deficit in 2010. To
achieve this adjustment just via the real effective exchange rate
could require a real depreciation of some 18 percent.

Historical experiences in advanced economies also indicate that large IIP adjustment may take considerable time.
Adjustments have often been helped by nominal depreciation of the exchange rate. As this is not an option for Spain,
continued current account adjustment, and eventually IIP improvement, will need to come from a combination of wage
moderation and productivity gains, rebalancing growth towards tradables, and constraining domestic demand.

III. OUTLOOK: A MODEST CYCLICAL RECOVERY AMIDST HEADWINDS AND TAIL RISKS
12.
Staff projects a modest export-led recovery in the medium term. The moderate
pace reflects the need to unwind accumulated imbalances, high unemployment, fiscal
consolidation, and still-tight financial conditions facing the Spanish economy. Export growth
is projected to remain strong, in line with partner country demand, while domestic demand is
expected to improve gradually, and import growth to remain moderate. Private consumption
is unlikely to rebound strongly as the household saving rate has already returned to below the
euro area average and unemployment remains very high (Figure 10). While strong export
growth and stabilizing domestic conditions will support private, non-construction,
investment, the upside may be constrained by tight financing conditions (especially for
SMEs). Construction should cease to be a drag on growth given the recent sharp downward
adjustment in activity, but the overhang of unsold property will continue to weigh on the
sector. Unemployment is projected to fall only moderately and to remain well above the euro

Risks are tilted to the downside and potentially severe. On the upside, exports
could continue to grow at their recent rapid pace, despite likely softer European growth, and
the impact of recent reforms could be stronger than expected. On the downside, the key risks
are:

13


In the near term, financial conditions could deteriorate further, reflecting rising
concerns about sovereign risks in the euro area. While direct real and financial
exposure to Greece, Ireland, and Portugal are limited, contagion may occur through
confidence effects that can affect perception of credit risk. Given also the significant
exposure of Spanish banks to their sovereign, this could put additional pressure on
sovereign and bank funding costs for Spain, which in turn could feedback to the real
economy. Spain’s financing needs also remain significant for the public sector in
coming months and for banks in early 2012.



In the medium term, a protracted slow recovery in growth and, especially, stubbornly
high unemployment. In this case, domestic headwinds could intensify, starting a
negative cycle of greater-than-expected falls in house prices, delays in bank balance
sheet repair, and faster household and corporate deleveraging. Combined with
potentially unresponsive labor costs, this could undermine employment growth.

Scenarios of negative spillovers from Spain indicate a substantial impact on the rest of
Europe and indeed globally, given the country’s systemic importance (Box 4).
14.
The political context may prove challenging. The governing socialist party is in a
minority and relies on an alliance with two small regional parties to pass legislation. The
center-right main opposition party made substantial gains in the May local elections and has
repeatedly called for an early general election (which is due by March 2012).
Authorities’ views
15.
The authorities viewed the risks to Spain from further concern about sovereign
risks in the euro area as significant but manageable, and pointed to Spain’s strong
fundamentals and policy responsiveness. They firmly believed that Spain’s resilience,
proven in previous episodes of contagion, has been further enhanced by structural reforms
and strong delivery on policy commitments. Given the systemic nature of the risk, the

14
appropriate response should be at the system level, rather than at the level of individual
countries, and the government was confident that the European response would indeed be
sufficiently strong.
16.
The government sees a stronger recovery with growth reaching 2.6 percent by
2014. This rebound is driven chiefly by substantial export growth, reflecting the continued
dynamism of Spanish exports, and more robust domestic investment, especially in machinery
and equipment. The government also projects higher potential growth than staff, due to the
envisaged strong effects of the recent reforms. But despite stronger employment growth, they
also projected unemployment to remain high (16 percent in 2014) in line with staff’s
projections on the back of more resilient labor force participation. The BdE’s forecast for
growth is more in line with that of staff, though with more robust investment and less private
consumption.
Box 4. The Size of Potential Negative Spillovers from Spain
Spain’s IIP, in both gross and net terms, creates the potential for large negative outward spillovers, as countryspecific shocks may be transmitted through both negative valuation effects and international deleveraging. From the
perspective of Spain’s liabilities, the composition of external debt highlights banks as the key channel. International bank
exposures to Spain (based on BIS consolidated foreign claims data) point to the prevalence of German and French banks’
claims (representing respectively a quarter and a fifth of foreign claims at end 2010); other exposures (including
derivatives) from U.S. banks are also significant. Portfolio holdings estimates show the continued predominance of France
and Germany in foreign portfolio investment in Spain, with France the largest non-resident holder of Spanish government
debt in particular.
The allocation of Spain’s foreign assets indicates which
countries could be the most affected by potential Spanish
cross-border deleveraging. Consolidated Spanish banks claims
are focused on Europe (half of the total, two-third of which on the
U.K.), but are also significant in the U.S., Brazil and Mexico
(more recently, the largest Spanish banks have also expanded into
Poland and Turkey). This is partly a reflection of exposures
induced by Spanish FDI holdings abroad, which are concentrated
in the financial sector: relative to host country GDP, those are
significant in particular in Latin America, Portugal, and the U.K.
Foreign portfolio assets held by Spain, although somewhat more
diversified geographically than its portfolio liabilities, remain
focused on Europe (with France, Italy, the Benelux and Germany
together accounting for close to half of the total).
Quantitative assessments of euro area spillovers emphasize
the pivotal role of Spain. Analysis conducted in the context of
the euro area spillover report underscores that the global impact of distress in Greece, Ireland and Portugal is likely to
remain contained to the extent that Spain remains unaffected. Should Spain be affected, the ensuing shock to the other
major economies of the euro area would constitute a systemic event by its magnitude, generating significant global ripples.
Bank exposures to Spain suggest that spillovers would be mainly channeled by German and French banks. As a result,
deleveraging in absolute terms would be the largest within the euro area itself, and would negatively affect European
financial integration.
Spanish international banks are major lenders in Latin American economies. However, such lending is largely
conducted by locally-funded subsidiaries. A shock to the Spanish banking sector may raise the concern of parents
attempting to obtain liquidity and repatriate capital from these profitable foreign affiliates: this could in theory cause a
reduction in local lending. However, subsidiaries are subject to regulations that are designed to prevent such large-scale
flows.

15
IV. POLICY AGENDA: ENHANCING MARKET CONFIDENCE AND MOVING TO A NEW
GROWTH MODEL
17.
Unwinding the imbalances of the boom years and the legacy of the crisis will take
years. While many of the “flow” imbalances are improving significantly (for example, the
external and fiscal deficits and the size of the construction sector), the “stock” problems
remain (stretched private sector and external balance sheets, high unemployment, the
overvalued housing market and stock of unsold units). And some of the underlying problems
of the Spanish economy — especially weak productivity growth and a dysfunctional labor
market — remain to be fully addressed. Combined with the threat of further regional financial
contagion, these weaknesses make the outlook both difficult and risky.
18.
A new growth model is needed. The old model, based on credit and housing booms
drawing employment and financial resources borrowed abroad into low productivity nontradable sectors, was unsustainable and is unlikely (and undesirable) to resume. The new
growth model will need to be more balanced between tradable and non-tradable sectors and
based much more on boosting the supply side of the economy.


For the tradable sector, where labor productivity growth has been stronger but
employment growth minimal, the challenge will be to encourage firms to expand and
hire, while maintaining or improving productivity growth. This calls for strengthening
the business environment and containing costs, which in turn means moderating the
price of labor and reducing price pressure from the non-tradable sector.



For the non-tradable sector, where employment growth has been strong but
productivity growth generally weak, the challenge will be to boost productivity, spur
employment growth outside the construction and public administration sectors, and
contain price pressures. Continuing to foster competition into the sector is critical for
raising productivity and reducing mark-ups. This will need, especially in the nearer
term, to be accompanied by significant moderation of labor costs to spur employment.

19.
This means that while the policy response to date has been strong, this needs to
go further, and there can be no let up in the reform momentum. The key now is to follow
through on the measures already adopted while continuing to strengthen policy settings in
other areas, in particular, fully addressing concerns about banking and fiscal sustainability to
reduce borrowing costs and allow for a reallocation of credit, a bold strengthening of labor
market reforms to substantially reduce unemployment, and fostering greater competition in
domestic markets.
Authorities’ views
20.
The government pointed to the challenges of moving to a new growth model, the
importance of reforms already taken, and the need for continued implementation. They
highlighted the challenges of reallocating significant amounts of labor and resources within

16
the economy, but noted the productivity potential existing in Spain, as evidenced by the
dynamism of exports, the increasing share of exporting firms and the capacity of the
economy to rebalance quicker than expected. They stressed that the priority is now strong
implementation of the existing structural measures, which will take time to have full effect.
While acknowledging the need for some deleveraging, they considered that stocks of private
debt and external liabilities larger than the equilibrium levels before the euro could be
appropriate given financial market integration.
A. Financial Sector: Completing the Reforms
21.
The outlook for the Spanish banking industry remains challenging. Despite some
potential relief from rising lending rates, banks’ net interest income is likely to be under
pressure due to depressed lending activity and elevated funding costs. Given weak economic
activity and high unemployment, non-performing assets are expected to increase further and,
hence, loan loss provisions. Divestment of industrial holdings and non-core activities could
prove one-off sources of income. Cost rationalization will likely provide additional gains,
however, especially in the context of the ongoing mergers (though some smaller ones might
need substantial restructuring).1 While large international Spanish banks may continue to rely
on their geographic and business diversification, the weak profitability outlook of more
domestically-oriented banks might adversely affect their capital buffers.

22.
Funding and liquidity pressure are likely to remain elevated in the near term.
Spanish banks have been able to refinance much of their maturing debt, the amount falling
due in the remainder of this year is relatively limited (less than €40 billion), and maintain

17
access to the repo market. Banks also hold substantial ECB repo-able assets. However, the
lack of bond issuance by smaller Spanish banks, the steady downward trend in the share of
domestic deposits held by savings banks and the higher refinancing needs in 2012 (about
€115 billion, with a peak in the first half) indicate that funding pressure could remain
elevated.

Decisive restructuring of the financial
sector, along the lines envisaged by the
authorities, would help allay market concerns. In
staff’s view, the extent of potential capital needs is
limited and affects only a few institutions. Even if in
the extreme the FROB’s entire borrowing limits
were used in 2011, the level of public debt would
still remain relatively low in Spain compared with
other euro area countries. Any potential need would
also be greatly reduced if the largest savings banks

Sources: WEO; and IMF staff estimates.

18
raise needed capital from the market. Nevertheless, it is also the case that there is a
particularly high range of uncertainty around the valuation of many assets. A decisive
restructuring of the financial sector, combined with robust capital and liquidity buffers,
would reduce uncertainty, protect against tail risks, and foster a faster reallocation of credit
across sectors.


Weak banks. The viability of those weak banks that have little prospect of tapping the
capital market, should be carefully assessed on deliberately conservative assumptions.
For instance, if the FROB were to end up holding a majority equity stake in a bank,
there should be a presumption that the institution is swiftly resolved. Although FROB
equity is already conditional on a restructuring plan, the conditionality could be
strengthened. For example, to safeguard public funds and encourage a quick exit from
FROB auspices, no profit distribution should be allowed until FROB equity stakes are
repurchased (unless a significant portion of equity is sold to private investors and a
rapid exit from FROB is guaranteed).



Buffers. Given the uncertainty about the operating environment, banks should be
encouraged, via pillar II, to achieve capital buffers above the minimum requirements
revised in February 2011, especially for those banks with more uncertain asset
quality. A core Tier 1 ratio of at least 10 percent by the end of 2012, for example,
would bring Spanish banks in line with most well-capitalized large European banks
and could help improve market confidence and hence funding conditions.
Provisioning buffers could also be further strengthened. Spain’s global and domestic
systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) should go further in building
capital (and liquidity) buffers, in line with emerging international consensus.



Stress testing. The Europe-wide stress tests ought to underpin confidence about the
extent of any potential capital needs. It is encouraging that the coverage of Spanish
banks is, again, to be much wider than in the rest of Europe. To strengthen market
confidence, it would be useful to fully disclose the underlying data and specific
methodology behind the results. Consideration could be given to complementing
future stress tests with a review of estimates of loan losses (especially real-estate
related) by a leading independent firm. The results of this review could then be made
public.



Transparency. Enhanced transparency should become a permanent feature of the
Spanish system. The scope, granularity, and comparability of bank-by-bank
information, especially on troubled real estate exposure and some prudential
indicators, could be further improved and published under the aegis of the Bank of
Spain.



Savings bank reform. Transferring banking business to newly-created commercial
banks to be listed on the stock exchange is a crucial step forward, and should be done

19
promptly. Yet savings banks will retain their majority ownership in these newlycreated, and in many cases very large, banking entities. Going forward, savings banks
should become arms-length minority interest institutional investors, which would
likely require their conversion into foundations, as envisaged by the law. To provide a
sound and comprehensive legal and regulatory framework to these entities,
consideration could thus be given to preparing a special law for foundations with
substantial bank interests. Additional improvements to savings bank governance
could be made more immediately, including: (1) further reducing public sector
representation and increasing the number of independent members of executive
boards; (2) applying robust fit-and-proper criteria to all managers and directors; and
(3) ensuring the separation of managerial positions in the controlled and controlling
entities.
Authorities’ views
25.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to completing the ongoing financial
sector strengthening. They were of the view that the new provision and capital requirements
are sufficient to ensure the soundness of the Spanish banking system even in stressed
conditions. In any event, they confirmed their intention to strongly address any shortfalls that
could emerge. They concurred that transparency has proven to be a most useful tool to allay
market sentiment in this uncertain environment, and they will consider ways to enhance
further disclosure of the Spanish banking system, but consider that Spain is already at the
forefront.
26.
On savings banks, the authorities emphasized that the strategy has not been
confined to a mere recapitalization. They stressed rather it has engineered an historic, farreaching, and lasting transformation of the sector. In this regard, further legislative changes,
including regarding foundations, were not viewed as a priority, while strengthening corporate
governance was considered as an ineluctable consequence of the ongoing transformation.
The authorities confirmed that FROB capital injections will be at market price and
temporary; they also pointed out that FROB representatives will oversee strict
implementation of the agreed recapitalization plan.
B. Fiscal Policy: Achieving the Ambitious Consolidation Targets and Beyond
27.
Consolidation is set to intensify in 2011,
aimed at a deficit target of 6 percent of GDP. From
9.2 percent of GDP, the envisaged deficit reduction is
substantial. The full impact of the revenue measures
taken in 2010, the wage and pension freeze, continued
hiring restraint, and further spending cuts introduced
in the 2011 budget should help lower the deficit
automatically. Information through May suggests the

central government is broadly on track. If near-term risks to the outlook materialize, some
additional measures may be necessary (staff project a deficit of 6.2 percent of GDP without
such measures). But the larger risk to the 2011 target is that some regional governments may
again miss their targets.
28.
The government aims to cut the deficit to 2.1 percent of GDP by 2014. From
9.2 percent of GDP in 2010, this implies a deficit reduction of 7.1 percentage points of GDP

Achieving the targets will be challenging.
The deficit target path is appropriate, but the

requires a decisive break with the past (for example, the public sector wage bill is projected
to decline by ½ percent of GDP a year). Spain’s annual financing requirements are also
projected to remain substantial in the next few years, around 20 percent of GDP,
underscoring the need for maintaining market confidence.
30.
Additional measures may thus be required. Staff projects the deficit to decline to
about 4 percent of GDP in 2014. Taking into account the risk stemming from the potentially
weaker growth outlook and the need to build buffers to offset the potential slippage by the
regions, additional measures of about 2 percent of GDP (cumulative through 2014) would be
required to achieve the government’s targets. General government debt would continue to
increase to about 74 percent of GDP. To ensure the debt ratio is on a firmly declining path by
2014 and anchor longer-term sustainability and market expectations, pro-active management
of below-the-line operations (such as privatization) is warranted. And while staff believes the
central government remains committed to taking necessary measures to achieve the overall
targets, the credibility and quality of fiscal policy could be further enhanced by more prudent
macroeconomic projections and spelling out specific measures to ensure the targets are
attained. There is considerable scope for additional measures, including:


further reducing current spending (for example, the wage bill still remains higher
than the euro area average because of hefty past increases in public employment),



cutting investment (which has been well above the EU average levels), and



raising the still relatively low VAT and excise rates especially on petroleum products.

The pension reform and early
achievement of the Medium-Term Objective
(MTO) of a balanced budget would ensure
longer-term sustainability. Continued
consolidation is necessary to bring down the debt
ratio and to address longer-term spending
pressures. Costs associated with aging are
projected to rise by 9 percent of GDP by 2060
(before the pension reform)—larger than other
European countries. The recent draft pension
reform is a landmark improvement and
significantly reduces longer-term pension costs,

but could be further enhanced during the parliamentary approval process (Box 5). In
particular, the transition period could be shortened, incentives for early retirement further
reduced, the link of pension parameters to life expectancy (the “sustainability factor”) could
be made automatic, and the reference period extended to life-time earnings. But securing
long-term sustainability also requires additional adjustment efforts to attain Spain’s MTO of
a balanced budget over the cycle and further reforms to address the pressures from aging
especially healthcare. To help anchor expectations, the government should thus commit to
achieving early its MTO by no later than 2016.1
Box 5. Pension Reform
A draft pension reform was approved by the Lower House in end-June 2011. Key elements
include:





raising the statutory retirement age from 65 to 67, phased in gradually between 2013–27;
increasing the numbers of years to calculate the earnings base (reference period) from 15 to
25 years and the numbers of contribution years to qualify for the full pension from 35 to
38.5 years;
tightening eligibility criteria for early retirement with the minimum retirement age raised
from 61 to 63 years (at least 33 years of contribution, and an increase in the penalty rate; and
introducing a sustainability factor aimed at reassessing the parameters of the system every
5 years starting in 2027 to factor in any impact of higher life expectancy.

Staff estimates the reform would reduce
pension expenditure by about 2 percent of
GDP by 2050. Including the full impact of
the sustainability factor, the savings could
be considerably higher, amounting to about
3½ percent of GDP. The pension reform
could also have an important positive effect
on output especially in the long-run. Staff
estimates using the IMF’s GIMF model
suggests that the proposed reform would
increase the potential growth by 0.2–
0.3 percent in the long-run, propelled by
rising consumption and crowding-in effects
on investment as government debt is
reduced.

Improving fiscal frameworks could help underpin the fiscal consolidation
targets.2/ Spain’s fiscal framework is strong in some areas but has scope for improvement in
others, especially related to subnational governments:


1

Enhancing transparency: while central government standards are strong and the
BdE’s reporting of outstanding liabilities of all levels of government is
comprehensive, the transparency of sub-national accounts has substantial scope to
See Selected Issues Papers.

24
improve. Specifically, sub-national accounts should be available at the same
frequency and coverage as the central government, and quarterly reporting on a
national accounts basis should be an immediate goal. The Fiscal and Financial Policy
Council (CPFF) should also accelerate the timetable for approving regional fiscal
adjustment plans and should start publishing them alongside the assessment of the
Ministry of Finance.


Strengthening mechanisms to ensure subnational compliance with deficit targets. The
current mechanism relies on “naming and shaming” and withholding debt
authorizations from regions that miss agreed targets. These debt authorization
restrictions should be strictly applied. Further enhancements to the system could also
be considered, such as increasing the frequency of CPFF monitoring, widening the
scope for cutting joint investment and discretionary expenditure transfer to regions,
and securing voluntarily commitments specifying that regions missing their targets
would implement certain concrete consolidation measures.



An independent fiscal council could help strengthen credibility by providing the
macroeconomic parameters for the budget; estimating the cost of proposed
legislation; and providing long-term fiscal projections including eventually for the
social security sustainability adjustments.



Institutionalizing periodic public-sector-wide review of major spending programs,
using existing mechanisms, to improve the quality and durability of the necessary
multi-year adjustment, and benchmark best practices across subnational governments.
This could also be complemented by integrating the general government budgetary
process, the SGP Updates, and the three-year rebalancing plans into a fully-fledged
medium-term budget framework. Enacting spending control mechanisms, including
expenditure rules (as envisaged), at all levels of government would also complement
the deficit rule.

Authorities’ views
33.
The government emphasized its commitment to the deficit targets. They viewed
staff’s macroeconomic scenario as pessimistic noting that their growth forecast projections
for 2010 had proven more correct than staff’s. The government was confident that the debt
authorization mechanism and rebalancing plans were sufficient to deliver the required
consolidation at the regional level and that any possible overshooting by some regions would
be limited in size and likely offset by over-performance in others. The government also
stressed they stand ready and committed to taking additional actions required to meet the
general government target, which was unconditional. They agreed the importance of aiming
for the MTO beyond 2014 to ensure fiscal sustainability. The pension reform has already
gone through Congress and is expected to be passed into law shortly.

25
34.
While the government considered the existing fiscal frameworks to be sufficient
to achieve their objectives, they saw some scope for improvement over the medium
term. They agreed on the need for further subnational fiscal transparency, building on recent
progress in this area, while stressing the importance of accountability of all governments to
achieve the deficit objective. The government is also considering spending control
mechanisms at all levels of government. The government did not view an independent fiscal
council or a full-fledged medium-term budgeting framework as playing a major supporting
role in Spain.
C. Labor: Bolder Reform Needed
35.
Structural flaws in Spain’s labor market play a large role in explaining the
heavy unemployment cost of the crisis. Unemployment soared to above 20 percent, despite
an output loss broadly in line with the euro area, as most of the adjustment was pushed onto
employment (Figure 11). Wage flexibility was hamstrung by the wage bargaining system,
which includes inflation indexation, and the protection of permanent contracts (which can
foster wage demands detrimental to employment). And wage agreements negotiated at the
industry and province levels are automatically extended to the entire province and industry,
without much scope to opt-out for individual firms or workers. Prior to the crisis, the
bargaining system and high employment protection also significantly contributed to the large
and persistent inflation differential of Spain with the euro area during the boom years and
hence the deterioration in competitiveness.1
36.
The labor market is being reformed in the right direction. The 2010 reform
increased hiring incentives by easing dismissal costs and criteria, and by granting firms
greater flexibility to opt out of collective agreements. In June 2011, collective bargaining was
further reformed toward greater firm-level flexibility through: (1) establishing the prevalence
of firm-level agreements, especially over provincial ones; (2) reducing the possibility of
indefinite extension of previous agreements when social partners cannot agree on a new
agreement; (3) further easing opt-outs of collective agreements; and (4) giving firms more
internal flexibility. Most interlocutors including social partners, the International Labor
Organization (ILO), and academics broadly agreed the labor market reforms to date were in
the right direction. Nevertheless, as many of the interlocutors also underscored, the reforms
were incomplete and remain a work in progress. For example, they did not directly address
inflation indexation and leave open the possibility to make sectoral agreements prevail over
firm-level agreements if social partners agree to do so. And the success of these reforms will
depend on implementation by social partners and by the courts.
37.
A bold strengthening of these reforms is needed to substantially reduce
unemployment. The results to date do not provide sufficient confidence that the reforms will
1

See Selected Issues Paper.

26
quickly deliver an improvement in labor market dynamics that is as strong as the severity of
the problem requires. Despite some positive effects from the 2010 reform (in terms of use of
opt-outs and reduction of dismissal costs), unemployment is at very high levels and still
increasing and the share of permanent contracts in total new hiring remains low. Spain’s
unemployed need a decisive improvement in employment prospects, without which Spain
could face persistently high unemployment and labor market duality, with the young
especially affected by joblessness and revolving temporary contracts. A bolder reform would
also help counter the headwinds from the deleveraging of the economy and prompt the
reallocation of labor across sectors. Policy should thus err on the side of boldness rather than
gradualism.
38.

This calls for deepening and broadening the reforms to date. In particular:



Collective bargaining needs to be effectively decentralized to the firm level to allow
wages to adjust to firm-specific conditions and foster employment and the
reallocation of labor. The scope for firm-level flexibility offered by the June 2011
reform should be actively pursued by social partners and ideally should also be
strengthened during the Parliamentary approval process. But if there are not clear and
immediate signs the reform is delivering the necessary firm level flexibility, a more
radical reform should be introduced.



Social partners should move away from inflation indexation, which is endemic
compared with other countries. It is inconsistent with the functioning of a currency
union and especially damaging during times of high unemployment, structural
shocks, and cost-push inflation. Instead, reference could be made to guidelines based
on productivity and regaining competitiveness with main trading partner countries.
The elimination of indexation should be accompanied by stronger competition in the
nontradable sector to keep price increases moderate.



Severance payments should be further lowered to at least EU average levels and
should be better designed to make permanent hires more attractive. Despite the 2010
reform, severance payments remain high and still likely constitute a significant
deterrent to the use of permanent contracts once employment growth strengthens.



These measures should be supported by broader reforms, including further improving
the retraining of workers with mismatched skills, supporting youth employment, and
ensuring that the incentives to return to work are sufficient. Recent improvements in
active labor market policies, such as allowing private placement firms, should be
especially useful in this regard.

Authorities’ views
39.
The government argued that the labor market reforms have been strong. They
acknowledged the relatively limited evidence so far that the 2010 reform is improving

27
employment prospects and reducing labor market duality. However, they expect the impact
of the reform to strengthen over time as the recovery continues. The recent collective
bargaining reform is seen as a major step forward that will greatly enhance the opportunities
for firm-level flexibility. The government recognized that the success of the reform will very
much depend on implementation by social partners. They also stressed inflation indexation is
considered a prerogative of social partners and cannot be legislated against. The BdE also
saw the need for a bold strengthening of reforms, though they also saw significant potential
in the recent collective bargaining reform.
D. Other Structural Reforms for the New Growth Model
40.
Achieving strong and sustainable growth requires, over the longer term, strong
productivity gains. This was not achieved even during the boom period with GDP growth
dependent on the extensive use of labor and, to a lesser extent, capital. The lack of
productivity growth at the aggregate level is only partly due to a high weight of lowproductivity sectors (like construction) in the economy. More than half of the productivity
differential with the rest of the EU is not explained by the sectoral composition of the
economy, and weak productivity growth is prevalent in almost all sectors (Figures 12 and
13).
41.
This weak productivity growth has been attributed to a number of factors. These
include:


policy and regulatory rigidities limiting competition and hindering the business
environment (e.g. firm startup costs are particularly high),



low efficiency linked to the preponderance of SMEs that are unable to exploit fully
economies of scale (e.g. similarly to Italy, only 24 percent of businesses have more
than 250 employees versus 57 percent in Germany and 46 percent in France, and
productivity is lower),



limited R&D and innovation (e.g. spending on R&D is well below the EU average
and Spain has one the lowest number of patents per capita), and



an inefficient accumulation of human and technological capital (e.g. Spain has a high
proportion of university graduates, but dropout rates are high, completion times are
long and the return to education is low), worsened by the duality of the labor market
(with low incentives for firms to invest in human capital) and barriers to mobility
from the under-developed housing rental market. The loss in human capital is
amplified the longer high unemployment persists, in particular for the young.

42.
Spain has taken productivity-enhancing measures but more needs to be done.
Positive steps have been taken over the past year, such as the ongoing implementation of the
Services Directive, measures to lower start up costs of firms, and the removal of the

28
mortgage deduction for income tax. But significant entry barriers remain in a number of
sectors, and further liberalization is critical for regaining competitiveness, boosting
employment, and reducing mark-ups. Key reforms, many of which are on the government’s
agenda, should include: fully implementing the EU Services Directive and Sustainable
Economy law, opening up regulated professions, increasing competition in the energy sector,
continuing to foster the growth of the under-developed housing rental market, reducing
restrictions on retail opening hours, reforming the bankruptcy law, and ensuring the reduction
of payment delays (as per recent legislation).

V. STAFF APPRAISAL
43.
The policy response to Spain’s economic challenges over the last year has been
strong and wide-ranging, helping strengthen market confidence. The economy was
shown to be resilient and policymakers responsive. The resulting improvement in market
confidence was critical not just for Spain, but, given Spain’s systemic size, for the euro area
as a whole.
44.
The economy is gradually recovering and the rebalancing is underway. Growth
has picked up, led by strong exports. Private sector savings-investment balances have
improved, helping stabilize debt ratios and reduce the current account deficit. The housing
market continues to adjust. Real wages are falling, as necessary given the labor market
situation, and unit labor costs are improving. However, unemployment is unacceptably high,
especially for the young. Inflation has also picked up, and is again above the euro area
average. And sovereign and bank funding costs remain elevated and volatile.

29
45.
The recovery is likely to be modest and export-led over the medium term. Export
growth is projected to remain strong, in line with partner country demand, while domestic
demand is expected to improve gradually. Unemployment is projected to fall only
moderately in the medium term and to remain well above the euro area average. Inflation is
forecast to decline to around two percent as transitory factors fade. And while house prices
likely have further to adjust, the drag on output from the residential property sector should
cease.
46.
Downside risks dominate. On the upside, exports could continue to grow at their
recent rapid pace, despite likely softer European growth, and the impact of recent reforms
could prove stronger than expected. On the downside, the key medium term risk is an
intensification of domestic headwinds, and in the near term, rising concerns about sovereign
risks in the euro area.
47.
The policy agenda remains challenging and urgent – there can be no let up in the
reform momentum. Unwinding accumulated imbalances and reallocating resources across
sectors will take years and many difficult policy choices. Combined with the risks to the
outlook, this means that the reforms to date need to be strengthened. Such a comprehensive
strategy would be helped by broad political and social support.
48.
A decisive implementation of the envisaged financial sector reform strategy
would help allay lingering market concerns. Banks that need to raise capital should do so
promptly from the market. Those that have no prospect of covering their shortfalls from the
market should be rapidly restructured or quickly resolved. As envisaged, FROB support
should be seen as a last resort, provided at market terms and strictly temporary. In light of the
uncertain operating environment and comparing with other jurisdictions, staff sees merit in
further building capital, liquidity and provisioning buffers in the system over time. Building
on recent improvements in transparency would help market participants to form a sounder
view of the actual situation of the Spanish banking sector. Further improvements in corporate
governance would provide an additional impulse to the ongoing transformation of the savings
bank sector.
49.
Ambitious fiscal consolidation is underway. If near-term risks to the outlook
materialize, some additional measures may be necessary. But the larger risk to the 2011
target is that some regional governments may again miss their targets. This needs to be
avoided: the general government fiscal target should remain the overarching objective,
hence, all levels of government should deliver on their commitments.
50.
Achieving the medium-term fiscal targets will likely require further action. First,
the targets are based on strong spending restraint. Second, under staff’s less optimistic
macroeconomic projections, additional fiscal measures of about two percent of GDP will be
required through 2014, which also argues for building strong buffers in the 2012, and future,
budgets. Third, to ensure the debt ratio is on a firmly declining path by 2014 and to anchor

30
longer-term expectations, the government should commit to an early date to achieve the
MTO of a balanced budget and should pro-actively manage below-the-line operations (such
as privatization). The draft pension reform should also be quickly passed and implemented,
and ideally strengthened in some areas.
51.
Improving fiscal frameworks would help underpin the consolidation targets. In
the short term, the focus should be on sub-national finances. In particular, by improving the
transparency of subnational accounts and by strictly applying existing policy levers to ensure
subnational government compliance with deficit targets. In the medium term:
institutionalizing a nationwide comprehensive review of major spending programs could help
identify high-quality expenditure savings; an independent fiscal council could bolster fiscal
credibility; and spending control mechanisms, including spending rules, could be usefully
implemented at all levels of government.
52.
A bold strengthening of labor market reforms is needed to substantially reduce
unacceptably high unemployment. The labor market is being reformed in the right
direction. But the results to date do not provide sufficient confidence that the reforms will
quickly deliver an improvement in labor market dynamics that is as strong as the severity of
the problem requires. This calls for deepening and broadening the reforms so far. In
particular: collective bargaining needs to be effectively decentralized to the firm level; social
partners should move away from inflation indexation; and severance payments should be
further lowered to at least EU average levels. These measures should be supported by
broader reforms, such as retraining.
53.
Further progress needs to be made on enhancing competition in nontradable
sectors. Key reforms, many of which are on the government’s agenda, should include: fully
implementing the Services Directive and Sustainable Economy law, opening up regulated
professions, greater competition in the energy sector, continuing to foster the growth of the
under-developed housing rental market, reducing restrictions on retail opening hours,
reforming the bankruptcy law, and ensuring the reduction of payment delays (as per recent
legislation).
54.

It is proposed to hold the next Article IV consultation on the regular 12-month cycle.

ANNEX I: FISCAL AND EXTERNAL SUSTAINABILITY
Spain has large public sector and external funding needs for the next few years. External
funding needs are largely driven by bank debt. The government’s funding pressure arises
largely from amortization payments. On a year-to-date basis, the central government has
raised roughly half of net funding needs for 2011, in line with its pattern from 2010. Relative
to its European peers the public sector debt-to-GDP ratio is relatively low. And, debt rollover
is a limited portion of central government debt – the average maturity has lengthened in
recent years to 6.7 years. Still, market scrutiny of its ability to meet its financing needs is
high and interest costs on newly-issued debt have risen.
While the standard debt sustainability analysis (DSA) framework is limited by its mediumterm horizon and relatively mechanistic assumptions, it provides a useful assessment that can
be complemented by longer-term analysis.1 Under unchanged policies, the public DSA for
Spain projects further increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium term. Although
expected additional measures would contribute to stabilize that ratio, stress scenarios could
result in further increases. The external debt sustainability analysis projects gross external
debt to start declining over the medium term, but stress scenarios could result in further
increases.
Baseline Scenarios
In the baseline scenario for the fiscal sustainability assessment, the underlying fiscal position
is projected to improve slightly over the medium-term, with the gross financing need-to-GDP
ratio is projected to fall gradually from 30.4 percent in 2011. Still, though improving, relative
to history, gross government financing need is expected to remain large. On the external side,
the consolidation of external liabilities observed in 2010, and the narrowing in the current
account deficit that is projected to continue, both contribute to stabilizing Spain’s external
debt and eventually putting in on a downward path.
Alternative Scenarios for Fiscal Sustainability


1

Interest rate. Real interest rates in the baseline scenario are assumed to average
2.4 percent over the projection period. The impact of an increase in interest rate is not
expected to have a significant effect on interest expenditure. Should real interest rates
increase above the historical average of 1.3 percent (the historical average is
depressed in large part by relatively high GDP deflators in the mid 2000s) and reach
3.4 percent (representing a ½ standard deviation shock), debt would increase to
78.7 percent of GDP by 2016, about 2½ percentage points of GDP above the baseline.
See Selected Issues Paper

52
The modest impact on interest payment reflects the long average life of central
government debt, whose average maturity has risen from 5.6 years in 2000 to
6.6 years in 2010. As a result, debt rollover over the forecasting period is expected to
modest.


Growth. Relative to interest rates, Spain’s public debt profile is more sensitive to
shocks to growth. Should growth fall by about a little over 1 percentage point over
the forecasting period, the debt-to-GDP ratio could reach 91.8 percent by 2016,
about16 percentage points higher relative to the baseline.



Euro depreciation and contingent liabilities. In the case of a 30 percent nominal
depreciation of the euro, after adjusting for domestic inflation, and a contingent
liability shock of 10 percent of GDP, the debt-to-GDP trajectory is expected to
increase to 86½ percent. It is notable that the portion of the government’s liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies is small, at less than 2 percent. Thus, all else being
equal, the impact of a sudden depreciation in the euro exchange rate on the debt
profile would be modest.

Alternative Scenarios for External Sustainability


Interest rate. The impact of a permanent ½ standard deviation shock to the interest
rate for all outstanding external debt – a 40 basis point increase from the baseline –
would increase debt compared to the baseline by roughly 7 percentage points of GDP
by 2016.



Growth shock. A permanent ½ standard deviation shock to the projected real growth
rate – corresponding to a prolonged period of anemic growth of 0.6 percent on
average - would increase debt compared to the baseline by roughly 14 percentage
points of GDP at the projection horizon.



Standard combined shock. A permanent ¼ standard deviation shock applied to the
projected interest rate, real growth rate and current account balance would increase
debt compared to the baseline by about 13 percentage points of GDP by 2016.



Country specific combined shock. Given Spain specific circumstances, a tail-risk
scenario is also examined, where a permanent one standard deviation shock is applied
to the interest rate – 80 basis points above the baseline-, and a ½ standard deviation
shocks to the growth rate. In this stress-test, by 2016 external debt would surge
compared to the baseline by about 21 percentage points of GDP.

2011 Article IV Consultation: A staff team comprising J. Daniel (Head), K. Honjo,
F. Jaumotte, J. Vacher (all EUR), A. Giustiniani (MCM); E. Vidon (SPR); and
R. Romeu (FAD) visited Madrid on June 9–21, 2011 to conduct the 2011 Article IV
Consultation discussions. Ms. Balsa, Mr. De Las Casas, and Ms. Aparici from the
Spanish Executive Director’s office, joined the discussions. For outreach, the mission
met with parliamentarians, trade unions, employers’ organizations, bankers, and
independent analysts. The concluding statement was published and the staff report is
expected to be published as well. The consultation includes an annex on Spain’s
Fiscal and External Sustainability. Spain is on a standard 12-month cycle. The last
Article IV consultation discussions were concluded on July 30, 2010 (EBM/10/72-4).

VI.

Exchange Rate Arrangements and Restrictions: Spain’s currency is the euro,
which floats freely and independently against other currencies. Spain has accepted the
obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange rate
system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international
transactions, other than restrictions notified to the Fund under Decision No. 144
(52/51).

APPENDIX II. SPAIN: STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of July 1, 2011

I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance.
Fiscal sector: Spain does not report the fiscal accounts of the autonomous communities (the
sub-national governments which are wholly responsible for education, health and other social
expenditure) on a quarterly national accounts basis. While the aggregate sub-national
accounts can be derived from the general government accounts that the Spanish authorities
report on a quarterly basis, the balances of the 17 individual autonomous communities
remain unavailable, which is at variance with the Concluding Statement calling for the
reporting of individual autonomous communities on a national accounts basis.

II. Data Standards and Quality

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with Spain
On July 22, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Spain. 1
Background
After more than a decade of strong expansion led by a credit-fueled housing boom, the Spanish
economy was hit by three major shocks: the global financial crisis, the busting of Spain’s
domestic boom, and the euro area debt crisis. These shocks exposed Spain’s vulnerabilities
stemming from accumulated imbalances and pushed the economy into a sharp recession, with
the euro area debt crisis subsequently putting pressure on funding costs.
The economy has been gradually recovering and rebalancing. Growth has gradually picked up
from the first quarter of 2010, led by strong exports as the rebalancing to external demand
proceeded. Private sector savings-investment balances have improved, helping stabilize debt
ratios and reduce the current account deficit. The housing market continued to adjust. Real
wages moderated and unit labor costs improved. However, at around 21 percent, the
unemployment rate is more than twice the euro area average. Inflation has picked up, led by
energy prices and indirect taxes, and is again above the euro area average. A reform of
collective bargaining aiming at greater firm-level flexibility was presented to Parliament in June
2011, complementing the June 2010 labor market reform.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summing up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
Fiscal consolidation is underway, aimed at achieving a deficit target of 3 percent of GDP in
2013. The fiscal deficit improved by about 2 percentage points of GDP from 2009 to 9.2 percent
of GDP in 2010, and the 2010 deficit target was reached - reflecting both a rebound in revenue,
notably in VAT, and lower expenditure. About half of the regions missed their targets, which
was more than offset by over-performance by the central government. A comprehensive draft
pension reform was agreed with social partners, and the dissemination of fiscal data at the
regional level was enhanced.
Banks are deleveraging and increasing their capital buffers but asset quality has continued to
deteriorate. Lower lending activity and increasing nonperforming assets have reduced banks’
interest margins, as funding costs have been rising since end-2010. Nonetheless, Spanish
banks have increased their Tier 1 capital ratio from 8.4 percent in 2008 to 9.6 percent in 2010,
with large international banks continuing to benefit from geographical and business
diversification. The saving bank sector was reshaped through a merger/integration process that
led the number of savings banks to decline from 45 to 18. Capital standards were strengthened
through a decree approved in February 2011 that prompted savings banks to transfer their
banking activities to commercial bank entities and prepare plans for recapitalization through
IPOs or participation of the Fund for Orderly Bank Restructuring (Fondo de Reestructuración
Ordenada Bancaria—FROB). Transparency was also improved through enhanced disclosure of
individual banks’ real estate exposures and funding profiles.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted the authorities’ strong and wide ranging policy response to the
economic challenges, which has helped strengthen market confidence. Directors underscored,
however, that downside risks still dominate and that unwinding imbalances and reallocating
resources across sectors will need the support of continued and decisive policy action.
Directors commended the authorities for the reconfiguration of the savings bank sector,
enhanced capital standards, and the greater transparency in individual bank exposures. They
also welcomed the wide participation of Spanish financial institutions in the recent EU stress
tests, and noted that the results highlight the importance of the backstop provided by the
authorities. In this regard, Directors agreed that decisive implementation of the reform strategy
for the financial sector is critical to allay lingering market concerns. Directors also saw scope for
further strengthening provisioning and capital buffers, and building on recent transparency
efforts.
Directors noted that an improved policy framework would facilitate the achievement of the fiscal
targets. They welcomed the authorities’ commitment to reduce the fiscal deficit, and the recent
enactment of pension reform. Directors emphasized that steadfast fiscal adjustment is key, and
noted that, if near-term risks to the outlook materialize, additional measures may be needed.
Noting the reliance of the adjustment on measures at the sub-national level, Directors urged all
levels of government to deliver on their fiscal commitments. They encourage the authorities to

3
be vigilant and consider further fiscal measures as needed to achieve medium-term targets and
put the debt ratio on a firmly declining path.
Directors recognized the authorities’ efforts to address entrenched rigidities in the labor market
and encouraged them to persevere with reforms to reduce the unacceptably high level of
unemployment. In particular, Directors called for more decentralized wage bargaining as well as
less indexation and further lowering severance payments.
Directors agreed that structural reforms in the non-tradable sector aimed at raising productivity
and the growth potential should complement labor market adjustments. In particular, priority
should be given to establishing a more efficient regulatory environment and further opening up
regulated professions and services.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
SPAIN
Staff Report for the Article IV Consultation—Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European Department
(In Consultation with Other Departments)
Approved by Ajai Chopra and Martin Mühleisen
July 19, 2011
This supplement provides information that has become available since the staff report was
issued. The new information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
The European Banking Authority (EBA) released the results of the EU-wide
stress test on July 15. The coverage of the Spanish system (93 percent) is, again,
commendably much higher than the EBA requirement of at least 50 percent, and 25 Spanish
institutions participated. The analysis incorporates measures through April 2011, including,
critically for the weaker institutions, existing and committed FROB support. The results
show 5 out of the 25 institutions as falling below the benchmark under the adverse scenario,
representing 9 percent of total banking assets and for a combined shortfall of €1.6 billion
(less than 0.2 percent of GDP). However, for comparability, some country specific balance
sheet elements, such as generic provisions and mandatory convertible bonds in Spain, were
not taken into account as loss-absorbing instruments. If they are, the Spanish authorities
indicate that no additional capital is required as a result of the exercise. In staff’s view, the
results underscore the importance of: the FROB capital backstop; the need to decisively
implement the envisaged financial sector reforms, in particular, swiftly addressing the few
small weak banks; and, in light of current market tension, further strengthening capital
buffers.

2.
The Bankia IPO was concluded on July 18. In the context of difficult market
conditions, the amount and price were lowered compared to the initial target ranges,
implying a substantial discount to book value. Nevertheless, slightly more than €3 billion
was raised, which, critically, means that there is no need to resort to FROB resources to meet
minimum capital standards. The share of institutional investors was 40 percent (reportedly,
mainly domestic), and half of Bankia’s capital would be held private investors.
3.
An expenditure rule has been enacted. The July 1 Royal Decree modifies the
budget stability law to include a rule for central and local governments to keep the increase in
nominal public expenditure (excluding interest and unemployment benefits) below the
growth in nominal GDP (defined as the average of the past 5 years, the estimate for the
current year, and projections for the next 3 years from the SGP). Its use by regional
governments will be discussed in the next meeting of the Fiscal and Financial Policy Council
(scheduled for July 27). Staff views an expenditure rule as a useful complement to the deficit
rule, which should be applied to all levels of government.
4.
The draft pension reform is scheduled for final approval by Congress on
Thursday, July 21.

Statement by Carlos Perez-Verdia, Executive Director for Spain and
Carmen Balsa, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
July 22, 2011
Spain has delivered in the context of a difficult structural re-balancing of the economy and
in spite of a challenging external environment. As staff underscores, the policy response
targets the main economic problems, in line with previous Article IV recommendations,
through a two-pronged approach: first, an ambitious fiscal strategy that builds on
accelerated consolidation and strengthens long-term sustainability of public finances;
second, a comprehensive structural reform agenda focused mainly on the financial sector
and the labor market. Despite strong headwinds and financial market spillovers throughout
the year the economy has proven resilient.
The authorities concur with staff on the need to maintain the reform momentum given
the remaining weaknesses, the still wobbly external picture, and the urgency of tackling
high unemployment.
The Spanish GDP stabilized in 2010 and the authorities expect growth to reach 1.3 percent in
2011. This modest recovery is consistent with the ongoing process of unwinding imbalances
and the major consolidation of public accounts. The reallocation of resources towards more
productive activities has continued and, although unemployment has increased, it is expected
to begin declining this year. The recovery is being led by the strong performance of exports.
The capacity of Spanish firms to increase their market share in less traditional markets—e.g.
BRICs, new EU member states, Turkey and MENA—and to diversify has been key. The
export base has widened in the last three years, as the number of companies exporting goods
increased by 12.6 percent. Unit labor costs have also contributed and will continue to do so in
the near future. Although recognizing the short-term uncertainties, the authorities see a more
dynamic medium-term macroeconomic outlook compared to that of staff, in particular its
estimates for export growth understate the improvement mentioned above and may therefore
continue to be too conservative. Moreover, the impact of structural reforms on potential GDP
will be significant when they take full effect; recent estimates by the authorities point to a
one percent increase by 2014 onwards.
The balance of risks to the outlook is perhaps more nuanced than stated in the report. On the
one hand, financial market spillovers have already resurfaced and will probably remain until
uncertainties in the European sovereign debt market subside. These add to funding pressures
that could become an additional hurdle for growth if they linger. On the other, the upside
could also be substantial in case financial markets return to more normal functioning and
spreads converge to levels more in line with fundamentals.

2
Authorities share the objectives of the policy agenda stated in the report and are committed to
full and strong implementation of the policy strategy. The report points to the stickiness of
“stock” problems as a concern. Yet, it is the rapid adjustment of flows which will set the
trend and stocks will gradually move to healthier levels as nominal GDP approaches a pace
consistent with potential. As an example, external debt as a percentage of GDP has shrunk
more than 7 points since the peak in the first quarter of 2010.
Fiscal strategy has already yielded in 2010. The General Government deficit ended up 0.1
percentage points below the Government's initial commitment (9.2 percent of GDP) and
public debt was 60.1 percent of GDP, 25 percentage points below the euro area average. The
structural fiscal adjustment for 2011 in Spain, an unconditional priority of economic policy,
will be the largest among major advanced economies, amounting to 2.7 points of GDP
according to the report. In the long run, the authorities are fully committed to comply with
the SGP target (a deficit of 3 percent of GDP in 2013 and 2.1 percent of GDP and a structural
primary surplus of 1 percent of GDP in 2014), and agree with the importance of early
achievement of the Medium-Term Objective of a balanced budget. Under staff´s macro
projections, the report foresees a stabilization of government debt to GDP at 70 percent in
2013, given the above mentioned SGP targets.
On staff’s concerns regarding consolidation at the sub-national levels, Autonomous
Communities and local governments have committed, through resolutions of the Fiscal and
Financial Policies Council, to meet the agreed fiscal targets. To ensure compliance, important
steps were taken in 2010 to strengthen the fiscal framework, although there is still margin for
improvement. A tighter and more frequent control system and greater transparency
requirements on public finances have been implemented. Moreover, a Royal Decree Law
st
issued on July 1 reinforces fiscal discipline by introducing a spending rule on Budgetary
Stability Laws, complementary to the current through-the-cycle budget balance rule. The
new spending rule applies directly to the central and local governments and the Government
will immediately promote its adoption by the Autonomous Communities. The Sustainable
Economy Law also incorporates measures to strengthen the co-responsibility of all public
authorities when facing EU sanctions, as well as mechanisms to ensure compliance with the
reporting requirements on budget implementation by local governments.
To strengthen the sustainability of public finances in the long term, a comprehensive reform
of the pension system was agreed with social partners and is expected to be finally approved
st
in Parliament on July 21 . The main pillars of this reform are: (i) an increase of the
statutory age of retirement to 67; (ii) a tightening of the conditions for access to partial and
early retirement; (iii) an extension of the period for calculating pension entitlement, from
the last 15 years to the last 25; and (iv) the introduction of a sustainability factor to update
the system parameters, every five years, according to changes in life expectancy. The report
considers this reform a landmark improvement which could cut pension expenditures up to
3 and a half percent of GDP by 2050 and raise potential output by 0.2–0.3 percent. The

3
Government has also introduced far-reaching measures to reduce health spending by
rationalizing the use of prescriptions, and increasing efficiency in the provision of health
services.
The authorities have proceeded steadfastly with the ambitious restructuring of the financial
sector. Moreover, transparency was further enhanced and capital requirements increased
under the February 2011 Royal Decree Law. Indeed, recent stress tests by the EBA show
the Spanish financial sector, once generic provisions are taken into account, is robust even
under very adverse scenarios. The 100 percent participation of Spanish banks and savings
banks in the exercise demonstrates their commitment to transparency to dispel any
remaining doubts.
In response to the weaknesses revealed by the crisis, the authorities set in motion an
unprecedented process of transformation, which will replace the old savings banks’ model by
modern commercial banks subject to full market discipline and capitalization mechanisms.
This transformation is aimed at enhancing the institutions’ competitive position and market
perception, while minimizing the cost to the taxpayer and avoiding distortions in the sector’s
functioning.
The first phase of this transformation process, which is almost complete, pursued an increase
in the sector’s efficiency through consolidation and restructuring. The results are remarkable:
(i) new entities’ solvency has been strengthened with €10.1 billion funds from the Fund for
Orderly Bank Restructuring (FROB); (ii) write-downs and provisions have been increased
(additional €22 billion provisions have been constituted by the entities that requested
FROB’s support), (iii) the number of entities has been reduced from 45 to 18, through
mergers and acquisitions, allowing the resulting institutions to benefit from lower operating
costs and improved access to wholesale markets; and (iv) excess capacity is being tackled by
cutting, on average, 25 percent of branches and 15 percent of staff.
The second phase of the process aims at improving governance, increasing obligations on
transparency—already very high by all measures—and reinforcing solvency and capital
quality requirements. In a nutshell, beyond EBA’s thresholds, the new regulation requires a
capital principal1 ratio of at least 8 percent of risk-weighted-assets, by end-September. For
those entities considered heavily dependent on wholesale markets (20 percent threshold) this
ratio is increased to 10 percent. The FROB will, if necessary, subscribe the banks’ shares to
allow compliance with the new capital requirements. It is foreseen that only four savings
banks—representing eight percent of total assets of the Spanish banking system—will
require this support. FROB’s interventions will be, according to law, temporary, market
based, and backed by a demanding restructuring plan approved by Banco de España, the EC
1

Capital principal = core capital + convertible preference shares subscribed by FROB + debt instruments
mandatorily convertible into common shares before end-2014.

4
and the FROB itself. Furthermore, these plans will be independently audited by renowned
international firms.
The restructuring of the financial sector is approaching completion. It has repaired previous
flaws and strengthens institutions looking forward—for instance, by providing more
information and building buffers and backstops—in a still uncertain environment. However,
there is no complacency on the side of authorities. They remain aware of the risks and will
ensure the achievement of targets, both by adopting the necessary measures and by ensuring
market discipline is allowed to work fully.
Staff adequately describes the traditional problems of duality and inflexibility of the Spanish
labor market, which, together with the downsizing of the residential real estate sector, led to
a severe quantity adjustment during the crisis. Reform momentum in this difficult area has
also been strong over last year. With the ultimate aim of removing the burden on growth of
an inefficient labor market, initiatives have fostered the use of permanent and training
contracts and clarified grounds for objective dismissal. More recently, relevant changes have
been introduced in the collective bargaining framework. Their objective is to ease the process
and reduce remaining rigidities by incentivizing bargaining at the company level, linking
agreements to economic conditions, encouraging prompt and swift renegotiation, and making
opt-out clauses more available.
Admittedly, there is more to be done and the authorities are already working on further
improvements, in many cases along the lines proposed by staff. Nevertheless, reforms in the
labor market accomplished so far constitute very important steps to improve Spain’s potential
growth.
Additional structural measures have been adopted in other areas. Among them, the full
transposition of the European Service Directive stands out in terms of foreseen productivity
gains and reduction of administrative burdens. The Sustainable Economy Law, enacted last
March, also introduces far-reaching improvements in competitiveness-related fields, such as
the economic environment, innovation, education and the energy mix. Airport management
and state lotteries are being revamped through a process that includes a modern regulatory
framework, the introduction of private management systems, and partial privatization of
previous public monopolies. Finally, the telecommunications sector regulation is also being
improved in order to achieve a more efficient use of the spectrum by reallocating and
auctioning parts of that spectrum.
In conclusion, in a very difficult year, Spain has laid the ground for a new growth model; a
more sustainable, higher productivity model, which delivers the level of flexibility required
in a monetary union. Despite these achievements, authorities recognize there is no room for
complacency and it is crucial to maintain the reform momentum with the overarching goals
of fostering growth and creating employment.
