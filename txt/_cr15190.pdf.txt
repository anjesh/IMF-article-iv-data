IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Lebanon
On June 26, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Lebanon.
The conflict in Syria, now in its fifth year, dominates Lebanon’s outlook, with refugees now
comprising over one-quarter of the population. The refugee crisis is straining local
communities, adding to poverty and unemployment, and placing further pressure on the
economy’s already-weak public finances and infrastructure. Moreover, Lebanon faces a difficult
domestic political situation. The presidency has been vacant since May 2014 and a lack of
consensus between the major parties is hindering passage of key legislation.
In the face of this uncertainty, growth remains subdued. Following a sharp drop in 2011, growth
has crawled upward to about 2–3 percent but remains well short of potential. IMF staff estimate
that GDP increased by only 2 percent in 2014 and project a similarly modest growth rate in 2015.
Lebanon’s traditional growth drivers—tourism, real estate, and construction—have received a
significant blow and a strong rebound is unlikely soon. Lebanon’s return to potential growth
(4 percent) before 2019 is now doubtful. Inflation also declined sharply in 2014 on the back of
lower oil prices and other one-off factors, but should return to about 3 percent by end-2015.
On the fiscal side, exceptional factors allowed for a primary surplus in 2014, but without
decisive action fiscal deterioration will continue in 2015. The 2014 primary surplus of about
2.5 percent of GDP largely resulted from exceptional telecom transfers and, to some extent, from
withheld and delayed payments. But the primary balance is expected to return to a deficit of
almost 1.25 percent of GDP in 2015, with public debt remaining high at 132 percent of GDP.
Foreign-exchange and financial markets continue to be resilient, despite Lebanon’s sizable
external financial requirements. Inflows remain large, particularly from non-resident deposits;
and in the context of Lebanon’s currency peg to the U.S. dollar, the Banque du Liban (BdL) has
maintained an adequate level of gross foreign exchange reserves.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities for preserving macroeconomic stability and
market confidence despite the unprecedented humanitarian and economic spillovers from the
conflict in Syria, including a daunting inflow of refugees which has taken a toll on public
finances, infrastructures, and the social fabric. Against this background, they called on the
international community to provide greater humanitarian and development assistance to
Lebanon. While acknowledging that a very difficult economic and political context limits
feasible policy choices, Directors encouraged the authorities to further strengthen confidence and
secure more inclusive growth by implementing priority fiscal and structural reforms promptly.
Directors stressed that a sustained fiscal adjustment is essential. They welcomed the primary
surplus in 2014, but noted that it mostly reflected one-off factors. They cautioned that, without
further adjustment, the public debt ratio will continue to rise and add to existing vulnerabilities,
crowding out essential public investment and social spending. As a first step, Directors
encouraged the authorities to pass an appropriately ambitious budget for 2015. They also stressed
the urgent need to reform the electricity sector to remove a large drain on the public finances.
More broadly, Directors underscored the need to place public indebtedness on a sustainable
downward path. In this context, they advised caution in implementing a salary-scale adjustment
for public-sector employees. They pointed to significant scope to increase revenue equitably,
including by improving compliance and broadening the tax base, starting with fuel taxation.
Further, Directors observed that changing the spending mix toward capital and social spending
would help mitigate the procyclical impact of fiscal adjustment. They also considered that
strengthening the safety nets and reforming the pension system could improve equity and fiscal
sustainability.
Directors commended the central bank for supporting macroeconomic stability and maintaining
adequate international reserves. They agreed that monetary policy should remain geared to
supporting the U.S. dollar peg, which has served Lebanon well. Looking ahead, they underscored
that fiscal adjustment would help reduce the financial and institutional burden on the central
bank related to quasi-fiscal activities.
Directors noted the critical role played by Lebanon’s banking system in securing sustained,
broad-based economic growth. They commended the authorities’ close oversight of the financial
system, and stressed the need for continued vigilance and efforts to strengthen the regulatory
framework. They highlighted the importance of increasing capital buffers, improving loan
classification and restructuring rules, and further enhancing the framework to counter money

laundering and terrorism financing. Directors welcomed the authorities’ recent request for an
update assessment under the Financial Sector Assessment Program.
Directors underscored the need to advance structural reforms to promote job creation and
improve competitiveness. In addition to electricity reform, which is a critical priority, Directors
highlighted the need for labor reforms, improvements in public service provision, and legislation
to reinvigorate private investment, including in the oil and gas sector. Directors also encouraged
the authorities to improve Lebanon’s statistical system, building on ongoing progress.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 11, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Context. The Syrian crisis and the associated inflow of refugees continue to dominate
Lebanon’s short-term outlook, compounding long-standing policy weaknesses and
vulnerabilities. Political paralysis has set in, with virtually no progress on the structural
front. Growth has remained modest and insufficient to make a dent in rising poverty and
unemployment. A welcome improvement in the primary fiscal position in 2014 was
largely due to temporary factors, and will not be sustained absent adjustment efforts—
implying that, without additional effort, Lebanon’s already-sizable public debt burden
will only worsen. Financial conditions have nonetheless remained stable, as deposit
inflows continue to fund the economy and sizeable buffers support the credibility of the
exchange rate peg.
Policy priorities. Policies should aim at restoring fiscal sustainability and securing
inclusive growth, to help engineer a soft-landing to a stronger economy. While
Lebanon’s macrofinancial structure has, historically, held up well in the face of past
turmoil, certain features remain a source of considerable vulnerabilities. Continued
oversight of the financial system will be instrumental in containing them.
Key recommendations. While difficult political conditions make major reforms difficult,
action could be taken now in two important areas: (i) passing a budget for 2015—the
first in a decade, as a signal that the fiscal situation is under control; and (ii) starting
well-known reforms in the electricity sector, which remains a major impediment to
improved productivity, competitiveness, growth, and equity.


Over the short term, the authorities should look beyond the temporary impact of
lower oil prices and deliver a credible policy mix with sustained adjustment and a
falling public debt ratio. Revenue measures should be broad-based, starting from
increases in fuel taxation; while spending composition should move away from
transfers to the electricity company toward capital projects and social programs.
Fiscal adjustment would also reduce the financial and institutional burden on the
Banque du Liban and ultimately promote interest rate flexibility.



Over the medium term, social stability requires job-rich and sustainable growth.
Continued efforts to ensure a sound financial system will support this objective,
along with structural reforms to improve competitiveness and equity, starting from
Lebanon’s pension schemes.

CONTEXT: POLICY INERTIA…
1.
Lebanon has a reputation of living close to the edge. In the past, it has weathered
significant shocks, sustained macroeconomic imbalances even wider than those currently
experienced, with political dynamics often preventing a more strategic approach to addressing
underlying vulnerabilities.
2.
But this time may be different. The Syria crisis—now in its fifth year—represents one of
the worst humanitarian crises since the Second World War, and is the key determinant of Lebanon’s
short-term outlook and longer-term prospects (Box 1). The number of refugees has steadied, partly
as a result of tighter border restrictions. But they nonetheless comprise over one-quarter of the
population, straining local communities, adding to poverty and unemployment, and placing further
pressure on Lebanon’s already-weak public finances and infrastructure. The authorities have
stepped forward and should be commended for hosting the refugees, but they cannot shoulder this
overwhelming burden alone. International support has helped, but remains insufficient given the
sheer scale of Lebanon’s humanitarian and development needs.
3.
The country is in the grip of a protracted political crisis. The presidency has been vacant
since May 2014, and parliament lacks sufficient consensus to convene to discuss key legislation.
Without a president, cabinet can still enact legislation, but only if agreed unanimously by all
24 ministers—which is very difficult given the current political fissures. Parliament’s term was
recently extended (for a second time) to June 2017, adding to concerns as to its legitimacy. In this
environment, a few targeted policy actions would send a strong signal about the country’s will and
determination to move forward despite the many challenges ahead.
4.
Growth has decelerated significantly.
Following a crash from 8 percent in 2010 to less
than 1 percent in 2011, growth has inched upward
to around 2–3 percent, but remains well short of its
potential. Inflation also declined sharply in 2014,
owing to lower oil prices and a number of
additional one-off developments, but is expected to
return to a trend rate of about 3 percent in 2015. In
this regard, lower CPI inflation has essentially offset
the recent appreciation of the Lebanese pound
(pegged to the U.S. dollar), leaving Lebanon’s real
effective exchange rate broadly unchanged.

Rising uncertainty is taking a toll on the economy, but incomes and consumption are
receiving a temporary boost from lower oil prices. Lebanon’s traditional growth sectors—tourism,
real estate, and construction—have all taken a significant blow, and a strong rebound is unlikely in
the immediate future. Indeed, early indications for 2015 point to a marked softening of the
construction sector, particularly for high-end residential projects. However, the pass-through

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LEBANON

of global oil prices to local fuel prices is relatively high in Lebanon, so the recent drop in global prices
will boost local incomes (Box 2). Remittance inflows, a significant portion of which come from
oil-exporting Gulf countries, have been stable in the face of volatile oil prices. Projections also
suggest that activity in key oil exporting countries will remain steady, as financial buffers are
expected to cushion any adverse impact on growth. Taking all these factors into account, staff
estimate Lebanon’s GDP growth at about 2 percent in 2014 (slightly less than the previous year)
and project a similarly modest rate for 2015.1 Looking further forward, staff have also scaled back
their medium-term projections. Domestic demand will remain relatively subdued from 2016 onward
and the economy’s medium-term recovery will be driven mostly by the normalization of broader
global conditions. Thus, Lebanon’s return to potential growth (4 percent) is now unlikely before 2019.

Exceptional factors allowed for a welcome primary surplus in 2014, but without
decisive action fiscal deterioration is set to resume in 2015. At an unexpected 2½ percent of
GDP, the 2014 primary surplus largely resulted from unusually high telecom transfers (part of
which, estimated at about 1 percent of GDP, will be transferred to municipalities in 2015), the
non-implementation of a much-awaited salary increase for the public sector, and, to some extent,
withheld and delayed payments.2 Without a repetition of these one-off factors, staff project that the
primary balance will likely deteriorate to almost 1¼ percent of GDP in 2015, with public debt
remaining at 132 percent of GDP, very high by international standards (Annex I).

National accounts data are only available with a long lag and are subject to significant revisions. Staff “nowcasting”
estimates are based on recent movements across a range of high-frequency indicators.

These factors largely explain the significantly better performance in 2014 compared to that expected at the time of
the 2014 Article IV Consultation.

Box 1. The Prolonged Impact of the Syrian Refugee Crisis

The Syrian crisis is now entering its fifth year. According to the United Nations High Commission for
Refugees (UNHCR), the number of Syrian refugees exceeded 1.4 million in January 2015. Combined with an
estimated 0.4 million Palestinians already in Lebanon, refugees now exceed one third of Lebanon’s total
resident population. And looking ahead, UNCHR expects the number of Syrian refugees will surpass
1.8 million by the end of the year.
Although all parties agree that such a number of refugees is unsustainable, there are few quantitative
estimates of their economic impact.
 The authorities’ have been clearly confronted with rising healthcare, education, electricity, and security
costs, and the quality of public-service provision has suffered. But to date, the only comprehensive costing
comes from a 2013 study led by the World Bank, which estimated the direct fiscal impact of the crisis over
2012–14 at $2.6 billion (5½ percent of GDP).1 It also suggested that restoring public-service provision to
pre-crisis levels would require an additional $2.5 billion. These results remain the most reliable assessment
of the crisis’ fiscal cost.
 As for the broader macroeconomic impact of the crisis, a recent UNDP study2 estimated the multiplier
associated with humanitarian aid at around 1.6. Thus, while the (net) impact of the crisis has clearly been
negative, aid inflows in 2014 added 1.3 percent to overall GDP growth.
 The social costs of the crisis have also been significant. Poverty in Lebanon has increased by 4 percentage
points to 32 percent; the labor force has risen by an estimated 50 percent compared to 2011; and income
inequality has widened, as Syrian refugees accept much lower wages than Lebanese workers.3

Box 1. The Prolonged Impact of the Syrian Refugee Crisis (concluded)
A comprehensive strategy is yet to be put in place. As a matter of policy, Lebanon has long maintained
that it is not a country of asylum, a final destination for refugees, or a country of resettlement. But there is
no consensus on the best way to curb the inflows or deal with existing refugees—memories about Palestinian
refugee camps have prevented the consideration of organized settlements or any measure that might allude
to a permanent presence. After a long delay, the authorities adopted a policy paper in October 2014
focusing on three broad principles: (i) reducing the number of individuals registered in Lebanon as displaced;
(ii) addressing local security concerns; and (iii) sharing the burden of the crisis by expanding the humanitarian
response to include local communities and infrastructure. It also encouraged relocation to safe areas in
Syria, or for third countries to offer more resettlement opportunities. As part of this policy, the authorities
have tightened border-control requirements; and registrations of new refugees are now down to around
10,000 per month, compared to around 30,000 per month prior to October 2014.
Humanitarian support has been substantial, though more is needed and on a sustained basis.
Humanitarian assistance, directly targeting the refugees and the agencies working with them, exceeded
$1 billion in 2013 and almost reached that level in 2014. While sizable, donor support has not covered
increasing needs. Most visibly, the World Food Program

trends, the WFP will have to suspend the program in the
summer, leaving many refugees without food assistance.
The emphasis of donor support is shifting from humanitarian to development aid. In December 2014,
the government and UNDP launched the Lebanon Crisis Response Plan (LCRP)—a 2-year stabilization and
development plan that targets 1.5 million refugees while also including 1.9 million vulnerable Lebanese.
Unlike the previous year’s plan, which focused primarily on humanitarian relief, approximately one-third of
the LCRP will address Lebanese stabilization/development needs. So far, of the $2.14 billion required under
the plan, only some $400 million has been made available. The Third International Humanitarian Pledging
Conference for Syria (Kuwait III), held at end-March 2015, led to pledges of $3.8 billion to fund the Regional
Refugee and Resilience Plan 2015–16 (which includes the LCRP). While these are significant amounts, actual
disbursements may once again disappoint.

Box 2. Can Nominal GDP Increase with Falling Prices and Stagnant Growth?
Despite weak growth and falling prices, Lebanon’s nominal GDP is rising. Staff have recently scaled back
their real GDP growth estimates, amidst falling inflation (actually negative at end-2014). But nominal GDP
projections have actually increased. So why is nominal GDP rising so rapidly? The answer stems from the
relationship between two commonly used measures of inflation—the consumer price index (CPI) and the GDP
deflator.
The CPI and deflator typically move together, but not always. Indeed, there may be occasions when
they provide very different pictures of inflation. The discrepancy often stems from movements in a country’s
terms of trade, i.e. the ratio of export prices to import prices. Essentially, the CPI basket includes imports,
but not exports; whereas the GDP deflator includes exports, but not imports. So, if the prices of these two
trade-related items move in different directions, the gap between the CPI and the deflator may be significant.
To gauge the size of the gap, it is useful to note that:
GDP deflator = "Domestic prices"

export prices

import prices

where α and β are the relative importance of exports and imports, respectively, as a proportion of GDP. If
Lebanon’s terms of trade improve—either through rising export prices or falling import prices—then the
deflator will tend to rise faster than the CPI. And as a result, nominal GDP will grow relatively quickly;
reflecting the fact that Lebanon is effectively wealthier.
Looking forward, nominal GDP is projected to grow rapidly in 2015. WEO projections imply a significant
improvement in Lebanon’s terms of trade in 2015, owing in large part to the recent drop in oil (import) prices,
but reflecting also the strengthening U.S. dollar. These factors will boost nominal GDP growth, despite
subdued consumer prices and modest real growth.

7.
There has been virtually no progress on
structural reforms. There have been long delays in
electricity reforms and enhancing social safety nets.
Policy inertia has also prevented the development of
offshore gas fields—as the bidding process for
exploration has been repeatedly delayed, with decrees
on field delineation and an Exploration and Production
Agreement still pending and the Petroleum Tax Law yet
to be passed by parliament. On a positive note, the
publication of a quarterly T-bill calendar and updated
public debt strategy are welcome (Box 3).

recent data revisions, the current account deficit is
estimated at around 25 percent of GDP in 2014 (see Annex II). This is a clear source of vulnerability,
particularly in light of the peg to the U.S. dollar. Nonetheless, foreign inflows continue to grow, and
have allowed the Banque du Liban (BdL) to maintain an adequate level of gross reserves, which

stood at around $38 billion as of end-March 2015 (107
percent of the Fund’s composite metric). In this regard,
the exchange-rate peg remains a key anchor for
confidence and stability, and continues to serve the
economy well. Lebanese Eurobond spreads have
generally moved in line with regional peers, and
are broadly at pre-crisis levels (400 bps). Indeed, in
February, a $2.2 billion Eurobond issue by the Treasury—
the largest so far—was significantly oversubscribed.
Nonetheless, S&P maintained the rating unchanged at Blevel in March 2015, warning about potential downside
risks.

Box 3. Policies Since the 2014 Article IV Consultation
The 2014 consultation called for fiscal discipline, by restoring a primary surplus and reducing the public
debt-to-GDP ratio. The authorities managed to achieve a primary surplus, but mostly through one-off measures
including: sizeable transfers from the telecom company, non-implementation of a salary increase for the public
sector, under-spending on capital projects, and flat social and other current spending. Excises on gasoline were
minimally increased, but more could have been done in light of the recent large drop in oil prices. In line with staff
advice, the BdL decreased rates on CDs across the full spectrum of longer maturities to encourage banks to invest
in long-term T-bill issuances.
The 2014 consultation also stressed the importance of continued efforts to strengthen bank regulation and
supervision, as well as the balanced development of capital markets. On the former, the authorities have
continued their efforts and have recently requested an FSAP update. On the latter, the Capital Markets Authority
(CMA) continued apace to issue regulations and took over a part of supervision from the BdL, which staff welcome.
There was minimal progress on structural reforms. The 2014 consultation highlighted the need for structural
reforms toward more inclusive growth and economic resilience, especially in light of the prolonged presence of
Syrian refugees and the resulting pressures on Lebanon’s fiscal accounts, infrastructure capacity, social fabric and
labor markets. Staff underlined the need to implement electricity reform to improve service provision and reduce
the EdL’s drain on the budget, embark on strengthening social safety nets, and re-activate the legislative process
to pass pending legislation. On the positive side, staff welcomed the Ministry of Finance’s initiative to publish for
the first time a quarterly T-bill issuance calendar regularizing long-term issuances, and an updated public debt
strategy. Parliament’s agreement to pass a law allowing for new Eurobond issuances was also a positive step. The
authorities also embarked on anti-corruption campaigns in the health sector and at customs. Reform progress in
other areas is still very slow. The provision of statistical information has generally remained weak, with longer
delays and an increasing lack of cooperation and coordination among various agencies (Box 6).

Lebanon’s unique macro-financial structure is a source of resilience, but also of key
risks. With aggregate assets exceeding 350 percent of GDP, the Lebanese banking sector is one of
the largest in the world and the largest in the MENA region as a share of GDP. Banks attract
substantial deposits from both residents and nonresidents, including from Lebanon’s large overseas
diaspora. And they play a crucial role in channeling

Credit to the nonfinancial private sector has
grown by about 9 percent per year over 2013–14,
faster than nominal output. As a result, the private
sector credit-to-GDP ratio increased from 86 to
91 percent over the same period, in part driven by
three BdL stimulus packages totaling $3.4 billion.
While this might otherwise be a cause for concern,
standard metrics such as the “credit gap” (the
deviation of credit-to-GDP from its long-run
trend) suggest that, based on Lebanon’s past
experience, risks to financial stability are not
currently out of line.

At the same time, the BdL has introduced new macroprudential measures to contain the
build-up of risk, tightening provisioning rules for retail loans and imposing new restrictions on
lending to households, in the form of lower loan-to-value ratios and debt-service-to-income
ratios.



Private sector leverage appears contained. Leverage is not a pressing worry for Lebanese banks,
as the system’s leverage ratio (at 6.5 percent) is well above Basel III’s minimum requirement of
3 percent. Similarly, household indebtedness is reasonable, at around 44 percent of household
income. However, there is little available data on non-financial corporate leverage.



Risks could arise following a sharper downturn
of the real estate market. A sizable fraction of
bank loans to the private sector have been
directed at the real estate sector, where activity
is softening. But, in the absence of a price index,
the number and value of property sales can
serve as a proxy for the housing cycle. Both
indicators grew by close to 3 percent in 2014.
This is slightly more than the 2009–14 average
for the number of transactions, but well below
the past average for the value of sold properties
(around 11 percent).

11.
Nonetheless, the structure of Lebanon’s
financial system, and the tight nexus between
banks and the sovereign, make the economy
dependent on the confidence of non-resident
depositors. As noted above, deposit inflows are the
key source of funding for the economy. These
inflows have been resilient, including in the face of
financial- and commodity-market volatility.
Deposit growth has decelerated over recent years—
but at 7–8 percent, it has remained sufficient to cover
Lebanon’s (public and external) financing needs and
to maintain the current international reserve buffer.
However, risks from a further escalation of regional
conflict (or other external events) are exceptionally high,
and could lead to a negative and potentially protracted
investor response.
12.
Spillovers from the Syria crisis pose the most
serious threat to the economy. Under the baseline,
staff assume that the conflict in Syria will begin to ease
toward the end of 2016; at which point confidence will
come back and growth will gradually return to
potential—a modest 4 percent. Thus, in contrast to the
recent past, when high GDP growth helped contain
Lebanon’s imbalances, subdued growth over the

foreseeable future will likely remain too low to stabilize debt, create jobs, or address the country’s
deepening social tensions. On the (so far unlikely) upside, however, if the crisis in Syria were to be
resolved, Lebanon would be in a unique position to assist in its reconstruction, with significant and
positive implications for local incomes and growth.
13.
Downside risks associated with the Syrian crisis are exceptionally high. In addition, two
key risks also loom large (see Risk Assessment Matrix):


Continued fiscal deterioration due to political stalemate and entrenched social tensions. In the
face of social pressures and refugee needs, the authorities may postpone fiscal adjustment as
politically too difficult. Any such course would further increase public debt, possibly leading to
financing pressures and lower investor confidence. This could, in turn, quickly spread into the
macro-financial sphere—triggering lower deposits, higher financing costs, deteriorating bank
finances, mounting exchange-rate pressures, and falling reserves.



Stalled structural reforms. Continued erosion of already weak infrastructure, and further
disappointments, especially on the electricity front—compounded by the pressures from the
refugee presence—could further weaken growth and competitiveness. This would have a direct
impact on Lebanon’s already-adverse debt dynamics and social stability (with a longer-term
feedback loop on domestic security).

Authorities’ views
14.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment of risks. They viewed
developments in the region, most notably the crisis in Syria, as the main risk to security and
relatedly, macroeconomic stability. They continued to believe that, although the international
community had helped, it had done too little to allow Lebanon to deal adequately with the tragedy
of the refugees, and that much more was needed to stem a crisis that transcended national and
regional borders.
15.
They were less concerned about spillovers from global financial market volatility and
increased interest rates. They noted that, in the past, the pass-through from dollar to domestic
interest rates had been gradual and incomplete, and that Lebanon would manage as long as a
sufficiently large differential vis-à-vis dollar rates was maintained.
16.
They shared staff’s assessment on the key role of continued deposit inflows. However,
they underscored that, as the stock of deposits grows larger, less emphasis should be put on the
growth rate per se rather than on the absolute size of the inflows, which continued to be sufficient
to fund the economy. A slowdown in itself was not a pressing concern and was to be expected,
given the domestic and regional outlook.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to

materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline
(“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a
probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the
time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
17.
Lebanon needs to take action. Over the short term, the key challenge will be to articulate
a coherent policy mix, starting immediately with credible adjustment to restore fiscal sustainability.
Over the longer term, social stability requires job-rich, sustainable growth that benefits all, which
cannot happen without a more inclusive macroeconomic environment and structural reform. These
two themes—ushering in a more balanced policy mix and laying the ground for higher and more
inclusive growth—featured prominently in the 2015 Consultation.

A. A More Balanced Policy Mix
18.
The need for fiscal adjustment is inescapable. Without it, and in the context of Lebanon’s
slowing growth and rising global interest rates, public debt will increase. Similarly, without
adjustment, government financing needs will continue to rise; the underlying codependence
between banks and the sovereign will intensify; and Lebanon’s reliance on deposit inflows will grow
larger, exposing the economy even more to sudden swings in depositors’ confidence. On all these
counts, delayed adjustment will simply exacerbate Lebanon’s underlying vulnerabilities.
19.
The case for fiscal adjustment is also grounded in
fairness. Without it and with ever more debt, interest
payments will soar to some 12 percent of GDP, or about
40 percent of total spending, crowding out essential social
programs and infrastructure projects and largely benefitting
public debt holders at the expense of the less-privileged. Thus
lack of fiscal adjustment is also costly and inequitable.

Yet, on current policies fiscal sustainability will
remain elusive. Under the baseline scenario, staff assume that
the salary scale adjustment for the public sector will be

rate (from 15 to 17 percent); the introduction of a capital gains
tax on real estate; an increase in the tax rate on interest income (from 5 to 7 percent); and new
stamp duties and fees. However, while the proposed package generates moderate primary
surpluses, it would not be sufficient to tackle Lebanon’s deteriorating debt dynamics. As a result,
debt is projected to reach 143 percent of GDP by 2020, with its trajectory subject to significant
downside risks (Annex I).

3

While the salary increase is subject to uncertainty, in the ongoing political debate it is clearly linked to the
adoption of (partially) compensating revenue measures. Staff projections assume that the salary increase will be
implemented as of January 1, 2015, while the revenue measures will become effective as of January 1, 2016.

14

21.
So fiscal adjustment is essential to restore
sustainability. Staff’s proposed strategy seeks to
achieve a number of objectives: (i) deliver a sustained
reduction in the public debt ratio, by targeting primary
surpluses comfortably above the debt-stabilizing level of
2.3 percent of GDP (Annex I); (ii) promote more fair fiscal
policies, by targeting a broad-based increase in taxation;
and (iii) mitigate the procyclical impact of fiscal
adjustment, by increasing productive spending (see
adjustment scenario in text chart). More specifically:

There is scope to increase taxation in a fair manner
across all economic sectors, including by broadening

According to staff analysis, Lebanon’s tax
capacity remains largely under-utilized;4 and
while ongoing efforts by the ministry of finance
to tighten tax collections (including through
better enforcement and oversight, especially of
VAT refund claims) are welcome, more is
needed. Staff endorsed the authorities’ planned
measures (with the caveat that double taxation
on incomes be avoided); 5 however, it cautioned
against optimistic yield projections. It also called
for a modest increase in the VAT rate by one
percentage point, to 11 percent.

time to remove the VAT exemption on diesel introduced in 2012 and increase gasoline excises,
significantly reduced in 2011. Such increases will also promote a more efficient use of fuel
products and mitigate the costs of pollution and congestion (Box 4).

4

Lebanon’s tax effort (defined as the ratio of a country’s actual tax revenue to its maximum tax capacity) is
estimated at only 50 percent; i.e., at maximum effort, Lebanon might be able to double tax revenues to around
30 percent of GDP.

Banks can currently credit withheld taxes on interest income against their income tax liabilities—in line with
international standards. This provision should be preserved when rates are increased.

politically unacceptable, acting as shockabsorbers to offset movements in international prices. But once taxes are lowered, it then becomes
difficult to increase them when conditions change.
But lower fuel taxes may not be the best policy. First, revenue losses have been significant (the cost of
the VAT exemption on diesel was originally estimated at some ½ percent of GDP, but consumption has
increased since 2012 in line with the growing refugee presence, suggesting that losses are probably
larger). Second, the gains associated by implicitly subsidizing road transport are not distributed fairly: by
income, the poorest 20 percent of the population receives only 6 percent of the subsidy, while the richest
20 percent receives 55 percent.1 Finally, low fuel taxes are not efficient. Setting fuel prices (inclusive of
taxes) at an artificially low level encourages over-consumption, and adds to negative externalities—namely
global environmental damage, and local air pollution, congestion, accidents, and roadway wear and tear.
Higher fuel taxes could lead to improved public health, lower environmental costs, less congestion,
and more efficient fuel use. In setting the optimal tax level, consideration should be given to the
complete set of social externalities associated with fuel use. And while the chief goal is to align private and
social costs, rather than raise revenue, corrective taxes would also serve as a much needed source of
funding for the government, given Lebanon’s pressing fiscal consolidation needs.
There is ample scope to increase fuel taxation in Lebanon. An optimal-pricing tool prepared by the
IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department2 suggests that, at minimum, the level of excises on gasoline should be
increased and the VAT on diesel should be re-instated. Though politically difficult, these measures could
be framed as part of a broader set of steps to ensure that fiscal adjustment is as growth-friendly and
equitable as possible—indeed,



Telecom transfers should be managed transparently. Staff noted that their ad-hoc nature
hampered proper cash management and called for a system of regular transfers.



The state-owned Electricité du Liban (EdL) should urgently be placed on a sound financial footing
to reduce the need for government transfers. Staff noted that low oil prices have created some
fiscal space, but that they cannot be relied upon to contain future transfers. Ideally, transfers
should be eliminated. Staff therefore renewed calls for a comprehensive reform of the electricity
sector (see next section). Ultimately, as service provision is improved, tariffs (unchanged since
1993) should be increased toward cost recovery levels while protecting lower-income
consumers.



The salary scale adjustment should be implemented only if funded by credible revenue measures,
phased in gradually and without retroactive payments. Staff underscored that it should be
accompanied by steps toward comprehensive public-sector reform, such as lengthening
working hours from 32 to 35 a week and capping overtime and benefits, to ensure that public
servants are adequately remunerated based on their productivity.6 However, staff also noted
that the salary debate had drawn attention away from the more pressing need for fiscal
adjustment, and that fully funding the salary increases—the primary focus of ongoing political
discussions—would do nothing to reduce the budget deficit, but would instead add pressures
to already unsustainable public pension schemes (see below).

These measures were part of the original salary-scale proposal but later abandoned.

resulting in a more growth-friendly fiscal package.



Finally, delaying payments is a clearly suboptimal way to compress spending and should be
avoided. Although data are not available, staff noted that the frequently reported increase in
delayed payments is not a lasting strategy to reduce the budget deficit. It could also result in
future government obligations and further weaken economic activity.

22.
Passing a credible budget—the first in a decade—remains a critical priority. Staff
reiterated that it would provide a tangible and credible sign of reform commitment.
23.
Sustained fiscal adjustment will also reduce Lebanon’s reliance on foreign deposit
inflows—and thus reduce rollover risks. Banks hold over half of Lebanon’s T-bills and
Eurobonds, funded primarily by deposits, with a sizable portion coming from non-resident inflows.8
And banks have a strong incentive to continue financing the government as long as they have
enough liquidity. Staff noted that current buffers are sufficient to sustain a temporary decline in
deposit growth, though a sustained decline in deposit inflows could jeopardize banks’ ability to
finance the government.9

7

In addition to raising the VAT rate (a one percentage point rate increase would yield ½ percent of GDP), increased
revenue could also be generated by broadening tax bases and strengthening compliance.
8

Nonresident deposits account for about 23 percent of total deposits. But depositors are only considered
nonresidents if they do not have a Lebanese address. As a large part of Lebanon’s diaspora owns real estate in the
country, staff’s assessment suggests that the nonresident deposit share could be larger.
9

Staff estimate that a 1 percentage-point reduction in deposit inflow growth would require 2½ percent of GDP in
fiscal adjustment, other things equal.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LEBANON

24.
Fiscal adjustment would reduce the financial—and institutional—burden on the BdL.
The key priority of the BdL has, appropriately, been to build up Lebanon’s foreign exchange (FX)
reserve buffers, given the central role of the peg as a nominal anchor. To this effect, the BdL has
been channeling FX resources from the banking system into international reserves. Over the past
couple of years, however, some of these funds have also been used to meet the FX needs of the
government. At the same time, the BdL has also played a growing role in the allocation of credit to
the private sector, by introducing subsidized schemes—accounting for about 20 percent of total
outstanding loans and close to 75 percent of housing loans in 2014. Staff called for a gradual
withdrawal from such quasi-fiscal schemes, allowing old subsidized credit schemes to expire. All
these operations have taken a toll on the BdL’s income position. Looking forward, there is a need to
gradually strengthen the BdL’s balance sheet.10
25.
Finally, fiscal adjustment would allow for more market-determined interest rates. Staff
noted that the BdL, at times, has helped finance the government by offering well-remunerated term
deposits to banks in local currency, and channeling the proceeds to cover shortfalls in the T-bill
market. As a result, the BdL has been effectively managing short- and medium-term T-Bill yields
(unchanged since 2012) by using rates on its own CDs as a key signal. While financial conditions do
not appear excessively loose or tight (Box 5), staff underscored that unchanging interest rates tend
to dampen market signals, potentially distorting resource allocation and hindering market
development. It therefore recommended that, as fiscal adjustment takes hold, the BdL should scale
back its role as intermediary between banks and the sovereign, paving the way for more marketbased benchmark T-bill yields.

Authorities’ views
26.
The authorities agreed that reducing the debt ratio is the main priority. They noted
however that the political environment is extremely difficult, as shown by the protracted debate on
the 2015 budget. While there was general consensus around the need to tackle well-known
issues—such as reforms of electricity and civil service—concrete steps were unlikely. At the same
time, they acknowledged that even small steps could have high impact as a signal of political
action. Views remained split on the salary adjustment package, with some underscoring the need to
bring hiring under control and adopting differentiated salary scale increases for different categories
of public sector. At the same time, some noted that higher salaries were needed to secure a more
decent living for public servants, and to mitigate corruption; while others were of the view that such
increases cannot be afforded now.
27.
The authorities also welcomed the emphasis on growth and fairness. They appreciated
that, in contrast with past advice, staff was no longer recommending a VAT rate increase up to
15 percent, which they had viewed as regressive and politically unacceptable. They welcomed the

Fund’s ongoing technical assistance on boosting tax capacity through broadening tax bases and
strengthening compliance, which would help spread the burden of adjustment.
28.
There was broad agreement on the need to rebalance the policy mix to lighten the
burden placed on the BdL. The authorities generally recognized that the BdL has been doing
much to preserve the credibility of the peg while providing support to the government and the
economy. They noted that recent steps to lower CD rates to align them fully with T-bill rates had
been well-received, and could pave the way over time to a less active role in the management of
government debt. But they disagreed with the claim that the BdL was actively intermediating the
flow of funds between the banks and the government. Instead, they stressed that the issue of
longer-term CDs was, in part, motivated by the BdL’s capital-market development goals—longterm BdL CDs were viewed as a key first step in extending the yield curve, and would ultimately help
promote the issuance of longer-term T-bills by the Treasury. In this connection, they also explained
that T-bills are more desirable than CDs to banks because they are more liquid—in fact when the
government followed the central bank with the issuance of longer maturity bonds, banks showed
appetite for these instruments. More broadly, they remained confident that the balance sheet of the
BdL would be strengthened over time, though conditions were not yet favorable for pursuing
alternative policy actions in the short term.

B. Aiming Higher: Stronger and More Inclusive Growth
29.
Higher growth, better growth. Current low growth rates are insufficient to address social
inequities and create jobs; and even in the past, higher growth has often only benefitted a few. In
discussing Lebanon’s longer-term prospects, staff stressed three key areas: strengthening the
financial system; structural reform, especially in electricity; and more and better data.
Financial stability
30.
Sustained, broad-based growth requires a sound financial system. The banking system
is one of the economy’s most critical pillars, and has contributed to growth and prosperity. Access
of households and firms to banking services is high compared to the region or with other countries
of similar income level.

Box 5. A Financial Conditions Index for Lebanon
A Financial Condition Index (FCI) combines several financial variables that influence GDP growth. It
provides a summary measure of domestic financial conditions and can be used to assess macro-financial
linkages. In particular, it points to the financial factors that are supporting or slowing real activity at any
point in time.
Financial conditions appear to have tightened over the past year in Lebanon. Staff computed an FCI,
showing that key drivers have been lower deposit growth and an appreciating real exchange rate, offset in
part by low global interest rates.
The computation involves three steps.1


First, a vector-autoregressive model including financial variables and real GDP growth was estimated
using quarterly data. The financial variables in the model include the 6-month LIBOR rate, deposit
growth, the spread between lending and deposit rates (both in USD and local currency), and the real
effective exchange rate (REER). The sample period covers 1995–2014.



Second, impulse responses are computed to assess the cumulative impact of a one-unit shock to the
financial variables on GDP growth after 6 quarters. Structural shocks are identified through a Cholesky
decomposition.2



Third, the estimated responses are used as weights for each variable in the FCI. All financial variables are
expressed as deviations from their sample means.

LIBOR, deposit growth, and the REER are key drivers, with a more limited role for bank interest rate
spreads.
Financial conditions eased significantly after 2008, supporting growth. The loosening reflected higher
deposit inflows, lower global interest rates, a real depreciation and falling bank spreads.
But since 2014, financial conditions have tightened, in step with slowing economic activity. Deposit
growth in particular has decelerated, and is below its 20-year average. Looking forward, rising global interest
rates are expected to further tighten local conditions.

But the current environment is particularly
challenging. Banks’ capital buffers are modest, considering
their significant exposure to zero-weighted local-currency
sovereign debt. And despite the implicit subsidy associated
with the BdL’s credit support schemes, net interest margins
have been contracting (though from large levels) and profit
growth is down. Although as noted above there is little
evidence that credit growth in Lebanon is excessive, the
unfavorable outlook, combined with limited private-sector
lending opportunities and already-large exposures to the
government, would affect banks’ medium-term profitability.

Continued efforts to strengthen banking regulation and supervision are crucial.
Nonperforming loans (NPLs) have increased slightly, from a low base, while provisioning has
decreased and the use of overdraft facilities is widespread. Staff noted that the low level of NPLs, in
particular, is potentially at odds with Lebanon’s slowing economy, and will likely increase in the
short-to-medium term. In this regard, loan-classification rules do not provide an explicit test of
whether the renegotiation or rescheduling of a loan could be concealing debt service problems.
And there is no written rule regarding the classification of high-balance overdrafts that are
permanently rolled over. Staff reiterated that the risk weights applicable to foreign currency claims
on the BdL and holdings of Eurobonds should be set in accordance with the Basel capital adequacy
framework. It welcomed the Banking Control Commission’s efforts to strengthen its supervision of
banking groups with cross-border operations, and encouraged pursuing the establishment of
supervisory colleges for Lebanese banking groups with significant operations abroad.
33.
Macroprudential policies can be helpful to limit systemic risk. Staff welcomed the
creation of a Financial Stability Unit within the BdL to monitor financial risks. New macroprudential
measures were introduced in 2014—though it is too early to assess their effectiveness.

22

34.
Risks related to Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism
(AML/CFT) issues remain. The existing legislation is not in line with revised international
standards, as a new AML/CFT Law has been pending in parliament since 2010. Staff therefore called
for its adoption and for the allocation of sufficient resources for its effective implementation. The
BdL has also recently strengthened monitoring requirements at the level of each banking branch.
Efforts should also focus on the regulation of cross-border cash transactions and the risk-based
supervision of banks, and money remitters in particular, along with developing a better
understanding of the origin of non-resident deposits and their beneficial owners.
35.
The authorities’ request for an FSAP update is most welcome. The update is scheduled
for 2016, and should also tackle the development of capital markets to help promote a more
diversified flow of resources to the economy.
36.
Reform of capital markets should continue. Building on ongoing progress (Box 3), staff
recommended a rapid move to transforming the Beirut Stock Exchange into a joint-stock
company—already foreseen in the law that established the Capital Markets Authority—to pave the
way for its privatization.

Authorities’ views
37.
The authorities agreed that a sound banking system is critical to Lebanon’s future
growth and prosperity. In this regard, both the banks and their supervisors were keenly aware of
the economic and reputational risks associated with Lebanon’s challenging environment, and all
agreed on the need for a continued culture of prudence and caution. They underscored the BdL’s
efforts to address Basel requirements ahead of the implementation deadlines and to require
additional capital buffers on top of the Basel III minimum and conservation buffers. They noted that
the decline in the ratio of specific provisions to NPLs over the past year was due to a composition
effect—NPLs include "substandard" loans, which had increased in importance, but do not require
specific provisions. The Banking Control Commission is progressively moving toward the adoption
of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 9 norms that would require provisioning based
on expected losses. But in the interim, it was stressed that total provisioning, including both specific
and general provisions, had increased as a share of total NPLs. The authorities agreed that NPLs
would likely grow in the immediate future, but considered that banks had sufficient buffers to
comfortably absorb any increase.
38.
The authorities expressed confidence in the effectiveness of Lebanon’s AML/CFT
regime. They noted that, although the current framework is not formally compliant with
international standards, there are three draft laws pending parliamentary approval. In the interim,
the BdL requires that Lebanese banks abide by the regulations in place in the countries of their
correspondent banks whenever these are stricter. They mentioned the reluctance and even refusal
of Lebanese banks to deal with small money remitters as evidence of bank awareness of AML/CFT
issues and stricter controls. Hence there is no concern about derisking by international
correspondent banks vis-à-vis their Lebanese counterparts.

39.
The authorities also underscored the importance of continuing the reform of capital
markets. They highlighted the significance of market consultations on the capital markets
regulations, with assistance from the World Bank, to marshal support and ownership of the reforms.
As to the transformation of the Beirut Stock Exchange into a joint-stock company, they regretted
that progress had been slow.

Structural reform
40.
There cannot be enduring and inclusive growth without structural reform. The
traditional drivers of growth in Lebanon are also those most vulnerable to region-wide uncertainty
and security concerns. These sectors, in addition, have failed to provide the high-quality, job-rich
growth needed to secure social stability. Indeed, Lebanon’s employment-growth elasticity (0.2) is
one of the lowest in the region, and job creation has not kept up with the economy’s rapidly
expanding labor force—now increased by the refugee influx.11 The reform agenda is well known,
but little has been done.
41.
Lebanon’s current account deficit suggests an
underlying competitiveness problem, even factoring
in the Syria crisis. The sharp increase in the deficit is
attributable, in part, to the disruption of traditional trade
relationships and elevated regional uncertainty—
though the deficit is expected to improve (slowly) over
the medium term. Nonetheless, even abstracting from
the impact of Syria, the external balance is weaker than
suggested by fundamentals, pointing to an underlying
problem with productivity and competitiveness (see
Annex II). If Lebanon is to transition to a stronger, more
sustainable growth model, action is needed to boost
productivity, fight corruption, and address the cost
of doing business.
42.
Electricity reform is an urgent priority.
Lebanon’s inefficient electricity supply is a major
impediment to growth: losses from EdL weigh
heavily on public finances, and poor service delivery
has prompted the extensive use of costly private
generators. Implementation of longstanding
plans to strengthen generation capacity, switch to
less-expensive natural gas, and improve
transmission and distribution would go a long way

toward reducing business and consumption costs. It would also ensure more equitable access to
essential services. In parallel, the authorities should start to bring electricity tariffs more in line with
cost recovery to reduce the burden on public finances—though in a way that protects more
vulnerable consumers.
43.
Similarly, the passage of pending legislation would be a welcome signal for potential
investors. The framework law for Public Private Partnerships (PPPs)—awaiting parliamentary
approval for three years—could help mobilize private-sector resources for infrastructure
investment, though with due attention to possible fiscal risks. Similarly, long-delayed decrees on
gas resources would not only signal to investors that the government is capable of moving beyond
its current paralysis, it might also trigger the start of renewed FDI inflows.
44.
Reforms are also needed to arrest the chronic de-skilling of Lebanon’s labor force,
and promote high-productivity growth. While the immediate need is to create formal-sector
employment opportunities for lower-skilled workers (for example, through special programs and
targeted public work schemes), over time Lebanon needs to move toward higher-quality sectors to
absorb its flow of new, highly-skilled job seekers. Indeed, preliminary results from a recent ILO
survey suggest that prospects for university graduates in Lebanon—in terms of an education
premium for entry-level salaries or the ease of transition to a regular job—is worse than the MENA
average.12
45.
Finally, better public services will not only improve competitiveness but also increase
equity. In addition to Lebanon’s large current account deficit, other indicators suggest that the
economy is losing external competitiveness. Part of the explanation is the fact that public-service
delivery and social safety nets are far from satisfactory: hindering the economy’s ability to respond
to new opportunities and to provide an environment in which dynamic and innovative firms can
thrive. Indeed, Lebanon has an enviable supply of high-quality human capital, but halting the
economy’s ongoing brain drain will require better core services and a social protection system that
is both reliable and fair.
46.
A case in point is the pension system, which is not only fiscally unsustainable but also
suffers from striking equity shortcomings. Short-term improvements should include the
implementation of selected parametric changes and only limited indexation to salaries—especially
in view of the planned salary scale adjustment. Over the longer term, a unified pension scheme for
public and private sector employees would go a long way to address the system’s sustainability and
equity concerns.

Authorities’ views
47.
The authorities agreed broadly with staff’s diagnosis and suggested priorities, but
noted that the lack of reform was a symptom of Lebanon’s underlying political deadlock. The
reform agenda is well known. Indeed, many specific measures—such as a proposed adjustment to
electricity tariffs, the expansion of electricity generation capacity, the introduction of LNG facilities,
the oil and gas laws, or an agreed PPP framework—had been prepared and agreed at a technical
level, but were awaiting agreement by the council of ministers. Regrettably, further progress was
unlikely without a resolution of the current political crisis. Nonetheless, the authorities noted that
the ongoing dialogue between the various factions, and the recent concerted efforts to pass a
budget underscored a general commitment by all parties to find a solution, and insisted that once
found, action on the reform agenda could follow very quickly.
48.
The authorities welcomed the renewed emphasis on pension reform. They underscored
the need to address the generosity of the pension scheme, highlighted the system’s inadequacy
and expressed concern that the planned salary scale adjustment will result in additional pressures
on pension liabilities.
Data Issues
49.
Timely and reliable data are crucial for greater accountability. Although data collection
and dissemination have improved in some areas, national and external accounts, fiscal, social, and
labor-market statistics remain weak, undermining economic decision making, transparency, and
policy effectiveness. Staff expressed concern about accumulating delays in the provision of data to
the public, and noted increasing lack of cooperation and coordination among various agencies
(Box 6). Steps to restore and strengthen collaboration—along with adequate funding and high-level
support for the Central Administration of Statistics—would help improve statistics.

26

Box 6. Data Issues in Lebanon—Capacity Constraints
Even before the civil war, Lebanon had struggled to build a sound statistical system. Very few statistical
surveys were undertaken.1 The only national population census comes from the French mandate in 1936
(never updated for political reasons) and the most comprehensive and first official study of Lebanon’s social
and developmental situation was conducted in 1960 by the Institut International de Recherche et de
Formation, Education Cultures Développement (IRFED) mission, published in 1961.2 The civil war destroyed
many databases and led to the loss of much-needed human capital. In 1979, the authorities established the
Central Administration of Statistics (CAS), with a mandate to collect, process, produce and disseminate
official social and economic statistics at the national level.
Given its limited size and resources, CAS cannot finance and conduct its own surveys and has to rely
heavily on other government bodies to receive source data.3 However, CAS has recently experienced
increasing difficulties in accessing data from other agencies. For example, its plan to start computing a
Producer Price Index has been hampered by the lack of access to basic data on individual enterprises. VAT
records could be used as an alternative, but even here there have been increasing delays.
Despite its mandate, CAS is not the only agency producing social and economic statistics. During the
civil war, a private firm started producing a Consumer Price Index (CPI) for Beirut and its suburbs—still
widely used particularly after the 2013 disruption in the production of official CPI data. In addition,
responsibility for national accounts production and dissemination was only transferred to CAS in 2012,
starting with the accounts for 2010.4 For the period 1997–2009, these statistics were produced by a special
team appointed by the prime minister’s office, with technical assistance from the French National Institute of
Statistics and Economic Studies.
Inadequate data sharing and dissemination are prime examples of the sometimes poor state of
public-goods provision in Lebanon. Reliable, timely and accurate data as a key input for sound decisionmaking and accountability are lacking.

STAFF APPRAISAL
‫العين بصيرة واليد قصيرة‬
The eye sees, but the arm is short (cannot reach), Arabic proverb
50.
As the proverb goes, Lebanon can see but its arms are incapable of reaching. The
problems and challenges it faces are well-known, though little is being done to address them. And
since resilience in the face of adversity has always won the day, the main challenge now is a
growing sense of complacency in the political system. In fact, political inertia is moving the country
steadily backward—the legitimacy of Lebanese institutions is eroding, and the ability of the political
class to work toward common solutions is waning. Perhaps more worryingly, even at the technical
level political divisions are triumphing over traditional norms that have, in the past, tended to
encourage cooperation. Data provision is a case in point, with increasing delays and difficulties in
getting information across institutions, or even between departments in the same agency.
51.
Lebanon’s traditional lifelines should not be taken for granted. Established growth
sectors have been hit hard, while poverty and unemployment are increasing, and fiscal sustainability
is in jeopardy. And although the bank-sovereign nexus has been a source of resilience, the
economy relies on continued deposit inflows and so remains vulnerable to adverse shifts in
confidence. The country has faced difficulties before, but this time they have come together in a
particularly detrimental combination, with a potentially lasting impact. The oil price decline has
provided breathing space, but only temporarily.
52.
Lebanon’s economic problems are compounded by formidable security challenges.
The country hosts over 1 million refugees from Syria, and faces growing security risks from an
increasingly tense regional environment. International support has helped, but more is needed
urgently, especially for the hosting communities. Still, despite all odds, Lebanon has managed so
far—especially in the area of security, a key precondition for stability. Increasingly though,
macroeconomic stability and shared prosperity will be critical in anchoring longer-term security,
and in defusing looming social tensions.
53.
Faced with exceptional circumstances, policies should aim at restoring fiscal
sustainability and securing inclusive growth. While these goals will require a concerted
medium-term strategy—a remote prospect at present, given the political impasse—efforts should
be focused in the interim on a few concrete steps. These would not only serve as symbols of a
nation that is now able to move forward, but would also in themselves help engineer a soft-landing
to a better future. Two priority areas stand out.
54.
The first priority is passing a budget for 2015—the first in a decade—to signal that
the fiscal situation is under control. Attention has been focused on a controversial salary scale
adjustment for the public sector, which has been promised but which the country can ill-afford right
now. If passed, it should be conditional on measures to mitigate its impact (a strong revenue
package; no retroactive payments and with installments; and measures to increase public sector

28

LEBANON

productivity). However, there is an urgent need to pass revenue measures regardless, including
increased fuel taxation, broader tax bases and strengthened compliance. This will help secure a
sustainable primary balance, and create fiscal space for more capital projects and social spending.
Finally, credible fiscal adjustment will allow monetary policy to refocus squarely on supporting the
peg—which remains the key nominal anchor—and less on propping up the economy and ensuring
an adequate flow of funding for the government.
55.
The second priority is the electricity sector. Households and businesses have long
suffered from inadequate electricity provision, having (almost universally) to resort to very
expensive private generation, while the government has been bleeding funds to support EdL.
Cabinet should urgently implement electricity improvements—a game-changer—for productivity,
competitiveness, growth, and equity.
56.
The authorities’ close oversight of the financial system is welcome but should be
reinforced. Strengthened supervision will support bank stability. But, given Lebanon’s challenging
environment, there is also a need to increase capital buffers, improve loan classification and
restructuring rules, and further enhance the AML/CFT framework. The forthcoming FSAP will add
recommendations in this area. In addition, privatization of the Beirut Stock Exchange will help
deepen financial markets, by encouraging start-ups to launch IPOs and opening the door for
trading commodities.
57.
Structural reforms remain essential to enhance Lebanon’s growth potential. There is an
urgent need to jump-start the legislative agenda—including on the new Petroleum Tax Law, the
Exploration and Production Agreement for the oil and gas sector, and the Public Private Partnership
framework law to attract private investment. Labor reforms that help create formal-sector
employment opportunities for lower-skilled workers are also needed, especially given the added
pressure from Syrian refugees. And more broadly, better public service provision and stronger
safety nets, starting with the pension system, would improve competitiveness and increase equity.
58.
Finally, strengthened cooperation towards, and proper funding for, data compilation
and dissemination are crucial for greater accountability. Although data collection and
dissemination have improved in some areas, national and external accounts, fiscal, social, and labormarket statistics remain weak. Statistics cannot improve without better inter-agency cooperation
and high-level support for the Central Administration of Statistics.
59.
Staff propose that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Annex I. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis1
With public debt already exceeding 130 percent of GDP and gross financing needs around 25 percent
of GDP in 2015, Lebanon faces significant risks to public debt sustainability. Under the baseline
scenario, debt and financing needs will continue to rise as a share of GDP, reaching 143 percent and
40 percent, respectively. In addition, debt dynamics and financing needs are subject to significant
macroeconomic shocks, especially to growth and the interest rate, and contingent liability shocks.
Large liquidity buffers and a captive investor base continue to represent important mitigating factors.
Decisive policy actions are nevertheless required to restore fiscal sustainability.
1.
The baseline scenario assumes that the conflict in Syria will start to ease only in 2016.
This is also underpinned by the following assumptions:


Real GDP growth is projected not to exceed 2.5 percent until 2016, mainly as a result of the
impact of the Syria crisis on Lebanon. It is projected to increase to 3 percent in 2017, and return
to its potential estimated at 4 percent from 2019 onward.



Inflation (measured by the GDP deflator) is estimated to decelerate from 5.3 percent in 2013
to 2.8 percent in 2014, but is projected to increase to around 7 percent in 2015 as a result
of temporary windfall from lower oil prices, before settling around 2 percent on average in
2016–20.



The primary balance is projected to switch to small surpluses starting in 2016. These projections
are based on: (i) an estimate of the salary scale adjustment; (ii) a gradual reduction in subsidies
to the state-owned electricity company, Electricité du Liban (EdL), reflecting global oil prices;
and (iii) tax measures on income and profits, capital gains, and some stamp fees and charges
(see main text).

2.
The baseline assumptions are broadly plausible. Staff forecast track record is not
systematically biased, as reflected in projection errors generally not being consistently on one side.
The median forecast errors for inflation and primary balance during 2006–14 are broadly in line with
those observed in other countries, while the forecast track record for real GDP growth for 2011–14
shows some bias, not differently from other surveillance benchmark countries. The projected fiscal
adjustment is consistent with experiences of surveillance countries.
3.
The deteriorating debt outlook reflects the projected path of fiscal adjustment and
positive interest rate-growth differential. The public debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to increase
from 133 percent in 2014 to 143 percent in 2020. The authorities’ fiscal consolidation, measured by
changes in the primary balance, is relatively modest and assumed to take effect gradually. While
economic growth will increasingly contribute to lowering debt over time, its impact will not be large
enough to offset adverse dynamics from real interest rates. The gross financing needs are forecast
1

to fluctuate around 30 percent of GDP over the projection period, peaking to around 40 percent of
GDP in 2018. The upward financing needs trajectory is primarily driven by large fiscal deficits and
the debt maturity profile—an average of around 3 and 5 years, for domestic and foreign debt,
respectively.
4.
The debt and financing needs projections are particularly sensitive to growth and
contingent liability shocks:


Growth shock. Slower growth remains the principal risk to debt sustainability. Assuming a
decline in growth by one standard deviation for 2016 and 2017, the debt-to-GDP ratio is
forecast to reach almost 160 percent in 2020. Financing needs are projected to reach almost
45 percent of GDP in 2020 and remain at high levels until the end of the projection horizon.



Interest rate shock. Higher interest rates also pose a significant risk to debt sustainability. A
shock to the interest rate results in the debt-to-GDP ratio reaching almost 150 percent at the
end of the projection horizon, with financing needs projected to exceed 40 percent of GDP.



Macro-fiscal shock. If shocks to growth, interest rate, and primary balance occurred
simultaneously, the debt-to-GDP ratio would exceed 170 percent at the end of the projection
horizon. Financing needs would reach almost 50 percent of GDP in 2020.



Contingent liability shock. In the absence of concrete estimates of contingent liabilities, a
standardized shock of 10 percent of financial sector assets is used to represent a hypothetical
realization of such contingent liabilities. In such a scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio would exceed
175 percent at the end of the projection horizon. Financing needs would exceed 45 percent of
GDP in 2020. The large effect reflects the significant size of Lebanon’s banking sector relative to
the size of its economy.

5.
The fan charts show significant uncertainty around the baseline. The width of the
symmetric fan chart, estimated at around 50 percent of GDP, illustrates the degree of uncertainty
for equal-probability upside and downside shocks. But in light of the downside risks associated with
the Syria crisis, an upside shock to growth is constrained to zero in the asymmetric fan chart,
resulting in a more upward-sloping debt path. This reflects a balance of risks skewed to the
downside.
6.
Lebanon’s debt profile reveals weaknesses. External financing needs are well above
the upper risk-assessment benchmark and public debt in foreign currency is above the lower
risk-assessment benchmark. These factors point to risks in case of pressures on the exchange rate
and foreign exchange reserves. While bond spreads are above the lower risk assessment
benchmark, they have been relatively stable even in times of stress. Public debt held by
nonresidents is estimated to be only slightly above the lower risk assessment benchmark, while the
level of, and the change in, short-term debt are below the lower risk assessment benchmarks.

7.

Risks to debt sustainability should be weighed against a number of mitigating factors.



Investor base. Debt is held largely by domestic financial institutions that are tightly regulated in
terms of their net open positions and investment strategies. This factor, coupled with relatively
low demand for private sector credit and limited regional investment opportunities, has
resulted in a captive investor base. In turn, domestic financial institutions fund their positions
from deposits largely held by nonresidents, which have shown resilience in times of stress.2 In
addition, a significant share of domestic debt is held by the BdL. Given that the debt is held
predominantly by domestic investors, an alternative metric that might better capture risks to
debt sustainability is the public debt-to-broad money ratio. This ratio decreased from
66 percent in 2003 to 45 percent in 2014 and is forecasted to stay below 50 percent over the
projection horizon.



Debt financing profile. The large external financing needs amounting to around 160 percent
of GDP reflect payments related to debt but also, to a significant extent, large nonresident
short-term deposits. The exclusion of nonresident deposits—given their past stability—reduces
external financing needs to around 40 percent of GDP over the projection horizon—still well
above benchmark values but possibly capturing immediate risks more accurately. Although
debt denominated in foreign currency accounts for more than 40 percent of total public debt, it
is held mostly by domestic financial institutions and is underpinned by sizable external buffers
in the form of international reserves. The level of, and the change in, short-term debt are very
low, substantially reducing refinancing risk.



Buffers. The high level of gross international reserves remains an anchor for investors’
confidence. In addition, banks’ NFA also represent a substantial buffer. Finally, there are also
significant cash cushions in the form of deposits accumulated by the government. The average
figure for government deposits points to around 20 percent of GDP,3 which implies a
significantly lower public debt-to-GDP ratio on a net basis and coverage of financing needs for
around half a year.

8.
The authorities broadly concurred with staff’s analysis. They noted challenges to
formulating a credible medium-term fiscal strategy, while underscoring mitigating factors to debt
sustainability risks. In particular, they singled out the issue of the large external financing needs as
an example of an indicator that does not capture well Lebanon’s specific circumstances.

2

These sizable deposits (around 120 percent of GDP) have consistently behaved as long-term deposits, despite their
short maturity profile, reflecting the loyalty of the Lebanese diaspora and other regional investors. But given that
nonresident deposits are contractually of short maturity, this factor can also be considered as a potential source of
vulnerability.
3

The government’s foreign exchange account has, however, been in overdraft over the past few years, which
reduces the size of the buffer.

Annex II. External Sector Assessment1
1.
Despite recent nominal appreciation, Lebanon’s CPI-based real effective exchange
rate (REER) has remained unchanged over the past 12 months. The nominal effective exchange
rate appreciated considerably, reflecting the strength of the U.S. dollar. However, Lebanon has
experienced a sudden bout of CPI deflation in recent months, as lower oil prices have been passed
through to the domestic economy (Box 4). This has offset the impact of the nominal appreciation,
resulting in a relatively flat real effective rate. Looking further backward, the REER has appreciated
by around 20 percent since 2008, its lowest level in the past decade.2

In the wake of the Syria crisis, Lebanon’s current account deficit has widened
significantly. The deficit in 2014 was substantial, at 25 percent of GDP, having increased sharply in
2012 from pre-crisis levels of 21 percent and 15 percent in 2010 and 2011, respectively—largely
reflecting a significant drop in “other services” receipts (primarily business services) driven by the
adverse impact of the Syria crisis on services trade. It should be noted, however, that there are still
significant uncertainties regarding the accuracy of Lebanon’s current-account data (Box A1).
Further, goods exports and travel receipts (i.e., tourism) have also declined, due to disrupted transit
routes and heightened domestic and regional uncertainty. However, early signs point to a slight
recovery of tourist receipts in 2014.

Housing costs in Lebanon’s CPI were sampled only infrequently (every three years) prior to 2014. Staff smoothed
the step increase associated with the infrequent sampling. Weights used for 2005 and subsequent years are different
from the standard weights available in Information System’s Notice.

Box 1. Current Account Data in Lebanon
Lebanon’s current account balance data have been revised substantially, and repeatedly. During
the staff visit in March 2014, the authorities’ estimate of the current account deficit in 2012 (with an
adjustment for income flows1) was 7¾ percent of GDP. This estimate was subject to some uncertainty,
however, and the team at the time maintained their own, substantially higher, figure. The authorities’
estimate was then revised up to 11¾ percent of GDP by the time of the 2014 Article IV Consultation,
owing to corrections by reporting banks of services-accounts data forwarded to the BdL. For the
purposes of the Article IV discussion, IMF staff largely aligned their estimates with those of the
authorities, but concluded that the services deficit was still 1 percentage point worse than suggested
by the authorities, leading to a slightly different overall estimate.
Late last year, the authorities again adjusted their estimated current account deficit upward, by
more than 10 percent of GDP. In discussions with reporting banks, the BdL discovered that a number
had been forwarding materially incorrect data, following an IT upgrade. Accounting for these mistakes,
the net result was a sizable downward revision of the services account. The current account deficit is
now estimated at around 24½ percent of GDP in 2012 and 26¾ percent in 2013 (adjusted again for
income flows). In comparison, other revisions to the current-account data have been relatively modest.
But, even the new (corrected) estimate should be treated cautiously. Lebanon’s main trading
partner for services is Syria, and the widening current account deficit has emerged at a time when the
Syrian conflict has worsened. So, it is likely that the larger deficit has been driven in large part by the
disruption of Syrian demand for travel and business services. It should be noted in this regard,
however, that Lebanon has had little difficulty financing its large current-account imbalances, with
reserves increasing steadily even in the wake of the crisis—although, in light of the recent revision, a
substantially larger portion is now funded by unrecorded inflows, which turn up in net errors and
omissions. The data issues with reporting banks might be ongoing; and combined with the recent
surge of refugees and the rapidly changing market for Lebanon’s services, this makes the accuracy
of Lebanon’s present estimates somewhat uncertain.

3.
The current account deficit is projected to narrow over the medium term but
will remain sizable—15 percent of GDP by 2020. In particular, exports of goods and services
will recover as domestic and regional uncertainties start to dissipate. While the projected
10 percentage-point adjustment of the external balance is considerable, the baseline nonetheless
assumes that the crisis will still be influencing the current account balance even over the projection
horizon, with a majority (two thirds) of Syrian refugees still in Lebanon by 2020.
4.
Consultative Group on Exchange Rate (CGER)-type methodologies, applied to the
baseline framework, suggest that Lebanon’s exchange rate is overvalued.3,4 This finding
contrasts with the results from the 2014 Article IV consultation, reflecting the authorities’ recent
revision to the current account balance, and a new (less optimistic) assumption regarding the
persistence of the Syrian crisis’ impact on Lebanon’s balance of payments.
5.
The extent of actual misalignment is likely to be lower than indicated by the
CGER-type calculation. As discussed above, the medium-term external current account deficit
projection reflects the highly persistent, but still temporary, impact of the Syria crisis. Abstracting
from these effects, the REER would appear to be less overvalued.

3

The analytical tools were developed to facilitate external assessments for countries that are not included in the
Consultative Group on Exchange Rate Issues (CGER) sample; it applies the same analytical approaches as those
proposed by the CGER, but to a larger panel spanning emerging and developing countries, including Lebanon.
Additional methodological information can be found at http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/dp/2014/dp1401.pdf.
Panel regression results are based on data from 2014 October WEO. The underlying external current account
balance is taken from the latest WEO submission.
4

A third approach commonly used—the Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate (ERER)—could not be applied as it relies on
labor productivity data, not available for Lebanon as employment data are missing.

Annex III. External Debt Sustainability Analysis1
1.
Lebanon’s external debt will remain elevated. The external debt was 165 percent of GDP
at end-2014, up from its most recent trough of 163 percent at end-2010. The increase reflects
Lebanon’s sizable current account deficits, financed in large part by nonresident deposits into the
banking sector (short-term deposits account for 77 percent of the economy’s external debt). Under
the baseline scenario, external debt is projected to increase slightly to 175 percent of GDP by 2020.
These projections assume a gradual recovery in GDP growth, an easing of the non-interest current
account deficit, a rise of nonresident deposit inflows, and a general increase in nominal interest
rates.
2.
Two main factors mitigate the underlying vulnerabilities associated with high external
debt.


Almost all nonresident deposits are short-term, though they largely originate from the
Lebanese diaspora. They have been relatively stable over past stress episodes and account for
some 80 percent of gross external financing needs over the projection period.



Owing to a lack of information on maturity, all external non-deposit liabilities of banks and all
the external debt of nonbanks (about 10 percent of gross external financing) are treated as
short-term debt. This implies that gross annual financing needs and short-term external debt
are likely overestimated.

3.
Standard bound tests suggest that debt dynamics are sensitive to macroeconomic
shocks, particularly to the exchange rate. A one-time real depreciation of 30 percent in 2016
would increase the debt level to 244 percent of GDP (Figure 1, panel 6) on impact. This underscores
the importance of the exchange rate peg as a linchpin of macroeconomic and financial stability in
Lebanon. In addition, a permanent shock to the usual macroeconomic variables (½ standard
deviation based on historical data) would have the following impact:


For the interest rate, the debt ratio would increase to 180 percent of GDP by 2020 (Figure 1,
panel 2);



For the growth rate, it would increase to 190 percent of GDP by 2020 (Figure 1, panel 3); and



For the noninterest current account balance, it would increase to 199 percent of GDP by 2020
(Figure 1, panel 4).

A combined permanent shock of a ¼ standard deviation, applied simultaneously to the interest
rate, growth rate, and noninterest current account balance would raise the debt ratio to 197 percent
of GDP by 2020 (Figure 1, panel 5).

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with Lebanon
On June [26], 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Lebanon.
The conflict in Syria, now in its fifth year, dominates Lebanon’s outlook, with refugees now
comprising over one-quarter of the population. The refugee crisis is straining local
communities, adding to poverty and unemployment, and placing further pressure on the
economy’s already-weak public finances and infrastructure. Moreover, Lebanon faces a
difficult domestic political situation. The presidency has been vacant since May 2014 and a lack
of consensus between the major parties is hindering passage of key legislation.
In the face of this uncertainty, growth remains disappointing. Following a sharp drop in 2011,
growth has crawled upward to about 2–3 percent but remains well short of potential. IMF staff
estimate that GDP increased by only 2 percent in 2014 and project a similarly modest growth
rate in 2015. Lebanon’s traditional growth drivers—tourism, real estate, and construction—have
received a significant blow and a strong rebound is unlikely soon. Lebanon’s return to potential

growth (4 percent) before 2019 is now doubtful. Inflation also declined sharply in 2014 on the
back of lower oil prices and other one-off factors, but should return to about 3 percent by
end-2015.
On the fiscal side, exceptional factors allowed for a primary surplus in 2014, but without
decisive action fiscal deterioration will continue in 2015. The 2014 primary surplus of about
2.5 percent of GDP largely resulted from exceptional telecom transfers and, to some extent,
from withheld and delayed payments. But the primary balance is expected to return to a deficit
of almost 1.25 percent of GDP in 2015, with public debt remaining high at 132 percent of GDP.
Foreign-exchange and financial markets continue to be resilient, despite Lebanon’s sizable
external financial requirements. Inflows remain large, particularly from non-resident deposits;
and in the context of Lebanon’s currency peg to the U.S. dollar, the Banque du Liban (BdL) has
maintained an adequate level of gross foreign exchange reserves.

financial reporting, audit and control procedures, and recommended an update of the central
bank law. An update safeguards assessment was completed in August 2009 in the context of the
second EPCA. The update noted progress achieved in enhancing procedures for reserve
management and external audit, but recommended further actions to strengthen internal audit,
financial reporting transparency, oversight, and central bank legislation.
Nonfinancial Relations
Exchange Arrangement
Lebanon has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 in 1993, and maintains
an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions. The exchange arrangement, which maintains a de-facto peg to the
U.S. dollar, is classified as stabilized. Since October 1999, the BdL has been intervening to keep
the pound around a mid-point parity of LL 1,507.5 per $1, with a bid-ask spread of LL+/-6.5.
Last Article IV Consultation
The 2014 Article IV Consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on June 26, 2014. At the
time, Directors noted that the conflict in Syria and domestic political uncertainty were adding
stress to Lebanon’s already difficult economic environment. This led to a subdued growth, an
increase in fiscal imbalances and a rise in public debt. They commended the authorities’ efforts
for receiving an unprecedented inflow of Syrian refugees but recognized that this was straining
the economic and social structures and fueling already high unemployment and poverty. They
agreed that Lebanon needed additional support from the international community. They
emphasized the importance of a credible and balanced fiscal adjustment strategy to prevent
further fiscal deterioration. Directors agreed that monetary policy should remain geared towards
maintaining adequate FX reserves in support of the dollar peg. They underscored the need to
reform the electricity sector, including by improving generation capacity and raising average
tariffs toward costs recovery, while protecting lower-income users. Directors emphasized the
importance of undertaking structural reforms to unlock Lebanon’s growth potential and improve
social conditions.
Financial Sector Assessment Program
Lebanon participated in the Financial Sector Assessment Program in 1999, and the related report
was presented to the Executive Board at the time of the 1999 Article IV Consultation
(FO/DIS/99/113). A Financial System Stability Assessment update was conducted in 2001, and
the related report presented to the Executive Board at the time of the 2001 Article IV
Consultation (SM/01/281). In February 2015, the authorities requested an FSAP update. The
scoping mission is expected to take place in the fall of 2015 and the FSAP in early 2016.

WORLD BANK-IMF COLLABORATION
1.
The Lebanon teams of the Fund and the World Bank met to discuss macrocritical
structural reforms and coordinate their work in 2015.1 The teams agreed that economic
performance is expected to remain weak as a result of domestic and external uncertainty. The Syria
crisis dominates Lebanon’s short-term outlook and longer-term prospects. Lebanon’s main shortterm macroeconomic challenge is to deliver a credible policy mix with sustained adjustment and a
falling public debt ratio. In the medium term the authorities should embark on structural reform,
starting immediately with the electricity sector, to achieve social stability and a job-rich, sustainable
growth. Finally, the authorities need to strengthen capital buffers and continue the ongoing efforts
to strengthen banking regulation and supervision, particularly regarding loan classification and
provisioning rules.
2.
Based on this shared assessment, the teams identified the following structural
reform areas as macrocritical, in view of their central role in achieving fiscal consolidation and
job-rich and sustained growth:


Electricity sector reform: There is an urgent need to strengthen and lower the costs of
electricity provision, and reduce budgetary transfers to the Electricité du Liban (EDL) by
implementing without delay long-standing plans that envisage (i) reducing the cost of
production, including through reducing systems losses and the reliance on expensive fuel oil;
(ii) increasing revenue collection; (iii) enhancing electricity supply by making necessary
investments; and (iv) gradually adjusting average tariff toward cost recovery levels, while
protecting poor households. These measures should be accompanied by a comprehensive
reform of the regulatory and institutional framework. Electricity sector reform is macrocritical
because Lebanon’s inefficient electricity supply is a major impediment to growth and the
large budgetary transfers to the sector (4.2 percent of GDP in 2014) undermine fiscal
sustainability. The ultimate goal should be zero EdL transfers, freeing up fiscal resources for
more productive uses.



Tax reform: Move toward an efficient and fair tax system by broadening tax bases,
strengthening compliance and increasing tax rates on capital gains on real estate
transactions, and withholding tax on interest income and corporate income tax. The
authorities need to seize the opportunity afforded by low oil prices to remove the VAT
exemption on diesel immediately, and increase gasoline excises. Tax reform is macrocritical
because it will help support a sustained and balanced fiscal adjustment.



Public financial management (PFM) reform: Key reform elements include: (i) further
strengthening of the macrofiscal unit in the Ministry of Finance; (ii) strengthening budget
preparation, cash and debt management; (iii) strengthening accounting, payment and

(Country Director).

auditing functions, including by introducing a Government Financial Management
Information System; (iv) completing the coverage of the Treasury Single Account; (v)
developing a system to account for arrears and increasing transparency and regularity in
treasury inflows and outflows and (vi) setting up a framework to assess the fiscal impact of
the Syrian refugees on certain budget lines. These reforms are macrocritical because they will
improve the management of public finances and reduce ad-hoc and discretionary
adjustments.

6



Social services and safety net reform: Social services and the social safety net are far from
satisfactory. The following reforms would help: (i) health: rationalizing health spending and
expanding health insurance coverage; (ii) pension systems: strengthening financial
sustainability and administration of the National Social Security Fund, reforming the end-ofservice indemnity, and ultimately introducing a unified and fairer pension system for public
and private sector employees to restore fiscal sustainability and ensure equity; (iii) education:
improving the quality of public education, including strengthening higher education and
vocational training and enhancing resources and capacity building at schools to
accommodate Syrian students; and (iv) social safety nets: improving targeting to the most
needy through among other initiatives expanding the coverage and enhancing the social
assistance package of the National Poverty Targeting Program (NPTP) to Lebanese affected
by the Syrian crisis and all Lebanese households under the extreme poverty line. These
reforms are macrocritical because they will increase the efficiency of public spending;
enhance the productivity of the workforce and strengthen growth prospects; reduce
inequalities as well as alleviate social tensions, and generate political support for the needed
fiscal consolidation.



Investment climate reform: Lebanon’s corporate sector is held back by the high costs of
doing business, arising from weaknesses in governance, regulatory systems, and contract
enforcement as well as high cost and inefficient provision of basic utilities like electricity,
water and transportation. Reforms in this area are macrocritical because they will improve
competitiveness, decrease business costs and help increase the growth potential.



Financial sector stability assessment: Given the very large financial sector and the high
dollarization, financial stability is key for macroeconomic stability. Assessing financial system
stability—which would be undertaken in the upcoming FSAP scheduled for early 2016 —is
macrocritical because it will help identify potential risks and provide suggestions for
addressing them.



Reform of the statistical system: Lebanon’s statistical system suffers from fragmentation
and limited capacity to provide timely and reliable data. More recently, accumulated delays
in the provision of data to the public and increasing lack of cooperation and coordination
among various agencies have been noted. Strengthening statistical systems is macrocritical
because timely and reliable data are needed to monitor economic and social developments
and support decision making and greater accountability.

The teams agreed to the following division of labor:



Electricity sector reform: The Bank will continue to elaborate reform options and discuss
them with the authorities. The Country Partnership Strategy of the Bank provides for
technical and financial support to the electricity sector to assist the government in
implementing its strategic plan.



Tax reform: The Fund and the Bank are providing technical assistance (TA) on the fiscal
regime for the oil and gas sector. The Fund is also providing revenue administration
technical assistance in this sector. It is also providing TA on implementing tax gap analysis
for Value Added Tax (VAT). If requested, the Fund will also provide TA on the design and
implementation of the capital gain tax and broadening tax bases and strengthening
compliance. If requested, the Bank could build on tax work available to perform analytical
studies on growth and welfare impact of fiscal policy options.



Revenue administration: The Fund is providing TA to the Lebanese Customs to support
specific initiatives in its strategic plan; and help strengthen the performance of the Large
Taxpayers’ Office (LTO) to develop audit programs based on sector-specific compliance risks.



Public financial management reform: The Fund is providing TA on (i) capacity building
for the macro-fiscal department, in collaboration with the World Bank; (ii) improving the
transparency and accountability of public accounts; and (iii) improving cash management.



Social services and safety net reform: The Bank will continue its analytical work in the area
of social safety nets and provide a prioritized list of policy recommendations through the
“Emergency Social Protection Implementation Support Project”. It will also expand the
coverage and enhance the social assistance package of the National Poverty Targeting
Program (NPTP).



Investment climate reform: The Bank is planning to conduct an assessment of the
investment climate, with a special focus on the large informal sector.



Financial sector stability assessment: The Fund is providing TA on the supervision of
nonbank financial institutions and the cross-border supervision of banks, including by
establishing supervisory colleges. The Bank provided TA on the development of the
insurance sector and capital markets. The Bank and the Fund will cooperate closely under the
Financial Sector Assessment Program scheduled for early 2016.



Reform of the statistical system: The Fund will continue to provide TA on the consumer
price index, national accounts, and balance of payments statistics. The Bank is providing
advisory services on the national household income and expenditure survey.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Lebanon—Statistical Issues
(As of June 2, 2015)

I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance, particularly
in national accounts and external sector statistics. Lack of timely, comprehensive and reliable national
accounts data and social and labor market indicators undermine accountability and economic
analysis. Fiscal reporting has recently been lagging and irregular treasury inflows and outflows
undermine data compilation.
National accounts: National accounts data are weak. Only annual data are compiled and
disseminated at this time. Data are available through 2013, with significant revisions to growth
estimates for 2010–2012. There are plans to start publishing quarterly data; however, the priority
should be to improve the annual estimates before developing quarterly ones. The responsibility of
producing national accounts statistics was transferred to the Central Administration of Statistics
(CAS) in 2012 for the publication of 2011 accounts. Data sources are limited, mainly administrative
data. Access to comprehensive business financial records maintained by the Ministry of Finance
would greatly improve annual national accounts estimates and support the release of quarterly data.
The Fund’s Statistics Department (STA) started assisting CAS in reviewing the methodology and data
collection for the annual national accounts, and starting the compilation of quarterly national
accounts. A resident national accounts expert will join METAC in September 2015.
Price statistics: A new Consumer Price Index (CPI) was released in March 2014 by the CAS with Fund
assistance. Notable improvements introduced with the new CPI include the dissemination of more
detailed national level index data on the CAS website; the publication of regional indexes; monthly
collection of rent prices; and improved index calculation methods. The CPI covers all areas in
Lebanon and is disseminated within three weeks after the end of the reference month. The CPI was
not compiled during January–May 2013 due to delays in funding provided by the prime minister’s
office. Funding to CAS and data compilation resumed thereafter under strong Fund pressures.
There is an immediate need to develop regular and timely statistics on producer prices, while
medium- to long-term needs include data on wages and real estate prices.
Government finance statistics: Significant delays are still ongoing in the release of fiscal data. While
the dissemination of central government finance statistics (GFS) has improved in recent years, the
coverage of government finance statistics is not comprehensive. Published monthly data on the
central government budgetary accounts do not cover items such as certain transfers, financing data,
foreign-financed capital expenditure, and arrears; they include dues that should eventually be
transferred to third parties (Telecom revenue due to municipalities). Some (treasury) spending is only
identified ex post, and presented in an economic classification with a lag. These items are
nonetheless provided to the Lebanon team in the context of surveillance activities. Government
finance statistics are on a modified cash basis for revenue (transfers from the Telecom) and
budgetary expenditure data (issuance of payment orders). The ministry of finance needs a framework
to assess the fiscal impact of the Syrian refugees on certain budget lines. GFS data for budgetary
central government based on Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 are published on a yearly
basis in the IMF publication the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook; however, these data cover
only transactions and no balance sheet data are reported.

LEBANON

Lebanon—Statistical Issues (concluded)
Monetary and financial statistics: The sectorization of institutional units and classification of
financial instruments in the data reported to STA fall short of what is needed for the compilation of
Standardized Report Forms. Reflecting in part restrictions imposed by domestic legislation, the
Banque du Liban (BdL) does not publish externally-audited financial statements, and its reporting
practices are not fully compliant with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The lack
of a reliable classification of deposits by residency (also due to bank secrecy) complicates the balance
of payments analysis.
Financial sector surveillance: Lebanon is a regular reporter of Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs).
All core and eight encouraged FSIs are reported on regular quarterly basis, except for the two
indicators on capital adequacy that are reported on semi-annual basis. Compilation of FSIs for other
sectors (other financial corporations, non-financial corporations, households, real estate markets) is
needed to expand the list of FSIs compiled by Lebanon for macro prudential analysis.
Balance of payments: There have been efforts to improve Balance of Payments (BoP) statistics,
including the quality of surveys through better compliance. However, there remain significant
challenges to compiling reliable BoP data. In particular, there are data issues in the current account
(unrecorded exports and imports, uncertainty with respect to the estimates of private sector services,
workers’ remittances, and investment income), the capital account (grants), and the financial account
(foreign direct investment, equity investment in the nonbank private sector, and corporate borrowing
abroad). Data is subject to frequent and very large revisions that hamper accurate assessment of the
external sector position of Lebanon. A Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) survey is currently in progress.
The progress toward compiling an IIP statement is slow despite the TA missions provided in this
regard. The forms and the reporting requirements for banks and non-banks were amended in
January 2010 and May 2013 to include more comprehensive and detailed breakdown of BoP
components. The lack of effective inter-agency cooperation and data sharing between the BdL, CAS,
customs and the ministry of finance are among the main factors impeding progress and there is a
noted increase in the lack of cooperation and coordination among various agencies on data sharing.

II. Data Standards and Quality
Lebanon joined the General Data Dissemination System in January 2003. Metadata and plans for
improvement need to be updated. No Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) for
data dissemination is available for Lebanon.

III. Reporting to STA
Lebanon currently reports annual data based on GFSM 2001 to be published in the Government
Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY), but the data suffer from weaknesses, mainly limited coverage.
CAS does not currently report any data to STA. Lebanon reports monetary statistics on a regular
monthly basis, covering the Central Bank and commercial banks only. The monetary data are
reported with a timeliness of approximately three months. In September 2011, the BdL started
regular submission of core Financial Soundness Indicators data and metadata, and data for 2013
were posted on the IMF website. 2014 data is available for posting—it is delayed for technical
reasons.

Statement by Hazem Beblawi, Executive Director for Lebanon
and Maya Choueiri, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
June 26, 2015
1.
Lebanon is facing exceptional, force majeure, circumstances that are beyond its
control. The main challenge facing the country is the political and security impact of the
Syrian crisis, now entering its fifth year, and their ensuing economic and social
consequences. Since the onset of the crisis in early 2011, over one million registered Syrians,
about a quarter of the Lebanese population, have taken refuge in Lebanon. With this inflow,
Lebanon has become the country with the highest per capita concentration of refugees
worldwide.1 This has put serious pressures on virtually all aspects of the economy, straining
public finances, service delivery and the environment in particular. The crisis has also
resulted in increased poverty among the Lebanese, as well as higher unemployment.
Notwithstanding this difficult environment, the economy continued to be resilient and growth
is expected to hold up in 2015. Moreover, deposit inflows remain strong, foreign exchange
reserves at a comfortable level, and the banking system robust. This attests to the authorities’
capacity to maintain confidence, particularly the confidence of non-resident depositors,
which is the core strength of Lebanon’s financial system, despite the difficult environment.
Going forward, the authorities will continue to be faced with the challenge of coping with the
adverse implications of the Syrian crisis while preserving macroeconomic and financial
stability.
2.
International humanitarian support was extremely helpful in mitigating the impact of
the refugee crisis. However, it remains insufficient given the size of the problem, particularly
for local communities and the economy at large, as clearly outlined in Box 1 of the staff
report. Lebanon does not have the fiscal space to address the impact of the Syrian refugee
crisis alone; dealing with it requires strong international support.
Risks to the Outlook
3.
Assessing Lebanon’s economic developments and policies cannot abstract from
developments in the region, particularly the crisis in Syria, as these have major implications
for security in the country, and thereby for macroeconomic stability. The authorities feel that
this aspect could have been better recognized in the report. They also consider that the
challenges associated with the Syrian crisis, while documented in the report, could have been
better embedded in the economic analysis and the policy recommendations. This includes in
particular the fiscal cost associated with the refugee crisis and the challenges associated with
launching structural reforms. The domestic political crisis is largely a reflection of the

April 3, 2014, http://www.unhcr.org/533c1d5b9.html.

2
regional difficulties and cautious decision-making, particularly on divisive social issues, is
needed to preserve the country's stability and domestic cohesion at this juncture.
Fiscal Policy and Reforms
4.
Despite the fiscal burden of the refugees, a primary surplus of 2.5 percent of GDP
was achieved in 2014, which included larger than usual telecommunications transfers. The
authorities are committed to fiscal discipline and agree with staff that passing a budget for
2015 would be an important signal of this commitment. They put forward a draft 2015
budget in April which aims at balancing essential spending needs with stability goals. They
adopted measures aimed at supporting revenue earlier this year. These included an increase
in gasoline excises in January 2015 and efforts by the Ministry of Finance to tighten tax
collections, particularly through better enforcement and oversight of VAT refund claims.
5.
The draft budget is still debated, reflecting diverging views on the public sector
salary scale adjustment. The authorities are confident that the revenue measures they
envisaged would be sufficient to offset the cost of the salary scale adjustment. These
measures, in line with staff recommendations, include (i) an increase in the tax rate on
interest income from 5 to 7 percent; (ii) an increase in the corporate income tax rate from
15 to 17 percent; (iii) a capital gains tax on real estate transactions; and (iv) new stamp duties
and fees. The authorities welcomed the focus in the staff’s adjustment scenario on growth
and fairness aspects.
6.
The fiscal impact of the Syrian crisis is extensive. The negative impact on investor
and consumer confidence and the disruption in the trade routes for exports and imports of
goods, tourism, and financial services are placing downward pressure on government
revenues. Combined with rising demand for public services due to the large refugee influx,
this is further damaging Lebanon’s public finances. The staff report mentions rising
healthcare, education, electricity, and security costs, as well as the deterioration in the quality
of public services. An Economic and Social Impact Assessment led by the World Bank2
estimated the direct fiscal impact of the crisis over 2012–14 at US$2.6 billion (5½ percent of
GDP). It also suggested that restoring public-service provision to pre-crisis levels would
require an additional US$2.5 billion.
7.
The authorities concur with staff that there is scope to increase taxation in a fair
manner. They appreciated that in the context of a proposed adjustment scenario, staff was no
longer recommending a VAT rate increase up to 15 percent, which they had viewed as
regressive and difficult to implement. They had suggested at the time of last year’s Article IV
consultation enhancing tax capacity by broadening tax bases, addressing tax loopholes, and
2

Region, “Lebanon, Economic and Social Impact Assessment”, September 2013.

3
strengthening compliance, as these measures would help spread the burden of adjustment.
They appreciate the Fund’s ongoing technical assistance in these areas.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
8.
Monetary policy helped maintain confidence in the Lebanese financial system, with
the exchange rate peg providing a firm anchor for financial stability. The authorities continue
to maintain a high level of reserves, given the central role of the peg.
9.
The challenging environment has limited credit opportunities to the private sector. In
order to help address the problem, the Banque du Liban (BdL) has played a role by
introducing targeted subsidized schemes to support lending in key sectors. These schemes
have supported growth without resulting in a build-up of risks or a credit boom. Moreover,
the authorities have recently tightened macroprudential rules, namely the debt service to
income and loan-to-value-ratios, to avoid any potential leverage in the private sector. They
remained confident that the balance sheet of the BdL would be strengthened over time,
though conditions were not yet favorable for pursuing alternative policy actions in the short
term.
Banking Sector
10.
The banking sector remains resilient despite the challenging environment which has
limited credit opportunities to the private sector and the banks’ expansion in neighboring
countries. The BdL has strived to implement the Basel requirements ahead of the
implementation deadlines and to require additional capital buffers on top of the Basel III
minimum and conservation buffers. The authorities also emphasized that total provisioning,
including both specific and general provisions, had increased as a share of total
nonperforming loans, as outlined in paragraph 37 of the staff report. The authorities
expressed confidence in the effectiveness of Lebanon’s AML/CFT regime, which is in
practice fully compliant with international standards. Three draft laws await parliamentary
approval and in the interim, the BdL requires that Lebanese banks abide by the regulations in
place in the countries of their correspondent banks whenever these are stricter. Lebanon’s
financial intelligence unit, the Special Investigation Commission, actively cooperates with its
foreign counterparts.
Structural Reforms
11.
Despite the difficulty to undertake structural reforms given the political deadlock,
electricity sector reform continued to rank high on the authorities’ agenda in view of the
large budgetary transfers to the sector. In the past two years, progress was made under the
authorities’ 2011 comprehensive strategy, with the construction of a new power plant and the
rehabilitation of existing ones. Moreover, three private distribution service providers started
operations, and two power barges were rented to supplement power production while power
plants are being built. However, demand from refugees is estimated to absorb the electricity

4
supplied by the barges, setting back expected supply improvements. Moreover, the Ministry
of Finance has started the publication of a quarterly T-bill issuance calendar regularizing
long-term issuances, as well as of an updated public debt strategy. The authorities also
embarked on anti-corruption campaigns in the health sector and at customs.
