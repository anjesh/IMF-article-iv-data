REPUBLIC OF TAJIKISTAN
Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation, Final Review Under the StaffMonitored Program, and Request for a Three-Year Arrangement Under the
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
Prepared by Middle East and Central Asia Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by David Owen and Dominique Desruelle
March 31, 2009
Mission: A mission visited Dushanbe February 5–18, 2009 to hold discussions for the 2009
Article IV consultations, the second assessment under the staff-monitored program (SMP), and a
2009–12 program that could be supported under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF) with access of 90 percent of quota (SDR 78.3 million, $120 million).
Team: Messrs. Alturki, Abdychev, Schimmelpfennig (head), Sumlinski (all MCD), and
Stepanyan (SPR). Mr. Moers, the resident representative, assisted the mission. Mr. Jung (OED)
participated in the policy discussions.
Key Tajik officials: President Rakhmon, Prime Minister Akilov, State Economic Advisor
Davlatov, Minister of Finance Nadjmuddinov, and National Bank Chairman Rakhimzoda.
Fund relations: The Executive Board concluded the 2006 Article IV consultation on March 28,
2007. In response to the misreporting that was uncovered in late 2007, the Executive Board asked
that Tajikistan repay early all noncomplying disbursements. The six monthly repayments of
SDR 4.9 million were received through February 2009. Program implementation under the June–
December 2008 SMP was good.
Exchange system: Tajikistan has accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4
and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current
international transactions. The authorities’ exchange rate policy resembles a peg, and is classified
as “stabilized.” Going forward, the authorities are committed to a flexible exchange rate regime.
PRGF: In the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Polices (MEFP) attached to President
Rakhmon’s Letter of Intent (LOI), the authorities have indicated their intention to implement an
economic program covering the period April 1, 2009 to March 31, 2012.
Data: Despite some weaknesses, data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. Tajikistan
participates in the GDDS.
Outreach: The mission met with local representatives of the donor community, including the
Asian Development Bank, the World Bank, and the European Union, and briefed members of the
diplomatic community and NGOs. The mission also gave two press briefings.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Economic developments in 2008 were favorable, and the authorities completed the
SMP. Activity expanded strongly, and inflation receded. The authorities overperformed on
the indicative targets on the overall fiscal balance and net international reserves. They also
made progress on their structural reform agenda, broadly as envisaged.
Tajikistan faces an external shock that is being compounded by domestic problems.
Remittances and exports are projected to decline sharply, requiring a significant external
adjustment in 2009. Moreover, Tajikistan’s growth potential is constrained by government
interference in markets, and poor energy and transport infrastructure. Despite recent gains,
poverty remains widespread.
The authorities plan to:
•

Facilitate external adjustment through exchange rate flexibility, while providing for
sufficient fiscal resources to meet growing social spending needs.

•

Follow up on the recommendations from the special audit of the National Bank of
Tajikistan.

•

Continue with structural reforms and the public investment program—financed by
grants or concessional external borrowing—to strengthen Tajikistan’s growth
potential.

Staff agrees with the authorities’ policy strategy and notes:
•

Macroeconomic policies may need to be tightened further if external developments
turn out worse than currently projected. Alternatively, additional donor support could
ease the domestic adjustment burden.

•

Quick progress is needed on strengthening governance at the National Bank of
Tajikistan to restore its credibility and improve the effectiveness of monetary policy.

•

Tangible progress is also needed in other structural reform areas, notably agriculture
and state-owned enterprises to minimize fiscal risks and strengthen the economy’s
resilience.

•

Fiscal sustainability can be maintained only if public investment projects yield the
expected growth dividend. Tajikistan remains at high risk of debt distress.

I. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
1.
Adverse external developments are expected to lead to a deterioration in
economic conditions. Despite progress toward poverty reduction, 53 percent of the
population was below the poverty line of $41/month and 17 percent were below the extreme
poverty line of $26/month in 2007. The expected economic slowdown in 2009 and the
possible return of migrant workers (around 1 million out of a population of 7 million, or
almost half the labor force, worked outside Tajikistan in 2008) will add to the existing
problem of widespread

taking on debt. As such, the
government is facing spending pressures in 2009 to safeguard living conditions and support
growth.
2.
Staff reached agreement ad referendum on a three-year program that could be
supported under the PRGF. Tajikistan’s external position is projected to worsen in 2009
because of the deteriorating global and regional economic environment. Noting the
helpfulness of past Fund advice (Box 1), the authorities want to benefit from the stability that
a Fund financial arrangement would bring, and expect that formal Fund involvement will
unlock budget support from the Asian Development Bank (AsDB), the World Bank, and the
European Union. Staff believes that the PRGF is the appropriate facility given that many of
Tajikistan’s underlying problems are structural, though the external shocks in 2009 will
require upfront adjustment.
The PRGF request follows completion of the 2008 SMP. The SMP was put in
place after a misreporting episode uncovered in late 2007 had seriously undermined the
credibility of the authorities. 1 The episode involved the provision of inaccurate data to the
Fund on the level of international reserves and net domestic assets of the National Bank of
Tajikistan (NBT), and the issuance of directed credit by the NBT over a six-year period

through 2007. On March 5, 2008, the Executive Board supported the Managing Director’s
recommendation that Tajikistan repay early the three noncomplying disbursements
(amounting to SDR 29.4 million) that had not already been discharged under MDRI relief.
Box 1. The Authorities’ Response to Past Fund Advice
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

The authorities have maintained a prudent fiscal stance, but deficits of state-owned
enterprises have remained high and nontransparent, despite some recent progress.
The authorities adopted an external debt strategy in 2008 that sets a debt ceiling of
40 percent of GDP, in line with staff advice.
Monetary policy effectiveness continues to be constrained by a lack of appropriate
instruments and weak institutional capacity.
While a managed-floating exchange rate was maintained de jure, the NBT has de
facto pegged the somoni against the U.S. dollar until very recently.
Key Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) recommendations are being
addressed, with World Bank assistance.
NBT recapitalization and adoption of an anti-money laundering framework are still
pending.
Progress on agricultural (in particular, cotton) sector reforms has been poor.

II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE 2008 SMP
4.
Economic developments in 2008 were positive, despite a severe winter, a
prolonged drought, and electricity shortages. Real GDP growth reached 8 percent in 2008,
mainly driven by remittance-financed demand in the services and construction sectors, and
noncotton agricultural production. Inflation receded from its mid-year peak to 11 percent
year-on-year in February 2009, helped by the recent retrenchment in international commodity
prices. With strong domestic demand, the trade balance worsened in 2008. Imports grew by
around 36 percent, partly reflecting high international food and energy prices in the first half
of the year, while exports were held back by sluggish industrial activity. Despite this, the
overall balance of payments registered a surplus in 2008 as remittances surged by 50 percent.
5.
The authorities achieved an overall fiscal surplus of 1 percent of GDP (excluding
the externally financed public investment program, PIP) in 2008, compared to a target
of overall balance under the SMP. Revenues were buoyant, mostly reflecting high nominal
GDP and import growth, as well as some administrative gains. At the same time, the
authorities maintained strict expenditure control. Disbursements of concessional external
financing for the planned investment projects under the PIP were within the program ceiling,
and there was no new borrowing. Despite the expanding PIP, the overall deficit remained at
about 6 percent of GDP broadly unchanged from 2007, and total public and publicly

7
guaranteed debt declined to 29 percent of GDP from 34 percent in 2007. The authorities
avoided accumulating new gross arrears with the exception of tax arrears by the power utility
Barki Tajik, which have been a perennial problem in recent years.2

New arrears arose largely from noncollection from consumers, including the ministry of land and water
resources, and the nonpayment of penalties to the Revenue Authority. In general, tax arrears are part of a more
complex problem of cross arrears. For example, a part of Barki Tajik’s outstanding stock of arrears are the
counterpart of arrears of Talco to Barki Tajik.

The NBT built net international reserves above its SMP target, while containing
monetary growth. The strong inflow of remittances allowed the NBT to accumulate
$125 million in net international reserves during 2008 to a level of $181 million at
end-December. 3 However, gross international reserves of $199 million covered only
1.2 month of imports. Foreign exchange market purchases helped contain appreciation
pressures on the somoni, given the authorities’ concerns about competitiveness. These
interventions also served to provide liquidity to the banking system in the absence of other
effective monetary policy instruments. Reserve money growth slowed, mainly because of an
accumulation of government deposits at the NBT that offset the provision of short-term
liquidity loans to banks toward the end of 2008.
7.
•

The authorities made progress on their 2008 structural reform agenda:
Ernst & Young (London) completed the special audit of the NBT, and the authorities
will publish the Executive Summary once the auditors have released the final report
(Box 2).

•

The ministry of finance has established a contingent liability-reporting regime for
state-owned enterprises (SOEs), public institutions, and the NBT with the assistance
of the FAD regional adviser.

•

The authorities have prepared amendments to the NBT and commercial banking laws
with assistance from the World Bank to address key recommendations of the FSAP
report with delays for reasons explained in IMF Country Report No. 08/382. The
amendments will be submitted to parliament in April.

•

The ministry of finance has issued a regulation requiring official identification and
disclosure of beneficial owners of companies registered with its Agency for
Securities.

•

The NBT has discontinued its previous practice of issuing cotton export licenses.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS

8.
Policy discussions for the Article IV consultations focused on three main issues
and laid the groundwork for the proposed 2009–12 program for which the authorities
seek support under the PRGF.
•
3

Facilitating external adjustment in 2009 while allowing for rising social spending needs;

Gross and net reserves exclude pledged deposits of the NBT with foreign commercial banks. By the end of
2008, all pledges had been retained.

12
•

Laying the foundation for medium-term growth and ensuring that there is no build-up of
external debt; and

•

Structural reforms in the areas of central bank governance, state-owned enterprises, and
the agriculture sector.

Box 2. Report on Special Audit of the NBT
The special audit report, prepared by E&Y, confirms governance weaknesses at the
NBT, Kredit Invest, and cotton investors. The auditors confirmed the misreporting to the
Fund. They noted that their work was constrained by limited, incomplete, and unreliable
information, and complicated by the destruction and fabrication of documents. The auditors
also found some misclassification of loans on the NBT balance sheet, and could not confirm
all activity by Kredit Invest. As such, they concluded that “there is no audited, reliable basis
for NBT’s current balance sheet.” In this context, they noted that net international reserves
data could not be ascertained for April 30, 2008, since some confirmations by third parties
were not received by E&Y. The auditors also commended the current NBT Chairman for
improving governance since taking office in early 2008. The previous NBT Chairman took
full responsibility for ordering selected NBT staff to arrange pledges, guarantees and loans,
and conceal them from the external auditors and the IMF. He explained that this was to ensure
funding for Tajikistan’s cotton sector, a key source of employment in rural areas. The auditors
noted that, regarding the role of the former NBT Chairman, “There is evidence to indicate that
there was a conflict of interest.”
The special audit report found that the NBT pledges and guarantees that were part of
the misreporting episode were not disclosed to PricewaterhouseCoopers, the external
auditors for the 2007 accounts and earlier years. Therefore, PricewaterhouseCoopers did
not contact all of the relevant institutions that had extended credits to the cotton sector. It is
not known why the financial institutions that were contacted did not disclose the existence of
the pledges and guarantees.

A. Macroeconomic Policies for 2009
9.
External shocks and domestic rigidities are expected to take a heavy toll on
Tajikistan in 2009. Remittances are projected to decline in 2009 by 30 percent (Box 3),
while exports (cotton, aluminum) are likely to contract by 7 percent in value terms, owing to
lower international prices. This will require a large balance of payments adjustment, and may
trigger further pressures on the exchange rate. This year, the somoni has already depreciated
by 8 percent against the U.S. dollar through end-February. Moreover, domestic demand is

14
likely to weaken. On the supply side, ongoing electricity rationing, a difficult international
market for aluminum and cotton, and expected water shortages during the agricultural season
are weighing on growth. 4 In all, staff projects real GDP growth in 2009 at only 2 percent at
best. The authorities see some upside risks, pointing to positive impulses from the continuing
shift toward noncotton agriculture and from government spending. Inflation is likely to
stabilize around 13 percent in 2009, as the positive impact of declining international
commodity prices is offset by the impact of the likely somoni depreciation.
Box 3. Remittances and Growth Spillovers
Remittances are expected to be the main channel through which the global economic
downturn will affect Tajikistan. Estimated at 47 percent of GDP for 2008, remittances
have been the largest source of current inflows during the last several years, supporting
domestic demand and allowing the NBT to accumulate reserves. A large share of Tajik
migrant workers is employed in the Russian construction sector. With Russia projected to
contract in 2009, remittances inflows in Tajikistan are expected to decline, as migrant
workers are laid off or see their U.S. dollar wages fall. In January 2009, remittances
contracted by 22 percent year-on-year.

10.
Macroeconomic policies need to be geared primarily at maintaining external
stability. The authorities view the exchange rate as the primary instrument for facilitating
external adjustment. Fiscal policy needs to accommodate the expected demands for social
spending, and the authorities believe that the overall fiscal deficit target (excluding PIP) of
½ percent of GDP set out in their 2009 budget remains appropriate.

4

Since late 2008, Talco is reportedly not achieving cost recovery and inventories have increased. Likewise,
cotton inventories have built up. Moreover, Uzbekistan, a key supplier of gas, has recently halved its exports to
Tajikistan and raised the gas price by 65 percent in 2009.

15
11.
The authorities have committed to a flexible exchange rate regime. An assessment
of the level of the exchange rate suggests that, in light of the already large current account
deficit in 2008, the somoni could be overvalued (Box 4). This is compounded by the external
shock expected for 2009. As such, the authorities have discontinued their policy—in place
since 1998—of a de facto peg to the U.S. dollar and plan to let the somoni move in line with
market pressures to bring about the necessary external adjustment in 2009, and return the
current account deficit to a more sustainable level over the medium term. At the same time,
they will seek to reduce excess volatility in the foreign exchange market, including by
purchasing foreign exchange during temporary episodes of inflows.
12.
Given the need for exchange rate flexibility, the authorities will target reserve
money growth as a nominal anchor. The authorities are concerned about liquidity shortages
in the banking sector. They expect that they will have to continue providing short-term
liquidity loans (with a maturity of up to three months) at the refinancing rate. Staff suggested
to lower the reserve requirement, e.g., by reducing the reserve requirement for foreign
exchange deposits to that of somoni deposits, as an alternative way of providing liquidity.
However, the authorities were concerned that lowering the reserve requirement on foreign
exchange deposits would lead to an increase in deposit dollarization, and felt that liquidity
loans―or the issuance of certificates of deposits―would be sufficient to control reserve
money growth.
13.
Fiscal policy will have to provide space for additional social spending. The
revenue-to-GDP ratio is expected to decline by close to 1½ percent of GDP in 2009, mainly
reflecting sluggish activity. At the same time, the authorities intend to raise social spending
on transfers to households, health, and education by almost 1½ percent of GDP consistent
with their PRSP and the last JSAN (IMF Country Reports 09/82 and 09/83)―they are
working closely with the World Bank in these areas. Moreover, they plan to continue
implementing their civil service reform strategy, also developed in consultation with the
World Bank, which involves right-sizing the civil service workforce and increasing
government wages. Low salaries, below the living wage, were a hindrance to attracting
qualified staff and are likely to foster corruption. 5 To achieve their overall fiscal deficit target
of ½ percent of GDP (excluding PIP), they will, therefore, delay domestically financed
capital spending, while focusing expenditures on key infrastructure bottlenecks and other
high priority items. Included in these projections is an allowance for nonrecovery of loans

16
extended in 2008 to the cotton sector through commercial banks. 6 In 2009, the lending
scheme amounts to $45 million (almost 1 percent of GDP).
14.
The authorities are concerned about rising financial sector vulnerabilities.
Headline financial soundness indicators have improved during 2008. However, some banks
faced severe funding problems towards the end of 2008 due to some large corporates drawing
down their deposits, a drying up of trade credits and advances for remittances, and rising
nonperforming loans. 7 In response, most banks have started to raise deposit rates and
constrained credit growth. In addition, the NBT has provided liquidity loans, mainly in
somoni. Against this background, staff updated the FSAP stress tests with end-2008 data
(Box 5). The results suggest that banks are vulnerable to a large depreciation of the somoni
and the risk of a deposit run. To safeguard the banking system, the authorities are stepping up
supervision and regulatory requirements, and are also following up on indications that some
banks’ may not be fully compliant with regulatory requirements or not provisioning
adequately (MEFP ¶16).
15.
The authorities and staff agreed that there are significant downside risks to the
projections. The decline in remittances could be larger than anticipated, shortages in power
and water supply could affect industry, services and agriculture by more than expected, and
world market conditions for Tajikistan’s key exports aluminum and cotton could worsen
further. 8 The authorities are monitoring external developments closely, and stand ready to
further tighten policies if needed or to avoid an overshooting of the exchange rate that could
adversely affect the banking system. However, they also note the trade-off between further
expenditure restraints and the need to improve Tajikistan’s infrastructure, as well as to
continue ongoing reforms even at a fiscal cost.

6

As of mid-February 2009, 32 percent of loans had been repaid to the budget. The final repayment period is
April 1, 2009.

8

Quantitatively, trade credits are less important, covering only around 1 percent of imports in September 2008.

For example, the aluminum smelter Talco accounts for 3 percent of real GDP and 25 percent of exports, and
employs around 11,000 people. Several other smelters owned by large international firms were already forced to
close during 2008. So far, Talco has continued operations by relying on its cash buffer, building inventories, and
reducing capacity utilization.

17

Box 4. Exchange Rate Assessment
During 2008, the somoni appreciated in nominal and real effective terms, mainly
driven by large remittances inflows. The NBT limited the nominal appreciation against
the U.S. dollar to about 2 percent in 2008 through foreign exchange market interventions.
However, given the nominal depreciation of key trading partners against the U.S. dollar
(e.g., the Russian ruble) and inflation differentials with other trading partners, the real
effective exchange rate (REER) appreciated by 14 percent. The current account deficit
remained high at 9 percent of GDP.

The three Consultative Group on Exchange Rates (CGER) approaches suggest that
the somoni could be overvalued. Using 2008 data, point estimates range from the
somoni being broadly in line with fundamentals to being overvalued by 18 percent,
reflecting the usual statistical uncertainty around such estimates. Assuming a constant
REER, the medium-term balance of payments projections would show significant
external financing needs, also pointing to an overvaluation of the somoni.

Box 5. Updated Banking Sector Stress Tests
This box updates the FSAP stress tests of the Tajik banking system using end-2008
data.1 Banks included in the update account for 95 percent of total assets. The simulated
shocks are exceptional, but plausible, and may have particular relevance during the period
ahead (Tables 8 and 9).
Banks are long in foreign exchange, but exchange rate movements could trigger credit
events. At end-2008, deposit dollarization was 64 percent, loan dollarization 56 percent, and
banks’ net open foreign exchange position was 6 percent of capital (long). As such, a
depreciation of the somoni would not directly have an adverse effect on banks’ balance
sheets. However, most debtors who have foreign exchange denominated loans are neither
hedged nor have foreign exchange earnings, so that banks face a credit risk if the somoni
depreciates. Moreover, banks’ asset quality may already be impaired by the doubling of
lending to the cotton sector to 17 percent of total outstanding loans during 2008. The stress
test assumes a 30 percent depreciation against U.S. dollar with and without a concomitant
30 percent deterioration in the foreign exchange loan portfolio. In the first case, the system’s
capital adequacy ratio (CAR) actually improves, given banks’ long foreign exchange
position. However, in the second, more plausible case, the system’s CAR falls by
3 percentage points, and two banks slip below the required minimum of 12 percent.
Banks’ vulnerability to a liquidity shock has increased compared to end-2007.
Developments in the fourth quarter of 2008 point to liquidity shortages in the system. The
stress test assumes a hypothetical deposit run of 10 percent of deposits per day for five
consecutive days. The results suggest that liquidity shortfalls appear manageable, though
individual banks may face liquidity shortages. Liquidity shortages would be higher in case
of a foreign exchange deposit withdrawal than in case of a somoni deposit withdrawal.

Republic of Tajikistan: Financial System Stability Assessment, including Reports on Observance of Standards
and Codes on the following topics, Banking Supervision, and Monetary and Financial Policy Transparency,
December 2008 (IMF Country Report No. 08/371).

B. Medium-Term Outlook and Debt Sustainability Analysis
16.
Tajikistan’s medium-term economic outlook hinges on external developments
and reforms to strengthen the supply side potential. Real GDP growth should rebound in
line with global trends, and can return to a range of 5–7 percent if domestic bottlenecks in
energy, infrastructure, and the investment climate are eased. The authorities’ plans to increase
power generation capacity with new hydropower projects and build new road links within the

19
country and to regional trading partners should help in this regard. 9 With the expected
exchange rate adjustment, the external current account deficit should decline to about
3 percent of GDP by 2014. This, combined with the projected donor support, would allow a
build-up of gross international reserves to about three months of imports.
17.
The government’s borrowing strategy appears viable, but Tajikistan’s risk of
debt distress remains high. The authorities intend to eliminate the modest overall fiscal
deficit (excluding PIP) by 2012, and strengthen the debt management function, including
through the regular reporting on external debt. External borrowing would be restricted to the
PIP at concessional terms. With this, the authorities remain committed to their external debt
ceiling of 40 percent of GDP (MEFP ¶23), which they have set in line with the
recommendations from the 2007 debt sustainability analysis (DSA). The updated DSA finds
that the authorities’ strategy keeps public and public external and externally guaranteed debt
at sustainable levels (Supplement). 10 However, the DSA also finds that the outlook remains
vulnerable to adverse macroeconomic shocks. The DSA also underlines the need to carefully
scrutinize individual investment projects to ensure that they will yield the intended growth
dividends. Lastly, a one-off increase in the government’s debt obligations, e.g., related to the
cotton debt resolution and NBT recapitalization, would push the debt-to-GDP ratio just above
its respective threshold for the first six years, but would not put the country on an
unsustainable debt path in the long run.
C. Structural Reforms
18.
The authorities’ structural reform agenda for 2009 and beyond is outlined in the
second poverty reduction strategy (PRS2) and the attached LOI and MEFP for 2009-12.
The PRS2 presented a three-year plan for 2007–09 that operationalizes the authorities’ 2006–
15 National Development Strategy in three main areas: (a) improvement of public
administration; (b) promotion of sustained economic growth; and (c) development of human
potential. 11 During 2009, the authorities want to strengthen key economic institutions and
begin to lay the foundation for sustained economic growth. In particular, they plan to address
governance issues at the NBT and major SOEs, and continue with ongoing reforms in
revenue administration, expenditure policy, and public financial management. They will also
push forward reforms in the agricultural and energy sectors.

9

The authorities are also pursuing a regional dialogue to strengthen energy security.

10

The DSA was carried out in collaboration with the World Bank, and with the AsDB as an observer.

11

See also the Joint Staff Advisory Note (IMF Country Report No. 09/83).

20
Monetary and Financial Area
19.
Reforms at the NBT will be guided by the recommendations from the special
audit (MEFP ¶12–14). External audits of net international reserves and the NBT’s financial
statements for the fiscal year ending April 2009 will be used to establish a new accounting
baseline, develop a strategy to clean up the NBT’s balance sheet, and assess recapitalization
needs. In addition, the authorities intend to enhance governance structures by strengthening
the internal audit function, amending the NBT and commercial banks’ laws, and closing
down the cotton debt department. 12
20.
The authorities are taking steps to enhance the liquidity provision framework.
So far, the NBT has relied on its own certificates of deposit and short-term loans to manage
liquidity. Given the projected increasing need for liquidity injections in 2009, the authorities
will introduce a statutory overnight credit facility, a seven-day deposit facility, and restrict
other liquidity loans to a maturity of up to three months (MEFP ¶15). In this context, they
will define a list of adequate collateral. These new instruments will strengthen the
effectiveness of monetary policy and allow the NBT to better achieve its program objectives.
Plans are also progressing to introduce tradable government securities that should further
enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy (MEFP ¶14).
Fiscal Area
21.
Tax policy and revenue administration reforms are progressing. The authorities
are working on the remaining regulations to fully implement the 2005 Tax Code that was
developed with Fund assistance (MEFP ¶18). The authorities also intend to focus on
strengthening the value-added tax (VAT), and in particular improve the functioning of the
refund system (MEFP ¶19). Work is also continuing to strengthen taxpayer facilitation
(MEFP ¶20). Lastly, with the 2010 budget, the authorities hope to tackle the problem of
existing cross arrears (MEFP ¶21).
22.
Public financial management reforms will seek to strengthen expenditure control
(MEFP ¶22). A first step in this direction was taken with the establishment of a cash
management unit. Next, the authorities will develop and promulgate commitment control
instructions. To enhance budget transparency and ensure that spending will better correspond
to policy priorities, budget appropriations will be presented based on an administrative
classification starting with the 2010 budget law.

12

The amendments to the NBT and commercial banks’ laws have been prepared with World Bank assistance.

21
State-Owned Enterprises and Agriculture
23.
SOEs constitute a fiscal risk. Financial operations are not transparent and some
SOEs are burdened with quasi-fiscal operations. The newly established SOE supervision unit
in the ministry of finance will closely monitor the ten largest SOEs (MEFP ¶24). External
audits of the SOEs and the submission of financial performance plans for 2010 are key steps
in this direction. For Talco, staff encourages the authorities to contract a reputable
international auditing firm for the company’s 2007–09 financial statements, and also tender
an external audit of Talco Management Company, Talco’s off-shore tolling partner. 13 It will
also be important to continue with the scheduled electricity tariff adjustments agreed with the
World Bank with a view to reaching cost recovery at the power utility Barki Tajik in 2011,
while ensuring that the most vulnerable segments of the population have access to a basic
minimum of energy services (MEFP ¶25).
24.
Cotton sector reforms are crucial to unlocking the growth potential in the
agriculture sector (Box 6). The authorities noted the positive growth impulse from
noncotton agriculture in 2008, but also emphasized that cotton can be a profitable crop in
certain areas of Tajikistan. They are determined to finalize their strategy for resolving the
existing cotton debt problem that inhibits the sector’s dynamics, and have hired an
independent consultant—financed by the World Bank—to prepare a comprehensive strategy
to take the sector forward (MEFP ¶27). In parallel, they are working to reduce government
interference in farmers’ crop choice, and establish a private-sector led financing mechanism,
including through the use of land rights as collateral.
Technical Assistance
25.
In support of their reform efforts, the authorities have requested technical
assistance (TA) from the Fund in a number of areas. In the monetary area, they seek TA
on reforms at the NBT following up on the special audit, recapitalization, and liquidity
provision. In the fiscal area, follow-up TA on public financial management is needed. In
addition, the authorities would benefit from TA on VAT administration, and making the SOE
supervision unit fully operational. 14 Lastly, the authorities would welcome TA on national
accounts and price statistics; a regional statistical advisor has pointed to several weaknesses
in these areas.

13

Under the tolling arrangement, Talco receives a fixed fee for processing the inputs provided by Talco
Management Company. The ownership structure of Talco Management Company, which is headquartered in the
British Virgin Islands, has not been disclosed publicly, but the government of Tajikistan reportedly has a
majority interest in the company.
14

The European Union has offered financing for the latter.

22
Box 6. Tajikistan’s Cotton Sector
Role in the economy: About 50 percent of the active population is employed in the
cotton sector, and 35 percent of irrigated agricultural land is used for cotton. However,
cotton accounts for only around 4 percent of GDP and 13 percent of total exports. The
sector has seen a steady decline in productivity and profitability, largely due to
mismanagement, poor regulation and governance, and excessive state interference.
Cotton debt problem: By end-2008, cotton farmers are reported to have accumulated
over $400 million in debt to cotton investors. These investors exploited their position
as monopsonists in the domestic cotton market and monopolists in financing and
supplying inputs to farmers.1 Since 2001, investors were able to access financing from
different state-owned financial institutions that in turn received guarantees from the
NBT. Since 2004, Kredit Invest played the role of lending to investors using NBT
guarantees and direct loans from the NBT in domestic and foreign currency. As of end2008, the outstanding loans and guarantees by the NBT to Kredit Invest amounted to
about US$575 million.
Recent reforms:
•
In 2007, the government passed Decree 111 to address the distortions in cotton
production, including by allowing farmers to choose the crops they grow and
using land rights as collateral. The reforms were supported by donors, but
implementation of the decree has been slow.
•
In 2008, the government introduced a new financing scheme whereby the
government lends funds to commercial banks at below-market interest rates for
onlending to specific cotton farms.
Macroeconomics of cotton: Because of the pre-2008 cotton financing mechanism,
Tajikistan lost significant international reserves and experienced a large expansion of
the monetary base. The new financing scheme puts the banking system at risk in case of
a worsening of asset quality, which now seems likely given the sharp decline in
international cotton prices.
Assistance from other donors: The World Bank is providing advice on agricultural
policy. The AsDB focuses on strengthening the market structure and infrastructure for
agricultural products.
__________________

The situation was also aggravated by a rapid post-war restructuring of farms, which has led to
inconsistencies in classifications of outstanding debt, as well as to its limited documentation.

23
D. Program Design and Risks
26.
Based on the discussions for the 2009 Article IV consultation, the authorities
have developed a 2009–12 program for which they seek support under the PRGF. In
2009, the program’s main objective is maintaining external stability in the face of a severe
balance-of-payments shock. By the end of the program period, the authorities aim to have
restored growth, reduced inflation to single digits, maintained public external debt below
40 percent of GDP (net present value terms), and raised gross international reserves to cover
more than three months of imports. During the initial phase of the program, structural
reforms will mainly seek to address the concerns raised in the report on the special audit of
the NBT. Over the full course of the program, they intend to recapitalize the NBT, improve
the financial health of SOEs, strengthen the agricultural sector, and continue ongoing efforts
in the fiscal area.
27.
Specifically, the proposed program includes quantitative performance criteria,
indicative targets, and structural benchmarks that are initially set for June and
December 2009. The quantitative performance criteria:
•

Safeguard external stability (floor on net international reserves, zero ceiling on new
external payments arrears, ceiling on disbursement of concessional external debt, zero
ceiling on contracting or guaranteeing nonconcessional external debt), and maintain
monetary control (ceiling on net domestic assets).

•

Ensure fiscal sustainability (ceiling on the overall fiscal deficit excluding PIP, zero
ceiling on general government wage and pension arrears).

The indicative targets support these quantitative performance criteria by:
•

Setting a floor on revenue collection.

•

Setting a floor on social- and poverty-related expenditure designed in close
cooperation with the World Bank.

Prior actions and structural benchmarks serve to monitor progress on the authorities’ reform
agenda and provide assurances to the Fund that the problems underlying the recent
misreporting episode are addressed (Table 2 attached to President Rakhmon’s LOI). The first
review based on end-June 2009 performance would take place in September/October 2009,
once the safeguards assessment has been completed, and will focus on reforms at the NBT,
including the follow-up on the recommendations from the special audit and steps to
strengthen the NBT’s liquidity management framework, and resolution of cotton debt issues.
28.
Even with the proposed policies, Tajikistan faces an external financing gap in
2009. Remittances inflows are expected to decline by around $720 million and exports by

24
around $60 million, and the authorities are basing their projections on conservative
assumptions for private capital account inflows. The authorities expect that slower growth
and the drop in international commodity prices will lead to a contraction of imports by
20 percent ($680 million). With this, staff’s preliminary assessment is that Tajikistan faces an
external financing gap of at least $154 million. This would be partly filled by expected
budget support from the AsDB ($40 million), the European Union ($24 million), and the
World Bank ($20 million). The remainder could be filled by frontloading the proposed access
of 90 percent of quota (SDR 78.3, $120 million) with a disbursement of SDR 45 million
($70 million) in 2009.
29.
Staff believes that the proposed access level is justified and balances different
concerns. Tajikistan is being hit by a severe external shock, and Fund and donor support is
needed to assist the authorities manage the resulting substantial external adjustment need. As
the DSA shows, the external public debt, including the proposed borrowing from the Fund, is
projected to fall gradually toward more sustainable levels, but the risk of debt distress
remains high. Thus, while Fund support can play a useful role, Tajikistan should primarily
rely on grants and highly concessional borrowing over the medium term. The program
design, particularly the reforms at the NBT and in the agricultural sector, are expected to
address the institutional shortcomings that were at the root of the previous misreporting
episode.
30.
Tajikistan is expected to meet its financial obligations to the Fund in a timely
manner, but there would be some risk to Fund resources stemming from the country’s
fragile external position. Tajikistan has an established record of timely servicing its
obligations to the Fund. With respect to capacity to repay, outstanding purchases would be
manageable in absolute terms, and debt service to the Fund would remain below 0.2 percent
of exports of goods and nonfactor services by the end of the program period.
31.
A safeguards assessment should be completed at the time of the first review. The
last safeguards assessment of the NBT was completed on July 23, 2003. The update would be
based on the progress of the external audit of the NBT’s financial statements for the fiscal
year ending April 30, 2009, and the documents provided by the NBT for review.
32.
In light of Tajikistan’s history of misreporting, the program is subject to the risk
that the authorities return to the costly errors of the past. To guard against this risk, the
program includes strong actions, in particular the implementation of all recommendation of
the NBT’s special audit report. Moreover, regular and timely publication of the audit reports
of the NBT’s financial statements, and the Fund’s upcoming safeguards assessment should
also serve as safety measures.
33.
The program is also subject to economic and implementation risks. First, a further
deterioration in the international economic environment, including a more severe regional

25
economic slowdown, would affect Tajikistan’s narrow export base and remittances inflows.
In addition, the global financial crisis could continue to affect Tajikistan’s banking sector
through indirect channels. With respect to program implementation, vested interests have, in
the past, adversely affected the quality of reforms and may continue to do so in the future.
Finally, institutional capacity remains weak, despite significant improvements in recent years,
and can constrain the speed and quality of reforms.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
Economic performance in 2008 was good. Real GDP grew strongly, while inflation
receded from its August 2008 peak. With buoyant remittances and activity, the authorities
met all quantitative targets under the SMP with only one exception. The government largely
saved the revenue overperformance and achieved an overall fiscal surplus (excluding PIP)
higher than targeted under the program. The associated build-up of government deposits at
the NBT helped the NBT contain monetary growth while accumulating international reserves
at a faster pace than envisaged. Taken together, the authorities succeeded in building buffers,
albeit only small ones.
35.
In 2009, Tajikistan faces severe external shocks that are aggravated by domestic
problems. The projected decline in remittances and exports requires a significant external
adjustment, and will take a toll on economic activity. Also, pervasive power shortages and
possible irrigation bottlenecks are holding back growth. These adverse developments are
compounded by a poor investment climate, widespread government interference in the
economy—in particular in the agricultural sector—as well as poor infrastructure and skill
shortages.
36.
Exchange rate flexibility is crucial to achieving the necessary external
adjustment. In the short run, the somoni will have to at least broadly follow trends in key
trading partners’ currencies against the U.S. dollar to maintain competitiveness. Monetary
policy needs to contain reserve money growth as a nominal anchor. In this regard, the
authorities’ plans to strengthen the liquidity management framework are welcome steps to
expand their arsenal of monetary policy instruments, and the gradual issuance of tradable
government securities will further facilitate monetary policy operations. Over the medium
term, the REER will need to depreciate further to return the current account deficit to a more
sustainable level.
37.
Based on current projections, the authorities’ proposed fiscal stance is
appropriate. Tajikistan is one of the poorest countries in the world, and the government
needs to raise social spending in the face of the expected decline in real per-capita income. In
this regard, the government’s cooperation with the World Bank to ensure that social
assistance is well targeted is welcome. Given the expected revenue shortfalls relative to the
budget, this implies that the government will have to delay some capital projects, while
moving ahead with the civil service reform. The authorities can draw down some of its

26
deposits at the NBT, but timely disbursement of donor support is also crucial to meet
government’s financing needs.
38.
Tajikistan’s banking sector is vulnerable. With the economic slowdown, and in
particular the slump in the cotton sector, asset quality is expected to deteriorate in 2009,
while the system already suffers from liquidity shortages. Somoni depreciation will further
add to the stress in the banking sector. The authorities need to prepare contingency plans on
how to deal with distressed institutions and how to ensure adequate liquidity in the system,
while stepping up supervision to ensure that banks comply with regulatory requirements and
have adequate provisions. To provide a one-off boost to liquidity, the authorities could
consider harmonizing the reserve requirements at the lower rate of 9 percent.
39.
Risks to the short-term outlook are largely on the downside, and the authorities
need to stand ready to respond as needed. For example, if remittances were to decline by
an additional 5 percentage points in 2009, Tajikistan’s external financing needs would rise by
$110 million. As such, the authorities need to carefully monitor external developments,
including based on their monthly foreign exchange cash flow plan. If external financing
needs turn out larger than anticipated, or if foreign exchange inflows are lower than
projected, fiscal and monetary policy need to be tightened promptly to alleviate pressures on
the exchange rate and safeguard the banking system, unless additional donor support could be
mobilized. Indeed, timely disbursement of projected donor support is a precondition for the
success of the authorities’ strategy, and donors could consider stepping up their planned
support in 2009 given the difficult external outlook. Financial sector vulnerabilities constitute
another risk, and the authorities need continue their work on contingency planning.
40.
Over the medium term, Tajikistan can return to a high growth path. Maintaining
macroeconomic stability, removing bottlenecks in the energy sector, and eliminating
government interference, in particular in the agriculture sector are preconditions for achieving
the government’s real GDP growth objective of 7 percent. The DSA shows that the
government’s borrowing plans could be feasible, but only if the planned investment projects
yield the expected growth dividend. At the same time, the government needs to enhance the
quality and effectiveness of social spending to build on the welcome poverty reduction gains
over the last years.
41.
Staff supports the authorities’ request for an arrangement under the PRGF. The
arrangement would help the authorities achieve the objectives of their economic program. It
would also provide comfort to other donors who are increasing their support to Tajikistan that
sound economic policies are in place. There are risks to the program, but in light of the
authorities’ track record under the SMP and their commitment to take additional measures if
needed to achieve the program’s objectives, the new program has a good chance of success.

The next Article IV consultation with Tajikistan is expected to be completed
within the next 24 months in accordance with the Executive Board decision on the
consultation cycle for members with Fund arrangements.

APPENDIX: TAJIKISTAN: LETTER OF INTENT
March 31, 2009
His Excellency
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, N.W.
Washington, DC 20431

Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
I would like to express my gratitude to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for its support
of our economic reforms at this critical moment for our economy. I am delighted to inform
you that we have successfully concluded a Staff Monitored Program (SMP), covering the
period June 1–December 31, 2008. The SMP framework has helped us maintain
macroeconomic stability in a difficult external environment. In addition, we have started to
address the weaknesses exposed by the recent episode of misreporting, and we repaid all
noncomplying disbursements to the Fund.
It is our great concern that the external environment is adversely affecting Tajikistan’s
economy in 2009. The slowdown in Russia and Kazakhstan, has lead to a dramatic fall in
remittances inflow, while cotton and aluminum exports are being negatively affected by a
drop in demand and international prices. As a result, Tajikistan is experiencing severe fiscal
and external financing constraints, emerging stress in the banking system, and economic
activity is sluggish at best.
Against this background, during a February 5–18, 2009 mission we entered into discussions
with IMF staff on a new program that could be supported under the Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility (PRGF). I am pleased to inform you that we have reached understandings
with staff on a three-year program (April 1, 2009 to March 31, 2012). The program builds on
the foundation laid down by the SMP, and establishes a macroeconomic framework that will
support our efforts at economic stabilization and implementation of structural reforms. In
particular, the PRGF will help us address the problems faced by Tajikistan in the context of
the current global economic downturn. With the level of international reserves at a very
critical level, we require external assistance to build a more resilient and self-sustaining
economic structure, as well as reinforce our balance of payments position. Hence, at the core

44
of this PRGF program are measures aimed at safeguarding external and fiscal stability while
supporting growth and poverty reduction. The program thus includes a set of prior actions,
quantitative performance criteria, indicative targets, and structural benchmarks (outlined in
the attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) and the Technical
Memorandum of Understanding (TMU), to enable us to monitor progress in implementing
our reform agenda. We hereby kindly request the approval by the Executive Board of a threeyear PRGF program with access of 90 percent of Tajikistan’s quota covering the period
April 1, 2009–March 31, 2012. However, we would have preferred higher access.
The Government believes that the policies set forth in the attached MEFP are adequate to
achieve the objectives of its program, but it will take any further measures that may become
appropriate for this purpose. We will consult with the Fund on the adoption of these
measures and in advance of any revision to the policies contained in the MEFP, in accordance
with the Fund’s policies on such consultation. We intend to remain in close consultation with
Fund staff and provide timely information necessary for monitoring economic developments
and implementation of policies under the PRGF. In addition, the Government stands ready to
take any further measures that might be required to ensure that the overall objectives of the
program are attained.
In line with our commitment to transparency, we hereby request that the staff report,
this letter of intent, and the attached MEFP and TMU (including all annexes), as well as all
other PRGF-related documents, be published on the IMF website.
Your Excellency, please accept my assurances of my highest consideration,
/s/
Emomali Rakhmon
President of the Republic of Tajikistan

ATTACHMENT I. TAJIKISTAN: MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
(MEFP) FOR 2009-12
March 31, 2009
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This memorandum outlines the economic and financial policies of the Government of
Tajikistan for 2009–12. Our program aims at maintaining macroeconomic stability,
enhancing economic growth, and reducing poverty in the face of the ongoing global crisis
that will take a heavy toll on Tajikistan. These policies are also intended to form the basis for
a new three-year IMF-supported program under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF) and, we hope, will unlock further donor support.
2.
Tajikistan will be severely affected by the global crisis in 2009. The main
transmission channels are an expected dramatic decline in remittances and a decline in the
demand and price for our traditional exports aluminum and cotton. As a result, Tajikistan is
suffering a significant weakening of its external position, and we expect real GDP growth to
temporarily slow in 2009 below our target of 7 percent or more which we aim to achieve
again by the end of the program period.
3.
In this environment, our program focuses on safeguarding the macroeconomic
stability achieved under the Staff Monitored Program (SMP) in 2008, accelerating structural
reforms, supporting the poor and vulnerable segments of society, and enhancing the role of
the private sector in the economy. The policy framework for the proposed arrangement will
build on the measures that we implemented during the SMP, and draw, in particular, on the
findings and recommendations of the recently completed special audit of the National Bank
of Tajikistan (NBT), the 2007–08 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), and
ongoing technical assistance in the fiscal area.
4.
We have reached understandings with IMF staff on a set of prior actions, quantitative
performance criteria, indicative targets, and structural benchmarks for 2009. Macroeconomic
policies described in this memorandum are in line with our Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS,
2007–09), and our National Development Strategy (NDS, 2006–15), and will provide an
anchor for our new PRS (2010–12), for which we have recently started preparations with
assistance from donors.
II. MACROECONOMIC POLICES FOR 2009 AND BEYOND
5.
Macroeconomic policies in 2009 will be primarily geared toward maintaining external
stability. In line with currency movements of some of our main trading partners, the somoni
has already depreciated by 9 percent against the U.S. dollar year-to-date. We expect this trend

49

to continue, and believe that it will facilitate external adjustment by strengthening our export
competitiveness and shifting demand toward domestic producers. Fiscal policy will be in a
position to modestly support activity given expected donor support to the budget. We believe
that this policy mix will help us achieve a real GDP growth of 2-3 percent in 2009, which
will mainly come from the noncotton agriculture sector and public investment in
infrastructure. Still, given the expected decline in remittances, real per-capita income is likely
to contract for the first time in many years, and we will step up social spending to alleviate
the economic impact of the crisis.
6.
Given the external pressures, we will let the exchange rate depreciate in line with
market trends. The exchange rate will be the main instrument to bring about external
adjustment, and we expect to see most of the required depreciation to take place in the first
half of the year. The National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) will only seek to dampen volatility,
and we expect to keep net international reserves at $155 million at end-December 2009,
broadly the current level, and despite significant external pressures. To contain inflationary
pressures from the depreciation of the somoni, we target reserve money growth of 12 percent
in 2009, though we already see shortages in somoni and U.S. dollar liquidity in the system,
and expect these to increase during the course of the year.
7.
After achieving consecutive years of fiscal surplus (excluding the externally financed
public investment program, PIP), we will allow for a modest overall deficit (excl. PIP) in
2009. The 2009 budget targeted an overall deficit (excluding PIP) of ½ percent of GDP, and
we believe that this remains the appropriate fiscal stance. However, compared to budget
projections, we now expect a shortfall in revenues and grants of 3 percent of GDP, and
additional spending on account of the expected depreciation of the somoni. Moreover, we
need to allow for additional social spending on direct and indirect transfers of around
1 percent of GDP compared to 2008 to alleviate the immediate impact of the global crisis on
the population. We are working closely with the World Bank in this area, and expect to raise
social- and poverty-related spending to 9 percent of GDP in 2009. To achieve our deficit
target, we have therefore identified expenditure cuts of 1½ percent of GDP in current
spending (goods and services, subsidies and other current transfers), and of 2½ percent of
GDP in capital spending. If revenues or external donor support exceed our conservative
projections, we will consider moving ahead with some of the delayed capital projects. At the
same time, we will closely monitor external developments and stand ready to tighten fiscal
policies, in close consultation with IMF staff, if exchange rate movements alone are
insufficient to maintain external balance. We remain committed to an open trade regime, and
will refrain from increasing tariff or nontariff trade barriers.
8.
Tajikistan’s banking sector is affected by the global crisis through indirect channels.
The expected exchange rate depreciation could lead to a deterioration in loan quality since
debtors with U.S. dollar denominated loans do not necessarily have foreign exchange income.

50

Moreover, depositors could seek to convert somoni deposits into U.S. dollars or withdraw
from the banking system completely. We are therefore developing contingency plans in close
cooperation with IMF staff that would help us manage any stress that could emerge in the
banking system.
9.
In light of the tense external financing outlook, we have set up a joint crisis working
group at the deputy level between the NBT and ministry of finance. The working group has
developed a monthly foreign exchange cash plan for official flows that will assist us in
meeting our external obligations in a timely manner. The plan will be updated on a bi-weekly
basis, and the working group will monitor developments in the external and financial sector
closely to anticipate potential vulnerabilities early on and take appropriate policy responses.
The working group will liaise closely with the IMF’s resident representative.
10.
Looking beyond 2009, we hope that a more favorable external environment will pave
the way toward a resumption of growth. But even in this case, we expect to see a further
depreciation of Tajikistan’s real effective exchange rate that will help return the current
account deficit toward a more sustainable level. We also intend to significantly strengthen
our international reserves position, and target a reserve coverage of three months of imports
by 2014. In the fiscal area, we will continue to balance spending needs in the social area and
infrastructure projects, while broadly aiming for overall fiscal balance (excluding PIP).
III. STRUCTURAL REFORMS
11.
Structural reforms will seek to strengthen key institutions in the economic sphere, and
lay the foundation for sustained economic growth over the medium-term. In particular, the
program will address governance issues at the NBT and major state-owned enterprises
(SOEs). We will also push ahead with ongoing reforms in revenue administration and public
financial management. With assistance from the World Bank, we will continue with the
reforms in the health and education sectors, in order to meet the Millennium Development
Goals. Our reform agenda also includes steps to stimulate private investment, diversify our
export and production base, and raise productivity, including by addressing issues in the
agricultural and energy sectors.
A. Monetary and Financial Sector Reforms
12.
The special audit of the NBT has revealed governance deficiencies at the NBT, and
serious issues at Kredit Invest, and cotton investors. As indicated earlier, we will publish the
executive summary of the special audit report on the NBT’s website, for at least six months,
within one week after receiving the signed report from the Ernst & Young (prior action). As a
next step, we will then adopt a comprehensive and time-bound action plan to address all
issues and recommendations raised in the report, to be agreed with IMF staff (prior action).
This action plan will include (i) an external audit of the NBT’s net international reserves

51

position as of December 31, 2008 (prior action); (ii) appointing an audit firm to conduct the
external audit of the NBT’s financial statements for the fiscal year ending April 30, 2009 in
accordance with international standards on auditing (prior action); (iii) publishing the audited
financial statements together with the audit report for fiscal year 2009 prepared by the
external auditors (benchmark); (iv) strengthening the internal audit function at the NBT and
conducting quarterly internal audits that will be discussed by the NBT’s board (benchmark);
(v) closing down the cotton debt department at the NBT (benchmark); and (vi) cleaning up
the NBT’s balance sheet. We will share the report of the special audit of the NBT with the
appropriate law enforcement agencies who will assess whether there have been any legal
wrongdoings and act accordingly.
13.
We will also complete the outstanding SMP measure of submitting to Parliament a set
of amendments to the NBT and Commercial Banking Laws, as agreed at the time of the first
assessment of the SMP (prior action). These amendments go beyond the commitments made
under the SMP. Specifically, the amendments, which we have prepared with assistance from
the World Bank, include:
•

Changes to the terms of appointment and removal of board members: The NBT
Chairperson and his/her deputies will be appointed for fixed terms, which will not
coincide with the electoral cycle. Moreover, the reasons for their dismissal will be
clearly defined in the law.

•

Provisions for conflict of interest: We will introduce clear provisions for what
constitutes conflict of interest behavior and introduce sanctions to be applied in the
case of violations.

•

Disclosure of beneficial ownership: We will introduce requirements for the
identification and disclosure of beneficial ownership in financial institutions, after the
ministry of finance already introduced similar requirements for all companies
registered with its Agency for Securities.

14.
Once the above measures are in place, we will take steps to restore the financial
health of the NBT. At present, the NBT’s weak balance sheet limits its effectiveness in
implementing monetary policy. Moreover, the absence of marketable government securities
leaves the NBT mainly with its own certificates of deposits as instruments of monetary
policy. Therefore, we will establish a working group between the government and the NBT to
develop a strategy to recapitalize the NBT (benchmark), and steer the program for the
issuance of government securities (with Swiss and IMF support). The strategy will include a
memorandum of understanding that will guide NBT–ministry of finance relations, such as
appropriate remuneration of deposits and holdings of government securities. The strategy will
be agreed with IMF staff, and we request its technical assistance for this purpose.

52

15.
We recognize the high importance of completing a safeguards assessment of the NBT
by the first review of the PRGF. To that end, we will authorize our prospective external
auditors to hold discussions directly with IMF staff and to provide IMF staff with all
information requested in the context of the safeguards assessment. We further commit to
instructing the NBT to receive a safeguards mission from the IMF and to provide that mission
with all necessary cooperation and information required to complete the assessment by the
first review.
16.
In its monetary policy operations, the NBT will continue to refrain from issuing new
credits to the private sector, except for liquidity purposes or in cases of bank distress or
failure (lender of last resort). Specifically, we will restrict all lending to commercial banks,
credit unions, credit associations, and microfinance organizations to short-term liquidity
loans with a maturity of up to three months, and we will not extend any loans to domestic
nonbank financial institutions or any other domestic entity other than the general government.
In this context, the NBT will issue a circular that defines the terms of liquidity provision, to
be agreed with IMF staff (benchmark). We intend to introduce a statutory overnight credit
facility that can provide liquidity to qualifying banks in a prompt and effective manner,
subject to appropriate safeguards. We will also introduce a statutory seven-day deposit
facility.
17.
The NBT will continue to closely monitor potential vulnerabilities in the banking
system, not least in light of the possible impact of the global crisis. Supervisors will pay close
attention to banks’ loan classification, including through on-site visits, and will monitor the
financial soundness indicators collected in the Uniform Bank Performance Reports. In order
to decrease banks’ vulnerability to exchange rate changes, NBT will start applying higher
capital charges to foreign-currency denominated loans to unhedged borrowers. Furthermore,
prudential rules will be strictly enforced, without any exception, including on exposure limits
and reserve requirements. As is the case for all other commercial banks, we will now also
require the state savings bank (Amonat) to have an annual independent audit of its financial
statement. Moreover, all banks will be required to publish their annual audit reports with the
auditors’ opinion on their website. We are also working with the World Bank and the IMF to
establish an appropriate anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing framework
(AML/CFT), and intend to submit an AML/CFT law to parliament in 2010.
B. Reforms in the Fiscal Area
18.
With assistance from the World Bank, we will continue with our reforms of the civil
service, health care, and education sectors. In this connection, we continue to work with the
World Bank on the ultimate goal of adopting a competitive and affordable civil service wage
system. On health financing reform, we will continue with our strategy of allocating

53

resources in an asymmetric fashion favoring primary health care. On education, we will
continue with the implementation of our per capita funding pilot system.
19.
An efficient, equitable, and simple tax system can help stimulate innovation,
investment, and growth. In 2005, we have revamped Tajikistan’s tax code, and work is
ongoing to further strengthen the tax system. We will continue to draft and ratify the
remaining regulations for the Tax Code, prepare and disseminate all relevant information to
taxpayers, and introduce new operational procedures and forms. To take stock of the fiscal
impact of existing tax exemptions, we will include a report that assesses the costs and
benefits of existing tax exemptions during 2009 and 2010 in the 2010 budget.
20.
There is a need to strengthen the functioning of the value-added tax (VAT) system. In
particular, tax compliance procedures are excessively cumbersome, and there are problems
with the refund system. As such, we intend to (i) streamline the VAT exemptions for imports,
while making all VAT payments on imported fixed assets refundable; (ii) streamline the VAT
refund system for exports; and (iii) request technical assistance to assess weaknesses in the
existing VAT refund system and take remedial steps. In this regard, we have already
developed a software that will allow us to verify refund claims.
21.
We will also continue with our strategy of strengthening the capacity of the revenue
authorities by (i) introducing one-stop-shop facilities in the 68 tax inspectorates, including in
Dushanbe; (ii) enhancing the large tax payers inspectorate; (iii) establishing model tax
inspectorates in major centers; (iv) accelerating IT systems development and business process
reengineering; and (v) enhancing human resource management. We will seek donor
assistance for these reforms.
22.
Tax arrears remain a problem, and are concentrated in a few large SOEs. In this
regard, we have recently raised the penalty for tax arrears to 29 percent per annum
(0.08 percent per day—not compounded—from 0.05 percent per day). We will ensure that all
government entities will stay current on its payments to Barki Tajik. More generally, since
tax arrears are linked to a complicated web of cross-arrears, we will adopt a strategy to settle
these starting with the 2010 budget, and, going forward, to ensure that there is no renewed
build-up of tax arrears. The work of the SOE supervision unit in the ministry of finance
(below) will provide a basis for this strategy. We will also automatically link the penalty rate
to a market based lending rate, with a quarterly reset.
23.
We are pursuing steps to further enhance public financial management. We have
already set up a cash management unit that has strengthened expenditure controls. We will
now develop and promulgate instructions on commitment controls, and continue the
preparatory work toward introducing a single treasury account. To enhance transparency of
the budget and facilitate the political debate over spending priorities, we will include

54

appropriations according to administrative classification in the annual budget law, starting
with the 2010 law.
24.
We have taken strides to improve our debt management capacity and strategy. In
2008, we adopted an external debt strategy that sets a ceiling on the external debt-to-GDPratio of 40 percent. This is an upper limit, and we aim to keep external debt below the ceiling,
as we carefully scrutinize external borrowing plans and the economic impact of new
investment projects. In this regard, we will continue to refrain from contracting
nonconcessional debt and settle any external payment obligations of the general government
or the NBT in a timely fashion. We will continue to strengthen our debt data management
framework, including by completing an inventory of government domestic debt and
government-guaranteed debt of SOEs, and by publishing this report together with a report on
government and government-guaranteed external debt in the 2010 budget documents. We
will also publish semi-annual external debt reports on the website of the ministry of finance
(benchmark). In addition, the NBT will finalize the monitoring system of private external
debt, publish these data on the NBT website on a semi-annual basis, and share them with the
ministry of finance on a monthly basis.
C. State-Owned Enterprise, Agriculture, and Data
State-Owned Enterprises
25.
The SOE supervision unit of the ten largest SOEs that we established within the
ministry of finance last year will start working fully this year, and we are requesting IMF
technical assistance to expedite the process. 15 The unit should focus on putting SOEs on a
sound financial footing, improving their tax compliance, and eliminating quasi-fiscal deficits.
To this end, the unit will require SOEs to submit their financial performance plans for 2010
for approval together with a corporate intent statement (benchmark). An important step in
this direction will also be the publication of an annual report on the financial health of SOEs
on the ministry of finance website. Supporting this, the ministry of finance will also publish
the 2008 annual audit reports of the SOEs that report to the unit on its website.
26.
Our efforts will particularly focus on Tajikistan Aluminum Company (Talco) and
Barki Tajik, the two largest SOEs. Talco’s financial accounts for 2006 through 2008 will be
audited by a reputable international audit firm (one of the big four); the audit reports will be
published on the company’s website (benchmark). We will continue with the schedule of
tariff adjustments agreed with the World Bank, in order to achieve cost recovery by end2010, while the government will improve the social mitigation mechanism to ensure that the
15

These SOEs are Talco, Tajik Rail, Tajik Air, Barki Tajik, Tajikgas, Oil Gas and Coal, Vostokredmet,
Tajikcement, Amonatbank, and Tajiktelecom.

55

most vulnerable segments of the population have access to a basic minimum of energy
services. Barki Tajik’s 2007 and 2008 financial audit reports will be published on the
company’s website.
27.
Following last year’s order by the minister of finance requiring disclosure of
beneficial ownership of all companies registered with the ministry’s Agency for Securities,
we will finalize the database of beneficial ownership of all companies listed with the Agency,
and publish it on the ministry’s website.
Agriculture
28.
Based on the work of the government consultant, we will adopt an action plan to
resolve the cotton debt problem, which holds back growth in the agricultural sector
(benchmark). The action plan will include (i) steps to address the problem of farmers’
outstanding debt to investors; (ii) maximum recovery of debt from investors to Kredit Invest,
including by seizing pledged collateral, with a view to minimizing the financial impact on the
NBT which guaranteed most of this debt; (iii) outline of a plan to move to a private-sector led
financing mechanism (considering a similar design as the European Bank For Reconstruction
and Development’s Tajik Agricultural Finance Facility); and (iv) due attention to the social
context. We are working closely with the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank in
this area. A precondition for having a private-sector led financing mechanism will be the
ability to use land-use rights as collateral.
29.
In the meantime, we will implement modifications to the temporary financing scheme
that we introduced in 2008. Starting in 2009, the budget resources made available to
commercial banks for onlending will no longer be restricted to cotton farmers, but will be
available to the whole agricultural sector. Banks will have complete freedom in loan
allocation, and farmers will have complete freedom in their crop choice.
Data
30.
Regarding data issues, we plan to strengthen our national accounts and price statistics,
for which our national statistics agency is requesting IMF technical assistance.
IV. PROGRAM MONITORING
31.
We will monitor progress in implementing the program through quantitative
performance criteria and indicative targets, as well as prior actions, and structural
benchmarks set for June 2009 and December 2009. These are listed in the tables attached to
the letter of intent. The technical memorandum of understanding which is also attached to
this letter defines the quantitative targets of the program and their adjustors, and specifies
reporting requirements. The planned reforms related to the special audit of the NBT will be

56

the main focus for discussion for the first review under the proposed arrangement. In this
regard, the completion of the first review under the PRGF arrangement—which is envisaged
for September 2009—will require observance of the quantitative performance criteria for
end-June 2009, and completion of the second review—which is envisaged for March 2010—
will require observance of the quantitative performance criteria for end-December 2009. The
first review will focus on reforms at the NBT, including the follow-up on the
recommendations from the special audit and steps to strengthen the NBT’s liquidity
management framework, and resolution of cotton debt issues. The second review will
maintain focus on reforms at the NBT and, in addition, concentrate on reforms in the area of
SOEs. At the time of the first review, we will also set additional quantitative performance
criteria and benchmarks for 2010.

57
ATTACHMENT II. TAJIKISTAN: TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
March 31, 2009
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This memorandum defines the quantitative performance criteria and the indicative
targets and relative adjustors, and establishes the content and frequency of the data to be
provided to IMF staff for the program monitoring relating to the program supported under the
Poverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF) under the request in the authorities’ Letter of
Intent dated March 31, 2009.
II. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
A. Definitions and Concepts
2.
Test dates. Quantitative performance criteria are set semi-annually starting June 30,
2009 through December 31, 2011, and are to be met at the end of each period unless
otherwise specified.
3.
National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT). The NBT is the central bank of the country
responsible for the formulation and implementation of monetary policy. For the purpose of
the program, NBT includes all its central and regional offices.
4.
General government. For the purpose of the program, “general government”
includes the republican government, local (including municipal) governments, and all extrabudgetary funds at all levels of general government, including the Agency of Social
Protection and Pensions. It excludes all other agencies not specifically listed, including but
not limited to Barki Tajik and Talco.
5.
Foreign-financed PIP and related grants. The foreign financed PIP is a program of
investments in infrastructure and social sectors agreed by the general government of
Tajikistan and its donors (including but not limited to international financial organizations).
The program is fully financed by related grants and loans, and does not involve any additional
financing commitment from the general government of Tajikistan. Related grants are grants
provided by the donors financing the PIP for financing of projects included in the PIP.
6.
Domestic arrears are defined as the general government expenditure that have not
been paid after coming due as determined in the State Budget of the Republic of Tajikistan
and other government documents regulating the execution of the Budget.

58
7.
External arrears are defined as overdue payments (principal or interest) on external
debt contracted, guaranteed, or converted into interstate debt by the general government of
Tajikistan or the NBT.
8.
Concessional and nonconcessional debt. Concessional debt is defined as debt with a
grant element equivalent of 35 percent or more. The grant element is calculated using the
commercial interest reference rates (CIRRs) plus a margin, which will be taken as those for
December 31, 2008. For debts of an original maturity of 15 years or more, the average CIRR
over the last 10 years will be used, while the average of CIRRs of the preceding six-month
period will be used to assess the concessionality of debts with original maturities of less than
15 years. To the 10-year and 6-month averages of CIRRs, the following margins will be
added: 0.75 percent for repayment periods of less than 15 years; 1 percent for 15–19 years;
1.15 percent for 20–29 years; and 1.25 percent for 30 and more years. In general, the grant
element is calculated as value of the loan minus present discounted value of future payments
over the loan value (multiplied by 100). Present discounted value is sum of all future
discounted payments (both amortization and interest), where the discount rate corresponds to
the CIRR mentioned above. Nonconcessional debt is defined as debt without a grant element
or with a grant element of less than 35 percent. The debt refers also to commitments
contracted or guaranteed and for which value has not been received. The grant element is
calculated using the CIRRs plus a margin, which will be taken as those for [December 31,
2008] until revised in the program. The calculation is performed by the authorities and
verified by the IMF based on the data provided by the authorities.
9.
Valuation changes. For program monitoring, U.S. dollar-denominated components
of the general government’s and the NBT’s balance sheets will be valued at the program
exchange rate (SM 3.452 = $1.00; official exchange rate as of December 31, 2008). Other
foreign currency denominated items will be valued at the respective cross rates between the
program exchange rate of the U.S. dollar and current official exchange rates of the U.S. dollar
against those currencies as of December 31, 2008. The SDR components will be valued at the
program SDR exchange rate SDR 1 = $1.524 (December 31, 2008). Official gold holdings
shall be valued at $865 per troy ounce (December 31, 2008).
B. Quantitative Performance Criteria and Indicative Targets
Quantitative Performance Criterion 1: Ceiling on a cumulative flow of net domestic
assets of the NBT for the year.
10.
Definition. For the purpose of the program, net domestic assets (NDA) of the NBT
are defined as reserve money minus net foreign assets of the NBT. The cumulative flow of
NDA for the year is defined as a difference between end-of-period balances for a period
under evaluation and the preceding end-of-the year balance, unless otherwise specified.
Reserve money (RM) is composed of currency in circulation (CC), required reserves (RR),

59
other bank reserves (OBR), and deposits of nongovernmental nonbanks with the NBT
(DNGNB). The value of the net foreign assets of the NBT is calculated as the difference
between NBT’s claims on nonresidents and its liabilities to nonresidents. The NBT’s NDA
comprise the following assets and liabilities: net credit to the general government, net claims
on banks, credit to the economy, and other items net (OIN). OIN includes the foreign
exchange revaluation and capital accounts of the NBT.
11.
Adjustor for changes in reserve requirement ratio. The ceiling on a cumulative
flow of NDA of the NBT for the year will be adjusted upwards (downward) when the
required reserve rates (rr) on deposits in local and/or foreign currency (DB) are increased
(decreased), resulting in a corresponding increase (decrease) of reserve money (RM).
NDA before RR change: NDA=RM-NFA
RM=CC+RR+OBR+DNGNB where:
RR=rr*DB
DB – deposit base
rr – required reserve rate
Define: drr – change of required reserve rate.
DB – deposit base used for calculation of required reserves
drr*DB – amount of upward (if drr>0) or downward (if drr<0) adjustment in RM
NDA after RR change NDA=RM (+/-)drrDB-NFA.
12.
Adjustor for settlement of external guarantees different from projections. The
ceiling on change in net domestic assets of the NBT will be adjusted by the difference of the
actual settlement of external guarantees from the projected settlement of external guarantees
under the program. The external guarantees extended by the NBT are the guarantees provided
in favor of foreign financial and nonfinancial institutions to secure credit lines for Kredit
Invest, cotton investors, and their suppliers. When the NBT settles a guarantee on behalf of
these parties, the NBT books a domestic claim on these parties.
Quantitative Performance Criterion 2: Floor on a cumulative flow for the year of total
net international reserves (in millions of U.S. dollars).
13.
Definition. Total net international reserves of the NBT are defined as the difference
between total gross international reserves of the NBT and total reserve liabilities of the NBT.
Total gross international reserves of the NBT are defined to include NBT’s holdings of

60
monetary gold, SDRs, convertible currencies in cash or in nonresident financial institutions
that are readily available and any reserve position at the IMF. Also included are holdings of
foreign currency-denominated securities issued by governments or central banks of OECD
member states. Excluded are changes in the level of gross foreign reserves that arise from
revaluation of gold, capital subscriptions in foreign financial institutions, nonliquid assets of
the NBT, convertible currency denominated claims on domestic banks and other residents,
assets in nonconvertible currencies, foreign assets pledged as collateral or otherwise
encumbered and the net forward position, if any (defined as the difference between the face
value of foreign currency denominated NBT off balance sheet claims on nonresidents and
foreign currency obligations to both residents and nonresidents). Reserve liabilities of the
NBT are defined as liabilities outstanding to the IMF and liabilities of the NBT to
nonresidents with an original maturity of up to and including one year. A cumulative flow for
the year of total net international reserves (in millions of U.S. dollars) is defined as a
difference between the end-of-period balances for the period under evaluation and the
preceding end-of-the year balance, unless otherwise specified.
14.
Adjustor for settlement of external guarantees different from projections. The
floor under net international reserves will be adjusted by the negative difference of the actual
settlement of external guarantees from the projected settlement of external guarantees under
the program. The external guarantees extended by the NBT are the guarantees provided in
favor of foreign financial and nonfinancial institutions to secure credit lines for Kredit Invest,
cotton investors, and their suppliers.
Quantitative Performance Criterion 3: Zero ceiling on new lending and guarantees
from the NBT to private sector (continuous quantitative performance criterion).
15.
Definition. New lending from the NBT to the private sector is defined as loans
extended by the NBT to domestic commercial banks, credit unions, credit associations, and
microfinance organizations with a maturity of more than three months, and loans extended by
the NBT to other domestic nonbank financial institutions or any other domestic entity other
than the general government. Short-term liquidity loans to domestic commercial banks, credit
unions, credit associations, and microfinance organizations with a maturity of up to three
months are not included under this definition. Guarantees are defined as any guarantee
extended by the NBT of principal or debt service payment for debt issued or contracted by
private sector entities.
16.
Adjustor for settlement of external guarantees different from projections. The
ceiling on new lending from the NBT to the private sector will be adjusted by the difference
of the actual settlement of outstanding existing external guarantees from the projected
settlement of external guarantees under the program. The external guarantees extended by the
NBT were the guarantees provided in favor of foreign financial and nonfinancial institutions
to secure credit lines for Kredit Invest, cotton investors, and their suppliers. When the NBT

61
settles a guarantee on behalf of these parties, the NBT books a domestic claim on these
parties.
Quantitative Performance Criterion 4: Floor on the cumulative overall fiscal balance of
the general government excluding foreign-financed PIP and related grants.
17.
Definition. The overall fiscal balance of the general government is defined from
below the line on a cash basis as the negative sum of:
•

change in net claims on the general government of the NBT: net claims on the
general government of the NBT is defined as the sum of the change in stocks
of the NBT’s net claims on the general government, which include all deposits
of the general government with the NBT, counterpart deposits (which reflect
balance of payment and/or general budget support from international financial
institutions and other donors), NBT loans and advances to the general
government, NBT holdings of government securities, bank restructuring costs,
and the privatization account (where proceeds from the privatization of state
property are held);

•

the change in net claims on the general government of the rest of the domestic
banking system: net claims on the general government of the rest of the
domestic banking system are defined to include the net position of the general
government with respect to other domestic commercial bank assets (loans,
overdrafts, cash advances, holdings of treasury bills or other securities) and
liabilities (deposits, etc.).

•

the change in net claims on the general government of domestic nonbank
institutions and households: net claims on the general government of domestic
nonbank institutions and households are defined as treasury bills, bonds or
other government securities held by nonbank institutions and households
(including nonresidents and nonresident financial institutions), plus any other
liabilities of the general government to domestic nonbank institutions or
households.

•

the change in net foreign liabilities of the general government: net foreign
liabilities of the general government are defined as government debt to foreign
sovereigns, and foreign financial and nonfinancial institutions. For this
purpose, net foreign liabilities exclude liabilities that arose in the context of
the externally financed PIP.

•

gross proceeds from the privatization of state property: gross proceeds from
the privatization of state property are defined as all receipts originating from
the sale of the general government property.

62
•

the change in gross arrears of the general government: gross arrears refer to
domestic or external arrears.

All changes will be calculated as the difference between end-of-period stocks, net of any
valuation changes resulting from currency movements.
Quantitative Performance Criterion 5: Ceiling on general government wage and
pension arrears (continuous quantitative performance criterion).
18.
Definition. Arrears on general government and pensioners’ pensions are defined as
any shortfall in monthly disbursements of wages and pensions. These payments are defined
as overdue if they have come due at the end of the month and remain unpaid thereafter. To
allow monitoring of the above defined arrears the government will provide data on actual
wage payments as part of the monthly budget execution statements submitted to the IMF
staff. The Agency on Social Protection and Pensions will provide quarterly reports and
statements of their operations.
Quantitative Performance Criterion 6: Ceiling on contracting or guaranteeing of any
nonconcessional external debt (continuous quantitative performance criterion).
19.
Definition. The external debt is defined as in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on
Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt (Decision No. 12274-(00/85), adopted
August 24, 2000; see below) and also includes commitments contracted or guaranteed and for
which value has not been received. The debt limits apply to short-, medium-, and long-term
debt contracted by the government of Tajikistan, the National Bank of Tajikistan, and any
other agency acting on behalf of the government, including but not limited to state-owned
banks.
20.
The definition of debt set forth in point No. 9 of the guidelines reads as follows:
“(a) For the purposes of this guideline, the term ‘debt’ will be understood to mean a current,
i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of
value in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to
make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some
future points in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities
under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as follows:
(a) loans, i.e., advances of money to obligor by the lender made on the basis of an
undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits, bonds,
debentures, commercial loans, and buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that
are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is required to repay the
funds and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future
(such as repurchase agreements and official swap arrangements); (b) suppliers’ credits, i.e.,
contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payments until some time after the

63
date on which the goods are delivered or services are provided; and (c) leases, i.e.,
arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has the right to use one or
more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the total expected service life of
the property, while the lessor retains the title to the property. For the purpose of the guideline,
the debt is the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to
be made during the period of the agreement excluding those payments that cover the
operation, repair or maintenance of the property. (b) Under the definition of debt set out in
point 9(a) above, arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded damages arising from the failure
to make payment under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make
payment on an obligation that is not considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on
delivery) will not give rise to debt.”
21.
External debt limits apply to the contracting or guaranteeing of new nonconcessional
short-term external debt (with an original maturity of up to and including one year), and to
the contracting or guaranteeing of new nonconcessional medium- and long-term external debt
(with original maturities of more than one year).
22.
Exclusions from the external debt limits. Loans contracted for debt rescheduling or
refinancing if the terms of the new loan are more favorable will be excluded from the debt
limits. IMF credit is excluded from the external debt limits. The rollover of the existing
guarantees will be excluded from the debt limits. If pledged reserves of the NBT were to be
securitized, these amounts will also be excluded from the debt limits. The performance
criterion on new nonconcessional short-term external debt will not apply to loans classified
as international reserve liabilities of the NBT (liabilities of the NBT to nonresidents with an
original maturity of up to and including one year). Normal import-related financing is
excluded from the criterion.
23.
Valuation of debt denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Debts
falling within the external debt limits that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S.
dollar shall be valued in U.S. dollars at the exchange rate prevailing at the time the
contracting or guaranteeing takes place or at the exchange rate stipulated in the contract.
24.
Guarantee of a debt. For the purposes of the program, the guarantee of a debt arises
from any explicit legal obligation of the general government or the NBT or any other agency
acting on behalf of the general government to service such a debt in the event of nonpayment
by the debtor (involving payments in cash or in kind), or indirectly through any other
obligation of the general government or the NBT or any other agency acting on behalf of the
general government to finance a shortfall incurred by the debtors.

64
Quantitative Performance Criterion 7: Ceiling on disbursements of concessional
external financing.
25.
Definition: Disbursements of concessional external financing are defined as
disbursements of debt with a grant element equivalent of 35 percent or more.
Quantitative Performance Criterion 8. New external payments arrears (continuous
quantitative performance criterion).
26.
Definition. External payments arrears are defined as overdue payments (principal or
interest) on external debt contracted, guaranteed, or converted into interstate debt by the
general government of Tajikistan or the NBT.
Indicative Target 1: Floor on tax collections.
27.
Definition. Tax collections are defined to include all taxes (and custom revenues)
collected under the general government budget. Regarding internal taxation, the definition
excludes any proceeds from loans, or other banking system credits, the issuance of securities,
or from the sale of state assets. Custom revenues are defined to include customs duties and
other taxes (including VAT) on international trade and transactions.
Indicative Target 2: Floor on social- and poverty-related expenditure.
28.
Definition. Social- and poverty-related expenditure is defined as the sum of current
and capital expenditures in the education, health, and social protection sectors.

REPUBLIC OF TAJIKISTAN
Debt Sustainability Analysis Under the Debt Sustainability Framework for
Low-Income Countries
Prepared by the Staffs of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank
Approved by David Owen and Dominique Desruelle (IMF) and
Carlos Braga and Luca Barbone (World Bank)
March 31, 2009
Based on the external low-income country (LIC) debt sustainability analysis (DSA),
Tajikistan’s risk of debt distress remains high. 1 Under the baseline scenario, external debt
burden indicators in present value terms remain below their respective thresholds, with the
exception of the debt-to-exports ratio. The high level of concessionality of the external public
and publicly guaranteed debt is a key factor underlying these projections. A decline in GDP
and/or export growth rates, a shortfall in other inflows, or a sharp exchange rate
depreciation relative to the baseline, all have the potential to undermine debt sustainability.
Likewise, additional lending compared to the baseline, even at concessional terms, would
undermine debt sustainability. The public DSA yields similar results in light of the current
size and the projected evolution of the domestic debt stock. It also shows that a one-off
increase in the government’s debt obligations, e.g. related to existing contingent liabilities,
would push the debt-to-GDP ratio just above its respective threshold for the first six years,
but would not put the country on an unsustainable debt path in the long run. In sum, the DSA
suggests that there is little scope for additional borrowing compared to the baseline
projections and underlines the need to carefully scrutinize individual investment projects to
ensure that they will yield the intended growth dividends.
III. BACKGROUND
1.
Over the last 10 years, multilateral donors were the main creditors of Tajikistan.
During 1996–2008, lending by multilaterals increased by almost six times in absolute value
and reached 50 percent of Tajikistan’s external loan portfolio as of end-2008. A debt-forequity swap with Russia significantly reduced Tajikistan’s debt burden.

1

The DSA has been produced jointly by World Bank and IMF staff, in consultation with Asian Development
Bank staff. It updates the last DSA of April 2007 presented in the IMF Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV
Consultation. The fiscal year for Tajikistan is January 1–December 31.

2
2.
Recent developments are marked by increased bilateral borrowing. Disbursement
of loans from China increased the share of bilateral creditors in the last two years. Most of
the increase in debt stock during 2008 was due to disbursement of loans from China
($277 million). At the same time, major multilaterals, the World Bank and Asian
Development Bank, provided all new financing in the form of grants. As a result, the share of
bilateral creditors increased from 35 percent to 47 percent, while multilaterals’ share in
Tajikistan’s debt portfolio decreased from 61 percent to 50 percent at end-2008 (also
reflecting early repayment to the IMF).
3.
Domestic debt constitutes only a negligible part of public debt. This is mostly due
to the fact that the general government budget ran continuous surpluses (excluding externally
financed public investment program) in recent years. Domestic debt represents 3 percent of
total public debt (end-2008) and mostly consists of non-tradable government securities held
by the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT).
4.
The stock of publicly guaranteed debt has further increased. In addition to the
guarantees issued by the NBT for cotton sector financing, the government issued three new
guarantees in 2008: two for credits from the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development and one from the government of France. These credits, with total commitments
of $29 million, are to be used for rehabilitation of water supply in Khujand province, solid
waste management in the city of Dushanbe, and reconstruction of the Dushanbe airport.
5.
New credit agreements of around $80 million were signed in 2008. These included
credit agreements with France, the Islamic Development Bank, KfW, OPEC Fund, and the
Saudi Development Fund, all on concessional terms. The government of Tajikistan has also
signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Eximbank of China to extend a new credit in
the amount of $100 million to finance road and energy projects. The terms of this loan are
still being negotiated, but the authorities have committed to borrowing only on concessional
terms.
6.
The status of debt obligations to Pakistan is now clarified. This debt of
$13 million was restructured in 2003. In May 2004, the Tajik authorities announced a verbal
agreement with the Pakistani authorities, according to which the debt would be converted
into a grant with a subsequent write-off of accumulated interest liabilities. Accordingly, the
Ministry of Finance of Tajikistan removed the credit from debt register and discontinued its
service. However, in 2008 the ministry of finance (MOF) reported the receipt of notification
from the government of Pakistan, which requested debt service. Upon clarification from the
government of Pakistan, the government of Tajikistan has allocated adequate funds in the
2009 budget for debt service according to the initial restructuring agreement.

3
IV. UNDERLYING DSA ASSUMPTIONS
7.
The impact of the global economic slowdown clouds the economic outlook for
Tajikistan over the coming two years consistent with current WEO projections.
Thereafter, staff projects that Tajikistan would return to a high growth path under the baseline
scenario:
•

•

•

•

Tajikistan’s underlying growth potential is in the range of 5–7 percent per annum, as
suggested by past performance. However, on account of adverse external environment
(slowdown of remittances, declining world market prices for tradables, etc.) growth is
expected to be subdued in 2009–11.
The 2009–14 projections are based on a substantial depreciation of the real effective
exchange rate, which should return the current account balance towards its equilibrium
level of about 3 percent from around 9 percent in 2008.
Compared to past performance, medium- and long-term projections are based on
conservative assumptions about non-debt creating flows such as foreign direct
investment, remittances and official transfers (Table 1a).
Underlying assumption for the fiscal projections is that the government budget deficit
(excluding Public Investment Program) will stay at about ½ percent of GDP. This seems
feasible based on current spending plans and revenue projections.

4
Box 1. Tajikistan: Macroeconomic Assumptions
Real GDP growth is projected at 2 percent in 2009, with gradual recovery in 2010 and 2011 (3 and
5 percent, respectively) and in the range of 6 to 7 percent during 2012–14 (when large infrastructure
projects are completed) with some slowdown throughout 2028 (to 5 percent). These figures are
significantly below their 10-year historical average of 8 percent (1998–2008). The GDP deflator is
expected to decline from a projected 19 percent (2009) to 6 percent by 2015—reflecting progress
toward a low-inflation environment—and remain at the level of 6 percent through 2028.
Export of goods and services is expected to decline due to a deteriorating external environment. A
return to the previous growth path is expected in 2010, reflecting expansion in nontraditional
agriculture sectors and a rebounding external demand. An average growth rate of about 9 percent is
projected for 2010–28 as the economy is expected to expand following investment in the energy
sector and progress with structural reforms.
Current account is expected to deteriorate in 2009, largely reflecting a decline in remittances and
exports. Starting 2010 and onward, the current account should improve, following a depreciation of the
REER and a recovery in remittances, although the role of the latter is expected to diminish gradually.
The reserve coverage of imports is projected to build up gradually to about five months by 2028.
Fiscal policy is assumed to aim for an overall balance (excluding the externally financed public
investment program) over the medium term, after a modest deficit in 2009–11 on account of the
growth slowdown.
External assistance and scaling up. Official external loan financing on concessional terms is
estimated to reach its peak in 2009 (6.6 percent of GDP) and then decline to 3.5 percent by 2015 and
gradually decline to 2.6 percent of GDP throughout 2028. After 2012, the DSA assumes that no new
grants will be disbursed during the projected period.
Public domestic debt. It is assumed that the share of domestic public debt in total public debt will
stay at the current level.
Real interest rates. For domestic debt, it is expected that real interest rate becomes positive starting
2013 and then averages 8 percent per annum for the remainder of the projection period.

8.
The baseline scenario shows that Tajikistan remains at a high risk of debt
distress. According to the latest three-year average of the World Bank’s CPIA rating
(2006-08), Tajikistan’s policies and institutions are assessed as those corresponding to a
“poor performer.” 2 The table below provides the debt-burden thresholds for countries in this
category.

2

Three-year average of CPIA ratings is used according to recently issued joint Bank-Fund Staff Guidance Note
on the Application of the joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Framework (October 2008). These guidelines aim
at a less volatile assessment of risk than that based on a single latest CPIA rating.

V. EXTERNAL DSA
A. Baseline
9.
Under the baseline scenario, only one of Tajikistan’s external debt burden
indicators, the PV of debt-to-exports ratio, is projected to breach policy-dependent
thresholds (Figure 1 and Table 1a). In particular, by 2009, the debt-to-exports ratio will
reach 141 percent, exceeding the threshold of 100 percent by a significant margin. This
indicator is expected to deteriorate continuously throughout 2014; after that, it is projected to
decrease gradually throughout 2028, however, continuously staying above the threshold.
10.
External debt service ratios are expected to stay below their thresholds over the
entire period. During the projected period, debt service payments continue to be
manageable, with the assumption that all of Tajikistan’s external public and publicly
guaranteed debt is contracted on concessional terms, albeit spiking during the years when
principal payments on loans from China fall due.
B. Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
11.
The historical scenario is based on averages from 1999 to 2007, 3 and thus
reflects a period of macroeconomic consolidation, some progress with structural
reforms, and debt reduction. During 1999–2006, the current account deficit was relatively
small—at below 3 percent of GDP, though it significantly increased during 2007–08 due to
high import prices and increasing imports associated with implementation of large
infrastructure projects. Therefore, under this scenario, all debt burden ratios—excluding the
PV of debt-to-exports ratio—remain well below their threshold; these ratios also follow a
downward trend throughout the projection period. The scenario illustrates the importance of
3

For exports and non-interest current account only 2005-2007 historical averages were used due to a break in
the export series which reflects a change in the treatment of exports of aluminum in the current account. For the
rest of the variables, the usual 10-year historical average was applied.

6
preserving macroeconomic stability, progress with structural reforms and continued prudent
debt management. This will be even more important in the period ahead, when external
conditions may be less favorable.
12.
A scenario with increased bilateral borrowing reflects an additional 1 percent
of GDP of bilateral borrowing per annum to finance higher capital spending. This
scenario shows a deterioration of all indicators compared to the baseline scenario. In
particular, the PV of debt-to-exports and the PV of debt-to-GDP ratios breach relative
policy thresholds. Under this scenario, the PV of debt-to-exports is expected to deteriorate
continuously and peak at 327 percent in 2028. Similarly, the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio will
deteriorate continuously breaching the threshold in 2018 and peaking at 39 percent in 2028.
Remaining indicators are also expected to deteriorate (against baseline) but remain under
their respective policy thresholds.
13.
A high-investment low-growth scenario underscores the risk to debt
sustainability if investment does not yield the expected strong growth (Table 1b). The
scenario demonstrates that, starting in 2013, when growth is reduced by half due to lower
than expected productivity of investments, all ratios deteriorate notably, with the ratio of the
PV of debt-to-GDP approaching its respective threshold by the end of projection period.
The ratio of the PV of debt-to-exports deteriorates even further.
14.
A relaxation of the authorities’ current prudent approach to contracting
external debt only on concessional terms would lead to a deterioration of Tajikistan’s
external debt indicators compared to the baseline scenario. If all new borrowing were to
be contracted on less than concessional terms during the projection period, Tajikistan’s PV
of debt-to-export ratio would rise substantially. Specifically, with the increase in the average
interest rate on new disbursements by 2 percentage points, the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio
would rise continuously and breach the threshold in 2025, and the PV of debt-to-exports
ratio would increase from existing level and stay above the threshold.
15.
Bound tests show that adverse macroeconomic shocks would also have a
profound negative impact on Tajikistan’s external position. In the event of a combined
shock (to real GDP growth, exports growth, FDI inflows), all ratios, except debt service-torevenues, exceed the policy-dependent thresholds by a significant margin and almost all of
them remain above the thresholds throughout the projection period.
VI. PUBLIC DSA
16.
The results of the public sector DSA are very similar to those of the external
DSA, given that public sector domestic debt is small. An important stress test in the
public sector DSA models the impact of the government facing a contingent liability equal
to 10 percent of GDP. This amount broadly corresponds to the expected possible

7
recapitalization needs of the central bank and the fiscal costs of resolving the cotton debt
problem (estimated at around $500 million). In this scenario, the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio
will breach the threshold and stay above it during the six years following the assumption of
such liabilities.
VII. DEBT DISTRESS CLASSIFICATION AND CONCLUSIONS
17.
Tajikistan’s risk of debt distress remains high, although its resilience to
adverse shocks has improved compared to the findings of the 2007 DSA. The results of
the alternative scenarios and stress tests indicate that the debt sustainability situation could
further deteriorate with adverse macroeconomic shocks, borrowing on nonconcessional
terms or incurring additional debt—even on concessional terms—and could become
unsustainable if growth associated with high investment does not materialize. The DSA
results thus underscore the need for the authorities to exercise extreme caution in incurring
new debt and to carefully vet large-scale investment projects, to make sure that external
resources are used productively. Sound macroeconomic policies and acceleration of
structural reforms would also be essential for maintaining debt sustainability by
strengthening Tajikistan’s growth potential and safeguarding external stability.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Rate of change for exports in 2005 reflects the structural break in exports series due to a change in the treatment of aluminium exports in the BOP.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Source: Staff projections and simulations.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Safeguards Assessment

The last safeguards assessment of the NBT was completed on July 23, 2003; it proposed
specific measures to address a number of confirmed weaknesses in the NBT's safeguards
framework, as reported in IMF Country Report No. 03/222. In 2007, the NBT authorities
informed the Fund that misreporting had occurred, subsequent to which an international audit
firm was engaged to complete a special audit of the relevant data and the NBT's financing
activities related to the cotton sector. An update safeguards assessment of the NBT in the
context of a new PRGF-supported arrangement would be conducted only when: (i) the
special audit has been finalized and its conclusions published on the NBT website, and (ii)
the annual external audit of the financial year ending April 30, 2009 has been substantially
completed by an international audit firm with central banking auditing experience. The
appointment of such an audit firm is a prior action for the Board's consideration of a new
PRGF arrangement.
X.

Exchange Rate Arrangements

The NBT has maintained a conventional peg exchange rate arrangement, but has committed
to a flexible exchange rate regime (managed float) going forward. Since August 2005, the
NBT has increased the frequency of calculating and announcing the official exchange rate
from a weekly to a daily basis. The official exchange rate is based on all interbank
transactions in foreign exchange.
With effect from December 9, 2004, the Republic of Tajikistan accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement. As a result, the Republic of
Tajikistan maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions, except for exchange restrictions
maintained for security reasons that have been notified to the Fund pursuant to Executive
Board decision No. 144-(52/51).

ANNEX II. TAJIKISTAN: STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of March 10, 2009
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
1.
General: Data provision has some shortcomings (mainly in the areas of national
accounts, price statistics, and monetary statistics), but is broadly adequate for surveillance
2.
National Accounts and Price Statistics: There are significant deficiencies in the
statistical techniques for national accounts and price statistics, most notably in procedures to
estimate the informal economy, and the techniques for imputation, replacement, quality
adjustment, and introduction of new products in the price indices. Technical assistance from
the World Bank and the Fund have yielded some improvements, but there are remaining
problems with the CPI compilation methodology and the GDP volume estimates, relating in
parts to the period-to-period averages of price indices.
3.
Government finance statistics: Government finance statistics (GFS) are based on
cash transactions as recommended in the 1986 Manual on Government Finance Statistics.
There are no plans to migrate the basis of compilation to the 2001 Government Finance
Statistics Manual. There are occasional budget classification issues within the economic
classification of expenditures and the classification of above- and below-the-line transactions,
which are being resolved with the help of a regional advisor.
4.
Monetary and financial statistics: In late 2007, a serious misreporting episode
concerning the monetary accounts was uncovered. The special audit of the National Bank of
Tajikistan that was completed in March 2009 found that there was no “reliable accounting
baseline.” The authorities have committed to establishing such an accounting baseline,
including through an audit of net international reserves as of end-2008 and the regular audit
of the NBT’s financial statements for fiscal year 2009 (ends April).
5.
Balance of payments: There is a need for consistency in applying the residency
concept in the balance of payments and the national accounts, and the scope of the foreign
trade data needs to be improved to cover the shuttle trade.
Data Standards and Quality
6.
Tajikistan began participating in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) on
November 17, 2004. Metadata updated regularly. The authorities have indicated their interest
in graduating from the GDDS to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS).
They have appointed a national SDDS coordinator and requested technical assistance for this
purpose.

ANNEX III. TAJIKISTAN: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of March 3, 2009)
Country Director: Mr. Motoo Konishi
Country Economist: Mr. Sudharshan Canagarajah

Telephone: (202) 473 4278
Telephone: (202) 473 4458

A. Partnership in Tajikistan’s Development Strategy
1.
The Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy, endorsed by the Bank’s Board of Executive
Directors on July 26, 2005, and updated on June 22 , 2007, focuses on the following three
priorities, which are in line with the country’s Second Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS 2)
for 2007–2009:
•

To improve business opportunities in rural and urban areas.

•

To enhance and preserve the quality of the human capital.

•

To improve energy service delivery and increase electricity exports.

2.
In addition, in each of the above areas, the Bank Group and government have agreed
to work to improve government capacity for service delivery, and to reduce corruption by
giving special emphasis to measures that increase transparency of resource use, reduce
discretionary controls in business operations, and encourage the participation of users in the
provision of services.
3.
Macroeconomic management is aimed at establishing a stable economic environment
through appropriate fiscal, monetary, exchange rate, and sustainable debt policies. However,
macroeconomic management started worsening around October 2007 and the risk of debt
distress has emerged. Tajikistan’s long term prospects remain positive only if the authorities move
quickly to restore sound macroeconomic management and implement institutional reforms to improve
the business climate, the financial sector, the agricultural sector, transparency and governance of large
state-owned enterprises, and public financial management. Expansion in aluminum processing
capacity to service continued high world demand, recovery in cotton production following institutional
reforms, buoyant inflows of remittances, and the start of a large-scale Russian–financed hydroelectric
power project and other infrastructure investments have the potential to support growth of 7–8 percent
over the long term.

4.
The IMF has taken the lead in assisting Tajikistan in enhancing macroeconomic
stability. The Fund has encouraged the authorities to continue with fiscal consolidation,
maintain a restrictive monetary policy, and conduct prudent debt management policy to
enhance its sustainability.
5.
The World Bank has taken the lead in the policy dialogue on structural issues,
including poverty reduction measures, agriculture sector reforms, private sector development,
institution building, budget planning, improving public service delivery, and governance. A
range of instruments is used to conduct the dialogue. Policy based lending and technical
assistance are supporting reforms in a number of sectors. The Programmatic Development

9
Policy Grant (PDPG) operation of three annual development policy financing programs to
support government’s medium-term reform program was approved in July 19, 2007. The
program s supporting the government in the areas of public administration reform, public
expenditure management, social service delivery, and private sector development.
6.
This broad-based approach is combined with investment projects and technical
assistance in health, education, municipal infrastructure, energy, agriculture and rural
development, environment, public financial management and public administration. Over the
last three years the Bank in collaboration with others has produced analytical work aimed at
informing program design. A country procurement assessment report, a country financial
accountability assessment, a public and civil service wage note and an update, and a
remittances note have informed the public sector reform program. A trade diagnostic, an
investment climate assessment, an aviation sector note, an energy utility reform review, the
Central Asia Regional Electricity Export Potential Study, and an Agricultural Development
Strategy have highlighted key reforms required to attract private sector investment. A poverty
assessment update has deepened understanding of poverty and its dynamics, and is important
for the design of policy reforms that effectively reduce poverty. Poverty and social impact
assessments of cotton and energy reforms have helped promote dialogue with the government
on issues of social protection. A programmatic public expenditure review is supporting
Tajikistan’s first public expenditure and financial accountability review, and analyzing the
country’s prospects for achieving the MDGs and long-term growth, and providing support for
the introduction of the MTEF. Two public expenditure tracking surveys, one for health and
one for education, are expected to promote transparency and efficiency of expenditure in
these sectors. A country environmental analysis has identified policy and capacity reforms to
improve environmental management.

B. World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
Areas in which the World Bank leads and there is little direct IMF involvement
7.
Areas in which the Bank leads and there is no direct IMF involvement include the
social sectors, infrastructure, and environmental management. In the social sphere, the Bank
has carried out regular poverty assessments to monitor poverty and develop programs to
alleviate poverty. It has prepared a poverty assessment update has been prepared on the basis
of the 2003 living standards survey. Under the Strengthening National Statistics System
Project, data collection of a new living standards survey was completed in 2007; analysis of
the results is underway.
8.
In education, the Bank is providing policy advice and investment resources. The
ongoing Education Modernization Project (FY03) aims to upgrade the basic education system
by supporting reforms in education financing and management, curriculum and textbooks
development; teacher training and student assessment improvement, and upgrading school
facilities. Tajikistan has also received grant funding from the Education for All Fast Track
Initiative catalytic fund, administered by the Bank. Key issues in education, apart from
infrastructure rehabilitation and capacity building, are pay reform, per capita financing and
expenditure tracking. Assistance to this sector will continue through the PDPG, a multidonor education investment program, and the PSRP. The Bank is also helping with wage
reform in education and a gradual move towards program-based budgeting in the sector
through the PDPG. Jointly with the UNICEF the Bank assists the government in the overall
national education strategy formulation. The IMF has in the past supported the education
reform process, in close collaboration with the World Bank, through a PRGF structural
benchmark requiring the drawing up of a fully costed education reform plan by the
government.
9.
In health, the Bank is helping the government to improve the effectiveness and
efficiency of delivery—both of which are aimed at ensuring the poor access to a basic level of

12
services. Through the Community and Basic Health Project and the PDPG, the Bank is
helping to strengthen the institutional capability (both at the center and district levels) to carry
out health care reforms, to improve the system for budgeting and spending for basic health
services, and pay reform. It is also supporting programs to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS,
malaria, and other communicable diseases. The Avian Fluenza Control and Human Pandemic
Preparedness and Response is minimizing the threat of highly pathogenic avian influenza
infection and other zoonoses posed to humans and poultry; and preparing for control and
respond to influenza pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies in humans.
10.
With regard to infrastructure development, the Bank is concentrating on upgrading
basic utility services for the population as a whole and especially the poor. The Dushanbe
Water Supply Project is helping the Dushanbe municipality and the local water company to
address the most critical deficiencies of water supply services. The Pamir Private Power
Project is supporting improvements in reliability of electricity supply in the Gorno Badakshan
region with participation of the private sector. The Energy Loss Reduction Project is helping
to reduce commercial losses and improve the financial viability of the power and gas sectors.
The Bank has also been leading policy dialogue (under PDPG) on increasing
efficiency/viability to ensure long-term growth prospects of the energy sector. The Municipal
Infrastructure Project is providing support to improve urban infrastructure in big towns.
11.
In agriculture, the Bank is concentrating on land reform, rehabilitation of irrigation
and drainage infrastructure, and introduction of market rules in procurement of inputs and
marketing of outputs as well as on the resolution of the cotton farm debts. The Land
Registration and Cadastre Project is assisting the government with the land reform, issuance
of land certificates, and establishment of a modern cadastre system. The Ferghana Valley
Project aims to increase water supply and efficiency of irrigation systems in the Ferghana
Valley, and develop institutional capacity in land and water resources management. The
Cotton Sector Recovery Project is helping to improve the livelihoods of cotton farmers and to
create conditions for sustainable growth of cotton production in selected, low-income areas.
The project is doing this through assistance for cotton debt resolution, for an improved policy
environment, and for increased cotton output and profitability. Cross cutting policy issues for
increasing productivity in cotton sectors are being addressed through the PDPG.
12.
The Bank has supported programs to improve environmental management and to
deal with natural disasters. A National Environment Action Plan was developed with the
Bank’s help. A 2008 Country Environmental Analysis has highlighted the country’s most
severe environmental issues and proposed measures to strengthen the legal and institutional
framework for addressing them. The Emergency Flood Assistance and Lake Sarez Risk
Mitigation Projects have helped the government to mitigate the consequences of natural
disasters and to build national capacity to address frequent natural hazards such as mudslides,
rock-falls, avalanches, and seasonal floods.
13.
The Bank also supported the government in coping with emergency situations. The
Energy Emergency Project assisted the government in implementing an Energy Emergency
Mitigation Action Plan (EEMAP) to address the energy crisis in 2008 due to the harshest
winter in 25 years. Through the Global Food Price Crisis Response Trust Fund, the Emergency

13

14.
Areas in which the World Bank leads and its analysis serves as input into the IMF
program
15.
The Bank leads the dialogue on structural reforms through the three-year PDPG
program currently under implementation. Institution building and technical assistance in
support of PDPG structural reforms come from several sources, including the PSRP, the
Education Modernization Project, Fast Track Initiative Grant and the Community and Basic
Health Project.
16.
The Bank and the Fund both support private sector development, including in the
areas of financial transparency and improvements in the regulatory framework. The Bank has
completed the Investment Climate Assessment and agriculture sector review to determine the
most important impediments to private sector development. Tajikistan has participated in
three Doing Business surveys and in three Business Environment and Enterprise Performance
surveys since the mid-2000s. These provides insight into trends within Tajikistan to improve
the business environment and show how Tajikistan is performing relative to other countries
of the region. The Bank has supported the preparation of the government’s private sector
development strategy, which is now under implementation with support of an IDF grant.
17.
The Bank and the Fund support enterprise and farm privatization, including
acceleration of privatization of medium and large enterprises, improvements to the corporate
governance framework for public enterprises, land reform, and restructuring of the cotton
subsector. The Bank has completed the Investment Climate Assessment and agriculture
sector review to identify obstacles to growth of agricultural productivity. With support of
donors, the Bank has been providing technical support to the State Committee for
Investments and State Property Management to implement a long-term strategic privatization
plan and to promote private sector investment.
18.
Regulatory reforms include (a) changing role of anti-monopoly agency and further
strengthening its capacity, (b) improving the inspection regime for businesses; and (c)
streamlining licensing. In addition, under the PDPG, the Bank is assisting with separating in
aviation the functions of policymaking, technical regulation, and accident investigation, with
the aim of increasing the transparency and performance of operations. It is also helping with
the restructuring the Tajik Air Company aimed at creating separate entities to operate the
airport, airline, and air traffic control system. This restructuring is expected to increase the
competitiveness of Tajikistan’s aviation sector, with benefits for economic growth and poverty
reduction.

19.
While the Bank has taken the lead in privatization and in structural reforms in the
private sector, the IMF has also a strong interest in these areas, since many of these reforms
are critical to achieving macroeconomic stabilization and enhancing growth. Accordingly, the
two institutions maintain an active dialogue with each other on these matters to ensure good
coordination of interventions.

14
Areas of shared responsibility
20.
The Bank and the Fund are working jointly in the following four main areas
(supported by the Bank’s PDPG, grants, and several investment operations, and the Fund’s
SMP):
•

Public sector management. The Bank has provided technical support to the
government to develop a comprehensive public administration reform strategy. It
includes policy actions in public administration reforms aimed at redefining the role
of the state in line with the market economy needs, reorganizing key ministries,
strengthening the internal control and audit function, and supporting the pay reform.
The Bank is involved in civil service reform while the Fund is providing technical
assistance in support of tax and customs administration and treasury management.

•

Budget planning and execution. Both institutions work on providing support for a
treasury, adoption of new law on public finances introducing modern budgetary
procedures and improved fiscal management, and switching from norm-based costing
and allocation of expenditures to per capita based financing in education and health
sectors. The Bank will continue to provide technical support and mobilize donor
funds to implement the medium-term budget framework. The Bank will also continue
to support public financial external and internal control reform through the PDPG,
IDF grants, and the PSRP. The forthcoming Public Financial Management Project
(FY09) will support treasury reform.

•

Financial sector reforms. This area includes the acceleration of financial sector
restructuring and closure of weak banks, a new regulatory framework for the
establishment of non-bank intermediaries, and significant changes in the tax code
making tax authorities’ access to bank accounts conditional on a court authorization.
In terms of banking supervision, the IMF is monitoring the closure and merger of
banks that do not satisfy prudential requirements. A Financial Sector Assessment
Program (the country’s first), carried out jointly by the Bank and the Fund, was
discussed with the authorities in late 2007. The Bank is implementing a grant from
the FIRST trust fund to support implementation of the assessment’s
recommendations, especially needed reforms at the NBT.

•

Utilities reform. The Fund included in its former PRGF benchmarks related to
energy tariff rates, energy arrears, and collection rates with the aim to reduce quasifiscal activities and increase transparency. The Bank under the PDPG is supporting
tariff reform aimed at reducing the quasi-fiscal deficit. It also supported the
conducting of an audit of Barki Tajik’s accounts, which was completed in August
2008. The Bank is providing financial assistance to help the government to repair the
electricity and gas transmission system, to import the energy needed to meet periodic
winter shortfalls, and to help implement the Energy Emergency Action Mitigation
Plan. The Bank-supported Energy Loss Reduction Project is supporting
implementation of reforms. The Bank is working closely together with the Asian
Development Bank and the EBRD on utilities reform and restructuring of strategic
enterprises such as the railways and airlines.

15
•

Debt sustainability analysis: The Bank and the IMF have started carrying out joint
debt sustainability analyses (DSA). The first one was done in early 2006 and an
update was completed in February 2007. The next joint DSA update will be finalized
before February 2009.

Areas in which the IMF leads and its analysis serves as input into the World Bank
program
21.
The Fund leads the dialogue on fiscal matters, setting the overall envelope for public
expenditures. The Bank’s work in key sectors, such as health, education and infrastructure,
necessitates close cooperation.
22.
In the budgetary area, the Fund is taking the lead on tax reforms and budget
preparation and execution. The IMF also leads the dialogue on polices to rationalize and
contain expenditures in the public sector. These include policies regarding wage setting in
both the public service, and defining the ceiling for public investment expenditures. In these
areas, the Bank takes into account the policy recommendations of the IMF and ensures that
its own policy advice is consistent.
Areas in which the IMF leads and there is no direct World Bank involvement
23.
The Fund takes the lead in the formulation and execution of fiscal and monetary
policies, tax policy, external trade policies, and issues involving economic and financial
statistics. The Bank-financed Strengthening National Statistics System Project is improving
Tajikistan’s capacity to collect, analyze, and disseminate key information required for
evidence-based decision-making.
C. IDA Funding
24.
IDA funding to Tajikistan was provided in the form of 100 percent grant in FY06 and
FY08; while in FY07 allocation was set with a 45 percent grant component. Tajikistan’s
eligibility for grants is determined based on the annual debt sustainability analyses. The
indicative IDA 15 envelope for FY08–10 is about SDR61.0 million. Of this, about
SDR 19.5 million is scheduled for the FY09, about SDR 20.5 million is planned for FY10,
around SDR 21.0 million is targeted for FY11. FY09 IDA allocation will be 100 percent
grant.

ANNEX IV. TAJIKISTAN: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of February 2009)
Country Director: Mr. Makoto Ojiro—Telephone: 992-372-210558/271895/ 271897
1.
Tajikistan became a member of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 1998. The
ADB has participated in the Consultative Group Meeting for Tajikistan since 1998. After
conducting an initial mission in June 1998, ADB completed an Economic Report and Interim
Operational Strategy that identified three areas: (a) agriculture; (b) infrastructure
rehabilitation (especially energy and transport sectors); and (c) social sector, in which ADB
assistance would have the greatest development impact. Based on the Interim Strategy,
ADB’s Board of Directors approved in October 1998 Tajikistan’s country classification,
which provides the basis for Tajikistan’s full access to concessional resources (Asian
Development Fund (ADF)). Under the new ADF grants framework, starting from 2008,
Tajikistan is eligible for 100% grants of its entire ADF allocation up to 2012, subject to a
20% volume discount. Under the performance-based allocation of ADF for 2009-2010,
Tajikistan was allocated $102 million for the two-year period. As of end 2008, Tajikistan has
received $372.50 million in loans, $33.65 million in technical assistance, and $97.27 million
in grants.
2.
In view of Tajikistan’s urgent need for assistance in 1998, in coordination with the
IMF and the World Bank (WB), the ADB provided a Postconflict Infrastructure Program
Loan ($20 million), which was designed to create a framework for developing market-based
transport and energy sectors. The loan was for two years and was fully disbursed by end2000. Based on the satisfactory progress of the Postconflict Infrastructure Program loan
conditionality, the following loans were approved in these two sectors:
3.
Transport Sector: the Road Rehabilitation Project loan ($20 million in 2000), which
rehabilitated the most deteriorated sections of the Dushanbe—Kulyab road in the southern
part of Tajikistan, the most civil-war affected areas; Dushanbe—Kyrgyz Border Road
Rehabilitation Project loans (first phase of $15 million in 2003 and second phase of
$30 million in 2005); and the Regional Road Corridor Improvement Project ($53.4 million
loan/grant in 2007), which improve Tajikistan’s transportation link toward north and east
through Kyrgyz Republic, further to Kazakhstan and Russia, as well as to the People’s
Republic of China. These projects also improve rural roads in the project areas. Continued
supports in strengthening the government’s institutional capacity for efficient management of
national road network are provided under technical assistance grants associated with these
loans and on stand-alone basis. In October 2007, ADB approved a $2.0 million Japan Fund
for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) grant to reconstruct key infrastructure in northeast Tajikistan to
restore access to rural communities that were isolated after flooding in 2006 washed away a
suspension bridge.

17
4.
Power Sector: the Power Rehabilitation Project loan ($34 million in 2000) aims to
improve people’s quality of life and support poverty reduction by increasing the availability
of electricity, and assist in post-conflict recovery of Tajikistan’s economy (the project
rehabilitates and reinforces power transmission and distribution facilities in the war-damaged
areas in Khatlon and Dushanbe regions, and rehabilitates the Nurek Power Plant and Central
Hydropower Plant). The Regional Power Transmission Modernization Project loan
($20 million in 2002) was geared towards improving the reliability and the operation of the
Central Asian power transmission system, enhancing the intercountry power trading between
Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, and laying the foundation for a future wholesale regional power
market. However, the later loan had to be cancelled due to the inability of Tajikistan and
Uzbekistan agreeing on the Power Trade Agreement. The Tajikistan-Afghanistan Power
Transmission Interconnection Project loan for $21.5 million to Tajikistan was approved in
2006. This project is aimed to construct a 220 kilovolt double circuit transmission line that
will link the hydropower stations on Tajikistan's Vakhsh River to the border town of Sherkan
Bandar, then to Kunduz, Baglad, Pul-e-Khumri and, ultimately, Kabul in Afghanistan. In
November 2008, ADB approved a $54.77 million grant for the Nurek 500 kV Switchyard
Reconstruction Project to rehabilitate an ageing facility in Tajikistan’s electricity supply
network which is in danger of collapse. Various technical assistance projects were provided
to accelerate market-oriented reforms in the power sector also in line with IMF and WB
programs and for supporting the government in formulating a power sector development
strategy.
5.
In addition to the above, the ADB Board approved to date the following loans to
Tajikistan in each sector:
6.
Social Sector: the Social Sector Rehabilitation Project loan ($20 million in 1999) to
address the serious deterioration in living standards and strengthen the delivery of essential
social services; the Health Sector Reform Project loan ($7.5 million in 2003) to improve
health, especially of the poor, women, and children by providing pro-poor health service
package, and by reforming the health service delivery and financing mechanism; and the
Education Sector Reform Project loan ($7.5 million in 2003), which focuses on supporting
the government’s reform priorities in primary (grades 1–4) and general secondary education
(grades 5–11) by improving the education system and its management. These two social
sector reform loans are supported by respective JFPR grants: (a) the project for Community
Participation and Public Information Campaign for Health Improvement ($1 million in
2004); and (b) the School Improvement Project ($2 million in 2004).
7.
Agriculture Sector: based on the agriculture sector assessment prepared during
1999–2000, the Agriculture Rehabilitation Project loan ($35 million in 2002) is being
implemented to improve living conditions of the farming communities in the project area and
to institute measures to sustain benefits of improvements for irrigation and drainage systems
and water supply, as well as by providing farm production support services. In order to

18
support the agriculture sector reforms, the TA for Farm Debt Resolution and Policy Reforms,
which was associated with the loan, has been completed in consultation with the IMF,
involving a wide range of stakeholders. Based on the findings of the TA, ADB supported the
government in close cooperation with other donors and NGOs for formulating a National
Farm Debt Resolution Strategy. ADB, in collaboration with DFID, supported donor
coordination for implementing the Strategy. On 5 March 2007, the Government approved the
Roadmap for Implementation of the Farm Debt Resolution Strategy. The road map, which
includes a comprehensive program of reforms for the sustainable and profitable farming of
cotton and other crops, guides the preparation of a suitable intervention for ADB. Grant
assistance for Rural Poverty Reduction Project ($2.9 million in 2001) financed by JFPR
supported implementation by pilot testing innovative poverty-oriented on- and off-farm
supports. In 2004, Irrigation Rehabilitation Project loan was approved for $22.7 million. In a
major push supporting the agriculture sector and rural development, Sustainable Cotton SubSector Project loan/grant and Rural Development Project loan/grant were approved in 2006
and 2007, respectively.
8.
Finance: Microfinance Systems Development Program loan ($4 million in 2003) to
support policy, legal, and regulatory reforms; and Microfinance Systems Development
Project loan ($4 million in 2003) to help transform nongovernmental organization
microfinance programs into licensed and regulated microfinance institutions.
9.
Trade Facilitation: the Regional Trade Facilitation and Customs Cooperation
Program loan ($10 million in 2002), which supported trade and customs reform development
across the East and Central Asia. Regional Customs Modernization and Infrastructure
Development ($10.7 million in 2004) to promote international trade and enabling
environment for private sector development.
10.
Emergency Assistance: in response to the government’s urgent requests, three
emergency loans, including the Emergency Flood Rehabilitation Project loan ($5 million in
1999), the Emergency Restoration of Yavan Water Conveyance System loan ($3.6 million in
2001), and the Emergency Baipaza Landslide Stabilization Project loan ($5.3 million in
2002) were approved. In 2007, ADB provided a $22 million loan for the Khatlon Province
Flood Risk Management Project to help address recurring flood risks in four districts in the
province through a comprehensive and coordinated approach. A major part of the project is
the rehabilitation of 8.3 kilometers of flood protection embankment along Pyanj River, which
borders Tajikistan and neighboring Afghanistan.
11.
In end-2000, ADB started supporting the government in developing PRSP through
participatory approach under a TA grant in close cooperation with the IMF, WB, and UNDP.
Following the finalization of the PRSP in June 2002, ADB concluded the Poverty Partnership
Agreement (PPA) with the government in December 2002, and proceeded to prepare a new
five-year Country Strategy and Program (CSP) for 2004–08 for Tajikistan, which was

19
endorsed by the ADB Board in October 2003. The CSP was successfully completed in 2008,
and its main objectives were (a) to strengthen rural development through institution building
that will support policy implementation and the private sector; (b) to rehabilitate power and
rural infrastructure; and (c) to strengthen regional cooperation through improved customs
services and transport links, both within the country and neighboring ones.
12.
ADB prepares and updates its three-year rolling programs for Tajikistan every year in
consultation with the government based on the ADF resources availability, carefully
examining the country’s social and economic development status and in coordination with
other donors, including IMF. The latest Country Operations Business Plan for Tajikistan
covering 2008–2010 was approved in October 2007. Currently, a joint country support strategy
for Tajikistan for 2009-2012 is being developed with the joint support of twelve development
partners working in the country, including ADB. The strategy is planned for finalization by
mid 2009 and expected to be managed through a result-based framework. ADB pays full
attention to the progress of Tajikistan’s MDG achievement. ADB is also paying intensive
attention to governance reforms through investment projects and technical assistance. In
2006, ADB approved a technical assistance project entitled Strengthening Results
Management in Support of Poverty Reduction in Tajikistan cofinanced by the Swedish
Government. The $2.0 million grant package co-financed by the Government of the
United Kingdom Department for International Development was approved in 2007 to help
boost the Tajikistan government's capacity in promoting private sector development.
13.
The proposed 2009-2010 investmnet program comprises three projects worth a total
of $102 million. The actual assistance level will be determined by (a) availability of overall
ADF resources; (b) country performance assessment vis-à-vis ADB’s policy on performance
based allocation of ADF resources; and (c) processing status of the projects in the pipeline.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on the Republic of Tajikistan
April 21, 2009
1.
This statement provides information on recent developments in Tajikistan that has
become available since the staff report was circulated to the Board on March 31, 2009. This
information does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
VIII. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
2.
Economic developments in the first quarter of 2009 were broadly as expected.
Remittance inflows declined by 30 percent year-on-year, in line with our projection for the
year as a whole. Real GDP growth reached 3½ percent, mainly driven by non-cotton
agriculture, trade, construction, and services. Inflation slowed further to 10 percent year-onyear at end-March.
3.
Based on preliminary data for end-March, the authorities appear broadly on
track toward meeting their end-June quantitative performance criteria:
•

While net international reserves declined, they did so by less than expected and stood
at $171 million at end-March, using current exchange rates. Staff estimates that, at
constant exchange rates, this is higher than the projections under the program.

•

Net domestic assets were also contained below the projections shown in the staff
report, and the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) refrained from extending new
loans to the private sector.

•

In the fiscal area, revenue collection appears lower than anticipated, mainly reflecting
subdued imports. At the same time, the authorities have contained spending by more
than projected. The government is in the process of preparing a revised 2009 budget
in line with the overall fiscal deficit target of ½ percent of GDP.
IX. PRIOR ACTIONS

4.

The authorities completed all five prior actions.

•

On April 9, the NBT published the executive summary of the special audit report on
its website at http://nbt.tj/en/files/docs/annual_report/rep_eng.pdf.

•

On March 26, the NBT adopted an action plan to address the issues and
recommendations from the special audit report. The action plan was developed in
close cooperation with staff.

2
•

On April 15, the NBT shared the draft report by Ernst&Young on the audit of the
NBT’s net international reserves position as of December 31, 2008.

•

On April 16, the NBT appointed KPMG as their external auditor to conduct the audit
of the NBT’s financial statements for the fiscal year ending April 30, 2009.

•

On March 26, the government submitted to parliament amendments to the
National Bank of Tajikistan law and a new commercial bank law in line with program
commitments.

5.
The audit of the NBT’s net international reserves position provides the necessary
assurances to the Fund. The auditors noted the excellent cooperation from the NBT, but
also emphasized weaknesses in the accounting systems and procedures. They identified
certain assets that should not be included in net international reserves as defined in the
technical memorandum of understanding, although this would not have a bearing on the
performance criterion on net international reserves. These assets amount to around $4 million
out of the reported net international reserves stock of $181 million. Going forward, staff
advises the authorities to implement the auditors' recommendations on net international
reserves accounting and enhance on-going net international reserves monitoring; the
authorities have already expressed their intentions to do so. In addition, staff will propose to
the authorities to conduct regular external audits of their net international reserves position
until the weaknesses in the accounting systems have been addressed.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
April 30, 2009

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with
the Republic of Tajikistan
On April 21, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
2009 Article IV consultation with Tajikistan. 1
Background
Economic developments in 2008 were favorable, despite a severe winter, a prolonged drought,
and electricity shortages. Real GDP growth reached 8 percent in 2008, mainly driven by
remittance-financed demand in the services and construction sectors, and non-cotton
agricultural production. Inflation receded from its mid-2008 peak, to 11 percent year-on-year in
February 2009. With strong domestic demand, the trade balance worsened in 2008. Imports
grew by around 36 percent, reflecting high international food and energy prices in the first half of
the year, while exports were held back by sluggish industrial activity. Despite this, the overall
balance of payments registered a surplus in 2008 as remittances surged by 50 percent.
The authorities completed their June–December 2008 staff-monitoring program. The
government achieved an overall fiscal surplus (excluding externally financed investment) of
1 percent of GDP, higher than targeted under the program, and mainly driven by buoyant
revenues. The associated build-up of government deposits at the National Bank of Tajikistan
(NBT) helped the NBT contain reserve money growth, while accumulating international reserves
at a faster pace than envisaged. Gross international reserves stood at $228 million at end-2008,
equivalent to 1.3 month of imports.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities.

2
In 2009, Tajikistan faces a negative external shock that is aggravated by domestic problems.
With the global slowdown—in particular in Russia—remittances are projected to decline by
30 percent in 2009. Moreover, exports (mainly cotton and aluminum) are projected to contract by
7 percent in value terms. This will require a large balance of payments adjustment, which will be
accompanied by weaker demand. On the supply side, ongoing electricity rationing and expected
water shortages during the agricultural season are weighing on growth. As such, real GDP
growth is projected to decline to 2 percent at best. Inflation should stabilize around 13 percent in
2009.
Tajikistan’s financial system remains vulnerable, despite improvements in some financial
soundness indicators during 2008. Some banks face severe funding problems due to large
corporates drawing down their deposits, a drying up of trade credits and advances for
remittances, and rising nonperforming loans. Moreover, the economic slowdown is expected to
deteriorate asset quality in 2009, and somoni depreciation could further add to the stress in the
banking sector. In response, most banks have started to raise deposit rates and have
constrained credit growth. In addition, the NBT has provided liquidity loans, mainly in somoni.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They welcomed the good
economic performance in 2008, but observed that Tajikistan is facing a severe external shock
from the global economic crisis, the effects of which are compounded by domestic rigidities.
Tajikistan is likely to be affected in particular by the serious regional downturn, which could lead
to a decline in remittance inflows, putting pressure on the external position and threatening the
livelihoods of many poor households that depend on remittances for basic income. Weakening
external demand is depressing the main exports—cotton and aluminum—further worsening the
external position. Continued heavy state influence over markets and poor energy infrastructure
put prospects for faster growth at risk. Poverty remains widespread, and could increase as the
economic outlook deteriorates
Against that background, Directors agreed that macroeconomic policies should be geared
toward maintaining external stability. They supported the planned restrained fiscal stance, while
commending the authorities for raising critical social expenditures. They called on the authorities
to fund only those investment projects that are likely to enhance growth prospects. They
welcomed the authorities’ commitment to tighten policies in the event of a prolonged or more
severe global economic downturn.
Directors commended the authorities for improving tax revenues and maintaining fiscal discipline
under the staff-monitored program, which has contributed to a further reduction in debt. They
encouraged the authorities to rely exclusively on concessional financing in the period ahead to
avoid a renewed buildup of unsustainable debt. They welcomed that the National Bank of
Tajikistan (NBT) had begun to rebuild international reserves in 2008.

3
Directors generally welcomed the authorities’ commitment to a flexible exchange rate regime,
which will help to contain the external current account deficit and support adjustment to external
shocks. They took note of the staff assessment that the real effective exchange rate of the
somoni could be overvalued. They endorsed the authorities’ intention to reduce excess volatility
in the foreign exchange market.
Directors observed that although the banking sector has not yet been affected by the global
financial crisis, it remains vulnerable, including through its exposure to the cotton sector and
deteriorating asset quality. They encouraged the authorities to move quickly to strengthen the
liquidity management framework, and with contingency plans to deal with distressed institutions.
Supervision should also be enhanced, and steps taken to ensure that banks adhere to regulatory
standards.
Directors endorsed the authorities’ structural reform agenda. They stressed the need to push
forward with agricultural sector reforms to remove rigidities and secure macroeconomic stability
and growth. Efforts will also be needed to enhance transparency and accountability in stateowned enterprises.
Directors welcomed the publication of the executive summary of the special audit of the NBT as
evidence of improved transparency and governance. They emphasized the crucial importance of
swift and comprehensive implementation of the audit recommendations.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Tajikistan will be held in accordance with
the Executive Board decision on the consultation cycle for members with Fund arrangements.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Approves US$116 Million PRGF Arrangement
for the Republic of Tajikistan

The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a three-year,
SDR 78.3 million (about US$116 million) arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility (PRGF) for the Republic of Tajikistan to support the authorities' economic
program. The decision will enable Tajikistan to draw the equivalent of SDR 26.1 million
(about US$38.7 million) from the IMF immediately.
The Executive Board also completed the final review under the Staff-Monitored Program
(SMP) and the 2009 Article IV consultation with Tajikistan. Details of the findings of the
Article IV will be published in a Public Information Notice in due course.
At the conclusion of the Executive Board's discussion of Tajikistan, Mr. John Lipsky, First
Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, made the following statement:
“Economic performance was good in 2008, but Tajikistan faces a severe external shock that
is being compounded by domestic rigidities. Reflecting the deterioration in global economic
conditions, remittance inflows are projected to decline in 2009. Tajikistan’s main exports,
cotton and aluminum, are adversely affected by weakening demand. The economy’s
resilience is constrained by the strong influence of the state in markets and poor energy
infrastructure, futher weakening the external position and slowing growth. Despite recent
gains, poverty remains widespread, and could increase again.
“Against this background, Tajikistan will receive financial assistance from the Fund under
the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility to help mitigate the effects of this crisis and to
support the authorities’ adjustment program. The authorities expect that the Fund’s
involvement will unlock budget support from the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank,
and the European Union.

2
“The authorities’ program aims to maintain financial and macroeconomic stability, while
alleviating the economic impact of the crisis by adopting a flexible exchange rate regime,
raising social and poverty-related expenditures, and laying the foundation for future growth.
Resolute implementation of the program should lower the external current account deficit to
a more sustainable level and restore growth rates.
“The authorities have made some difficult fiscal policy decisions. They have committed to
raising transfers to households in response to the economic crisis, and increasing resource
allocations for health and education, even though revenues are expected to decline on
account of the crisis. To achieve their overall deficit target, the authorities are delaying some
low-priority investment projects and scrutinizing current expenditures carefully.
“The authorities’ intention to further strengthen the governance of the central bank and the
management of monetary policy is welcome. The recent publication of the executive
summary of the report on the special audit of the National Bank of Tajikistan is an important
step in this regard. The report includes specific recommendations to address the deep-rooted
governance problems that contributed to the misreporting to the IMF that was revealed in
2007, and the Fund will monitor implementation of these recommendations under the PRGF
program. The authorities have already taken important first steps to address these problems,
such as submitting legal amendments to parliament that strengthen governance at the
National Bank of Tajikistan and seek to prevent future conflicts of interest, conducting an
external audit of the National Bank of Tajikistan’s net international reserves position as of
end-2008., and appointing an external auditor for the National Bank of Tajikistan’s financial
statements for this fiscal year.
“The authorities rightly emphasize ongoing reforms in the agriculture and energy sector. In
agriculture, addressing the cotton sector debt overhang and introducing a market-based
financing mechanism are necessary to raise the sector’s growth potential. In the energy
sector, restoring the financial health of the power utility would help safeguard budget
resources, and ensuring a reliable power supply would remove an important growth
bottleneck. More transparency and accountability are needed at state-owned enterprises to
ensure that budget resources are spent productively and that there is no buildup of contingent
liabilities,” Mr. Lipsky said.
ANNEX
Recent Economic Developments
Economic developments in 2008 were positive, despite a severe winter, a prolonged drought,
and electricity shortages. Real GDP growth reached 8 percent in 2008, mainly driven by
remittance-financed demand in the services and construction sectors, and non-cotton

3
agricultural production. Inflation receded from its mid-2008 peak to 10 percent year-on-year
in March 2009, helped by the recent retrenchment in international commodity prices.
The authorities achieved an overall fiscal surplus of 1 percent of GDP (excluding externally
financed investment) in 2008, compared to a target of overall balance under the SMP.
Revenues were buoyant, mostly reflecting high nominal GDP and import growth, as well as
some administrative gains. At the same time, the authorities maintained strict expenditure
control.
Helped by the inflow of remittances, the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) strengthened its
net international reserves position to $181 million at end-December 2008. However, gross
international reserves of $199 million covered only 1.2 month of next year’s imports. Since
the beginning of the year, remittances inflows have declined absolute terms, and the Tajik
somoni has depreciated by over 10 percent against the U.S. dollar.
The authorities have also taken important first steps to address the problems that were at the
root of misreporting to the IMF that was revealed in late 2007. Specifically, they ended the
NBT’s involvement in cotton financing and submitted legal amendments to parliament that
would strengthen governance at the NBT and prevent future conflicts of interest. The
authorities also retained an external auditor to conduct a special audit of the NBT. As a signal
of the authorities’ commitment to transparency, the Executive Summary of the special audit
report was recently published on the NBT’s web site. Moreover, they prepared an action plan
to follow up on the auditor’s recommendations. The IMF will monitor implementation of this
action plan under the PRGF. Lastly, the NBT has appointed an external auditor to conduct an
audit of its financial statements for the fiscal year ending April 30, 2009, and they have
conducted an external audit of Tajikistan’s net international reserves position at end-2008.
Program Summary
The authorities’ policies under the PRGF-supported economic program aim to:
•
Facilitate external adjustment in 2009 through exchange rate flexibility while
allowing for rising social spending needs;
•
Lay the foundation for medium-term growth and ensuring that there is no build-up of
external debt;
•
Achieve structural reforms in the areas of central bank governance, state-owned
enterprises, and the agriculture sector.
Tajikistan, which became a member of the IMF on April 27, 1993, has a quota of SDR 87.0
million (about US$129 million).

Statement by Thomas Moser, Executive Director for Republic of Tajikistan
April 13, 2009
1.
Our Tajik authorities would like to thank the staff for the constructive discussions and
policy advice. They consider the Fund’s engagement in Tajikistan important to help them
preserve macroeconomic stability and maintain a reform momentum. This is particularly
important in the current environment. With the world economy experiencing a highly
synchronized global downturn and growth in the region and in Russia slowing sharply,
Tajikistan will be particularly affected. Tajikistan is one of the poorest countries in the world,
and the recent staff report on The Implications of the Global Financial Crisis for Low-Income
Countries as well as the World Bank report on The Global Economic Crisis: Assessing
Vulnerability with a Poverty Lens have identified Tajikistan as one of the low-income
countries that are particularly vulnerable to the unfolding crisis.
2.
With almost half of Tajikistan’s labor force having worked outside the country,
particularly in Russia and Kazakhstan, and remittances amounting to almost half of
Tajikistan’s GDP, the expected sharp decline in remittances and the possible return of
migrant workers will pose significant challenges for Tajikistan. This, together with the
decline in the demand and price for Tajikistan’s key exports (aluminum and cotton), ongoing
problems with electricity shortages, and a sharp increase in prices for natural gas imports,
puts enormous pressures on the balance of payments, opening a large external financing gap
and requiring significant adjustment. The Tajik authorities are thus requesting IMF support
under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) to cushion the large external
shocks. Given the low level of reserves and the size of the shock, the Tajik authorities fear,
however, that the proposed level of access may prove insufficient.
Performance under the Staff-Monitored Program
3.
The authorities have successfully completed the 2008 Staff-Monitored Program
(SMP), despite a difficult economic environment. In fact, they overperformed on most
program targets. Specifically, they achieved economic growth of 7.9 percent against a
projected 5.0 percent, an inflation rate of 11.8 percent against a projected 15 percent, a fiscal
surplus of 1.3 percent of GDP against a programmed zero fiscal deficit, and they accumulated
gross international reserves of $199 million against a projected $169 million. The Tajik
authorities also completed the special audit of the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT), which
was conducted by Ernst & Young London, and repaid all noncomplying disbursements to the
Fund. Tajikistan has currently no outstanding IMF loans. The Executive Summary of the
Special Audit has been published in English and Russian, and is available on the website of
the NBT.[1] The authorities have adopted a comprehensive action plan to address all issues
and recommendations of the Special Audit, and have already started with its implementation.

Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
4.
Since early 2009, the impact of the global crisis has become more evident. Incoming
data shows that during the first quarter of 2009 remittances have already fallen by 30 percent,
exports by almost 50 percent, industrial output by 8.2 percent and revenues by more than
20 percent compared with the first quarter of last year. The trade balance widened
significantly to a record 50.1 percent of GDP. Since remittances historically are higher
through May-November of each year, a higher decline in remittances is expected to occur
during May-November of 2009. In addition, the energy crisis has become more acute, not
only because a neighboring country stopped the transit of electricity imports, but also because
of insufficient water levels in the reservoirs of operating hydropower plants. As a result, a
large part of the country experiences severe power shortages, causing significant damage to
the well-being of the population and to businesses. Industrial and agricultural output will be
adversely affected, 30 percent of agricultural land being irrigated by water pumps.
Agricultural output will also be adversely affected by the forecasted drought and the renewed
locust invasion, which has started earlier this year and affected more than 20 percent of
irrigable land last year.
5.
Given incoming data, it is very likely that the significant downside risks to the
projections mentioned in the staff report materialize, and that the financing gap will be larger
than anticipated. The staff report points out that there is a high risk that if remittances were to
decline by an additional 5 percentage points in 2009, Tajikistan’s external financial needs
would rise by another US$110 million, which is substantial. Thus, together with the projected
US$154 million this would result in a total external financial gap of US$264 million. Further
expenditure restraints would result in additional delays in infrastructure spending, and a sharp
depreciation of the exchange rate would adversely affect the banking system. These adverse
developments will also lead to a reversal of the recent declines in poverty in Tajikistan,
raising the share of population below the poverty line above the current 53 percent, with rural
areas stronger affected than urban zones.
Request for a New PRGF Arrangement
6.
Our Tajik authorities have committed to a strong PRGF arrangement, containing
substantive conditionality for 2009. They have identified expenditure cuts of 1.5 percent of
GDP in current spending, and of 2.5 percent of GDP in capital spending, and committed
themselves to address governance issues at the NBT and major state-owned enterprises
(SOEs). With the help of a government consultant and in close cooperation with the World
Bank and the Asian Development Bank, they are also determined to resolve the long-standing
cotton debt problem.
7.
In their Special Audit Report, E&Y have specifically highlighted the good
cooperation of the new NBT Chairman, who resolutely started to improve governance at the

3
NBT since taking office in early 2008. A set of amendments to the NBT and Commercial
Banking Laws has been submitted to Parliament, going beyond the commitments that the
authorities have made under the SMP. The new Chairman is also expediting improvements in
the NBT’s monetary policy and banking supervision operations.
8.
The Ministry of Finance established an SOE supervision unit, with the aim to put
SOEs on a sound financial footing, improve their tax compliance, and eliminate their quasifiscal deficits. The Ministry’s efforts will particularly focus on the two largest SOEs, the
Tajikistan Aluminum Company (Talco) and power utility Barki Tajik. The authorities will
continue with the tariff adjustments agreed with the World Bank, with the objective to
achieve cost recovery by end-2010. The authorities have also adopted an external debt
strategy that sets a ceiling on the external debt-to-GDP ratio of 40 percent, in line with staff
advice.
9.
Our Tajik authorities acknowledge that the proposed access of 90 percent of quota
(ca. US$120 million) with significant frontloading in 2009 is above the norm, for which they
are grateful to the staff and to management. However, given the size of the external shock,
the significant downside risks and the specific vulnerability of Tajikistan, as well as the
good performance under the SMP and the strength of the program, the Tajik
authorities would kindly request Executive Directors to consider the possibility of
doubling this access to 180 percent of quota, with substantial frontloading in 2009. Even
without the envisaged doubling of access limits for low-income countries, current access
limits for PRGFs allow for 185 percent of quota in exceptional circumstances. Our Tajik
authorities consider the current circumstances to be exceptional, and access of 180 percent
would better help Tajikistan to avoid an unnecessarily disruptive economic adjustment, and
to adequately manage the impact of the global economic and financial crisis on the highly
vulnerable economy.
