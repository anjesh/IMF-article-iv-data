STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
October 29, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context. GDP growth is likely to remain strong, although narrowly driven by a mining
investment boom, increasing the economy’s vulnerability to terms of trade shocks.
Outside the mining sector, growth is expected to be slow with still weak consumer
confidence and a strong exchange rate weighing on business investment. The main
risks are external, and include an intensification of the euro crisis and a sharper-thanexpected slowdown in China.
Focus. Discussions centered on the policy-mix to maintain steady growth in the near
term and the macro and structural policy options to make the most of the mining
boom over the long run.
Near-term macroeconomic policy mix. The current macroeconomic policy mix is
appropriate. With expected inflation within the target range, the strong Australian
dollar, and the government’s efforts to return the budget to surplus this year, monetary
policy should remain accommodative, and should act as the first line of defense against
near-term adverse shocks. The authorities’ fiscal consolidation path strikes a balance
between the benefits of reducing public debt and the need to contain any adverse
impact on economic growth.
Financial stability. A Financial Sector Assessment Program update found the financial
sector to be sound, and recommended that the authorities continue to emphasize
intensive supervision and ensure that banks’ liquidity and capital buffers are adequate
given their reliance on offshore wholesale funding, exposure to highly indebted
households, and the systemic importance of the large banks.
The challenge of economic and structural adjustment. The resources sector will
remain a key driver of economic growth in the near term, with historically high mining
sector investment projected over the next two years boosting Australia’s export
capacity. A key structural policy challenge is to facilitate the movement of resources
across the economy, as well as to manage the increased vulnerability to terms of trade
shocks.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
1.

Growth. The Australian economy has been growing faster than most advanced countries,

benefiting from its trade linkages with Asia, particularly China. Growth accelerated from 2¾ percent
in the second half of 2011 to 4 percent in the first half of 2012, driven by private domestic demand
and exports (Figure 1, Table 1). However, growth has been uneven with mining-related sectors
expanding strongly, in contrast with below-trend growth in other sectors. The high Australian dollar
is weighing on trade-exposed manufacturing and tourism, which along with the uncertain global
economic outlook is contributing to a broadly pessimistic mood. With cautious homebuyers and
weak business confidence, investment growth outside the mining sector is weak.
2.

Household sector. Although survey measures of consumer and business sentiment

remained below their long-run averages,

Terms of trade and the exchange rate.

Australia’s terms of trade peaked in 2011, pushing
up the real effective exchange rate further and
narrowing the current account deficit to 2¼ percent
of GDP. By the second quarter of 2012, the terms of
trade had fallen by around 10 percent, driven by

recent months, however, the Australian dollar has remained high despite lower export commodity
prices and the weaker global outlook, in part related to portfolio reallocations of large reserve
holders toward Australian government debt.
5.

Carbon price. Australia introduced a price on carbon in July 2012 with the objective of

reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to at least 5 percent below 2000 levels by
2020. The introduction of the carbon price is not expected to have any significant impact on
economic growth but is expected to increase inflation by ¾ percentage points by end June 2013.
Low- and middle-income households will be compensated through increases in the income tax free
thresholds, and welfare beneficiaries will be compensated for cost of living increase associated with
the scheme.1
6.

Inflation. CPI inflation has eased with underlying measures of inflation remaining near the

middle of the 2-3 percent target band, largely due to the declining tradable goods prices associated
with the appreciation of the exchange rate (Figure 3). Wage growth is also moderate, just marginally
above its 10 year average in June 2012 with private sector wage growth faster than in the public
sector.
7.

Monetary policy. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has lowered the policy rate by

150 basis points since November 2011, with the most recent cut in October 2012. Initially, when
inflation moderated at the end 2011, the RBA moved to remove a mildly restrictive monetary policy
stance. During 2012, as the outlook for the global economy deteriorated accompanied by a slightly
weaker domestic outlook for 2013, and with projected inflation consistent with the target, the RBA
shifted to an accommodative monetary policy stance. Interest rates for borrowers, a key indicator of
the overall stance, are now slightly below their medium-term averages.

8.

Fiscal policy. The 2011/12 underlying cash deficit came in at 3 percent of GDP, about

1½ percentage points higher than forecast in the 2011-12 Budget, due to both weaker receipts and
higher expenditure. Structural factors have kept receipts as a percent of GDP below pre-crisis levels
and have also contributed to receipts falling short of projections by 0.9 percent of GDP during
2011/12. High levels of mining sector investment and associated depreciation deductions have
dampened growth in mining company tax receipts relative to profit growth. Changing consumer
spending patterns away from the retail sector towards services have lowered retail company tax
receipts. Furthermore, lower house and equity price growth rates, especially compared with precrisis rates, lowered capital gains tax receipts. Payments during 2011/12 exceeded forecasts by
0.6 percent of GDP mainly due to payments related to natural disasters and the accelerated transfer
payments to households and businesses as compensation for higher energy costs following the
introduction of carbon price.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
9.

Near-term outlook. The outlook for Australia remains favorable, buoyed by still-high

growth in China accompanied by strong commodity demand which is supporting Australia’s export
earnings and driving a mining investment boom. We project growth of around 3¼ percent this year,
broadly in line with trend. New natural resources-related investment, dominated by liquefied natural
gas projects, is expected to reach a record level (text figure). On the other hand, with an appreciated
Australian dollar, uncertain global environment, and sluggish housing construction, investment
outside of the resources sector is likely to
remain weak in the near term. The impact of

Vulnerabilities and risks. Fundamentals have improved since the global financial crisis;

household and business balance sheets have strengthened and banks have reduced their use of
foreign funding. Nevertheless, vulnerabilities remain. Risks are tilted to the downside (Appendix 1):

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

AUSTRALIA



The impact of a financial and economic fallout from an intensification of the European debt crisis
and a hard landing in emerging Asia, especially China, could be compounded by a sharp decline
in commodity prices.



Turmoil in the international financial markets remains a concern as Australia’s banks will
continue to rely on overseas wholesale funding.



Domestically, despite a recovery in the household savings rate and a recent softening of house
prices, high household debt coupled with elevated house prices remains a vulnerability. A
potential fall in commercial real estate prices is also a risk.

Many of the above risks are closely linked, and the importance of the resources sector to Australia’s
near-term outlook makes it vulnerable if a downside global scenario materializes. For example, a
hard landing in China would reduce demand for Australian mineral exports, worsen terms of trade,
reduce household income, and could trigger a fall in house prices. This in turn would weaken
consumer demand and growth, and negatively affect banks’ balance sheets.
11.

Policy space to manage risks. The authorities have the monetary and fiscal policy space to

respond to near-term shocks, with monetary policy serving as the first line of defense. The RBA has
the scope to lower interest rates and loosen monetary conditions to help buffer against a downside
scenario. As evident during the global financial crisis, the free-floating Australian dollar provides an
additional cushion against external shocks, including disruptions to offshore funding and negative
terms of trade shocks, with widespread hedging by banks insulating bank balance sheets from
fluctuations in the exchange rate. The authorities would also be able to provide emergency liquidity
support to banks, a measure which proved effective when wholesale markets shut down in the wake
of the 2008 crisis. Moreover, Australia’s modest public debt gives the authorities scope to delay their
planned return to surplus in the event of a sharp deterioration in the economic outlook.
The Authorities’ Views
12.

The authorities broadly agreed with staff on the outlook and balance of risks, expecting the

key growth drivers in the near term to be resources investment, related commodity exports, and
household demand. They view the main risks to the economy as linked with external developments,
including disruptions to European financial markets, the threat of sharp fiscal contraction in the
United States, and a fall in Chinese growth momentum. A fall in commodity prices remains a
vulnerability, but with many projects—of which approximately 70 percent are LNG and are
associated with long-term supply contracts—already under construction or committed, the
investment outlook is likely to be resilient to cyclical commodity price declines. They also pointed to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

AUSTRALIA

relatively weak growth in some parts of the economy—the strong dollar is placing pressure on the
non-mining traded sector and the uncertain external environment is weighing on domestic
confidence—but noted that household demand remains robust and that the effects of earlier
reductions in the cash rate were still working through the domestic economy. The authorities
acknowledged that despite recent improvements related to rising incomes and softening in house
prices, some metrics of housing affordability are still low by historical standards. They viewed this,
however, as consistent with fundamentals reflecting both supply constraints in major cities and high
demand from population growth on top of the one-off increase in equilibrium prices resulting from
past disinflation. Given this, they do not see a major house-price correction as a stand-alone risk.

NEAR-TERM CHALLENGE: KEEPING THE ECONOMY ON
AN EVEN KEEL
13.

Monetary policy. Staff viewed the RBA’s monetary policy stance as broadly appropriate,

given the sizeable fiscal adjustment and the absence of inflation pressure, and factoring in higher
bank funding costs, the appreciated exchange rate, and modest overall lending growth.2 Analysis by
staff suggests that the cash rate is compatible with inflation gradually rising to the mid-point of the
RBA’s 2–3 percent inflation target in 2013 (Figure 4). This projection is premised on wages rising
broadly in line with productivity and the RBA’s inflation target.
14.

Fiscal policy. The government has made returning to surplus by 2012/13 a major policy

priority. To reach this target, the government expects a rebound in receipts by 1½ percent of GDP
and plans cuts in spending by about the same amount (Figure 5, Table 3). About 1 percent of the
adjustment is achieved through expenditure restraint across a broad range of discretionary
categories. Most of the adjustment in receipts will occur as receipts catch up with output growth
(about ¾ percent of GDP), rather than changes in tax rates. Some of the other increases in receipts,
such as those related to the introduction of minerals taxation (paragraph 19), are unlikely to affect
investment decisions in the short run. These factors should help mitigate the impact of the planned
deficit reduction on aggregate demand. In addition, unlike many other advanced economies,
Australia’s monetary policy space is still sizable and output is close to trend. These conditions
suggest that the fiscal multiplier could be lower than in other countries undergoing fiscal
consolidation, mitigating its negative impact on output. Given this and the nature of the fiscal

2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

AUSTRALIA

adjustment, staff estimates that the contractionary impact of this budget will be less than would be
suggested by the headline deficit reduction of 3 percent (Box 1).
15.

Macroeconomic policy-mix. Staff supported the authorities’ move toward a policy-mix that

combines a tighter fiscal policy with an accommodative monetary policy stance, which will help ease
pressure on the exchange rate. The fiscal consolidation is consistent with a policy setting where
monetary policy plays the primary role in managing demand. The RBA’s high degree of credibility
and the rapid monetary policy transmission in Australia allows monetary policy to react quickly and
flexibly to changing economic circumstances. Staff supported the authorities’ strong commitment to
a freely-floating exchange rate. The government’s planned fiscal consolidation will produce a
desirable reduction in net government debt.
The Authorities’ Views
16.

Monetary Policy. In its early October monetary policy announcement and, in discussions

during the mission in September, the RBA noted that with inflation projected to remain consistent
with their target and in light of a softening outlook for the global economy and slightly weaker
domestic growth prospects, there was some scope for a more accommodative monetary policy
stance. As a result of moves since late last year, interest rates for borrowers are a little below
medium-term averages but the impact of these reductions has not, as yet, been fully felt.
17.

Fiscal Policy. The authorities expressed the view that the impact on the economy of the

return to surplus was significantly lower than the change in the headline fiscal position this year—
subtracting ¾ to1½ percent from GDP growth—and in the context of an economy growing at
around trend, and with adequate monetary policy space, did not present a policy challenge.
Moreover, it is consistent with the government’s medium-term fiscal framework. During the crisis
they provided a strong fiscal impulse with the commitment to unwind fiscal support once the crisis
was over and growth had returned to trend. Returning to surplus and maintaining fiscal discipline
would therefore be important for sustaining investor confidence in the strength of Australia’s public
finances and signaling the government’s commitment to maintaining its fiscal strategy. The
authorities acknowledged a risk that achieving the surplus could be jeopardized if revenue were to
fall short, in part if the economy underperformed relative to projections. If a major shock hits the
economy, the authorities agree that they have the fiscal space to respond.

Box 1: Household Saving and Fiscal Multipliers
Australia’s household saving as a share of GDP began increasing in 2005 and then increased
sharply as the global financial crisis began to unfold. Household saving ratio (household savings
to household disposable income) also rose by more than 5 percentage points in 2008-2009. Since
then both ratios seem to have stabilized at levels above the pre-crisis averages.
The sharp increase in household saving in 2008-2009 reflected both slower growth in private
consumption and a temporary boost to household income, with a significant contribution from
the cash transfers paid to households as part of the government’s fiscal stimulus package during
the crisis (fiscal stimulus averaging about 2 percent of GDP a year in 2009-2011). Meanwhile
household interest payments declined by more than 30% between the third quarter of 2008 and
the first quarter of 2009, largely due to monetary policy easing. As Australia’s economy was in a
relatively strong position at the onset of the global financial crisis, the rapid deployment of fiscal
and monetary stimulus measures helped buffer the negative impact of the crisis on household
income and private demand.
As suggested in the IMF Fiscal Monitor (April 2012), the size of fiscal multipliers can vary
significantly by the underlying state of the economy – the multipliers tend to be larger in
downturns than in expansions as the crowding out effect between public and private spending is
less applicable when there are excess capacities in the economy. Given that Australia’s economy is
close to potential, the contractionary impact of the current fiscal consolidation is likely to be
smaller than in other countries undergoing similar fiscal adjustment but with large negative
output gaps, and the impact could also be mitigated by Australia’s still-sizable monetary policy
space. These results are broadly in line with those suggested by the Global Integrated Monetary
and Fiscal (GIMF) model simulations.
Going forward, Australia’s household saving ratio is likely to decline modestly as interest rates
normalize and household sentiment improves. But the saving ratio will remain above the pre-crisis
levels as the persistently strong capital gains in household assets in the 1990s and 2000s, which
allowed households to enjoy rising wealth with low rate of saving, are unlikely to be repeated in
the near future.

MEDIUM-TERM FISCAL POLICY
18.

Fiscal Strategy. The government’s fiscal strategy has remained unchanged since first

developed in 2008-09. It envisages three pillars: achieving budget surpluses, on average, over the
medium term; keeping taxation as a share of GDP below the 2007–08 level on average (23.7 percent
of GDP); and improving the government’s net financial worth over the medium term. To achieve this
aim, the government is committed to limiting spending growth. In particular, while the economy is
growing at or above trend, real spending growth, on average, will be capped at 2 percent annually
until surpluses are at least 1 percent of GDP. This strategy is projected to yield small surpluses
which gradually increase from ¼ percent of GDP in 2013/14 to 1 percent of GDP in 2015/16. As a
result, net commonwealth debt, already low by international comparison (Figure 6), will fall from
about 10 percent of GDP in 2012 to zero by 2020/21. Outside the Commonwealth budget, the
States and Territories also anticipate a gradual reduction in expenditure over the medium term, in
part through public sector wage control measures, to maintain their reputation among international
bondholders for fiscal discipline in the face of lower projected GST revenues.
19.

Tax Policy. Staff supports the recent tax initiatives. Following a comprehensive review of the

Australian tax system in 2010 (Australia’s Future Tax System), the authorities implemented on July 1,
2012 a number of tax reforms that include a minerals resource rent tax (MRRT), a broadening of the
base of the petroleum resource rent tax (PRRT), and a carbon price with a transition to emissions
trading over time. Staff welcomed the introduction of the MRRT and broadening of the base of the
PRRT and continues to support the carbon price, which is well-designed along FAD
recommendations and intended to be fiscally neutral.
20.

Fiscal Policy Management. While monetary policy is expected to be the main demand

management tool in the medium-term, fiscal policy can, nevertheless, play a role in responding to
economic shocks. In this regard, staff recommended that the automatic stabilizers be allowed to
move fully in both directions. Staff noted that the growing importance for the economy of mining
exposes government revenue, more than in past years, to swings in commodity income.
21.

Medium-term fiscal challenges. Over the medium-term, the authorities are facing an

increase in expenditure commitments, primarily related to aging and health care costs, which
together are estimated to increase public expenditure by over 3 percent of GDP by 2030. With
revenue currently well below the government’s cap of 23.7 percent of GDP—around 21.0 percent of
GDP in 2011/12 —there is some room to accommodate the higher spending needs through
increases in revenue. Even so a re-prioritization of spending would likely be needed to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

AUSTRALIA

accommodate the additional commitments and produce budget surpluses if the revenue ceiling is
maintained. A sustained shock to the terms of trade would add to these challenges.3
The Authorities’ Views
22.

The authorities agreed with staff on the role of automatic stabilizers in fiscal policy

management. They acknowledged the medium-term budgetary challenges. They noted that the
revenue ceiling is based on 2007-08 receipts and as such reflects temporary factors that contributed
to unusually high receipts in the pre-crisis period, namely, high capital gains taxes boosted by
surging asset prices, rapidly rising commodity prices, rapid credit growth and a low household
savings rate. Moreover, structural changes to the tax base that have taken place during the recovery
from the crisis, such as shifting consumption patterns, lower asset price growth and higher
depreciation deductions, are likely to persist. As such, the authorities do not expect the revenue
ceiling to be a binding constraint over the next several years if the current tax policy framework is
maintained. The authorities’ strategy for managing the public sector proceeds from increased
mining exports does not envisage accumulating assets in an earmarked sovereign wealth fund—
unlike other commodity producing countries with such funds, the share of Australia’s mining sector
in the economy (projected to increase to around 10 percent of GDP) and its contribution to public
revenue will still remain limited even after the expansion, and minable resources are expected to be
long-lasting rather than temporary. Instead, the authorities plan, in the first instance, is for the tax
proceeds to contribute more generally to the gradual reduction in gross public sector debt, which
provides for equivalent outcomes as a formal fund.

Previous staff estimates suggest that a sustained 30 percent decline in the terms of trade, partly offset by exchange
rate depreciation, could worsen the budget balance by 2 percent of GDP.

12 months with S&P downgrading all four major banks in December 2011, a well-anticipated move
that was driven by revised methodology. Fitch also downgraded three major banks earlier this year,
citing risks posed by banks’ reliance on offshore wholesale funding. Bank credit default swaps
spreads are above pre-crisis levels yet below those for European banks (Figure 8).
24.

Funding. Since the financial crisis, reflecting lessons learned and the changing regulatory

environment, banks have shifted toward more stable funding sources facilitated by combination of
strong overall deposit growth and slower credit growth. Reliance on wholesale funding has been
reduced and deposits now currently meet more than 50 percent of banks’ funding requirements.
Much of the decline in wholesale funding has been driven by declines in domestic short-term debt
further improving the stability of banks’ funding—the share of short-term debt has fallen from a
peak of over 30 percent to about 20 percent. Legislative changes in October 2011 permitted
Australian banks to issue covered bonds and since then the major banks have used around onequarter of their covered bond issuance capacity. So far this year, covered bonds accounted for about
one-third of banks’ bond issuance, with the remainder unsecured. The increased competition for
deposits has pushed up the spread of deposit to money market rates, and, together with a move to
more stable funding sources, contributed to higher funding costs.
25.

Vulnerabilities. The banking system is large, highly concentrated, and interconnected. The

four major banks are systemic, with broadly similar business models, and their reliance on wholesale
and off-shore funding, although below pre-crisis levels, still represents a risk. Residential mortgages
are the banks’ single largest asset but household debt is high and house prices are elevated. These
are long-standing structural issues that will remain key sources of risk over the medium-term. Stress
testing indicates that the major banks are adequately capitalized and are likely to withstand severe
macroeconomic shocks, but would require the assistance of the RBA to withstand an extreme
funding shock. Net foreign liabilities of the banks amount to almost 25 percent of GDP. Although
predominately in foreign currency, these positions are hedged and counterparty risk is limited. The
banking sector faces the prospect of slower credit growth as businesses and households continue to
deleverage, and could take on riskier strategies in an effort to return to pre-crisis credit and profit
growth rates.
26.

Financial sector reform. Capital ratios are increasing and the banks are well-placed to meet

Basel III capital requirements and Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA)’s accelerated
timetable for implementation (Box 2). Total capital has increased, largely due to dividend reinvestment
plans and higher retained earnings which boosted Tier 1 capital. Banks have shifted the composition of
their portfolios towards assets with lower risk weights, such as mortgages and government

have substituted holdings of short-term bank paper for

assets compared with 6 percent in March 2007.

However, Australia faces a shortage of such high-quality liquid assets. In particular, a long-period of prudent fiscal
policy has resulted in a low supply of CGS relative to the size and liquidity needs of the financial sector. In addition,
overseas demand for CGSs is high with a sizeable share held by non-residents, including by institutional investors that
tend to hold assets to maturity, further reducing the depth of the CGS market. Other Basel III reforms, such as
collateral requirements for derivative contracts, are expected to further increase the demand for high quality liquid
assets.
With some other countries also facing a shortage of high-quality liquid assets, the Basel III framework allows for
alternative approaches. The RBA and APRA have adopted one of these approaches, a committed liquidity facility,
where banks can establish a secure liquidity facility with the RBA, for which they are charged an ongoing fee. The
facility is designed to cover any shortfall between a bank’s holdings of high-quality liquid assets and the LCR
requirement. However banks are required to hold more high-quality liquid assets and cannot solely rely on the facility
to meet the LCR.
APRA intends to adopt the counter-cyclical capital buffer as part of its implementation of the Basel III reforms.
However, it is likely to go beyond the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)’s proposed benchmark—the
de-trended ratio of credit to GDP—as its guide to deploy the buffer. Any such decisions are likely be made in
consultation with the Reserve Bank of Australia, be based on a wide array of data, and with additional capital serving
as a complement to other prudential tools.

27.

Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). Staff reiterated the recommendations from

an FSAP update conducted over the past months4. To further bolster financial system stability,
higher loss absorbency for systemically important institutions may be desirable, as part of a multipronged approach, that includes supervision and recovery and resolution planning. The FSAP
mission identified room for improvement in certain areas of supervision, recommending greater
depth and intensity in APRA’s supervision of liquidity risk through more time allocated to formal onsite review, and that Australia Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) be given more
resources and flexibility over its operational budget. The FSAP mission recommended that the RBA
develop macro-financial stress tests which could enhance its ability to identify and monitor
emerging systemic risks and APRA devote more resources to stress testing. To ensure that the
banking industry bears at least part of the cost of bank failures, the FSAP mission recommended
that the authorities re-evaluate the merits of an ex ante funded deposit insurance scheme. While
banks are making efforts to change funding structure, the FSAP mission stressed the importance of
encouraging banks to continue to lengthen the maturity of offshore funding and increase their
domestic funding.
The Authorities’ Views
28.

The authorities broadly agreed with the staff assessment of financial sector

vulnerabilities. They acknowledged that banks are heavily exposed to household debt and that
house prices are high by historical standards but, as discussed above, they do not see a fall in house
prices as a stand-alone risk and note that other kinds of bank lending have proven to be more
important drivers of losses in many countries over recent years. Moreover, stringent under-writing
standards, based on serviceability rather than collateral, improve the resiliency of bank balance
sheets to declines in house prices, consistent with the results of recent stress testing. Significant
prepayment buffers—funds that borrowers can draw on to stay current with their loan, amounting
to over 10 percent of the outstanding stock of housing loans and equivalent to about 18 months
payment—further mitigate the risk to the banking sector of significant stress in the housing market
or a sharp increase in unemployment. Improvements in banks’ funding profiles have reduced the
macroeconomic vulnerability to bank funding stress that would arise if the global funding markets
become closed to all banks, regardless of individual strength. Due to their relative strength

compared with banks in other countries, Australian banks were able to take advantage of periods of
relative financial market calm earlier this year to move ahead of their annual funding targets.
29.

The authorities welcomed the main conclusions of the FSAP and noted that the

process involved good, robust, and constructive discussions. Overall, they agreed with the
assessment that the Australian financial system was resilient through the global financial crisis; the
banks are well-capitalized, profitable, and well-positioned to implement Basel III capital reforms; and
with the assessment of vulnerabilities, risks and mitigating factors identified during the FSAP
process. In terms of the recommendations, the authorities emphasized the importance of intensive
supervision as a tool for mitigating risks created by large, systemic banks. They will consider next
steps on higher loss absorbency following G-20 endorsement of the Basel Committee’s
recommendations for domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs).

ASSESSING EXTERNAL STABILITY

Current account. The current account deficit is projected to widen to 4 percent of GDP in

2012 as import volumes pick up, especially for capital goods (Figure 9, Table 5). Over the medium
term, assuming a constant real exchange rate, the deficit is projected to reach 6 percent of GDP as
investment in the resources sector reaches its peak, increasing mining-related imports by about
2 percent of GDP, and the terms of trade and
interest rates on external borrowing normalize.

notwithstanding increases in availability of Commonwealth Government Securities, has increased the
share held by non-residents to three-quarters of the total outstanding stock, an increase of over
15 percentage points compared with end-2009 (text figure). Over the past year, there have been net
private sector equity inflow, including into the mining sector to finance investment, and net outflows
of debt largely from the banking sector as existing debt matured.

Exchange rate assessment. Australia’s free floating exchange rate will continue to provide

the economy with an important buffer, particularly to fluctuations in global commodity demand. In
addition, a strong Australian dollar plays a necessary role in reallocating domestic resources away
from other tradable sectors, accelerating structural change. At the same time, staff estimates that
the exchange rate is currently stronger than would be consistent with this adjustment, and at its
current level, if continued, would likely result in an increase in banks’ net foreign liabilities going
forward (Box 3).5 Although Australia’s gross external debt is low by advanced country standards, net
external liabilities remain relatively high (Figure 10). There are a number of factors contributing to
the current high level of the Australian dollar, including the relative strength of the Australian
economy, the gap between domestic and foreign interest rates and more recently, ongoing strong
foreign demand for Commonwealth Government Securities. If these factors were to ease, the
exchange rate would likely depreciate, reducing

The Authorities’ Views
33.

The authorities viewed much of the projected widening of the current account deficit

as sustainable, related to major investment projects in mining financed by foreign
investment, retained earnings, and long-term debt. As the investment phase of the mining boom
comes to an end, mining sector export volumes are expected to increase and capital imports retreat,
narrowing the current account deficit. The authorities reiterated their strong commitment to a
freely-floating exchange rate, which should play a key role in containing external vulnerabilities. In
contrast to past mining booms, the floating exchange rate has helped the economy to absorb a
sharp increase in terms of trade without leading to an overheating domestic economy and a spike in
inflation. They acknowledged staff’s assessment that the exchange rate is modestly overvalued

5

Model-based approaches, while involving a high degree of uncertainty, suggest that the real exchange rate is
10-20 percent above the level predicted by Australia-specific factors. This assessment is sensitive to projections of
saving behavior and the nature of the investment boom.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

AUSTRALIA

Box 3. External Sector Assessment 1/
Australia’s real effective exchange rate has remained relatively high in 2012, while the current account is
beginning to widen as capital imports grow and commodity prices fall. After appreciating by over
90 percent from 2003 to the third quarter of 2011, Australia’s terms of trade has declined. The real
exchange rate remains 32 percent above its 1983-2012 average, while the current account deficit
widened from 2¼ percent of GDP in 2011 to 3¼ percent in the first half of 2012.
Model-based approaches, consistent with CGER and other approaches, suggest that Australia’s real
exchange rate is 10-20 percent above the level predicted by Australia-specific factors from a mediumterm perspective. These estimates are, however, subject to considerable uncertainty. The IMF’s
amended real exchange rate regression approach attempts to identify the policy-related (both domestic
and international) drivers of the deviation of each country’s real exchange rate from its fundamentalsbased fitted value. Applied to Australia, this yields an estimate of 20 percent overvaluation.

Staff projects the current account to widen to 6 percent in the medium term, as the investment boom
continues and the terms of trade and interest rates on external borrowing normalize (text figures).
Investment is projected to peak at 29 percent of GDP in 2015 from 27 percent in 2011, and then to fall
back to 28 percent of GDP in 2017. Over the same period, saving is projected to decline gradually from
25 to 22½ percent of GDP reflecting projected declines in currently high private sector corporate and
household savings rates. If government saving does not follow its projected path of rising by 3 percent
of GDP, the current account deficit would be correspondingly larger. The terms of trade is projected to
decline by 15 percent between 2011 and 2017, and the riskless real interest rate is assumed to return to
the pre-crisis average.
Staff assesses that the underlying current account deficit is 2 percent of GDP larger than the estimated
medium-term norm of a deficit of 4 percent of GDP. The latter is close to the 4¼ percent of GDP
average of the current account deficit since 1988, and is derived from a cross-country regression with a
fixed effect.
Staff’s assessment is sensitive to projections of saving behavior as well as the nature of the investment
boom. Private saving may fall less quickly than projected if Australia’s terms of trade falls more slowly
(yielding higher retained profits), or if the deleveraging process is deeper than expected (pushing up
household and corporate saving). The volume and timing of exports yielded by mining investments also
affects the assessment.

relative to what might have been expected given the recent decline in the terms of trade. They
noted, however, that there have been times in the past where the exchange rate has not moved
closely in line with the terms of trade on a short term basis and that the recent strength of the
exchange rate reflected positively on the relative attractiveness of Australia as an investment
destination at the current juncture.

FACILITATING STRUCTURAL CHANGE
34.

Structural change. A key structural policy challenge is to facilitate the movement of

resources across the economy, as the mining sector moves rapidly through various stages from a
phase of rapid commodity price growth to a period—currently underway and expected to peak in
the next few years—of large scale investment, and to rapid growth in exports as investment projects
are completed. Commodity prices have likely peaked, and although expected to remain at high
levels, will no longer serve as a key driver of income growth. Strong demand from ongoing
urbanization and industrialization in emerging Asia is fueling a surge in resources sector investment,
which is projected to reach historic highs as a percent of GDP over the next two years. Ultimately,
this investment will boost Australia’s export capacity as projects come online.
35.

Commodity price shocks. The increasing share of the mining sector in the economy implies

that Australia will be more exposed to volatile commodity prices. Policies will also face the challenge
of facilitating adjustment to shocks that affect different industries and regions within the country.
Part of the adjustment to these asymmetric shocks can take place through the redistribution of
income and taxation across regions achieved by Australia’s federal fiscal system already in place. Our
tentative estimates suggest that Australia’s existing fiscal policy framework provides a fair amount of
income insurance of this kind (Box 4).
36.

Diversifying growth. Staff welcomed the government’s efforts to formulate a policy

strategy for dealing with the economy’s longer-term structural transition, in particular making the
most of the opportunities offered by the growth of Asian economies and addressing related
challenges, as outlined in the recently released government White Paper on Australia in the Asian
Century. To benefit from the Asian Century, Australia needs more than a mining sector success, not
least to ensure that the economy has diversified enough growth drivers, such as services exports,
health, education, tourism and professional services.6

6

Staff organized a conference jointly with the Treasury and the RBA during the mission, in which the challenges and
opportunities Australia faces in the Asian Century were extensively discussed.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

AUSTRALIA

Box 4. Federal Taxes and Transfers as Insurance for States in Australia
The Federal Fiscal System of Australia provides important insurance to households against idiosyncratic
income shocks at the state level. Federal taxes change automatically in a countercyclical way with the
level of income of households, providing insurance against negative shocks. Something similar
happens with federal transfers.
Since states lack their own exchange rate, the insurance provided is particularly helpful to
accommodate regional shocks. The shocks can be state specific, like natural disasters, or industry
specific, like the mining boom, which affects states in an asymmetric way. The insurance provided by
the federal fiscal system can be seen as the counterpart of the absent exchange rate flexibility for the
states to react to shocks.
Staff estimates that about a quarter of the income lost in households is compensated by this insurance.
The estimates are based on regression analysis of taxes and transfers paid or received by households
as a function of income over the last two decades. Variables are measured in real per capita terms and
relative to the national average. Several specifications produced similar results. Four fifths of the
insurance comes from the tax side. These estimates are comparable to those for other countries, which
vary between one tenth and one third for the total insurance effect.
Federal taxes decrease by approximately twenty cents per dollar lost in income. This is the combined
effect of federal taxes on income, wealth, and other taxes when income in one state falls with respect
to the national average. It includes all federal taxation on individuals. It excludes company taxes since
the focus of the study is on the disposable income of households, not the support to the full economy.
Federal transfers increase by approximately five cents per dollar lost in income. The fact that transfers
seem to provide less insurance than taxes could reflect non linearity in the amount received when
compared to income, like receiving benefits only by belonging to groups defined by thresholds or
other characteristics, for example, unemployment benefits that don’t change when income is lower for
the employed, transfers to families below certain income or belonging to a disadvantaged group like
the disabled.
It is important to notice that this analysis aims to capture the countercyclical effect on income and not
re-distributive policy. The previous discussion about the role of transfers makes clear that one thing is
the stabilizing effect on income and the other redistribution to the poor or other disadvantaged
groups in society.
The federal system also provides additional insurance to the state finances. The estimates above relate
only to disposable household income, and do not include horizontal transfers between states and
vertical transfers with the federal government. Of particular importance for state finances is the
horizontal fiscal equalization mechanism by which goods and services sales tax revenues are redistributed among states.
The total insurance to household incomes is larger than our estimates above, because of state taxes
and transfers. The focus of the study was the federal system, as a counterpart to the absence of a
floating exchange rate at the state level. The state fiscal system also provides some automatic
stabilization of household income.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

AUSTRALIA

The Authorities’ Views
37.

Managing structural change. The authorities agreed that Australia is undergoing long-

term structural change, shifting towards a services-oriented economy and responding to the rise of
Asia, as reflected in current demand for non-rural commodities and the needs of the growing Asian
middle class. The government’s role is to facilitate change, which is best achieved through policies
that increase the flexibility, capabilities, and stability of the economy. They emphasized the key role
of exchange rate flexibility in adjusting to cycles in the terms of trade. They noted that although the
current mining boom is larger than in the past, macroeconomic outcomes are better, with stable
inflation and low unemployment. This can be, in part, explained by improvements to the institutional
settings such as the introduction of a floating exchange rate regime, decentralized wage bargaining,
inflation targeting and operational independence for the RBA, and product market reforms that
enhance flexibility, such as removal of trade barriers. The authorities noted that as the investment
phase of the current boom winds down, growth in other sectors of the economy such as residential
construction would need to pick-up in order to maintain a steady pace of economic growth. They
noted that early signs of this were already starting to occur, assisted by the significant monetary
policy easing over the past year.

STAFF APPRAISAL
38.

Outlook and risks. The outlook for the Australian economy remains favorable with strong

commodity demand from China that is boosting export earnings and driving an investment boom in
the mining sector. Outside the mining sector, growth is expected to be slow with still weak
consumer confidence and a strong exchange rate weighing on business investment. The risks to the
growth projections are tilted to the downside reflecting an uncertain global economy and the risk of
disruptions to the global financial system. The flexible exchange rate would provide a buffer against
shocks, particularly to fluctuations in global commodity demand.
39.

Monetary Policy. The current accommodative monetary policy stance is broadly

appropriate given expected inflation within the target range, the strong Australian dollar, and efforts
to return the budget to surplus this year. The RBA’s high degree of credibility and the rapid
monetary policy transmission in Australia allows monetary policy to react quickly and flexibly to
changing economic circumstances. If the global recovery stalls or international markets are
disrupted, monetary policy should act as the first line of defense and the RBA has the scope to cut
the policy rate and provide liquidity support for banks.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

AUSTRALIA

40.

Fiscal Policy. The government’s deficit reduction path strikes a balance between the benefit

of reducing public debt and the need to contain any adverse impact on economic growth. Much of
this year’s adjustment reflects a catch up of revenue, which should help mitigate the impact of the
planned deficit reduction on aggregate demand. The plan to maintain surpluses over the medium
term should help relieve pressure on monetary policy and thereby the exchange rate, and put
Australia in a better position to deal with future shocks and the long-term cost of aging. Australia’s
modest public debt gives the authorities scope to delay their planned return to surpluses in the
event of a sharp deterioration in the economic outlook.
41.

External vulnerabilities and the exchange rate. Australia’s net foreign liabilities are large

by international comparison. The current account deficit is projected to widen in the coming years
as mining-related capital goods imports, mostly financed by direct investment, pick up. Although a
strong Australian dollar plays a necessary role in reallocating resources toward mining and related
sectors, it is stronger than would be consistent with this adjustment alone, and at its current level
would likely lead to a build-up of bank foreign liabilities over the longer term. Increasing national
saving, including through budget deficit reduction, would help reduce pressure on the current
account.
42.

Financial Sector. An FSAP Update was conducted in conjunction with the 2012 Article IV

consultation and found Australia’s financial system to be sound, resilient, and well-managed. Banks
are making efforts to move to more stable funding sources and are hedged against exchange rate
risk, but will continue to rely on wholesale funding for the foreseeable future exposing them to
global market turmoil. Stress testing indicates that the major banks are adequately capitalized and
are likely to withstand large macroeconomic shocks, but would require RBA liquidity support to
withstand an extreme funding shock. The authorities should continue to emphasize intensive bank
supervision and introduce higher loss absorbency for systematically important banks.
43.

Facilitating structural change. A key structural policy challenge is to facilitate the

movement of resources across the economy, as the mining sector moves through various stages:
namely, a commodity price boom, the current large scale investment phase, and then the expected
expansion in export capacity. Staff welcomed the government’s efforts to formulate a policy strategy
for dealing with the economy’s longer-term structural transition, in particular making the most of
the opportunities offered by the growth of Asian economies and addressing related challenges.
44.

Staff recommends that the next article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-

month cycle.

The main direct impact would be through financial sector

Moreover, declining export demand would reduce GDP growth.
A sustained decline in GDP growth, together with a rise in
unemployment, could exacerbate financial stresses in the
banking sector.
Medium
A significant fall in commodity prices would weaken Australia’s
terms of trade. The free-floating exchange rate would help buffer
the impact on the economy, as declines in commodity prices can
be offset to some extent by a weakening of the Australian dollar.

prices

Low

High
One-third of Australia’s exports go to emerging Asia, leaving
growth prospects vulnerable to their economic outlook.
Low
Banks’ reliance on wholesale and external funding remains high.
Their foreign liability positions are largely hedged and the
explicit liquidity support from the RBA means that a reversal of
capital flows would unlikely result in forced asset sales.
Nevertheless, volatility in international funding markets could
raise banks’ funding costs.
Medium
House prices have declined gradually over the past year, but a
collapse in house prices appears unlikely. A major construction
boom has not accompanied the run-up in house prices, and
supply remains quite tight in some areas. An average LTV ratio of
around 50 percent on outstanding owner-occupied mortgages
provides a buffer for the financial sector against a large decline
in house prices. Nonetheless, there would likely be a negative
wealth effect on consumption.
Commercial real estate prices have seen a large correction since
2008 but still appear high in international comparison.
Commercial real estate represents about 10 percent of banks’
exposures, and a sharp fall in prices would likely impair banks’
balance sheets.

Appendix II. Australia: Main Recommendations of the 2011 Article IV Consultation

Fund Recommendations
Fiscal policy: Staff welcomed the authorities’
commitment to return to a budget surplus by
2012/13, despite the negative impact of natural
disasters. The deficit reduction should put Australia
in a strong position to deal with future shocks. Staff
noted that there was ample scope to slow the pace
of exit or loosen fiscal policy in response to a
downside scenario.
Staff emphasized that the automatic fiscal stabilizers
should be allowed to operate fully, given that the
growing dependence on mining may amplify the
business cycle.

Policy Actions
The 2011/12 underlying cash deficit came in larger
than planned. However, the authorities remain
committed to returning to a budget surplus by
2012/13. Beyond that, the authorities plan to
improve the fiscal position by limiting real
spending growth to 2 per cent a year, on average,
until surpluses are at least 1 per cent of GDP.
The government’s strategy of achieving budget
surpluses, on average, over the medium term and
improving the government’s net financial worth is
consistent with allowing the automatic stabilizers
to operate.

Monetary policy: Staff agreed with the monetary
policy stance, which has helped anchor medium-term
inflation expectations. Staff advised that if the
recovery remains on track, further increases in the
policy rate are likely to be needed to contain inflation
pressures from the impact of the mining boom on
the wider economy. However, if global financial
markets become severely disrupted or world growth
falters, Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has ample
space to cut the policy rate.

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has lowered
the policy rate by 150 basis points since November
2011, with the most recent cut in October 2012.
Initially, when inflation moderated at the end 2011,
the RBA moved to remove a mildly restrictive
monetary policy stance. During 2012, as the
outlook for the global economy deteriorated
accompanied by a slightly weaker domestic
outlook for 2013, and with projected inflation
consistent with the target, the RBA shifted to an
accommodative monetary policy stance.

Financial sector policy: Staff emphasized the
importance of continued intensive bank supervision
to maintain financial stability. Staff also
recommended considering the merits of higher
capital requirements for the systematically important
domestic banks and encouraging banks to reduce
further their short-term external borrowing.

The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority
(APRA) undertook comprehensive stress tests of
banks. With respect to capital requirements, the
authorities will consider the next steps on higher
loss absorbency following the G-20 endorsement
of Basel recommendations for Domestic
Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
November 12, 2012

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Australia
On November 12, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Australia.1
Background
The Australian economy has been growing faster than most advanced countries, benefiting
from its trade linkages with Asia, particularly China. Growth accelerated from 2¾ percent in
the second half of 2011 to 4 percent in the first half of 2012, driven by private domestic
demand and exports. However, growth has been uneven with mining-related sectors
expanding strongly, in contrast with below-trend growth in other sectors. The high
Australian dollar is weighing on trade-exposed manufacturing and tourism, which along
with the uncertain global economic outlook is contributing to a broadly pessimistic mood,
and weak investment growth outside the mining sector. Although survey measures of
consumer and business sentiment remained below their long-run averages, household
consumption grew in line with solid household income growth.
Australia’s terms of trade peaked in 2011, pushing up the real effective exchange rate
further and narrowing the current account deficit to 2¼ percent of GDP. By the second
quarter of 2012, the terms of trade had fallen by around 10 percent, driven by declines in
spot prices for iron ore and coking coal of 25 and 30 percent respectively. In recent
months, however, the Australian dollar has remained high despite lower export commodity
prices and the weaker global outlook, in part related to portfolio reallocations of large
reserve holders toward Australian government debt.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
CPI inflation has eased with underlying measures of inflation remaining near the middle of
the 2-3 percent target band, largely due to the declining tradable goods prices associated
with the appreciation of the exchange rate. Wage growth is also moderate, just marginally
above its 10 year average in June 2012 with private sector wage growth faster than in the
public sector. The labor market has performed well in international comparison, with a low
unemployment rate at below 5½ percent.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has lowered the policy rate by 150 basis points since
November 2011, with the most recent cut in October 2012. Initially, when inflation
moderated at the end 2011, the RBA moved to remove a mildly restrictive monetary policy
stance. During 2012, as the outlook for the global economy deteriorated accompanied by a
slightly weaker domestic outlook for 2013, and with projected inflation consistent with the
target, the RBA shifted to an accommodative monetary policy stance. Interest rates for
borrowers, a key indicator of the overall stance, are now slightly below their medium-term
averages.
The 2011/12 underlying cash deficit came in at 3 percent of GDP, about 1½ percentage
points higher than forecast during the 2011-12 Budget, due to both weaker receipts and
higher expenditure. Structural factors have kept receipts as a percent of GDP below precrisis levels and have also contributed to receipts falling short of projections by 0.9 percent
of GDP during 2011/12. High levels of mining sector investment and associated
depreciation deductions have dampened growth in mining company tax receipts relative to
profit growth. Changing consumer spending patterns away from the retail sector towards
services have lowered retail company tax receipts. Furthermore, lower house and equity
price growth rates, especially compared with pre-crisis rates, lowered capital gains tax
receipts. Payments during 2011/12 exceeded forecasts by 0.6 percent of GDP mainly due
to payments related to natural disasters and the accelerated transfer payments to
households and businesses as compensation for higher energy costs following the
introduction of carbon price.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Australian authorities for their sound and prudent
macroeconomic management, which had contributed to impressive growth, low
unemployment, and subdued inflation. They noted that the economic outlook remains
favorable, although risks are tilted to the downside, including a possible deterioration in
external demand and elevated stress in the global financial market. Directors underscored
the need to preserve adequate policy space to respond to adverse shocks and to
persevere with structural adjustments aimed at facilitating more balanced growth.
Directors agreed that the current accommodative monetary stance is broadly appropriate.
They also concurred that there is scope for further easing if warranted by economic
circumstances. Policy effectiveness is supported by the central bank’s high degree of
credibility and a well-functioning transmission mechanism.
Directors supported the government’s consolidation plans, which allow a reduction in public
indebtedness without prejudice to growth through a combination of spending restraint and
reprioritization, tax measures, as well as use of proceeds from mineral resources. They
welcomed the intention to maintain budgetary surpluses over the medium term, thus
strengthening fiscal buffers against future shocks and the long-term cost of population

3
aging. Directors noted nevertheless that, in the event of a sharp deterioration in the
economic outlook, and hence revenue underperformance, delaying the return to surpluses
could be an option, given Australia’s modest debt-to-GDP ratio. Allowing automatic
stabilizers to operate fully could also help relieve pressure on monetary policy.
Directors noted that Australia’s flexible exchange rate is a critically important element of the
macroeconomic policy framework. They observed, however, that the Australian dollar,
which remains moderately above its long-term average, has exerted pressure on
non-mining tradable sectors, widening the current account deficit and net foreign liabilities.
Raising national saving, including through budget deficit reduction and further incremental
increases in employer provided pension contributions, would help narrow the current
account deficit over time.
Directors welcomed the FSAP Update, which found Australia’s financial system to be
sound, resilient, and well managed. They underscored the importance of continuing
intensive bank supervision, providing liquidity support, and ensuring that systemically
important banks have adequate capital buffers. Directors welcomed progress in increasing
the competitiveness of the banking system, and encouraged further steps aimed at
reducing banks’ short-term wholesale debt and broadening domestic funding sources.
Close monitoring of developments in the housing market and household debt levels should
continue to be priorities in the oversight of the financial sector.
Directors commended the government’s efforts to facilitate a structural transition toward a
services-oriented economy. More specifically, they encouraged Australia to seize the
opportunities offered by the growth of Asian economies, including by enhancing
productivity and flexibility in the product and labor markets. They welcomed the
government’s White Paper on Australia in the Asian Century, laying out a strategy for
actively engaging with the region.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Ian Davidoff, Alternate Executive Director for Australia
and Nghi Luu, Senior Advisor
November 12, 2012
The Australian economy has continued to grow at trend pace, underpinned by strong economic
fundamentals. In addition to solid growth, unemployment is low, inflation is contained and stable,
monetary policy has room to ease further, and public finances are healthy with the budget due to
return to surplus in 2012-13. The financial system is also strong and well-regulated, with our four
major banks amongst the highest rated in the world.
While GDP is forecast to grow around its trend rate over the next two years - driven by strong
growth in resources investment and exports, as well as solid growth in household consumption
- the tepid nature of the global recovery will continue to weigh on Australia’s growth prospects.
In particular, developments in Europe and emerging Asian economies remain the key source of risks
to the Australian economy, along with an unfavorable resolution of the fiscal cliff in the US. My
authorities remain proactive and vigilant to any further deterioration in the world economy, and have
long recognized the importance of preserving adequate policy space to respond to economic
developments.
Australia is now entering the next phase of the mining boom, where the period of high
commodity prices is likely to have passed, and mining investment reaches its peak. Whereas
investment in iron ore and coal extraction has dominated recent resources investment, petroleum and
LNG will dominate investment in the years to come. The investment pipeline for LNG is substantial,
with many investment projects already committed or underway. The investment phase of the mining
boom, which is likely to peak over the next two years, is expected to be followed by a production and
export boom. The terms of trade will decline this year, due to recent falls in iron ore and coal prices,
but remain elevated and high by historical standards owing to the ongoing process of urbanization
and industrializing of the fast-growing Asian economies.
Australia will need to develop new sources of growth and the economy will continue to evolve
in response to structural changes prompted by the re-emergence of Asia. As the middle-income
class continues to grow rapidly in Asia, it will increasingly demand a diverse range of goods and
services, from health and aged care, to education and financial services, as well as high-quality food
products. My authorities are focused on lifting productivity and improving engagement in Asia, in
order to seize and manage the growth opportunities presented by these changes.
Fiscal Policy
My authorities are committed to maintaining strict fiscal discipline through the medium-term fiscal
strategy, which has remained unchanged since 2008-09. The recent release of the Mid-Year
Economic and Fiscal Outlook shows that net debt peaked at 10 per cent of GDP in 2011-12 and that
the budget is on track to return to a small surplus in 2012-13, followed by increasingly larger
surpluses.

2
A return to surplus has been made more difficult with a weaker global economic outlook and falls in
global commodity prices, underpinning a downward revision to tax receipts (mainly through
company tax receipts and resources rent taxes). As noted by Staff, a range of other factors have also
limited tax receipts, including reduced company tax collections due to depreciation deductions
associated with mining sector investment, and lower capital gains tax receipts due to relatively
subdued growth in housing and equity prices.
Notwithstanding these challenges, the forecast return to surplus will be achieved through a
combination of natural increases in the tax receipts associated with a growing economy, as well as
continued spending restraint, with government spending as a share of the economy remaining at 30year historical lows (below 24 per cent of GDP). Due to the nature and timing of the savings
measures put in place – for example, a delay in increases in overseas development assistance – the
contractionary impact of the fiscal strategy is expected to be significantly lower (¾ to 1½ per cent of
GDP) than the 3.1 per cent of GDP turnaround in the underlying cash balance.
Consistent with their commitment to retaining policy space, my authorities’ judge that a return to
surplus is appropriate given current economic conditions and other policy settings. The Australian
economy is forecast to grow around trend (factoring in the planned fiscal contraction), with low
unemployment, a low and stable inflation rate, scope for monetary policy to be eased and commodity
prices expected to remain elevated. At the same time, my authorities note Staff’s recommendation to
allow the automatic stabilizers to operate, and will continue to judge the appropriate fiscal settings
based on developments in the domestic and international economy.
Monetary Policy
Inflationary pressures remain contained, with both headline and underlying inflation remaining
consistent with the medium term target of 2 to 3 per cent. The headline consumer price index
increased by 1.4 per cent in the September quarter, to be 2 per cent over the year. The quarterly
increase in headline CPI reflects a modest inflationary impact from the introduction of an explicit
carbon price in July this year, as well as a number of seasonal and temporary factors.
Going forward, domestic prices are likely to remain subdued with the continuation of the recent
increase in productivity growth and slower growth in wages. The high exchange rate, however, is
expected to have less of a disinflationary impact than in the recent past due to the diminishing effects
of the earlier appreciation in the Australian dollar.
Over the past year, monetary policy has become more accommodative, with the official interest rate
lowered by 150 basis points to 3.25 per cent. This rate is near its recent historic low but still well
clear of the zero bound. Interest rates for borrowers have declined to be clearly below their mediumterm averages. Many households have taken advantage of the lower rates to pre-pay mortgage debt,
rather than increase their consumption expenditure.

3
Exchange rate and external stability
The Australian dollar has stayed above its long-term average for an extended period of time,
remaining near or above parity against the US dollar since October 2010. The relative strength of the
Australian economy has increased the risk-adjusted return on Australian assets in relative terms,
boosting global investors’ demand (including central banks’) for a range of Australian dollar
denominated assets. The value of the currency has also been boosted by cyclical influences that are
reflected in wide interest rate differentials between Australia and most other advanced economies.
The current account deficit (CAD) is expected to widen over the next two years, largely reflecting a
fall in the terms of trade and an increase in capital imports. From a net lending perspective, the key
driver of the rising current account deficit is the inflow of capital needed to finance the surge in
resources investment, with the household sector and the Australian Government expected to be net
lenders. This, together with the high level of foreign ownership of the resource sector, means that the
current account is being largely funded by foreign investors. In the past, Australia’s banking sector
has intermediated much of the foreign borrowing associated with the CAD. However, in recent years
resources investment has largely been internally funded out of the cashflow of investors. As
resources investment is expected to drive the increase in Australia’s capital requirements in the
period ahead, we expect bank intermediation of the CAD to continue to decline.
My authorities remain committed to a floating exchange rate, given the benefits Australia has derived
from having a flexible exchange rate regime. Notwithstanding the fact that movements in the
Australian dollar have not mirrored the recent moderate decline in the terms of trade, the exchange
rate has played a pivotal role in dampening the impact of economic shocks (including in 2009), and
along with inflation-targeting monetary policy, has delivered macroeconomic stability over the past
two decades.
The strength of the Australian dollar is inevitably exerting pressure on a number of non-mining trade
exposed sectors, such as manufacturing and tourism. The structural change is resulting in a
reallocation of resources across regions and sectors of the economy and improving productivity by
moving resources to areas where their value is greatest. Notably, this recent wave of structural
change has resulted in smaller variations in the labor market across the country compared with
similar shocks in the past, reflecting the more flexible nature of Australia’s product and labor
markets.
Financial Sector and Household Balance Sheet
Significant steps have been taken in recent years to increase the competitiveness of the banking
system and to ensure that the Australian financial system remains strong and secure. Banks are
adapting to a slower credit growth environment but remain conservative in their lending practices.
The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) continues to take a proactive, risk-based
approached to supervising its banks.

4
Australian banks continue to use offshore wholesale funding. However, banks have increased the
liquidity of their balance sheets and have moved to a more stable funding structure by reducing their
use of short term wholesale debt (from 33 to 18 per cent of all funding over the last four years) and
replacing it with deposits and longer term wholesale debt.
While we acknowledge that the combination of high household debt and elevated house prices is a
risk to banks’ large mortgage portfolio and the economy more broadly, this risk is mitigated by a
range of factors (as is noted in the FSAP). Households are in a significant net asset position, the
average loan-to-valuation ratio is relatively low at 50 per cent, and mortgages with loan-to-valuation
ratios above 80 per cent (about one-quarter of the total stock) are typically covered by lenders’
mortgage insurance. Furthermore, most households are well ahead of their scheduled mortgage
repayments (on average equivalent to 18 months of scheduled repayments), providing a significant
buffer to draw down on during times of stress. Mortgages are full recourse loans, giving borrowers
an incentive to continue making payment even under stress.
Financial Sector Assessment Program
My authorities agree with the FSAP assessment that our financial sector is sound, resilient and well
managed and welcome the broad recommendations from the FSAP. Australia places a high priority
on maintaining its track record of prudent economic management and strong supervision of the
financial sector.
As the assessment notes, Australia’s financial regulation framework has a high level of compliance
with international standards, underpinned by strong systemic oversight, a sound crisis management
framework and effective policy coordination arrangements. Our experience during the financial crisis
has demonstrated the strength of our system, and stress testing by the IMF and APRA shows that our
banking system is capable of withstanding severe shocks. As noted by Staff, Australia is also well on
track to implement the Basel III capital and liquidity reforms.
My authorities would like to express their gratitude and appreciation to the assessment team, for their
hard work, dedication and engagement with Australia and our FSAP team. They welcome the
opportunity to address the IMF’s recommendations, to strengthen our system where appropriate.
Structural Reform
The rise of emerging Asia and the shift in global economic weight towards Australia’s region poses a
defining challenge for Australia in managing and facilitating structural change. Australia has a good
track record of managing structural adjustments, yet the scale of change and opportunities presented
by the Asian century is unprecedented. A whole-of-Australia effort is required to manage the
adjustment.
My authorities are aware that policy settings must be appropriately calibrated to not only ensure that
we are well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities that lie in our region, but to ensure that
the benefits are widely dispersed amongst the community.

5
Australia’s success in the Asian century will be supported by lifting productivity through ongoing
reform. Continued increases in productivity will ensure Australia can successfully meet Asia’s
demand for goods and services beyond mineral resources, by ultimately improving the flexibility of
the Australian economy and therefore its ability to adjust to compositional change. Accordingly, my
authorities are pursuing reforms and investments across five areas – skills and education, innovation,
infrastructure (including telecommunications infrastructure), tax reform and regulatory reform.
The recent release of the Government’s White Paper on Australia in the Asian Century builds on
these steps and sets out an ambitious blueprint for Australia’s navigation of the Asian century. It
provides a comprehensive review of economic and strategic change in Asia and its implications for
Australia. The White Paper assesses Australia’s current policy settings and commits Australia to
improve the way it understands and engages with the region. The approach includes improving
language literacy, adapting business models so that they are better suited to the region, and
continuing to attract highly skilled and talented people to live, study and work in Australia.
This strategy should help Australia to strengthen its platform for growth and secure its ongoing
prosperity.
