Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representative for the 2006 Consultation with Gabon
Approved by David Nellor and Adrienne Cheasty
May 17, 2006
•

Discussions on the 2006 Article IV consultation were held in Libreville during
February 25–March 9, 2006. The mission team comprised Messrs. Nord (head),
Melhado, Olters (all AFR), Op de Beke (PDR), Leigh (FAD), and Randriamaholy
(Resident Representative). Mr. Nguema-Affane (OED) attended most meetings.
The mission worked closely with the World Bank and the African Development
Bank on forestry issues, private-sector development, and the Growth and Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (GPRSP).

•

The mission met with Prime Minister Eyeghé Ndong, Finance Minister Toungui,
Planning Minister Oyé Mba, the BEAC National Director Andzembé, other senior
officials, and key representatives of the Senate, the National Assembly, the private
sector and the donor community. At mission’s end, staff left the authorities with a
concluding statement and issued a press statement.

•

In concluding the 2005 Article IV consultation, Executive Directors commended
the Gabonese authorities for the progress in macroeconomic stabilization and the
successful initiation of structural reforms, but underscored that a vigorous
implementation of the structural reform agenda is essential to stimulate private
sector-led non-oil growth and accelerate economic diversification. Directors
attached particular importance to reinforcing governance and transparency,
developing micro-finance institutions, and making progress in the privatization
program. Directors also saw scope to strengthen the legal and regulatory
framework, especially its consistent application.

•

Gabon has subscribed to the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). Data
provision for surveillance purposes is adequate overall, albeit with some room for
improvement in the quality, timeliness, and public availability of statistical data.

•

Gabon has accepted the obligations of Article VIII and maintains an exchange
system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions.

KEY ISSUES FOR DISCUSSION
In 2005, Gabon continued to enjoy record high oil prices, buoying both exports and
government revenues. Benefiting from high prices for other primary commodities, and the
macroeconomic discipline established in the context of the 2004–05 Stand-By Arrangement,
non-oil growth also accelerated while inflation remained moderate, resulting in the first
increase in per-capita GDP since 1999. The elimination of external and domestic arrears and
the lowering of external debt provided a welcome boost to confidence, complementing the
far-reaching structural reforms initiated since 2004. However, the elections in late-2005 were
accompanied by large fiscal slippages and delays in structural reforms. Gabon now stands at
a critical juncture. The anticipated depletion of oil reserves requires decisive action to place
economic policies on a sustainable basis. The challenge is to seize the opportunity to
decisively lower debt levels, thereby reducing Gabon’s historical vulnerability to oil price
swings, while also addressing the country’s pressing social and infrastructural needs.
How do Directors assess the choice facing the Gabonese authorities between saving or
spending part of the oil windfall?
Do Directors agree with staff that the anticipated depletion of Gabon’s oil reserves over the
next 30 years requires a sharp fiscal adjustment, i.e. a substantial increase in public savings?
Do Directors agree that to reestablish credibility after the end-2005 slippages and reduce
Gabon’s vulnerability to oil price swings the bulk of the fiscal adjustment should be frontloaded? Do Directors agree that debt and reserve management take on additional importance
to optimize the use of government savings?
How do Directors assess the challenge of managing the transition from oil-dependence to
a more diversified economic structure?
Do Directors agree with staff that public financial management, including oil revenue
management, needs significant strengthening to raise the quality of public spending? Do
Directors agree that a significant structural reform agenda remains, notably to improve the
business climate and foster private sector-led growth?
How do Directors assess the need for more transparency to bolster accountability and good
governance?
Do Directors agree with staff that significant scope remains to increase oil revenue
transparency, including under the EITI? Do Directors agree that improving access to regular
and accurate information can play an important role in strengthening accountability and
creating a better business climate?

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Gabon has a history of boom-and-bust cycles. Over the last three decades, oil
booms and political cycles resulted in a ratcheting up of public expenditure, followed by
painful adjustment periods when oil prices fell. After rapid economic growth in the 1960s
and 1970s, making Gabon one of the wealthiest countries in Africa, per capita GDP has
stagnated over the past 25 years. And despite its income level, Gabon’s social indicators
remain poor and its infrastructure, for the most part, underdeveloped and ill-maintained.1

The authorities’ economic program, supported by a 14-month Stand-By
Arrangement during 2004–05, represented a break from past practices. During the past
decade, Gabon embarked on several Fund-supported programs but their implementation was
mixed.2 The 2004–05 SBA, which expired in July 2005, was more successful: all
performance criteria were met and all reviews were completed. The program restored
macroeconomic stability, rescheduled or eliminated most external and domestic payment
arrears, and
introduced farGabon: Boom-and-Bust Cycles, 1990-2005

A recent comprehensive poverty survey defined a poverty line at about 14 percent of average

See Box 1 in the 2005 Article IV consultation staff report (Country Report 05/149).

The Development Policy Loan of US$15 million, complemented by a US$10 million grant from the
Global Environment Facility Trust Fund, aims at strengthening the management of natural resources
in Gabon by reinforcing the policy and institutional framework for the management of natural
resources in the forestry, fisheries, and mining sectors, notably by reinforcing governance and
transparency (World Bank Reports No. 33786-GA of 10/19/05 and 34714-GA of 3/6/06).

3.
However, the second half of 2005 was marked by fiscal slippages and a loss of
momentum in the structural reform process. The 2006 Article IV consultation discussions
examined the causes for these slippages and reviewed the government’s economic policies
going forward with the objective of restoring macroeconomic stability and resuming growthenhancing structural reforms.
A. Recent Economic Developments
4.
In 2005, economic growth accelerated and inflation remained low. Real GDP
grew by 3 percent in 2005, led by stronger non-oil growth of 4½ percent notably in timber
processing, manganese production, and the services sector. High oil prices continued to
stimulate investment and exploration, keeping oil production slightly lower at 13¼ million
tons. Meanwhile, consumer price inflation was close to zero and per-capita GDP rose for the
first time in five years.4 The real effective exchange rate depreciated by about 5¼ percent,
reflecting primarily the weakening of the euro to which’s Gabon’s currency is pegged, and
Gabon’s price competitiveness remained broadly unchanged in 2005. (Figure 1).5
5.
Continued buoyant international oil prices led to further large balance of
payments and fiscal surpluses. The average export price of Gabonese crude oil rose by
41 percent in 2005 to US$49 per barrel.6 As a result, the overall balance of payments surplus
rose by 5½ percentage points to 16 percent of GDP in 2005, allowing a further reduction in
external debt to 39 percent of GDP at end-2005. Public savings rose by less and, with the
government saving about half of the oil revenue windfalls, the overall fiscal surplus reached
9¾ percent of GDP. (Box 1).
6.
The presidential elections in late 2005 were accompanied by large fiscal
slippages. The non-oil primary deficit reached 12 percent of non-oil GDP, compared with a
target of 8½ percent in the government’s supplementary budget. The bulk of the slippages
reflected additional non-interest current expenditure, which exceeded the indicative target by
4 percent of non-oil GDP. In addition, non-oil revenue fell short of the indicative target by
about 1½ percentage points of non-oil GDP reflecting, in particular, lower recovery of tax
arrears and a larger impact of personal income tax exemptions than originally anticipated.

4

However, consumer price inflation may be moderately underestimated as the consumption basket,
established in 1975, largely excludes non-tradables, where inflation is likely to have been somewhat
higher. A revision of the index is under way.

6

See Competitiveness and Growth in Gabon—Selected Issues (Country Report 05/147).

Gabon’s oil exports are predominantly light crude. On average in 2005, Gabon’s oil traded at a
discount of US$5 per barrel relative to its Brent benchmark.

Box 1. Use of Additional Oil Resources
The public and private sectors in Gabon saved the bulk of the additional oil GDP that resulted from the
sharp increases in prices during 2003–05. Average oil GDP in 2003–05 increased by 14½ percentage points
of non-oil GDP relative to 2002. Tight fiscal policy in 2003–04 and a contraction in private-sector spending by
9 percentage points of non-oil GDP resulted in imports rising at a slower pace than the additional income. Net
exports increased by 162 percent of additional oil GDP.

The election-related slippages notwithstanding, the government still saved about one-half of additional oil
revenues in 2005. Against the backdrop of export prices increasing by 41 percent, oil revenues—with stagnant
production—rose by 44 percent (CFAF 279 billion). Of that amount, the government spent a total of CFAF
140 billion, i.e., 50.3 percent of additional oil revenue.

7.
The structural reform agenda stalled in the second half of 2005. In particular, the
restructuring and privatization of Air Gabon and Gabon Télécom experienced significant
delays.7 After a strong start in 2004, delays also continued to plague the reform of the
forestry sector.8 Notably, sizeable tax arrears persist, with collection of the area tax reaching
only 22 percent of the target in 2005 and total forestry tax arrears of nearly CFAF 15 billion
at end-2005. However, transparency in the natural resources sector was boosted by the
publication of Gabon’s first report under the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative in
December 2005 (Box 2).
Box 2. Oil Revenue Transparency
Careful monitoring and proper accounting are critical to ensuring that the government receives all
oil revenue it is owed and that those revenues are reported in the budget. Gabon joined the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) to bolster the credibility of its oil revenue collection efforts and
published its first EITI report for 2004 in December 2005 (www.finances.gouv.ga/eiti.htm). The core of
the EITI report was prepared by an international accounting firm hired as independent administrator (IA)
of the EITI process.
The EITI report compares 2004 payments reported by companies with receipts reported by the
government. It notes a discrepancy of CFAF 17 billion (US$33 million) for the oil revenue streams that
were covered, roughly 5 percent of the total, and the IA finds no evidence of serious anomalies. The
authorities are in the process of examining the reasons for the discrepancy.
The coverage of the first EITI report is incomplete. The IA could not include profit oil – the share of
crude oil accruing to the government under the production sharing arrangements – in the 2004 revenue
streams. Profit oil accounts for about half of government revenue from the oil sector. The main reason
for excluding profit oil cited in the report is the inability of the government to provide a detailed
breakdown for 2004 to the IA. The authorities have declared that the next EITI report will include profit
oil.
Follow-up to the first EITI report has been limited. There has been no attempt to date to explain the
discrepancy between government and company reporting and a planned publicity campaign has not yet
taken place. The 2004 oil revenue reported to the IA by the government exceeds earlier revenue
estimates provided to staff by CFAF 22 billion (US$42 million); the authorities have not yet explained
these differences.

7

A tender for 51 percent of Gabon Télécom was finally launched in early December with the aim of
completing the sale by mid-2006. The government announced the liquidation of Air Gabon in
February 2006 and the creation of a new airline, Air Gabon International, in which Royal Air Maroc
will hold majority stake.
8

Timber is Gabon’s second-largest export after oil. In 2004, the authorities simplified forestry
taxation by reducing the number of taxes from over 20 to 3; disclosed the list of the holders of
forestry permits and imposed a moratorium on the allocation of new licenses; and announced the
elimination of the monopoly of the Société nationale des bois du Gabon (SNBG) on the export of
logs.

- 10 -

B. The Regional Context
8.
Gabon is one of Africa’s major oil producers. With proven reserves of about
2 billion barrels and production in 2005 of 268,000 barrels per day, Gabon ranked third
behind Nigeria and Angola in sub-Saharan Africa (Figure 2). Oil dominates the economy:
in 2005, it accounted for more than 50 percent of GDP, 63 percent of government revenue,
and over 80 percent of total exports. With a relatively small population estimated at about
1.4 million, the exploitation of oil reserves led to rapid increases in per-capita income
in 1960-80, making Gabon one of the few middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
However, per-capita GDP has declined since 1980, partly reflecting the impact of repeated
economic crises. Moreover, socio-economic development has lagged significantly, and
human development indicators—while moderately superior to the other CEMAC countries
and African oil exporters—compare unfavorably with countries at similar income levels
(see table below).

II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
9.
The critical medium-term challenge facing Gabon is managing the transition
from an economy highly dependent on oil to a diversified one that harnesses private
sector initiative and makes decisive progress in poverty reduction. The next few years are
likely to be marked by moderate economic growth and continued large fiscal and balance of
payments surpluses. Against this background, discussions centered on sustainable economic
policies in the context of exhaustible oil reserves, the challenges for fiscal policy and public
expenditure management, and the need for structural reform policies to foster economic
diversification.
A. Sustainable Policies in the Context of Exhaustible Oil Reserves
10.
High oil prices represent both a challenge and an opportunity for Gabon. The
large balance of payments and fiscal surpluses provide an opportunity to lower debt levels
decisively, thereby reducing a major source of Gabon’s past vulnerability to shocks, and
build up savings to smooth consumption for future generations after oil resources are
exhausted. The debt sustainability analysis shows that, assuming continued high oil prices
and a resumption of fiscal restraint, total public debt would fall from 44 percent of GDP at
end-2005 to 23 percent by 2008 and further to 10 percent by 2011 (Appendix IV).
11.
Addressing pressing socio-economic development challenges must be balanced
by maintaining macroeconomic stability and medium-term sustainability. The needs for
infrastructure improvements and strengthened social services are very large and higher
government revenue will allow Gabon to address these needs. At the same time, the mission
underlined the importance of balancing such expenditure pressures with appropriate attention
to the sustainability of public spending and the absorptive capacity of the economy. It
suggested that an appropriate anchor for fiscal policy would be the permanently sustainable
non-oil primary deficit, which it estimated at about 5 percent of non-oil GDP.9 The objective
should be to reach the sustainable level over about three to five years (Box 3). Against the
background of continued price stability within a fixed exchange-rate environment, staff
considers such a fiscal policy stance consistent with overall macroeconomic stability.

9

The medium-term sustainable level of the non-oil primary deficit is a function, inter alia, of the
projected level of oil prices, which have risen further since the consultation discussions. At current
prices, the medium-term sustainable non-oil primary deficit would be about 5½ percent of non-oil
GDP.

priority. The analysis presented in an

formation and differential rates on
sovereign debt and financial assets, where “habits” reflect the notion that consumers become addicted to
the level of consumption enjoyed in previous periods. The following three main conclusions emerge from
the analysis:

(i) The current stance of fiscal policy is not sustainable. The permanently sustainable non-oil primary
deficit, estimated at 5 percent of non-oil GDP, is well below the 2005 level of 12 percent of non-oil
GDP.
(ii) Due to habit formation and the existence of adjustment costs, the optimal policy involves
spreading the bulk of the adjustment over a period of three to five years rather than conducting
the single, abrupt adjustment that standard permanent-income models without habits would
prescribe.
(iii) Given the uncertainty regarding future economic conditions, precautionary motives would
suggest front-loading the fiscal adjustment and targeting a smaller long-run deficit. For
example, a decline in real oil prices to 30 US dollars per barrel would reduce the permanently
sustainable primary deficit to 3¾ percent of non-oil GDP. In addition, the existence of an interest rate
spread between sovereign debt and financial assets creates a further incentive for faster adjustment to
pay off net debt.

12.
The authorities agreed with the need to reduce poverty and prepare Gabon for
the post-oil era, while accepting that medium-term fiscal adjustment is needed to ensure
fiscal sustainability in the face of declining government revenue from oil. In seeking the right
balance between the required speed of fiscal adjustment and achieving their socio-economic
development objectives, the authorities emphasized the urgency to provide a strong basis for
economic growth and employment creation, which in their view would have the greatest
impact on poverty (see text table below). In particular, they pointed to severe infrastructural
bottlenecks in the transportation, health, and education sectors that need to be addressed.
Against that background, they noted that the government’s GPRSP, finalized in early 2006,
rests on four pillars: raising growth as a pre-requisite for poverty reduction; improving
infrastructure; improving access to essential services, including education and health; and
strengthening governance. (Appendix III).

B. Fiscal Policy and Public Expenditure Management
13.
There was agreement that the large slippages in 2005 warranted a substantial
fiscal adjustment. While high international oil prices produce growing fiscal surpluses now,
Gabon’s oil reserves are estimated to be exhausted within about 30 years and there is a need to
put public finances on a permanently-sustainable basis. Moreover, Gabon’s fiscal and external
positions remain very vulnerable to swings in oil prices, suggesting the need for additional
fiscal prudence.
14.
Discussions focused on the pace of fiscal adjustment. The mission recommended
sharply reducing the non-oil primary deficit from 12 percent of non-oil GDP in 2005 to
7¼ percent of non-oil GDP in 2006, arguing notably that most of the fiscal slippage in 2005
was of a one-off nature and, hence, reversible. The authorities preferred a more gradual pace,
especially with parliamentary elections scheduled for November. In particular, the authorities
believed that the target for 2006 should take into account (i) continued temporary subsidies to
Air Gabon during the six-month transition period (paragraph 24); and (ii) additional public
investment in line with expectations among the population generated by the finalization of the
GPRSP and promises of large infrastructure projects made by the authorities in the last quarter
of 2005. The authorities considered appropriate a fiscal framework for 2006–08 that would
result in a non-oil primary deficit of about 9 percent of non-oil GDP in 2006 and a 2008 target
of 6½ percent.10
15.
Irrespective of the speed of adjustment, achieving a sustainable fiscal path will
require decisive action on the expenditure side. In particular, the mission emphasized the
need to regain control of current expenditure by reining in transfers and subsidies. The
successor airline to Air Gabon should be managed on a fully commercial basis, without further
budgetary support. Spending from the security and sovereignty fund, which does not follow
10

The 2006 budget, approved by Parliament in November 2005, was based on a provisional fiscal
framework. In particular, it did not take into account spending related to the GPRSP, which had not yet
been completed at that time. A supplementary budget based on a new fiscal framework is expected to
be approved by Parliament before end-June 2006.

- 16 -

ordinary budgetary procedures, should be kept to a strict minimum. And spending on pensions,
which overshot the 2005 budget allocation by 50 percent, represents a growing threat for
budgetary stability and requires a fundamental reassessment of the capacity of the public
finances to deal with the wave of retirement in the public sector. The mission saw scope for
raising productive public investment, but cautioned that the quality of public investment
needed to be improved if it is to have an lasting impact on economic growth.11
16.
Debt and reserve management take on additional importance in an environment
characterized by ambitious fiscal objectives. Easing the transition to the post-oil era by
saving the bulk of the current windfall revenue over many years requires optimizing the use of
the government’s savings. In the short term, accelerating the reduction in public debt—
including pre-paying external debt owed to Paris Club creditors—is likely to yield significant
benefits by reducing Gabon’s annual interest bill, lowering its vulnerability to future shocks,
and increasing the fiscal space for GPRSP investments. Eliminating the costly bons
d’équipement, on which the government is paying 7½ percent interest, should be an immediate
priority.12 Beyond the short term, it will be important to ensure that Gabon has the ability to
invest its windfall surplus in an optimal manner. This will mean replacing the current Fonds
pour les générations futures (FFG), on which the BEAC currently pays a nominal rate of
1½ percent, by a more effective institutional framework for accumulating long-term financial
assets.
17.
Petroleum price subsidies are a growing burden on public finances. The freeze in
domestic retail prices since 2002 combined with sharp increases in international oil prices has
led to large and growing implicit subsidies, reaching 3¼ percent of non-oil GDP in 2005. At
current oil prices, the cost of the subsidies could rise to 4½ percent of non-oil GDP (Box 4).
Moreover, a Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) carried out by staff in an
accompanying selected issues paper suggests that the bulk of the subsidies accrues to the rich
rather than the poor. The mission proposed that the authorities consider the following options:
(i) reflect both the foregone revenue and the implicit subsidies transparently in the budget;
(ii) gradually raise the ex-refinery prices of petroleum products to import-parity levels with the
objective of eliminating the subsidy over a three-year period; and (iii) offset the impact of
price increases by raising targeted subsidies to the poor and GPRSP spending. The authorities
appreciated the analysis provided by the mission. They noted the importance of transport costs
for the Gabonese economy given the size of the sparsely populated country, but recognized the
rising cost of the subsidies, and are considering options to reduce them.13

11

See Gabon: Assessing the Quality of Public Investment, Gabon: 2006 Article IV Consultation—
Selected Issues (Country Report 06/232).
12

The government should also continue to reduce its outstanding advances from the BEAC, which carry
an interest rate of 5½ percent. A discussion is currently underway at the level of the CEMAC to replace
the advances by tradable Treasury Bills (see forthcoming staff report on the annual discussions with the
CEMAC authorities).
13

On March 15, the retail prices of three petroleum products were increased by 7 percent in response to
a negotiated increase in retailer margins (ex-refinery prices remained unchanged).

- 17 -

Box 4. Implicit Fuel Price Subsidies in Gabon
At the core of the implicit fuel price subsidies in Gabon are the ex-refinery prices of 7 petroleum
products that have been frozen since August 2002. The sole supplier of these products to the domestic
market is the majority-privately-owned refinery SOGARA. The refinery purchases the crude oil required for
its operations at a price that has increased with world crude oil prices. But because domestic fuel prices are
frozen, the refinery sustains a loss when it sells the refined products. To quantify the loss, i.e. the value of
the fuel price subsidy due to the price freeze, a reference import parity price (IPP) is computed every month
by SOGARA based on international market prices, local taxes, costs, fees, and margins. The difference
between the IPP and the frozen ex-refinery price multiplied by the quantity sold equals the monthly loss to
the refinery for which it is compensated fully by the government. Payment is made in the form of crude oil
delivered free of charge to SOGARA. These subsidies are not reported explicitly in the fiscal accounts but
are instead netted against oil revenue, i.e. they are implicit.
The total fiscal cost of the subsidies implied by the ex-refinery price freeze is estimated to have
reached 3.2 percent of non-oil GDP in 2005 and could increase to 4.5 percent in 2006, as compared to
an estimated subsidy cost equivalent to less than 1 percent of annual non-oil GDP in 2003. The bulk of the
cost of the subsidies corresponds to diesel which is used mainly by heavy industry and for transportation.
For comparison, total public spending on health and education comprised 2.2 and 3.1 percent of non-oil
GDP in 2005, respectively. Reflecting the implicit subsidies in the budget would have raised the non-oil
primary deficit from 12 percent to 15¾ percent of non-oil GDP in 2005.
.

The size of the fiscal cost of the fuel price subsidy in Gabon is not unusual for an oil-exporting
country. In Gabon, the cost of the subsidies is likely to have reached 1.6 percent of overall GDP in 2005.
The size of implicit subsidies in eight countries for which data were available are estimated to range from
0.3 percent of GDP (Cameroon) to 9.9 percent (Azerbaijan), with a median of 2.0 percent of GDP.
In line with the experience of other countries, it is mostly higher-income households that benefit from
the subsidy. Based on the 2004 Gabon EGEP household survey dataset, staff estimates that the top
10 percent of households receive about one-third of the total subsidy. Meanwhile, the bottom 30 percent of
individuals are estimated to receive only 13 percent of the subsidy, highlighting that fuel price subsidies are
a very costly way to protect the real incomes of the poor.

18.
Gabon public finances are characterized by severe weaknesses in the planning
and monitoring of public expenditure. Close to half of current expenditure is devoted to the
public sector wage bill and interest payments, while there are insufficient provisions for goods
and services and maintenance. Public investment has averaged 5 percent of GDP over the past
five years, but the return on this investment is estimated to have been very low or even
negative. Large infrastructure projects are often not subjected to rigorous cost-benefit analysis.
Notably, public investment in the context of the fêtes tournantes (the rotating regional
independence day celebrations) is notoriously unproductive, as confirmed by a recent audit
that revealed very serious weaknesses in control over procurement, execution, quality, and
prices.
19.
Improving public expenditure management is critical to raising the quality of
public investment and preventing a repetition of the 2005 slippages. A recent fiscal ROSC
mission and a World Bank public expenditure review both examined Gabon’s fiscal
institutional framework (Box 5). Key expenditure management recommendations include:
(i) establishing a hierarchy of priorities for investment projects in the Public Investment
Program to ensure a coherent selection system;14 (ii) ensuring that the functional expenditure
classification is finalized and implemented with the 2007 budget; (iii) subjecting expenditure
related to the fêtes tournantes to standard budgetary procedures and to the scrutiny of regular
published audits; (iv) streamlining budget execution and monitoring procedures to avoid
slippages; and (v) reporting spending on implicit fuel-price subsidies in the budget.
20.
Increasing the room for high-quality spending will require reversing the erosion
of non-oil revenue and enhancing the efficiency of public revenue management. The large
tax-payer unit (LTU) still needs to become fully operational. The tax system remains subject to
frequent discretionary modifications that are not reflected in the tax code. In addition, the
proliferation of tax exemptions has narrowed the tax base, notably for the VAT, and
non-transparent special tax regimes deter foreign direct investment. Key revenue management
recommendations reiterated in the recent ROSC include: (i) revising the tax code to reflect all
modifications; (ii) estimating the cost of tax expenditures and reporting them in the budget
documentation; and (iii) reinforcing oil revenue administration, including by replacing the
current annual projection model with a detailed monthly model. Problems also persist in
forestry taxation, where the lack of enforcement has had a negative impact on tax payer
compliance, and the mission urged the authorities to proceed rapidly with the return to the
public domain of forestry permits that cannot meet their tax obligations. The mission raised
concerns regarding a proposed law, currently with parliament, that would earmark—if
implemented—a large share of existing taxes (and possibly numerous new taxes and fees) for a
National Forestry Fund. The mission underlined that the proposed law is at odds with good
budgetary practice and would risk weakening governance in this important sector.

14

This recommendation would imply, for example, that the presidential projects promised in late 2005
should be appropriately prioritized and allowed to compete with other programs for scarce resources.

- 19 -

Box 5. Preliminary Conclusions of the 2006 Fiscal ROSC
Although the legal framework for fiscal management is well defined, implementation falls short of best
practice in several areas. The existence of two separate budgets, one for recurrent and one for
investment expenditures, prepared by two different ministries poses severe coordination problems.
Budget execution is subject to cumbersome procedures and ineffective compliance controls and the lack
of an effective financial information system precludes the production of regular and accurate reports.
Budget documentation is incomplete, excluding information on implicit subsidies and fiscal risks. The
tax system is subject to frequent discretionary modifications that are not reflected in the tax code.
The principal ROSC recommendations include the following:
•

Streamline fiscal policy formulation. Ensure the consistency of macroeconomic projections across
different ministries and departments. Prepare the 2007 budget in the context of a medium-term
expenditure framework for 2007–09. Establish a hierarchy of priorities for investment projects in
the Public Investment Program to ensure a coherent selection system.

•

Improve natural resource revenue transparency. To ensure that all oil revenues due to the
government—including those paid in kind—are collected by the Treasury, replace the current
annual projection model with a detailed monthly model. Extend coverage of the EITI report to
include profit oil (about half of oil revenues) and revenue streams in the mining sector.

•

Enhance budget transparency and presentation. Report revenue and expenditure that is currently
excluded, such as in-kind oil revenue that implicitly subsidizes fuel prices. Ensure that the
functional expenditure classification is finalized and implemented with the 2007 budget. Make the
budget documentation easier to understand by including summary tables for revenues and
expenditures, information on previous budgets, including their outturns, and estimates for the next
two fiscal years. Submit an updated tax code to parliament.

•

Develop a systematic fiscal risk-management strategy. Include a fiscal sustainability analysis that
accounts for the decline of oil revenue and an evaluation of the potential future liabilities of the
social security and pension funds in the budgetary documentation. Estimate and report the cost of
tax expenditures.

•

Streamline budget execution and monitoring procedures to avoid slippages. Prepare a monthly
limit for program appropriations and make the budget appropriations available from the beginning
of the fiscal year. Publish monthly execution reports. Reduce the treasury’s current 120-day
payment period to one month. Subject expenditure related to the fêtes tournantes to standard
budgetary procedures and to the scrutiny of regular published audits. Strictly enforce the decisions
of the public tender control office, report any slippages and, when appropriate, apply sanctions.

- 20 -

C. Structural Policies for Economic Diversification
21.
An uninviting business climate remains the country’s Achilles’ heel. To diversify
its economy, Gabon needs to attract private-sector investment to increase total factor
productivity and the country’s non-oil growth potential. The authorities need to accelerate their
structural reform agenda in the areas of the financial and labor markets, its trade regime, and—
in particular—governance.
22.
Financial sector stability has improved since the 2002 Financial Sector Stability
Assessment (FSAP), but important structural challenges remain.15, 16 Gabon’s financial
sector remains shallow even by regional standards, and banks appear to be withdrawing further
from lending activities. Credit to the private sector declined from a peak of over 13 percent of
GDP in 2002 to 9 percent in 2005, likely reflecting the effects of administratively determined
interest rate floors and ceilings as well as the difficulties faced by banks to effectively monitor
the quality of their loan portfolios (Box 6). In the absence of domestic lending opportunities,
or any other financial instruments, commercial banks have sharply increased their holdings of
foreign assets. At the same time, banks curtail their domestic activities by enforcing
restrictions on minimum deposits and/or depositors’ minimum income as a means to limiting
financial services to a few trusted enterprises, public-sector employees, and expatriates. Small
and medium-sized enterprises, in particular, have little access to the banking system. The
authorities agreed with staff’s analysis. They noted that underdevelopment of the financial
sector is partly a reflection of the nature of the Gabonese economy in which the dominant oil
sector is financed largely from abroad. But they agreed that it is crucial to improve private
sector access to the financial sector, including to micro-financing.
23.
Fostering diversification and Gabon’s integration in the global economy requires
trade liberalization, including at the regional level, and further flexibility of its labor
markets.17 The mission urged the authorities to play a lead role in regional discussions within
the CEMAC to foster progress in this area. In particular, the relatively high common external
tariff (CET), which affects about 22 percent of taxable imports, hampers private sector
development. Further liberalization, coupled with trade-enabling investments in infrastructure
and enhanced governance, would improve Gabon’s competitiveness and result in welfare
gains. The authorities agreed with the mission’s assessment, but noted that trade policy is
determined at a regional rather than a national level. They also expressed concern about the
15

See Gabon—Financial System Stability Assessment (Country Report 02/98) and the forthcoming
reports in the context of the regional FSAP for the Communauté Economique et Monétaire de l’Afrique
Centrale (CEMAC).

16

Discussions focused on financial sector development and vulnerability. The forthcoming regional
consultation with the CEMAC, tentatively scheduled for Board discussion in early July, will address in
depth the monetary and exchange rate policies at the level of the monetary union.

17

Arrangements in Africa, by Yongzheng Yang and Sanjeev Gupta (IMF, 2005).

- 21 -

fiscal implications of lowering the CET and its possible impact on the nascent agro-industries
that have begun to produce for the domestic market.18 Rigid labor markets are an additional
obstacle to increased private-sector activity, with deeply entrenched protection clauses—both
explicit and implicit—that make dismissals very difficult and costly.
Box 6. Insufficient Private-Sector Access to Credit
Gabon’s financial sector is shallow even by regional standards, and banks appear to be withdrawing
further from lending activities. High international oil prices resulted in an increased availability of funds.
However, credit to the private sector—already only about one-half the average of countries in sub-Saharan
Africa—continued to decline, from a
peak of 13.2 percent of GDP in 2002 to
Bank Assets and Liabilities, Jan. 2002 - Jan. 2006

from 22.6 to 19.0 percent of non-oil

A successful growth and poverty
reduction strategy will require a more active financial sector. In particular, it requires banks that are both
willing and able to increase access to credit by the private sector, possibly at rates lower than currently
prevailing. An accompanying selected issues paper, which models banks as profit maximizers over costly
monitoring, points to two principal constraints. It concludes that reforms in this area should aim at
(i) reducing the minimum rate on deposits (if not fully liberalize it); and (ii) overcoming structural obstacles
that have prevented banks thus far from assessing and monitoring effectively the credit risk of potential
clients’ investment proposals. Such a reform agenda needs to include measures to (i) strengthen the legal
environment for commercial matters; (ii) facilitate the registration of collateral and accelerate their
collection; (iii) reinforce creditor rights; and (iv) improve corporate accounting practices.

24.
Concluding rapidly the privatizations of Gabon Télécom and Air Gabon will
contribute to strengthening productivity while reducing the drain on the budget. The
mission welcomed the tender for a majority share in Gabon Télécom. It will now be important
that the remaining steps are taken to ensure a successful and transparent sale by mid-year, as
envisaged by the government’s timetable. The liquidation of Air Gabon is an important
recognition that the public sector is ill-placed to manage a commercial airline. The objective
18

Preliminary staff estimates suggest that the revenue loss from lowering the maximum tariff rate from
30 to 20 percent would be about ¾ percent of non-oil GDP.

- 22 -

should now be to allow the liquidator to complete its task as fast as possible, and without
undue interference. The mission welcomed the agreement to establish a new airline, Air Gabon
International (AGI), in which Royal Air Maroc (RAM) would have a majority stake; however,
it expressed regret that until AGI becomes operational the government will continue to bear
part of the financial burden of operating several routes deemed important, at a cost estimated at
over CFAF 2 billion. This sends a mixed signal regarding the government’s commitment to
withdrawal from the airline business, and it will need to make it clear that its financial
involvement will end when AGI becomes operational.
25.
Improving governance and containing corruption are critical to improving the
business climate. The 2004 governance indicators published by the World Bank rank Gabon
in the bottom third on the control of corruption.19 On Transparency International’s Corruption
Perception Index, Gabon slipped from the 74th place in 2004 (with a score of 3.3) to 88th
place in 2005 (with a of score 2.9). Recent initiatives to improve governance have yet to show
their effectiveness. The 2004 diagnosis of Gabon’s investment climate by the World Bank’s
Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) has not yet been translated into a comprehensive
action plan. The National Commission Against Illicit Enrichment has taken important first
steps, but challenges remain to enforce its asset declaration system. According to the
Commission’s Annual Report 2005, about one-third of senior officials had filed their income
and wealth statements by end-June 2005 (with the number having increased to about one-half
by year’s end). The mission urged the Commission to move ahead and accelerate the
implementation of the financial disclosure regime and to move forward in other areas,
including investigations.
26.
Significant scope remains to increase transparency and improve the availability of
economic information in Gabon. Over the past few years, several important audits and
reports have been prepared, highlighting the problems faced by various public institutions.
Some have been published, including the list of forestry permit holders, but many documents
are not regularly published or are very difficult to access. The mission urged the authorities to
make further progress in transparency and publish key documents on the government’s
internet site, including the reports of the supreme audit office (cour des comptes) on budget
execution in 2003 and 2004, the supplementary budget laws for 2004 and 2005, the recent
audits of the fêtes tournantes and the road maintenance fund (FER), as well as the annual
reports of the National Commission Against Illicit Enrichment. In addition, progress needs to
be made to establish a system of regular public reporting of economic statistics consistent with
the GDDS framework, including timely and comprehensive reports on public finances. Rapid
adoption of a new statistics law and a boost in the resources of the Statistics Directorate should
therefore be a priority. The authorities underscored their commitment to raising transparency
and to making available to a larger audience several reports.

Transparency in the oil sector received a welcome boost with the publication of
Gabon’s first EITI report. The mission encouraged the authorities to increase further the
transparency of oil sector operations by broadening the coverage of the next report. The
authorities noted that they are in the process of drawing lessons from their first EITI report and
hope to be able to broaden the coverage of the next report, scheduled for the third quarter
of 2006, to include profit oil (the share of crude oil accruing to the government under the
production sharing arrangements). They also plan to extend the report to the mining sector.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
In 2005, Gabon continued to enjoy record high oil prices, buoying both exports
and government revenues. Benefiting from high prices for other primary commodities, and
the macroeconomic discipline established in the context of the 2004–05 Stand-By
Arrangement, non-oil growth also accelerated while inflation remained moderate, resulting in
the first increase in per-capita GDP since 1999. The elimination of external and domestic
arrears and the lowering of external debt provided a welcome boost to confidence,
complementing the far-reaching structural reforms initiated since 2004. However, the
presidential elections in late-2005 were accompanied by large fiscal slippages and delays in
structural reforms, and the parliamentary elections scheduled for late 2006 pose a further risk
for financial stability. The key short-term priority must therefore be to re-establish fiscal
discipline and re-invigorate the structural reform program.
29.
The critical medium-term challenge facing Gabon is managing the transition from
an economy highly dependent on oil to a diversified economy that harnesses private
sector initiative and makes decisive progress in poverty reduction. The current high levels
of oil prices represent an opportunity to lower debt levels decisively, thereby reducing a major
source of Gabon’s past vulnerability to shocks. They also allow the government to address
some of the pressing social and infrastructural needs facing the country. The challenge for
policy is to strike a judicious balance between the pressures for public spending to address
these needs and raising public savings to prepare for the inevitable exhaustion of oil reserves
and the decline in the government’s main revenue source. But without macroeconomic
stability and effective public financial management, sharp increases in public spending are
unlikely to be effective nor sustainable. For both these reasons, it will be critical to save the
bulk of the oil windfall in the coming years.
30.
The fiscal policy stance in 2006 requires significant tightening. The end-2005
slippages have pushed the non-oil primary deficit well above sustainable levels. Both
sustainability and vulnerability concerns suggest that the slippages should be fully reversed
in 2006. A full assessment of the fiscal stance also requires taking into account the fastgrowing implicit subsidies on petroleum products, which under the current regime could reach
4½ of non-oil GDP in 2006. These subsidies are benefiting primarily higher income
households and it will be important to adjust retail prices to import parity levels. The social
and economic impact of such a adjustment can be mitigated by doing so gradually and by
raising targeted subsidies to the poor. In any case, to increase transparency and accountability,
the foregone revenue and implicit subsidies should be reflected fully in the budget.

- 24 -

31.
Improving public expenditure management is critical to strengthening
expenditure control and raising the quality of public investment. The recent fiscal
transparency ROSC revealed significant shortcomings in the planning, monitoring, and ex-post
control of public expenditure, as well as in revenue administration. Key measures required
include a more effective prioritization of the public investment program; strengthening budget
execution and monitoring; improving the transparency of the budget, notably of oil revenue;
and improving the efficiency of the tax system by broadening the non-oil revenue base. Efforts
should be made to address these issues with urgency, at the latest in the context of the 2007
budget.
32.
Raising economic growth and reducing poverty necessitate the acceleration of the
structural reform agenda. The GPRSP needs to be made operational by formulating
concrete poverty-reducing programs. There is also a need to improve the investment climate to
foster private sector development. The problems are well known and include legal and
regulatory uncertainty, the absence of a dynamic financial sector, rigid labor markets, and
continued weaknesses in governance. Notably, the rapid conclusion of the privatization of Air
Gabon and Gabon Télécom will contribute to strengthening the productivity of Gabon’s
economy. Going forward, it will be important to ensure that the successor airline to Air Gabon
no longer represents a drain on public resources.
33.
Fostering transparency is a key ingredient to strengthening governance and
accountability. Progress has been made and the recent publication of Gabon’s first EITI
report represents a further important step. Nevertheless, significant scope remains to reinforce
transparency. There is a need to improve access to information, including through the regular
publication of timely and accurate economic statistics and the broader dissemination of
government reports. The work of the National Commission Against Illicit Enrichment should
be accelerated, including in the area of investigations. Work on the EITI needs to continue,
with the objective of making its next report more comprehensive, notably by including
revenue streams related to profit oil. And reforms in the forestry sector, which had a strong
start in 2004, should resume, notably by dealing decisively with the holders of forestry permits
that have tax arrears and ensuring that its financing remains within the government budget.
34.
Gabon is at a crucial juncture. The current high oil prices are an opportunity to
decisively lower debt levels, thereby reducing Gabon’s historical vulnerability to oil price
swings, and address the country’s pressing social and infrastructural needs. This will require
maintaining sound economic policies and, in particular, raising the quality of public spending.
But high oil prices and temporarily higher government revenue do not change the reality that
oil resources are finite and will eventually run out. Policies must be sustainable and provide an
environment in which both the public and the private sectors can contribute to tackling the
great challenges facing Gabon: ensuring sustained, broad-based growth and prosperity for all
future generations.

APPENDIX II

Gabon: Relations with the World Bank
(Updated as of May 8, 2006)
1.
Gabon is a resource rich country with a small, highly urbanized population. As one of
Africa’s few IBRD countries, Gabon’s GNI per capita is estimated at US$4,130 in 2004, well
above the sub-Saharan African (SSA) average. Oil is Gabon’s key economic sector and the
principal driving force of its economic growth. However, the country’s oil revenues are
projected to decline over the next few years, and the Government has started exploring the
country’s potential for economic diversification. The Bank is working closely with the IMF
team to support structural measures, particularly for the development of the private and forestry
sectors, to assist in the development of the local private sector in urban areas; and to support the
preparation of the Government’s Poverty Reduction Strategy.
The Bank Group strategy and lending operations
2.
The Gabon Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was approved by the Board of Directors
on May 24, 2005. The strategy is articulated around two pillars: (1) strengthening the
management of public resources (both natural and financial) for improved social outcomes; and
(2) improving the investment climate to foster sustainable, private sector led non-oil growth.
Cross-cutting themes are developing capacity in Government and civil society, and improving
governance and participation.
3.
The Bank is presently in a base-case assistance program which includes three lending
operations in the urban, natural resources, and infrastructure sectors: a US$15 million Natural
Resources Management Development Policy Loan was approved in November 2005, a
US$25 million Public Investment Program for Local Infrastructure Development Project is
planned for Bank Board in March 2006, and a US$25 million Infrastructure Project is planned
in FY08. Each operation places emphasis on improving transparency and efficiency in the use
of public resources, including natural resources, and on improving the environment for greater
participation of the private sector.
4.
Currently IFC has an exposure of US$32.5 million in the oil and gas sector, and the
World Bank Group’s Foreign Investment Advisory Services (FIAS) has recently completed a
diagnostic study of the investment climate. A US$61 million MIGA guarantee facility for
rehabilitation and modernization of a professional training institute was approved by the Board
in May 2005. This project is MIGA’s first in the education sector.
IMF—World Bank collaboration
5.
Overall, the IMF and World Bank staff maintain a close collaboration in supporting
reforms to foster economic diversification and in coordinating their policy advice to the
Gabonese authorities. In view of the structural measures envisaged under the medium-term
program, successful implementation of the reform program hinges on complementary action by
the World Bank, especially in the areas of business climate improvements, effective and
efficient public resources management, poverty reduction policies, and nonrenewable resource

A Poverty Assessment (PA), initiated in late 1994, was finalized in March 1997 and
discussed with a broad range of Gabonese stakeholders in July 1997. The main conclusion of
the report is that the relative inefficiency and low quality of public expenditures, particularly in
the social sectors, constitute major impediments to poverty alleviation. The Bank is supporting
the preparation of the Government’s poverty reduction strategy, and in that context, will
continue to provide support for strengthening the statistical capacity and assisting the NSO
(National Statistical Office). In summer of 2005, the Bank provided financial and technical
assistance to undertake key household surveys (using a Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire
(CWIQ)) to update key social indicators to be monitored on an annual basis. Results of the
CWIQ household survey are now available and had been used in finalizing the I-PRSP. The
Bank also plans to assist the NSO in putting together a monitoring and evaluation system for

- 40 -

APPENDIX II

the poverty reduction strategy. A new Poverty Assessment based on the expenditure module of
the CWIQ survey has been completed by the Bank in December, 2005. This assessment will
provide the basis for regular monitoring of the poverty trends in Gabon. Together with the
programs and sectoral strategies developed under the GPRSP, it will provide a stronger
foundation for directing resources to poverty alleviation in the longer-term.

Forest and other natural resources. In November 2005, the Bank’s board approved a
$15 million Natural Resources Management Development Policy Loan which covers the forest,
environment, fisheries, and mining/oil sectors. In the oil sector, this DPL is limited to
supporting the implementation of the EITI. In March 2006, the Board also approved a
$10 million grant from the Global Environment Facility for Gabon’s national parks. The DPL
focuses on improving transparency, law enforcement, and removing policy distortions. It is also
designed to help the Gabonese authorities implement reform programs and empower civil
society organizations and local communities in managing natural resources. The project
outcomes are expected to broaden the number of beneficiaries and raise social and
environmental standards in the forestry, fishing and mining sectors, and thus assisting the
government in its efforts to diversify the Gabonese economy and reduce its dependence on the
oil sector.
8.
In June 2004, the Bank completed a US$ 7 million Pilot Community Infrastructure
Development Project (Learning and Innovation Loan) designed to test new methods for
building community-based infrastructure and providing support for local contractors. The goal
was to improve living conditions in selected poor urban neighborhoods in a sustainable way
and with substantial community participation. The project also aimed at building local capacity
to undertake a larger program of community-based public works. Based on this successful
initiative, the Bank approved on March 14, 2006 a US$25 million loan to (i) increase access of
the population living in low-income settlements to basic services; and (ii) sustain access of
local SMEs to civil works and construction contracts with the public sector. The project is
likely to increase access of the poor to infrastructure and services, strengthen the role of
SMESs, and improve the quality of public works through increased transparency, and efficient
procurement and contract management."
9.
A combined Public Expenditure Review/Country Financial Accountability
Assessment/Country Procurement and Audit Review, is under preparation and is planned for
completion in FY06. The aim of this activity is to improve public expenditure management
and control systems, ensuring that allocated funds are used for the purposes they were intended
and that they achieve the expected results.
10.
The FIAS (a joint facility of the World Bank and International Finance Corporation) is
providing advisory services to help improve the investment climate in Gabon. Under this
program, a diagnostic of the investment climate, including identification of priorities for reform
and concrete recommendations, was completed in September 2004. The authorities held a
validation workshop in February, 2005 to discuss the recommendations and establish an action
plan for their implementation. Two further studies were envisioned to identify constraints to
private investment and to provide an action plan to remedy impediments to private sector

- 41 -

APPENDIX II

growth, including a detailed review of administrative barriers to investment and an in-depth
review of the tax and incentive regime (also with an objective of proposing concrete
reforms/changes), respectively. Each study is to be confirmed based on action taken on the
previous one.
11.
The Bank is also preparing an Infrastructure Framework Report (IFR), which will
present a comprehensive overview of the country's general environment for private
participation and the main opportunities for investment in infrastructure. The report will also
outline recommendations and an action plan to assist the government in putting in place the
laws, policies, and institutions needed to create an enabling environment for enhanced privatesector participation. This study covers transport infrastructure (railways, air transport, and
maritime transport), telecommunications, water, and power.
Areas of shared responsibility
12.
While the Bank has taken the lead in structural reforms impacting the environment for
the private sector, the IMF has a strong interest in the same area from a macroeconomic
perspective. The IMF’s primary focus is on good governance, particularly in the fiscal area, and
on the promotion of transparency in both the public and the private sectors. Additional
concerns for the Bank include efficiency of the resulting market structures and improved
enterprise operation. The Bank and the IMF are also working closely together in the financial
sector, for which a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) was jointly prepared by the
two institutions during 2002. While the FSAP indicated that the financial sector in Gabon is
overall profitable and stable, it also identified certain structural weaknesses and risks in
Gabon’s financial sector, including lack of bank portfolio diversification and
underdevelopment of non-bank financial institutions.
13.
Areas where the Fund takes the lead role and its analysis serves as input into the
World Bank–supported program are in the dialogue on fiscal matters, which sets the overall
envelope for public expenditures. The IMF is also providing technical assistance in the area of
governance and anticorruption.
14.
The IMF leads the dialogue on policies to contain various expenditures in the public
sector. These include policies regarding the wage bill in the public sector and the definition of
the ceiling for public investment expenditures. In these areas, the Bank takes into account the
policy recommendations of the IMF and ensures that its own policy advice is consistent.
15.
In addition, the IMF is monitoring the implementation of the Uniform Acts of the
Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa (OHADA) and trade
liberalization measures being taken at the CEMAC (regional) level. This supplements a
significant on-going program of work by the Bank to support regional integration among
CEMAC countries. These measures should improve the business climate and will complement
work by the Bank (in conjunction with the IFC) in the area of facilitating investment.
16.
Areas in which the IMF leads and there is no direct World Bank involvement relate
to the dialogue on monetary policy, interest rates, the exchange rate, the balance of payments,
and related statistical and measurement issues.

APPENDIX III

The Growth and Poverty-Reduction Strategy Paper20
The GPRSP must permit the implementation of programs and structural
reforms that create wealth and employment, by developing sectors other
than oil to accelerate the growth of the national economy.
—Government of Gabon

INTRODUCTION
1.
Against the background of depleting oil reserves and a currently favorable price
environment, the Gabonese authorities—in consultation with civil society and the donor
community—have prepared a comprehensive socio-economic development strategy. With its
implementation, Gabon seeks to take full advantage of its natural resources and competitive
advantages. In early 2006, the government publicly presented its Growth and PovertyReduction Strategy Paper (GPRSP), locally referred to as the Document de stratégie de
croissance et de réduction de la pauvreté.
2.
In January 2002, Gabon started the process of developing a national
development plan. A preliminary strategy, contained in the 2004 interim PRSP, was
subsequently discussed with stakeholders to deepen the participatory process, update the
poverty profile, develop sectoral strategies, and place the development strategy within a
macroeconomic framework. Over the course of a year, between July 2004 and June 2005, the
authorities, supported by multilateral development partners, organized regional, multi-day
consultations with employers’ organizations, civil society, NGOs, the Economic and Social
Council, and Parliament. In parallel, they established sectoral working groups on (i) poverty
analysis; (ii) growth promotion; (iii) infrastructure development; (iv) access to social
services; (v) improvement of governance and the business climate; (vi) the macroeconomic
framework; and (vii) monitoring and evaluation.
DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES: POVERTY
3.
The GPRSP rests on an in-depth poverty diagnostic. A detailed analysis of the
poverty profile draws on comprehensive surveys undertaken by the government over the
previous five years, including the Core Welfare Indicators Survey (CWIQ), the National
Participatory Poverty Assessment, and the Health and Demographic Survey. The poverty
analysis fills important gaps in the comprehension of poverty.
4.
The GPRSP recognizes that poverty in Gabon is severe and widespread, despite
being one of the richest countries in Africa. Gabon is highly of urbanized, with 80 percent
20

This appendix was prepared in consultation with the World Bank country team.

- 43 -

APPENDIX III

of the population living in cities. Defining the poverty line, on a national average, as income
of less than CFAF 429,336 (US$818), that is at a level of about 13 percent of per capita GDP
in 2005, about one-third of Gabonese are considered poor. The poverty survey dissects
poverty according to a number of regional, professional, social, and educational criteria. It
documents large income inequalities, with a Gini coefficient of 0.437, and provides a
plethora of detailed social indicators that will facilitate the development, implementation, and
evaluation of sectoral strategies. The poverty section does not, however, include a gender
analysis, which could take into account the differences in (i) opportunities and constraints
that women and men encounter; and (ii) access to, and control over, resources and public
services.
OBJECTIVES OF THE GPRSP
5.
The GPRSP aims at developing a policy program and structural reforms to
improve employment opportunities by fostering growth in the non-oil sectors. The
document stresses the importance of combining efforts of both the public and private sectors
in order to create favorable conditions that would help to provide (i) an educational system
that is adapted to the needs in these sectors; (ii) adequate public infrastructure in transport,
energy, and telecommunications; (iii) an efficient health system prepared to treat, especially,
malaria and HIV/AIDS; and (iv) a transparent and efficient public administration and judicial
system.
6.
To achieve these overriding objectives, the GPRSP defines four central pillars on
which the strategy rests, viz.,
(i)

the creation of a growth-promoting environment by improving the overall business
climate, accelerating regional integration, increasing competitiveness, and
diversifying the economy;

(ii) the strengthening of public infrastructure in order to improve the country as a site to
do business by reducing the private sector’s cost of production and increasing its
competitiveness;
(iii) the broadening the access to basic public services to improve the well-being of the
Gabonese population and increase its human capital; and
(iv) the improvement in overall governance by reinforcing the rule of law, opening the
political system, increasing accountability and transparency, and citizen’s
participation.
The GPRSP’s sectoral priorities are generally specific and well-developed in their objectives,
but remaining shortcomings need to be addressed in subsequent documents.

- 44 -

APPENDIX III

ASSESSMENT
A. The Macroeconomic Framework
7.
The macroeconomic framework does not take into account the fiscal challenges
stemming from the anticipated decline in oil production. Gabon’s oil revenues currently
comprise 60 percent of government revenue, but oil reserves are expected to be exhausted
within three decades. Ensuring that fiscal policy is on a sustainable path is therefore a high
priority to prevent a situation, in which the government would need to rapidly adjust fiscal
policy in tandem with declining oil production. Given the existence of exhaustible natural
resources and volatile international prices, the macroeconomic framework needs to include a
discussion of long-term fiscal sustainability, especially as sharp adjustments to public
expenditure are likely to have a disproportionate impact on the most disadvantaged segments
in society.
8.
The GPRSP needs to be complemented by a full-fledged, medium-term
expenditure framework (MTEF). The GPRSP presents three macroeconomic scenarios.
However, for two scenarios, growth rates are derived on the basis of a given policy outcome,
with public investments closing the model—resulting in very rapid growth rates in public
investment. While the annex on sectoral action plans and financial programming shows some
costing, the document contains inconsistencies relative to the envisaged investment path. The
projected continuous decline in current expenditure, for instance, suggests an insufficient
costing of required future maintenance expenditures. To achieve this consistency between the
strategy and the annual budgets, the authorities would have to present the costing of
individual projects and their recurrent budgetary implications in the context of a full-fledged
(three-year) MTEF. This would help to prioritize projects across and within sectors and
define financing needs and resource availability.
B.

Creation of a Growth-Promoting Environment

9.
Gabon’s development strategy underplays the importance of providing a
business climate that is conducive to attracting foreign direct investment (FDI). Gabon
needs to attract FDI of the scale and scope to increase overall factor productivity. While the
GPRSP correctly defines as objectives the implementation of a large range of reforms aimed
at providing the private sector with an attractive environment, a long-term planning horizon,
the capacity to protect contracts and property rights in the courts of law, and to reduce the
microeconomic costs of doing business, the strategy remains relatively vague on
corresponding measures. The GPRSP only touches on issues related to the insufficient supply
of bank credit to the private sector, without offering a strategy to overcome the principal
structural obstacles that have, thus far, prevented more dynamism in the private sector. The
GPRSP mentions, but does not fully explore, the potential for a closer cooperation between
the public and private sectors in Gabon. The GPRSP largely de-emphasizes the important
tertiary sectors (in particular, banking and telecommunications).

- 45 -

APPENDIX III

10.
The forestry and environmental strategy is well-developed. However, several
issues (e.g., law enforcement, state disengagement, and rural livelihoods) are missing from
this section. Reform measures contained in the Letter of Sector Policy and supported by the
recently-approved World Bank Natural Resources Development Policy Loan are not fully
reflected in the GPRSP.
C.

The Government’s Role in Socio-Economic Development

11.
The GPRSP provides a candid assessment of the key issues confronting the
transport sector. The GPRSP includes very ambitious road development projects, including
the construction of 1,500 kilometers of new roads, at a cost of more than CFAF 460 billion
(the equivalent of about 10 percent of GDP in 2005), with associated maintenance costs
estimated at CFAF 20 billion a year. Similar investment projects, such as the construction of
deep-sea harbors and airports, also contain very high investment and subsequent maintenance
costs. Not all have immediate budgetary implications, but the document does not fully
explore alternative options, including public-private partnerships, which could pose
challenges in terms of transparency and fiscal risk.
12.
The GPRSP does not clearly define criteria according to which public
investment projects are prioritized. Implicitly, the strategy requires public investments to
crowd in private investments, but the GPRSP does not contain a comprehensive discussion
on the mechanisms by which proposed capital expenditures will create positive externalities
in production.
13.
The GPRSP highlights the challenges in strengthening public institutions and
enhancing transparency—a precondition for improved policy outcomes. The quality of a
country’s institutional framework represents a critical factor in foreign companies’ decisions
on whether or not to invest on the scale and scope to increase overall factor productivity in
Gabon. The GPRSP identified a number of cross-cutting issues that are critical for poverty
reduction, including governance. The GPRSP does not fully reflect the steps already taken, in
particular, (i) the creation of the National Commission Against Illicit Enrichment (CNCEI);
(ii) the establishment of the Department of Public Procurement (DGMP), with started its
operation with an audit of the Road Maintenance Fund (FER); and (iii) the first publication
of a report under the principles of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI),
including the recruitment of an independent auditor charged to identify oil-related payment
streams on the basis of information provided by the government and the oil companies.
Follow-up documents could reinforce related sections by including a discussion on the key
issues and recommendations of the Public Expenditure Management and Financial
Accountability (PEMFAR) and the Report on Standards and Codes (ROSC) reviews.

- 46 -

APPENDIX III

IMPLEMENTATION RISKS AND FOLLOW-UP
14.
High oil prices and the highly decentralized government represent the principal
risks to an ultimately successful implementation of Gabon’s socio-economic
development strategy. The preparation of the GPRSP revealed a weak coordination between
the responsible Technical Secretariat in the Planning Ministry and the newly created Ministry
for Poverty Reduction. More generally, with currently 49 ministries,21 there is a divergence
in interests and, hence, a non-uniform degree of ownership of the objectives spelt out in the
GPRSP. In addition, the currently favorable environment increases the probability to
additional pressures for unbudgeted, non-GPRSP spending, jeopardizing the implementation
of a longer term GPRSP investment strategy. However, general ownership of the socioeconomic development strategy has been reinforced through the consultative process during
its conception. With a sufficient emphasis on ensuring the adequate capacity and
participation of the line ministries in priority sectors (including health, education, and
infrastructure), paired with an increased degree of public awareness and participation and a
closer cooperation among the government, civil society, and development partners, Gabon
should be able to implement successfully its socio-economic development strategy.
15.
An effective monitoring and evaluating process necessitates the development of
observable targets. The intermediate outcome indicators defined by the Gabonese
authorities mark a significant first step towards a comprehensive system of monitoring and
evaluation, which will allow the government, the legislative, the public, and the external
development partners to fine-tune the implementation of Gabon’s socio-economic
development strategy. However, the identification of broad outcome indicators—that is,
measurable objectives and targets—will require additional work and improved coordination
within the government.

21

Three Ministries are charged with various aspects of budgetary implementation, viz., the Ministries of
Economy, Finance, Budget, and Privatization (non-oil revenue and recurrent expenditure), Planning (capital
expenditure), and Mining and Oil (oil revenue).

APPENDIX IV

Gabon: Assessing External and Public Sector Debt Sustainability
1.
Staff analyzed the sustainability of Gabon’s external and public sector debt
using the agreed debt sustainability framework (DSF) for market-access countries. This
framework focuses on debt-to-GDP ratios as an indicator of solvency. Stable or declining
ratios are taken as evidence that the current account or budgetary surpluses are adequate to
cover future debt service, and thus the solvency condition is met. The analysis undertaken
compared base-line projections with an “unbiased” scenario where all variables are assumed
to evolve in line with historical averages. Furthermore, it subjected the results of the baseline
scenario to a number of stress tests.
2.
The analysis demonstrates that Gabon’s debt stocks do not present sustainability
problems if the favorable assumptions underlying the baseline materialize. Despite
relatively high debt stocks—39 percent of GDP for external debt and 44 percent for total
public sector debt—the buoyant outlook for the oil sector permits the amortization of this
debt without the need for new borrowing. For both categories of debt, the ratio to GDP drops
under the baseline scenario to about 10 percent by 2011. (Tables 1 and 2). In addition to debt
reduction, the baseline envisages the rapid accumulation of foreign reserves, to about
90 percent of GDP by 2011 (explaining the large residual in the external DSA table). Thus,
asset management should soon be more important than liability management in Gabon.
3.
The conclusions of the baseline scenarios are confirmed by the “historical
averages” scenarios. The projections under the historical scenarios differ from the baseline
in two respects mainly: a lower average annual GDP growth of 1.1 percent and a lower
current account surplus reflecting past oil prices rather than the much higher level they
attained in 2005. With oil prices likely to stay high—the baseline is based on WEO
projections—the latter assumption appears unrealistic. Despite more conservative
assumptions (unrealistically so, given WEO oil projections) the public sector debt ratio
would continue to drop, while for external debt it climbs slightly, underlining the importance
of debt reduction. However, it remains below the critical range of 40-60 percent above which
the probability of a crisis typically mounts.
4.
Stress tests confirm the absence of sustainability problems. The effect of the
growth shock is mild and debt ratios would continue to decline. On the other hand, under the
current account shock—i.e., much lower oil prices—the debt ratio would remain constant.
The depreciation scenario boosts external debt ratios (valuation effects), but public-sectordebt-to-GDP stress tests show that, despite a significant upward effect, debt ratios would
continue to decline (Figure 2).

Gabon: Statistical Issues
1.
Gabon’s economic database is fairly comprehensive. While data are generally
compiled in accordance with international standards, consistency between sectors is poor,
raising questions about the quality of the data. Detailed economic and financial statistics,
including long historical time series, are published in the Tendances de l’Économie, issued
on a semiannual basis by the General Directorate of Statistics and Economic Studies
(DGSEE) of the Ministry of Planning. More recent sectoral developments are described in
detail in the Tableau de Bord de l'Économie, issued on a quarterly basis by the General
Directorate for the Economy (DGE) of the Ministry of Economy, Finance, Budget, and
Privatization.
2.
Gabon is a participant in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). Metadata
regarding Gabon’s national statistical systems, including plans for improvement, were posted
to the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board on October 1, 2002, but have not been
updated since then. The authorities do not report any real sector statistics for publication in
International Financial Statistics (IFS), nor any fiscal data for publication in the IFS or
Government Finance Statistics (GFS) Yearbook.
National accounts
3.
The base for the calculation of national accounts aggregates at constant prices was
changed from 1989 to 1991. Coverage of developments in oil and other key export sectors is
based on a range of indicators that may not fully capture the profits generated by these
sectors. Despite recent improvements in collecting and processing oil sector statistics,
significant inconsistencies remain between national accounts and the balance of payments
statistics. In addition, more frequent household surveys are required to improve the quality
and quantity of data available on income distribution and consumption. Efforts to establish a
more consistent database need to be strengthened.
Employment and unemployment
4.

Data on unemployment and the total labor force are not systematically available.

Prices
5.
Monthly consumer price indices for low- and middle-income households are available
only for the capital city of Libreville. Significant parts of the population live in other urban
areas such as Port Gentil. These indices are based on an outdated expenditure survey from
1975 and attach a large weight to food and basic consumer goods prices.
Government accounts
6.
A key shortcoming of macroeconomic statistics is the limited coverage of fiscal data,
as no estimates of the consolidated general government are reported to STA. This hampers
full understanding of general government expenditure priorities. Moreover, the social

- 53 -

APPENDIX V

security operations are not yet included in government finances. In addition, the audited
accounts of oil sector operations are not published with adequate periodicity (at least
quarterly), preventing adequate monitoring of key fiscal and activity indicators. Other needed
improvements relate, inter alia, to the statistical treatment of oil companies’ tax advances,
recording in the budget accounts government investment financed by oil companies, and the
recording of government domestic payment arrears.
7.
While a fairly good database exists on the operations of public enterprises,
information is communicated to the staff on an ad hoc basis, notably during Fund missions.
At present, data provided cover the wholly owned and mixed enterprises in which
government equity participation is at least 25 percent.
Monetary statistics
8.
Monthly monetary data for Gabon, as well as for the other members of the Central
African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC), are reported on a regular basis,
although with some delay. The data are reported in electronic form by the regional central
bank (BEAC) and published in IFS. The institutional coverage of the monetary statistics is
comprehensive, but accuracy is affected by cross-border movements of currency among
CEMAC member countries. In the case of Gabon, however, the magnitude of imported notes
is smaller than in other countries in the region. About 95 percent of notes in Gabon are
nationally issued; the remaining are from Cameroon, the Republic of Congo, and Equatorial
Guinea. Gabon exports about 17 percent of its notes, most of which go to Cameroon
(11 percent) and to the Republic of Congo (4 percent).
9.
The monetary and financial statistics mission that visited BEAC headquarters
(May 2001) provided technical assistance in addressing the main shortcomings pertaining to
coverage, methodology, compilation procedures, and timeliness of monetary statistics. The
mission discussed an action plan for the implementation of the Monetary and Financial
Statistics Manual (MFSM) and for the introduction of an area-wide page in IFS for CEMAC.
Following the 2001 mission, a regional workshop on monetary and financial statistics was
organized by the BEAC in Libreville (Gabon) in May 2002 to support the implementation of
the MFSM in CEMAC countries. The new page for CEMAC was published in the January
2003 issue of IFS.
External public debt
10.
There are comprehensive data on the outstanding stock of external public debt and its
composition, together with detailed projections on debt service due. These data are provided
(usually to Fund missions) by the General Directorate of Public Debt and Accounting
(Direction générale de la comptabilité publique) of the Ministry of Economy, Finance,
Budget, and Privatization.

- 54 -

APPENDIX V

Balance of payments and trade statistics
11.
Balance of payments data are usually disseminated with considerable delays,
although some progress has been made recently with the transmission of data up to 2003. As
in most other countries of CEMAC, balance of payments data are compiled and disseminated
by the national agency of BEAC for Gabon. The compilation process involves close
cooperation between BEAC headquarters and the national agency for Gabon since BEAC
headquarters calculates the national contribution in the international reserves it holds and
manages on behalf of all six countries. The headquarters also validate the draft results and
run consistency checks against the guidelines adopted for the whole monetary union.
12.
Since 1995, the dissemination of balance of payments statistics has been in
accordance with the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). Source data are primarily
reported through (i) surveys of enterprises by the central bank (main source of data);
(ii) reports from banks and the postal administration on foreign exchange transactions of
other enterprises, retailers, and private individuals; and (iii) BEAC reports on banknotes
issued by Gabon and returned by other BEAC countries.
13.
External trade data are mostly based on estimates, which are not cross-checked with
customs data. The reliability of other items of the current account is poor due to the low
response rate to the enterprise surveys, in spite of partial correction through adjustments.
Foreign direct investment in the financial account is likely to be underestimated owing to the
insufficient detail of the oil sector survey. The overall magnitude and detailed breakdown of
private capital flows, particularly those related to the short term, suffer from a lack of
comprehensiveness.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
June 5, 2006

This statement provides additional information that has become available since the
circulation of the staff report. It does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.

1.

2.
Preliminary data for the first quarter of 2006 suggest that economic activity has
remained buoyant. A slowdown in oil and manganese production, due to temporary rather
than permanent factors, was more than offset by continued strong growth in commerce,
services, and construction. The authorities’ projection of 3½ percent growth in non-oil GDP
in 2006 remains well within reach.
3.
Inflation picked up in April 2006 from very low levels, reaching 1.8 percent
year-on-year. The main source of the increase is imported food products.
4.
Preliminary fiscal data for the first quarter of 2006 indicate that the fiscal
slippages of 2005 have not yet been fully reversed. The non-oil primary deficit reached
2½ percent of projected non-oil GDP by end-March, reflecting continued high levels of
expenditures on transfers and goods and services, confirming that significant fiscal
adjustment is needed to return to a sustainable medium-term path.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 13, 2006

International Monetary Fund

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with Gabon
On June 5, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Gabon.1
Background
In 2005, economic growth picked up to 3 percent while inflation remained low. Non-oil growth
reached 4 ½ percent, led by rising timber processing, manganese production, and the services
sector. Meanwhile, buoyant international oil prices continued to stimulate investment and
exploration in the oil sector. As a result, both the balance of payments and the fiscal accounts
registered large surpluses, allowing a reduction in external debt to 39 percent of GDP at
end-2005.
The presidential elections in late 2005 were accompanied by large fiscal slippages. The non-oil
primary deficit reached 12 percent of non-oil GDP, compared with a target of 8½ percent in the
government’s supplementary budget. The bulk of the slippages reflected additional non-interest
current expenditure, lower recovery of tax arrears, and a larger impact of personal income tax
exemptions than originally anticipated.
The structural reform agenda stalled in the second half of 2005. In particular, the restructuring
and privatization of Air Gabon and Gabon Télécom experienced significant delays. After a
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2–
strong start in 2004, delays continued to plague the reforms of the forestry sector, reflected in
the persistence of large forestry tax arrears and uncertainty regarding the future allocation of
forestry permits. However, reforms in the natural resources sector were boosted by the
publication of Gabon’s first report under the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative in
December 2005. A tender for 51 percent of Gabon Télécom was finally launched in early
December with the aim of completing the sale by mid-2006. The government announced the
liquidation of Air Gabon in February 2006 and the creation of a new airline, Air Gabon
International, in which Royal Air Maroc will hold majority stake.
Looking ahead, the critical challenge facing Gabon is to seize the opportunity provided by high
oil prices to place macroeconomic policies on a long-term sustainable path while fostering
economic diversification and preparing Gabon for the post-oil era.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors welcomed the acceleration in economic activity and the authorities’ success in
restoring macroeconomic stability in 2004–05, with the support of a Stand-By Arrangement.
Directors noted that Gabon’s key policy challenge is to strike a judicious balance between
preparing for the inevitable exhaustion of oil reserves by raising public savings and dealing with
continued pressures for public spending. They emphasized that the current high levels of oil
prices provide an opportunity to lower debt to manageable levels, thereby reducing a major
source of Gabon’s vulnerability to shocks, while addressing the country’s pressing social and
infrastructural needs.
Directors underlined that fiscal discipline is critical for macroeconomic stability and expressed
concern about the large fiscal slippages that occurred in late-2005. Most Directors called for a
front-loaded tightening in 2006 through a reversal of the recent fiscal slippages to facilitate rapid
progress toward a sustainable medium-term fiscal position. They also pointed out that costly
implicit subsidies on petroleum products that benefited primarily higher-income households
were growing rapidly, and encouraged the authorities to reflect these subsidies fully in the
government budget, and embark on a gradual adjustment of retail prices toward import parity
levels with well-targeted assistance to the poor. Some Directors saw merit in a more gradual
approach to fiscal adjustment, but emphasized the need to maintain discipline and keep the
non-oil deficit on a declining path.
Directors underlined the importance of strengthening public expenditure management to avoid a
recurrence of unplanned spending and raise the quality of public investment. In this context,
they urged the authorities to implement the recommendations of the recent fiscal transparency
ROSC as soon as possible, including a more effective prioritization of the public investment
program, strengthening budget execution and monitoring, improving the transparency of the
budget—notably of oil revenue—and enhancing the efficiency of the tax system by broadening
the non-oil revenue base. Directors also called for an urgent agreement among CEMAC
(Communauté Économique et Monétaire de l’Afrique Centrale) stakeholders on an appropriate
level of remuneration of international reserves.

-3–
Directors commended the authorities for their Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper,
which represents an important step toward promoting economic diversification and reducing
poverty. They underscored the need to make the strategy operational by formulating concrete
poverty-reducing programs and to accelerate the structural reform agenda to stimulate higher
growth. In this context, Directors emphasized the importance of improving the investment
climate to foster private sector development, pointing to the need to address legal and
regulatory uncertainty, rigid labor markets, and continued weaknesses in governance. Directors
also noted that economic diversification will require a deepening of financial intermediation and
improved access to financial services, including to micro-financing. They also urged the
authorities to conclude expeditiously the privatization of Air Gabon and Gabon Télécom, which
will contribute to strengthening the productivity of Gabon’s economy. Directors underscored that
it will be important to ensure that the successor airline to Air Gabon no longer represents a drain
on public resources.
Directors welcomed the progress made in strengthening governance and increasing
transparency, notably through the publication of Gabon’s first Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (EITI) report. At the same time, they emphasized that there remains
substantial scope for further progress. Directors attached particular importance to improving
access to information, including through the regular publication of timely and accurate economic
statistics and the broader dissemination of government reports. They underscored that the work
of the National Commission Against Illicit Enrichment should be accelerated, including in the
area of investigations. Directors also considered that work on the EITI needs to continue, with
the objective of making the next report more comprehensive. They encouraged the authorities
to resume reforms in the forestry sector, notably by ensuring that its financing remains within
the government budget and dealing decisively with the holders of forestry permits that have tax
arrears.
Directors noted that further trade liberalization would contribute to improving Gabon’s
competitiveness and result in welfare gains. They urged the authorities to take a lead role in
regional discussions within the CEMAC to foster progress in this area, notably in the reduction
of the relatively high common external tariff.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or countries)
concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with member
countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex
post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after
Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board
in a particular case.

Statement by Damian Ondo Mañe, Executive Director for Gabon
June 5, 2006
On behalf of my Gabonese authorities, I would like to thank staff for the constructive policy
discussions and for their set of papers, in particular the Selected Issues Paper which provides
useful analysis of topical issues and can make a valuable contribution to the on-going
discussions within the country. My authorities very much appreciated the presentations of
staff’s findings in Libreville during the mission, as they enabled an useful exchange of views.
We have noted that the staff report features an innovative introduction of “issues for
discussion”, which I think can be helpful in gathering Directors’ guidance on the main issues.
However, we are of the view that the new feature should present issues of importance not
only for the staff but also for the authorities. In the case of Gabon, the issue of whether
spending or saving oil windfall is important for my authorities and is well highlighted.
We would like, at the outset, to note that my Gabonese authorities have embarked, since mid2002, on a fiscal adjustment and reform program, with Fund support, aimed at coping with
the depletion of the oil reserves, and the deterioration of social indicators. These efforts are
bearing fruits as macroeconomic stability has been restored and far-reaching reforms were
completed, as was recognized by Directors during Board meetings on Gabon since 2002. My
authorities would agree that the high level of oil prices since 2004 has favored the
implementation of this program. In particular, the windfall revenue made possible the
elimination of external debt arrears, and enabled the saving of resources for future
generations. In addition, the high oil prices has boosted oil exploration and development of
marginal oil fields, which led to the stabilization of the oil production over the past three
years. However, my authorities are aware that the high level of oil prices are temporary, and
that they will need to pursue steadily their fiscal adjustment efforts. In addition, they consider
that there is still a long way to go as regards the improvement of the living conditions of most
of the population. Accordingly, they will continue to implement policies towards increasing
growth, raising the competitiveness of the economy, reducing the cost of doing business in
Gabon, diversifying the economy and reducing poverty.
The government has already adopted a growth and poverty reduction strategy paper
(DSCRP), which should permit the implementation of programs and structural reforms that
create wealth and employment, by developing sectors other than oil to accelerate the growth
of the national economy. Although my authorities recognize that this document still needs
some improvement, they are of the view that it can serve as an anchor for policy
implementation over the medium-term.
Recent Economic Developments
Economic performance in Gabon has been better than expected in 2005 with real economic
growth of 3 percent, low inflation and large fiscal and external surpluses. While
developments in the oil sector helped achieve this performance, the non-oil sector also
contributed with an impressive 4½ percent growth in 2005 thanks to better performance in

-2timber processing, manganese production and the services sector. As a result, GDP per capita
rose for the first-time in five years. Continued high oil prices led to sizeable balance of
payments surplus that allowed for a further reduction in external debt to 39 percent of GDP
in 2005.
On the fiscal front, while oil revenue increased in line with oil prices, non oil revenue fell
short of the objective by about 1½ percent of non-oil GDP, reflecting in particular lower
recovery of tax arrears and a larger impact of personal income tax exemptions than originally
anticipated. In addition, expenditures exceeded the supplementary budget by 3½ percent of
non-oil GDP on account of higher outlays, including unforeseen security-related spending
that occurred in November 2005, to ensure that elections take place in a safe environment. As
a result, the non-oil primary deficit reached 12 percent of non oil GDP, compared with a
target 8½ percent in the government’s supplementary budget. Despite these slippages, the
government managed to save half of additional oil revenues in 2005.
After some delays, implementation of structural reform measures accelerated in December
2005 in various sectors. Regarding the privatization process, the timetable established in
October 2005 for the sale of 51% of the Gabon Telecom is on track. The tender has been
launched in December 2005 and the selection of bidder is expected in July this year. The
government is restructuring the postal company, which has been an important drain of the
fiscal resources since 2003. The government announced the liquidation of the national airline
company Air Gabon in February 2006, and the creation of a new airline company Air Gabon
International with Royal Air Maroc (RAM) as a partner holding a majority stake. In the
forestry sector, the restructuring undertaken by the new management of the Société Nationale
des Bois du Gabon (SNBG) is bearing fruit with the company recording profits in 2005. The
elimination of the monopoly of the SNBG appears not to have affected the profitability of the
enterprise.
On transparency, Gabon published its first report under the EITI in December. This report
compares 2004 payments reported by oil companies with receipts reported by the
government. Despite a small discrepancy, which my authorities are in the process of
examining, the Independent Administrator of the EITI process finds no evidence of serious
anomalies. For statistical reasons, the profit oil has not been included in the coverage of this
report. For the next report, my authorities intend not only to broaden the coverage to include
profit oil but also to extend the initiative to the mining sector.
Policies over the Medium-Term
Over the medium term, my authorities remain committed to implementing sound policies that
will help achieve their social and economic objectives along the four pillars of the DSCRP
that are (i) raising growth as a prerequisite for poverty reduction, (ii) improving
infrastructure, (iii) improving access to essential services and (iv) strengthening governance.
In that context, policies in 2006 are aimed at restoring fiscal discipline and maintaining the
momentum of reforms to improve the business climate and promote private sector
development, while addressing pressing socio-economic needs. It is my authorities’ intention

-3to request Fund support for their adjustment program under a multi-year arrangement.
Discussions on which are expected to start soon with staff.
There is broad agreement that fiscal policy has to be tightened, and that measures will have
to be taken to put the public finances on a permanently sustainable basis, especially in view
of the fact that the country faces declining revenue from oil over the medium- to long-term.
However, it should be pointed out that given the large social and infrastructure needs of the
country, a right balance has to be struck between satisfying those needs and the speed of
adjustment. Accordingly, my authorities are of the view that the fiscal adjustment process
should be more gradual. In this context, they envisage a three-year span to reverse fully the
slippages that occurred in 2005 and achieve fiscal sustainability. The DCSRP has generated
high expectations and the proposed gradual, but front-loaded adjustment pace is a reflection
of higher spending in infrastructure, health and education to satisfy these social demands, as
set out in the DSCRP. At the same time, my authorities view these investments in the health
and education sectors and infrastructure as strengthening the economic foundations of the
country and contributing to raising the growth potential of the country.
For 2006, measures are being taken that should help to reduce the non-oil primary deficit
from 12 percent of non-oil GDP in 2005 to 9 percent in 2006.
My authorities will continue their prudent use of the oil windfall. Part of this windfall will
be used to finance spending related to the DSCRP, with the remainder being saved. My
authorities are not opposed to the suggestion of using the oil windfall for debt reduction, but
they are looking at all the options and intend to use the oil revenue windfall most effectively.
Despite the slippages last year, control of expenditure has improved over the last years,
especially since the creation of the department of public procurement. In the context of
improving governance and transparency, several audits have been launched whose reports
have highlighted weaknesses in public expenditure management. In light of the findings of
these reports and the recommendations of the recently completed 2006 fiscal ROSC, the
authorities will develop an action plan to strengthen the public financial management. In the
short-term, they will focus on improving efficiency of certain capital outlays, including those
related to Independence Day spending for 2006 and 2007. On this issue, it is to be noted that
Independence Day is celebrated each year in a different region, and the government takes this
opportunity to undertake infrastructure and social spending in that region. In addition, my
authorities will continue to reduce unnecessary current expenditures.
On the implicit petroleum subsidies, my Gabonese authorities acknowledge that they need
to be addressed. They appreciate the analysis from the staff on the issue, especially the
finding that the subsidies are benefiting primarily the wealthiest. They are considering ways
not only to reduce the subsidies but also to better target the poor population.
On fiscal reforms, efforts will continue with regard to the reform of the tax and customs
administration, with the view to increase non-oil revenues. In this context, a thorough update
of the tax code has been completed. The updated tax code now integrates the various changes
in the tax code that have occurred over time and will ensure the overall consistency of the tax

-4legislation and structure. It will be circulated to technical administration for comments before
being officially presented to the government for approval. In the same vein, the LTU is
expected to start its operations later this year as the training of new personnel is completed.
My authorities would, however, highlight the fact that these important reforms will not
translate into higher non oil revenues in the short-term as some time will be needed for them
to become effective.
My authorities fully share the staff’s assessment on the financial sector, in particular
regarding the issue of credit access. They would like to point out that this particular issue has
been repeatedly raised by SMEs and individual entrepreneurs during the DSCRP consultative
process throughout the country and further highlighted in the World bank’s FIAS report on
the business environment in Gabon. Efforts to promote the microfinance will be pursued to
allow low income people to have access to credit. They are studying ways for the FODEX
(Fund for the Development and Expansion of SMEs) to extend its operations to
microfinancing. They took a decisive action in this regard in removing and jailing the
management of this institution for embezzlement. On the declining trend in the private sector
credit, banks usually flag the absence of bankable projects and the difficulties to recover
assets. Nevertheless, my authorities also note that this decline could also reflect strengthened
domestic debt management by the government, which helped improve liquidity situation in
enterprises, and hence limit their recourse to banks for cash management purposes.
On other structural reforms, my authorities are confident that the privatization of Gabon
Telecom will be completed on time during the third quarter of this year. Regarding the new
airline company Air Gabon International, my authorities reiterate that it will be managed on a
fully commercial basis. My authorities will reinvigorate the reform in the forestry sector.
My authorities will continue their efforts to strengthen governance and transparency in
order to improve accountability and the business climate. In particular, publication of key
documents and reports including that of the EITI is increasing.
Conclusion
My Gabonese authorities are strongly committed to the adjustment process and determined to
restructure the economy, and to make it less oil-dependent. However, as I indicated in
previous meetings, these are long-lasting efforts, which require the assistance of the
international community. My authorities still believe that a multi-year arrangement with the
Fund is the best framework to consolidate the gains and maintain the momentum of reforms
in the country. They welcome the negotiations on such an arrangement in the coming weeks.
