IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Canada
On June 6, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Canada. The consultation was focused on assessing the macrofinancial impact of the oil shock and policies to bolster near-term domestic demand, mitigate
downside risks, and position Canada for long-term growth.
The persistent oil shock remains a major test of Canada’s economic and financial resilience since
the 2008 global financial crisis. After several years of solid performance, Canada’s growth
decelerated in 2015, as energy companies slashed investment spending in response to the decline
in oil prices. With rising slack in the economy, the negative output gap widened and financial
vulnerabilities have become more apparent, as reflected in rising loan delinquencies, albeit from
low levels. More broadly, the weaker economy has reignited concerns about the elevated level of
household debt and divergent trends in house prices, which are rapidly rising in Vancouver and
Toronto and falling in Alberta. The slowdown in the economy has also weakened public
finances, with performance at the provincial level diverging along the lines of their resource
dependence.
Growth is expected to rebound in 2016, supported by exchange rate depreciation and
accommodative monetary and fiscal policies, but uncertainty about oil prices, challenges in
sustaining the global recovery, and elevated domestic vulnerabilities suggest risks to the outlook
are tilted to the downside. Therefore, the near-term policy challenge is to pursue an appropriate
policy mix that is supportive of growth while containing vulnerabilities in the housing market,
while in the longer run, the aim should be to make the best use of the available fiscal space to
accelerate structural reform and diversify Canada’s future sources of growth.
Pursuing greater balance in the policy mix will also help reduce risk taking in a low interest rate
environment and discourage households from taking on more debt. Macroprudential policy can
be further tightened if imbalances in the housing market threaten to intensify. Enhancing

financial sector resilience is critical given considerable macro-financial linkages and housing
market vulnerabilities.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities for responding proactively to cushion the impact
of the oil shock on the economy and the financial system. Although growth has slowed
significantly, and the external position weakened moderately in response to lower oil prices, the
Canadian economy has coped well and is projected to recover gradually, with strong
fundamentals and a flexible exchange rate facilitating the adjustment. At the same time,
Directors cautioned that the macro-financial effects of the oil shock have yet to fully play out,
and the balance of risks is tilted to the downside, requiring continued vigilance and a supportive
policy mix.
Directors agreed that monetary and fiscal policy should work together to support the economy.
They concurred on the need to maintain an accommodative monetary stance and for an active
role for fiscal policy. In this context, they welcomed the authorities’ pro-growth budget, and
noted that additional fiscal easing should be considered if risks materialize. They also
recommended that provinces with high debt or a deficit should undertake fiscal consolidation at a
gradual pace so as not to offset federal government stimulus.
Directors highlighted the importance of strengthening the medium-term framework to bolster
credibility. They welcomed the authorities’ commitment to putting the debt-to-GDP ratio on a
downward path. Directors noted that a new rule that is transparent, easy to communicate, and
sufficiently flexible to avoid pro-cyclicality would help anchor fiscal sustainability and sustain
market confidence. A few Directors cautioned against premature introduction of a fiscal rule
until growth is forecast to remain on a sustainably high track.
Directors agreed that the long-term policy challenge is to make the best use of fiscal space to
accelerate structural reform, catalyze private investment, and diversify Canada’s future sources
of growth. Close collaboration between the federal and provincial governments is needed to push
the agenda forward and ensure efficient implementation. A nationwide infrastructure plan would
help raise the quality of infrastructure investment. More broadly, a multi-pronged approach with
emphasis on innovation and investment in the labor force is needed to improve productivity and
external competitiveness.
Directors noted that Canada’s financial sector continues to be sound and stable. They agreed that
macroprudential measures have been broadly effective in containing the growth of mortgage

credit and suggested that these could be further tightened if imbalances in the housing market
threaten to intensify. Directors also acknowledged that prudential policies have strengthened
banks’ balance sheets and helped ensure system stability. They welcomed the progress made in
implementing several recommendations of the 2014 Financial Sector Assessment Program
Update, including the establishment of the new Capital Markets Authority, and encouraged the
authorities to make further improvements where needed. They took note of the authorities’
assessment that the framework for macroprudential oversight achieves the objective of
safeguarding financial sector stability, and looked forward to the planned financial sector review.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to remain actively engaged in discussions with
international partners related to correspondent banking relationships in the Caribbean.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
May 20, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context: After several years of solid growth, real GDP growth decelerated to 1.2 percent
in 2015, as energy companies slashed investment spending in response to the decline in
oil prices. Growth is expected to rebound in 2016, supported by exchange rate
depreciation and accommodative monetary and fiscal policies, but uncertainty about oil
prices, challenges in sustaining the global recovery, and elevated domestic vulnerabilities
suggest risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. A new government, led by Prime
Minister Trudeau, took office in late 2015.
Strategy: The 2016 Canada Article IV consultation was focused on assessing the macrofinancial impact of the oil shock and policies to bolster near-term domestic demand,
mitigate downside risks, and position Canada for long-term growth.
Key policy recommendations:


Monetary policy should stay accommodative, and further easing should be considered if
the economy slows. It should not, however, solely bear the burden of supporting the
economy given potential financial stability risks associated with a low interest rate
environment.



Fiscal policy should be pro-growth. The federal government has fiscal space and its plans
to increase infrastructure spending in the 2016 Budget are appropriate. There is merit in
and room for providing further fiscal support if downside risks materialize and the
economy falters. Medium-term sustainability anchors should be strengthened to
underscore fiscal credibility.



Macroprudential policy has been broadly effective in alleviating financial stability risks
and reducing tax payer exposure to mortgage finance. Additional macroprudential
measures may be needed if housing market vulnerabilities intensify.



Despite important progress, concerted efforts are needed to address several major
recommendations that remain outstanding from the 2014 Financial Sector Assessment
Program.



Greater emphasis should be placed on structural reforms to boost productivity and
external competitiveness to facilitate the transition to a more diversified economy.

In a pro-active move to insure against falling prices
and slowing growth, the Bank of Canada (BOC) cut the policy rate twice in 2015. The economy
recovered in the second half of 2015 and is likely to gain strength in 2016, but the complex
adjustment to lower oil prices continue to weigh on the near-term outlook.

Slowing growth in 2015 reflected:


Substantially weaker business investment, as oil
companies cut investment spending by
40 percent in the face of declining profits.
Canadian oil sands producers have high “all-in
break-even” costs and their long-term viability
is at stake. Those companies involved in
upstream activities, in particular, face higher
solvency risk and difficulties in raising new
financing. The market for high yield debt has
been frozen since early 2015 and banks have
become more cautious in extending credit.



A slowdown in private consumption, owing to the impact of the oil shock on employment
and house prices in resource-rich provinces. For the country as a whole, growth in real
disposable income declined and in early 2016 consumer sentiment with respect to making
big-ticket purchases, like a home or a car, fell to its worst level since the 2008–09 recession.



An uninspiring performance of non-energy exports, which grew well below what would have
been expected given the more competitive Canadian dollar and recovery in the U.S. This
reflects the erosion of manufacturing capacity during the oil boom years (2002–12), when the
real effective exchange rate appreciated by 57 percent, and Canada lost market share in the
U.S. (75 percent of Canada’s exports go to the United States) to Mexico and China. Weak
external demand, beyond the nascent U.S. recovery, was also a factor.

4.
With the slowdown in growth, the output
gap has re-opened. The output gap narrowed from
over 3½ percent of GDP in 2009 to almost zero in
2014. However, with rising slack in the economy, the
output gap widened to 1 percent of GDP at the end of
2015. The latest Business Outlook Survey indicates the
incidence of labor shortages remains low and the
share of involuntary part-time workers remains
elevated at 4.5 percent of the labor force. There are no
signs of wage pressures.

So far in 2016, economic performance has been mixed. While better than expected

they have since slowed suggesting that the growth momentum is unlikely to be sustained in the

The banking system remains sound but exposure to the oil and gas sector will
require higher provisions against expected losses (Figure 4 and Table 6). Canada’s banking
system is dominated by six banks accounting

Tier 1 ratios rising above 10 percent, while
non-performing loans (NPLs) remain below ½ percent. The banks’ mortgage book is also
secured by government guarantees on high risk mortgage loans (those with loan-to-value (LTV)
ratios above 80 percent) some of which are pooled to raise financing in the securitization market.
Insured mortgage loans account for 50 percent of banks’ mortgage loan portfolio. In terms of
these banks’ exposure to the oil and gas sector:


Direct lending is limited to 2 percent of total loans on average, with another 2 percent in
undrawn credit lines, but the indirect exposure through household and business lending in
resource-rich provinces is a more substantial 13–15 percent.



Credit quality has deteriorated since 2014. Oil companies’ stock prices have fallen by
35 percent, their operating margin has declined by almost 15 percentage points, and their
median probability of default has increased sharply (Box 2).



Loan delinquencies are gradually rising, albeit from low levels. Liquidity constrained
companies are struggling to find buyers for their assets, as a result of a substantial decline in
mergers and acquisitions activity. Banks are reviewing covenant breaches as part of their
“borrowing base re-determination” and may be forced to take provisions for higher credit

It is too early to assess the impact on growth of the Fort McMurray fires. Reconstruction efforts are likely to
offset the negative impact on oil production and economic activity. Media reports also suggest that most of the
oil sands facilities were not damaged.

The data is taken from the 2014 IMF Financial Sector Assessment Program. There are a few large provinciallyregulated deposit takers with assets equivalent to 5 percent of banking sector assets. The big six banks account
for 39 percent of total financial system assets.

losses.3 Overall, the estimated increase in provisions is likely to be substantial, but it is from a
low base, and will thus hit banks’ earnings rather than capital.4


The gradual increase in the overall NPL ratio probably reflects the cushion provided by
severance packages, which could last more than a year, and the extension of unemployment
benefits provided in the 2016 Budget. So far, the number of insolvencies filed by consumers
in Alberta has increased by almost 40 percent from a year ago (Figure 5).

7.
More broadly, vulnerabilities in the financial system are rising in the context of the
oil shock and elevated household debt. With an economy weakened by the oil shock and
historically high household debt (165 percent of disposable income), vulnerabilities in the
housing market have increased (Figure 5). Low interest Canada: House Prices Deviation from Fundamentals

are important reasons for heightened vigilance:



Although house prices in Alberta and other resource
provinces are declining, they are rapidly rising in
British Columbia and Ontario (Box 3 and Table 7).
Staff estimates national house prices to be about
10–30 percent above their fundamental values.
The proportion of debt held by highly indebted
households (those with debt to income of 350
percent or more) has risen from 13 percent to
21 percent. The bulk of this debt is mortgages held
by younger and low- to middle-income
households, who have fewer savings to cushion an
employment shock in an economic downturn.
The business and housing cycles are beginning to
diverge, and while the gap is smaller than during
2008–09, it is occurring in the context of much
higher household debt. The BOC estimates that
higher debt, under a stress scenario, leads to
27 percent greater mortgage loan arrears after
three years.5

Canadian banks are subject to IAS 39 accounting rules which means provisions are taken only if losses have
been incurred. Canada will move to IFRS9 in 2018 which will require more timely recognition of expected losses.
The BOC’s stress scenario assumes that (i) the unemployment rate will rise by three percentage points; and (ii)
the household borrowing rate will rise by 200 basis points, with both staying at this elevated level for three years.

Every spring and fall the Canadian banks review the credit lines to their corporate customers to determine
whether these should be changed to reflect changing credit conditions. As a result of the reviews, banks may
increase or decrease credit lines and change loan covenants. In the case of energy companies, an important part
of the review is to value the underlying collateral (especially oil in the ground), as well as inventory, machinery
and equipment.

Box 2. Canada: Bank Exposure to Solvency Risk of Oil and Gas Sector
The solvency risk of the Canadian corporate sector, and specifically of oil and gas companies, is estimated
using a new corporate default database and a Bottom-up Default Analysis (BuDA) tool developed by Duan
et al (2015). BuDA forecasts the median probability of default (PD) by incorporating economy-wide effects,
firm-specific balance sheet information, and market-based factors. The model is estimated directly with
default and other exit data for the U.S. and Canada. Staff prefers to use the BuDA model to assess
corporate solvency risk since the default database and calibration methodology is made available and such
hybrid models add predictive power to the pure contingent claims approach derived from the Merton
(1973, 1974) model. With the projected PDs, the impact of higher credit risk on bank balance sheets can be
assessed using the one-factor Vasicek (1991) model. Higher PDs require banks to raise new provisions to
cushion against higher expected losses.

corporate sector are, however, projected to rise to only 0.3 percent, indicating limited spillover from the oil
to the non-oil sector.

BuDA versus Moody’s Expected Default Frequency (EDF)
Market analysts typically use Moody’s EDFs to assess risks in individual sectors of the economy. For roughly
the same sample of 70 companies involved in oil exploration and production (as used in BuDA), Moody’s
EDF suggests an increase in the median 12-month EDF to an average of 4.5 percent in the first half of 2016,
which is larger than projected by BuDA. The

Impact on provisions

Sources: IMF staff estimates based on BuDA.

As an illustrative scenario, the projected increase in BuDA PDs suggests that banks may need to at least
double provisions against energy loans compared to the average 2015 level. Given the level of provisions at
end-2015, the potential impact on earnings could range between 1 to 3 percent of annual net income,
therefore leaving capital unaffected.

The slowdown in the economy has weakened public finances, with performance at
the provincial level diverging along the lines of their resource dependence. In recent years,
both the federal and provincial governments have undertaken consolidation measures enabling a
narrowing of the general government overall deficit from 4¾ percent of GDP in 2010 to
0.5 percent of GDP in 2014 (Table 5). This was undone by the oil shock, however, and the general
government deficit widened again to 1.7 percent in 2015.


The federal government delivered a surplus (¼ percent of GDP) in 2014 (the first time since
2008), but slipped into a small deficit (¼ percent of GDP) in 2015. Revenue collections
performed as expected, with solid personal income and corporate tax revenues, but were
offset by higher than expected spending on most expenditure categories.



Alberta has been hit hard by the lower oil price, due to its heavy dependence on oil royalty
revenues (20 percent of total revenues in 2014), and is expecting an operational deficit of
2¾ percent of GDP in FY2015–16 after two consecutive years of surpluses.6 In contrast,
British Columbia and Quebec are expected to maintain operational balance, and Ontario is
expected to narrow its operational deficit to 2 percent in FY2015–16, on the back of buoyant
revenues and cuts in public wages and administrative costs.

The operational balance numbers are based on provincial accounting that exclude capital spending.

demand policies would help facilitate the structural adjustment and make structural reforms that
have upfront costs more palatable. Staff assumes a smooth transition that will enable Canada to
take advantage of shifting global trade patterns and raise potential growth to about 2 percent in
the medium term, which is still lower than the annual average of 2¼ percent over the past
15 years (Table 4).

B. Risks
12.

Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside (Risk Assessment Matrix and Box 5).



Persistently low energy prices pose an important risk to the economy. Oil companies have
already cut cost significantly. A protracted period of low oil prices could force some firms to
permanently shut down production, as room for generating additional cost savings or
productivity gains would be limited. This would trigger second round effects on investment
and growth, as banks shed bad loans and curtail lending. Over the long term, deep industry
cutbacks on investment will affect the ability of the oil industry to ramp up production once
oil markets start to rebalance.



Higher uncertainty about global growth prospects and a lack of effective policy response to
offset headwinds could lead to persistent weakness in global trade and investment. The U.S.
economy is Canada’s dominant trading partner, but other economies (Asia and Europe) are
still important export markets.



Spillovers from China to Canada would mostly be felt through a slowdown in trade9 and
weaker commodity prices since there is little direct exposure of Canadian banks to China.
According to BOC estimates, if Chinese growth slows by one percentage point Canadian
growth would slip one-tenth of a percentage point. 10 By comparison, if the same decline
happened to the U.S., the impact on Canada's GDP would be six times greater.11



Tighter global financial conditions due to higher risk aversion and pressure on banks in
Europe, or a significant and sudden depreciation of the renminbi could be disruptive to the
global financial system, with implications for financial conditions in Canada. A disorderly U.S.
monetary policy normalization could also raise Canada’s long-term government bond yields

9

China accounts for 17 percent of Canada’s total trade and 4 percent of Canada’s exports.

10

China accounts for roughly 7 percent of U.S. exports of value added. IMF staff analysis suggests that a
1 percentage point investment-driven drop in China’s output growth would reduce Group of Twenty (G20)
growth by ¼ percentage point (Chapter 1, April 2016 WEO).

as they have generally moved in line with those in the U.S.12 Shorter yields are likely to rise by
less, reflecting perceived differences in monetary policy prospects.


The key domestic risk is a sharp correction in the housing market. A severe recession that
triggers a sharp rise in the unemployment rate could destabilize housing markets, setting off
adverse feedback loops in the economy, and leading to greater financial stability risks.13
Given extensive government-backed mortgage insurance, the impact of a severe housing
downturn on the federal fiscal position could be considerable and potentially limit the room
for fiscal stimulus down the road (Annex III).



In a tail risk scenario, all these risks could occur concurrently and intertwine, aggravating
macro-financial spillover channels. The probability of such an event occurring is low, but the
impact obviously would be very significant. The stress tests of the 2014 FSAP show that the
banking system would be able to withstand a major recession scenario that includes a
50 percent drop in oil prices, an increase in the unemployment rate to a peak of 13.2 percent,
and a 34 percent decline over 3 years (22 percent in the first year) in house prices. All banks
would fall below the supervisory threshold, but the recapitalization needs would be
manageable. Furthermore, since the time of the FSAP, banks have improved their capital
position. Finally, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) and the private
mortgage insurers own earnings and loss absorption capacity provide another layer of
cushion between losses on mortgage insurance and the fiscal impact on the government.

13.
There is also upside potential to the medium-term outlook. A better than expected
recovery in Canadian exports would strengthen business investment and facilitate a faster
reallocation of resources from the energy to the non-energy sectors.
14.
Furthermore, Canada’s strong fundamentals will help mitigate the impact if
downside risks materialize. Canada has strong institutions and a track record of consistent
policies. Its growth performance has been among the strongest in major advanced economies
post-2008. Furthermore, despite rising short-term external debt, Canada enjoys a positive net
international investment position because it owns substantial assets overseas. This provides a
natural hedge to currency risk on aggregate debt. Its flexible exchange rate is also an important
shock absorber.

12

However, an increase in U.S. interest rates predicated on higher growth and inflation in the U.S., could actually
be positive for Canada. The depreciation of the Canadian dollar and higher U.S. domestic demand would boost
non-energy exports. All else equal, the Canadian dollar price of oil would also increase as the U.S. dollar
appreciates, which would then imply an increase in the value of Canada’s oil exports.
Households are also susceptive to interest rate risks, as about 40 percent of mortgage loans are with variable
rates. However, to mitigate this vulnerability, banks require borrowers to qualify for their mortgages at a rate that
is the greater of the contractual mortgage rate or the five-year benchmark rate published by the Bank of Canada
when taking out a variable-rate mortgage or a mortgage with a fixed term of less than 5 years.

C. Spillovers
15.






There are potential outward spillovers from Canada to the Caribbean.
Canadian banks have had a long historical
connection to the region, but low returns and bad
debts have led to banks scaling back operations,
including closing branches. A materialization of
downside risks could exacerbate Canadian banks’
ongoing rationalization of their operations in the
region. Tourism revenues may also suffer as
Canada is a major source of tourist traffic to the
region, second only to the U.S.
A recent World Bank perception survey of
correspondent banking relationships (CBRs)
indicated pressure on CBRs of local/regional banks
in the Caribbean, but did not indicate any material
reduction in Canadian banks’ CBRs in the region.
The Office of the Superintendent of Financial
Institutions (OSFI) does not at present collect data
on this trend. While it is challenging to gather
reliable and conclusive evidence of withdrawal of
CBRs, OSFI should take steps to actively monitor
the trends in CBRs provided by Canadian banks.

Canadian banks are choosing not to step into the
gap left behind by retreating global banks, partly because higher regulatory compliance
costs have made the risk-reward equation challenging. In this context, Canadian banks are
looking for greater clarity in national and international standards, including with respect to
regulations to counter money laundering and offshore tax evasion and avoidance (Box 4).

probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The matrix reflects staff
views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Nonmutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Box 4. Canada: Correspondent Banking Relationships with the Caribbean
A long history. Canadian banks have been in the Caribbean since the 19th century, when Royal Bank of
Canada (as Merchants Bank of Halifax) and Scotiabank first set up shop in Bermuda and Jamaica. Today, the
two banks and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce have numerous branches spread across the
archipelago and account for 75–80 percent of all banking assets in Barbados, Grenada and the Bahamas, and
60 percent of the assets of the ECCU banking system. Scotiabank has the largest footprint with C$32 billion
in total loans to the region.
Recent trends. Global banks have recently been terminating or restricting their corresponding banking
relationships (CBRs) with local/regional banks across the world. In particular, the Caribbean has been
potentially affected by declining CBRs, with even central banks not being immune. While it has been
challenging to gather conclusive data on these trends, a recent World Bank perception survey1 indicated
pressure on CBRs of local/regional banks in the Caribbean. The potential drivers behind the withdrawal of
CBRs are multiple and may relate to business strategy and/or cost/benefit analysis, including in the context
of implementation of regulatory obligations, such as capital and liquidity rules, AML/CFT, economic and
trade sanctions, and tax transparency. In some instances, withdrawals of CBRs can result from unclear, poorly
communicated, or conflicting regulatory expectations. So far, there is no evidence of a macroeconomic
impact from the withdrawals of CBRs, and it seems most institutions have found replacements for lost CBRs
with varying degrees of difficulty. Concerns have been expressed that pressure from withdrawal of CBRs may
be leading to higher costs for remittances and related services, but supporting evidence is still lacking.
Risk-reward equation. While Canadian banks have no immediate plans to significantly cut CBRs, they are
taking a hard look at the risk-return tradeoffs. On the one hand, the cost of regulatory compliance has
increased, notably as U.S. regulators have taken a more concerted approach to enforcing AML/CFT
regulations and bilateral initiatives like the 2010 U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act to combat tax
evasion. On the other hand, Caribbean consumer businesses have low profit margins and the target
consumer population in the region could not bear higher fees, so boosting profit margins through the repricing of bank services is not a feasible option. At the present time, Canadian banks see little scope for
expanding their presence to fill the gap left by retreating global banks.

decline in oil prices matter
for Canada’s medium-term
economic outlook.
If only supply factors
were at play, Canada’s
GDP level would be
lower by 0.5 percent
compared to 2014
projections. In this case,
the positive impact on
the global economy and
the U.S. economy in
particular, accrue over
time and generate
demand for Canadian
exports, which partially
offsets the negative
effects on investment
and consumption from
lower oil prices.

Box 5. Canada: The Estimated Impact of Lower Oil Prices and Risk Scenarios (concluded)
The transmission effects work as follows: similar to Scenario 1, lower oil prices would significantly reduce
investment and weaker domestic income would lower private consumption. However, the decline in global
aggregate demand added to Scenario 2 (represented by the red-shaded share of the fall in oil prices in the
Chart above) would weigh on Canada’s exports. As a result, under Scenario 2, global aggregate demand
would not be able to offset the negative effects on investment and consumption from lower oil prices.


Changes in the oil price caused by improvements in energy efficiency are estimated to have a small effect
on Canada’s GDP.

Risk scenarios
Four scenarios are considered, drawing on the G20MOD simulation exercises elaborated in recent WEOs. In
the first scenario, lower-than-expected private investment and higher-than-expected private saving lead to
secular stagnation and weaker domestic demand in advanced economies (AEs). In the second scenario,

POLICY CHALLENGES
The policy mix over the near-term should cushion the adverse effects of lower oil prices on the
economy while safeguarding financial stability. If downside risks materialize, there is scope for both
monetary and fiscal policy to provide additional stimulus to the economy, even as macroprudential
measures are stepped up to mitigate potential financial stability risks. With accommodative policies
in place, the timing is right for a renewed push on structural reform to position Canada in the long
term for new growth opportunities (for traction of past Fund advice, see Annex I).

A. Monetary Policy
16.
The current monetary policy stance is appropriate. The BOC should stand ready to cut
the policy rate if downside risks materialize and the economy falters. However, with the policy
rate at 0.5 percent, the room for additional cuts is limited (Figure 7).
17.
It would be appropriate to seek recourse to unconventional monetary policy
measures in the event that the economy slows significantly and deflationary risks emerge,
but clear communication would be critical. Staff welcomes the BOC’s recently updated
framework for unconventional monetary policy, which includes forward guidance, large-scale
asset purchases, negative interest rates, and funding for credit (Annex IV). The BOC is not
committed to any specific order in which these policy measures will be used. Staff agrees that the
efficacy of each measure will depend on the economic and financial context and, in some cases,
the measures could be mutually reinforcing when used in combination. In the event
unconventional monetary policy measures are put to use, the BOC should communicate clearly
its diagnosis of the problem and the merits as well as the transmission channels of the measures
it plans to pursue.
18.
Monetary policy is a blunt tool to address housing market vulnerabilities and
macroprudential policy should remain the first line of defense in safeguarding financial
stability. The costs of using monetary policy for financial stability objectives, or “leaning against
the wind”, outweigh the benefits, except in circumstances where credit growth is exceptionally
high for an extended period. Hence, macroprudential policy should generally be the first port of
call to address financial stability risks, and this has indeed been the case in Canada. That being
said, the BOC sees a role for monetary policy in financial stability and staff agrees that its risk
management approach to monetary policy appropriately takes into account financial stability
considerations within its flexible inflation targeting framework.

B. Fiscal Policy
19.
The federal government has the fiscal space to support the economy. Canada’s
overall fiscal position remains strong (Table 5). Although the general government’s gross debt is
relatively high at about 90 percent of GDP, the gross debt of the federal government is
considerably lower at 40 percent of GDP. Including financial assets would further reduce the
federal government (net) debt to 23 percent of GDP.

further monetary easing and thus limit the scope
for excessive risk taking in a low interest rate environment. The stimulus package includes
discretionary measures totaling 1¼ percent of GDP spread over FY2016–17 and FY2017–18, more
than 40 percent of which are allocated to mostly shovel-ready infrastructure projects. Staff
estimates that the measures would boost annual growth by ½ percentage point of GDP in each
of the next two fiscal years, based on a conservative fiscal multiplier.15 In line with this, the overall
deficit will increase from ¼ percent of GDP in 2015 to around 1 percent of GDP in 2016 and
2017.

growth impact of the fiscal measures is calculated for each discretionary measure in the text table (with
relatively high multipliers assigned to infrastructure and housing measures, and low multipliers to tax
measures). Staff estimates the average size of the fiscal multiplier is 0.7 for the first year and 0.9 for the total of
the two years. The estimated multipliers are broadly consistent with those for an open economy at a cyclical
downturn position, suggested in IMF’s guidance note on fiscal multipliers (November 2013). Staff’s estimates are
also broadly in the range of estimates calculated by DOF, BOC, and the Parliamentary Budget Officer.

22 percent to 20.5 percent. To cover the loss in tax revenue, the budget includes revenue
enhancing measures, including (i) a hike in the top marginal personal tax rate from
29 percent to 33 percent; (ii) abolishing the tax advantage for couples with children filing tax
returns together; and (iii) strengthening tax compliance.


Increasing public infrastructure investment during periods of economic slack and monetary
policy accommodation could deliver significant growth dividends.16 Given uncertainty about
demand conditions and the highly complementary nature of infrastructure services, it could
help “crowd in” private business investment, which has been weak even before the oil shock.

21.
If the economy takes a turn for the worse, additional fiscal easing should be
considered, for which there is room. The additional fiscal easing should be temporary and
could be achieved by bringing forward planned infrastructure spending or by temporarily cutting
personal and corporate income taxes.
22.
At the provincial level, greater caution is needed. Among the larger provinces,
Quebec has relatively high debt, while Ontario has a relatively high deficit. In these provinces,
fiscal consolidation should proceed, but at a

23.
Strengthening the medium-term fiscal framework will be important to bolster fiscal
credibility. Any stimulus package should be accompanied by a credible medium-term
consolidation plan. Medium-term consolidation will also help improve the external position.


The federal government’s commitment to putting the debt to GDP ratio on a downward path
is appropriate. In this context, the current balanced budget rule, which is too rigid, should be
replaced by a new fiscal rule that is transparent, easy to communicate, and sufficiently
flexible to avoid pro-cyclicality (possible options elaborated in the 2014 Article IV Staff
Report remain valid). The new rule should be embedded in a multi-year fiscal framework that
details measures consistent with the revenue and expenditure projections.

16

In a sample of advanced economies, a 1 percentage point of GDP increase in investment spending increases
the level of output by about 1.5 percent four years after the increase, Chapter 3, October 2014 WEO.

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CANADA



At the provincial level, fiscal rules should be modified to target the overall balance that
includes capital spending, rather than the operational balance. This would clearly establish a
link between deficit and debt targets and enhance the credibility of provinces where debt
reduction is a medium-term fiscal objective (e.g. Quebec and Ontario).

24.
It is essential that the authorities follow through with “Phase 2” of the
infrastructure initiative to achieve productivity goals. This will require close cooperation and
coordination between federal and provincial authorities. The federal government should take the
lead in developing a nation-wide infrastructure plan that identifies infrastructure gaps and
prioritizes projects that enhance the economy’s productive capacity. Priority projects could
include those that reduce urban transportation congestion, and improve and expand trade
corridors. As a first step, a forum to bring together and engage all relevant stakeholders should
be established. Furthermore, new and innovative sources of funding are needed to support the
infrastructure plan to limit the impact on debt at the provincial and municipal level. We welcome
the financing options elaborated in the 2016 Budget that include greater involvement of public
pension plans, user fees, and more creative use of public private partnerships.
25.
As a longer-term reform agenda, the authorities should consider the impact of
escalating health care costs and aging pressures on provincial finances. Fiscal gaps at the
provincial level could emerge and widen over time, with material implications on provincial debt
burdens within a 15–20 year time frame. This puts the onus first and foremost on provinces to
adjust their spending priorities.

Box 6. Canada: New Infrastructure Investment Initiative
In the 2016 Budget, the Federal government announced a new infrastructure plan, totaling $60 billion
(2¼ percent of GDP) over 10 years. The plan will be implemented in two phases. The baseline medium-term
projections incorporate only Phase 1 spending plans.
Phase 1
To address immediate needs and boost shortterm growth, the first phase focuses on shovel
ready infrastructure projects, amounting to
$12 billion over the 2–3 years. The main
objectives of this phase are: (i) to upgrade and
improve public transit; (ii) to modernize water,
and wastewater systems, and address climate
change (“Green Infrastructure”); and (iii) to
provide affordable housing (including for seniors
and the homeless) and to improve housing
conditions in First Nations’ communities (“Social
Infrastructure”).

The government is looking for new
innovative financing arrangements to reduce the cost of infrastructure projects at local government levels. It
is considering actively engaging public pension funds and global institutional investors to take the lead in
planning, building, and operating infrastructure projects but that would still allow the government to be
involved. This would reduce the government’s direct financial costs.

C. Financial Sector Policies
26.
The authorities have been vigilant to housing-related risks, which is the most
significant macro-financial vulnerability for Canada. The federal government, CMHC, and
OSFI have introduced a host of measures over the past several years, including most recently in
December 2015, to reduce risk taking and limit

have a less risky profile, both because of the lower

27.
Nevertheless, further macroprudential measures will be needed if housing sector
vulnerabilities intensify. The mission welcomes OSFI’s initiative to introduce a risk-based floor
for banks’ internal capital models for uninsured mortgages. Beyond this, the authorities could
consider introducing a cap on LTI (loan-to-income). This measure would be superior to debt
service-to-income limits which become less binding in a low interest rate environment. If national

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

CANADA

measures prove inadequate to contain risks, measures that target specific imbalances in regional
housing markets would be warranted.
28.
Government-backed mortgage insurance has played an important countercyclical
role during times of stress, but this benefit needs to be weighed against the potential cost
to taxpayers. Government guarantees of insured mortgages are still a sizable 36 percent of GDP
as of 2015, even though the government receives premium income from CMHC and private
insurers. One option to further reduce the size of the government’s contingent liability is to
narrow the scope of providing government guarantees more strictly to low and middle-income
households.17 Other options to shrink the government’s footprint in the mortgage insurance
space could include lender risk sharing by introducing higher deductibles for insured mortgages,
and further fine-tuning insurance premiums and securitization fees. Nevertheless, any reform
should proceed gradually to preserve the countercyclical role and social objective of facilitating
access to housing finance.
29.
Prudential policies have strengthened
banks’ balance sheets and helped ensure
system stability. OSFI introduced a three percent
leverage ratio in 2015 and a one percent capital
surcharge for domestic systemically important
banks in January 2016. Quebec Authorite des
Marches Financiers also started applying an
equivalent capital surcharge to Desjardins, a large
cooperative credit union. The capital conservation
buffer will be phased in gradually by 2019. On
liquidity, OSFI required banks to fully meet the
Liquidity Coverage Ratio and plans to introduce the Net Stable Funding Ratio by 2018.
Systemically important financial institutions are also required to participate in regular
macroeconomic stress test exercises led by OSFI and the BOC to assess the resilience of the
financial system to systemic shocks.
30.
Important progress has been made in implementing the 2014 FSAP
recommendations (Annex VI). The new Capital Markets Regulatory Authority, which brings
together the federal regulator and six provincial regulators to strengthen Canada’s capacity to
identify and manage systemic risk on a national basis, is a bold step toward enhancing the
cooperation between federal and provincial regulators. Other measures have also been taken to
engage with provincial regulators, including the BOC providing technical assistance on macro
stress testing and model design. Also, CMHC has taken the lead in publishing the results of its
stress test, and the BOC is considering how best to integrate quantitative analysis into its

financial stability assessment presented in the Financial System Review. This would enhance both
the transparency and credibility of financial sector policies.
31.
However, concerted efforts are needed to address several major recommendations
that remain outstanding.


The FSAP called for giving clear regulatory mandates to monitor systemic risk to facilitate
macro-prudential oversight and carry out system-wide crisis preparedness. The Senior
Advisory Committee (SAC) plays these roles on a de facto basis. However, the SAC does not
have a mandate for crisis management nor are the members given an explicit financial
stability mandate for macroprudential oversight.



Furthermore, consistent with Basel Core Principles, legislation should be amended to give
OSFI sole decision-making authority on prudential criteria. It is important for a prudential
authority to make prudential decisions for safety and soundness reasons without the
potential for ministerial discretion. While this has not been a problem in practice, ministerial
power to override supervisory judgment impinges on operational independence, which is a
critical input to supervisory effectiveness.



Finally, the ability to conduct group-wide supervision is a key component of the Insurance
Core principles to promote a consolidated view of risks and prevent arbitrage across
differently regulated structures in the group. Legislation should be amended to give OSFI the
authority to take supervisory measures at the level of the holding company.

D. Structural Reforms
32.
The timing is right for a renewed push on structural reforms to raise Canada’s
productivity growth, which has lagged behind its peers for many decades and eroded its
external competitiveness. The exchange rate depreciation over the last two years has
significantly improved the price competitiveness of Canadian non-energy exports. However, the
past erosion of capacity in the manufacturing sector may not be easily reversed and places
constraints on the pace and extent of export recovery (Box 7, Figure 8, and Appendix 1). Higher
labor productivity growth is necessary to restore capacity in the manufacturing sector and, more
generally, improve Canada’s ability to compete in existing and new export markets. To this end, a
multi-pronged approach to promote innovation and investment in physical and human capital is
needed.
33.
Promoting innovation. Investment in private R&D could generate a significant growth
dividend and makes a strong case for supportive fiscal policy.18 The current fiscal regime gives

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

27

CANADA

generous tax incentives to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) relative to large firms.19
This is because innovation often takes place in small firms but they find it harder to obtain
financing.20 Indeed, between 2010 and 2012, 53 percent of SMEs introduced a product or process
innovation in Canada, a performance that was exceeded only by SMEs in Australia, Germany and
Switzerland.21 While the use of R&D tax incentives has helped promote innovation in SMEs,
subsidizing SMEs based on their size alone may not be optimal:


First, it is usually new rather than small firms that introduce new ideas, business models
and technologies into the marketplace. High start-up rates (firms 0–2 years old) increase
both the likelihood of radical innovation and competitive pressures on incumbents to
innovate and adopt new technologies. Canada today has among the lowest start-up rates
in the OECD.22 Its performance in scaling up start-ups, as indicated by the share of startup microenterprises (1–9 employees) growing into small firms (10–19 employees) after
three years, is also average at 5 percent.



Second, size-based tax preferences can create disincentives for firms to grow larger,
creating a “small business trap”, which contribute less to productivity and employment
growth. About 60 percent of small firms in Canada are more than six years old.



Third, the lack of large innovative firms may have a negative impact on business
innovation in Canada.23 Through their pivotal role in supply chains, these firms can drive
innovation in smaller firms. Their presence is critical to anchor innovation clusters and
can help foster a more deeply engrained innovation culture among other cluster
members. Large firms also have more resources with which to invest, innovate and
export, and they tend to be more productive than small firms.

While fiscal policy can play an important role in promoting innovation, the government should
evaluate R&D subsidy policies to ensure that they are cost effective and simple so as to minimize
compliance costs and facilitate firm entry, and strike an appropriate balance between direct and
indirect support. The overall effective tax rate should not penalize firms from scaling up. In
particular, preferential tax treatment of small firms should be re-considered. Well designed tax

In Canada, small businesses (with employment less than 100 persons) make up 70 percent of total employment
in the private sector (Source: Industry Canada, 2013, Key Small Business Statistics). Tax incentives take the form of
lower corporate tax rates and higher R&D investment tax credit.

relief targeted to new firms can promote entrepreneurship and innovation, as demonstrated by
the successful initiatives in Chile and France.24
34.
Boosting labor force participation and talent base. Although female labor force
participation is fairly high, the current gap (10 percentage points) between male and female
labor force participation should be narrowed. Staff analysis indicates that higher female labor
force participation could have a positive impact on productivity growth, increasing labor supply
at a time when it is stagnant due to demographic reasons. The new Canada Child Benefit is a
step in the right direction in providing benefits to low and middle income families, but could be
better targeted to boost female labor force participation, including providing more generous
child care subsidies for working parents.25
35.
Investment in human capital and skills training. Canada has a highly educated
workforce but more vocational and specialized skills training would help retool the labor force to
facilitate labor mobility to high value added activities and meet the challenges of a changing
global economy. Canada spends about half of the OECD average on publicly funded training,
leaving significant room for improvement.
36.
Investment in physical capital. The federal government’s planned increase in
infrastructure spending will help catalyze private business investment. In addition, lowering
interprovincial barriers to trade as well as policies to promote competition in the network sectors
would create the right conditions to expand domestic business investment and attract FDI.

According to Fortin et al (2012), the child care subsidy program in Quebec introduced in 1997 and gradually
expanded in the following years is an example with strong positive effects on female labor force participation.
The program “paid for itself” as government welfare costs decreased and income taxes increased.

Box 7. Canada: Determinants of Labor Productivity Growth
Canada’s productivity growth has declined from
1.5 percent in the 1970s–80s to less than 1 percent
today. Canada has been trailing the U.S. since the 1970s
but in the 2000s, Canada’s productivity gap with the U.S.
widened to 20 percentage points.1 Only recently has
Canada narrowed the gap with the U.S., but this is more
a reflection of the severity of the 2008-09 financial crisis
in the U.S. than a marked improvement in productivity
growth in Canada. A shift in resources from the energy to
the non-energy sector would result in a temporary drop
in productivity but over time higher productivity growth
in the non-energy sector would lift overall productivity
growth.

A panel regression analysis applied to provincial level data on labor productivity shows investment in four
key areas, R&D and innovation, capital deepening, vocational training, and female labor force participation,
would raise labor productivity growth. In particular, a 1 percentage point increase in R&D could lead to a
0.05 percentage point increase in labor productivity growth after two years. With regard to capital
deepening, complementary investments in skillstraining are needed in order to make the best use of

the second year is suggestive of this effect.
The result on female labor force participation is
surprisingly strong, but should be interpreted with
caution since research in this area is still new and there
are few available country comparisons. Nevertheless,
the positive effect could reflect the higher share of
women graduating with tertiary education (60 percent)
in Canada, or changes in cultural norms such that firms
that have a higher propensity to hire women might also
be more dynamic in other aspects of production, or
better performing firms have a business culture that
attract more women. Recent IMF analysis shows
significant macroeconomic gains when women are able
to participate more fully in the labor market.2

AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS
37.
The authorities agree with staff’s assessment of the near-term growth outlook. In
their view, the Canadian economy is adjusting reasonably well to the sizable commodity price
shock, facilitated by accommodative macro policies and exchange rate depreciation. The
contraction of business investment in the commodity sector will continue to be a drag on
economic activity, but the effects of the negative factors weighing on the resource sector will
become less intense, and the drag on overall GDP growth is expected to wane over 2016.
Meanwhile, activity in the rest of the economy is expanding and is expected to be the main
source of growth over the next few years. In particular, they expect non-commodity exports to
trend upward, spurring investment and employment. The timing and magnitude of these
adjustments will determine potential output growth over the medium term.
38.
The authorities consider risks around the near-term outlook to remain on the
downside and largely external. They underscore that downside risks stem from uncertainty
surrounding the future path of oil prices and global growth. On the upside, a faster than
expected U.S. growth would increase demand for Canadian exports. The authorities also see
some upside for oil prices over the medium term. In particular, reduced access to financing for
highly indebted US shale oil producers and political instability in some oil exporters could result
in a faster-than-anticipated decline in supply. As non-OPEC supply declines and demand growth
remains steady, the current global supply overhang is expected to diminish.
39.
Financial stability risks are contained. While the authorities recognize that labor
market weakness in resource provinces will likely lead to an increase in loan delinquencies in the
coming months, they view the large banks to be well capitalized and able to absorb credit losses.
They note the strong growth in specific segments of some regional housing markets and the
degree of leverage in the system as a source of some concern. However, as long as interest rates
remain low and in the absence of a trigger, which would significantly increase unemployment
and reduce household income, the risk of a sharp, broad-based house price correction is viewed
as being remote. Furthermore, the authorities noted that the government guaranteed mortgage
insurance system would help to protect the financial system in a downturn, allow for mortgage
credit to continue to flow, and thus limit the impact from a potential tightening of mortgage
credit that could exacerbate a downturn in the housing market.
40.
The authorities agree that monetary policy should remain accommodative until the
economic recovery has firmed. If the economy were to weaken, a further cut in the policy rate
would be considered. The BOC does not see a need for unconventional monetary policies unless
the economy weakens substantially, and considers the risk of this occurring as very low.
41.
The BOC sees a role for monetary policy to take account of financial stability
considerations within its flexible inflation targeting framework. The BOC is prepared to
adjust the horizon for returning inflation to target depending on the nature and persistence of

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

31

CANADA

the shocks buffeting the economy. This allows the BOC to take financial stability considerations
into account within its current framework.
42.
The 2016 federal Budget is aimed at supporting the economy. The authorities believe
that in an environment of sustained economic weakness and historically low interest rates, fiscal
policy has an important role to play in delivering stronger growth today, and in expanding the
economy’s growth potential over the long term.
43.
The government views public infrastructure investment as critical to spearheading
long-term growth and is a strong advocate of this approach among the G20 community.
Low labor productivity growth has been a longstanding issue for Canada. Public infrastructure
investment that is well designed and executed could redress this problem, improve external
competitiveness and open up new export markets, and raise potential output. The authorities
view this strategy as particularly relevant in today’s “low growth, low inflation” world, where labor
input growth is expected to continue to decline in response to slower population growth and
aging. The government is seeking to engage private investors to create innovative funding
structures to increase the long-term affordability and sustainability of infrastructure in Canada.
44.
The federal government is committed to maintaining its low debt burden. In Budget
2016, the federal government announced that it is committed to undertaking investments in the
economy while maintaining Canada’s fiscal strength by reducing the federal debt-to-GDP ratio to
a lower level over a five-year period. A timeline for balancing the budget will be set when growth
is forecast to remain on a sustainably higher track.
45.
OSFI confirmed that it has not tightened regulations on CBRs, and any changes to
Canadian banks’ CBRs should have reflected their own business decisions. It is noted that
Canadian banks are making decisions about rationalizing correspondent banking relationships
from a risk adjusted profitability perspective. OSFI looks forward to participating in the FSB's
efforts on this subject.
46.
While improvements can be made, the authorities believe Canada’s macroprudential and supervisory frameworks are effective and appropriate in maintaining the
safety and soundness of the financial sector. The authorities consider the current approach for
macroprudential policy to have worked well, with members of the Senior Advisory Committee
(SAC) meeting regularly to share information and discuss systemic vulnerabilities and risks and
appropriate policy responses. They believe the SAC structure is flexible, facilitates coordination
and a discussion of policy trade-offs among the financial sector principals, and supports a nimble
response to emerging issues. OSFI is operationally independent and its administrative guidelines
are enforceable in practice because its numerous intervention powers and tools are legally
enforceable. OSFI’s use of guidelines provides it with the ability to act independently and quickly
in the face of emerging risks. OSFI’s risk-based approach to group-wide supervision of the
largest insurance companies also remains appropriate. It facilitates structured, effective and
comprehensive supervisory risk assessments.

STAFF APPRAISAL
47.
The oil shock is the first major test of Canada’s economic and financial resilience
since the 2008 global financial crisis. While there has been a sharp deceleration in growth as
oil companies slashed investment spending, the Canadian economy overall is coping well. An
accommodative monetary policy stance and exchange rate depreciation have helped cushion the
effects of the oil shock. Inflation remains well anchored. Unemployment has edged up, and the
negative output gap has widened to about 1 percent of GDP. The economy is projected to
recover gradually over the next two years and converge to potential growth of around 2 percent
over the medium term. Fiscal stimulus will facilitate a faster return of the economy to potential.
48.
The exchange rate is still moderately overvalued despite depreciating significantly
since 2014.
49.
The macro-financial effects of the oil shock have yet to fully play out, with
downside risks adding another layer of uncertainty. The economy is still adjusting to lower oil
prices, in part because the reallocation of capital and labor from the resource to the nonresource sectors is, expectedly, taking time. Reflecting the impact of the oil shock and a slowing
economy, financial vulnerabilities have become more apparent, as reflected in rising loan
delinquencies, albeit from low levels. While the banking system’s direct exposure to the energy
sector is limited, its indirect exposure to resource rich provinces is more substantial, and will
require higher provisions against deteriorating credit performance. More broadly, the weaker
economy has re-ignited concerns about the elevated level of household debt and vulnerabilities
related to the housing market. Another significant terms of trade shock or a global recession that
triggers a sharp increase in the unemployment rate could destabilize housing markets, setting
off adverse feedback loops in the economy and leading to greater financial stability risks.
50.
The near-term policy challenge is to pursue an appropriate policy mix that is
supportive of growth while containing vulnerabilities in the housing market. Monetary and
fiscal policy should work together to support the economy. With the policy rate near zero, and in
the absence of short-term supply constraints, fiscal policy becomes more potent in stimulating
demand as the multiplier effect under these circumstances is stronger. Pursuing greater balance
in the policy mix will also help reduce risk taking in a low interest rate environment and
discourage households from taking on more debt. Macroprudential policy can be further
tightened if imbalances in the housing market threaten to intensify. Enhancing financial sector
resilience is critical given considerable macro-financial linkages and housing market
vulnerabilities.
51.
The long-term policy challenge is to make the best use of the available fiscal space
to accelerate structural reform and diversify Canada’s future sources of growth. Political
resolve along with close collaboration between federal and provincial governments will be
necessary to push the agenda forward, ensure efficient implementation, and overcome
implementation challenges.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CANADA



Fiscal policy can play a catalytic role by increasing public infrastructure investment. If done
correctly, public infrastructure investment could pay for itself as debt-financed projects could
have large output effects without increasing the debt-to-GDP ratio. Setting up a nation-wide
infrastructure plan would help raise the quality of infrastructure investment through, among
others, better project appraisal, selection, financing, execution, and rigorous cost-benefit
analysis.



A multi-pronged approach is needed to improve productivity growth and external
competitiveness. Fiscal policy, through targeted R&D tax incentives to promote innovation
and competition, more generous childcare subsidies to encourage women to join the labor
market, and expanded publicly funded training programs to help workers retool their skills,
would place Canada in a better position to compete in existing and new export markets.

52.
To ensure fiscal credibility, the easing of the fiscal stance should be accompanied
by strengthening the medium term fiscal framework. The federal government’s commitment
to putting the debt to GDP ratio on a downward path is appropriate but a new fiscal rule is
needed to anchor fiscal sustainability and sustain market confidence. At the provincial level,
provinces with relatively high debt (Quebec) or a high deficit (Ontario) should continue to
consolidate their fiscal positions, but only gradually, so as not to offset the effect of the federal
government stimulus, whereas in Alberta, automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate fully
as there is no immediate fiscal sustainability concern.
53.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Annex I. Traction of Past Fund Advice
Consistent with Fund recommendations in the 2014 Article IV consultations, the Bank of Canada has
continued to maintain an accommodative monetary policy stance to support growth, while the
authorities have tightened macroprudential measures to contain risks in the housing sector. Fiscal
policy has become more supportive of growth. Significant progress has been made in implementing
the 2013 FSAP recommendations, but there has been less traction with regard to the
recommendation on the institutional framework for macroprudential oversight and regulatory
independence.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Canada
Foreign asset
and liability
position and
trajectory

Background. Canada posted a positive net international investment position (NIIP), which rose to C$471.9 billion by
end-2015, equivalent to 23.8 percent of GDP. This is in spite of the fact that the increase in foreign liabilities exceeded
the increase in foreign assets by C$55 billion. The gain in the NIIP thus resulted entirely from valuation effects of a
weaker Canadian dollar. Gross external debt rose by 18.9 percentage points to 108.9 percent of GDP between 2014 and
2015. Banks and other private sector hold 71 percent of the external debt, of which a half is short-term.
Assessment. The NIIP is sustainable with limited near term risk. External debt has risen sharply but remains modest
relative to other advanced economies. Canada’s foreign assets provide a hedge against currency depreciation.

Current
account

Background. Canada’s current account (CA) deteriorated from -2.3 percent of GDP in 2014 to -3.3 percent of GDP in
2015. Despite the sharp depreciation of the Canadian dollar (30 percent in the past two years) and a compression in
imports, a broad-based pickup in non-energy exports did not materialize to offset the decline in oil exports. This is
because manufacturing capacity was eroded during the oil boom years (2002-2012) when the real effective exchange
rate appreciated by 57 percent. It will take time to reallocate resources from the energy to the non-energy sector and
rebuild manufacturing capacity. In terms of the savings-investment balance (S-I), the deterioration in the CA was
consistent with a worsening of both the general government S-I balance (by 0.6 percentage points) and the private
sector’s S-I balance (0.5 percentage points).
Assessment. The EBA estimates a cyclically adjusted CA gap of -3.4 percent of GDP for 2015. This, however, likely
overstates the desirable external adjustment, because it overestimates the norm.1/ Staff assesses that the CA gap is
between -2 and -1 percent of GDP.

Real exchange
rate

Background. Canada’s exchange rate is highly correlated with oil prices. The real effective exchange rate has
depreciated by 8.4 percent on an annual average basis between 2014 and 2015. As of April 2016, the REER has
remained stable at it average 2015 level.
Assessment. Both the EBA REER index and level approaches estimate the currency to be undervalued, by 9.9-19.6
percent respectively in 2015. In staff’s assessment, however, the extent of undervaluation could be exaggerated for two
reasons. First, given Canada’s lost manufacturing capacity, further depreciation may be needed to restore
competitiveness. Second, Canada’s competitors in the US market have also seen their currencies depreciate by similar
magnitudes, thus limiting any net gain for Canada.2/ Given the CA gap, staff estimates that the real effective exchange
rate is, in fact, overvalued by 0 to 5 percent relative to medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings.

Capital and
financial
accounts:
flows and
policy
measures

Background. The CA deficit in 2015 has been financed primarily by net portfolio inflows. Foreign holdings of Canadian
stocks declined largely due to stock market capital losses, but this was offset by an increase in foreign holdings of
corporate bonds. Nearly three-quarters of corporate bonds held by non-residents are denominated in foreign
currencies compared with one-third of government bonds, and are therefore more sensitive to currency fluctuations.
Foreign direct investment recorded a net outflow in 2015.
Assessment. Canada has a fully open capital account. Vulnerabilities are limited by a credible commitment to a floating
exchange rate and a strong and credible fiscal position.

Overall Assessment
Overall Assessment:
The external position in 2015 was
moderately weaker than implied by
medium-term fundamentals and
desirable policy settings. The depreciation
of the currency has helped improve
Canada’s external competitiveness, but it
will take time for the economy to adjust
to the structural reallocation of resources
from the energy to the non-energy
sector. Recent developments do not
suggest a change in the assessment of
the external position in 2015.
In the medium term, the external position
is expected to strengthen as non-energy
exports gradually benefit from improved
price competitiveness and structural
improvements in manufacturing capacity.
Potential policy responses:
Significantly boosting Canada’s nonenergy exports would require addressing
a variety of structural issues in
manufacturing and promoting the
development of services exports.
Policies that could improve Canada’s
trade competitiveness include measures
geared at improving labor productivity;
investing in R&D and physical capital;
promoting FDI; and diversifying Canada’s
export markets. A credible medium-term
consolidation plan for fiscal policy will
also support the external rebalancing.

intervention
and reserves
level

Background. Canada has a free floating exchange rate regime, and it has not intervened in the foreign exchange
market since September 1998 (with the exception of participating in internationally concerted interventions for other
purposes). Canada has limited reserves but its central bank has standing swap arrangements with the U.S. Federal
Reserve and four other major central banks (it has not drawn on these swap lines in the past).
Assessment. Policies in this area are appropriate to the circumstances of Canada.

Technical
Background
Notes

1/. There are three reasons why the Canada’s CA norm may be below EBA’s estimated CA norm. First, the model adjusts for the business cycle using Canada’s
output gap relative to the world (GDP-weighted average) output gap, while a more relevant measure for Canada is the output gap relative to the United States.
Using the US as the benchmark would reduce the CA norm for Canada because the output gap for the United States is slightly larger (more negative) than the world
output gap. Second, the EBA overestimates Canada’s trade balance by using the WEO global oil prices rather than the lower market price for Canadian oil,
particularly, heavy crude oil from western Canada’s oil sands (the lower price reflects lower quality). Third, the EBA does not take into account the structural loss in
trade competitiveness.
2/. The EBA REER approach does not fully capture the loss in Canada’s structural competitiveness for a number of reasons: First, the approach includes commodity
terms of trade rather than oil prices as an explanatory variable. However, Canada’s REER has mirrored movements in oil prices much more closely than its
commodity terms of trade. Second, protracted structural rebalancing in the non-energy sector, in conjunction with a long-term erosion of market share among US
imports imply a less competitive economy than the EBA fit could account for. While Canada’s currency has depreciated versus the US dollar, so have the currencies
of some its key competitors on the US market, like Mexico. Estimates of an adjusted REER that takes account of Canada’s relative competitiveness in third markets
suggest that Canada’s REER has depreciated considerably less than the unadjusted REER. The EBA’s estimated REER gap would thus be smaller (less negative). More
than half the gain in price competitiveness is undone when competitors are taken into account. See Barnett, Charbonneau and Poulin-Bellisle, “A New Measure of
the Canadian Effective Exchange Rate”, Bank of Canada Staff Discussion Paper 2016-1.

Annex III. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
Canada’s public debt remains on a sustainable trajectory over the medium term. Under the baseline,
the ratio of gross debt to GDP will peak at about 93 percent in 2016 and gradually decline to
83 percent by 2021. The debt ratio does not rise above 100 percent under most stress scenarios. Sizable
financial assets (about 65 percent of GDP) provide an additional cushion. The net debt-to-GDP ratio
stood at 27 percent in 2015 and is expected to fall below 20 percent by 2021. Canada’s debt dynamics
are sensitive to adverse growth shocks.

Baseline scenario
Under the staff’s baseline macroeconomic scenario, the general government primary deficit is
projected to increase to 2 percent of GDP in 2016 and, with fiscal consolidation, decline to 1 percent
by 2021. The increase in the primary deficit along with the decline in nominal GDP growth will raise
the general government gross debt-to-GDP ratio to about 93 percent in 2016, declining thereafter
to 83 percent by 2021. By the authorities’ definition which includes a wider coverage of assets net
debt stood at 27 percent of GDP in 2015. If only highly-liquid assets (currency, deposits, and bonds)
are included, the net debt-to-GDP ratio was higher at around 62 percent. The net debt ratio is
expected to decline from 27 percent to below 20 percent by 2021. Gross financing needs at around
20 percent is high but manageable and will decline to below 18 percent by the end of the projection
period. Effective interest rates will stay at historic lows.

Stress tests


Primary balance shock. A deterioration of the primary balance of about one percent of GDP
would raise the gross debt-to-GDP ratio by about 2–3 percentage points over the projection
period. The sovereign risk premium is assumed to increase by 25 basis points for each one
percent of GDP deterioration in the primary balance, resulting in higher gross financing needs of
2–3 percentage points of GDP compared to the baseline.



Growth shock. A lower real GDP growth by one standard deviation for two years starting in 2017
and 2018 will lead to a sharp deterioration in the primary balance, reaching a 4 percent deficit at
its peak in 2018. The gross debt-to-GDP ratio will reach 95 percent of GDP in 2018, but would
revert to a downward path over the projection period. Gross financing needs will also be larger.



Interest rate shock. An increase in the sovereign risk premium by 200 basis points for two years
would raise the effective interest rate ½–¾ percentage points higher than the baseline. The
impact on debt and gross financing needs are mild.



Exchange rate shock. Given that almost 90 percent of Canada’s outstanding marketable debt
instruments are in Canadian dollars the fiscal impact of an exchange rate shock is minimal, even
with the substantial exchange rate depreciation of about 33 percent since 2014.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND



Stagnant growth scenario. In the event of a confluence of downside risks leading to a structural
slowdown in advanced and emerging economies, oil prices fall or stay low for a prolonged
period, and the structural adjustment from the resource sector to the non-resource sector takes
longer than anticipated, GDP growth could fall below the baseline scenario by ½–1 percentage
points for the projection horizon. In this scenario, the gross debt-to-GDP ratio will stay flat at the
current level and will not decline.



Housing market and contingent fiscal shock: Under this scenario, a severe recession reduces real
GDP by two standard deviations for three years (to -1½ percent), precipitating a housing market
crash. Assuming 5 percent of the outstanding amount of government-backed insurance is called
the government’s non-interest expense would increase by the equivalent to 1¾ percent of GDP.
The debt-to GDP ratio would rise above 100 percent of GDP while gross financing needs would
reach 25 percent of GDP at its peak. The debt ratio would decline only in 2020.

The sizable general government financial
assets provide a layer of cushion against
shocks. The general government’s financial
assets stood at about 65 percent of GDP in
2015, of which about 45 percent (30 percent of
GDP) were highly-liquid assets (deposits, shortterm papers, and bonds) (Chart).

on mortgage insurance. Mortgage insurers are
well capitalized. Under the Minimum Capital Test (MCT), CMHC holds 365 percent of capital
available over the minimum capital required, while Genworth holds 234 percent. CMHC’s stress test
results show that under severe global deflation stress scenarios (where the unemployment rises to
nearly 16 percent and house prices fall by 44 percent), its capital would be significantly depleted to
147 percent of MCT, but still above the regulatory requirement of 100 percent. CMHC conducts
annual stress test to set capital levels for the risk it holds.
Highly liquid

Public debt has increased in recent years, reflecting the government’s policy to fund public
sector employee pension plans by issuing new debt. General government debt as reported here
does not include unfunded pension liabilities. The vast majority of advanced economies do not
report unfunded pension liabilities and as such they are excluded from measures of public sector
debt to allow for consistent international comparison. General government debt, including
unfunded pension liabilities, would be 109 percent of GDP on a gross basis, and 44 percent of GDP
on a net basis in 2015.

Annex IV. Unconventional Monetary Policy—Preliminary
Considerations
Measure
Forward guidance: conditional
statements about the path of
policy interest rates tied to the
inflation outlook or other
economic variables

Objectives/International Experience

Aspects of Implementation

Influence the term structure of interest rates in the
absence of the actual rate cuts and reduce interest rate
volatility due to higher predictability of monetary policy.

Forward guidance puts a premium on
communication and credibility. Bank of
Canada (BOC) has strong credibility.

International experience: Effective in lowering
expectations of the future path of policy rates; improving
predictability of short-term yields for short horizons;
lowering sensitivity of financial variables to economic
news (suggesting that markets perceive the guidance as
binding).

The Governor of the BOC solely makes
the call on monetary policy which
facilitates the implementation of
forward guidance, although the
Governing Council has influence too..

However, qualitative forward guidance could be too
vague; time-contingent forward guidance could be timeinconsistent; explicit conditionality in time-contingent
forward guidance may dilute the initial commitment;
while choosing appropriate thresholds in statecontingent forward guidance could be challenging.
Negative policy rates

Boost aggregate demand by engineering negative shortterm market rates, with transmission to long-term rates.
International experience with negative policy rates is
limited. Most countries that have used negative interest
rates have implemented them in the form of negative
deposit rates applying to excess reserves in the context
of QE. These policies have been partially effective in
some countries. Negative deposit rates have typically not
been passed on to retail customers.

Large-scale asset purchases:
outright purchases of financial
assets, including longer-term
government bonds and private
assets (e.g. mortgage backed
securities and corporate
bonds).

Reduce yields for broader segments of financial assets
and ease overall financial conditions through portfolio
rebalancing.

Funding for credit (FFC):
collateralized term lending to
banks at a subsidized rate, with
banks subjected to certain
lending objectives.

Ensure credit flow to the specific sectors of the economy
where credit supply is judged to be impaired.

International experience. Reduced U.S. 10-year Treasury
yields by 65 to 120 basis points, with a positive impact on
real GDP of 2–3 percent by 2012; reduced the U.K. gilt
yields by 45 to 150 bps, and increased the level of U.K.
GDP by 0.65–1.75 percent. Calibrating the size of QE
could be challenging. There are communication
challenges around exit (taper tantrum). Central bank
balance sheets significantly expanded.

International experience: Successful in increasing
mortgage lending growth to households but less
successful in channeling credit to SMEs and private
businesses in the UK.

Successful experience: BOC pioneered
time-contingent forward guidance in
2009, indicating that the policy rate
target rate would remain unchanged
for one year, conditional on the
outlook for inflation. This forward
guidance expired in April 2010.
The effective lower bound is estimated
to be around -0.5 percent in Canada. A
negative interest rate could be
introduced through BOC’s interest rate
corridor system.
Canadian banks are unlikely to pass
negative interest rates to retail
depositors (Retail deposits make up 53
percent of total nonfinancial private
sector deposits of charted banks).
Currently the yield curve is relatively
flat.
LSAPs “…could include longer-term
government securities or private assets
such as mortgage-backed and
corporate securities.”

Canadian banks have strong balance
sheets. FFC could be implemented as
subsidized collateralized term funding
to banks. However, demand rather
than supply factors may be at play. If
balance sheets are impaired,
households and small businesses may
save and not borrow.

- enhances disclosure requirements, which will support greater transparency, clarity and public
confidence in mortgage insurers’ residential mortgage insurance underwriting practices
Mortgage insurance premiums were raised
The minimum down payment for new insured mortgages increased from 5 to 10 percent for the
portion of the house price above $500,000. The 5 percent minimum down payment for properties
up to $500,000 remained unchanged
Issuance limits for NHA MBS in 2016 will be kept effectively unchanged as part of the ongoing
effort to limit government involvement in the mortgage market
Guarantee fee for NHA MBS and the CMB program will be increased to encourage the
development of private market funding alternatives by narrowing the funding cost difference
between government sponsored and private market funding sources

Annex VI. 2014 FSAP Key Recommendations and Implementation
Recommendation

Time
Frame

Update since 2014 Article IV

Reduce government exposure to
mortgage insurance gradually.

Long term

The authorities introduced a range of measures over the past several years, including
more recently in December 2015 (see Section D in the main text).

Include major regulated entities at
federal and provincial level in a
regular, common stress testing
exercise with collaboration between
relevant federal and provincial
authorities.

Short term

The Bank of Canada has provided quantitative scenarios, detailed macro stress testing
instructions, advice and technical assistance to the Autorité des Marchés financiers (AMF)
(Quebec) to support their stress testing build out.

Equip OSFI with powers to make its
own enforceable rules by
administrative means, supplementing
the use of guidelines and government
regulations; amend legislation on
statutory decisions to give OSFI sole
decision- making authority on
prudential criteria.

Medium
term

Replace certain informal and ad hoc
reporting requirements by FRFIs with
more formal requirements (in keeping
with BCP 1,2 and ICP 1,2)

Medium
term

The Bank also had detailed technical discussions related to macro stress testing capacity
building (e.g., probability of default modeling) with the British Columbia Financial
Institutions Commission.
The authorities do not intend to pursue this recommendation.
Authorities’ response “OSFI’s administrative guidelines are enforceable in practice because
its numerous intervention powers and tools are legally enforceable. OSFI’s use of
guidelines provides OSFI with the ability to act independently and quickly in the face of
emerging risks.”

Use of the Regulatory Data Governance Framework to provide a transparent process for
prioritizing regulatory data requirements and regulatory data lifecycle management,
thereby ensuring that regulatory data is managed as an OSFI-wide strategic enterprise
asset.
In 2016, the existing ad hoc collection of Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) Key
Metrics will be replaced with a formal regulatory return.

Adopt a transparent and consistent
regulatory regime for group-wide
insurance supervision; give OSFI the
authority to take supervisory measures
at the level of the holding company.

Medium
term

Augment OSFI’s top-down stress
testing framework for banks with risksensitive concepts of credit risk input
parameters and econometric, modelbased efforts using longer time series.

Short term

Expand financial sector data collection
and dissemination with a view to
enhancing coverage, regularity, and
availability of time-series to facilitate
analysis (in keeping with BCP 28, ICP
20, IOSCO 6,7)

Short term

64

The authorities do not intend to pursue this recommendation.
Authorities’ response, “Canada is satisfied with OSFI’s current approach to group-wide
supervision of the largest insurance companies and will not be seeking legislative
amendments.”

The authorities will consider this in the future, as the stress testing framework evolves.

Housing Finance
 In 2015, the Department of Finance (DOF) started to regularly collect loan-level data
from Canada’s three mortgage insurers on quarterly loan originations covering
borrower attributes, dwelling characteristics, and mortgage-loan terms. It is shared with
the Bank and OSFI to help agencies conduct policy analysis. DOF is reaching out to
industry to obtain loan-level origination data from federally unregulated mono-line
mortgage lenders and exploring means to better quantify and understand foreign
investment in residential real estate.
 Statistics Canada will conduct a triennial Survey of Financial Security and annual
estimates of household asset and debt distributions with an enhanced focus on
mortgage debt. Previously this survey was only conducted on an intermittent basis.
 Discussions on data availability and gaps are ongoing amongst Senior Advisory
Committee agencies and CMHC. In 2015, CMHC held a series of round tables to obtain
industry views on data gaps and solutions.
 CMHC has also expanded the information publically available via its Quarterly Financial
Reports and expanded coverage of its surveys. In 2015, CMHC published findings from
the survey of foreign ownership of condos in 16 Census Metropolitan Areas and in
2016, CMHC will begin collecting data on sales to foreign buyers in Toronto, Montreal
and Vancouver through its starts and completions surveys.

CANADA

Recommendation

Time
Frame

Update since 2014 Article IV
Fixed-Income Markets
The Bank and the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) have
implemented a new version of the Market Trade Reporting System (MTRS), which will
collect a wealth of transaction-level data from all IIROC-registered broker-dealers,
including prices, quantities and counterparties of all bond, bill and repo trades to which an
IIROC-registered broker-dealer is a counterparty. IIROC collects the data and will pass a
subset of the information to the Bank. MTRS is the successor to the Bank’s former
aggregate-level trade reporting system, to be decommissioned in 2016.
Canadian Securities Administrators Data
In September 2015, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) proposed that trade
information for all corporate debt securities executed by dealers be made publicly
available, subject to delayed dissemination and volume caps, by the end of 2017. The CSA
intends to use the information reported to MTRS (described above) relating to corporate
debt securities to implement its transparency proposal. Specifically, IIROC will act as an
information processor for corporate debt securities and will publicly disseminate trade
information relating to those securities, subject to dissemination delay and volume caps.
The public consultation period for the CSA notice ended in November.
OTC Derivatives Trade Reporting
Provincial rules on trade reporting have been in effect in Manitoba, Ontario and Québec
since October 1, 2014. The rules require most OTC derivatives transactions involving a
“local counterparty” in the three provinces to be reported to a designated trade repository
(TR). Currently there are three designated TRs (DTTC; CME; and ICE TV). The trade
reporting rule sets out market participants’ trade reporting and record retention
obligations, the rules for public dissemination of trade data and a trade repository
recognition and compliance regime. Public dissemination of market data is set to begin
on January 16, 2017, subject to ministerial approval. Other provinces recently published a
similar trade reporting rule for OTC derivatives transactions expected to come into force
on May 1, 2016, but still subject to ministerial approval. Counterparties to the trade are
expected to start reporting before July 29, 2016.

Address shortcomings in risk
identification and enforcement in
securities regulation.

Short term

In July 2015, the Council of Ministers, comprised of the provincial and territorial Ministers
responsible for securities regulation in British Columbia, Ontario, Saskatchewan, New
Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Yukon, and the Minister of Finance Canada,
announced that Mr. William A. Black would be the chair of the Capital Markets Regulatory
Authority’s initial board of directors.
In August 2015, participating jurisdictions released an updated consultation draft
provincial and territorial capital markets legislation, along with draft initial regulations, for
public comment. Participating jurisdictions are assessing the comments received.

Enhance supervisory cooperation
among federal and provincial
supervisors and subject all systemically
significant financial institutions to
intensive supervision (BCP 3, ICP3)

Short term

Provide a clear mandate to an entity (i)
to monitor systemic risk to facilitate
macro-prudential oversight, and (ii) to
carry out system-wide crisis
preparedness.

Short term

Increase the ex-ante funding of CDIC
and enhance its data collection and
analysis of depositor profiles.

Medium
term

OSFI and the AMF have instituted a new cooperation framework whereby meetings are
scheduled on a regular basis to discuss issues of mutual interest, in addition to existing
consultation procedures.

The authorities do not intend to pursue this recommendation.
Authorities’ response, “as noted in the previous FSAP, the regulatory and supervisory
framework demonstrates strong compliance with international standards and is well
coordinated across the federal oversight bodies. Responsibility for addressing systemic
risk remains with the Senior Advisory Committee, a non-statutory body chaired by the
Deputy Minister of Finance.”
The minimum target level of CDIC’s ex ante funding is 100 basis points of insured
deposits. CDIC continues to progressively increase its ex ante fund to reach this target.

Appendix I. Trade Competitiveness in Canada
1.
Motivation. The conventional wisdom is that Canada’s non-energy exports have been held
back primarily because the commodity boom led to a
real appreciation of the Canadian dollar. This so-called
‘Dutch disease’ did indeed render some
manufacturing industries uncompetitive, in particular
forestry products and motor vehicles and parts which
together account for almost three quarters of
Canada’s lost share on the U.S. non-energy imports
market during 2002–2014. But while exchange rate
movements undoubtedly played a role, our study
(Agur, 2016) asks whether this is the entire story. From
a policy perspective, the right diagnosis matters
greatly: is the recent depreciation by itself enough to
regain competitiveness in manufacturing exports?
2.
Approach. Our study therefore considers whether structural factors are also responsible for
the relatively weak performance of Canadian manufacturing exports since 1997. It estimates an
export supply regression that spans 8 product categories and 10 provinces over a 17 year sample
period (from 1997 to 2014). In this export supply regression, product prices are given because
Canada is a small open economy. Foreign demand effects are therefore implicitly captured in the
export price deflators. Our study is the first to estimate export supply using granular panel data
along both the product and province dimension.1 The advantages are twofold: (i) the disaggregated
data is able to capture divergent trends among provinces, even within the same industry. For
instance, real exports of industrial machinery have doubled in Quebec since 2003, while they have
remained unchanged in Ontario over the same period; (ii) since all provinces trade abroad at the
same exchange rate, the disaggregated data is able to identify differences in structural factors in
determining export competitiveness.
3.
Methodology. The dependent variable is real export growth. The independent variables are
factors of production that define the cost efficiency, availability and quality of inputs into the
production process, and should thus determine the relative trade performance of a country to its
peers. In our regression, wages and export prices capture the relative cost of producing a unit of
export good, and labor productivity represents the production efficiency frontier. Variables relating
to physical and human capital formation represent the availability and quality of factors of
production. This latter group of variables, however, exhibits a high degree of multicollinearity. To
mitigate this problem, the study applies factor analysis to extract a common factor from these

1

While not used in export supply regressions before, the province dimension of Canadian trade data has been
extensively applied as part of the literature on “border effects” (provincial borders versus the U.S. border). See
Suvankulov (BOC WP 2015-28) for a review of this literature.

variables, henceforth the “capital investment”, to collectively represent physical and human capital
accumulation. The elasticity estimate for capital investment as well the separate estimates of the
variables representing this joint factor is reported in the results. Estimation results of the panel
regressions are shown in the table below.
4.
Panel regression results. Our results show that cost and efficiency, namely relative prices,
real wages and labor productivity, have a strong impact on Canada’s trade competitiveness
(Table 1). These factors essentially capture three different aspects of price competitiveness. The
relative price of exports is the variable with the largest impact. While exchange rate movements take
time to pass on to prices, these results indicate that Canada’s non-energy export performance is
quite sensitive to the value of the Canadian dollar. Reduced input costs (lower wages) and increased
output efficiency (labor productivity) also significantly affect export performance. But wages and
labor productivity are slower moving variables and their impact on export growth is quantitatively
smaller than for exchange rates. Importantly however, our study finds that there is more to
improving manufacturing export growth than improving price competitiveness alone.
5.
The most important implication of this study is that structural variables matter for
Canadian manufacturing exports. We see this from

manufacturing exports among the capital factors
of production, with a 1 to 1 increase on real export growth. Well-targeted projects, especially in
infrastructure development, could stimulate (“crowd in”) business investment, and thereby
improve competitiveness. In the long run capital accumulation is also a key determinant of labor
productivity. Physical capital can thus also indirectly raise export growth, because it lifts labor
productivity.



Policies to promote R&D spending by businesses would also have a big pay off as a
1 percentage point rise in R&D brings about 0.5 percentage point faster export growth. But
company spending on innovation and capacity to innovate continue to score well below levels in
the U.S. In fact, “insufficient capacity to innovate” is ranked as Canada’s most problematic factor
for doing business.2

Government investment



Inward FDI into the Canadian manufacturing sector plays a role in raising export performance
too, with 0.25 percentage point faster export growth for a 1 percentage point increase in inward
FDI.



Given the already high level of education in Canada, the positive coefficient suggests that more
specialized or job-specific, vocational training could be a particularly effective way to improve
job skills and job matching in the manufacturing sector.



Government investment has the lowest impact but it is not significant. It is likely that this
variable captures the residual impact of government investment above and beyond what can
explained by infrastructure investment.

In sum, while exchange rate depreciation will support the rebalancing toward non-energy exports,
external competitiveness does not depend on prices alone. Quality matters too, and this is where
greater investment in the capital stock, training, and innovation at the firm level may reap double
dividends, raising both the capacity and the quality of production and exports.
6.
Implications for exporting industries. Looking across Canadian manufacturing industries,
which are the most likely to benefit from structural measures? And which structural measures would
be more relevant? We draw on a study by the Conference Board of Canada ranks export industries
by supply-side and demand-side constraints, as summarized in the figure below.

near 100 percent capacity. The erosion in
manufacturing capacity during the early 2000s would need to be restored to take full advantage of
the increase in demand for these products. Structural reform to expand capacity, including
investment in human and physical capital and putting in place the right conditions to attract FDI
would help boost exports.

8.
Demand constrained. Industries such as the manufacturing of metal products, industrial
machinery, plastic and rubber products, and aircraft and parts, and computer and electronic
products have plenty of capacity but global demand for these products has declined.
a. Metal products are highly dependent on global construction demand. Exports of metal
products grew rapidly when construction activity was booming in China; in particular,
between 2002 and 2012 Canadian metal products exports to China increased eightfold.
Since the slowdown in the Chinese economy, exports have declined, leaving the industry
with low capacity utilization.
b. Industrial machinery, plastic and rubber products and aircraft and parts are dependent
on US business investment, which has seen sluggish growth in recent years.4
c.

Computer and electronic exports has suffered a setback mainly because Blackberry,
which has been Canada’s prime exporter, has seen a deep fall in its share of the global
Smartphone market (table).

In these industries where demand is constrained, exchange rate deprecation would help tilt price
competitiveness in favor of Canadian exports. However, the Canadian dollar is a commodity
currency that fluctuates with the oil price. An increase in the oil price would appreciate the currency
and wipe out any gain in competitiveness. Structural measures that improve labor productivity and
innovation are essential to enable these industries to compete in existing and new export markets,
and claw back market share. For firms in industries at the technological frontier, innovative success is
a prerequisite for sustained growth.

the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. Canada maintains
exchange restrictions for security reasons, based on UN Security Council Resolutions, that have been
notified to the Fund for approval (most recently in June 10, 2014) under the procedures set forth in
Executive Board Decision No. 144–(52/51).
Last Article IV Consultation: The Staff Report for the 2014 consultation with Canada was

academic, business sector representatives, and think tanks.

FSSA Participation and ROSC Assessments
Canada–Financial System Stability Assessment–
Volume II: Report on Observance of Standards in
the Financial System

www.imf.org
June 30, 2000

Summary: The FSSA report concluded that Canada has a stable and highly advanced financial
system, which is among the soundest in the world. It is supported by a well-developed regulatory
system that shows a high degree of compliance with major international standards. The FSSA
report made a few recommendations to further strengthen the regulatory framework and
financial system’s resilience, most of which have already been addressed, including:


Introducing capital requirements for the guarantees in life insurance segregated fund
(completed by end-2001);



Tabling legislation granting the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions
(OSFI) powers to remove a financial institution’s director or senior officer if the person is
deemed not suitable to hold that office based on a number of criteria. The latter
legislation brought Canada into broad compliance with the Basel Core Principles;



Making significant progress in harmonizing securities regulation and improving
coordination among provincial securities regulators, including through a newly created
association of securities regulators, the Canadian Securities Administrators. Although
there remain multiple regulators at the provincial level, a Senate commission was created

to develop specific recommendations on further harmonization and streamlining of
securities regulation.
Canada: Report on the Observance of Standards
and Codes—Fiscal Transparency Module

IMF Country Report
No. 02/51, 03/12/02

Summary: The report found that fiscal management in Canada meets the requirements of the
fiscal transparency code, and in a number of instances represents best practice. In particular, it
highlighted the use of private sector economic forecasts. Fiscal management was also
commended for its statistical integrity, impartial tax administration, open procurement, and a
transparent regulatory process.
The report found several areas where further improvements would be desirable, including: (i) the
preparation of timely, current year estimates of federal and provincial budgets on a comparable
basis, (ii) a comprehensive account of the procedures for the budget cycle and expenditure
management system, (iii) systematic reporting of the use of reserves for non-economic
contingencies, (iv) resumption of publication of reconciled national and public accounts forecasts
of major aggregates over the forecast horizon, and (v) publication by all governments of quasifiscal activities.
Many of these issues have been addressed, including: (i) the release by Statistics Canada of
consolidated data for federal and provincial budgets for 2001–02 (on a Financial Management
System basis); (ii) the publication of comprehensive descriptions of budget and expenditure
management procedures, including a joint document entitled “Budgeting in Canada” by the
Government and the OECD, detailed accounts of policies and procedures on expenditure
management at the website of the Treasury Board Secretariat, and the explanation of the budget
cycle and process in Budget and Update documents; and (iii) publication of reconciled national
and public accounts forecasting.
Canada: Report on the Observance of Standards
and Codes—Data Module

IMF Country Report No. 03/328,
10/23/03

Summary: Canada’s macroeconomic statistics are comprehensive, timely, and accurate and thus
adequate to conduct effective surveillance of economic and financial policies. Official institutions
responsible for the compilation and dissemination of the macroeconomic datasets are supported
by adequate legal and institutional frameworks. These frameworks protect confidentiality and
ensure that statistical work is conducted within a quality assurance program and with sufficient
resources. Integrity is ensured by the professionalism of the staff, transparency in statistical
policies and practices, and the provision of ethical guidelines for staff. Compilers generally follow
internationally accepted guidelines in the production of the macroeconomic statistics, which is
well-supported by excellent efforts to develop source data that facilitate a high degree of
accuracy and reliability. Statistics are generally relevant, well documented, available with good
frequency on a timely basis, and readily accessible to users, who trust them as objective.
While recognizing the high quality of the macroeconomic data, the report makes

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CANADA

recommendations to further strengthen the statistical system, most of which are already being
addressed, including these priorities:


Articulate the roles of Statistics Canada and the Bank of Canada in producing financial sector
statistics and explore possibilities for more data sharing of monetary and financial statistics;



Estimate consumption of fixed capital at replacement cost rather than historic costs now used
for the corporate sector in the Canadian System of National Accounts (CSNA);



Disseminate information on the sources and methods used in compiling quarterly public
sector statistics for the quarterly CSNA; and



Reclassify certain transactions that are not recorded in line with the 5th edition of the Balance
of Payments Manual (BPM5).

Canada: Report on the Observance of Standards
and Codes––FATF Recommendations for AntiMoney Laundering and Combating the Financing
of Terrorism

IMF Country Report No. 08/372,
12/11/08

Summary: Canada’s anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT)
framework was last assessed by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the Asia Pacific Group
on Money Laundering (APG) in March 2007. Shortcomings were identified in particular with
respect to the scope of customer due diligence, the implementation of AML/CFT supervision, and
the effectiveness of the financial intelligence unit (FINTRAC). Since 2007, Canada submitted six
follow-up reports to the FATF, the last one in February 2014, and took a number of steps to
strengthen the framework in these areas. The next mutual evaluation of Canada will be conducted
by the Fund and is scheduled in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Canada: Financial System Stability AssessmentUpdate

IMF Country Report No. 08/59,
02/13/08

Summary: The FSSA update concluded that Canada’s financial system is mature, sophisticated,
and well-managed. Financial stability was underpinned by sound macroeconomic policies and
strong prudential regulation and supervision, and well-designed deposit insurance and
arrangements for crisis management and failure resolution. The banking system appeared sound,
with stress tests showing that the major banks could withstand sizeable shocks, although they did
faces some challenges related to the global financial turmoil that started in mid-2007. Also, there
were some concerns about bank attempts to build on their secure domestic position, to enter
highly competitive foreign markets or complex activities. The update reiterated the advantages of
moving towards a single securities regulator, including the streamlining of policy development,
reductions in compliance costs, and improved enforcement. However, it also recognized the
significant improvements to the regulatory system from the creation of the Canadian Securities
Administrators (CSA), and the implementation of the passport system.

Canada: Financial System Stability AssessmentUpdate

IMF Country Report No. 14/29,
02/03/14

Summary: The FSSA Update found that Canada’s financial system successfully navigated the
global financial crisis, and stress tests suggest that major Canadian financial institutions are
resilient to credit, liquidity, and contagion risks arising from a severe stress scenario. Elevated
house prices and high household debt remain an area of concern (despite the substantial level of
government-guaranteed mortgage insurance), though targeted prudential and macro-prudential
measures are proving to be effective. The regulatory and supervisory framework demonstrates
strong compliance with international standards. Nevertheless, the Update called for more clarity
around the legal independence of OSFI and for assigning stronger prudential responsibilities to
this regulator. In the securities markets, provincial regulators and the federal government have
made significant progress in implementing a robust and harmonized framework, but challenges
remain in enforcement, risk identification, and timely policy making. The FSSA Update argued that
the federal system of safety nets is credible, although there is no single body with an explicit
mandate to take a comprehensive view of systemic risks or to undertake crisis preparedness.
Improving cooperation between federal and provincial authorities would further reinforce systemwide oversight arrangements.
Technical Assistance: Not Applicable.
Resident Representative: Not Applicable.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
The quality, coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of Canada’s economic data are considered to be
adequate both in the context of the Article IV consultation and for purposes of ongoing surveillance.
Canada has subscribed to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), and its metadata
are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB). The data ROSC was
published on October 23, 2003.
Real Sector. Statistics Canada provides timely and adequate data in monthly, quarterly, and annual
frequency thereby facilitating the analyses of economic developments and policy assessments within
a quantitative macroeconomic framework. In May 2001, Statistics Canada effected a smooth
transition from Laspeyres methodology for estimating real expenditure-based GDP to Fisher index
formulae, which enabled more accurate comparison between Canada and other G-7 countries. In
October 2012, Statistics Canada started aligning the Canadian System of National Accounts (CSNA)
with the SNA2008 international standard. The changes introduced in the CSNA2012 included,
among others, capitalization of research and development, move to replacement cost-based
valuation of consumption of fixed capital, and valuing equity more consistently at market price.
Additional changes were introduced with the 2014 release of the CSNA, which for the most part did
not have a significant impact on GDP and represented the development of new accounts, improved
integration between the CSNA and Government Finance Statistics, additional detail, and
presentational changes that better align with international standards (see, Statistics Canada). In 2015
6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CANADA

Statistics Canada carried out comprehensive revision to the Canadian System of Macroeconomic
Accounts (CSMA). The four main sources of revision with that release of the CSMA were: the
integration of Government Finance Statistics, the improved treatment of defined benefit pension
plans, the measurement of financial services purchased by households’, and updated measures of
national wealth.
Fiscal Sector. Statistics Canada provides quarterly data (a Statement of Government Operations
along with a Balance Sheet) on the general government and its subsectors following the
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) recommendations. In November 2014,
Statistics Canada published the provisional (unconsolidated) data on Canadian Government Finance
Statistics (CGFS) for 2008–2012 (see, Statistics Canada). This covers the statement of operations for
all components of general government, as well as federal and provincial and territorial government
business enterprises. Data on the functional expenses were also released. Subsequently, in February
2015, estimates for financial flows and the balance sheet of the general government and
government business enterprises for 2007–2012 were published (see Statistics Canada). In March
2016, Statistics Canada published Consolidated Government Finance Statistics data for 2008-2014
for the first time (see Statistics Canada). In addition, the Department of Finance Canada provides
monthly and annual data on the federal government’s budget (according to the national
presentation) and tax policies. The provided data enable adequate assessment of the impact of fiscal
policy measures on Canada’s economic performance.
Financial Sector. The Bank of Canada and OSFI provide monthly and quarterly data on the broad
range of financial variables. However, the 2013 FSSA Update recommended that financial sector
data collection and dissemination should be expanded with a view to enhancing coverage,
regularity, and availability of time-series to facilitate analysis.
Monetary Sector. The Bank of Canada provides timely and adequate coverage of daily, weekly,
monthly, and quarterly data related to the monetary sector.
External Sector. Statistics Canada provides timely information on a quarterly frequency on the
balance of payments, external debt, and the international investment position. Department of
Finance Canada provides monthly data on Official International Reserves in a format comparable to
the IMF’s reserve data template, thus enabling adequate surveillance. Data are published at
http://www.fin.gc.ca/pub/oir-ro-eng.asp.
