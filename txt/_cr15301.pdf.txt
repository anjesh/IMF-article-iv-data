IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Angola
On October 28, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
2015 Article IV consultation1 with Angola.
The oil price shock is adversely impacting the economy. Angola’s oil basket is projected to
average US$53 per bbl in 2015, from slightly over US$100 per bbl in 2014, leading to large
declines in fiscal revenue and exports. While oil production has recovered following the
completion of maintenance work, non-oil GDP growth is expected to decelerate to 2.1 percent in
2015. The industrial, construction and services sectors are adjusting to the decline in private
consumption and public investment and lingering difficulties to obtain foreign currency. Inflation
is projected to reach close to 14 percent by end-2015, exceeding the National Bank of Angola
(BNA)’s 7-9 percent objective. The 2015 budget will allow the central government deficit to fall
to 3.5 percent of GDP, compared to 6.4 percent last year. Public debt, however, is projected to
increase significantly to 57.4 percent of GDP, of which 14.7 percent of GDP corresponds to the
state-owned oil company Sonangol, by end-2015. The external current account deficit is
expected to reach 7.6 percent of GDP in 2015; and international reserves to drop to
US$22.3 billion (about 7 months of 2016 imports) by end-2015. Meanwhile, a wide spread
emerged between the parallel and primary market exchange rates, pointing to an imbalance in the
foreign exchange market.
The economic situation in 2016 is likely to remain challenging as international oil prices are not
expected to recover and risks are on the downside. Growth is projected to remain stable at
3.5 percent in 2016, with the oil sector growing by about 4 percent. The non-oil sector is
expected to show a small improvement, growing by 3.4 percent year-on-year, driven mainly by a
stronger recovery in agriculture. Inflation is projected to slow to 13 percent at end-2016, as the
effect of the recent monetary tightening is expected to be felt more clearly in the second half of
2016.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the timely policy actions in response to the
decline in oil prices. Although the outlook for growth is stable, persistent low international oil
prices and the uncertain global environment pose considerable risks. Directors stressed that
continued commitment to sound policies and undertaking ambitious structural reforms is critical
to safeguard macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability, address protracted imbalances in
the foreign exchange market, and promote strong and inclusive growth.
Directors welcomed the tightened fiscal stance to shield the economy against the vulnerabilities
arising from the oil price shock and agreed that continued adjustment will be needed going
forward. They encouraged the authorities to gradually restore fiscal buffers and ensure that part
of Angola’s oil wealth is saved for future generations under a sound and transparent governance
structure by pursuing over time a structural fiscal surplus. They also emphasized the importance
of clearing arrears, and unwinding the significant increase in the public debt-to-GDP ratio
projected for 2015. Directors encouraged the authorities to prepare the budget for 2016 based on
a cautious oil price assumption and a prudent level of spending while protecting social assistance
and critical infrastructure outlays.
Directors emphasized the need for expenditure rationalization and increasing non-oil revenue.
They called for concerted efforts to contain the growth of the wage bill, reform revenue
administration, streamline tax incentives, improve the quality of public investment, and eliminate
fuel subsidies while expanding well-targeted social assistance for the poor. Directors also noted
that careful implementation of a VAT could provide a more stable source of fiscal revenue. An
improved medium-term fiscal framework with the adoption of a fiscal rule and stabilization fund
would help reduce pro-cyclicality of spending and fiscal revenue volatility.
Directors underscored that monetary and exchange rate policies should play a central role in
rebalancing the foreign exchange market. They welcomed the move toward greater exchange
rate flexibility and measures taken to tighten liquidity conditions, including by increasing the
central bank’s policy rate and banks’ mandatory reserve requirements, and encouraged the
authorities to take further steps to address the remaining foreign exchange imbalances. A clear
monetary policy anchor, supported by improved inflation forecasting and liquidity management
would be helpful.
Directors welcomed the progress made on implementing the 2012 FSAP recommendations,
including recent steps to foster financial deepening and inclusion. They supported the efforts to
strengthen bank supervision and emphasized the importance of implementing plans to restructure
and accelerate the recapitalization of weaker banks.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summing ups can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3
Directors welcomed the authorities’ structural reform agenda and stressed that its sustained
implementation will be critical to reducing fiscal risks, promoting economic diversification, and
supporting competitiveness and growth. Priority should be given to making the labor market
more flexible, promoting private investment, improving the business environment, especially by
reducing bureaucracy, streamlining the companies’ incorporation process, and strengthening the
rule of law, and improving physical infrastructure and human capital.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
October 14, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Context and outlook: Angola’s macroeconomic environment is challenging. The oil
price shock has significantly reduced fiscal revenue and exports, bringing to the
forefront the need to address more forcefully vulnerabilities and diversify the economy,
and better manage oil revenue volatility. The authorities have taken important policy
steps to mitigate the impact of the shock: the revised budget for 2015 envisages a
significant improvement in the non-oil primary balance, mainly through spending cuts;
and the kwanza is being devalued, with international reserves being used to smooth the
depreciation. But additional policy adjustments will be needed as the economy adjusts
to what appears to be permanently lower oil revenues.
Focus of consultation: Discussions focused on policies to help achieve an orderly fiscal
consolidation while protecting the poor; address lingering imbalances in the foreign
exchange market while maintaining price stability; preserve financial stability; and
support economic diversification and inclusive growth.
Key policy recommendations:










Implement an orderly fiscal adjustment to avoid domestic payments arrears while
striking a better balance between current and capital spending rationalization.
Mobilize additional non-oil taxes, improve the efficiency of public spending and
expenditure controls, and continue reducing fuel subsidies, while mitigating the
impact on the poor through well-targeted social assistance.
Adopt an improved medium-term fiscal framework, focusing on spending rules and
a properly designed fiscal stabilization fund, to reduce spending pro-cyclicality and
safeguard debt sustainability.
Continue adjusting the exchange rate supported by tight monetary policy to address
imbalances in the foreign exchange market while containing the impact on inflation.
Strengthen the role of monetary aggregates in the monetary policy framework while
improving inflation forecasting and liquidity management.
Increase financial sector resilience by further strengthening bank supervision and
resolution frameworks, and accelerate plans to restructure weaker banks.
Promote economic diversification by improving the business environment and
competitiveness, and by strengthening the role of the private sector in rebuilding
infrastructure through concessions and public-private partnerships.

BACKGROUND
1.
Angola is a post-conflict country—decades of hostilities ended in 2002—with
significant infrastructure and human capital deficits. Oil receipts underpinned strong growth in
the last decade, but have also made the country vulnerable to oil revenue volatility. Progress was
made in reducing poverty rates from 54 percent in 2000 to 43 percent in 2008. However, inequality
has increased. Following elections in 2012, the government has embarked on a National
Development Plan (NDP) that puts priority on a large expansion of infrastructure spending to
support economic diversification and inclusive growth. However, spending is well below that
stipulated in the NDP.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK AND
RISKS
2.
Economic growth in 2015 is projected to slow to 3½ percent due to the adverse effects
on the economy of the sudden and sharp decline in international oil prices. While oil
production has recovered following the completion of maintenance work, non-oil GDP growth is
expected to decelerate to 2 percent in 2015 (the lowest rate since the end of the civil conflict). The
industrial, construction and services sectors are adjusting to cuts in private consumption and public
investment amid a more limited availability of foreign exchange.
3.
Inflation is projected to reach 14 percent at end-2015, exceeding the National Bank of
Angola (BNA)’s 7-9 percent objective. It already increased to 11 percent (y-o-y) in August 2015,
from a historically low 6.9 percent in June 2014, reflecting the effects of a weaker kwanza (given
Angola’s heavy reliance on imports), higher domestic fuel prices (due to ongoing fuel subsidy
reform) and, in the first half of the year, loose monetary conditions.
4.
The National Assembly approved in March a revised budget for 2015 consistent with
an overall fiscal deficit of 7 percent of GDP and an improvement of 15 percent of GDP in the
non-oil primary deficit. The revised budget assumes an oil price of US$40 per bbl but projects an
ambitious increase in non-oil revenue mainly due to improvements in revenue administration. On
the expenditure side, goods and services, fuel subsidies, and public investment are cut by
14½ percent of GDP, but wages and salaries increase by 2½ percent of GDP due to the hiring of
previously selected civil servants for the education and health sectors.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ANGOLA

5.
While the budget posted an
overall fiscal surplus of 1 percent of
annual GDP in the first half of 2015,
staff projects a deficit at 3½ percent
of GDP for the year as a whole as
spending execution is expected to
increase. This projection also assumes
an oil price of US$53 per bbl, implying
additional oil revenue of 5½ percent of
GDP compared to the revised budget;
staff is less optimistic about the
prospects for an increase in non-oil
revenue collection in 2015 as
improvements in revenue
administration are likely to continue
being offset by lower collections at the
border as imports decline. Total
spending is projected to be broadly in
line with the revised budget, but its
composition differs as spending on
subsidies and investment is higher
under staff’s projections.

have already secured or are finalizing negotiations on external loans from bilaterals (China, Japan)
and international organizations (World Bank, African Development Bank, AfDB), and are planning to
place a maiden US$1.5 billion Eurobond this year. They are also negotiating the terms of bilateral
loans with Brazil and China to reduce payments due in 2015 and 2016. If these plans are successfully
implemented, sufficient resources should be available to avoid the accumulation of new domestic
payments arrears in 2015, and to clear arrears accumulated in 2014 that had not been settled by
end-June 2015 (1⅓ percent of GDP). Given the projected fiscal deficit, a more depreciated exchange
rate, and the expected decline in nominal GDP due to lower oil prices, Angola’s public debt-to-GDP
ratio is projected to increase by 15 percentage points, to 57½ percent in 2015.
7.
Although the official exchange rate of the kwanza vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar has declined
by almost 30 percent since September 2014, foreign exchange market imbalances remain. The
BNA has used international reserves at a measured pace to smooth the devaluation, and adopted a
priority list for access to foreign exchange at the official rate, with higher priority for imports of food,
medicine, inputs for agriculture and industry, and the oil sector. The foreign exchange market,
however, remains in disequilibrium with the spread between the parallel and official exchange rates
rising from about 15 percent in September 2014 to around 65 percent in early October 2015.

8.
The BNA has tightened monetary policy, but excess liquidity in the banking system
remains relatively high. The BNA has raised its policy rate by 175 bps since September 2014, and
increased reserve requirements for kwanza deposits by 12½ percentage points (to 25 percent).
Despite these efforts, excess liquidity in late-September 2015 is estimated at ¾ percent of GDP, and
short-term interest rates on kwanza denominated T-bills, although trending upward, remain
negative in real terms.
9.
Given the economic slowdown, financial soundness indicators have been gradually
deteriorating with some banks showing urgent recapitalization needs.1 Non-performing loans
(NPLs) in the banking system increased to 18 percent of total loans in July 2015, from 12 percent in
December 2014. In addition, a few banks need additional capital and are facing liquidity challenges.
The BNA has already requested those banks to submit recapitalization plans and has been closely
monitoring their implementation, although progress has been slow.
10.
The linkages from the real sector to the financial sector are significant. As noted above,
commercial banks have been affected by the economic slowdown, leading to higher NPLs. The
linkages from the financial sector to the real sector are, however, more limited. Even in normal times,
the level of credit to the private sector has been relatively low, with banks channeling to the private
sector less than a half of their overall resources available for lending. As economic growth slows,
banks are further tightening their lending standards and this may delay, at the margin, a recovery.
11.
The external environment in 2016 is likely to remain challenging as international oil
prices are not expected to recover and risks are on the downside. Growth is projected to remain
stable at 3½ percent in 2016, with the oil sector growing by about 4 percent. The non-oil sector is
expected to show a small improvement with respect to the 2015 projection, growing by 3½ percent,
driven mainly by agriculture. Inflation is projected to slow to 13 percent at end-2016, with the effect
of the recent monetary tightening expected to be felt more clearly in the second half of 2016 given
lags in monetary policy transmission (see below). The external accounts are weakening as a result of
the sharp decline in oil exports, but imports are beginning to adjust, and international reserves,
though gradually declining, are projected to remain at relatively comfortable levels. The outlook is
for a recovery starting in 2017 but there is significant downside risk, including a further decline in oil
prices.
12.
Assuming an oil price of US$53 per bbl, staff projects an overall fiscal deficit of
1½ percent of GDP in 2016. Oil revenue is expected to reach 15½ percent of GDP, implying only a
1 percent of GDP increase compared to 2015 projections. Non-oil revenue is expected to remain
constant as a share of non-oil GDP as improvements in revenue administration are likely to continue
being offset by declining imports. Public spending is projected to decline by 2 percent of GDP in
2016, mostly due to a fall in the public wage bill as a share of GDP, reflecting a freeze in nominal

The Angolan banks showed relatively solid fundamentals at an aggregate level until 2014, but their balance sheets
have generally deteriorated in recent years, and some banks showed particular weaknesses (see Selected Issues on
www.imf.org).

Share of Oil-Related Fiscal Revenue (Percent)

Sources: National authorities, Bloomberg, and IMF staff calculations and projections.
Share of oil exports was calculated as the average ratio of oil exports to total exports of goods and services during 201113. Currency depreciation was calculated as the change of the exchange rate between the country's currency and the U.S.
dollar between August 2014 and September 2015. Change in international reserves was calculated as the change in gross
international reserves in U.S. dollars from August 2014 to the latest available data. For example, the latest available data for
Cameroon, Chad, Republic of Congo and Equatorial Guinea is April 2015. Share of oil-related fiscal revenue was calculated
as the average ratio of oil-related fiscal revenue and total fiscal revenue during 2011-13. Non-oil primary fiscal adjustment
was calculated as the percentage change in the non-oil primary fiscal budget (in percentage points of GDP) between 2014
estimates and 2015 projections.

wages and new hires. While public investment is projected to increase to 7½ percent of GDP, the
early formulation of an external borrowing plan will be important to avoid delays in the
implementation of the public investment program. The public debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to
decline to 53 percent in 2016.
13.
Non-oil GDP growth is expected to accelerate gradually over the medium term,
reaching 7 percent in 2020. This reflects the expectation of an improved business climate, a more
competitive exchange rate, and the completion of important projects, including in agriculture and
infrastructure. However, oil production is expected to level off at 1.85 million bbl per day, with
downside risks. Inflation is projected to decline gradually, and the external current account deficit is
expected to be reduced due to improved oil prices and import substitution, particularly of
agricultural and light industry products.
14.
This medium-term outlook, however, is not without risks. Angola faces the challenge of
balancing the pressures from lower oil revenue compared to 2010-13 levels and high demand for
much needed improvements in the country’s physical infrastructure and human capital and poverty
alleviation. This will require a better balance between current and capital spending rationalization,
making fiscal consolidation more sustainable over the medium term. The debt sustainability analysis
shows that Angola’s public debt remains sustainable but, at the same time, it is sensitive to several
shocks, including to the international price of oil, real GDP growth, and the exchange rate.
15.
Downside risks include lower oil prices, a disorderly implementation of spending cuts,
continued imbalances in the foreign exchange market, delays in the recapitalization of weaker
banks, and slippages in the implementation of structural reforms (Risk Assessment Matrix). In
the short term, lower oil prices should be met by increased exchange rate flexibility and tighter
monetary policy. Mitigating medium-term risks requires both improvements to the fiscal framework
and economic diversification.
16.
Spillovers from the world economy to Angola are significant, but from Angola to the
world or regional economy are relatively small. The main channel of inward spillovers, as noted
above, is the international oil price given the continued heavy reliance on oil for fiscal revenue and
export proceeds. The oil price shock is adversely affecting the fiscal and external accounts and
leading the economy to slow. Spillovers from Angola to the world or regional economy are relatively
small. Although Angola is the largest export market for Portugal outside the European Union and
several Portuguese banks are present in the Angolan banking system through joint ventures with
local investors, the magnitude of these interests remain relatively small if compared with the size of
the Portuguese economy. Angola’s trade and financial flows within Africa are still fairly limited.

Authorities’ views
17.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s overall assessment of the outlook and risks.
However, they project growth to be slightly stronger. They recognize the risk of higher headline
inflation in 2015 but have been taking steps to contain the second round effects on inflation of the
ongoing needed change in the relative price of tradables and non-tradables. While public spending

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ANGOLA

fell sharply in the first half of the year, the authorities expect an acceleration of the execution of
public investment projects in the second half of the year. The authorities mentioned that
preparations for the Eurobond placement were advanced, and they were aware of the advantages of
collective action clauses. They agreed with the importance of avoiding a general wage increase in
the 2016 budget but see a need for new hires in the priority sectors of education and health. In their
view, this could be accommodated by the elimination of “ghost” workers following the conclusion in
late 2015 of the ongoing biometric census of civil servants, and by higher non-oil taxes. The
authorities agreed with the urgency to restructure and recapitalize weaker banks and noted that
steps in this direction are being taken (see below).
18.
Addressing the imbalances in the foreign exchange market is a high priority for the
authorities. In this connection, the BNA has tightened monetary policy and, after a brief
interruption in July/August, resumed devaluing the kwanza against the U.S. dollar. The authorities
stressed, however, the importance of separating legitimate from speculative demand for foreign
exchange and noted that the priority list for access to foreign exchange has been helpful to
maintaining food security and social peace in Angola.
19.
The authorities agreed with staff’s debt sustainability analysis. They also see the need
for fiscal consolidation over the medium term to reduce public debt-to-GDP ratios. They stressed,
however, the importance of distinguishing between central government debt and state-owned
enterprises’ debt, in particular that of Sonangol, which is not guaranteed by the central government.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Living with Lower Oil Revenue
20.
Rationalizing expenditure and raising non-oil revenue will be essential to bring by
2020 Angola’s public debt-to-GDP ratio back to 2013-14 levels and to achieve over time
annual structural fiscal surpluses of about 1½ percent of GDP in line with the government’s
2
objective of saving part of the oil wealth for future generations while mitigating fiscal risks:

Rationalizing the public wage bill. The 2015 revised budget projects the public wage bill to
absorb more than half of total revenue. The public wage bill, as a share of GDP, should be reduced
in 2016 to levels consistent with the new revenue reality by keeping the wage bill unchanged in
nominal terms vis-à-vis 2015 levels and, over the medium term, by adopting cost-of-living wage
adjustments based on projected inflation; real wage increases should be aligned with productivity
gains and performance indicators.
2

The main fiscal risks facing Angola are: (i) volatility in oil prices and, to a lesser extent, oil production;
(ii) macroeconomic shocks; (iii) weak macroeconomic forecasting; (iv) weaknesses in public fiscal management
systems, including expenditure payments control; (v) energy subsidies; (vi) potential delays of oil revenue transfers
from SONANGOL to the Treasury; and (vii) contingent liabilities from state-owned banks and enterprises
(see Selected Issues on www.imf.org).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ANGOLA


Increasing non-oil tax revenue. Significant efforts have already been undertaken to
strengthen non-oil taxation, including enlarging the tax base; creating a single revenue
administration agency; strengthening tax inspections; and better enforcing real estate taxation.3
These efforts could be strengthened and a VAT introduced. If implemented diligently and in due
course, a VAT could provide a more stable revenue source for the budget, reducing the budget’s
dependency on oil revenue and shielding it better from oil revenue volatility.

Improving public investment management (PIM). This could be achieved through enhancing
compliance of the PIM process with existing legislation; prioritizing and monitoring the execution of
projects; conducting ex-ante and ex-post project evaluations; and improving technical capacity to
appraise, select, and monitor projects.

Reducing fuel subsidies while improving targeted social assistance to the poor. Domestic fuel
prices were raised three times since September 2014, leading to the full elimination of gasoline,
asphalt, and heavy and light fuel oil subsidies (Box 1). An automatic fuel pricing mechanism should
be introduced following the eventual elimination of fuel subsidies to ensure that subsidies do not
re-emerge once international oil prices rise. Stepping up the development of well-targeted social
assistance programs to the poor in line with commitments under the World Bank’s DPF will be
4
critical to protect the most vulnerable from the effects of lower fuel subsidies.

Formulating an improved medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF) and adopting fiscal rules and
a fiscal stabilization fund consistently with bringing by 2020 Angola’s public debt-to-GDP ratio back to
2013-14 levels and achieving over the long term structural fiscal surpluses of 1½ percent of GDP. An
improved MTFF focusing on spending rules and a well-designed fiscal stabilization fund—with more
flexible deposit and withdrawal rules—would contribute to smoothing oil revenue volatility and help
reduce the pro-cyclicality of spending. Further transfers to the existing oil funds (Fundo Petrolífero
and Fundo do Diferencial do Preço do Petróleo) could be suspended in case of an overall fiscal deficit,
as this adds to gross financing needs. Currently, only under strict conditions, these funds can be
withdrawn and with authorization from the President of the Republic.

Authorities’ views
21.
The authorities shared staff’s recommendations to rationalize expenditure and
improve non-oil revenue. They have initiated a biometric registry of civil servants which would lead
to the elimination of any “ghost” workers from the payroll. They see great scope to raise non-oil
taxation through improvements in revenue administration and have recently introduced fuel taxes.
They agreed that adopting a VAT in the medium term would be helpful. The authorities stressed that
3

Staff estimates that foregone revenue from the narrowness of the tax base and existence of reduced rates for
certain goods and services amounts to 2.7 percent of GDP (see Selected Issues on www.imf.org).
4

The Word Bank’s Development Policy Financing (DPF, US$450 million in funding and US$200 million in loan
guarantees) for Angola—approved on June 30, 2015—envisages actions on introducing fiscal rules; improving public
investment management efficiency; and developing well-targeted cash transfers to the poor.

Box 1. Angola: Fuel Subsidy Reform in Angola
In the face of rising fuel subsidies, the government has embarked on a bold subsidy reform since September 2014.
Fuel subsidies amounted to 5.9 percent of GDP in 2013 and are projected at 2 percent of GDP in 2015, with about
40 percent of this decline explained by higher domestic fuel prices. Lower international oil prices together with
three increases in domestic fuel prices led to the elimination of subsidies on asphalt, light and heavy fuel oil, and
gasoline. Diesel, LPG, and kerosene are still subsidized, although at much lower levels than in the recent past. The
cumulative increases in the price at the pump of gasoline and diesel are beginning to make the use of these
products more efficient. The consumption of gasoline dropped 10 percent in the second quarter of 2015 vis-à-vis
the same period of last year, while the consumption of diesel dropped 1 percent.
Most fuel subsidies benefit upper-income households. The richest 40 percent of households receive 77 percent of
fuel subsidies while only 10 percent accrue to the bottom 40 percent. The bias was particularly acute for gasoline,
as the bottom 20 percent received less than 1 percent of the subsidy. On the other hand, kerosene is widely
consumed by the poor; the bottom 20 percent received 51 percent of the subsidy. In any event, while the poor
consume less fuel products in absolute terms, removing subsidies will have a negative impact on their welfare as
they spend a higher share of their total budget on these products. Eliminating fuel subsidies would represent a
1
9 percent decline in the real incomes (direct and indirect impact) of the bottom 20 percent.
The authorities aim to continue reducing fuel subsidies while improving social assistance to the poor. They plan to
eliminate fuel subsidies by 2020 in line with Fund technical assistance recommendations. At the same time, the
government is expanding its unconditional cash transfer program (Cartão Kikuia) for the poor to a sixth province
with World Bank technical assistance. A total of 50,000 households have already received Kikuia cards (a monthly
stipend of Kw10,000, or the equivalent to US$75) to purchase food products, agricultural inputs, and other basic
goods at Kikuia shops or other registered shops. The authorities expect to distribute an additional 90,000 Kikuia
cards by the end of the year. The World Bank is supporting implementation of the national household budget,
income and employment survey to assess the targeting outcome of the program in 2016. In addition, it will help
prepare a detailed poverty map and will help the authorities centralize all social programs in a single register to
facilitate monitoring and evaluation. In addition, with EU assistance, the authorities aim to improve protection for
the most vulnerable, including allowances to families with children below 5 years of age, and then expanding this
program to include pensions for the elderly and disabled.

improving the efficiency of public investment is critical and noted that progress has already been
made on this front. For example, they have finalized and published a manual for project evaluation;
issued and started implementing a decree that allows for the monitoring of the physical execution
of projects; and are evaluating the public investment projects in the pipeline to assess which
projects are not complying with legislation. The authorities remain committed to continue reforming
subsidies, including on electricity, while expanding well-targeted social assistance to the poor. They
also agreed that a proper fiscal stabilization fund is needed and noted that they aim to introduce
new legislation in 2016 to suspend transfers into the existing oil funds in case of an overall fiscal
deficit.

B. Enhancing the Monetary Policy Framework and Strengthening Financial
Stability
22.
Monetary and exchange rate policies should play a central role in rebalancing the
foreign exchange market. The large imbalances in the foreign exchange market, if unaddressed,
could lead to a disorderly adjustment of the exchange rate, a sharp acceleration in inflation, and
bank losses given the still high level of dollarization in the economy (Box 2).5 Addressing this issue
calls for a holistic solution that includes further depreciation of the kwanza, moderate use of
international reserves to smooth out the depreciation, and tighter monetary policy supported by
fiscal adjustment to contain the effects of the weaker currency on inflation. Monetary policy should
aim at significantly reducing excess liquidity in the banking system by restarting open market
operations while pushing interest rates on kwanza-denominated T-bills to positive territory in real
terms. Adoption of this holistic solution would allow the elimination of the priority list for access to
foreign exchange at the official rate. The BNA should also work closely with the banks facing
liquidity issues on a plan to reduce and eventually eliminate their liquidity needs.
23.
The BNA needs to adopt a clear monetary policy anchor and should increasingly base
its monetary policy decisions on the evolution of monetary aggregates within a band
consistent with its inflation objective. Since September 2014, when the BNA effectively
abandoned the nominal exchange rate as the de facto monetary policy anchor, it has yet to adopt an
alternative anchor. There is a risk that its actions appear ad-hoc, undermining the BNA’s credibility
and potentially raising inflation expectations. It is thus critical, in an environment of more flexible
exchange rates, for the BNA to increasingly base its monetary policy decisions on the evolution of
monetary aggregates within a band consistent with its inflation objective. In this context, improving
inflation forecasting and liquidity management tools are important to achieving this objective.
Monetary policy transmission in Angola remains limited.6 Therefore, strengthening BNA’s monetary
5

Staff estimates the negative impact of 50 percent devaluation on the capital of the banking system to be about
4 percent of GDP. Although banks are generally long in U.S. dollars and their balance sheet would thus benefit from a
devaluation of the kwanza, they would also see an increase in non-performing loans in foreign-currency
denominated loans.
6

While changes in the interest policy rate are transmitted to the overnight Luibor and bank deposit rates, the
speed of adjustment is slow (see Selected Issues on www.imf.org).

policy instruments, while allowing for effective control of liquidity, and developing a track record of
meeting an operational reserve monetary target are essential.
Box 2. Angola: Exchange Rate Pass-Through in Angola
Exchange rate stability was a key feature of Angola’s disinflation strategy in 2010-14. However, the kwanza has
depreciated by almost 30 percent in the last 12 months as significantly lower international oil prices sharply
reduced the availability of foreign exchange in the country.
Assessing the exchange rate pass-through on inflation is important to help policymakers design monetary and
foreign exchange policies. Staff estimated for Angola the pass-through effects of the exchange rate to
consumer price inflation with emphasis on the evolution of the pass-through over time.
A Vector Error Correction model was applied to the consumer prices index (CPI), nominal effective exchange
rate (NEER), and trade-weighted export prices of the top import origin countries, controlling for international
food and oil prices as well as Angola’s output gap. The long-run and short-run relationships between these
variables were assessed using monthly data from May 2005 through April 2015.
In the long term, there is a negative impact of the NEER on CPI, with a weakening impact in more recent years
probably reflecting the de-dollarization of the economy. Specifically, a 1 percent decline in the NEER leads to an
increase in CPI of 0.63 percent in 2005-2010. However, the effect declined over time, to 0.49 percent in 20082015 and 0.34 percent in 2011-2015.

24.
The implementation of plans to restructure and recapitalize weaker banks needs to be
accelerated. Unduly delaying the resolution of problem banks could lead to disorderly bank failures
with potential knock on effects on the rest of the banking system and the economy together with
large costs for the Treasury. In addition, conducting rigorous stress tests with sufficiently adverse
scenarios (e.g., 50 percent devaluation and zero growth) to detect potentially weak banks at an early
stage would be very helpful.
25.
Financial sector deepening would help stimulate economic growth. The authorities have
made good progress on implementing the 2012 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP)
recommendations especially on governance, supervision, and resolution mechanism. Among others,
the recently approved Financial Institutions Law stipulated the creation of a Deposit Guarantee Fund,
the Bank Resolution Fund, and an inter-institutional National Council of Financial Stability.7 However,
more needs to be done on crisis prevention measures, such as the Emergency Liquidity Facilities and
contingency planning.8 Meanwhile, Angola’s capital markets together with its insurance and pension
funds are still small and their development holds a large potential to support economic growth by

providing alternative long-term saving options and financing sources. In this regard, an important
step was taken by the launch of Angola’s Securities Exchange (BODIVA) at the end of last year. The
Capital Market Commission (CMC) together with the Ministry of Finance is currently preparing a
regulatory framework for the secondary market trading of government bonds.
26.
The authorities have made good progress in strengthening the country’s Anti Money
Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework. A Law on
Criminalization of Money Laundering Predicate Offences has been enacted; and a Financial
Intelligence Unit (FIU), which has been admitted as a member of the Egmont Group, established. The
Financial Action Task Force (FATF) will soon review the recently-approved Law on Mutual Legal
Assistance and decide whether this law addresses the deficiencies of the previous legislation. This
together with demonstrating effective implementation of the action plan agreed upon with FATF will
pave the way for removal of Angola from the FATF grey list.
27.
Angola has introduced new exchange measures that could be subject to approval
under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3. They include: (i) the priority list for access to U.S. dollars at
the official exchange rate; and (ii) a special tax on transfers to non-residents under contracts for
foreign technical assistance or management services. Staff is currently assessing the jurisdictional
implications of these measures and of the high spread between the parallel and official exchange
rates. At the same time, with the adoption of the new private investment law, the authorities have
successfully eliminated one exchange restriction arising from limits on the remittances of dividends
and profits from foreign investments.

Authorities’ views
28.
The authorities agreed with staff’s analysis and recommendations. They received well
staff’s proposal to rebalance the foreign exchange market and, in September, the official exchange
rate was devalued again and monetary policy tightened further. The authorities also acknowledged
the importance of improving inflation forecasting and liquidity management to help attain monetary
aggregates as a policy anchor and requested follow-up IMF technical assistance in these areas. They
stressed the importance of continuing to develop their capital markets, and noted their full
commitment to strengthen the AML/CFT framework and, as circumstances allow, eliminate the
restrictions under Article VIII.

C. Promoting Economic Diversification and Competitiveness
29.
The need for economic diversification has become even more apparent in light of the
significant drop and increased volatility in international oil prices since mid-2014. A more
diversified economy would better shield the economy from oil price fluctuations and make growth
more inclusive. The Angola Invest Program initiated in January 2013 is the centerpiece of the
government’s policy to support domestic production, focusing on SMEs, by reducing administrative
costs and hurdles, including to setup new firms. In addition, new legislation was approved to foster
the private sector, including: (i) the Simplified Companies Incorporation Process Law, which seeks to
reduce bureaucracy and streamline the companies’ incorporation process; (ii) the new Private

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ANGOLA

Investment Law (Box 3); and (iii) the new Labor Law, which aims at promoting employment creation
and labor market formality by increasing labor flexibility for SMEs.9 Moreover, the government is
reviewing the Electricity Law to promote private sector participation in the generation, transmission,
and distribution of electricity with AfDB assistance. This is an important step as electricity supply is
one of the main infrastructure bottlenecks in Angola. Moreover, greater involvement of the private
sector in developing infrastructure to remove bottlenecks and support economic diversification
through concessions and PPPs could be pursued while managing fiscal risks.
30.
In addition, the authorities are implementing reforms to reduce poverty and
inequality. They are expanding their unconditional cash transfer program and are launching a new
program to improve protection for the most vulnerable. Careful coordination and eventual merging
of different social programs to avoid overlap, cut overhead costs, and increase synergies among the
programs would be important. Also, social spending should be protected in the forthcoming annual
budget to shield as much as possible the poor from the effects of the oil price shock.
Box 3. Angola’s New Private Investment Law
On August 11, 2015, Angola approved a new private investment law, which aims at reducing bureaucracy and
streamlining the decision-making process of private investment. The main changes include:








Reduction from US$1 million to US$500,000 in the amount required for domestic investors to benefit from
fiscal incentives, while for foreigners, the minimum remains at US$1 million.
Fiscal incentives are dependent on certain criteria: number of jobs created, value of investment, location,
economic sector, total destined to exports, share of domestic investors, and value added.
Minimum requirement of 35 percent domestic investor participation for foreigners to invest in strategic
sectors, such as electricity and water, hotels and tourism, transportation and logistics, construction,
telecommunications, and information technology.
Approval of investment up to US$10 million is now under the respective line ministry, rather than the National
Agency for Private Investment.
Investments above US$10 million still need to be approved by the President of the Republic.
Allowing capital repatriation for any investment value (previous limit for repatriation was US$1 million).

31.
Empirical models suggest that the real effective exchange rate appears overvalued by
10-30 percent (Appendix I). While the estimated magnitude of the overvaluation depends on the
specific approach employed and confidence intervals are generally large and undervaluation cannot
be ruled out, point estimates of the three approaches show overvaluation. Non-price
competitiveness indicators, such as the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Index, support the
finding of overvaluation.
32.
Restoring competitiveness requires addressing a broad range of structural
impediments. While exchange rate flexibility can contribute to improved competiveness, Angola’s
9

Some changes include (i) using fixed-term contracts for longer periods, with the maximum duration increasing up
to 10 years, compared to up to 36 months, previously; and (ii) reduction in overtime compensation as well as hiring
and laying off costs for SMEs.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

ANGOLA

still high pass-through to inflation limits how much nominal depreciation can affect the real
exchange rate over the long term. The most effective policies to address the currency overvaluation
are those that improve the country’s physical infrastructure and human capital and address its
structural competiveness problem, such as the weak rule of law and poor contract enforcement.

Authorities’ views
33.
The authorities are confident that the measures being implemented to upgrade the
country’s infrastructure, improve its human capital, and strengthen the business climate will
allow the economy to diversify, making growth more inclusive. They expect that the reforms
recently undertaken and forthcoming will contribute to an improvement already in 2016 in Angola’s
rating in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Survey. They also plan to expedite the procedures
and timing of issuance of work visas. The authorities agreed that concessions and PPPs can play a
more relevant role in the current environment and are exploring these options. They are also
considering restructuring or privatizing loss-making state-owned enterprises to help increase their
productivity and reduce fiscal costs to the Treasury. They emphasized the need to accelerate and
deepen reforms to enhance productivity and address the overvaluation of the currency while
maintaining international reserves at an adequate level over the long term.

D. Data Issues
34.
The collection and dissemination of economic data are essential for policy formulation
and business development and warrants high priority. INE’s publication of annual national
accounts for 2002-13 and the 2014 population census are an important milestone; as well as the
forthcoming quarterly national accounts, and the household, agricultural, and the multiple health
indicator surveys. It would be essential to publish comprehensive fiscal data on a timely basis and
expand coverage of the balance of payments.

STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
The Angolan economy has been severely affected by the sharp decline in oil prices
since mid-2014. A more timely policy reaction and comfortable level of international reserves have
allowed the economy to weather better the consequences of lower oil prices than in the 2008-09
global crisis. However, with oil accounting for over 95 percent of exports and about 75 percent of
fiscal revenue and the oil price decline expected to be permanent to a large extent, recent
developments underscore the importance of promoting economic diversification by preserving
macroeconomic stability and moving forward an ambitious structural reform agenda.
36.
Risks to the near term outlook are on the downside. There is considerable downside risk
to growth from the effects of lower oil prices. In addition, a disorderly implementation of spending
cuts, protracted imbalances in the foreign exchange market, delays in the recapitalization of weaker
banks, and slippages in the implementation of structural reforms could prolong and disrupt the
much needed transition of the economy from high to low oil prices.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ANGOLA

37.
The government’s timely reaction to the decline in oil prices by revising the 2015
budget will allow the central government deficit to fall to 3½ percent of GDP, compared to
6½ percent of GDP last year. Public debt, however, is projected to increase significantly to around
57½ percent of GDP, of which 14¾ percent of GDP corresponds to Sonangol, by end-2015, and
domestic payments arrears have re-emerged. Clearing arrears and, over time, reversing this sharp
debt increase will be critical. The 2016 budget should be predicated on a conservative oil price
assumption and be aimed at protecting expenditures on social assistance and critical infrastructure
while preserving fiscal discipline given that a recovery in oil prices in the near term is unlikely. It will
be critical to keep the wage bill in 2016 unchanged in nominal terms vis-à-vis 2015 levels.
38.
In the context of more limited oil revenue, expenditure rationalization and improved
non-oil revenue will be essential. Fiscal deficits should be gradually reduced and over time
structural fiscal surpluses of about 1½ percent of GDP per year should be pursued to restore policy
buffers and ensure that part of Angola’s oil wealth is saved for future generations. This can be
achieved if concerted efforts are deployed in containing the growth of the wage bill, reforming
revenue administration, streamlining tax incentives, improving the quality of public investment,
eliminating fuel subsidies while expanding well-targeted social assistance for the poor. Going
forward, a VAT should also be implemented.
39.
Monetary and exchange rate policies should play a central role in rebalancing the
foreign exchange market. The BNA has appropriately tightened liquidity conditions by increasing
its policy rate and banks’ mandatory reserve requirements. Interventions in the foreign exchange
market have so far allowed for a gradual depreciation of the kwanza. However, the volatile and wide
spread between the parallel and primary market exchange rates is an indication that an imbalance
still exists in the market. If unaddressed, this will likely undermine the official exchange rate as the
basis for price formation and inflation expectations, and lead to misallocation of resources in the
economy. Addressing this imbalance calls for a further depreciation of the kwanza, moderate use of
international reserves to smooth out the depreciation, and tighter monetary policy supported by
fiscal adjustment to contain the effects of the weaker currency on inflation.
40.
Preserving the health of the banking sector is essential to allow the economy to
recover over time from the current slowdown. The BNA appropriately focused its efforts to
strengthen bank supervision. However, efforts should not be spared in ensuring that all banks meet
regulatory requirements, especially regarding capitalization and liquidity. In this connection, the
implementation of plans to restructure and recapitalize weaker banks by their owners needs to be
accelerated.
41.
Economic diversification is crucial for the future of Angola. After enjoying the benefits of
international oil prices above US$90 per barrel for almost four consecutive years, it will take time for
the economy to adjust to lower prices. The authorities’ reform agenda tackles a number of critical
constraints to economic diversification by improving the labor market, promoting private
investment, reducing bureaucracy and streamlining the companies’ incorporation process, reducing
the time to obtain a work visa, and improving infrastructure, in particular, in transportation and the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

ANGOLA

electricity sector. Implementation of these initiatives will be critical to improve competitiveness while
making growth more inclusive.
42.
Angola’s macroeconomic data are broadly adequate for surveillance. Progress has been
made in improving the compilation and dissemination of statistics, but gaps need to be addressed,
particularly in the production of high-frequency indicators of economic activity, detailed and timely
fiscal accounts, and timeliness and coverage of the balance of payments.
43.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Angola be held on the
standard 12-month consultation cycle.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative

likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between
10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of
discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly. “Short term” and “medium term” are meant to indicate that the risk could
materialize within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

enforcing real estate taxation.
Ongoing. The authorities are already taking
appropriate steps to improve evaluation and
monitoring as well as the quality and efficiency of
public investment. In May 2015, a working group
was formed with the aim to effectively integrate the
databases SIGFE and SIPIP. The authorities have also

The variation registered in this ratio, Sept.-14 to Nov.-14, was caused by the considerable increase of nonperforming loans due to the restructuring and adjustment of the loan portfolio of Bank BESA imposed by BNA.

Appendix I. Angola: External Balance Assessment Update
While Angola’s external balance remains sustainable under current assumptions, the economy is
vulnerable to shocks, with an overvalued exchange rate in the range of 10-30 percent, and a level of
international reserves that is still comfortable but is approaching the lower bound of the recommended
IMF metric coverage. There is also considerable room to improve non-price competiveness.


The external sustainability (ES)
approach under the CGER, which estimates
the ratio of the current account balance (CAB)
to GDP needed to stabilize Angola’s net
foreign asset (NFA) position at its end-2014
level, suggests that the REER is overvalued,
and would need to depreciate by around
21 percent by 2020 to close the projected gap
with the norm.

The real effective exchange rate (REER) is
estimated to be overvalued by 10 percent
to 30 percent. Although confidence intervals
are large and undervaluation cannot be ruled
out, the different CGER approaches and the
new EBA-lite methodology tend to point
toward overvaluation:

Nominal Effective Exchange Rate 2008-2015

The current account is projected to
gradually improve over the medium term.
With lower oil prices, the current account
balance fell into deficit in 2014 and is
projected to stay in deficit over the medium
term. However, it is expected to gradually
improve supported by fiscal adjustment and
gradual progress in economic diversification.
Financing of the current account deficit would
come mainly from residents’ repatriation of
their foreign assets and external financing of
the budget.


The equilibrium REER approach under the CGER, which is based on the estimation of the
medium-term relationship between the REER and its fundamentals, suggests that Angola’s REER is
overvalued, and would need to depreciate by 10 percent in order for the gap between the norm and
the projected CAB to close by 2020.

The macroeconomic balance (MB) approach under the CGER estimates a current account
norm using some of the fundamental determinants of the ratio of the CAB to GDP. According to the
model’s estimate, the REER is overvalued, and would need to depreciate by around 31 percent.

The current account panel regression under the newly developed EBA-lite methodology,
which takes into consideration new variables that are relevant for Angola (e.g., the rate of depletion
of non-renewable resources), shows that the REER is overvalued. However, the degree of
overvaluation is highly sensitive to the oil price assumption. The overvaluation under the current oil
price assumption (US$53 per barrel) is 46 percent in 2015, but it drops to 21 percent under the
structural oil price assumption (US$74 per barrel) using a five-year moving average of the actual oil
price in the past two years, a mix of actual and projected oil prices for the current year, and oil price
projections for the next two years.

dollarized financial system, the country would
likely need to rebuild its international reserve buffer over the medium term to enable the central
bank to provide foreign exchange liquidity directly to the financial system in case of shocks.

The IMF reserve adequacy metric is equal to 10 percent of exports plus 10 percent of broad money plus 30 percent
of short-term debt plus 20 percent of other liabilities. For Angola, this would be the equivalent to US$ 16 billion
(5 months of imports) in 2015 and US$17 billion (5 months of imports) in 2016.

Non-price competitiveness assessment
Angola’s relative competitiveness has deteriorated according to non-price competiveness
indicators. The World Bank’s 2015 Doing Business Survey ranked Angola in the 181 position out of
189 economies, down one position from 2014. There are only five countries behind Angola in SSA:
Democratic Republic of Congo, Chad, South Sudan, Central African Republic, and Eritrea.

Safeguards Assessments:1 The first-time safeguards assessment, which was finalized in May 2010,
found that the National Bank of Angola (BNA) is subject to annual external audits by a reputable
firm and has taken steps to address the audit qualifications. The assessment confirmed, however,
weak governance and transparency practices at the BNA, including lack of timely publication of
annual financial statements. The assessment also made recommendations to enhance the legal
framework and independence of the central bank, and to strengthen the control framework in the
reserves management and internal audit areas. Since this assessment, the BNA has adopted
measures to enhance governance and accountability, including the production of its financial
statements. The 2009 statements were audited and published together with the auditors’ report;
the 2010 audit was completed and the results were published on the BNA website in mid-October
2011. Since financial year 2011, the BNA has been publishing on a regular and timely basis its
annual financial statements, which are subject to external audit by a reputable international firm.
However, the BNA has yet to provide IMF staff the related management letters on internal controls
issued by the external auditors as stipulated under the Safeguards Policy. Since 2010, the BNA has
introduced and consolidated several supporting bodies to its Board of Directors, such as the
Monetary Policy Committee, the Financial Stability Committee, and the Investments Committee.
The Board of the BNA has strengthened its internal audit function, and in January 2011, it
reconstituted its Audit Board. It also adopted in December 2010 guidelines for the management of
international reserves and in May 2011 conducted a first semi-annual internal audit of their
implementation.
Exchange Arrangements: The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. However, the de
facto exchange rate arrangement has been classified as a crawl-like arrangement since September
2014. The BNA closely monitors exchange rate fluctuations to maintain price stability in the
economy and frequently intervenes in the foreign exchange market by holding foreign exchange
auctions and through direct sales. The BNA receives foreign currency from taxes paid by oil
companies to the government, and also buys foreign exchange from oil companies who make
payments to residents for services provided to them in kwanza. Then, the BNA sells the foreign
currency to the market (either through auctions or direct sales), with special focus on the oil and
other priority sectors. The official exchange rate of the kwanza vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar has declined
by almost 30 percent since September 2014. International reserves have been used to smooth out
the depreciation, declining by about US$3 billion since September 2014, to US$24 billion in
September 2015 on a net basis. The BNA publishes the auction results and respective reference
rates.
Angola continues to maintain restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions under the transitional arrangements of Article XIV, Section 2. The
measures maintained pursuant to Article XIV are: (i) limits on the availability of foreign exchange for
invisible transactions, such as travel, medical or educational allowances; and (ii) limits on unrequited
transfers to foreign-based individuals and institutions. In addition, Angola maintains one exchange
restriction subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII, Section 2 resulting from the discriminatory
application of the 0.015 percent stamp tax on foreign exchange operations. The exchange
restriction on limits on the remittances of dividends and profits from foreign investments has been
eliminated with the passage of the new private investment law in August 2015. Angola also
maintains two multiple currency practices that are subject to approval under Article VIII, Section 3

arising from: (i) the Dutch foreign exchange auction; and (ii) the discriminatory application of the
0.015 stamp tax on foreign exchange operations. In 2015, Angola introduced new exchange
measures, including the priority list for access to U.S. dollars at the official exchange rate and a
special tax on transfers to non-residents under contracts for foreign technical assistance or
management services. Staff is assessing consistency of these measures, as well as the high spread
between the parallel and official exchange rates with Angola’s obligations under Article VIII.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
ANGOLA—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
As of September 30, 2015
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. There are concerns about
data quality and timeliness and efforts are underway to strengthen the statistical base, including through
technical assistance from the Fund and World Bank.
Angola now has several regular and informative statistical publications, reflecting significant progress in the
provision of data and transparency in statistical reporting. Progress has been the strongest in the BNA and
recently in the National Institute of Statistics (INE). Both now provide and publish much more extensive data
on a timely basis. Data delivery and publication from the Ministry of Finance could be significantly improved.
Data postings on the Ministry of Finance website include detailed revenues from the oil sector and diamond
and reports on public finances with a certain lag.
National Accounts: INE has released the national accounts for Angola for 2002-13. This is the first issuance of
national accounts in Angola and includes annual data on output, expenditures, and income. The national
accounts include annual GDP at constant prices using 2002 prices. The Ministry of Planning will continue to
issue preliminary estimates and projections of annual GDP (output) for few more years. A quarterly GDP series
is in production and is scheduled to be published in 2015. INE also publishes other important data bulletins,
including quarterly bulletins on business confidence, industrial production, and on merchandize trade. INE
completed a national census count in 2014. This is the first census in the four decades since independence. The
census questionnaire covered a substantial collection of information, mostly of a demographic and social
nature.
Price Statistics: INE publishes monthly reports on consumer and wholesale price indices. The CPI index was
expanded to include consumer prices in all 18 provinces of the country.
Government Finance Statistics: The timeliness and quality of government finance statistics needs to be
substantially improved. Revenue and expenditures are correctly recorded on accrual basis but some issues
persist when operations above- and below-the-line are reconciled. Of the utmost importance is that
consolidated and detailed fiscal data is published regularly (at least quarterly) in electronic format at the
Ministry of Finance web page. It would also be important to publish the data in excel—currently published in
PDF, rendering it difficult for analysis—and in nominal values (rather than percentage changes) and updating
the numbers as they are revised. Information on oil revenues is published monthly with great detail but it
would be more useful for analysts and stakeholders if it is published as spreadsheet instead of PDF images. A
detailed report on the evolution of oil revenues is published on a quarterly basis but with some lag. Thus far,
the Ministry of Finance reports on a “modified” GFSM 1986 by using an adjustor to reconcile numbers above
the line (registered on an accrual basis) with those below the line (registered on cash basis). In time, the
Ministry of Finance should start a comprehensive migration toward the GFSM 2001 standard.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ANGOLA

Monetary and Financial Statistics: Data for the depository corporation survey and the balance sheet of the
BNA have been revised with the help of STA technical assistance. The data are now based on the new
standardized report forms. The BNA delivers data to the IMF on a timely basis. It also publishes comprehensive
data on its webpage on a monthly basis. The BNA has also started to publish other very important reports.
These include a quarterly inflation report as well as its annual report (summarizing monetary and
macroeconomic as well as inflation developments), and a six-monthly financial stability report (assessing the
stability of the financial system).
Financial Sector Surveillance: BNA data on financial soundness indicators should be published at regular
frequency (e.g., 30 or 60 days after the end of each quarter). The usefulness of the BNA’s Financial Stability
Report could be enhanced by being more up to date, as there is currently a long lag between the period the
report refers to and the time it is published (e.g., the latest report, published at end-May 2015, refers to the
first half of 2014).
External Sector Statistics: The balance of payments and international investment position are compiled in line
with the recommendations of the fifth edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual. These statistics are
compiled and disseminated annually, with a lag of nine months after the reference period. A technical
assistance mission from STA on external sector statistics was conducted in July 2010. It noted that few of the
recommendations made by the previous missions had been implemented and that little progress had been
made in strengthening the compilation framework. The technical units are understaffed and there are
problems of non compliance with data reporting requirements by resident enterprises. The authorities have
made progress regarding the methodological soundness of classification of balance of payments transactions.
Nonetheless, some inconsistencies have been found, especially regarding the classification of transactions
involving arrears and SDRs. The IIP shows important inconsistencies with the balance of payments. Coverage
and timeliness of source data remain a major shortcoming. A follow-up technical assistance mission will be
conducted in November 2015.
II. Data Standards and Quality
The authorities are committed to using the General
Data Dissemination System (GDDS) to improve the
statistical system. Angola started participating in the
GDDS in January 29, 2004 and metadata were posted
on the IMF’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

Approved By

Prepared by the staff of the International Monetary Fund.

David Robinson and
Bob Traa
Angola’s public and external debts are rising but remain sustainable. The gross public
debt-to-GDP ratio rose by 6 percentage points over the past year, to 42 percent at
end-2014. This ratio is expected to increase to 57½ percent in 2015 given the projected
fiscal deficit of 3½ percent of GDP for the year and the effect of a more depreciated
exchange rate on foreign currency denominated and indexed debt stocks. Starting in
2016, however, the gross public debt-to-GDP ratio would gradually decline, reaching
38½ percent by 2020, mainly due to projected improvements in fiscal balances and an
acceleration of real GDP growth. While the projected path of Angola’s public debt is
sustainable, stress tests show that it remains sensitive to shocks, including on real GDP
growth, the exchange rate, and the international price of oil. Angola’s gross external debt
is projected to reach 28½ percent of GDP in 2020, from 25½ percent of GDP at end-2014.

ANGOLA

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Angola’s gross public debt is estimated at 42 percent of GDP at end-2014. Public debt statistics
comprise the central government, public entities, and (the external debt of) the state-owned oil and
airline companies (Sonangol and TAAG, respectively).1 There was a 6 percentage point of GDP
increase in gross public debt in 2014 relative to 2013, due to an increase in both domestic and
external debt. Net public debt (gross debt excluding deposits of the central government at the BNA)
stood at 32¾ percent of GDP at end-2014.2
In 2015, Angola’s gross public debt is projected to increase significantly, by 15 percentage
points, to 57½ percent of GDP. This is driven by the projected fiscal deficit of 3½ percent of GDP
for the year and the effect of a more depreciated exchange rate on foreign currency denominated
and indexed debt stocks. In February 2015, S&P downgraded Angola’s sovereign credit ratings to
'B+/B' from 'BB-/B' following the sharp decline in oil prices and, in August 2015, they revised the
outlook to negative. Moody’s revised Angola’s outlook to negative in March 2015. In September
2015, Fitch Ratings downgraded Angola's long-term foreign and local currency issuer default ratings
(IDRs) to 'B+' from 'BB-'. They affirmed Angola's short-term IDR at 'B' and also lowered the country
ceiling to 'B+'. However, they changed the outlook to stable from negative.
Interest costs are expected to rise in 2015 and beyond. With softening oil revenues and
projected fiscal deficits for the next few years, Angola would have to increasingly rely on market
financing, increasing its financing costs. In addition, if international financial markets become tighter
due to the “normalization” of U.S. monetary policy, the cost of external borrowing could also rise.
The main assumptions underlying the debt sustainability analysis (DSA) are consistent with
the macro-framework spelled out in the 2015 Article IV staff report. After sharply decelerating
in 2015, staff projects a gradual increase in non-oil GDP growth over the medium term, reflecting an
improved business climate and the completion of several projects, including in agriculture and
infrastructure. Inflation is projected to peak in the first half of 2016 and then decline gradually,
despite greater exchange rate flexibility, as a new monetary policy framework is introduced. The
medium-term GDP deflator in local currency, however, is projected to be significantly higher than in
the DSA carried out last year due to higher inflation and the exchange rate depreciation. The non-oil
primary fiscal balance is projected to continue to improve gradually over the medium term to
preserve debt sustainability given that international oil prices are expected to remain much lower
than in 2011-13. The current account deficit is projected to improve over time due to oil exports
recovery and through import substitution, particularly of agricultural and light industry products.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ANGOLA

Staff estimates a gradual decline in public debt as a share of GDP, starting in 2016, due to
projected improvements in the primary balance and nominal GDP growth. Over the next years,
in light of softening oil revenues, staff estimates that the government will need to continue its fiscal
consolidation efforts. Although challenging, this fiscal consolidation is needed to bring down the
debt ratio to levels close to the ones seen in 2011-13. This fiscal consolidation could be achieved
through additional efforts to raise non-oil taxation and expenditure savings. These savings could be
achieved by further reducing fuel subsidies, improving the quality of capital investment (which
would allow for a reduction in public spending), and containing the growth of the wage bill. With
improved primary balances and solid economic growth, the gross public debt-to-GDP ratio is
expected to decline to 38½ percent by 2020.3
Angola’s key macro variables forecast track record shows a relatively large median error
compared with advanced and emerging market surveillance countries in some years. This is
partly due to unforeseen developments, including volatility in either oil production or oil prices and
swings in agricultural production due to weather conditions.
The baseline debt path is vulnerable to various shocks, including on real GDP growth,
exchange rate, and oil price. 4 5 6 7 For example, a sharp decline in international oil prices can
trigger an economic slowdown in Angola as the government would cut public spending to offset
lower oil related fiscal revenue. Under a real GDP growth shock scenario, the debt path would thus
increase. Given Angola’s high dependence on oil, an oil price shock representing a 50 percent drop
in the projected price of the Angolan oil basket in 2016 was also considered. Under this scenario,
debt ratios would jump in 2016 and gradually come down over time although remaining above the
baseline path.

3

The residuals from the contribution to changes in both public and external debt are mainly due to further projected
exchange rate depreciation of the kwanza.
4

The real exchange rate shock assumed for Angola is 30 percent.

5

The interest rate increases by 200 basis points under the interest rate shock rather than by the maximum real
interest rate over the last 10 years to exclude the outlier resulting from the 2008-09 global crisis, which distorts the
impact of the shock on public debt.

The real GDP growth is reduced by one-half standard deviation (rather than 1 standard deviation) for 2 consecutive
years to tailor this shock better to the new reality of the Angolan economy, which has been growing for more than a
decade and has seen the share of the less volatile non-oil (services dominated) sector increase.
7

The oil price shock shows only the direct impact of a decline in oil price on revenues in 2016. The price under this
scenario is US$26.5 per barrel.

1/ Public sector is defined as the Central government plus public companies.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ EMBIG.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

ANGOLA

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Angola’s external debt is sustainable. Under the baseline, external debt increases slightly from
about 25½ percent of GDP in 2014 to 28½ percent of GDP in 2020. Of the various standard shocks,
the most significant is a current account shock. The second most significant shock is the combined
shock, followed by the real depreciation shock. The interest rate and real GDP growth shocks have
less pronounced effects.
While the authorities have taken steps to collect private sector debt statistics, there is still no
available data on private sector debt for Angola. Thus, the external debt sustainability analysis is
currently solely based on public sector external debt including, as mentioned above, two stateowned enterprises (Sonangol and TAAG).

and Mr. Amilcar Paia Tivane, Advisor to Executive Director for Angola
October 28, 2015

Introduction

Angola has witnessed substantial improvement in socio economic conditions over the past
five years, in spite of the heightening in downside risks arising from commodity price
shocks, the weaker global demand for commodity exports, and tightening financing
conditions. Like most resource rich nations, Angola’s long-term challenge is to seize the
opportunity from oil resources to build up its productive capacity, strengthen institutions and
promote human capital development. In this regard, the authorities are committed to step up
their efforts to advance the implementation of the reform agenda aimed at fostering economic
transformation and diversification, building economic resilience and strengthening policy
institutions.
The authorities are appreciative of the Fund’s continued engagement and policy support, and
value the candid discussions and exchange of views during the 2015 Article IV consultation
mission.
2.

Recent Economic Developments

The Angolan economy remains highly dependent on the oil sector. During the last five
years, oil production accounted, on average, roughly 50 percent of GDP, about 90 percent of
export earnings and nearly 75 percent of fiscal revenues. Given the economy’s vulnerability
to commodity price swings, upgrading economic competitiveness in non-oil sector,
particularly in agriculture and manufacturing, remain the main challenge to build economic
resilience in the medium and long-term.
The decline in the oil prices over the past several months triggered the growth slowdown and
led to a decline in sources of foreign exchange. The growth projections for 2015 have been
revised downward to 3.5 percent, from initial forecast of 4.5 percent. Growth in the oil-sector
is expected to reach 6.8 percent in 2015 following the completion of maintenance work of oil
fields, a significant recovery from a decline of 2.6 percent in 2014. Nonetheless, growth in
the non-oil sector is projected to decelerate to 2.1 percent in 2015, from 8.2 percent in 2014.
In the near term, increasing fiscal space for transformative infrastructure projects and lifting
up the efficiency of capital spending are paramount to accelerate the pace of economic
recovery.
The average inflation is projected to reach 14 percent in 2015, exceeding the Banco Nacional
de Angola (BNA) target of 7-9 percent. Inflation pressures reflect partly the impact of
depreciation pass through on domestic prices given the Angola’s heavily reliance on imports,
which represent about 21.0 percent of GDP. In light of increasing depreciation pressures, the
BNA has raised its policy rate to 10.5 percent in October 2015, from 8.75 percent in
September 2014. This adjustment in the monetary policy stance is a decisive step to mop up
the excess liquidity in the banking system. Furthermore, to gradually realign the exchange

2
rate towards its equilibrium level, the BNA is drawing down international reserves and
allowing further exchange rate flexibility.
The fiscal stance has been tightened to shield the economy against short-term vulnerabilities
arising from commodity price volatility. The National Assembly approved in March of this
year, the 2015 revised budget which envisage an overall fiscal deficit of 7.0 percent of GDP.
Assuming a conservative oil price of US$ 40 per barrel, the fiscal stance was calibrated to
lessen the impact of fiscal risks due to significant losses in oil-revenues. Specifically, the
total revenue was revised downward to 23.4 percent of GDP in the revised budget, less 8.4
percentage points relative to the initial budget. Similarly, the oil revenue was adjusted from
18.9 to 9.0 percent of GDP, despite the slight increase in the non-oil revenue from to 10.5 to
12.5 of GDP. The fiscal adjustment made in 2015 resulted in considerable cuts in capital
expenditure, reaching 5.5 percent of GDP, from 10.1 percent of GDP in the initial budget. By
the same token, current expenditure was revised downward to 24.9 percent, from 28.5
percent of GDP in the initial budget.
The current account deficit is projected to widen to 7.6 of GDP in 2015, from 1.5 percent of
GDP in 2014. This is mostly explained by a decline in exports of oil and gas products, which
is projected to reach 34.7 percent of GDP by end-2015, less 10 percentage points relative to
2014. In light of this, the gross international reserves are projected to decline to US$ 20.0
billion in 2015, equivalent to 6 months of import cover, from 27.7 million in 2014 (8.1
months of import cover).

Medium Term Outlook and Policy Priorities

The medium term economic outlook remains benign although the balance of risks is tilted to
downside. These risks include persistent negative oil price shocks, coupled with slower
growth in emerging markets, which accounts for significant share of Angola’s main exports.
Growth is projected to remain at 3.5 percent in 2016, with the oil sector growing by 3.9
percent, a slight decline from 6.8 percent expected for 2015. Growth in the non-oil sector is
projected to accelerate from 2.1 percent in 2015 to 3.4 percent in 2016, and to reach 4.2
percent over the period 2017-2018, driven mostly by a strong recovery in agriculture, and
improved supply of infrastructure. Average inflation is forecast at 14.2 percent in 2016, given
the gradual pass-through of depreciation pressures into domestic prices. Inflation
expectations are expected to remain contained in subsequent years in response to tightening
in monetary policy.
Fiscal Policy
The medium-term fiscal strategy envisages achieving fiscal consolidation while deepening
the implementation of fiscal structural reforms aimed to broaden the tax base, diversify the
sources of revenues and improve public spending efficiency. Total revenue is projected at
27.6 percent of GDP in 2016, of which oil revenue will account for 15.6 percent of GDP and
non-oil revenues for 10.1 percent of GDP. Public spending is expected to remain on average
at 29 percent of GDP in 2016 whilst the overall fiscal deficit is expected to improve to 1.4
percent of GDP in 2016, from 3.5 percent of GDP in 2015, mostly reflecting the scaling back

3
of capital spending and containment on recurrent spending, particularly wage bill and goods
and services.
Going forward, the authorities remain committed to invigorating the implementation of
ongoing measures to diversify the sources of non-oil revenues, and accelerate the pace
preparation towards the introduction of VAT. In addition, to foster fiscal consolidation and
maintain a sustainable debt path in short and medium-term, they will step up efforts for swift
implementation of measures aimed to streamline public expenditure; enhance the institutional
capacity on investment planning, implementation and monitoring; strengthen the financial
oversight of state owned enterprises; and improve the medium-term fiscal framework and
adoption of fiscal.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
The monetary and exchange rate policy stance in the medium-term seeks to anchor inflation
expectations and smoothen exchange rate volatility. Average inflation is projected to reach
14.2 percent in 2016, and to decline gradually to 11.4 percent in 2018, reflecting a gradual
tightening in monetary policy. In the medium term, the BNA will continue to fine tune its
policy instruments to anchor inflation expectations on the one hand, and allowing exchange
rate flexibility to prevent further losses in international reserves, on the other hand.
Furthermore, the BNA will continue to enhance its institutional capacity to improve the
effectiveness in conducting the monetary policy through stepped up efforts to improve
inflation forecasting and liquidity management tools with the Fund support.
Financial Sector Policy
Building a robust financial system and fostering financial deepening and inclusion are critical
to support ongoing efforts to accelerate economic diversification and transformation.
Additional steps have been taken to reinvigorate the implementation of the 2012 Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), with the approval of Financial Institutions Law, which
requires the creation of a Deposit Guarantee Fund and the Bank Resolution Fund.
Furthermore, with the aim of upgrading the capital markets the authorities have recently
launched the Angola’s Securities Exchange.
In light of potential systemic risks stemming from an increasing share of non-performing
loans (NPL) and the falling of the capital adequacy ratios in the banking system, the BNA
will speed up the implementation of the Financial Institutions Law, and policy measures
aimed at strengthening macro-prudential regulations and the financial oversight on the
banking system. Furthermore, priority has been given to strengthen the implementation of
AML/CFT framework, through the development of institutional capacity for effective
implementation of the Law on Criminalization of Money Laundering Predicate Offences.
Structural Policies
Fostering the pace of economic diversification and transformation remain the main objective
of the National Development Plan (2013-2017). In this regard, the authorities will continue to

4
increase the fiscal space for transformative infrastructure projects in energy, transport and
communications, agriculture and manufacturing sectors, and for human capital development.
Measures have also been taken to gradually remove economic bottlenecks, improve the
business climate, ease bureaucracy and streamlining investment incentives, and create
flexibility in labor market, through the enactment of a number of Laws, including: (i) the
Simplified Companies Incorporation Law; (ii) the Private Investment Law; and (iii) the
General Labor Law. The Electricity Law is currently under review to address efficiency
constrains and opens the sector to private sector participation in generation and distribution
of electricity.
Creating incentives to unlock the country’s economic opportunities and promote the
development of small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) is one of the cornerstones of
Angola’s diversification strategy. To achieve this desideratum, the authorities will invigorate
the implementation of measures to facilitate SMEs’ access to credit through the Venture
Public Capital Fund, revamping implementation of ongoing measures to simplify the process
for starting small business and simplify the structure of incentives in order to accelerate
import-substitution.
4.

Concluding Remarks

The Angolan authorities have made commendable efforts to mitigate the short-term
vulnerabilities arising from cyclical shocks while creating the necessary conditions to
gradually address the structural constrains to economic competitiveness. Going forward, the
authorities would like to reassure the Board of their commitment to advance their structural
reform agenda to foster economic transformation and diversification. Challenges remain,
particularly related to downside risks induced by commodity price and terms of trade shocks
and the weaker global demand. In light of this, policy priorities will be focused on gradually
removing the bottlenecks to economic competitiveness and productivity.
