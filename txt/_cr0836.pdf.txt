INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2007 Consultation with
Trinidad and Tobago
Approved by José Fajgenbaum and Scott Brown
August 17, 2007
Discussions. M. Alier (head), P. Berkmen, I. de Carvalho Filho (all WHD), and C. Schiller (FAD)
visited Port-of-Spain, during July 10–20, 2007. Mr. Samuel (OED) participated in several meetings
and J. Fajgenbaum (WHD) joined the team for the final discussions.
Regional Context. Endowed with large oil and gas reserves, Trinidad and Tobago has the second
highest GDP per capita in Latin America and the Caribbean, although inequality and poverty rates
are only at about regional averages. It is also a major regional financial center in the Caribbean.
Economic Setting. Economic activity remains robust. The balance of payments and the government
balance sheet have strengthened due to the high energy prices. However, the nonenergy deficit
exceeds the medium-term sustainable level. Inflation has declined but remains moderately high.
Political Setting. The political scene is divided largely along ethnic lines, complicating policy
making. The next general elections are due by January 2008.
Consultation Focus. Given the generally favorable economic situation, this year’s consultation was
streamlined. The consultation focused on the key policy challenge of implementing a prudent mix
of macroeconomic and structural policies to support an orderly absorption of energy revenues over
time, while taking into consideration the intergenerational aspects associated with the exploitation
of exhaustible resources. Special attention was paid to the authorities’ economic diversification
strategy, and developing a medium-term public finances management framework.
Past Fund Advice. Control of excess liquidity through increased foreign exchange sales and open
market operations, and modifications to the Heritage and Stabilization Fund bill have been in line
with Fund advice. Technical progress has been made towards implementing the recommendations
of the 2005 FSAP. The authorities have been less receptive to calls for lowering the nonenergy
budget deficit to medium-term sustainable levels, and introducing greater exchange rate flexibility.
Exchange Arrangement. Classified as a conventional peg. Trinidad and Tobago has accepted the
obligations of Article VIII and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and
transfers for current international transactions.
Trinidad and Tobago statistical database is broadly adequate for surveillance. However, some
data weaknesses need to be addressed to support the quality of economic and financial analysis.
Trinidad and Tobago began participation in the General Data Dissemination Standards system in
September 2004.

I. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

1.
Trinidad and Tobago’s economic performance has been remarkable in a
regional context and in comparison to other energy producing economies (Figures 1–2).
In the last four years, output doubled in U.S. dollar terms, net foreign assets have improved
by the equivalent of a year’s GDP, and public debt declined considerably. By contrast,
inflation rose and reliance on energy revenues increased.
2.
Economic activity remains robust, supported by the strength of the energy
sector, with signs that the economy is operating at full capacity (Figures 3–4). In 2006,
real GDP grew 12 percent, led by a double-digit expansion of the energy sector. Despite a
temporary reduction in energy output early this year, the economy is expected to grow by
some 6 percent in 2007. The nonenergy sector is projected to grow at about 7½ percent on
the continued strength of construction and manufacturing, and supported by government
spending and the expansion of credit to the private sector. Emerging capacity constraints and
labor shortages represent a downside risk.
3.
The external accounts are solid and net foreign assets continue to accumulate at
a rapid pace (Figure 5). In 2006, the current account posted another strong surplus—
26 percent of GDP—and FDI flows remained healthy, while portfolio outflows accelerated.
International reserves, including deposits in the Heritage and Stabilization Fund (HSF),
continued to accumulate rapidly, reaching US$6.5 billion. In 2007, the current account
surplus will narrow reflecting higher imports of capital goods related to large scale projects
financed with FDI. Net foreign assets are projected to turn positive.
4.
The government’s balance sheet continues to strengthen but the underlying
fiscal position is unsustainable (Figure 6). In FY 2005/06, the central government’s budget
surplus increased to 7 percent of GDP, its gross debt fell to 18 percent, and deposits in the
HSF reached 8 percent. The rapid increase in public spending widened the nonenergy deficit
to 15 percent of GDP—exceeding the medium-term sustainable level (Box 1). In FY 2006/07
the budget surplus is projected to decline to 4 percent of GDP, and the nonenergy deficit to
further increase to 16 percent, owing to higher public investment. Capital spending by public
enterprises has increased rapidly in recent years owing to investments in infrastructure for the
gas processing industry. Looking forward such spending is projected to remain high as
Petrotrin’s refinery needs to be upgraded to remain competitive. The government has
continued to work on a fiscal reform agenda to improve the quality of fiscal policy (Text
Table). Since the last consultation, the main development in this area was the approval of the
HSF Act (Box 2 in IMF Country Report No. 07/10).

5.
Demand pressures continue despite efforts to tighten liquidity conditions.
Strengthened monetary management and improved policy coordination with the treasury
allowed the central bank (CBTT) to regain control over liquidity (Figure 7). The CBTT
raised the policy rate to 8 percent in October (for a cumulative 300 bp increase since
early 2005). Open market operations intensified, the ceiling on CBTT sales of treasury bills
increased, and the treasury bill rate was allowed to rise. Foreign exchange sales were stepped
up reaching US$1.5 billion in 2006 and the unsatisfied demands for foreign exchange that
emerged in early 2006 disappeared. Liquidity management was also assisted by the
placement of TT$2.4 billion in long-term treasury bonds in the domestic market.
Nevertheless, bank credit to the private sector continued to grow rapidly (19 percent), albeit
at a more moderate pace than in 2005. The banking system remains well capitalized and
profitable (Figure 8).
6.
Inflation has eased considerably in recent months (Figure 9). Since October,
headline inflation fell from a peak of 10 percent to 7.3 percent in June, and core inflation has
stabilized at about 4½ percent. These favorable developments reflect the tightening of
liquidity as well as measures to increase competition in food distribution, including removing
the common tariff on a range of basic food items. There have been calls for price controls to
address rising food prices, rents, construction costs, and real estate prices. Inflation
expectations are not well anchored and wage settlements are starting to carry a cost of living
adjustment (COLA) clause.
7.
The real exchange rate misalignment has narrowed but remains significant. The
TT dollar appreciated 4½ percent in real effective terms in 2006 as domestic inflation
exceeded that of trading partners. However, improved terms of trade, increased NFA, and
rapidly growing public spending raised somewhat the equilibrium real exchange rate (Box 2).
Staff estimates indicate that the real exchange rate misalignment narrowed to 10–15 percent
from 15–20 percent a year ago. These estimates are subject to larger than usual uncertainties
given that Trinidad and Tobago is a large exporter of nonrenwable resources. For instance,

5
the fact that wage pressures in the nonenergy sector have been moderate suggests that the
undervaluation of the TT dollar may not be that large.
II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS AND MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK
8.
The discussions focused on the need to pursue macroeconomic and structural
policies designed to use the energy buoyancy to promote long-term growth while
strengthening macroeconomic stability. Special attention was given to the macroeconomic
implications of the authorities’ diversification strategy, and the need to develop a mediumterm fiscal framework.
9.
Fiscal issues. The mission stressed the need for a tightening of fiscal policy to avoid
overheating the economy, and for medium-term fiscal sustainability considerations. It
recommended that the nonenergy deficit be brought down gradually from 16 percent of GDP
projected for FY 2006/07 to 10 percent of current GDP in FY 2009/10, a level compatible
with medium-term sustainability.1 It suggested to start this process by targeting a 2–
3 percentage points of GDP reduction in FY 2007/08. To this end, the mission encouraged
the authorities to phase out fuel and utility subsidies while strengthening the social safety net
to protect the poor. The authorities’ indicated that medium term sustainability projections
may be too conservative as more gas reserves are expected to be discovered. Nevertheless,
the authorities agreed on the need to contain public spending growth from a demand
management perspective. They intend to save revenues above the level projected in the
budget supplementary bill and plan to keep public expenditure constant in real terms in
FY 2007/08. This would reduce the nonenergy deficit by 1¼ percent of GDP. The authorities
noted that fuel and utility subsidies could be reviewed next year.
10.
Public finance management issues. The mission recommended adopting a medium
term framework (MTF) to link the annual budget with medium-term sustainability objectives
and long-term development plans. The authorities expressed interest and are considering to
adopt such a framework with the FY 2008/09 budget. The mission welcomed the approval of
the HSF bill and recommended to follow successful international experiences in the
development of the HSF investment guidelines. The authorities intend to invest all HSF
resources in foreign assets despite the provision in this regard having been dropped from the
HSF Act. Regarding liability management, the mission endorsed the plan to strengthen the
debt management unit at the Ministry of Finance and the CBTT’s initiatives’ to promote the
development of local financial markets, including creating the conditions for the

6
development of a secondary market for government securities.2 The CBTT is studying the
possibility of diversifying the investment of the portion of its international reserves that are in
excess of optimal prudential levels.
11.
Monetary and financial issues. The mission commended the improved monetary
policy management, but noted that the risk of excess liquidity will remain a concern for as
long as the nonenergy deficit remains large. The authorities concurred and reassured the
mission that they are following developments closely. The mission recommended to resist
calls to introduce price controls and to discourage the incipient practice of introducing COLA
clauses in wage settlements. The authorities indicated that they do not intend to introduce
price controls, but that a plan to support the agricultural sector will be announced soon. The
mission noted that the banking sector health indicators remain strong but urged the
authorities to closely monitor developments in the nonbank financial sector, in particular the
rapidly growing mutual funds industry. Legislation to update the financial system’s
regulatory and supervisory framework will be submitted to parliament by year-end,
incorporating a number of recommendations in the 2005 FSAP (Appendix I). Draft
legislation to address the challenges identified in the evaluation by the FATF-style
organization of the Caribbean (CFATF) has been prepared. While it waits for approval,
compliance with the CBTT guidelines in this area is regularly assessed.
12.
Exchange rate issues. The mission noted that even after acting on fundamentals
through the fiscal adjustment described above, further real exchange rate adjustment might
be inevitable. Thus, the mission recommended allowing a nominal appreciation of the TT
dollar, as a means to accelerate convergence to the equilibrium real exchange rate and
facilitate achieving the CBTT’s inflation objective. The authorities concurred that a
correction of the real exchange rate will continue to take place. However, they noted that
supply side constraints are one of the underlying causes of inflation. They stressed, therefore,
that for a nominal appreciation to be effectively translated into lower domestic prices while
preserving the competitiveness of the nonenergy sectors, it would need to be supported by
the removal of infrastructure bottlenecks, particularly in transportation. The mission noted
that in recent years the real exchange rate measured by unit labor costs has depreciated
substantially, and therefore the industrial sector should be in a condition to absorb a more
appreciated currency, provided that wage increases maintain competitiveness. The authorities
questioned the usefulness of real exchange rate misalignment measures for commodity
exporters, especially for exporters of exhaustible resources.

2

These include creating electronic depository houses connected to a real time gross settlement system and to a trading
platform at the TTSE (Stock Exchange), dematerializing government securities, and making the CBTT only registrar of
government bonds.

7
13.
Economic diversification. The government has been very active in promoting
economic diversification to reduce dependency on energy resources. The mission
recommended to focus efforts on creating the conditions for the development of sectors that
are viable over the medium term without permanent government subsidies. The authorities
agreed in principle, but indicated that industrial policies are needed to promote
diversification. There was general agreement on the need to focus the government’s effort on
implementing structural reforms, addressing infrastructure bottlenecks, improving the
business environment, increasing regional integration, and developing human capital.
14.
The medium term outlook remains favorable and vulnerability to external
shocks seems limited under current policies (Table 7-Baseline Scenario). Under the
current outlook for energy prices, output growth would converge to 4 percent over the
medium term, but a key challenge would be to lower inflation. The current account surplus
would narrow but remain sizable, as the narrowing trade balance owing to higher imports is
offset by rising factor services income. The net foreign assets position will continue to
increase to about 60 percent of GDP by 2011. A large and persistent decline in energy prices
is the main risk but the high level of reserves and low external debt provide a comfortable
cushion to weather such shock well in the short- and medium-term.
15.
Stronger long-term growth with less vulnerabilities could be achieved by
tightening fiscal policy consistent with long-term considerations (Table 7-Policy
Scenario). Although current macroeconomic policies are financially sustainable over the
next decade, it would be important that fiscal policy be guided by intergenerational wealth
distribution considerations associated with the exploitation of nonrenewable natural
resources, which in the case of Trinidad and Tobago are expected to last for about 20 years.
The inflation outlook could be improved by facilitating a correction of the real exchange rate
through a nominal appreciation of the TT dollar. Under this scenario, a major fiscal
adjustment would be avoided at the time when energy resources are exhausted as the public
sector would accumulate sizable net assets; potential output growth would be boosted as
more space is created for private investment and the private sector access cheaper imports of
capital goods; inflation pressures would ease and bringing inflation back to international
levels in the short-term would be feasible; and the current account surpluses would narrow
faster but remain sizable, portfolio outflows would decline, and the rapid accumulation of
international reserves would continue.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
16.
Trinidad and Tobago is rightly aiming at using energy resources to reach
ambitious development goals before energy reserves are exhausted. Key to this goal is
the transformation of the energy wealth into a balanced combination of external financial
assets, and physical and human capital. The challenge is to implement a prudent mix of

8
macroeconomic and structural policies, as this is essential to support an orderly and efficient
absorption of the increased energy earnings over time.
17.
Long-term fiscal sustainability analysis and signs that the economy is operating
at capacity indicate that the policy mix needs to be adjusted by tightening fiscal policy.
For the short-term, staff recommends saving any revenue overperformance to help contain
demand pressures. For the medium to long-term, a nonenergy deficit of 10 percent of current
GDP is needed to prevent large policy reversals when energy income declines. A gradual
tightening is recommended to avoid disruptions in the economy. Staff recommends to target
a 2–3 percentage points of GDP reduction in the nonenergy deficit in the FY 2007/08 budget
and to bring it down to the level just mentioned by FY 2009/10. The recommended
tightening would ideally be implemented in the context of phasing out the current fuel and
utility subsidies while strengthening the social safety net to protect the poor.
18.
Adopting an MTF would facilitate this process and allow a more efficient
management of public resources. An MTF would assist in linking the annual budget with
medium-term sustainability objectives and long-term development plans. Staff welcomes the
authorities’ intention to request technical assistance from the Fund in this area, and
encourages them to start adopting an MTF in the context of the FY 2008/09 budget.
19.
Staff welcomes the approval of the HSF Act as a means to facilitate an efficient
transformation of energy wealth into financial wealth. The authorities are encouraged to
examine successful international experiences as they develop the HSF investment guidelines.
Staff supports the plan to strengthen the debt management unit at the Ministry of Finance,
and the CBTT’s initiatives to promote development of the local capital markets.
20.
Significant improvements in monetary policy management helped curb inflation.
The authorities will need to follow developments closely because, for as long as the
nonenergy deficit continues to be large, there would be a need to mop up excess liquidity to
contain inflation. Foreign exchange sales and open market operations would continue to be
the first line of defense, while continued policy coordination with the Ministry of Finance is
crucial to keep liquidity under control. Staff supports efforts to improve supply conditions in
food markets and encourages the authorities to resist pressures to introduce price controls, as
such controls are distortionary and usually ineffective. The incipient practice of establishing
COLA clauses (indexation) in wage settlements needs to be discouraged, as they entrench
inflation.
21.
The buoyancy of the energy sector inevitably puts upward pressure on the
equilibrium real exchange rate. A tighter fiscal policy stance and further opening the
economy within the constraints of CARICOM would limit the real appreciation of the TT
dollar. Monetary and exchange rate policies can affect whether the adjustment in the real
exchange rate occurs through nominal appreciation, or through higher inflation than in

9
trading partners. Staff recommends allowing for a more appreciated TT dollar as a means to
accelerate convergence to the equilibrium real exchange rate and to facilitate achieving the
CBTT’s inflation objectives. Efforts to remove infrastructure bottlenecks are important to
support this policy. The depreciation of the real exchange rate measured by unit labor costs in
recent years suggest that the industrial sector should be in a condition to absorb a more
appreciated currency, provided that wage increases are in line with productivity gains.
22.
There are no indications of external instability and the balance of payments
position is unlikely to give rise to disruptive exchange rate movements. Except for the
estimated exchange rate misalignment, other indicators of external instability listed in
the 2007 Surveillance Decision do not suggest the potential for such instability. The sizable
current account surplus is consistent with the need to accumulate foreign assets to smooth
consumption once energy resources are exhausted.
23.
Success of the government’s economic diversification efforts hinges on
adequately preparing the economy for the eventual exhaustion of energy resources.
Continued efforts are needed to create the conditions for the development of industries that
are viable over the medium term without permanent government subsidies. Staff
recommends focusing on addressing infrastructure bottlenecks, improving the business
environment, increasing regional integration, and developing human capital. Staff urges the
authorities to attach priority to submitting to Parliament draft legislation to strengthen the
financial sector regulatory and supervisory frameworks. This legislation is essential to ensure
a healthy expansion of this key sector, and achieve the objective of becoming an international
financial center.
24.
The staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

10

Box 1. Fiscal Sustainability1/
Medium-term fiscal projections indicate that the sustainable nonenergy deficit is no greater
than 10 percent of current GDP. Such deficit would allow the government to build enough assets,
before energy resources are exhausted, to finance indefinitely a nonenergy deficit constant in real
terms. The corresponding sustainable primary expenditure is 38 percent of nonenergy GDP,
substantially lower than the 51½ percent envisaged in the FY 2006/07 budget.
This result is based on the following assumptions:
•

energy prices as in the May 2007 WEO baseline until 2012, then they converge towards a
long-term value of US$45/bbl in real terms (in line with the oil price used in the budget in
recent years);

•

proven, probable and possible reserves are assumed to have extraction probabilities
of 100 percent, 75 percent, and 50 percent;

•

the real rate of return on the government’s financial assets is 4 percent;

•

energy revenue in the long run is 27 percent of natural gas and oil production value;

•

nonenergy revenue over the long term equals to 21 percent of nonenergy GDP.

The result is robust. The sustainable nonenergy deficit would be:
•

11 percent if long-term energy prices were 10 percent higher than in the baseline;

•

7 percent if only proven reserves were to materialize;

•

12 percent if probable and possible reserves were fully extracted;

•

8 percent if the real return on the government’s financial assets were 3 percent.

Maintaining the nonenergy deficit at current levels would involve a drastic fiscal adjustment of
about 25 percent of nonenergy GDP in the five year period after 2020. Given that the tax burden
on the nonenergy sector is in line with similar countries the brunt of the adjustment would need to fall
on primary spending.

Box 2. Real Exchange Rate Developments
200

At the same time, Trinidad and Tobago’s unit
labor costs (ULCs) have declined faster than
those of its trading partners, implying a
competitiveness gain in the manufacturing
sector. This decline has been more pronounced in
the nonpetrochemical sectors, allowing them to
mitigate the adverse effects related to the REER
increase. In contrast with previous oil price booms,
Trinidad and Tobago’s ULCs have continued to
improve in recent years.

The increase in energy earnings is the main cause
leading the appreciation. The energy sector
accounts for 45 percent of Trinidad and Tobago’s
GDP and 91 percent of exports. Consequently, the
energy sector buoyancy of recent years led to a sharp
increase in net wealth, thereby moving upward the
equilibrium real exchange rate. Given the de facto
fixed exchange rate vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, the
appreciation has occurred through a widening in the
inflation differential between Trinidad and Tobago
and its trading partners.

180

1980

The TT dollar has continued to appreciate.
Although the CPI-based real effective exchange rate
(REER) has presented low volatility since the
devaluation of 1993, the steady appreciation that
started in the late 1990s has accelerated in recent
years (11 percent since the beginning of 2004), and
the REER is almost back to the pre-devaluation level.

Econometric methods to estimate equilibrium
real exchange rates based on economic fundamentals suggest that the TT dollar was undervalued
by about 10–15 percent in 2006, slightly less than the 15–20 percent undervaluation estimated in
the 2005 and 2006 Article IV consultations. The long-run relation is estimated using a cointegrating
vector, estimated by the Johansen maximum likelihood method, based on the following fundamentals:
NFA as a share of trade, productivity relative to trading partners, terms of trade, government
consumption as a share of GDP, and trade restrictions index. The error correction term is also
statistically significant, indicating that the short-term deviations from the equilibrium tend to revert.
Although the TT dollar has appreciated recently, the sustained improvement in the terms of trade, in
NFA position and in productivity have led to a further increase in the equilibrium real exchange rate.

Appendix I. Trinidad and Tobago: Status of Implementation of Key Recommendations of
the 2005 FSAP
I. Cross-Cutting Issues

Status of
Implementation

Comments on level of progress, expected
implementation date, impediments hindering
implementation, other

A. Legal and Regulatory Issues
1. Enact the Financial Institutions
Act (FIA) amendments with a
minimum of further delay.

Partially implemented.

2. Require CBTT pre-approval of
all major acquisitions of, and by,
banks and insurers, and other
financial companies within
regulated groups.
3. Establish home-host
responsibilities for regionally
active groups consistent with Basel
Core Principles.

Implemented.

4. Introduce consolidated
supervision for financial groups on
basis of supervisable structures as
proposed in amendments to FIA;
Ring-fencing financial from nonfinancial activities.

In progress.

5. Consider an insolvency law that
incorporates a procedure for the
reorganization or administration of
insolvent companies.
B. Supervisory Issues
6. Enforce existing regulations on
connected exposures.
7. Require licensees to inform
CBTT of breaches of FIA and
other legislation.
8. Review supervisory resource
needs, with a view to making
supervision more risk-based and in
anticipation of the implementation
of the recommended amendments
to the FIA.

In progress.

The ‘fast-track’ amendments to the FIA have been implemented
with the passage of the Financial Institutions (Amendment)
Act, 2006, which came into force on September 4, 2006. These
amendments: (i) introduced an approval requirement from the
Ministry of Finance for mergers and acquisitions that result in a
financial firm controlling more than 10 percent of the market; (ii)
introduced fit and proper tests for controlling shareholders; and (iii)
allowed for more information sharing with other country
regulators.
Comprehensive amendments: the final review of the bill is
currently being done by the office of the Chief Parliamentary
Counsel and will be ready for review by the Legislation Review
Committee, a sub-committee of Cabinet in August 2007.
Included in the Financial Institutions (Amendment) Act 2006
referred to above.

A memorandum of understanding (MOU) has been signed among
regional central banks to facilitate stronger cooperation between
regulators regarding the supervision of regionally active financial
groups. The MOU establishes criteria for home-host
responsibilities.
The CBTT has made considerable progress in preparing a
framework for consolidated supervision. In the absence of
legislation, the Financial Institutions Supervision Department
(FISD) of the CBTT sought informal agreements with the industry.
The FISD has also conducted an onsite review of a framework for
consolidated supervision.

In progress.

During the past year, FISD has also been working with the resident
IMF consultant on the conduct of onsite examinations of groups.
He has been part of the planning process and has accompanied
examiners on site.
A new bankruptcy law has been drafted by the Ministry of Finance.

Partially implemented.

The CBTT has issued recommendations on connected exposures.

In progress.

This is captured in the new draft FIA bill, which will have the force
of law.
This requirement will be included in the FIA comprehensive
amendment. Until the amendments are passed, the CBTT is raising
the issue during onsite reviews and asking the banks to comply.

In progress.

Two managers have been hired and one more will join in August.
One manager transferred within FISD to strengthen the supervision
unit. More staff is likely needed in the future. Currently, the focus
is on staff’s training for adequate risk-based supervision.

30
C. Financial Stability Framework
9. Improve databases for better
monitoring country exposure risk.

Not implemented.

10. Establish a high level interagency Financial Stability Group,
and develop CBTT databases for
stress testing of market and credit
risk (particularly the development
of property price indices for
commercial and residential
property and housing and
consumer lending).

Partially implemented.

11. Clarify (i) terms and conditions
for access to emergency lending
facilities, distinguishing these from
arrangements for handling
insolvency, and (ii) procedures for
exit of problem institutions,
removing the reference to
forbearance.

Not implemented.

The databases for stress testing and real estate indices take
precedence.
At the same time, the central bank is also revisiting and reviewing
data needs and will enhance existing databases.
A high level inter-agency Financial Stability Group has not been
established yet, but the high-level Financial Stability Committee in
the central bank has been revamped. The central bank made
considerable progress in preparing the stress testing framework and
the project on property prices. Routine execution of stress tests for
the banking sector and later for the insurance sector still lies ahead.

On the agenda for next year.
Currently updating exit policy for financial institutions and
development of an exit policy for credit unions.

II. Additional Sectoral Issues
A. Banking
In progress.

The FISD has completed the internal analysis of how the higher
weights would affect the banking sector. However, since financial
institutions across the region invest in the sovereign debt issues of
regional governments, a decision was taken that a regional
approach to the treatment of CARICOM sovereign debt is
necessary. It is expected that a final decision on the treatment of
CARICOM sovereign debt would be made by regional Central
Bank Governors at their meeting in November 2007.

13. Introduce risk-based capital
requirements and a principlesbased investment regime for
insurance companies and pension
funds.

In progress for
insurance companies;
not implemented for
pension funds.

This issue will be covered in the amendments to the Insurance Act.
The CBTT is preparing the policy document for the Insurance Act
and drafting the bill at the same time. The bill is under internal
review at the CBTT, consultation with the insurance industry is
scheduled to take place in September. The amendments are
expected to be passed by the end of this year.

14. Introduce a stronger regime for
related lending and investments,
and rules for investment by
insurers in subsidiaries.

In progress.

These issues are covered in the new Insurance Bill and Financial
Institutions Bill amendments to the Insurance Act.

15. Establish a regulatory
framework for deferred annuity
products, demonstrating how
liabilities under these short-term
deposit contracts are supported by
eligible investments of matching
term and yield.
16. Establish guidelines to address
conflicts of interest in pension
fund management, and new
regulations to address indexation
of pension entitlements.

Not implemented.

Recommendations regarding asset-liability matching and to
deferred annuity products are given during onsite reviews.

In progress.

Development of the Occupational Pension Act has commenced.
Industry consultation is ongoing. Draft guidelines on Pension
Administration, Communication with members, Pension
Governance are currently being developed to address among other
things, conflicts of interest. There is no policy decision on whether
the new legislation will require indexation on pension plans.

12. Increase risk weight on lower
investment grade and non-OECD
sovereign exposure.

B. Insurance and Pensions

31
C. Securities Markets
17. Improve disclosure
requirements of mutual funds and
start on-site inspections.

In progress.

The draft guidelines for Collective Investment Vehicles (CIV)
were sent to the market last year, and a final market consultation is
to be held shortly. CIV companies have already begun presenting
data to the Trinidad and Tobago Securities and Exchange
Commission (TTSEC) and have been registering new funds in line
with the guidelines since the beginning of 2007. However, the
TTSEC has no power to enforce them until the Securities Industry
Act (SIA) amendments come in force. The proposed act is with the
government for approval. The TTSEC also has no power to
conduct onsite inspections until the amendments to the SIA are
passed, but TTSEC has made these inspections with all brokers on
a voluntary basis.

18. Bring the Unit Trust
Corporation (UTC) under the
regulatory purview of the TTSEC.
19. Review resource needs and
possible funding mechanisms for
TTSEC.

Not implemented.

Recommendations regarding asset-liability matching and to
deferred annuity products are given during onsite reviews.

In progress.

Immediate resource needs have been identified. TTSEC has
recently gotten approval for a more competitive compensation
structure for the non-management staff. In addition, management
had their compensation levels changed earlier this year. It is very

Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the Western Hemisphere Department
Approved by José Fajgenbaum and G. Russell Kincaid
September 10, 2007

This supplement provides information that has become available since the circulation of the
staff report on August 20, 2007.
1.
Recent international financial market developments. The recent international
credit turmoil has had no apparent impact on local commercial banks. The stock exchange
has also not been affected and the index is up 2 percent since mid-July. The exchange rate
has remained stable against the U.S. dollar and international reserves have continued to
accumulate.
2.
Inflation. In July, annual inflation rose slightly to 8 percent, from 7.3 percent in June.
However, core inflation remained stable at 4.5 percent.
3.
Monetary policy. The central bank maintained the repo rate at 8 percent in the
August 24 policy meeting.
4.
Fiscal policy. In FY 2006/07 the overall budget surplus is now projected at
3.7 percent of GDP, slightly weaker than the 4.1 percent of GDP indicated in the staff report.
5.

The FY 2007/08 budget bill was submitted to parliament on August 20.

• The budget bill envisages a small overall surplus and is predicated on
conservative energy price assumptions for 2008 (oil export price of US$50 per barrel). As
mandated by the Heritage and Stabilization Fund Act, the government must save at least
60 percent of the energy revenues in excess of budgeted amounts. If WEO oil price
projections (US$68 per barrel) were to materialize and all excess revenues saved, as in recent
years, the overall surplus would be 4.2 percent of GDP, compared to 5.2 percent projected in

2
the staff report. The weaker result is primarily explained by higher expenditure growth than
projected in the staff report.
• The budget provides for an increase in old-age and disability pensions, as well as
a scheduled increase in contribution rates; an increase in the minimum wage and those paid
under unemployment relief programs; and increased depreciation allowances to the
manufacturing sector.

Staff Appraisal
6.
The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged. However, the weaker fiscal
stance envisaged in the FY 2007/08 budget raises concerns as this would add further demand
pressures at a time of cyclical strength, and make it more difficult to achieve the inflation
objective. This underscores the need to save any revenue overperformance. Furthermore,
under current trends, the needed medium term fiscal adjustment to compensate for the
eventual decline in energy resources would be more difficult.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
Trinidad and Tobago
On September 10, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Trinidad and Tobago.1
Background
Endowed with important oil and gas reserves, Trinidad and Tobago has the second highest
GDP per capita in Latin America and the Caribbean. The energy sector accounts for over
40 percent of GDP, about 90 percent of exports, and about 60 of government revenues. In
terms of broader social and development indicators, its Human Development Index ranking is
above the regional average. Trinidad and Tobago is also a regional financial center and a
significant source of capital flows to sovereign and private entities in the Caribbean.
In 2006, real GDP grew 12 percent reflecting the first full year of activity of a major gas
processing plant, which brought growth in the energy sector to about 20 percent. Growth in the
nonenergy sector was also robust at 6½ percent, driven by construction, manufacturing and
financial services. Turning to 2007, the economy is expected to grow by some 6 percent,
reflecting a temporary reduction in energy output early in the year. The nonenergy sector is
projected to grow at about 7½ percent on the continued strength of construction and
manufacturing, and supported by government spending and the expansion of credit to the
private sector.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
The external accounts are solid and net foreign assets continue to accumulate at a rapid pace.
In 2006, the current account posted another strong surplus—26 percent of GDP—and foreign
direct investment (FDI) flows remained healthy, while portfolio outflows accelerated.
International reserves, including deposits in the Heritage and Stabilization Fund (HSF),
continued to accumulate rapidly, reaching US$6.5 billion. In 2007, the current account surplus
will narrow reflecting higher imports of capital goods related to large scale projects financed with
FDI. Net foreign assets are projected to turn positive.
The government’s balance sheet continues to strengthen. In FY2005/06, the central
government’s budget surplus increased to 7 percent of GDP, its gross debt fell to 18 percent,
and deposits in the HSF reached 8 percent. However, due to the rapid increase in public
spending the nonenergy deficit widened to 15 percent of GDP—exceeding the long-term
sustainable level. In FY2006/07 the budget surplus is expected to decline to 4 percent of GDP,
and the nonenergy deficit to further increase slightly owing to higher public investment. Capital
spending by public enterprises has also increased rapidly in recent years owing to investments
in infrastructure for the gas processing industry. Looking forward investment is projected to
remain high as Petrotrin’s refinery would be upgraded to remain competitive.
Strengthened management and improved policy coordination with the treasury allowed the
central bank (CBTT) to regain control over liquidity. The monetary policy rate was hiked to
8 percent in October (for a cumulative increase of 300 basis points since early 2005). Foreign
exchange sales were stepped up in 2006 and the unsatisfied demands for foreign exchange
disappeared. Open market operations were intensified, the ceiling on CBTT sales of treasury
bills was increased, and the treasury bills rate was allowed to rise. Liquidity management was
also assisted by the placement of TT$2.4 billion in long-term treasury bonds. Despite the tighter
liquidity conditions, credit to the private sector continued to grow rapidly (19 percent) albeit at a
more moderate pace than in 2005. The tightening of liquidity conditions and measures to
increase competition in food distribution led headline inflation to fall from a peak of 10 percent in
October 2006 to 7.3 percent in June 2007. Inflation is projected to continue to exceed that of
trading partners.
The real exchange rate misalignment has narrowed but remains sizable. The TT dollar
appreciated 4½ percent in real effective terms in 2006 as domestic inflation exceeded that of
trading partners. The impact of the appreciation on narrowing the misalignment was partially
offset by improved terms of trade, increased net foreign assets, and the rapidly growing public
spending that raised the equilibrium real exchange rate.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. Directors commended Trinidad
and Tobago’s strong economic performance, led by the buoyant energy sector. They welcomed
the robust economic activity, large fiscal and external surpluses, decline in public debt, and
build-up of external reserves.
Directors noted that the major challenge facing the authorities is to implement a prudent mix of
macroeconomic and structural policies to enable the efficient absorption of energy revenues

3
and to reduce the country’s vulnerability to energy shocks. They welcomed the authorities’
strategy of investing in human and physical capital to support the development of the nonenergy
sectors, while saving abroad part of the energy windfall. At the same time, Directors reiterated
their concern that the sustained increase in public spending and widening nonenergy fiscal
deficit, with the economy operating near full capacity, could exacerbate inflation pressures and
jeopardize fiscal sustainability.
Against this background, Directors supported a gradual tightening of fiscal policy. They
underscored that the nonenergy deficit needs to be reduced to a sustainable level. The ongoing
structural fiscal initiatives will be important in this regard, as well as expenditure restraint. Some
Directors recommended that fuel and utility subsidies be phased out, in conjunction with a
strengthening of the social safety net.
Directors welcomed the proposed adoption of a medium-term fiscal framework. They regarded
the establishment of the Heritage and Stabilization Fund as a key element of the strategy for
efficient management of energy revenues, and encouraged the authorities to emulate
successful international experiences as they develop the Fund’s investment guidelines.
Directors also supported plans to strengthen public debt management.
Directors commended the improvements in monetary management, which have helped to
contain inflation. They encouraged the authorities to remain focused on containing inflation in
light of rising domestic demand and labor costs, and to avoid price controls. They called for
better coordination of fiscal and monetary policies to improve liquidity management, and
stressed that wage increases should be linked to productivity gains rather than inflation.
Directors noted the appreciation pressures on the TT dollar in the context of buoyant energy
exports. Some Directors were in favor of a nominal appreciation, especially as it would also help
reduce inflation. Some other Directors, however, noted the uncertainties regarding the estimate
of exchange rate misalignment, and that nominal appreciation may have only a limited effect on
inflation because of local supply bottlenecks.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ emphasis on economic diversification, and commended
efforts to improve the business environment and spur investment in the non-energy sectors.
They urged continued efforts to create the conditions for the development of industries that are
self-sustaining over the long term without permanent government subsidies. Directors also
welcomed plans to continue to strengthen financial regulation and supervision, and to develop
the secondary market for government securities.

Statement by Pablo Nogueira Batista, Executive Director for Trinidad and Tobago
and Garnett Samuel, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
September 10, 2007
1.
The Trinidad and Tobago authorities thank Management and staff for their ongoing
support and for the helpful policy dialogue during the recent Article IV consultations.
2.
The Trinidad and Tobago economy continues to perform well and macroeconomic
stability remains well entrenched. Robust GDP growth has generated record-low
unemployment (5 percent), fiscal discipline has been maintained, and the external accounts
remain strong, facilitating the accumulation of sizeable foreign exchange reserves. In
addition, gross public debt now measures only 28 percent of GDP, compared with 60 percent
in 2001. Reflecting the good performance and prospects of the TT economy, the country
enjoys favorable international debt ratings of A+ and Baa1 by Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s,
respectively.
3.
The authorities agree with staff that the medium-term prospects for TT are favorable
and that external vulnerabilities are limited. Growth, led by activity in the oil and energy
sector, should remain strong, with an improving contribution from the non-oil sector. The
sizeable accumulation of external reserves and the low level of external public debt will
attenuate risks from a fall in oil prices. Inflation is expected to fall to 7 percent by end-2007.
Core inflation has stabilized at about 4.5 percent.
4.
As many other developing-country oil producers, Trinidad and Tobago aims to avail
of present favorable international oil prices to accelerate development. This is being done in
the context of the government’s integrated long-term plan (Vision 20/20), among whose
objectives are the diversification of the economy, the enhancement of physical and human
capital, and the reduction of poverty, all while paying due attention to the maintenance of
macroeconomic stability and saving for future generations. The authorities concur with staff
on the need to transform energy wealth into a balanced combination of external financial
assets and physical and human capital, supported by a prudent mix of macroeconomic and
structural policies. The authorities believe that this indeed characterizes their approach.
5.
The authorities are aware that in the context of a fast-expanding macro economy and
accelerated developmental thrust, inflation will continue to emerge as the major macro
economic challenge. In this context the major successes recorded in containing inflation are
noteworthy. Since peaking at 10 percent in October 2006, headline inflation has shown
steady monthly declines (except for July 2007) as a result of an aggressive approach by the
Central Bank on the monetary side, and the government on the supply side. To the end of
July 2007 inflation registered 8 percent, and the government is confident that the target of
7 percent could be attained by the end of the calendar year.

2
Monetary Policy and Exchange Rates
6.
Since October 2006, the Central Bank has redoubled its efforts to tighten liquidity and
reduce the growth of domestic demand, mainly by complementing normal open market
operations with stepped up issuance of long-term bonds, the proceeds of which have been
sterilized. Bond issues in the first seven months of fiscal year 2006/07 (October 2006 to April
2007) totaled TT$2.4 billion whereas there were no issues in the similar period of fiscal year
2005/06. This unprecedented supply of bonds along a wide maturity spectrum also provided
investment opportunities for institutional investors and will form a platform for the
development of a secondary bond market in the coming months. This is consistent with the
Central Bank’s objective of enhancing the financial and monetary environments to facilitate
more effective monetary management.
7.
Central Bank sales of foreign exchange were scaled up by 100 percent in 2006 to
US$1.5 billion to assist in liquidity control, and a similar total is likely for 2007 (US$1
billion). With tighter liquidity management, short-term interest rates and commercial bank
lending rates have trended upward and, with the slowdown in the tightening cycle in the US,
the differential between the TT and US short-term rates widened to 202 basis points in April
2007 from 174 basis points in October 2006.
8.
With strong growth likely to continue into the foreseeable future, the authorities see
inflation risks continuing to emanate from strong domestic demand, possible increases in
import prices, particularly food prices, and the pattern of wage settlements. On the latter
score, the staff has correctly noted that some wage settlements now include a cost of living
adjustment (COLA) clause. The Central Bank is of the view that its consistent policies and
clear communications will continue to bolster its credibility and help anchor inflation
expectations. The authorities are committed to scaling up bond issuance to regulate liquidity,
but will take other measures if necessary to achieve the established targets.
9.
The authorities welcome staff’s assessment that the TT economy exhibits no signs of
external instability. They note the evaluation of some misalignment of the exchange rate, but
also the observation with respect to the uncertainties in the analysis given Trinidad and
Tobago’s status as a large exporter of non-renewable resources. While a nominal
appreciation could assist the Central Bank in its inflation objective, in practice, results may
be limited if local supply conditions face bottlenecks, for example in distribution.
Fiscal Policy
10.
The government’s fiscal operations in fiscal year 2006-07 are projected to result in an
overall surplus of TT$ 1,268.7 million compared with a surplus of TT$ 28.5 million forecast
in the budget. Expenditure in 2006–07 included the allocation of TT$ 2,030.2 million to the
Heritage and Stabilization Fund, the vehicle established for saving for future generations.

3
With this allocation, total savings in the HSF now stands at US$1,396 million or 8 percent of
GDP. The government has also taken the decision to save the over-performance in fiscal
2006–07 in the HSF.
11.
The government notes staff’s recommendation to reduce the non-energy deficit for
demand management and fiscal sustainability considerations. As staff observes, the
government’s intention is to reduce the non-energy deficit to 10 percent by 2010. At present,
however, the more pressing considerations for curtailing expenditure seem to be demand
management and spending efficiency reasons, as plans for a new fiscal regime for the oil
sector hold the promise of significant new discoveries of oil and gas. For fiscal 2007–08,
government expenditure is budgeted to increase by 7.6 percent, which is marginally above
projected annual inflation. The expenditure budget for fiscal 2008 contains settlement of
salary arrears that cannot be postponed much longer. In addition, in keeping with
developmental and social objectives considerable attention is being given to improving
infrastructure, education and health.
12.
Nevertheless, the government is also aware that removing supply bottlenecks has an
important role to play in alleviating emerging demand pressures as capacity constraints
intensify. Efforts by the government on the supply side have played an important part in the
success against inflation since October 2006. These efforts included measures to increase
competition in food distribution and improving marketing arrangements for agricultural
goods. In addition, the government removed the common external tariff on a range of basic
food items. The government sees room for further improvement of supply conditions. The
budget for 2007–08 proposes a substantial increase on the focus on agriculture production to
further impact food price inflation. While, as can be expected in a situation of rapidly rising
prices, especially for food, calls have emanated from certain sectors of the population for the
introduction of price controls, the government has no intention of taking this path.
Structural Policies
Saving for the future
13.
In March 2007, the Heritage and Stabilization Fund (HSF) replaced the Interim
Revenue Stabilization Fund, which existed since 2000. Modeled on best practices for
commodity funds worldwide, the HSF will be used to accumulate savings from the country’s
exhaustible oil and gas assets for future generations as well as insulate the economy from
swings in international oil and gas prices. Governance structures are already in place. As
mentioned above, the HSF now contains US$1,396 million.
Public Financial Management
14.
The authorities are grateful to staff for the useful analysis of fiscal procedures
undertaken during the mission. They have already begun elaborating a proposal for Fund
technical advice in implementing the recommendations. It is hoped that by fiscal year

4
2008/09 the budget could be presented in the context of a medium-term framework. On
another note, the tax administration system will be enhanced by the coming on stream of a
Revenue Authority in September 2007.
Dealing with capacity constraints
15.
The government is taking a multi-faceted approach to treating the problem of capacity
constraints. One approach is the importation of labor through the CARICOM movement of
labor mechanism. Labor inflows are expected to intensify as more skill categories are
included in the movement of labor provisions of CARICOM. The authorities have also
embarked on an intensive and wide-ranging program to expand the labor force in certain skill
areas, which includes training for the young and on the job training.
The business climate
16.
The authorities continue to take measures to enhance the business climate. The
government is accelerating the implementation of the National Information and
Communication Technology Plan and the liberalization of the telecommunications sector.
Following the passage of the Fair Trading Act in 2006, a Fair Trading Commission is now
being established. A Bill has already been presented to Parliament seeking to review the
bankruptcy legislation to facilitate debt restructuring of ailing businesses. Customs processes
are being updated by the introduction of ASYCUDA++ and the electronic processing of
customs entries.
