Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation, Second Review under
the Stand-By Arrangement, and Request for Waiver of Applicability
Prepared by Middle East and Central Asia and
Policy Development and Review Departments
Approved by Mohsin S. Khan and Martin Fetherston
March 17, 2004
• Discussions on the Article IV consultation and the second review under the Stand-By Arrangement
(SBA) were held in Amman during October 29–November 12, 2003, and February 8–19, 2004. The
staff comprised Messrs. Mansur (head), Mongardini, Poddar, and Rayner (all MCD), Ms. Zakharova
(FAD), Mr. Geadah (MFD), and Mr. Feler (PDR). Mr. Shaalan and Mr. Shbikat (all OED) participated
in the policy discussions in November 2003 and February 2004, respectively.
• The mission conducted policy discussions with the prime minister, the deputy prime minister, the
minister of finance, and the governor of the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ). It met with the ministers of
energy, planning, telecommunications and information technology, and tourism; officials of the Social
Security Corporation (SSC) and the privatization commission; and representatives of the business
community, academia, and the press. The authorities have recently participated in an FSAP
assessment, headed by Mr. Musalem (WB) and Mr. Geadah (MFD). The FSSA is summarized in
Section III.C and Box 1. Jordan accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Section 2, 3, and 4 in 1997,
and the exchange system remains free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current
international transactions.
• The SBA in the amount equivalent to SDR 85.28 million (50 percent of quota) was approved in July
2002. Jordan’s outstanding use of Fund resources at end-January 2004 was equivalent to
SDR 279.3 million or 163.8 percent of quota (Appendix I). Following the approval of the SBA, the
Paris Club granted an exit rescheduling to Jordan covering obligations on pre-cutoff date debt through
2007. In view of the stronger balance of payments position, the authorities have not used Fund
resources after the completion of the first review and plan to treat the remainder of the arrangement as
precautionary. The accompanying selected issues paper includes an analysis of the authorities fiscal
strategy, a comprehensive debt sustainability analysis, and a chapter on the impact on Jordan of the
elimination of quotas under the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing.
• The World Bank is supporting structural reforms with a second Public Sector Reform Loan (PSRL2)
in the amount of $120 million (Appendix II). The timeliness and coverage of macroeconomic data are
generally sufficient for program monitoring (Appendix III).
• The authorities have consented to the publication of the letter of intent and the PIN and will consider
publication of the staff report after it is issued to the Executive Board.

Executive Summary
Background: Recent economic developments point to performance in line with or exceeding
program targets. Real GDP grew by 3.2 percent in 2003, despite the disruption of exports to
Iraq. The overall fiscal deficit for 2003 was 1½ percent of GDP less than programmed,
reflecting strong efforts by the government to contain spending in the last two months of
2003. However, the postponement of spending of about 1 percent of GDP to 2004 makes the
attainment of the 2004 fiscal deficit target more difficult. The external current account
registered a large surplus. As a result, gross usable reserves of the Central Bank of Jordan
(CBJ) reached $4.7 billion at end-2003, and monetary aggregates expanded rapidly. The
Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) report highlighted that, while Jordan has
currently no substantial financial vulnerabilities, a significant portion of the banking system
is undercapitalized. The FSSA points to the need to improve the framework for bank
resolution and to deal with undercapitalized banks in a transparent manner.
Article IV discussions: A sustained reduction in the heavy central government debt
burden remains the main challenge for the medium term. The mission helped update the
authorities’ fiscal strategy with a view to sustaining the reduction in government debt
envisaged under the strategy and rebalancing its composition in favor of domestic debt over
the medium term. The success of the fiscal strategy hinges mainly on increasing petroleum
product prices with a view to fully compensating for the loss of the Iraqi oil grants and
further reforms of the tax system and its administration. In particular, the authorities have
agreed to further reforms of tax administration along the lines of FAD technical assistance.
The mission reviewed the authorities’ plans to deal with the undercapitalized banks and
underscored the importance of resolving this problem expeditiously. The authorities
maintained that the case for a shift to a more flexible regime was not clear cut, and they
underscored the vulnerability of public debt to adverse exchange rate movements. They also
felt that shifting to a more flexible exchange rate regime was premature at the present time,
arguing that the ensuing uncertainty would likely undermine the ongoing, but still fragile,
recovery and complicate the already challenging economic policy agenda.
Program discussions: Agreement was reached on the macroframework and the budget for
2004. The authorities have reaffirmed their commitment to raise the price of petroleum
products and increase other taxes in April 2004 to achieve the fiscal deficit target of
3.9 percent of GDP, but the postponement of additional spending (1 percent of GDP) from
2003 can only be absorbed if additional external grants materialize. The discussions with the
CBJ centered on the health of the banking system and the recent strengthening of banking
supervision.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
In the attached letter, the Jordanian authorities request completion of the second
review under the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) and a waiver of applicability for endMarch 2004 performance criteria. The attached Memorandum on Economic and Financial
Policies (MEFP) describes developments in 2003 and the macroeconomic policies and
structural reform agenda for 2004. All 2003 quantitative performance criteria were met by
large margins and all structural benchmarks were implemented. Given the stronger-thanexpected balance of payments position, the authorities intend to treat the remainder of the
SBA as precautionary. They have also agreed to a Post-Program Monitoring following the
completion of the current SBA. The discussions on the second review lasted longer than
anticipated, as the authorities needed time to make progress on pension reform.
2.
The election of a new lower house of parliament in June 2003 produced a large
majority supportive of the authorities’ reform agenda. Following the election, a new
government was formed in October 2003, headed by Prime Minister Al-Fayez, with a
mandate to deepen the democratic process, reduce unemployment, and alleviate poverty. The
emphasis on macroeconomic stability, the reduction of public debt, and the momentum on
structural reforms, is not expected to change under the new government.
3.
The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on
April 29, 2002. At that time, Directors welcomed the robust economic performance in 2001
and noted that this owed much to the authorities’ prudent macroeconomic policies and the
solid implementation of structural reforms. They stressed that the peg to the U.S. dollar and
the supporting monetary policy had been effective in bringing inflation down to industrial
country levels, fostering confidence in the Jordanian dinar. They encouraged further trade
liberalization and privatization and called for a sustained increase in the tax effort. The
authorities have since eliminated tariffs on industrial inputs, privatized a number of stateowned enterprises, and widened the income and sales tax base and increased certain tax rates.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Recent economic developments point to a recovery from the disruptions caused
by the war in Iraq (MEFP, paragraph 2). Real GDP growth slowed down to 3 percent in
the first nine months of 2003, due to the disruption of exports to Iraq and the negative effects
of the conflict on tourism and transportation. Economic growth picked up to 3.5 percent in
the fourth quarter of 2003, supported by a strong rebound in export growth (Figure 1),
particularly from exports to the United States from the Qualified

Industrial Zones (QIZs).1 A fiscal stimulus through
higher public spending funded through grants also
contributed to the recovery in domestic demand. The
index of leading indicators of economic activity points
to a further recovery through June 2004 (Figure 2).
Inflation remains subdued in 2003, despite the
depreciation of the Jordanian dinar against the euro and
the yen. The Amman Stock Exchange reached record
highs in February 2004 and market capitalization
increased to 117 percent of GDP in 2003 (Figure 3),
but the average price/earnings ratio is in line with the
ratio in equity markets in advanced economies.
Unemployment, however, remains high at
13.9 percent because of the rapid growth of the labor
force and an increased participation rate.

payments to compensate economic sectors affected
by the war in Iraq. In particular, the authorities implemented spending cuts of JD 70 million
committed but not executed by the previous government, issued a special order stopping all
expenditure authorizations effected December 15, 2003, and made a strong drive for
collection of nontax revenue. The fiscal outturn was also helped by the delay in settling
payments to Iraq (1 percent of GDP).2 Budgetary revenues were somewhat less than

programmed, with higher tax revenues only partly
offsetting nontax revenue shortfalls. In particular,
general sales tax (GST) collections increased strongly,
boosted by high import growth and improved revenue
administration (Figure 5). Capital spending was
boosted by 39 percent in 2003 from the level of
spending in the preceding year to offset the slack in
the domestic demand in the aftermath of the Iraq war.
The Treasury Single Account, a structural benchmark
under the program, was implemented on December 1,
2003.

Progress on the public debt front was influenced by heavy valuation losses and
slower GDP growth. Notwithstanding the lower-than-programmed fiscal deficit,
government and government-guaranteed debt increased by 1 percentage point to
101.5 percent of GDP at end-2003. This reflected valuation losses equivalent to 6 percentage
points of GDP in 2003, associated with the depreciation of the U.S. dollar, to which the
Jordan dinar (JD) is pegged, against other major currencies. The deficit and net debt of the
consolidated public sector recorded improvements due to the strengthened position of the
Social Security Corporation (SSC) and the CBJ. The consolidated public sector fiscal balance
registered a surplus of 1.4 percent of GDP in 2003, and the public debt ratio declined by
1 percentage point to 59.7 percent of GDP in 2003 (Text Table 1). In line with its new fiscal
funding strategy, the government prepaid its outstanding stock of Par Brady Bonds
($456 million, including $185 million of collateral) in December 2003, which was financed
through the issuance of domestic bonds and a drawdown of international reserves, thus
reducing the external debt burden. The government also signed a debt-for-equity swap with a
major bilateral donor in December 2003, resulting in a further reduction in external debt of
JD 94 million (1.3 percent of GDP).
7.
The external current account registered a large surplus in 2003, reflecting a
surge in grant receipts and the underlying strength of the balance of payments (MEFP,
paragraph 5). Total exports grew by an annual rate of 8.2 percent in 2003, despite the
disruption of exports to Iraq during the war and cancellation of export orders in the period
preceding the war. Nontraditional exports fared particularly well, including textiles and
apparel, mainly to the U.S. market. Re-export activity to Iraq rebounded strongly in the fourth
quarter. The strong export performance was offset by faster-than-anticipated import growth
(10.8 percent). Tourism receipts started to recover in the third quarter due to an increase of
regional visitors and official and business travels related to the situation in Iraq, while
remittances grew by 4.3 percent. With grant receipts of almost $1.3 billion (13 percent

of GDP), the external current account surplus was equivalent to 11.1 percent of GDP.
Meanwhile, new external borrowing by the public sector was reduced significantly, in line
with the new fiscal funding strategy and private capital (net) registered a strong inflow of
$694 million. As a result, gross official reserves increased by $1.2 billion to reach
$4.7 billion at end-September 2003 (Figure 6), equivalent to about 10 months of prospective
import. The real effective exchange rate depreciated by 8.3 percent in 2003 (Figure 7).

Monetary aggregates expanded at a strong pace, reflecting the strength of the
balance of payments (MEFP, paragraph 6). Broad money grew at an annual rate of
11 percent in 2003, supported by a surge in the net foreign asset (NFA) that was mostly
channeled into Jordanian dinar deposits. Private sector credit growth continued to be low, as
banks remain cautious and demand for credit was met mainly through utilization of deposits

partly sterilized through an increase in bank deposits
at the CBJ overnight window facility and bank
holdings of CDs. As a result, reserve money grew by
an annual rate of 20.7 percent, reflecting the buildup
in commercial banks’ reserves and a large increase in
demand for currency related to cash-based trade with
Iraq.

The CBJ restructured one of the banks
under its temporary administration and strengthened corporate governance (MEFP,
paragraph 7). The restructuring involves the write-off of JD 30 million in the paid-in capital
of the bank, the injection of new capital by the original shareholders and the SSC, and a
change of the management and the board of the bank. On its part, the CBJ wrote off a JD 40
million interest free loan to the bank in exchange for the payment of the net present value of
the loan (JD 9 million) and provided additional interest-free liquidity support. The remaining
accumulated losses have been converted into restructuring costs that will be amortized over
10 years. In order to improve capitalization and corporate governance of commercial banks,
the CBJ issued regulations in August 2003 to double the minimum capital requirement for
banks to JD 40 million over the next four years and introduced a minimum leverage ratio of 6
percent. The CBJ also revamped its banking supervision in January 2004, including through a
prompt corrective action framework that stipulates automatic penalties for violations of
prudential regulations by banks. Jordan’s regulatory and supervisory framework generally
observes international standards and codes in banking, payments systems, securities, and
insurance, reflecting the efforts to strengthen supervision in recent years.
10.
Structural reforms are progressing as planned (MEFP, paragraph 8). The
government sold half of its holdings (26 percent of total shares) in the Arab Potash Company
(APC) along with transfer of management to a Canadian corporation for $124 million (net of
privatization-related spending) in mid-October 2003. A management contract for the
handling of the container terminal in the port of Aqaba was signed with a Dutch company in
March 2004. The government is also preparing the sale of majority stakes in the electricity
generation and distribution companies in the first half of 2004. In the meantime, a new gas
pipeline between Egypt and Jordan has been completed by the private sector on a build-ownoperate basis and is expected to be extended to Lebanon, Syria, and Turkey. The government
has embarked on a substantial improvement of the education system, with support from an
education sector reform loan from the World Bank.
11.
Progress was made in establishing a unified tax administration (MEFP,
paragraph 10). In line with Fund technical assistance recommendations, a unified revenue
department was established in December 2003, encompassing the Income Tax and the Sales
Tax Departments. The government appointed a director general in charge of the new
department in January 2004, and an integration project directorate was established in
February 2004.

III. ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION DISCUSSIONS
12.
Over the last few years, the performance of the Jordanian economy has been
robust. Real GDP growth has strengthened to about 5 percent in 2002, driven by strong
export growth, and the economy has shown strong resilience to the negative effects of the war
in Iraq in 2003. The external current account has registered large surpluses, leading to a near
doubling of gross usable reserves of the CBJ in the two years through 2003. Fiscal
consolidation has continued, albeit at an uneven pace, the GST base has been significantly
widened, and the external debt burden is expected to be reduced substantially over the
medium term. More importantly, the authorities’ steadfast approach to trade liberalization
and privatization, as well as a notable decline in red tape, have resulted in a conducive
environment for private activity that is increasingly recognized by foreign direct investors.
13.
Jordan’s medium-term outlook remains positive. Trade liberalization and
increased market access have set the stage for strong export-led growth over the mediumterm.3 Export growth is expected to continue at about 6–8 percent per year, spurred by the
FTA with the United States and the Association Agreement with the EU. Large private
sector-led infrastructure projects, including in water, gas, and electricity generation, are likely
to boost investment. Plan for Social and Economic Transformation (PSET)-related structural
reforms, enhancement of health and educational standards, and poverty alleviation are likely
to have a positive impact on growth over the long term. Overall, growth is expected to reach
6 percent over the medium term (Figure 9). At the same time, inflation is likely to remain
stable at about 2 percent per year. The external current account is expected to remain in
surplus, while gross usable reserves of the CBJ remain at a comfortable level of about 7–8
months of prospective import cover.
14.
The mission engaged the authorities in discussions on a set of broad economic
policy challenges for the medium term. The discussions focused on five main topics: (i)
progress in fiscal consolidation and debt reduction, relative to the targets envisaged in the
authorities’ fiscal strategy and the 2001 public debt law; (ii) tax policy and tax administration
reforms; (iii) potential vulnerabilities of the financial system identified by the recent FSAP
assessment; (iv) the sustainability of the gains made in the export sector; and (v) exchange
rate policy.

Jordan’s simple average tariff rate is 13 percent with a maximum tariff rate of 30 percent. Jordan’s overall
trade restrictiveness rating is 5, due to the exclusive licensing of petroleum products due to be eliminated by
2008 under the WTO agreement.

A. Progress in Fiscal Consolidation
15.
Progress in fiscal consolidation and debt reduction has been uneven in recent
years. The mission helped the authorities update their medium-term fiscal strategy, which
remains anchored to achieving the government debt ceilings mandated by the 2001 Public
Debt Law—namely that total and external government debt be reduced to less than 80 and
60 percent of GDP, respectively, by 2006.4 Over the last two years, the reduction of the ratio
of government debt to GDP fell substantially short of the authorities’ original plan, mainly as
a result of valuation adjustments associated with cross-country exchange rate movements,
lower privatization receipts, and lower-than-expected nominal GDP growth. The authorities
recognized the need to accelerate their debt-reduction efforts through a combination of
further fiscal adjustment, accelerated privatization, and prepayment of high-interest external
debt. A step in this direction was made through the prepayment of Par Brady Bonds, which is
expected to lower borrowing requirements by more than JD 10 million a year. The authorities
were encouraged to rebalance their debt profile, in favor of domestic debt, in line with their
new fiscal funding strategy and in consultation with the Paris Club (MEFP, paragraph 21).
The analysis of the medium term fiscal strategy in the accompanying selected issues paper
concludes that, notwithstanding the setbacks recorded in 2002 and 2003 mainly on account of
exchange related valuations losses, public debt remain sustainable as it is projected to
converge gradually to about 60 percent of GDP by 2010. Such a sustainable debt dynamics is
resilient to significant domestic and external shocks, except for large exchange rate
movements, which could significantly prolong the debt-reduction period, as witnessed in the
last two years.
16.
Fiscal adjustment is further complicated by rigidities in government spending.
About 70 percent of central government spending is nondiscretionary, partly associated with
priority sectors. Specifically, spending on education and health—at 5 percent and 4.2 percent
of GDP, respectively in 2002—are among the highest in the region and would benefit from
an improvement in the quality of spending rather than from an increase in outlays. Military
and security-related outlays account for another 8½ percent of GDP or 22 percent of total
spending, one of the highest levels by international and regional standards. The new
government is keen to rationalize and reduce government spending, but acknowledged that
this would take time and entail a difficult political consensus building process.

Chapter V of the selected issues paper provides full details of the authorities’ medium-term fiscal strategy.

- 17 -

B. Tax Policy and Tax Administration Reforms
17.
The achievement of the revised fiscal strategy depends crucially on further tax
efforts. On the one hand, the authorities have successfully implemented a comprehensive
general sales tax system since 1994, which now raises 8½ percent of GDP and has, over time,
offset the loss in trade-related taxes resulting from trade liberalization. On the other hand, the
income tax system remains mired in a complicated structure with widespread exemptions.
This has resulted in only a marginal increase in income tax collection in the last five years.
Despite strong political opposition, the authorities agreed to consider some reforms in this
area in the near future along the lines of Fund technical assistance recommendations.
18.
Improvements in tax administration could also yield significant results. In early
2004, the ministry of finance integrated the Income Tax and Sales Tax Departments into a
unified, function-based revenue department with procedures based on the principles of selfassessment and taxpayer segmentation (MEFP, paragraph 17). The new revenue department
will eventually have large- and medium-taxpayer offices to increase its effectiveness. In
addition, the use of single taxpayer identification numbers and the sharing of taxpayer
information across the different tax departments will reduce the scope for tax evasion. The
mission welcomed the authorities plan to move swiftly in establishing the new revenue
department so as to reap some of the benefits of integration, beginning with the 2005 budget.
C. Financial System Vulnerabilities
19.
The Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA) reports that the banking
system generally shows high capital ratios, liquidity, and profitability. However,
nonperforming loans are high, and there are four undercapitalized banks, after the
restructuring of one bank in January 2004, which account for 14 percent of banking system
assets (Box 1). One of these banks—accounting for 2 percent of banking assets—is under
temporary CBJ administration and is expected to be restructured in 2004, after criminal
proceedings have been completed. The restructuring of the bank may require use of public
funds in the range of JD 20–60 million (0.3–0.8 percent of GDP), depending on the extent of
the assets recovered during the criminal proceedings. The mission noted that the agreement in
January 2004 to restructure the bank under temporary CBJ administration could create a
moral hazard for future bank resolutions, because it returns the bank to its original
shareholders with a significant injection of public funds. The authorities were of the view that
there was no moral hazard because the restructuring involved a substantial loss of the paid-in
capital and injection of new capital by the original shareholders, the establishment of a new
management and board of the bank, and a modest use of public funds that is likely to be
recouped once the bank is fully viable again. They also pointed to the new prompt corrective
action framework adopted in January 2004 as a safeguard against any further use of public
funds. The authorities are working to restructure the four undercapitalized banks on the basis
of time-bound action plans.

(40 percent of GDP) in CDs, excess
reserves, and overnight deposits at the CBJ, which seems to have created incentives to fund
projects through equity financing, as private sector credit expansion remains low. The
authorities noted that the banks’ remained cautious in their lending approach, in view of the
difficult regional situation and the need to correct for bad credit decisions in the past.
Jordan’s regulatory and supervisory framework generally observes international standards
and codes in banking, payments systems, securities, and insurance, reflecting the efforts to
strengthen supervision during recent years.

D. Sustainability of Recent Gains in the Export Sector
21.
The export sector has been the main engine of growth for the Jordanian
economy over the last few years and is likely to remain so over the medium term. Both
the authorities and the business community pointed to the growing interest of investors in
Jordan as a gateway for duty- and quota-free exports to the EU and the United States, and,
more recently, as a hub for reconstruction and investment activities in Iraq. Despite recent
gains, the mission shared the authorities’ views that Jordan is far from realizing its export
potentials opened up by the QIZ initiative and FTA with the United States. So far, Jordanian
exporters have not recorded gains from the more liberal access to the EU market under the
Association Agreement, but with the recent depreciation of the dinar against the euro in real
effective terms, Jordan should be in a better position in the coming years. The authorities
underscored that tourism activity had reached a trough because of the war in Iraq and the
ongoing conflict in West Bank and Gaza, and there was only upside potential over the
medium-term, although the precise timing of the turnaround is still uncertain. They also
pointed to the growing role of Jordan as a training center for the regional computer industry
and for medical practices and tourism. They acknowledged, though, that domestic capacity
constraints (including at the Aqaba port), higher domestic transportation costs, and a lack of
skilled manpower could hinder the full growth potential in the external sector. In this regard,
the mission welcomed the government’s recent decision to privatize the Aqaba port
management operations and to increase its handling capacity in 2004.

- 19 -

Box 1. Findings of Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA)
Macroeconomic conditions have been conducive to financial stability, with external
developments potentially posing the greatest potential risk to financial stability. Jordan’s
financial system is dominated by the banking sector, which has provided a high level of
intermediation. Most banks are well capitalized, liquid, profitable, and can withstand considerable
shocks, but nonperforming loans are generally high, and there is high concentration in bank deposits
and loans. There are four undercapitalized banks, after the recapitalization of one bank in January
2004, with about 14 percent of banking assets. Problems in these banks were the result of a major
fraud case, weak corporate governance, and weaknesses in banking supervision, including the absence
of a framework for prompt corrective measures. The CBJ is working toward the restructuring of these
banks and has introduced a framework for prompt corrective measures. Banking supervision has been
strengthened, and most prudential standards are in line with international best practice. The FSAP
recommended that the CBJ monitor closely the problem banks, agree with them on time-bound
restructuring plans, and be ready with measures in the event of deviations from the agreed
restructuring plans. The FSAP also highlighted that the Jordanian banking system is vulnerable to
geopolitical shocks.
The FSAP also recommended the introduction of a margin between the interbank and CBJ
overnight deposit window rates. The interbank market has been repressed by excess liquidity and the
administration of the overnight deposit window, which has led to a convergence of the CBJ overnight
deposit window and certificate of deposit rates. Public debt and monetary management could benefit
from closer monetary-fiscal coordination. The securities market is going through an impressive
regulatory and technological improvement. Stock market capitalization is relatively high by
international standards, but the turnover ratio is comparable to those of illiquid markets; the bond
market is small. The securities market would benefit from privatization and from further financial
deepening, including a longer yield curve. Insurance penetration is low despite a large number of
companies. Its regulatory framework has been modernized recently. However, high initial capital
requirements, and the grandfathering of existing companies may discourage entry and market
innovation. Other priorities are to increase the independence of the Insurance Commission from
government, and to ensure that companies maintain adequate reserves.
The public pension funds are being reformed to cope with growing pension liabilities. The
government has taken measures to reduce expenditures in the military and civil service pension plans.
Although the SSC has a large operating surplus at present and has built up assets worth 24 percent of
GDP, its long-term financial position is being reassessed on the basis of an actuarial review. The
recommendations of the review are expected to be implemented in 2004.
Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME) have benefited from government and donor
schemes that channel funds at subsidized terms, but this strategy tends to inhibit the development
of sustainable intermediation in this market. SME credit facilities would benefit from wider access to
reliable credit information, reducing transaction costs in realizing collateral, and phasing out
subsidized lending. The payment system is modern and functioning relatively well. The expected
approval of the draft anti-money laundering law will strengthen the currently fragmented framework
and bring it in full compliance with international standards.

- 20 -

22.
The mission pointed to the downside risks that the elimination of textile and
apparel quotas in 2005 under the WTO ATC may induce foreign investors to relocate to
countries with cheaper labor costs. Based on scenarios prepared by the staff, the impact on
the balance of payments of the ATC could be in the range of $85–$340 million per year
(0.6–2.4 percent of 2008 GDP), depending on how much of the recent export growth in
textiles and apparel will be affected by the ATC. The authorities considered these scenarios
rather pessimistic and pointed to the establishment of 12 new foreign textile companies in the
QIZs in 2003 and continued strong interest of foreign investors in relocating to Jordan, as
indications that foreign investors still regard the duty exemption of QIZ exports as a sufficient
advantage to relocate their business to Jordan.
E. Exchange Rate Policy
23.
The mission reviewed with the authorities the appropriateness of current
exchange rate policy. The authorities noted that the current peg to the dollar had helped
Jordan bring down inflation to industrial country levels and that competitiveness was
adequate, as evidenced by the robust export performance in recent years and the mediumterm outlook for exports. They noted that the fixed exchange rate regime has served Jordan
well, including in view of recent Fund staff research documenting the prominence of nominal
shocks faced by Jordan in recent years. They also observed that the current peg to the U.S.
dollar was a natural nominal anchor, given that much of Jordan’s external current account
inflows were denominated in U.S. dollars or in currencies linked to the U.S. dollar.
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS RELATED TO THE PROGRAM FOR 2004
24.
Understandings were reached on the macroeconomic framework for 2004
(MEFP, paragraph 14). Real GDP growth is expected to reach 5 percent, supported by a
strong export performance and a strengthening of domestic demand. Inflation would continue
to be moderate. After allowing for a strong growth in non-oil imports, a modest rebound in
tourism activity, and a significant reduction in external grants, the external current account
surplus is expected to narrow to 5.3 percent of GDP. Gross usable reserves of the CBJ are
expected to remain broadly unchanged at $4.7 billion, equivalent to 9 months of prospective
import cover and 42 percent of JD broad money.
25.
The objective of the fiscal program for 2004 is to make sizable progress in the
reduction in public debt, consistent with the medium term fiscal strategy (MEFP,
paragraph 15). The authorities recognize that, although the targets under the Public Debt
Law of 80 percent of GDP by 2006 could still be attainable, this will require stronger fiscal
consolidation efforts. The 2004 budget, approved by parliament in February 2004, therefore
limits the overall budget deficit to 3.9 percent of GDP, which fully preserves the
overperformance recorded in 2003. The government expects to finance the additional
payments postponed from 2003 through higher grants beyond the budgeted level that are
under active consideration, but not yet fully secured. To ensure that the average deficit for
2003–04 would be less than the authorities’ original fiscal strategy, the program provides that

- 21 -

the 2004 deficit target may be increased to no more than 4.9 percent of GDP, in the event that
these additional grants do not materialize.
26.
The authorities will need to implement a sizable package of fiscal measures to
achieve the fiscal deficit target of 2004 (MEFP, paragraph 15). The attainment of the
fiscal deficit target (3.9 percent of GDP) is made more difficult by the loss of the Iraqi oil
grant; the expected decline in external grants, following the generous financial support of the
international community in 2003; and a significant upward revision in the World Economic
Outlook (WEO) petroleum price projection. Tax revenue is budgeted to increase by about
0.3 percent of GDP in 2004, compared to 2003 outturn. The expected revenue increase is
supported by a package of revenue measures (yielding 1.6 percent of GDP on an annualized
basis) and administrative reform. Grants are projected to decline by 3½ percent of GDP, after
the exceptional level of international support received in 2003, but would remain still high at
8.7 percent of GDP.
27.
The government revenue efforts will also be supplemented by spending cuts
(MEFP, paragraph 16) equivalent to 3 percent of GDP, thus reversing the fiscal stimulus of
2003. Current expenditure is programmed to decline by 3 percent of GDP compared to 2003,
including about 1.1 percent of GDP in cuts envisaged in the budget, that will reduce military
spending, purchases of goods and services, and transfers. Capital spending related to PSET
execution is budgeted to be about 2.1 percent of GDP, in line with the projected availability
of PSET grants. The implementation of the budget and the full utilization of privatization
proceeds for debt reduction purposes should enable the authorities to reduce net government
and government-guaranteed debt by 8½ percentage points of GDP to 93 percent of GDP by
end-2004, based on current exchange rate assumptions.
28.
Monetary policy will continue to support the fixed exchange rate peg (MEFP,
paragraph 18). Broad money is expected to grow at 8½ percent, in line with nominal GDP
growth. With a moderate increase in net foreign assets of the banking system, the projected
growth in broad money would allow for a significant rebound in credit to the private sector.
The authorities agreed with the staff’s assessment in November 2003 that the still fragile
recovery from the war in Iraq, weak credit demand, and the strength of the balance of
payments called for further monetary easing. As a result, the CBJ reduced its overnight
deposit rate by 25 basis points to 2 percent in December 2003. The mission shared the
authorities’ views that the large increase in reserve money in 2003 reflected a permanent shift
in the real demand for money and that the authorities’ partial sterilization was therefore
appropriate.
A. Structural Policies
29. The privatization program will be broadened and accelerated to promote
economic growth and help reduce the debt burden (MEFP, paragraph 22). The
government plans to privatize a majority of the electricity generation and distribution
companies in 2004. A portion of the government’s shares in the Jordan Phosphate and the

- 22 -

Jordan Telecommunications companies will be sold, as well as the remaining noncore
activities of Royal Jordanian Airlines. The government also intends to privatize, or put under
private management, the postal service and the Aqaba port. Overall, the privatization
program is expected to raise JD 300 million in 2004.
30. The pension reform has been completed (MEFP, paragraphs 9 and 23, and
Box 2). As planned, new military recruits have been shifted to the Social Security
Corporation (SSC) starting in June 2003, so as to reduce the burden on the budget over the
long run. In January 2004, parliament approved the tightening of military disability pensions.
The elimination of the so-called “four–year rule,” which provides military officers with a
pension of the next higher rank if they have served four or more years in their rank, was
approved by parliament in March 2004. The government is reviewing the draft actuarial
review of the SSC and, once the report is finalized in mid-2004, it plans to implement the
recommendations. The government is also committed to the gradual elimination of the
remaining price subsidies on petroleum products and the eventual liberalization of the sector,
once the exclusive concession for the oil refinery expires in 2008 (MEFP, paragraph 25).
31. Further progress has been achieved in the area of trade liberalization. In February
2004, Jordan, Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia formally reached an agreement towards the
creation of a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area by 2010. The authorities also concluded
negotiations with Singapore towards the creation of a free trade area and greater cooperation
for investment in high value added industries. While welcoming these developments, the
mission underscored the importance of further reductions in import tariff and non-tariff
barriers, including beyond Jordan's current commitments under the WTO to lower the
maximum tariff from 30 to 20 percent by 2010.
32. The safeguards assessment of the CBJ, which was completed on June 27, 2003,
concluded that there are currently no significant systemic vulnerabilities and that the
CBJ has made commendable progress in strengthening its safeguards, along the lines
recommended in the previous safeguards assessment of May 2001. However, the assessment
noted that there are still some unresolved issues at various levels of the bank’s operations,
including the need for greater transparency in the CBJ’s financial statements, and some minor
anomalies with data reporting. Consequently, the assessment proposed a series of measures to
address the identified weaknesses and, in response, the authorities have established internal
procedures for the CBJ’s internal audit to conduct monthly reviews of the monetary data used
for program purposes and have amended the contract for the external audit of the CBJ’s
financial accounts in compliance with the safeguards assessment recommendations (a
structural benchmark at end-2003 under the program).

- 23 -

Box 2. Jordan—Structural Conditionality
The current SBA continues to support the authorities’ structural reform agenda in order to improve
Jordan’s long-term growth prospects.
Coverage of structural conditionality in the 2004 programThe program envisages two structural
benchmarks: (i) the publication of balance of payments statistics by May 2004, in line with the
recommendations of the data ROSC, and (ii) the integration, by March 2004, of the Income and Sales
Tax Departments in a function-based revenue department and the establishment of a temporary
directorate to oversee the large- and medium-taxpayers offices.
Status of earlier (2002–03) structural conditionality Two structural performance criteria on the
enrolment of new military recruits in the SSC and the tightening of eligibility criteria for military
pensions have now been completed, albeit with a delay. The five structural benchmarks on: (i) the
development of a risk-based audit plan to audit GST taxpayers; (ii) the reduction of the ratio of GST
nonfilers to 10 percent of the total taxpayers; (iii) the implementation of a single treasury account at
the CBJ; (iv) the engagement of an externally recognized audit firm for the auditing of the 2003 CBJ
financial statements, with the provision of a review by an international partner; and (v) the
implementation of prompt corrective actions stipulating automatic penalties for violations of prudential
regulations by banks, have been completed.
Structural areas covered by World Bank lending and conditionalityThe World Bank has
supported Jordan’s economic reform and development efforts through a Public Sector Reform Loan of
$120 million approved in July 2002. The reforms address the quality and accessibility of public
services to households and businesses, and include ongoing reforms of the judicial system and the civil
service.
Other relevant structural measures not included in the current programThe government is
undertaking significant reforms in the power sector with assistance from the World Bank, but these
reforms are no longer subject to Fund conditionality. The government is also actively working with
bilateral donors in the reform of the water sector, improvements in health provision, alleviation of
poverty, and employment creation through training programs.

33. The authorities have made substantial progress toward subscribing to the Fund
Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) in the last two years, according to the
Update to the 2002 Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC)—Data
Module (Appendix III). The CBJ will shortly be in a position to publish revised balance of
payments statistics and the international reserves template according to the latest Fund
standards, supported by technical assistance from the Fund. A short-term fiscal expert will
also visit Amman in March 2004 to help the ministry of finance publish general government
statistics.

- 24 -

V. STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
Jordan has successfully weathered the disruptions caused by the war in Iraq
through domestic efforts and international financial support. Continued export growth in
markets outside the region, some easing of the monetary policy, and the fiscal stimulus
financed through external grants helped offset depressed domestic demand, leading to a
shorter and less accentuated slowdown in real GDP growth and a much stronger external
position. The authorities’ commitment to fiscal consolidation efforts, sound macroeconomic
management, and the support from the international community were reflected in a
remarkable degree of financial stability and a strengthening of private sector confidence, well
beyond earlier expectations. Nevertheless, the loss of tourism receipts and the export market
in Iraq, and a sharp drop in private investment, led to a virtual stagnation in per capita real
GDP and slowed down the pace of employment generation.
35.
Progress in fiscal consolidation and the timely implementation of strong fiscal
measures, despite the difficult political environment, helped achieve the program’s
overall fiscal deficit targets comfortably. The structural contents of the revenue package
and the reforms to strengthen tax administration have laid the foundation for sustaining the
pace of fiscal consolidation over the medium term. The authorities’ decision to accelerate
capital spending and compensate the economic sectors adversely affected by the war,
financed solely through increased external grants, was appropriate in the period immediately
after the war. However, the recovery in external demand called for a withdrawal of the
stimulus. In this context, the staff was particularly impressed by the new government’s
determination to achieve the fiscal deficit target by substantially tightening the stance of
fiscal policy in the last two months of 2003 and offset the expenditure overruns experienced
through October with cuts in other areas.
36.
The authorities’ program for 2004 is appropriate, reflecting the expected
recovery from the effect of the war in Iraq and the need to sustain fiscal consolidation
and structural reforms. The 2004 budget approved by parliament is consistent with the
medium-term fiscal strategy and contains another strong package of fiscal measures in
support of the deficit target. The staff, in particular, welcomes the decisions/commitments to:
(i) increase petroleum product prices, with a view to phase out remaining subsidies and
recoup the loss of Iraqi oil grants over the next 2–3 years; (ii) implement other revenue
measures entailing a broadening of the tax base and higher tax rates to achieve the fiscal
deficit target; and (iii) finance all programs under the 2004 PSET through external grants and
to use privatization proceeds entirely for debt-reduction purposes. To ensure the achievement
of the fiscal deficit target, the staff urges the authorities to implement expeditiously the
revenue measures and expenditure cuts underpinning the budget. The shortfalls in debt
reduction in recent years, although for reasons beyond the control of the authorities, have
eroded the cushion and exacerbated the risks for missing the targeted debt reduction,
envisaged under the Public Debt Law. A stronger fiscal adjustment effort is therefore needed
to offset the lost ground in debt reduction in recent years. Given the improved environment,
the pace of the privatization program should also be accelerated, and the composition of

- 25 -

public debt should be changed in favor of domestic debt through debt operations along the
lines of the authorities’ fiscal funding and debt-management strategy. Continued heavy
reliance on external grants, and the consequent increase in the fiscal deficit, excluding grants,
also poses a risk to the medium-term fiscal adjustment and debt-reduction paths.
37.
Based on the recent FSSA, Jordan’s macroeconomic conditions have been
conducive for financial stability and the banking system is generally sound in terms of
capital adequacy ratios, liquidity, and profitability. The problems with one small bank
under temporary CBJ administration and three other undercapitalized banks under
restructuring plans with the CBJ are, however, sources of discomfort. The staff urges the
authorities to deal with these problem banks promptly under time-bound restructuring plans
and to act decisively in the event of deviations from these plans. The authorities should also
avoid the perception of moral hazard associated with the recent bank restructuring by
forcefully implementing the recently adopted prompt corrective action framework and fully
reflecting the associated loan write off in the balance sheet of the CBJ in accordance with
international accounting standards. The convergence of the CBJ overnight deposit window
rate and other short-term (three- and six-month) interest rates, the very high level of shortterm deposits with the CBJ, and the low rate of credit expansion to the private sector point to
scope for further deepening of financial intermediation. In this regard, the staff welcomes the
recent cut in the overnight window rate. In the event the recent increase in the real demand
for money were to be reversed, the authorities should stand ready to use their liquidity
management tools to protect the net international reserve target.
38.
The current peg to the U.S. dollar has brought notable benefits to Jordan,
including price stability, a high level of confidence in the dinar, a transparent anchor for
monetary policy, and an added element of stability for investors and exporters. The empirical
evidence on the valuation of the dinar, indicators of competitiveness, and international
experience do not suggest an obvious need for changing Jordan’s exchange rate system.
39.
The program has certain downside risks. Continued regional instability could
reduce the prospects for economic growth and accentuate poverty and unemployment in 2004
and over the medium term. Enforcing the substantial expenditure cuts envisaged under the
2004 budget—following an expenditure-induced fiscal stimulus in 2003—will be a
challenging task. Slower growth, a delay in the privatization program, and a further
depreciation of the U.S. dollar, to which the Jordanian dinar is pegged, against other major
currencies could also delay the achievement of debt sustainability by several years.
40.
Notwithstanding these risks, the staff recommends approval by the Executive
Board of the authorities’ request for completion of the second review under the SBA, in
view of the solid track record on performance and policy implementation under the program
and the authorities’ continued commitment to prudent financial policies. The staff also
recommends approval of the request for a waiver of applicability of the March 31, 2004
performance criteria as the information needed to assess non-observance is unavailable and,
notwithstanding such unavailability, staff believes the program will be successfully

- 26 -

implemented and there is no clear evidence that the performance criteria will not be met.
Jordan is on track to exit from Fund financial support after the completion of the current
SBA, and the authorities’ intention to treat the remainder of the program as precautionary is
consistent with such an exit strategy. Jordan would continue with enhanced surveillance
under the Post-Program Monitoring, which is presumed to remain in effect through end-2005
when Jordan’s level of outstanding Fund resources would fall below 100 percent of its quota.
The timeliness, coverage, and quality of data are adequate and the authorities’ intention to
subscribe to the SDDS is commendable. The next Article IV consultation will be held in
accordance with the decision on consultation cycles for program countries.

accordance with International Standard on Auditing (ISA);
(ii) external audit opinion will be reviewed (so called “secondpartner-review”) by an international partner with International
Accounting Standards (IAS) banking experience from another
region of the international audit firm, who would issue an internal
report to the “signing-partner,” which attests the audit has met
international standards (the internal report would be made
available to the Board and Fund staff); and (iii) audit engagement
would be for a term that is greater than one year (e.g., three-to-five
years) (end-December 2003).

APPENDIX I

VII. Safeguard Assessment: Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the
Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) is subject to a full assessment with respect to the Stand-By
Arrangement, which was approved on July 3, 2002 and is scheduled to expire on July 2,
2004. The assessment was completed on June 27, 2003 and concluded that the CBJ has
made progress in strengthening its safeguards, as recommended in the previous
safeguards assessment of May 2001. However, the assessment noted that there are still
some unresolved issues at various levels of the bank's operations, including the need for
greater transparency in the CBJ's financial statements. Consequently, the assessment
proposed a set of measures, which once implemented, could further strengthen the CBJ's
operations. Implementation of the recommendations is being monitored by staff.
VIII. Exchange System: The Jordanian dinar is fully convertible and is officially
pegged to the SDR. In practice, the authorities have tightly linked its exchange rate to the
U.S. dollar since October 1995, at JD 1 = $1.41044.
IX. Article IV Consultation: The 2002 Article IV consultation was concluded by the
Executive Board on April 29, 2002. Two FSAP missions visited Jordan in August and
September 2003.

APPENDIX II

Jordan—World Bank Group Strategy and Operations
As of January 31, 2004, Jordan had received 63 World Bank (Bank) loans and 15 IDA credits
totaling US$2,177 million net of cancellations and terminations. Of the US$2,177, US$1,995
has been disbursed to-date. All the credits and 57 of the loans have been fully disbursed.
There are seven active projects in the Bank’s portfolio for a total of US$311.7 million.
Overall performance of the portfolio both from the perspective of implementation and
development impact is good. This reflects the generally good project implementation capacity
of Jordanian institutions, Jordan’s strong ownership of the program, and the quality of the
dialogue between the Bank and the Government of Jordan. The IFC has made cumulative
loan and equity investment approvals of US$262 million and about $78 million in
syndications.
The Joint World Bank-IFC Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for 2003–05, discussed by the
Executive Board in January 2003 addresses the same thematic challenges as the previous
CAS. Under the present CAS, the Bank will continue to provide support to the government’s
key objective, with focus on: (i) private sector development for sustainable growth and job
creation: (ii) human development with emphasis on poverty reduction and enabling more
Jordanians to participate in the knowledge economy; (iii) improving water resource
management and the environment; and (iv) greater gender inclusion in the development
process.
The proposed lending ranges from US$250 million in the base case to US$325 million in the
high case (compared to US$300 and US$450 million respectively in the last CAS). Bank
lending during the proposed CAS period will concentrate on the focus areas of human
resources development (largely education) and public sector reform, which together will
account for more than 80 percent of the proposed lending. Bank support for public sector
reform and education is a continuation of programmatic Bank support in both areas (Public
Sector Reform Loan series and Human Resources Development Sector Investment Loan)—
reflecting the need for a long-term engagement to address deep, underlying structural issues.
The CAS emphasizes knowledge sharing and capacity building through nonlending
assistance. Interventions that disseminate knowledge in the form of international best
practice, technical assistance, and economic and sector analysis will play a prominent role in
future Bank assistance. For sectors and areas where longer-term Bank engagement is
necessary but no lending is currently envisaged, the Bank will focus on a new multi-year
analytical and advisory activities that would enable the Bank to support sustained support for
policy reform, implementation and institutional development.
World Bank Group support to the private sector development will continue to focus on
improving the investment environment, privatization, partial risk guarantees for major
projects (envisaged to attract private sector participation and to provide a better financial
package for critical projects in water and energy), and, in the case of IFC, direct investment.

- 45 -

APPENDIX II

IFC has been active in Jordan for many years and has a current portfolio of US$109 million
in 17 companies. Its role is expected to expand as the investment environment continues to
improve and as new opportunities for export-oriented businesses open up in response to the
free trade agreement recently concluded with the United States and the association agreement
with the European Union. In addition to export-oriented sectors, IFC plans to focus on
investments in the financial sectors, infrastructure development, and information technology.

APPENDIX III

Jordan: Statistical Issues
The Fund mission that visited Amman during December 17–21, 2003 prepared an update of
the Data module of the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC), which
had been published on October 16, 2002. The mission found that important progress had been
made in strengthening the statistical system. Jordan is a participant in the General Data
Dissemination System and the metadata have been posted on the Dissemination Standards
Bulletin Board.
1.
As regards real sector data, progress has been made toward implementing the 1993
System of National Accounts, with the compilation of household final consumption
expenditures based on the 2002 Household Expenditure and Income Survey (HIES), and
supply and use tables. Also, statistics are being compiled and released on a more timely basis,
although GDP by expenditure is available at current prices only, and with a lag of more than
one year. The main actions taken by the Department of Statistics (DOS) in the area of
national accounts statistics, since the 2002 ROSC mission, include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Compilation of price indices for imports and exports for the compilation of GDP at
constant prices;
Estimation of household final consumption expenditure based on the 2002 HEIS;
Updating of supply and use tables for the assessment and valuation of the statistical
output;
Preparation of a study on the revision to the GDP series for 1976–2002;
Workshops conducted to enhance quality awareness of data providers and users and
to monitor users’ needs;
Adoption of a comprehensive training program for national accounts statistics
compilers; and
Dissemination of national accounts data at the two-digit level of ISIC activity.

While the CPI and PPI were considered of good quality by the 2002 Data ROSC mission,
DOS has short-term plans for improvements, including:
•
•
•

Incorporation of owner-occupied dwelling services in the CPI;
Updating of CPI weights based on the 2002 HIES; and
Dissemination of regional CPIs.

Recent improvements in government finance statistics have been facilitated by the
establishment of a statistical division in the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the adoption of
the Financial Management Reform Project (FMRP). The FMRP is guided by an
interministerial committee headed by the Secretary General of the MOF. Important actions
already taken include:

APPENDIX III

Compilation of data on the operations of the general government (currently, only data
on the budgetary central government are disseminated; the authorities plan to
disseminate data on the operations of the general government during 2004); and
Development of a migration path to the methodology of the Government Finance
Statistics 2001 (GFSM 2001).

Some of the actions contemplated in the comprehensive plan to improve the quality of
government finance statistics include:
•
•
•
•
•

Dissemination of data on central and general government operations based on the
classification and sectorization systems recommended by the GFSM 2001;
Seeking feedback from users of government finance statistics to monitor their needs;
Establishment of regular procedures for the verification of internal and intersectoral
consistency of government finance statistics;
Dissemination of a statement on the revision policy, an advance release calendar, and
more detailed metadata in the MOF publications and website; and
Updating of GDDS metadata on a more timely basis.

Monetary data for the CBJ and the commercial banks are reported and published on a
monthly basis, with the CBJ’s financial statements compiled on an accrual basis. At present,
consistency checks between government finance statistics and monetary statistics are not
conducted. However, the authorities are considering the establishment of an interagency
group to monitor the intersectoral consistency of macroeconomic statistics. Further, actions
are being taken to improve the quality of the source data and the methodological soundness
of the statistical output. In particular, the CBJ is:
•
•

Reviewing a new set of report forms for banking institutions, which the Banking
Supervision Department has prepared to facilitate better classification and
sectorization of the analytical accounts; and
Promoting the adoption of international accounting standards (IAS) by the
commercial banks. Also, the Administrative and Financial and Banking Supervision
Departments of the CBJ are in the process of adopting the IAS, in particular with
respect to valuation procedures and the recording of financial derivatives within the
balance sheet.

With Fund support, the CBJ plans to undertake the following actions to improve the balance
of payments (BOP) statistics within the next year:
•
•

Adoption of the BPM5 methodology in the compilation of the BOP statistics and the
international investment position (IIP), and dissemination of data in the BPM5 format;
Dissemination the complete Data Template on International Reserves and
International Liquidity;

APPENDIX III

Utilization of further data sources to increase coverage of international transactions of
the household and corporate sectors;
Resolution of most of the existing major gaps in data coverage, including gaps in the
financial account statistics and data on international services;
Development of techniques for systematically analyzing both raw data and statistical
aggregates to minimize processing errors;
Preparation of more comprehensive revision studies on a regular basis to strengthen
the statistical process;
Establishment of procedures for routinely assessing the quality of data, including
examination of the causes of estimation errors and revisions;
Dissemination of the provisions for the confidentiality of individual respondents’ data
and identification of the BOP Division as the source of the BOP data in the MSB;
Publication of more detailed BOP metadata and analysis of current developments in
the MSB and on the CBJ website;
Introduction of a regular and continuing program for consultations with users and
inform the users of the availability (on request) of more detailed data in the MSB and
on the CBJ website;
Publication of an advanced calendar for the release of BOP statistics in the MSB and
on the CBJ website; and
Updating of the BOP metadata on the GDDS bulletin board on a more timely basis.

March 16, 2004
Ms. Anne Krueger
Acting Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, DC 20431
U.S.A.
Dear Ms. Krueger,
1.
The Government of Jordan has held discussions with Fund staff in the context of the
second review of the program supported by the two-year Stand-By Arrangement (SBA)
approved in July 2002. Based on these discussions, the attached Memorandum on Economic
and Financial Policies (MEFP) reviews macroeconomic developments and implementation of
structural policies in 2003 and describes the government’s economic policies for 2004, cast in
the context of a revised medium-term macroeconomic framework. Jordan’s economic
performance under the 2003 program was strong, exceeding expectations in many areas, and
the policies for 2004 represent an appropriate response to the challenges emanating from the
conflict in Iraq and are consistent with sound medium-term objectives. Accordingly, we
hereby request completion of the second review under the SBA and a waiver of applicability
for end-March 2004 performance criteria.
2.
The Government of Jordan appreciates the financial and technical support provided
by the Fund and intends to continue its adjustment and reform efforts as envisaged under the
program supported by the SBA. In this regard, given Jordan’s markedly improved balance of
payments performance under the program and the substantial increase in its official foreign
exchange reserves (well above the level envisaged under the program), we intend to treat the
remainder of the SBA as precautionary.
3.
We believe that the policies set forth in the attached MEFP are adequate to achieve
the objectives of its program, but we will take any further measures that may become
appropriate for this purpose. Jordan will consult with the Fund on the adoption of these
measures, and in advance of revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP, in accordance
with the Fund’s policies on such consultation.
Very truly yours,
/s/
Mohammad Abu Hammour
Minister of Finance

JORDAN
Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies, 2003–04
1.
This memorandum reviews economic performance in 2003, updates the government’s
macroeconomic objectives in the context of a medium-term framework, and describes the
government’s economic policies for 2004.
I. DEVELOPMENTS UNDER THE 2003 PROGRAM
2.
The economy appears to be recovering from the disruptions caused by the war in Iraq.
Real GDP grew by 3.2 percent in 2003, after a sharp deceleration in the first half of the year
because of the decline in exports to Iraq and the negative effects of the conflict on tourism
and transportation. Growth in the second half of the year was mainly supported by a pick up
in domestic demand, associated with increased confidence after the war, the recovery in
bilateral trade with Iraq, and further growth of apparel exports from the Qualified Industrial
Zones (QIZs), mainly to the United States. Inflation remained subdued at an annual average
of 2.3 percent. The Amman Stock Exchange witnessed a boom after the war on expectations
of a quick economic recovery and grew by about 54 percent in 2003. Unemployment,
however, remains stubbornly high at 13.9 percent in part due to an increased participation
rate.
3.
All quantitative performance criteria on the fiscal deficit for end-June, endSeptember, and end-December 2003 were met by large margins. The overall fiscal balance
for end-December, as measured from the financing side under the program, registered a
deficit of JD 73 million (1.1 percent of GDP), compared to a deficit target of JD 175 million
under the program (2.5 percent of GDP). About two-thirds of this large overperformance
reflects a delay in settling certain payments to Iraq. Thus, the performance criterion for the
fiscal deficit at end-December 2003 would still have been met with a comfortable margin,
even if these payments were settled before the end of the year. Higher-than-programmed
grant receipts allowed the government to increase spending substantially in support of
domestic economic activity and at the same time reduce the fiscal deficit by almost 3 percent
of GDP over the preceding year on a commitment basis. Budget revenues fell short of
program projections, with higher tax revenues only partly offsetting a substantial shortfall in
nontax revenues. In particular, general sales tax (GST) collections increased strongly, boosted
by high import growth and improved revenue administration. In the last two months of 2003,
the new government successfully limited current spending below programmed levels, despite
significantly higher military spending reflecting the difficult security situation in the region
and some payments to compensate economic sectors affected by the war in Iraq. In particular,
the new Minister of Finance implemented spending cuts of JD 70 million committed but not
executed by the previous government and issued a special order stopping all expenditure
authorizations effected December 15, 2003.

- 52 -

4.
Notwithstanding the substantial reduction in the fiscal deficit, government and
government-guaranteed debt increased by about 1 percentage point to 101½ percent of GDP
at end-2003 as a result of valuation losses amounting to 6 percent of GDP associated with the
depreciation of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies. The level of outstanding public
sector debt, however, declined by 1 percentage point to 59.7 percent of GDP as a part of the
valuation loss at the central government level were recovered through improved financial
position of the CBJ and the continued generation of surplus by the Social Security
Corporation (SSC). In line with its new fiscal funding strategy aimed at rebalancing the
public debt portfolio in favor of domestic debt, the government also reduced external public
debt by about 6 percent of GDP through the pre-payment of Brady Bonds and debt swaps
transactions in December 2003, which will reduce external interest payments by $25 million
per year. The Ministry of Finance also issued five-year government bonds every quarter, the
cumulative sum amounting to JD 500 million through end-December 2003, with the proceeds
being used to prepay Jordan’s stock of Par Brady Bonds.
5.
The external current account registered a large surplus in 2003, reflecting a surge in
grant receipts and underlying strength in the balance of payments. Total exports grew by
8.2 percent in 2003, despite the disruption and cancellation of export orders during the war in
Iraq. Nontraditional exports fared particularly well, including textiles and apparel mainly
destined to the U.S. market which now account for almost 30 percent of total domestic
exports. Tourism receipts have started to recover due to an increase of visits from
neighboring countries as well as higher official and business travel related to the situation in
Iraq. Import growth rebounded strongly (10.8 percent), reflecting a pickup in domestic
demand, higher oil prices, and an increase in re-export activity to Iraq. With grant receipts of
more than $1.2 billion (13 percent of GDP), the external current account surplus in 2003 was
equivalent to 11.1 percent of GDP. Reflecting these positive developments, gross official
reserves increased by $1.2 billion to reach $4.7 billion at end-December 2003 (equivalent to
9.7 months of imports of goods and non factor services), notwithstanding the early
redemption of outstanding Brady Bonds ($456 million in face value) in late 2003, financed
by a drawdown of reserves of about $300 million. The real effective exchange rate
depreciated by 8.3 percent in 2003, implying an increase in competitiveness of Jordanian
exports.
6.
Reflecting the strength of the balance of payments and the resulting large net foreign
asset (NFA) inflows, monetary aggregates expanded at a healthy pace. Broad money grew by
an annual rate of 11 percent in 2003. Private sector credit growth continued to be low
(3.5 percent), as banks remain cautious due to the difficult regional situation. Lower interest
rates have not yet had the expected impact on private sector credit due to structural issues in
the economy. The large increase in NFA was only partly sterilized through an increase in
bank deposits at the CBJ overnight window facility and bank holdings of certificates of
deposit (CDs). As a result, reserve money grew at an annual rate of 20.7 percent. In
December 2003, the CBJ further reduced the interest rate on the overnight window facility to
2 percent in order to improve the short-term yield curve.

7.
The recent Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) missions reported that the
banking system generally shows high capital ratios, liquidity, and profitability. However,
poor governance affected negatively the asset quality of a few banks in the 1990s, resulting in
high nonperforming loans and undercapitalization in those banks. The CBJ acted strongly to
resolve this problem in the last two years, intervening in the case of two banks. An agreement
was reached to restructure one of these banks in January 2004, entailing a change of
management, the reconstitution of the bank’s Board of Directors, and a limited liquidity
support from the CBJ. In order to improve capitalization and corporate governance, the CBJ
issued a regulation in August 2003 requiring banks to double their minimum capital
requirements to JD 40 million over the next four years and introduced a minimum leverage
ratio of 6 percent effective immediately. Over the last few months, the CBJ has been
strengthening its bank supervision with a four pillar approach comprising: (i) a prompt
corrective action framework that stipulates automatic penalties for violations of prudential
regulations by banks, in line with the recommendations of the FSAP reports; (ii) a corporate
governance handbook that delineates the appropriate separation of ownership and
management in banks and sets standards for sound credit policies; (iii) an early warning
system that flags unsafe and unsound practices, and the deterioration of the financial position
of banks; and (iv) an electronic information sharing system with commercial banks. Jordan’s
regulatory and supervisory framework generally observes international standards and codes in
banking, payments systems, securities, and insurance, reflecting the efforts to strengthen
supervision in recent years.
8.
Structural reforms are progressing as planned. The government sold half (26 percent)
of its holdings in the Arab Potash Company (APC) to a Canadian corporation for
JD 88 million in October 2003 net of all privatization costs. The government also started
preparations for selling a majority stake in the electricity generation and distribution
companies in 2004. A new gas pipeline between Egypt and Jordan has been completed under
private sector initiative, which will be extended to Lebanon, Syria, and Turkey over the next
few years. The government has embarked on an initiative to modernize the education system
and improve its efficiency, under an education sector reform loan from the World Bank.
9.
The pension reform has been completed. In January 2004, parliament approved the
establishment of a medical committee in charge of approving military disability pensions,
which is comprised of three civilian doctors appointed by the Ministry of Health and two
military personnel. The maximum disability pension has also been capped at JD 500 per
month and the formula for calculating disability benefits has been made more stringent. The
so-called “four–year rule,” which provided military officers with a pension of the next higher
rank if they have served four or more years in their rank, has been eliminated.
10.
Progress was made in establishing a unified tax administration. In line with Fund
technical assistance recommendations, a unified revenue department was established in
December 2003, encompassing the Income Tax and the Sales Tax Departments. The
government appointed a director general in charge of the new department in January 2004.

The merging of the operations of the Income Tax and Sales Tax Departments is proceeding
with technical support from an Fund expert.
II. MEDIUM-TERM MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK
AND POLICIES FOR 2004
A. Medium-Term Framework
11.
The government’s central objective is to further raise living standards over the
medium term through accelerated, private sector-led growth. As outlined in the MEFPs of
June 2002 and June 2003, key elements of the medium-term strategy include a deepening of
structural reforms, public investment in human capital and economic infrastructure, and
continued implementation of sound macroeconomic policies, including further fiscal
consolidation. The program aims to increase Jordan’s real GDP growth rate to 6 percent per
year over the medium term with a view to enabling the economy to create sufficient jobs to
absorb the rapidly expanding labor force and reduce the unemployment rate from its current
level of 13.9 percent. Macroeconomic policies will preserve and consolidate monetary
stability and fiscal sustainability. Microeconomic policies, supported by the government’s
Plan for Social and Economic Transformation (PSET) under the National Social and
Economic Action Plan (2004–06), will seek to bolster both the magnitude and the efficiency
of private sector investment, through human resource development, improved public services
provision, rural development, accelerated privatization, and the implementation of fiscal,
administrative, regulatory, and judicial reforms. Because the PSET involves a large resource
commitment through at least 2005 and will entail sizable recurrent outlays over a much
longer period, the government is seeking multi-year grant financing from donors in order to
ensure the achievement of its medium-term objectives. The operational aspects of PSET
integration into the budget will be strengthened by merging the PSET in Chapter I of the
2005 budget along with other capital spending. The implementation of the PSET during the
last two years will also be reviewed, in collaboration with the World Bank, to assess the
quality of PSET spending and its impact on the economy.
12.
The medium-term macroeconomic framework envisages a strong recovery in
economic activity beginning in 2004, with real GDP growth accelerating to 6 percent per year
on a sustainable basis over the medium term; continued moderate inflation of about 2 percent
per year; a small surplus on average in the external current account; a secular decline in
public external debt as a proportion of GDP and exports; and the maintenance of official
international reserves equivalent to about eight months of prospective import cover. The
private sector investments that will accrue as a result of privatization and the accelerated
implementation of major projects will enhance prospects for growth.
13.
The macroeconomic framework will be underpinned by a medium-term fiscal strategy
aimed at sustained reductions in public debt and unfunded future pension liabilities. A sizable
further debt reduction will be crucial for improving the quality of government expenditure,
lowering real interest rates, and fostering investor confidence. Key elements of the fiscal

- 55 -

ATTACHMENT I
ATTACHMENT

strategy will include an acceleration of the privatization program; steps to broaden the GST
and income tax bases; the elimination of the cross subsidies on petroleum products to offset
the loss of Iraqi oil grants; and strengthening the long-term financial viability of the SSC.
Despite an assumed steady decline in annual grant inflows, the overall fiscal deficit,
including grants, is to be narrowed and stabilized at about 2½ percent of GDP by 2007.
Notwithstanding the recent setback due to valuation adjustments and lower-than-anticipated
GDP growth, the ratio of government and government-guaranteed debt to GDP is still
expected to fall by about 40 percentage points over the next six years, to about 65 percent by
end-2009. This strategy is consistent with the 2001 Public Debt Management Law, which
requires that the government reduce overall public debt to less than 80 percent of GDP by
end-2006, with external public debt not exceeding 60 percent of GDP.
B. Policies for 2004
14.
Economic policies for 2004 are designed to strengthen economic growth; maintain
financial stability and a solid external reserve position through prudent demand management
policy; and reduce further public indebtedness through continued fiscal consolidation. Real
GDP growth is projected to rebound to 5 percent, somewhat lower than Jordan’s full
potential, reflecting the still uncertain security situation in Iraq, and the continued tensions in
the West Bank and Gaza. Inflation is expected to increase somewhat because of upward
adjustments in administered prices and certain tax rates, but will still remain moderate at
about 3 percent. The balance of payments outlook is expected to remain strong despite the
expected drop in the exceptional flow of external grants associated with the war in Iraq. As a
result, the external current account is now expected to register a surplus of 5.3 percent of
GDP, and official external reserves are programmed to remain at a comfortable level of about
$4.7 billion by end-2004.
The 2004 fiscal program
15.
The 2004 budget, approved by parliament in February 2004, limits the overall budget
deficit to 3.9 percent of GDP. The authorities will make their utmost effort to achieve this
fiscal deficit target. However, additional payments that could not be settled in 2003 will
require additional spending in 2004 over and above the budgeted level of at least 1 percent of
GDP. We expect to cover these additional payments through higher grants beyond the
budgeted level that are under active consideration but not yet fully secured. In the event,
though, that these grants do not materialize, the budget deficit may need to be increased by up
to 1 percent of GDP. Tax revenue is budgeted to increase by about 0.3 percent of GDP in
2004 compared to 2003 outturn, with higher GST receipts more than offsetting the decline in
trade-related tax revenues brought about by the continuing liberalization of the trade regime.
The expected revenue increase is supported by a package of revenue measures (yielding
1.6 percent of GDP on an annualized basis) and administrative reform. The tax measures,
envisaged to be implemented shortly, include (with annualized revenue yields in parenthesis):
(i) an increase in the basic GST rate by 2 percentage points to 15 percent (0.6 percent of
GDP); (ii) an increase in excise taxes on alcohol and cigarettes (0.2 percent of GDP); and (iii)

- 56 -

ATTACHMENT I
ATTACHMENT

the doubling of taxes on mobile phone bill to 8 percent (0.1 percent of GDP). Nontax
revenues are budgeted to remain broadly unchanged in relation to GDP, supported by an
average increase in petroleum product prices of about 8 percent. Grants are projected to
decline by 3½ percent of GDP, after the exceptional level of international support received in
2003, but would remain still high at 8.7 percent of GDP, based on existing commitments.
16.
The government revenue efforts will also be supplemented by spending cuts
equivalent to 3 percent of GDP, thus reversing the fiscal stimulus of 2003. Current
expenditure is budgeted to decline by 2.1 percent of GDP compared to 2003, including about
1.1 percent of GDP in cuts envisaged in the budget. The areas where spending cuts would
take place include: purchases of goods and services, transfers, and other nonproductive
spending. Capital spending related to PSET execution is budgeted to be about 2.1 percent of
GDP, in line with the projected availability of PSET grants. The implementation of the
budget and the full utilization of privatization proceeds for debt-reduction purposes should
enable us to reduce net government and government-guaranteed debt by 8½ percentage points
of GDP to 93 percent of GDP by end-2004, based on current exchange rate assumptions.
17.
The fiscal measures outlined above will be complemented by further structural
reforms in the fiscal area. All government accounts have now been consolidated into a
Treasury Single Account as of December 1, 2003 that allows for a timely and transparent
monitoring of fiscal developments. The ministry of finance has also made significant
progress in merging the Income Tax and the Sales Tax Departments (Income Tax Department
(ITD) and Sales Tax Department (STD), respectively) to improve revenue collection. To this
end, it has developed a comprehensive strategy to establish a unified tax administration with
assistance from the Fund through the integration of the ITD and the STD. The proposed
strategy would create a single function-based tax department with procedures based on the
principles of self-assessment and taxpayer segmentation. The integration commenced in
December 2003 with the establishment of a unified revenue department, encompassing the
ITD and the STD under a single director general reporting to the Minister of Finance. In
addition, in February 2004, the government set up a temporary integration project directorate
with technical assistance from the Fund to oversee the development and implementation of
the large and the medium taxpayer offices; the reform of small taxpayer administration; and
the incremental establishment of an integrated head office. As the next step, by April 1, we
will finalize the criteria for taxpayers who will be subject to the Large Taxpayer Office
(LTO) administration.
Monetary and financial policy
18.
Monetary policy will continue to support price stability. The current peg to the
U.S. dollar has served Jordan well, bringing inflation down to industrial country levels and
fostering confidence in the Jordanian dinar. Strong export growth in 2001–02, the recent
sharp depreciation of the real effective exchange rate, and the rapid recovery in exports in the
aftermath of the war in Iraq, provide assurance that competitiveness is adequate. The CBJ
will continue to maintain a very comfortable international reserve position and stands ready

- 57 -

ATTACHMENT I
ATTACHMENT

to protect reserves and monetary stability through active liquidity management. The monetary
program for 2004 is consistent with the objective of continued price stability and also allows
for a substantial rebound in the rate of growth of bank credit to the domestic private sector.
Broad money is projected to expand by about 8.5 percent, broadly in line with nominal GDP.
The CBJ will limit the expansion of its net domestic assets so as to meet its international
reserve target in a non-inflationary manner.
19.
The government and the CBJ recognize the need to strengthen financial
intermediation. The government will continue to issue long-term bonds to provide a
benchmark for long-term lending by commercial banks. In addition, new laws were passed in
the last few years to provide the legal frameworks for establishing and operating leasing
companies, mutual funds, and credit rating agencies. Monetary conditions permitting, the
CBJ will continue to improve on the structure of interest rates by increasing the spread
between the overnight deposit rate and CD yields. This should revitalize the rather thin
interbank market. Stronger competition and better management practices in commercial
banks should also lead to a reduction in the spread between deposit and lending rates.
20.
The CBJ plans to restructure the small bank under its temporary administration with
new capital injection and with a new management and board, once the ongoing criminal
proceedings are completed. The restructuring of this bank would probably require use of
some public funds. In line with the prompt corrective action framework, the CBJ has reached
agreements with undercapitalized banks on time-bound restructuring plans, will monitor
closely these banks, and will be ready with corrective measures in the event of deviations
from the agreed restructuring. The CBJ will continue with the implementation of the
recommendations of the Fund safeguards assessment, which will further strengthen the
control framework in the central bank. In this regard, the audit of the CBJ financial
statements for 2003 will be done in accordance with international accounting standards and
will include a second partner review by a reputable international accounting firm.
Structural reform
21.
The government has embarked on a new fiscal funding strategy aimed at achieving a
more balanced distribution between the local currency- and foreign currency-denominated
components of the public debt. Sustained progress toward this goal would help absorb excess
liquidity, develop a longer yield curve that would also provide a benchmark for lending to the
domestic private sector, and reduce external indebtedness. The ministry of finance has been
issuing five-year government bonds on a quarterly basis since end-2002. The government
intends to continue with this strategy by developing a quarterly program for auctions of bonds
of various maturities, with gross issuance targeted at levels consistent with a deepening of the
domestic debt market. The authorities will explore the possibility of selling bonds to
households directly under a national savings scheme. The funds thus raised will be used to
reduce net external borrowings and, combined with the medium-term fiscal strategy outlined
above, will reduce both the vulnerability of the public debt burden to exchange rate
movements, and the level of excess liquidity in the domestic banking system.

- 58 -

22.
The government plans to accelerate and broaden the privatization program. As regards
the power sector, the government has created separate generation, transmission, and
distribution companies and has established an effective regulatory body for the industry. A
new electricity law has been passed paving the way for the privatization of the sector through
a new regulatory and tariff regime. With the completion of these steps, the stage has been set
for the privatization of the generation and distribution companies in 2004. The government
intends to sell a majority stake as well as management control in the Jordan Phosphate Mines
Company to strategic investors and possibly an additional portion of the government’s share
in the Jordan Telecommunications Company. It will continue to privatize the remaining
noncore units of the Royal Jordanian Airlines and will sell Jordan Post Company to a
strategic partner. The fiscal program for 2004 estimates total privatization proceeds of about
JD 300 million.
23.
The government remains fully committed to pension reform. It has already shifted
new military recruits to the SSC starting in January 2003, so as to reduce military pension
liabilities to the budget over the long run. Parliament also ratified the associated temporary
law in February 2004. The new tighter criteria for military disability pensions and the
elimination of the “four–year rule” were implemented in March 2004. The government is also
reviewing the draft actuarial review of the SSC and, once the report is finalized in 2004, it
plans to implement the recommendations.
24.
The government intends to improve the competitiveness of Jordanian exports by
increasing efficiency in the transport sector. In addition, the handling capacity at the Aqaba
port will be improved to avoid undue delays, following the increased activity of the port after
the war in Iraq. The management of container handling at the port has also been privatized to
improve efficiency and develop a medium-term strategic plan. The launch of the first
independent power producer (IPP) project in the energy sector, the Samra power plant, fell
through in November 2002 due to the difficult regional situation. The government has now
created a separate public company to implement the project. The new company will seek to
raise funds to implement the project mostly from the domestic banking sector without a
government guarantee.
25.
The loss of the Iraqi oil grant underlines the need to rationalize petroleum product
prices and liberalize the domestic market for petroleum products. The government intends to
eliminate the remaining subsidies on diesel, fuel oil, liquefied petroleum gas, and kerosene by
end-2006 and to reduce the vulnerability of the budget to world oil price fluctuations. The
government anticipates a multi-year transition period during which discretionary price
adjustments will gradually eliminate the existing gap between domestic and international
prices for the subsidized products. The price increases for energy products to be implemented
in the context of the 2004 budget constitute a major step in that direction. Once the gaps
between domestic and international prices have been closed, a symmetric automatic price
adjustment mechanism based on international prices will be introduced. However, the full
liberalization of the oil sector cannot be achieved until the exclusive concession rights of the
Jordan Petroleum Refinery Company expire in 2008.

The government and the CBJ are committed to meeting the Fund’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard within the next two to three years, and are implementing the
recommendations of the Update to the Report on the Observation of Standards and Codes—
Data Module in order to achieve this goal. In particular, the CBJ has already established a
new balance of payments compilation division and has allocated additional positions to the
new division. The CBJ also plans to start publishing its statistics according to the fifth edition
of the BPM5 and the international reserve template by May 2004. A strategy to compile the
international investment position in accordance with BPM5 will also be adopted by May
2004, with a view to commencing regular publication of these statistics within the following
12 months. To meet these targets, the CBJ is working with an Fund technical advisor on
balance of payments statistics. In addition, the ministry of finance has requested technical
assistance from the Fund to publish general government statistics by July 2004.
III. PROGRAM MONITORING
27.
Purchases under the SBA will be subject to observance of benchmarks and
performance criteria, completion of program reviews, and a continuous performance criterion
on the nonaccumulation of new external payment arrears. The third review of economic
developments under the program will be conducted in June 2004.
28.
Consistent with the discussion in Section II, quantitative performance criteria have
been established for end-March 2004 and indicative targets have been established for endJune, as specified in Table 1. The performance criteria will apply to changes in net
international reserves and net domestic assets of the CBJ; the overall fiscal deficit after
grants; the stock of government and government-guaranteed short-term external debt
(including that of the CBJ); and the contracting or guaranteeing of new nonconcessional
medium- and long-term external debt by the government and the CBJ. The quantitative
performance criteria are defined in the attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding.
Structural benchmarks are specified in Table 2. We will consult with Fund staff regarding
developments that may affect external financing and grants, and any significant deviation
from programmed levels will be a subject of program reviews.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
JORDAN
Technical Memorandum of Understanding
1.
Under the Stand-By Arrangement, the government of Jordan is committed to
implementing a financial program and a set of structural reforms. Progress in implementing
the financial program will be monitored on the basis of quantitative performance criteria and
indicative targets as set out in this memorandum, which is organized as follows: Section I
specifies the quantitative performance criteria, indicative targets, and applicable adjusters.
Section II specifies the content and frequency of the data to be provided for monitoring the
program. Section III provides definitions of the principal concepts and financial variables.
I. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA AND INDICATIVE TARGETS
2.
The quantitative performance criteria will consist of quarterly ceilings or floors on the
following variables: (i) cumulative change (from December 31, 2003) in the net international
reserves (NIR) of the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ); (ii) cumulative change (from
December 31, 2003) in the net domestic assets (NDA) of the CBJ; (iii) overall deficit after
grants of the central government (as defined in Section III); (iv) outstanding stock of
government and government-guaranteed short-term external debt with an initial maturity of
up to and including one year; and (v) the contracting (from January 1, 2004) of new
nonconcessional medium- and long-term government and government-guaranteed external
debt with an initial maturity of more than one year, with a subceiling on debt with an initial
maturity of up to and including five years. The floors and the ceilings applicable to the
preceding variables will be monitored on the basis of the magnitudes specified in Table 1 of
the MEFP.
Adjusters to the performance criteria
3.

The performance criteria specified above will be adjusted as follows:

•

The ceilings on the overall fiscal deficit after grants of the central government will be
adjusted upward by the extent to which expenditures associated with debt swaps5 with
official bilateral creditors exceed the amounts specified in Table 1 of the MEFP.

5

Debt swaps entail a reduction of bilateral debt stock in exchange for government spending on specific
development projects.

- 63 -

•

The ceilings on the overall fiscal deficit after grants of the central government will be
adjusted upward by the amount of the shortfall in grants received by the central
government compared to the programmed level as specified in Table 1 of the MEFP,
up to a maximum JD 75 million.

•

The ceilings on the overall fiscal deficit after grants of the central government will be
adjusted upward by the amount of recapitalization bonds at market interest rates
placed by the government with the troubled banks discussed in Section II of the
MEFP, up to a maximum amount of JD 100 million.

•

The floors on the net international reserves of the CBJ will be adjusted upward
(downward) by the extent to which the actual sum of foreign grants and net external
financing of the central government (excluding project-related loans and privatization
proceeds from abroad) received during 2004 exceeds (falls short of) the levels
specified in Table 1 of the MEFP.

•

The ceilings on the net domestic assets of the CBJ will be adjusted upward
(downward) by the extent to which the floors on the net international reserves of the
CBJ are adjusted downward (upward) due to shortfalls (excesses) in the sum of
foreign grants and net external financing of the central government (excluding
project-related loans and privatization proceeds from abroad) received during 2004,
compared to the levels specified in Table 1 of the MEFP.

•

The ceilings on the net domestic assets of the CBJ will be adjusted downward
(upward) by the extent to which the CBJ decreases (increases) reserve requirements
on Jordanian dinar deposits of the banking system. The adjustment will equal the
change in the required reserve ratio on Jordanian dinar deposits multiplied by the
stock of Jordanian dinar deposits subject to reserve requirements programmed for the
subsequent test dates. The stock of Jordanian dinar deposits subject to reserve
requirements are programmed to be JD 5,505 million at end-March 2004 and
JD 5,632 million at end-June 2004. During the program period, there will be no
changes in the regulations defining the deposits that are subject to reserve
requirements.
II. PROVISION OF INFORMATION TO FUND STAFF

III. DEFINITIONS OF THE PRINCIPAL CONCEPTS AND VARIABLES
6.
The net international reserves of the CBJ consist of foreign exchange (foreign
currency cash, deposits with foreign correspondents, and holdings of foreign securities,

- 65 -

ATTACHMENT I
ATTACHMENT

excluding any assets that are pledged or used as collateral), gold, the Fund reserve position,
and SDRs, less the foreign liabilities of the CBJ (including to the Fund), less commercial
banks’ foreign currency deposits with the CBJ, and less any change in the CBJ’s net foreign
currency swap and forward positions from December 31, 2003. In addition, deposits received
from foreign central banks or governments will be treated as liabilities in NIR, irrespective of
maturity. Alternatively, the net international reserve (NIR) is equivalent to the national
foreign asset (NFA) of the CBJ adjusted for outstanding purchases from the Fund and the
bilateral accounts (net).6 Gold will be valued at the average price of JD 219.78 per fine troy
ounce. The U.S. dollar value of foreign assets and liabilities will be converted into Jordanian
dinars at the exchange rate of JD 1 = US$1.4104.
7.
Reserve money is defined as the sum of: (i) currency in circulation (currency outside
banks and commercial banks’ cash in vaults); and (ii) nonremunerated deposits of the
commercial banks in Jordanian dinars.
8.
The net domestic assets of the CBJ are defined as reserve money less the sum of net
international reserves and bilateral accounts. They include: (i) net claims on the central
government; (ii) net claims on autonomous agencies with their own budgets; (iii) net claims
on the SSC; (iv) net claims on municipalities and local governments; (v) net claims on
nonfinancial public enterprises; (vi) gross claims on licensed commercial banks; (vii) claims
on other financial institutions net of deposits; and (viii) other items (net); less: (ix) JDdenominated central bank CDs; (x) remunerated deposits of the licensed commercial banks in
Jordanian dinars; and (xi) other remunerated deposits with the CBJ.
9.
The central government is defined as the budgetary central government that is
covered by the annual General Budgetary Law (GBL). It excludes the budgets of the
32 autonomous agencies, but includes all ministries and government departments, which
operate in the context of the central authority system of the state.
10.
Net external financing of the central government is defined as cash external debt
disbursements, less scheduled external debt repayments; less gross cash payments made in
relation to buybacks of debt and/or swaps of debt to official creditors net of: (i) accrued
interest paid; and (ii) market value of any collateral released, excluding accrued interest
receipts; plus exceptional external financing (rescheduled principal, interest, and accumulated
external arrears, if any). The debts covered are debts of the central government (excluding
off-budget military debts) and any foreign debts that are channeled through the central
6

The definition of NIR implies that, for program monitoring purposes, disbursements and/or purchases from the
Fund are to be recorded in the monetary accounts as external liabilities of the CBJ, rather than deposits of the
government. Furthermore, commercial banks’ foreign currency deposits with the CBJ are treated as foreign
liabilities in the calculation of NIR and NFA.

ATTACHMENT

government to finance operations of the rest of the public sector (excluding off-budget
onlending on loans that were contracted before January 1, 2002).
11.
Net bank financing of the central government is defined as the cumulative change
from December 31, 2003 in the banking system’s claims in Jordanian dinars and in foreign
currency on the central government (excluding holdings of Brady bonds), and net of the
balances on government accounts with the CBJ and the commercial banks (including
balances reflecting privatization receipts, but excluding deposits of UN compensation funds
relating to damages incurred in the context of the Gulf war). Foreign currency claims will be
converted into Jordanian dinars at the exchange rate of JD 1 = $1.4104.
12.
Net domestic nonbank financing of the central government is defined as central
government borrowing from, less repayments to, the nonbank sector (including the
nonfinancial public sector not covered by the general budget, and, specifically, the SSC), and
the cumulative change (from December 31, 2003) in the stocks of government securities held
by nonbanks and in the float. Float consists of the value of checks issued by the government
but not yet cashed by the beneficiaries.
13.
The overall deficit after grants of the central government is defined as the sum of:
(i) net external financing of the central government (including exceptional financing, i.e.,
rescheduled principal and interest payments); (ii) privatization receipts net of identified direct
costs of privatization transferred during the relevant period to the central government
accounts; (iii) net domestic bank financing of the central government; and (iv) net domestic
nonbank financing of the central government. Profit transfers from the Jordan Investment
Corporation (JIC) and small sales of JIC assets (not exceeding JD 5 million) will not be
included in privatization receipts.
14.
Government and government-guaranteed external debt covers all external debts
incurred or guaranteed by government. “Debt” has the meaning set forth in point No. 9 of the
Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt (Decision No. 12274–
(00/85), adopted August 24, 2000) and includes loans, bonds, suppliers’ credits, leases, and
other liabilities as further defined in the guidelines. Excluded are leases of real property by
Jordanian embassies or other foreign representations, and any other lease from a nonresident
for which the present value of all payments contracted during the period of the lease does not
exceed JD 1 million. For program purposes, “government” includes the central government
defined in paragraph 9 above, and government departments and official agencies which do
not seek profit and whose budgets are issued independent of the GBL. The external debt will
be expressed in U.S. dollar terms, with debts in currencies other than the U.S. dollar
converted into U.S. dollars at the market rates of the respective currencies prevailing on
December 31, 2003 as published in IFS.
15.
Government and government-guaranteed short-term debt covers external debt
defined in paragraph 14 above with an original maturity of up to and including one year, with

- 67 -

ATTACHMENT I
ATTACHMENT

the exception of normal import-related financing and instruments contracted after
December 31, 2003 with put dates that occur within one year of the original contracting date.
16.
The performance criterion on contracting or guaranteeing of nonconcessional
government and government-guaranteed external debt applies not only to debt as defined
in paragraph 14 above, but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed by government for
which value has not been received. The performance criterion covers the contracting or
guaranteeing by government or the CBJ of debt as defined in paragraph 14 above with an
original maturity of more than one year and a grant element of less than 35 percent, using
currency-specific discount rates based on the commercial interest rates (CIRRs) reported by
the OECD. Discount rates for assessing the conditionality of loans with a maturity of at least
15 years or more will be based on the average CIRRs over the last 10 years. The assessment
of conditionality for loans with maturities of less than 15 years will be based on the average
CIRRs of the preceding six-month period.7 Aircraft leases contracted by Royal Jordanian
Airlines are excluded.
17.
Any variable that is mentioned herein for the purpose of monitoring a performance
criterion and that is not explicitly defined, is defined in accordance with the Fund’s standard
statistical methodology, such as the GFS. For variables that are omitted from the Technical
Memorandum of Understanding but that are relevant for program targets, the Jordanian
authorities shall consult with the staff on the appropriate treatment based on the Fund’s
standard statistical methodology and program purposes.

Margins will be added to CIRRs as follows: 75 basis points for loans with maturity of less than 15 years; 100
basis points for loans with maturity of 15 years or more and less than 20 years; 115 basis points for loans with
maturity of 20 years or more and less than 30 years; and 125 basis points for loans with maturity of 30 years or
more.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
April 2, 2004
This statement updates the information provided to the Executive Board in the staff report
issued on March 17, 2004. The new information does not change the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
Recent economic developments point to continued strong macroeconomic performance.
Exports in the three months through January 2004 grew at an annual rate of 30 percent,
spurred by a near doubling of exports of clothing and apparel. Imports grew at an annual rate
of 18 percent during the same period. Revised estimates of the balance of payments for 2003
indicate a slightly higher current account surplus compared to the data presented in the staff
report. General sales tax (GST) and income tax collections were strong through February
2004, leading to a budgetary surplus—excluding spending through nonbudgetary accounts—
of JD 117 million (1½ percent of projected 2004 GDP). Broad money continued to expand at
a healthy pace through January 2004 (13.5 percent year-on-year), reflecting strong demand
for currency. Revised monetary data through end-2003 also show a somewhat higher
expansion of broad money (12.4 percent year-on-year) compared to 11.0 percent presented in
the staff report. The gross usable reserves of the CBJ declined by $237 million since end2003 and stood at $4.5 billion on March 25, 2004, reflecting the unfreezing of Iraqi
government accounts held in Jordan and the timing of disbursements of grants, as envisaged
under the program. The performance criterion on the net international reserves of the CBJ at
end-March 2004 is expected to have been observed by a comfortable margin.
The authorities continued to make progress on policy implementation and structural reforms.
Parliament approved the increase in the standard GST rate to 16 percent effective April 1,
one percentage point higher than envisaged in the authorities’ Memorandum on Economic
and Financial Policies. In addition, the cabinet approved the extension of the GST to alcohol
and tobacco, and an average increase of 9 percent in domestic petroleum product prices
effective April 3. These measures should yield additional revenue equivalent to 2.2 percent
of GDP on an annualized basis, which will help the authorities achieve the fiscal deficit
target under the program. Parliament also ratified the temporary laws passed in 2003 on the
taxation of interest income and the income withholding tax on importers. Finally, the cabinet
approved the planned privatization of the electricity generation and distribution companies,
which is expected to attract significant interest from investors.

Statement by A. Shakour Shaalan, Executive Director for Jordan
April 2, 2004
1.
The authorities would like to express their thanks to Management and the Executive
Board for their support to Jordan, and staff for their excellent work and helpful policy advice
over the course of this program. Given the strong balance of payments position, the
authorities intend to treat the remainder of the Stand-By Arrangement as precautionary.
2.
The Jordanian economy has once again proved its resiliency to external shocks,
thanks to its solid fundamentals and the swift response to mitigate the adverse impact of the
war on macroeconomic stability and growth. Prudent macroeconomic policies, supported by
the introduction of key structural reforms as well as generous aid from the international
community, helped Jordan withstand the repercussions of the disruption of trade with Iraq
during the war, the loss of the Iraqi oil grant, as well as the sharp decline in tourism and
foreign investment. Underpinned by the strong recovery in exports following the end of the
war, GDP growth remained healthy and exceeded population growth in 2003. Inflation was
low and the external current account improved appreciably, allowing the central bank to
accumulate sizeable foreign reserves. Performance under the program continued to be
strong, with Jordan meeting all performance criteria and structural benchmarks, and the fiscal
outturn outperformed the program target by a wide margin.
3.
The outlook for the Jordanian economy is promising. With the recovery of trade with
Iraq and the revival in tourism and investment, growth is expected to resume an upward trend
in 2004. Over the medium term, the wide-ranging structural reforms undertaken over almost
a decade and a half, and intensified in the past few years focusing on enhancing the
investment climate, laid a solid foundation for Jordan to move to a higher and steadier
growth trajectory. The authorities nonetheless realize that the reform agenda is still
unfinished, and are determined to continue the reform effort after graduating from Fundsupported programs, in order to remove the remaining impediments to higher growth and a
reduction in the still high unemployment. Their economic policy strategy for the period
ahead focuses on preserving macroeconomic stability and bolstering productivity and
competitiveness, including through improving infrastructure and human capital, further
enhancing the legal and regulatory framework, speeding up the privatization process, and
strengthening the financial system. A crucial component of this strategy is a fiscal
framework that aims at achieving further fiscal consolidation and improving the structure of
public finance, with a view to ensuring fiscal sustainability and a continuation of the
reduction in public debt.
4.
The fiscal overperformance, despite the difficult regional environment, attests to the
authorities’ commitment to fiscal consolidation. Expenditures during the last quarter were
sufficiently tightened to offset part of the expansion in security outlays early in the year,
compensation payments to sectors affected directly by the war, as well as capital expenditure
to help temper the impact of the war on growth. Additionally, significant efforts were made
in 2003 to lower the public debt and reduce its burden, including through the prepayment of
the Brady bonds, but valuation losses equivalent to 6 percent of GDP arising from the

-2depreciation of the dollar caused the level of the debt to edge up by 1 percentage point of
GDP.
5.
The 2004 budget contains important tax and expenditure measures consistent with the
targeted budget deficit of 3.9 percent of GDP. Higher GST receipts are expected to more
than offset trade liberalization-related revenue losses, and envisaged cuts in non-essential
spending will amount to 3 percent of GDP. Reform measures aimed at achieving these
targets have already been initiated. This week, Parliament approved an increase in the GST
rate from 13 to 16 percent, an extension of the GST to alcohol and tobacco, and a 9 percent
increase in petroleum product prices. The temporary tax laws passed in 2003 subjecting
interest income to tax and imposing an income withholding tax on imports have been
recently ratified by Parliament. The Ministry of Finance has unified the income tax and sales
tax departments, and work on establishing large and medium taxpayer offices to increase the
effectiveness of the new unified department is underway. In addition, expenditure control is
being further strengthened and a unified treasury account has been established.
6.
Over the medium term, reducing the public debt to comply with the limits specified in
the Public Debt Law by 2006 is a paramount objective of the fiscal strategy. The authorities
aim at further fiscal consolidation relying on durable fiscal measures, including through
further broadening the tax base and eliminating the remaining subsidies on petroleum
products. They will also continue to pursue an active public debt management strategy to
reduce its level and improve its dynamics, particularly by balancing its composition in favor
of local currency-denominated instruments. To reduce the public debt vulnerability to
fluctuations in the value of the dollar, the authorities are exploring means to hedge against
exchange rate fluctuations and are considering further diversification of foreign currency
reserves in line with the currency composition of the external public debt.
7.
Monetary policy has been geared to provide some stimulus to temper the slowdown
in growth, while maintaining price stability and confidence in the dinar. Inflation remained
low despite the impact of the depreciation of the dinar (which is effectively linked to the
dollar) on import prices, and foreign exchange reserves reached a record high. The
environment of tight fiscal stance and enhanced confidence, reflecting for the most part the
strong track record of the central bank, provided scope for a monetary policy easing to boost
domestic demand. The CBJ overnight window facility rate was reduced twice, bringing
about some reduction in lending rates in the banking system. Going forward, monetary
policy will continue to support price stability in the context of the fixed exchange rate
framework. The central bank will continue its effort to enhance the effectiveness of
monetary policy in line with the FSAP recommendation, including by further improving the
structure of interest rates on its instruments and addressing the structural problems impeding
flexibility of interest rates in the banking system. These efforts will benefit from the
envisaged quarterly program to auction bonds with different maturities, which will go a long
way in deepening the capital market and improving the yield curve.
8.
The effective peg of the dinar to the US dollar has served Jordan well. For almost a
decade since its adoption, Jordan has been able to maintain inflation at industrial country
levels. Confidence in the dinar has strengthened, and capital flight and pressures on foreign
currency reserves were virtually absent. Furthermore, Jordan’s past experience clearly

-3indicates that the economy is prone to shocks that are usually associated with short-lived
uncertainties, and that the fixed exchange rate proved useful in insulating the economy from
the adverse impact of these shocks. The authorities believe that a change in the exchange
rate policy at this stage is not warranted and could be seen as a sign of weakness given the
uncertainties arising from the current tense regional situation.
9.
The recent FSAP mission confirmed that the banking system in Jordan is generally
sound and well supervised. Most banks are profitable and well capitalized. This reflects the
central bank’s relentless effort over the past few years to strengthen the regulatory and
supervisory framework in line with best international standards. This effort has been stepped
up recently to address the remaining weaknesses identified by the FSAP mission. The
central bank issued regulations to double the minimum capital requirement by 2007 and
introduced a minimum leverage ratio of 6 percent. Measures have also been initiated to
improve corporate governance and financial disclosure, and bank supervision has been
significantly strengthened with the development of an early warning system and the adoption
of a prompt corrective action framework. Furthermore, competition has been enhanced by
licensing three foreign banks to operate in Jordan, which bodes well for the effort to reduce
interest rate spreads and enhance financial intermediation.
10.
The central bank was prompt in dealing with the few undercapitalized banks. One
bank has been restructured, including through new capital injection by the shareholders and a
strengthening of its management and board of directors, while the restructuring of the other
undercapitalized banks is underway according to the agreed time-bound restructuring plan.
In the meantime, the central bank is closely monitoring the financial positions of these banks
and their compliance with prudential regulations. The authorities do not believe that there is
any significant risk of moral hazard as a result of the restructuring process of the first bank,
especially since the amount of liquidity support provided to the bank was modest and the
original shareholders bore the largest share of restructuring burden. Furthermore, a prompt
corrective action framework has been adopted and the authorities have made clear their
determination to apply it strictly in order to avoid the use of public funds.
11.
On other structural reforms, important pension reforms aimed at reducing long-term
pressures on the budget have been undertaken. These included the tightening of military
disability benefits and the shifting of the new military recruits to the Social Security
Corporation (SSC). The authorities intend to strengthen the financial viability of the SSC
drawing on the findings of the actuarial review to be finalized this year. Furthermore,
significant strides were made in the privatization process, thereby supporting investment and
reducing inefficiencies as well helping reduce the public debt. The government sold half its
share in the Arab Potash Company, privatized the management of the container handling at
the port, and approved the planned privatization of the electricity generation and distribution
companies late this year. Plans are also in place to privatize other major public enterprises,
including selling an additional portion of the government’s share in the Jordan
Telecommunication Company and the majority stake in the Jordan Phosphate Company.
Proceeds from privatization will be used only for debt reduction operations while the Plan for
Social and Economic Transformation, which used to be financed partly from privatization
proceeds, will be financed exclusively from external grants.

IMF Executive Board Completes Second Review of Jordan's Stand-By Arrangement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed today the second
review of Jordan’s performance under a two-year SDR 85.28 million (about US$126.26 million)
Stand-By Arrangement. The arrangement, which was approved on July 3, 2002
(see Press Release No. 02/31), is being treated by the Jordanian authorities as precautionary and
is not intended to be drawn upon given the strength of Jordan’s external position.
In completing the review, the Executive Board approved a waiver of applicability of the
end-March 2004 performance criteria.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion on Jordan, Anne Krueger, Acting Managing
Director and Chair, issued the following statement:
“The Jordanian economy, supported by generous financial support from the international
community, showed strong resilience in 2003, despite the negative effects of the war in Iraq.
The authorities should be commended for their continued commitment to prudent
macroeconomic policies and far-reaching structural reforms, which has resulted in strong export
growth, low inflation, higher investment, and a surge in international reserves.
“The fiscal adjustment in 2003 is commendable, particularly as it came against the background
of strong capital- and security-related spending pressures following the war in Iraq. Going
forward, the authorities plan to sustain their fiscal adjustment efforts, accelerate privatization,
and utilize privatization proceeds solely for debt reduction purposes, so as to meet the debt
ceilings mandated for 2006 under the Public Debt Law.
“Substantial export growth, the stronger reserve position, and the positive balance of payments
outlook suggest that the Jordanian economy remains competitive, and that the fixed exchange
rate regime has served Jordan well.
“The banking sector in Jordan is basically sound, and the regulatory and supervisory framework
generally observes international standards and codes in banking, payments systems, securities,
and insurance. The authorities should effectively implement their new time-bound corrective
action framework to deal swiftly with the remaining few undercapitalized banks.

-2-

“The recently completed reforms of the military and the civil service pension systems were
essential steps toward fiscal consolidation over the medium and long term. The improved
economic outlook has enhanced the scope for accelerating the privatization program, and the
recently launched privatization of the electricity sector is a welcome step in that regard.
“The authorities have demonstrated a strong commitment to prudent financial policies and a
solid record of policy implementation. Given the strength of the external position, the
authorities’ intention not to make the purchase associated with the completion of this review is
appropriate, and consistent with their intention to graduate from a series of Fund-supported
programs following the completion of the current Stand-By Arrangement in July 2004,”
Ms. Krueger said.

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Jordan
On April 2, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Jordan.1
Background
Recent economic developments point to a recovery from the disruptions caused by the
war in Iraq. Real GDP growth slowed down to 3 percent in the first nine months of 2003,
due to the disruption of exports to Iraq and the negative effects of the conflict on tourism
and transportation. Economic growth picked up to 3.5 percent in the fourth quarter of
2003, supported by a significant jump in exports in the last two months of 2003.
The recovery is being supported by a boom in export growth from the Qualified
Industrial Zones, with exports to the United States growing by 56 percent over the last
12 months. A fiscal stimulus through higher public spending funded through grants also
contributed to the recovery in domestic demand. Inflation remains subdued. The Amman
Stock Exchange reached record highs in February 2004 on expectations of a positive
outlook for the medium term. Unemployment, however, remains stubbornly high at 13.9
percent as result of the rapid growth of the labor force, in part due to an increased
participation rate.
The fiscal deficit in 2003 was lower than the program limit, as spending overruns in the
areas of defense and security and accelerated capital spending were offset by higher
foreign grants. The overall deficit was JD 73 million (1.1 percent of period GDP),
compared to a deficit target of JD 175 million under the program. Budgetary revenues

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

were somewhat lower than programmed, with higher tax revenues partly offsetting
nontax revenue shortfalls. In particular, general sales tax collections increased strongly,
boosted by high import growth and improved revenue administration. Capital spending
was higher than programmed. Military spending and current transfers registered sizable
overruns, reflecting the difficult geopolitical situation in the region and the need to
compensate economic sectors adversely affected by the war in Iraq. Capital spending
was accelerated by 39 percent in comparison with the preceding year in order to
stimulate slack in the domestic demand in the aftermath of the Iraq war.
The external current account registered a large surplus in 2003, reflecting a surge in
grant receipts and the underlying strength of the balance of payments. Exports grew by
an annual rate of 8.2 percent, despite the disruption of exports to Iraq during the war.
Nontraditional exports fared particularly well, including textiles and apparel mainly to the
U.S. market. Re-export activity to Iraq rebounded strongly in the second half of the year.
The strong export performance was only partly offset by faster-than-anticipated import
growth (10.8 percent), reflecting a pickup in domestic demand and higher oil imports.
Tourism receipts recovered in the second half due to an increase of regional visitors and
official and business travels related to the situation in Iraq, while remittances grew by 4
percent. With grant receipts of almost US$1.3 billion (13 percent of GDP), the external
current account surplus for 2003 is estimated at 11.1 percent of GDP. Meanwhile, public
sector loan disbursements were lower than programmed and net private capital flows
registered a strong surplus of US$694 million. As a result, gross official reserves
increased by US$1.2 billion to reach US$4.7 billion, which is equivalent to about 10
months of prospective import cover. The real effective exchange rate depreciated by 8.3
percent in the 12 months to December 2003.
Monetary aggregates expanded at a strong pace, reflecting the strength of the balance
of payments. Broad money grew by an annual rate of 12.4 percent in 2003, supported
by a surge in the net foreign asset inflows, a large part of which was also channeled into
Jordanian dinar deposits. Private sector credit growth continued to be low, as banks
remain cautious and demand for credit was met mainly through a utilization of deposits.
The large increase in the net foreign assets was only partly sterilized through an
increase in bank deposits at the CBJ overnight window facility and bank holdings of
CDs. As a result, reserve money grew by an annual rate of 20.7 percent.
Structural reforms are progressing as planned. The government sold half of its holdings
(26 percent of total shares) in the Arab Potash Company along with transfer of
management to a Canadian corporation for US$124 million (net of privatization-related
spending) in mid-October 2003. A management contract for the handling of the
container terminal in the port of Aqaba was signed with a well-known port authority in
February 2004. The government is also preparing the sale of majority stakes in the
electricity generation and distribution companies in the first half of 2004. In the
meantime, a new gas pipeline between Egypt and Jordan has been completed by the
private sector on a build-own-operate basis and is expected to be extended to Lebanon,
Syria, and Turkey. The government has embarked on a substantial improvement of the
education system, with support from an education sector reform loan from the World
Bank.

-3-

Jordan’s medium-term outlook remains positive. Trade liberalization and increased
market access have set the stage for strong export-led growth over the medium-term.
Export growth is expected to continue at about 6–8 percent per year, spurred by the free
trade agreement with the United States and the Association Agreement with the
European Union. Large private sector-led infrastructure projects, including in water, gas,
and electricity generation, are likely to boost investment. Structural reforms,
enhancement of health and educational standards, and poverty alleviation are likely to
have a positive supply side impact on growth over the long term. Overall, growth is
expected to reach 6 percent over the medium term. At the same time, inflation is likely to
remain stable at about 2 percent per year. The external current account is expected to
remain in surplus, while gross usable reserves of the CBJ remain at a comfortable level
of about 7-8 months of prospective import cover.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the resilience of the Jordanian economy in 2003 in the
face of the disruption caused by the war in Iraq. Following the war, exports have
recovered and economic growth has picked up, the fiscal balance has improved,
inflation has remained subdued, and international reserves have strengthened.
The authorities’ prudent macroeconomic policies and their steadfast implementation of
structural measures aimed at transforming Jordan into a dynamic market economy—
together with significant support from the international community—have contributed to
these positive results. Directors welcomed the renewed commitment of the government
formed in October 2003 to macroeconomic stability and structural reforms.
Directors welcomed the strong fiscal adjustment undertaken by the authorities in order
to achieve the 2003 fiscal targets. They commended the timely implementation of the
package of fiscal measures, which included a significant increase in general sales tax
collection. Directors encouraged the authorities to continue with plans to adjust
petroleum product prices so as to eliminate remaining subsidies.
Directors underlined the importance of continued fiscal consolidation to achieve the
authorities’ medium-term debt reduction strategy and to meet the debt ceilings
mandated for 2006 under the Public Debt Law. The 2004 budget is an essential step in
this direction. In light of the expected decline in external grants, Directors encouraged
the authorities to sustain their fiscal adjustment efforts through further reforms of the tax
system and its administration, improved expenditure management, and an acceleration
of privatization. They welcomed the authorities’ intention to utilize privatization proceeds
solely for debt reduction purposes. They also welcomed the authorities’ new fiscal
funding strategy aimed at rebalancing the debt profile in favor of domestic debt.
This strategy will significantly reduce the vulnerability of the debt profile to exchange
rate movements while encouraging the deepening of the domestic financial system.
Directors noted that monetary policy will continue to support the authorities’ objective of
price stability. Most Directors emphasized that the fixed exchange rate peg to the U.S.
dollar continues to serve Jordan well and that competitiveness is adequate, as
evidenced by the strong export performance. Some Directors considered that the

-4-

authorities should continue building up the necessary institutional capacity to conduct an
independent monetary policy.
Directors welcomed the generally positive conclusions of the Financial Sector Stability
Assessment. They noted that, although the level of nonperforming loans is high, the
banking system is basically sound. Following its recent strengthening, the regulatory
and supervisory framework generally observes international standards and codes in
banking, payments systems, securities, and insurance. Directors urged the authorities to
deal swiftly with the few remaining undercapitalized banks on the basis of agreed
time-bound restructuring plans. Directors looked forward to the timely approval of the
anti-money laundering law.
Directors commended the authorities for progress in structural reforms, including trade
liberalization. They noted that the recently completed reforms of the military and the civil
service pension systems will strengthen fiscal consolidation over the medium and long
term. The integration of the sales and income tax departments into a unified revenue
department will also contribute by strengthening tax collections and enforcement.
Directors welcomed the sale of the Arab Potash Company and the recent launch of the
privatization of the electricity sector, which will help modernize the sector and attract
private sector investment.
Directors welcomed the substantial progress that the authorities have made in
strengthening the statistical system with a view to subscribing to the Fund’s Special
Data Dissemination Standard. They urged them to continue in their efforts to improve
the quality of their statistical databases, including in the areas of balance of payments
statistics and the international reserves template.
Public Information Notices (PINs) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the
conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMF to the
public. This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies of member
countries by increasing the transparency of the IMF's assessment of these policies; and (ii) following
policy discussions in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board.
