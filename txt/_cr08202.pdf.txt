EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Economic Setting
•

The civil unrest of the past two years interrupted Timor-Leste’s initial efforts to
develop a stable and healthy economy. The security and political situation remains
fragile.

•

Despite the domestic violence, growth rebounded in 2007, buoyed by higher public
spending. Inflation has risen sharply, but remains low relative to comparators. The
off-shore oil/gas sector has not been affected by the domestic crisis, and receipts
increased to more than triple the size of non-oil GDP in 2007.

•

The country remains among the least developed globally, and its outlook is
constrained by the security situation, poor budget execution (especially investment
spending), and a weak investment environment.

Key Policy Issues
•

The key challenge remains how to use growing oil/gas revenue to develop a
sustainable non-oil economy, while alleviating near-term social problems and
maintaining macroeconomic stability.

•

Stepped up public and private investment is needed, especially in infrastructure and
human capital. Fast-tracked updating of the national development plan is essential,
along with expedited structural reforms to spur private activity.

•

The authorities’ long-term fiscal sustainability strategy targeting inter-generational
equity through use of a petroleum fund, including identification of annual sustainable
spending limits, should be maintained. There is ample room under the fund’s
arrangements for needed spending to address social and development needs.

•

Steps to improve budget execution to enable targeted fiscal spending to rise to
sustainable levels are encouraged, keeping in mind administrative and absorptive
capacity constraints that could lead to inflation pressure and poor quality spending.

•

The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to use of the U.S. dollar as the official
currency, given its success in helping keep inflation in check and the lack of capacity
to manage monetary and exchange rate policy.

•

The government should focus on creating a supportive environment for a stable
financial system based on sound business practices to encourage financial deepening.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Timor-Leste’s initial efforts to develop a stable and healthy economy were
interrupted by the civil unrest of the past two years. Following independence in 2002, the
early adoption of prudent fiscal and monetary policies contributed to low inflation and
accelerating economic growth, while the onset of oil/gas revenue inflows brightened the
economic outlook. However, the domestic violence that first erupted in April 2006 brought
about economic contraction and diminished prospects.1 Although the economy has now
partially rebounded, non-oil GDP per capita remains below 2002 levels and the country is the
least developed in the region. Progress toward the country’s development objectives,
including the Millennium Development Goals, has been limited.2 That said, Timor-Leste’s
large petroleum wealth, if effectively harnessed, still offers the potential for a prosperous
future.
2.
The security situation remains fragile and an economic burden. The past two
years have seen persisting political tensions, several changes of government, and outbreaks
of violence between regional communities. Rebel attacks on the President and Prime
Minister in February dealt a fresh blow to the struggling nation. The President survived lifethreatening bullet wounds, rebels have surrendered, and disturbances have since diminished.
Still, upwards of 10 percent of the population remains internally displaced and widespread
poverty remains a source of instability. The continuing civil unrest has damaged investor
confidence, while the population’s still large development needs amidst growing petroleum
fund savings have put the authorities under considerable pressure to show results.
3.
The key challenge remains how to manage the abundant petroleum revenue to
alleviate near-term social problems and develop a sustainable non-oil economy. The
existing National Development Plan (NDP) focuses on steps to promote growth, including a
long-term oil-and-gas revenue saving policy supported by a petroleum fund; well-targeted
development spending under sector-investment programs; a monetary and exchange rate
regime that preserves macroeconomic stability; and a private-investment-friendly
environment. The government elected in mid-2007 has launched a discussion of national
priorities defining near-term goals for recovery, and plans to update the NDP later this year.
The current direction is toward greater emphasis on addressing short-term needs. Still limited
institutional capacity and a difficult starting point remain key constraints to progress.

II. THE ECONOMIC SETTING
Current Macroeconomic Conditions
4.
Growth rebounded in 2007, although
the civil unrest continues to undermine the
economy.3 Following negative growth in 2006,
the peak year for the civil unrest, non-oil growth
is estimated to have reached almost 8 percent in
2007 and should remain high in 2008. Growth is
driven mainly by the public sector, as government
expenditure surges and donor spending remains
high. Agricultural production contracted in 2007
due to drought and locust infestations. Output of
coffee, the main non-oil export commodity, fell
by an estimated 20 percent. Private sector
activity remains subdued by the security
situation.
5.
Inflation has risen sharply, but
remains low relative to regional comparators.
Consumer prices increased by 8.9 percent in
2007 and are likely to stay high in 2008, driven
by rising global food prices and reflecting food’s
60 percent weight in the CPI basket. Fuel prices
have also risen in line with international prices.
While government subsidies for rice have
partially shielded consumers, the threat of rice
shortages looms. Excluding food prices, inflation
was relatively low, although signs of increased
demand-side price pressures are emerging in tight
markets, e.g., in construction materials.

Revenue from off-shore oil/gas continues to surge, reflecting high international
prices. Petroleum revenue reached 340 percent of non-oil GDP in 2007, with petroleum fund
assets increasing to $2.6 billion at end-March 2008 (about 6 times non-oil GDP).

The large revenue inflows more than
offset a steep increase in government
expenditure, as external and fiscal
surpluses further widened. Central
government spending almost doubled in
FY2006/07, with a further increase in
spending during the second half of 2007, as
reflected in expanding non-oil deficits.4
Government expenditure drove a surge in
merchandise imports, which also almost
doubled to an estimated 51 percent of non-oil
GDP.

The increase in government expenditure has more than offset a gradual decline
in donor spending. On a “combined sources” basis, which includes donor spending for
projects identified in the national development plan, total public sector expenditure in
FY2008 is expected to reach 101 percent of non-oil GDP. Although the recent civil unrestrelated humanitarian needs have led to new commitments, international assistance is
expected to decline further over the coming years.

Notwithstanding the sharp increase, government spending to date remains far
below budgeted levels, especially for investment spending. Budget execution remains
constrained by weak planning and procurement capacity, as financial management reforms
have not yet had a significant impact. In addition, a large stock of unspent commitments
continues to be carried forward, despite efforts to tighten procedures.
11.
The planned 2008 mid-year budget update (MYBU) includes a significant
increase in current spending appropriations. Additional funds are being allocated for
public works programs, transfers to refugees, veterans and the elderly, and higher public
sector salaries. The MYBU also includes a large appropriation for rice purchases (5.8 percent
of GDP) to be used for subsidized resale to local retailers, distribution to civil servants, and
humanitarian assistance. The 2008 budget updated appropriations are expected to exceed the
estimated “sustainable” spending level defined under the Petroleum Fund arrangement
(Box 1), but actual cash expenditure is likely to be significantly lower.

Box 1. Oil/Gas Sector Policy
•

Under the Petroleum Fund Law, all oil/gas revenue is paid into the Petroleum
Fund and transfers from the Fund to the budget are subject to a spending
ceiling. The Fund is integrated into the central government budget with its
resources only spent through the budget following Parliamentary approval.

•

The “sustainable” spending ceiling is set to preserve the real value of the
petroleum wealth for future generations and to reduce the impact of volatile
oil/gas revenue. The annual “sustainable” spending ceiling is equal to the sum of
domestic non-oil revenue and the

•

All petroleum fund assets are invested abroad to minimize real exchange rate
appreciation pressures and protect the primacy of the budget. An Investment
Advisory Board recommends options for the investment strategy, which is
currently implemented by the Banking and Payments Authority. Plans are
underway to outsource part of the portfolio to the World Bank and BIS to gain
experience before approaching commercial managers. Plans are also in hand to
revise the Petroleum Fund Law to widen the allowable investment universe.

•

Transparency. Quarterly detailed data are published, along with an Annual Report
and the results of independent external audits of the monies received and the
sustainable income estimates. An independent Consultative Council advises
Parliament on Petroleum Fund issues.

13.
The civil unrest and mid-2007 general elections have delayed progress on
structural reforms needed to support non-oil private sector activity. A raft of critical
economic legislation is still pending. The court system is overwhelmed and there is no
effective system to enforce contractual rights or settle disputes. Business licensing
regulations appear to have become more complicated, rather than simplified as needed.
Outlook and risks
14.
The medium-term outlook is for moderate non-oil growth. The outlook is shaped
by, on the one hand, expected continued favorable oil/gas revenue prospects, and on the
other, constraints on the government’s
700
capacity to spend. Given current trends,

to 20-25 percent of non-oil GDP, and
slowly declining inflation. Staff estimates that a more appropriate and forceful shift in the
spending mix toward well-planned investment spending (bringing capital expenditure to
about 30 percent of non-oil GDP) and successful business environment reform would be
associated with annual growth rising to above 8 percent and less inflationary pressure than
under the baseline scenario.
15.

Key risks include:

•

Projections of oil/gas revenue and sustainable income are highly sensitive to global
oil market developments (Box 2). A disruption at Bayu-Undan, the one field currently
in production, would also have a negative impact on government finances. On the
upside, if realized, the Greater Sunrise project would almost double sustainable
income.

•

Continuing civil unrest and political uncertainty could distract from the pursuit of the
reform agenda, increase the need for short-term humanitarian assistance, and deter
private investment.

•

Higher global food prices and regional market disruptions could lead to shortages and
civil disturbances.

10

•

Failure to anchor government expenditure within a prioritized medium-term
development plan in line with administrative capacity could lead to waste, governance
risks, increased inflation, and little or no reduction in poverty.

•

Rapid assumption of large-scale external borrowing, particularly in the absence of a
prudent debt management strategy, could erode fiscal sustainability.
Box 2. Oil/Gas Sector Outlook
•

Every $20 change in global oil/gas prices changes estimated sustainable spending
by 10–15 percent of GDP annually.

•

Pending agreement on a development plan, the Greater Sunrise oil/gas field
(revenue potential of about $10 billion or 10–15 times 2007 non-oil GDP) could
commence production by 2015, possibly doubling sustainable spending over the
medium term.

•

A recent commercial discovery identified a significant new field, and additional
oil/gas fields offshore may be explored if oil/gas prices remain high.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
16.
The discussions focused on the new government’s plans for using the country’s
petroleum wealth to move onto a higher growth path, while addressing short-term
social and security needs and maintaining macroeconomic stability. As the past year saw
little progress on reforms due to the continuing domestic violence and midyear general
elections, the fundamental objective remains the need to overcome weak institutions and
infrastructure to better utilize available resources. At the same time, the civil unrest and
threatening food insecurity have created pressing challenges in the short term. The
discussions centered on four themes:

11

•

Building a strong and sustainable non-oil economy that would create employment and
reduce poverty;

•

Managing government spending to promote growth and address humanitarian needs
without risking macroeconomic stability;

•

Maintaining an appropriate exchange rate regime; and

•

Promoting financial deepening to encourage growth.

A. How to Accelerate Growth and Reduce Poverty?
Background and Staff Views
17.
Achieving Timor-Leste’s development objectives will be a long and challenging
task, requiring well-targeted investment spending and a supportive institutional
framework to encourage stronger private sector growth. The formal non-oil economy

12

needs to expand at a quick pace, at least 8 percent annually, to support the rapidly growing
population and prevent poverty from deepening.5 The private sector could be an important
source of long-term growth and job creation, with considerable potential in sectors such as
commercial agriculture (especially coffee), fisheries, and tourism, given under-utilized land
and untouched coastlines. However, the non-oil economy is unlikely to expand significantly
without greater public investment in infrastructure and human capital, and intensified
structural reforms to improve the competitiveness of the business environment. Timor-Leste
has weak infrastructure and shortcomings in education and health. In global surveys, it ranks
especially poorly in telecommunications and transport infrastructure, and in ease of contract
enforcement and property registration (Box 3). While the government has the financial
resources to increase needed investment spending, administrative capacity is weak and the
economy’s absorptive capacity is limited.

An updated and costed NDP should inform decisions on how to allocate TimorLeste’s resources, with projects prioritized according to the social rate of return, a
carefully sequenced timetable, and a framework for monitoring performance.
Completion of the NDP should be fast-tracked to support the 2009 budget.

Population growth is estimated at about 3.5 percent a year and youth unemployment in Dili at
40 percent. Almost 45 percent of the population is under 15 years of age.

Box 3. Exchange Rate Assessment
Competitiveness could be enhanced by addressing the significant structural disincentives to
private investment.
The exchange rate does not appear to be
out of line with fundamentals. The NEER
is close to its 2004 level. While the coreCPI-based REER has depreciated relative to
2003-05 level, headline-CPI-based REER
has remained relatively unchanged from
2006. Much of the REER decline can be
attributed to low core inflation relative to
Indonesia—the main trading partner—with
price pressures so far mainly resulting from
supply-side factors.
However, competitiveness and
institutional indicators give a more mixed
picture. Global surveys consistently rank
Timor-Leste as having one of the most
uncompetitive business environments.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that average
wages are relatively high, given TimorLeste’s low income and high unemployment.
However, private sector wages appear
relatively unchanged over the past several
years.

factors—the sharp increase in income and

implying space for the increased spending and consumption. While the current REER may be
undervalued, the degree may be small, given the high expected import content of future
domestic demand. As spending increases, the gap between the actual current account surplus
and the sustainable level is expected to narrow and then reverse. Sensitivity analysis indicates
that lower oil/gas revenues would further reduce the gap.

•

Structural reforms to increase productivity and spur private sector activity should be
expedited, in particular a pending land law to provide a framework for land
ownership, titling, and registration, and simplified business regulations, along with
judicial reform to help courts address commercial disputes.

•

The tax reform (Box 4), now being considered in Parliament, is a welcome step
forward. It also presents an opportunity to remove tax incentives under the investment
laws, which would be made redundant and have proved difficult to enforce.
Box 4. Tax Reform

Against the background of the significant increase in oil/gas revenue and reduced need for non-oil
taxation, the government plans to significantly reduce tax rates, lower compliance costs, and
streamline regulations to encourage private activity. The reform, designed with FAD and LEG
technical assistance, would maintain a basic system so that revenue could be raised in the future if
needed. It includes:1
•

Reducing income tax rates from 30 to 10 percent, with high thresholds that exempt most
wage earners and full expensing of fixed assets for businesses.

•

Reducing import duties and sales tax rates from 6 to 2½ percent and service tax rates from 12
to 5 percent.

As a result, non-oil tax revenue is estimated to decline from about 10 percent to 5 percent of non-oil
GDP.

Authorities’ Plans and Views
19.
The authorities agreed with the need for increased public investment, which was
the focus of their longer-term strategy. They pointed to plans to address shortcomings in
infrastructure and human capital, including wide-ranging investment in electricity generation,
road building, water supply, agriculture, ports, housing, health, and education. These sectors
would all be covered in an updated and fully-costed NDP to be prepared over the next few
months.
20.
The authorities also agreed that long-term growth and job creation would need
to come from the private sector. They are committed to creating an enabling environment,
including by passing the land law this year.

B. How Much Should the Government Spend to Promote Growth Without Risking
Stability?
Background and Staff Views
21.
The challenges presented by the civil unrest, combined with underlying
development needs, point to the need for increased spending; however large prospective
step-increases in the MYBU raise concerns regarding inflation and waste. Through
2007, combined government and donor expenditure have not had a major inflationary impact,

market. At the same time, in a
break from past policy, for the first time the authorities are considering external borrowing to
finance large-scale infrastructure development.
22.
While understanding the need to increase spending, increases should be better
prioritized and targeted to minimize waste and inflation. Staff recommended:
•

Tempering expectations and planned spending increases in line with implementation
capacity, while emphasizing investment in infrastructure and human capital consistent
with a prioritized NDP.

•

Closely monitoring price developments for signs of emerging supply constraints, with
mid-year budget reviews being an opportunity to manage excessive demand
pressures.

16

•

Targeting humanitarian relief to the most needy and minimizing disruptions of private
markets, designing an exit strategy to help avoid the creation of long-term
entitlements, and supporting domestic agricultural production.

•

Considering public sector pay increases together with performance-improving
reforms. The decision to delay a proposed new pay and grading system, pending
further study, was welcomed. However, a new13th month payment and continued rice
allowances to civil servants represent an effective pay increase of over 20 percent to
an already privileged group.

23.
Staff recommended addressing obstacles to budget execution, especially in
investment spending:
•

Budget execution would be enhanced by an updated NDP and medium-term fiscal
framework. Streamlining payment procedures and accelerating training and capacity
building would allow increased delegation of financial management and procurement
authority to line ministries.

•

Cash grants for specific purposes (e.g., education abroad or humanitarian aims) could
contribute to improved results, provided done without weakening fiduciary standards.

•

A move to a cash-based budget system that limits expenditure carry-overs to major
capital outlays and more comprehensive reporting on past budget execution would
enhance transparency.

24.

Staff viewed that the petroleum fund arrangements remain appropriate:

•

The petroleum fund helps promote macroeconomic stability by separating budget
spending from volatile revenue flows and emphasizing fiscal sustainability. By
mandating a high level of transparency and investing funds abroad, it also promotes
accountability. These mechanisms should help shield Timor-Leste from the natural
resource “curse.”

•

The existing framework is flexible enough to allow the government to spend more
than sustainable income in a given year, as long as the justification and consequences
are presented to parliament, helping ensure an open consultation process.

•

The current sustainable income levels leave ample room to meet immediate social,
security, and development needs.

Authorities’ Plans and Views
25.
Timor-Leste’s petroleum wealth has enabled the government to respond to needs
for higher spending. While medium-term development objectives call for increased
investment spending, the civil unrest and more recent food price increases require urgent
intervention. Immediate demands require higher spending and have skewed the budget

17

towards current expenditure. However, many new appropriations are one-off. Inflation risks
are manageable, especially given the large import content of government spending.
26.
The authorities stressed that the long-term focus remains on investment. An
updated national development plan would soon be ready, emphasizing human capital and
infrastructure. The authorities also reaffirmed their commitment to the basic principles of the
petroleum fund arrangement, although noting plans to broaden the investment universe to
increase returns.
27.
The authorities also underscored that reform efforts would soon improve budget
execution. Capital projects would rely to a large extent on international and private sector
expertise for design and implementation. They observed that their new government had been
in office less than one year and faced a starting point of very low administrative capacity. In
that light, the authorities noted their appreciation for assistance provided by development
partners, including the Fund and the World Bank for capacity building in planning and
financial management. In addition, several donors, including the AsDB, were devoting
significant technical assistance to infrastructure development.
28.
The pros and cons of external borrowing were being carefully weighed. Although
there is financial equivalence between foreign borrowing and drawing resources from the
petroleum fund, it could be more cost effective to use concessional loans. Additionally, if
technical assistance is attached, borrowing could also assist implementation of major
infrastructure projects. The authorities also noted that care would be given to avoid
unproductive investments and minimize inflation pressures, and that debt management
capacity would need to be created.
C. Is the Current Exchange Rate Regime and Level Appropriate?

Background and Staff Views
29.
Staff noted that the use of the U.S. dollar has supported macroeconomic stability
by providing a credible nominal anchor and helping keep inflation in check. In addition,
although institutional capacity at the Banking and Payments Authority (BPA) has been
considerably strengthened over the past several years, management of exchange rate and
monetary policy would strain existing capabilities. Staff also noted that the absence of
monetary policy tools places even greater importance on ensuring that fiscal pressures and
structural constraints do not undermine competitiveness.
30.
Overall, the exchange rate does not appear fundamentally out of line with its
long-term equilibrium (Box 3). While the REER has depreciated moderately, other
indicators of competitiveness are mixed. With the nominal effective exchange rate broadly
unchanged from 2004, the REER has depreciated mainly due to Timor-Leste’s record of
relatively low inflation, implying that price competitiveness has not worsened with the
growing petroleum revenue of the past few years. Indeed, a greater obstacle to
competitiveness and growth is likely to be the structural factors where Timor-Leste fares
poorly relative to comparators. Timor-Leste’s poor data quality precludes the standard

18

empirical assessment of the exchange rate level; however, a broad forward view suggests that
policies appear consistent with long-term external stability.
Authorities’ Plans and Views
31.
The authorities agreed that the existing exchange rate regime remains
appropriate. They concurred that stronger institutional capacity would need to be
established before planning the introduction of a national currency. They also reaffirmed
their intention to address the structural impediments to competitiveness and remain attentive
to emerging inflationary pressures.
D. How Best to Promote Financial Intermediation?
Background and Staff Views
32.
Economic growth prospects would benefit from a strengthened financial sector.
However, staff pointed out that the level of the credit to the private sector in Timor-Leste is
not exceptionally low relative to comparators 120

including:
•

Enacting critical long-pending financial sector legislation, including the law to
transform the BPA into a full-fledged central bank, as well as banking, payments
system, and anti-money laundering legislation.

•

Facilitating loan recovery and contract enforcement by finalizing land titling
legislation and procedures, and introducing alternative dispute mechanisms based on
traditional systems.

•

Continuing strengthening of banking supervision.

•

In light of well-known problems encountered by development banks globally,
ensuring that public sector involvement in the financial sector be on commercial
terms and supervised under domestic law.

Authorities’ Plans and Views
33.
The authorities agreed that the slow-down in credit growth since mid-2004 and
the increase in bank’s NPLs were concerns. They pointed to ongoing efforts to strengthen
the financial system, including a central credit information registry to be launched shortly
and continued enhancements in banking supervision. Banks were seen as reluctant to take
risks and charging excessive interest but, nevertheless, with a growing economy, the
authorities expected that credit would soon start to pick up.
34.
In addition, the authorities noted the need to expand access to financial services,
especially in the districts. To do so, the government plans to take over the largest microfinance bank and to create a National Development Bank, but plans for the latter were still at
an early stage. The authorities noted their determination to prevent political influence and to
ensure that loans are evaluated on commercial terms.
E. Other Issues
35.
Despite some progress, macroeconomic analysis continues to be hampered by the
absence of good quality data, particularly for the national accounts. Monetary aggregates
and financial data are now available in the IMF’s International Financial Statistics. Good
progress has also been made in compilation of balance of payments statistics, since its
transfer to the BPA, and the first estimates will soon be published. The staff recommended
that adequate resources be provided to compile the national accounts.
36.
Timor-Leste maintains an open trade regime, with a uniform duty on imports
and no quantitative restrictions.

20

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
Timor-Leste has a good foundation for economic development. Civil unrest has
caused setbacks and growth has not yet been sufficient to reduce widespread poverty.
Nevertheless, a sound fiscal and monetary framework has ensured macroeconomic stability
and the newfound petroleum wealth offers the potential of a substantial increase in living
standards.
38.
The strategy set out in the original National Development Plan remains valid.
This includes the long-term oil/gas revenue saving policy supported by the petroleum fund;
well-targeted development spending; a monetary and exchange rate regime that preserves
macroeconomic stability; and a supportive environment for private investment and activity.
The plan to update the NDP is an opportunity to reinforce these objectives and should be
fast-tracked.
39.
Greater efforts are needed to encourage private investment and activity. Staff is
encouraged by plans to enact a land law this year, the absence of which has been one of the
greatest impediments to progress. The planned tax reform is also a welcome step. However,
more could be done to simplify business regulations and to improve the judicial system.
40.
Stepping up investment will be key to growth and poverty reduction,
particularly for infrastructure and human capital. Financial resources are available but
achievable outcomes are constrained by low administrative capacity and a difficult starting
point, highlighting the need to prioritize.
41.
Addressing pressing security and humanitarian needs is necessary, but the
spending should be well-prioritized and carefully managed. Large increases in
government expenditure intensify the need to guard against unproductive spending and
inflationary pressures through careful planning and monitoring. The overall level of
appropriations should be in line with implementation and absorption capacities.
42.
Large spending increases planned for the mid-year 2008 budget, despite still low
administrative and absorptive capacity, raise concerns about potential waste and
pressure on prices. The increased spending appears beyond what can be soundly executed,
including the large ad-hoc wage increases. Care should also be given to avoid the creation of
long-term entitlements.
43.
Achieving good results depends on overcoming impediments to budget
execution, particularly for capital projects. International outsourcing would help speed up
implementation. Outcomes would be enhanced by more realistic planning, streamlining of
payment procedures, and a move to cash-based budgeting. Proposals to begin external
borrowing should be carefully weighed and transparently analyzed to ensure adequate
concessionality, a clear net positive rate of return, and consistency with the NDP and
macroeconomic stability.

21

44.
The petroleum fund is a cornerstone for sound management of the country’s
resources. The fund provides a powerful tool for promoting fiscal sustainability and
macroeconomic stability. By smoothing budget spending, investing the remainder abroad,
and mandating a high level of transparency, it shields against the “oil curse” afflicting other
resource rich countries. The focus on sustainable income encourages prioritization. The
model is also flexible and allows for higher levels of spending, if justified. When revisiting
the petroleum fund law to enhance the expected rate of return, the authorities are urged to
preserve the basic principles of this framework.
45.
The current level of the exchange rate appears broadly consistent with its
equilibrium level. The use of the U.S. dollar has served the economy well by providing a
credible nominal anchor for price stability, although it places greater emphasis on ensuring
that fiscal pressures do not undermine macroeconomic stability. Stronger institutional
capacity is needed before considering a move to introduce a national currency.
46.
Initiatives to strengthen the financial sector are welcomed, including progress on a
credit registry and strengthening banking supervision. Additional efforts are needed on
pending financial sector legislation and creation of an alternative dispute mechanism, while
any government participation in the financial system should be on commercial terms and
supervised under domestic banking laws.
47.
Progress on compilation of financial and balance of payments statistics is
welcome, but better monitoring of real sector activity is needed. Creating capacity to
compile national accounts should be a priority.
48.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be conducted on the standard
12-month cycle.

1/ Includes locally paid compensation of UN peacekeeping mission staff.
2/ Whole of the country CPI from 2003.
3/ Excludes oil/gas sector investment.
4/ Fiscal years (July-June) up to FY2006/07 (in column for 2006); Fiscal year corresponds to calendar years from 2008.
5/ Includes autonomous agencies and quasi-fiscal expenditure programs undertaken by bilaterals and multilaterals outside the central government budget. The revenue
decline in 2005 reflects the creation of the petroleum fund, to which oil revenue now accrues. Income from the fund and donor grants finance the fiscal deficit.
6/ Excludes currency holdings by the public, for which no data are available.
7/ Excludes oil/gas revenue, which is recorded as income, and re-exports, which primarily relate to repatriation of UN peacekeeping equipment.

1/ Fiscal year: July-June until 2008, then calendar year. Central Government includes subsidies to Autonomous Agencies.
2/ Oil revenue projections are based on current budget assumptions for price and production.
3/ Staff projections are based on past ratios of actual commitments and cash disbursements to budgeted allocations.
4/ Includes allocations for BPA capitalization ($10.5 million in 2005/06).
5/ Cash expenditure includes carry-over expenditure from previous years (the reporting of which is not disaggregated).
The carry-over is reportedly largely capital expenditure, as most recurrent expenditure is executed in the budgeted year.
6/ Permanent income from oil (estimated in line with the Petroleum Fund law) and projected domestic revenue and grants.
7/ Preliminary mid-year budget update, as of mid-May, 2007.

deficit is withdrawn from the fund transferred to the budget up to the estimated sustainable income level and recorded as a financing item.
2/ Includes sector projects which the government has identified as necessary to achieve NDP objectives, but may not be wholly funded.
3/ Oil/gas revenue is included in the line of oil fund financing.
4/ New projects financing requested from donors; still uncommitted.

On January 24, 2000, the U.S. dollar was adopted as the official currency of then
East Timor by the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor
(UNTAET). This arrangement has been maintained after Timor-Leste’s
independence on May 20, 2002. At present, the monetary authority does not
undertake foreign exchange transactions; they are handled by commercial banks
on the basis of rates quoted in the international markets.
VIII. Article IV Consultations
The 2006 Article IV consultation discussions with the authorities were held
during October 9–20, 2006. The last Article IV consultation was concluded on
January 29, 2007. The Public Information Note may be found at
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2007/pn0724.htm.
IX.

Technical Assistance
Since late 1999, a significant amount of technical assistance has been
provided by the Fund as part of the international community’s efforts to
reconstruct the Timor-Leste economy. The Fund’s technical assistance has

3
focused on establishing key economic institutions (especially fiscal and
monetary authorities) essential for macroeconomic management, as well
as on developing local capacity to manage them. It also played a key role
in the adoption of a new currency arrangement based on the U.S. dollar.
Between late 1999 and end–2007, Timor-Leste has been one of the largest
recipients of Fund technical assistance.
FAD: A series of multi-topic FAD missions took place early on to establish and
develop the Central Fiscal Authority (CFA, February 2000), which developed into
the Ministry of Planning and Finance. Assistance was provided to develop budget
preparation, establish tax policy and administration, strengthen treasury and
expenditure management, and advise on oil sector fiscal regimes. Long-term
resident advisors were assigned to the Ministry of Planning and Finance and the
Revenue Service of Timor-Leste to cover a wide range of issues, partly under a
cost sharing arrangement with the UN. Over August 2004–July 2005, a FAD
resident advisor assisted in the design and establishment of the Petroleum Fund,
which started operations in August 2005. A FAD resident advisor to the Treasurer
of the ministry finance started work in December 2006 to help strengthen
expenditure management, reporting and budget execution—after a short break, a
replacement will commence in June 2008 to continue this work. In 2007, an FAD
TA mission provided guidance for future reform of the non-oil tax regime.
LEG: A number of LEG missions have been to Timor Leste to advise the
authorities on key fiscal and financial legislation. These included tax legislation,
the budget and financial management law, and banking regulations (relating to the
monetary authority, the banking system, and the payments system). Jointly with
MFD (now MCM), technical assistance has been provided to assist in drafting an
AML/CFT Law. LEG has also recently provided assistance, in collaboration with
FAD, for the drafting of the Petroleum Fund Act and tax consolidation, and in
collaboration with MCM, for the drafting of the Central Bank Law.
MCM: A large number of missions took place early on to establish and develop
the Central Payments Office (CPO, January 2000), which was transformed
subsequently into the Banking and Payments Authority (BPA) (November 2001).
Assistance was provided to establish a payment system, prepare banking
legislation, and develop key functions of the monetary authority, including
banking supervision, asset management, accounting, and organization and
management. Assistance was also provided on the introduction of a dollar-based
currency system and to issue domestic coins to supplement the use of U.S. dollar
coins. More recently, assistance has been provided to (i) draft the insurance law
and develop a framework for insurance supervision, (ii) strengthen banking
supervision, (iii) address a broad range of issues relating to money laundering and

4
financing of terrorism, (iv) establish and train the investment unit responsible for
managing petroleum fund assets (funded by Norway, a resident adviser
commenced in March 2005 and, after a break due to contract renegotiations, a
replacement is expected to commence in 2008), (v) prepare for the establishment
of the central bank, (vi) design of a more effective organizational structure at the
BPA, and (vii) modernize payment systems, and accounting for the Petroleum
Fund. In addition, long-term resident advisors, including on banking supervision,
payments, and accounting, have been assigned to the BPA under a cost sharing
arrangement with the UN. Since early 2005, a long-term advisor has been
assisting the BPA general manager.
STA: A multi-sector statistical mission took place in November 2000 to assess
the availability and quality of official macroeconomic data, and help establish the
Statistic Division of the Ministry of Planning and Finance. A long term statistical
advisors was provided over the period November 2001-October 2005. A
peripatetic statistical advisor was appointed in 2007 and is assisting the authorities
in improving data compilation and developing local capacity to prepare balance of
payments statistics—responsibility for this was transferred to the BPA in 2007. In
early 2008 a monetary and financial statistics mission helped introduce the
standardized report forms (SRFs) for reporting monetary data to the IMF and an
integrated monetary database. Subsequently, Timor-Leste has, for the first time,
been able to publish a country page in IFS.

Resident Representative
A resident representative office was established in Dili in August 2000. The
current resident representative, Mr. Tobias Rasmussen assumed the post in
February 2006.

5
ANNEX II. TIMOR-LESTE: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of May 6, 2008)
1.
Timor-Leste joined the World Bank Group on July 23, 2002. It became eligible for
IDA assistance on October 9, 2002. Thus far, there has been no lending to Timor-Leste,
reflecting the authorities’ policy to avoid external borrowing, including concessional loans.
However, the World Bank has been actively involved in the reconstruction and development
of the economy since late 1999, by playing a key catalytic role in mobilizing and
coordinating international assistance to Timor-Leste. Timor-Leste also joined IFC in
September 2004 and, together with the Pacific Enterprise Development Facility, an office
was opened in Dili in 2006.
During the transition to independence, the World Bank’s involvement centered
around its role as trustee and co-manager of the Trust Fund for East Timor (TFET), which
was established in December 1999 as a vehicle to provide grant assistance for reconstruction
activities and economic development in Timor-Leste. Under the TFET, which is co-managed
with the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the World Bank has administered projects relating
to social services (especially health and education), agriculture, private sector development,
community development and governance, economic capacity building, and petroleum sector
development.1
2.

3.
In addition to its involvement through the TFET, the World Bank played a key role in
mobilizing budgetary assistance for the post-independence period through an annual multidonor budget support operation. The Transition Support Program (TSP) from FY 2003 to
2005, was followed by the Consolidation Support Program (CSP) to FY2006/07, to reflect
the shift from post-conflict transition to consolidation of gains made thus far. The TSP
programs brought about $30 million in budget support annually with about $5 million
financed by IDA, and the balance financed by 9 bilateral partners. The CSP programs
brought around $10 million in budget support annually, with about $0.5 million financed by
IDA. Both the TSP and the CSP programs focused on three thematic areas: (1) good
governance, including developing a legal framework for governance and the judiciary and
strengthening public expenditure management; (2) service delivery for poverty reduction,
particularly in education and health; and (3) job creation, especially through private sector
development, agriculture, and improvements in basic infrastructure.
4.
The World Bank has also provided analytical and advisory services, including
through a Country Economic Memorandum, a Poverty Assessment, a Public Expenditure
Management and Accountability Note, a Public Expenditure Review, an Education Sector
Review, and a Paper on Strengthening the Institutions of Governance in Timor-Leste. The
1

Pledges to the TFET were made by 12 donors, including the European Commission and the World Bank, with
the total amount of funds reaching $178 million. This comprises donors’ contributions of $167 million
(including $10 million by the World Bank) and investment income of $9 million. Of this total, $167 million was
disbursed by end-February 2008 (a new Trustee Report is now under preparation and should be released before
end-May). TFET projects are expected to wind down by end-2010.

6
“Doing Business” report for 2006 featured Timor-Leste for the first time and was updated for
2007.
5.
In July 2005 the World Bank adopted a Country Assistance Strategy for FY 2006–08.
Currently the World Bank Group, including the International Finance Corporation (IFC),
is supporting and planning to support 21 projects covering the development of the power
sector; the health care system; developing the education sector; the development of private
business and agriculture; transparency in the management of petroleum resources; supporting
war veterans; promoting leadership and communication, a national employment program and
a comprehensive framework for youth policy. The CAS provided for a total amount of IDA
grants of about US$ 25 million. One of the largest overall programs is a Planning and
Financial Management Capacity Building Project, approved in March 2006, that amounts to
$37 million with $7 million from IDA and $30 million from development partners.
6.
As budget support is no longer required given the increase in petroleum revenue, the
CSP program will be replaced by donor support for the Government’s 2008 National
Priorities. These include six priority areas where progress could lead to a transformation in
the under-performing economy and improve significantly the lives of Timor-Leste’s one
million citizens. These six priorities are: i) transparent management of the country’s
petroleum resources; ii) budget execution; iii) addressing the youth crisis; iv) creating an
environment for private investment; v) improving service delivery; and vi) protecting the
most vulnerable

The World Bank used to co-chair the Timor-Leste Development Partners Meeting
(TLDPM) with the Government of Timor-Leste. The seventh and latest TLDPM took place
at the end of March 2008 and it was just chaired by the Government. The World Bank and
UNMIT (UN Integrated Mission to Timor-Leste) helped the preparation of the government’s
background paper to the TLDPM.

ANNEX III. TIMOR-LESTE: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of May 2, 2008)
1.
Timor-Leste joined the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) on July 24, 2002. To date,
there has been no lending to the country. However, like other international financial
institutions and bilateral donors, the AsDB has been actively involved in the reconstruction
and development of the economy since late 1999.
2.
The AsDB’s involvement has centered around co-managing with the World Bank the
Trust Fund for East Timor (TFET), which was established in December 1999 as a vehicle to
provide grant assistance for reconstruction activities and economic development in TimorLeste.2 Under the TFET, the AsDB has managed six projects with total funding of
$51.7 million,3 which aimed at the rehabilitation of physical infrastructure (urban and rural
power, national roads, ports, and water and sanitation) and the development of microfinance.
3.
In the wake of the post-referendum destruction, the focus of the projects was on
providing emergency assistance, but subsequently shifted to meeting the country’s long-term
development needs. The AsDB’s Country Operations Business Plan 2008 to 2010 identifies
infrastructure development and management as the primary focus of ADB support to TimorLeste. An ongoing road rehabilitation project ($10 million grant) and Dili water supply
project ($6 million grant) are funded through the 9th Asian Development Fund (ADF IX).
The recently negotiated ADF X allocates approximately $20 million for the first biennial
period 2009-2010, entirely on a grant basis. Most of this money will support road
maintenance, rehabilitation, and improvement. Additional ADB technical assistance will
average approximately $2 million per annum. Allocations will be confirmed in a new
Country Partnership Strategy for 2009-2013. Timor-Leste is the recipient of AsDB’s largest
ever technical assistance (TA) grant, the Infrastructure Project Management TA. This $15
million 4 year package finances international and domestic project engineers, procurement
specialists, and others to work within the Ministry of Infrastructure to help plan, prepare, and
execute the Government’s capital development program.
4.
AsDB is currently preparing a private sector development support program, with a
likely focus on access to finance (secured transactions) and public-private-partnerships in
infrastructure development. AsDB has also intensified efforts to strengthen and divest the
Microfinance Institute of Timor-Leste (IMfTL).

See footnote 1 in Relations with the World Bank Group.

These projects comprise the Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project ($29.8 million); the Emergency
Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project 2 ($9 million); the Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation Project
($4.5 million); the Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation Project 2 ($4.5 million); the Hera Fisheries Port
Facilities Rehabilitation Project ($1 million); and the Microfinance Development Project (originally $4 million,
but reduced to $2.7 million)

ANNEX IV. TIMOR-LESTE: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision to the Fund has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance.
Weaknesses remain in the macroeconomic data, especially in the balance of payments and
the national accounts. Prior to 1999, macroeconomic data were compiled by the Indonesian
Central Bureau of Statistics (Badan Pusat Statistik, BPS) and the Central Board of Statistics
of the East Timor Province. Balance of payments statistics were almost nonexistent as
Timor-Leste was treated as one of the Indonesian provinces. Data compilation was seriously
disrupted in 1999, as the post-referendum turmoil destroyed databases, and institutional
capacity collapsed after most Indonesian statistical officers left.
During reconstruction, international financial institutions and bilateral donors provided
technical assistance. A multi-sector Fund statistics mission visited Dili in November 2000
and assisted the authorities in establishing objectives for restoring economic statistics and in
setting up a Statistical Division in the Ministry of Planning and Finance in 2001. A long-term
resident statistical advisor assisted the Statistical Division during November 2001–February
2004, and was succeeded by a new resident advisor until September 2005.
National accounts
Under a World Bank-financed project, national accounts data for 2000 (both sector and
expenditure basis) were estimated by the Boston Institute for Developing Economies (BIDE).
In late 2004, BIDE, under a follow-up World Bank project, produced GDP estimates for
2001-03 that suffer from limited source data and substantial extrapolation. The Division of
Statistics has not been able to replicate the BIDE estimation exercise. Consequently,
estimates of GDP (including for the oil sector) have been prepared by Fund staff. To improve
national accounts data, appropriate staff and substantial efforts in data collection and
compilation are needed. The authorities have secured a commitment from the World Bank
for further support on national accounts.
Prices, employment, and wages
A consumer price index has been compiled monthly for Dili and for the whole country. To
address quality weaknesses, in particular inappropriate and outdated weights, the commodity
basket and the weighting scheme were revised in mid-2003 under a donor-supported project,
and a new monthly index for Dili has been compiled, with December 2001 as the base
period. A further update of CPI weights based on detailed consumption patterns is not
expected before 2009 as the authorities are focusing on the conduct of a World Bank living
standards measurement survey.

9
Annual data on public sector employment and wages are available through fiscal records. No
official data are compiled regularly on private sector employment and wages, except for
partial data from household surveys conducted jointly by UNDP, ADB, and the World Bank.
Government financial statistics
Official data on central government revenue and expenditure are published semi-annually.
Audited annual financial statements of the executed budget are made available to APD as
soon as they are released, normally three months after the end of the fiscal year. In addition,
monthly data are available on request through the budget, treasury, and revenue services. The
compilation of revenue and expenditure follows the classification of the Manual on
Government Finance Statistics (GFSM 1986) (including expenditure based on both
functional and economic classification). Data on the execution of expenditure carried over
from past fiscal years are not yet compiled and reported regularly. Only partial data are
available on fiscal and quasi-fiscal activities undertaken by bilateral donors outside the
central government budget. Currently, there are four non-financial public enterprises, which
are treated as government agencies and data on their operations are available in the audited
annual financial statements. No data are currently reported for the GFS Yearbook and the
International Financial Statistics.
Monetary accounts
Monetary statistics are compiled by the Banking and Payments Authority (BPA), generally
following the methodology of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. However, data
are incomplete because of the absence of official data on public currency holdings—which
are difficult to compile under the current currency regime—and of bank’s positions with
public nonfinancial corporations. The BPA publishes a quarterly bulletin and an annual
report with key monetary aggregates.
Detailed monthly monetary data are now available from July 2002 onward following the
introduction of the standardized report forms (SRFs). Beginning in February 2008, monetary
data are reported to the IMF for publication in the International Financial Statistics and IFS
Supplement on Monetary and Financial Statistics. SRF-based data will be used for the
Fund’s operational and publication purposes. The BPA is planning to introduce a new call
report form in 2008 to obtain balance sheet information from other depository corporations.
A follow-up mission has been tentatively scheduled during FY09 to assist the authorities in
this endeavor.

10
Balance of payments
No official data are available, except on merchandise exports and imports (starting March
2000), but no reports are available since July 2007. There are significant gaps in these series,
which are based on customs reports with a breakdown for major commodity categories.
However, data do not include oil and gas exports. Trade data do not include any estimate of
large unrecorded border trade. In the Fund staff estimates, data on oil/gas revenue are
currently recorded as current income based on fiscal data. All other major items in the
balance of payments are estimated by Fund staff on the basis of limited information obtained
from various sources, including bilateral donors and banks. To address institutional
weaknesses in the compilation of the balance of payments, the Ministry of Finance
transferred responsibility for the compilation of the balance of payments to the BPA in 2007.
An STA peripatetic advisor is currently assisting the BPA to develop balance of payments
statistics.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
June 25, 2008
1.
This statement provides information that has become available since the circulation of
the staff report. The new information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
The 2008 mid-year budget update (MYBU) was approved by the Council of
Ministers on June 18 and will shortly be sent to Parliament for consideration. Revenue
estimates are expected to be close to staff’s projections of 424 percent of non-oil GDP.

3.
The proposed MYBU reinforces concerns raised in the staff appraisal, including
the need for well planned and managed spending to guard against waste. While the
proposal reflects the government’s desire to respond to rising commodity prices, the scope is
considerably larger than earlier plans for the rice subsidy. Given still undefined operational
details, weak administrative capacity, and the timing, it is not expected that much of the ESF
appropriation could be spent in the remaining half of the fiscal year. In addition, initial public
reaction suggests the MYBU proposal will encounter significant opposition in Parliament.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 30, 2008

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with Democratic
Republic of Timor-Leste
On June 25, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste. 1
Background
Growth rebounded in 2007, although the civil unrest continues to undermine the economy.
Following negative growth in 2006, the peak year for the civil unrest, non-oil growth is estimated
to have reached almost 8 percent in 2007 and should remain high in 2008. Growth is driven
mainly by the public sector, as government expenditure surges and donor spending remains
high. Agricultural production contracted in 2007 due to drought and locust infestations. Output of
coffee, the main non-oil export commodity, fell by an estimated 20 percent. Private sector
activity remains subdued by the security situation.
Inflation has risen sharply, but remains low relative to regional comparators. Consumer prices
increased by 8.9 percent in 2007 and are likely to stay high in 2008, driven by rising global food
prices and reflecting food’s 60 percent weight in the CPI basket. Fuel prices have also risen in
line with international prices. While government subsidies for rice have partially shielded
consumers, the threat of rice shortages looms. Excluding food prices, inflation was relatively
low, although signs of increased demand-side price pressures are emerging in tight markets,
e.g., in construction materials.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
The weakening U.S. dollar and low inflation contributed to a moderate depreciation of the real
effective exchange rate over the past year. On a nominal trade-weighted basis, the exchange
rate is unchanged relative to 2004. Revenue from off-shore oil/gas continues to surge, reflecting
high international prices. Petroleum revenue reached 340 percent of non-oil GDP in 2007, with
petroleum fund assets increasing to US$2.6 billion at end-March 2008 (about 6 times non-oil
GDP).
The large revenue inflows more than offset the steep increase in government expenditure, as
external and fiscal surpluses further widened. Central government spending almost doubled in
FY2006/07 2 , with a further increase in spending during the second half of 2007, as reflected in
expanding non-oil deficits. Government expenditure drove a surge in merchandise imports,
which also almost doubled to an estimated 51 percent of non-oil GDP.
The increase in government expenditure has more than offset a gradual decline in donor
spending. On a “combined sources” basis, which includes donor spending for projects identified
in the national development plan, total public sector expenditure in FY2008 is expected to reach
101 percent of non-oil GDP. Although the recent civil unrest-related humanitarian needs have
led to new commitments, international assistance is expected to decline further over the coming
years.
Notwithstanding the sharp increase, government spending to date remains far below budgeted
levels, especially for investment spending. Budget execution remains constrained by weak
planning and procurement capacity, as financial management reforms have not yet had a
significant impact. In addition, a large stock of unspent commitments continues to be carried
forward, despite efforts to tighten procedures.
The planned 2008 mid-year budget update (MYBU) includes a significant increase in current
spending appropriations. Additional funds are being allocated for public works programs,
transfers to refugees, veterans and the elderly, and higher public sector salaries. The MYBU
also includes a large appropriation for rice purchases (5.8 percent of GDP) to be used for
subsidized resale to local retailers, distribution to civil servants, and humanitarian assistance.
The 2008 budget update appropriations are expected to exceed the estimated “sustainable”
spending level defined under the Petroleum Fund arrangement, but actual cash expenditure is
likely to be significantly lower.
Access to financial services remains limited and credit growth has stalled. Notwithstanding the
rapid expansion of credit to the private sector following independence (from a small base), still
less than 2 percent of the population use banking facilities. A poor credit culture and weak
enforcement of creditors’ rights, compounded by the recent civil unrest, has led to an increase
in nonperforming loans and provisioning to, respectively, 28 percent and 53 percent of bank

3
lending at end-March 2008. While bank deposits have increased sharply, there has been little
credit growth since 2006, with banks placing excess funds abroad.
The civil unrest and mid-2007 general elections have delayed progress on structural reforms
needed to support non-oil private sector activity. A draft of critical economic legislation is still
pending. The court system is overwhelmed and there is no effective system to enforce
contractual rights or settle disputes. Business licensing regulations appear to have become
more complicated, rather than simplified as needed.
The medium-term outlook is for moderate non-oil growth. The outlook is shaped by, on the one
hand, expected continued favorable oil/gas revenue prospects, and on the other, constraints on
the government’s capacity to spend. Given current trends, the “sustainable” spending level
would be reached within a couple of years as budget execution gradually improves. Under that
assumption, and based on continued slow reform of the business environment, the non-oil
economy should grow by about 5 percent annually over the medium term. A more forceful shift
in the spending mix toward well-planned investment spending and successful business
environment reform would be associated with annual growth rising to above 8 percent and less
inflationary pressure.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors praised the authorities for Timor-Leste’s solid recent macroeconomic
performance. Despite civil unrest, macroeconomic stability has been maintained, aided by a
sound fiscal and monetary framework. Looking forward, the key challenge remains to use the
growing oil and gas revenue to develop a sustainable non-oil economy, while alleviating social
problems and maintaining macroeconomic stability.
Directors believed that the strategy set out in the current National Development Plan remains
valid. This includes the long-term oil and gas revenue savings policy, well-targeted development
spending, a monetary and exchange rate regime that preserves macroeconomic stability, and a
supportive environment for private investment and activity.
To ensure sustainable growth and poverty reduction, Directors stressed the need to encourage
the development of the private sector. The comfortable level of resources should permit a
stepping up of public investment in support of this, particularly in infrastructure and human
capital development, as well as expenditures to address immediate security and humanitarian
needs. Directors welcomed the tax reform, which should promote business formation, and
called for further reforms to simplify business regulations, clarify land tenure rights, and improve
the judicial system.
Directors observed that the increase in government expenditure planned for the midyear 2008
budget will call for careful planning and monitoring to ensure that such expenditure is productive
while avoiding inflationary pressures. Adoption of cash-based budgeting would also be helpful.
Directors noted the importance of enhancing Timor-Leste’s administrative and absorptive

4
capacities so that budget operations are accomplished efficiently and in a timely manner, and in
full accordance with the authorities’ program goals. Continued technical assistance will be
needed in this regard. Looking further ahead, Directors encouraged the authorities to develop a
medium-term fiscal framework that is in line with macroeconomic stability and the country’s
absorptive capacity.
Directors viewed the Petroleum Fund as a cornerstone for sound management of the country’s
resources, ensuring fiscal sustainability and macroeconomic stability. The Fund smoothes
budget spending, provides for investment abroad of resources not required for budget
execution, and mandates transparency in its operations. Looking forward, Directors encouraged
the authorities to preserve these principles. They welcomed the acceptance of Timor-Leste as a
candidate country in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).
Directors agreed that the use of the U.S. dollar as the currency of Timor-Leste has served the
economy well by providing a credible nominal anchor for price stability. They noted the staff
assessment that the current level of the exchange rate appears broadly consistent with its
equilibrium level. They observed that stronger institutional capacity will be needed before
considering a move to introduce a national currency.
Directors welcomed the initiatives to strengthen the financial sector, including the progress
made on a credit registry and the strengthening of banking supervision. Additional efforts are
needed on pending financial sector legislation and the creation of an alternative dispute
resolution mechanism. Any public sector participation in the financial system should be on
commercial terms and supervised under domestic banking laws. Directors cautioned that
proposals to begin external borrowing should be weighed carefully and analyzed transparently
to ensure that such borrowing is adequately concessional, will deliver a clear net positive rate of
return, and is consistent with macroeconomic stability.
Directors commended the authorities for the progress made on the compilation of financial and
balance of payments statistics. They encouraged them to better monitor real sector activity
through the compilation of national accounts.

Statement by Arrigo Sadun, Executive Director for the
Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, and
José Cardoso, Advisor to Executive Director
June 20, 2008

On behalf of the Timorese authorities, we wish to express our sincere gratitude and
appreciation to the staff for the thorough, constructive, and insightful approach to this Article
IV Consultation. The Timorese authorities welcome the IMF consultations, as well as the
very interesting technical discussions and presentations to Timorese officials and staff, since
they provide a unique opportunity to discuss policy options and IMF recommendations.

1. Introduction
Timor-Leste has been gradually reinforcing its democratic institutions and maturity, but this
construction has not been a smooth process. The emergence of the crisis in 2006, triggered by
rivalry within the Timorese security forces that rebelled, and the insecurity resulting from it,
illustrate the extreme fragility of this post-conflict country. Notwithstanding the severe
adversities, the country has already clearly demonstrated its democratic maturity when it
comes to elections. Timor-Leste held a national presidential election in April and May 2007,
and legislative elections in June 2007. These were the first national post-independence
elections organized by the Timorese authorities and, as such, were an important step in the
consolidation of democracy in the country.
The population of Timor-Leste is about one million inhabitants. More than half is illiterate
and most of the labor force (over 4/5) gets its subsistence from agriculture and fishery. After
independence, the population has grown at a rate of about 3.5 percent a year. About 70
percent of the population is under 30-years-old and life expectancy is about 56 years old.
Unemployment rates are high, especially in the capital (home to about a quarter of the labor
force) and among youth aged 15 to 29. In this last group (youth workforce in the capital),
unemployment stands at about 40 percent. The full reintegration of some one hundred
thousand Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) is far from achieved. About 30% of them
continue to reside in 58 camps, mainly in the capital. Timor-Leste is ranked 150 out of 177
countries in the 2007/2008 United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Human
Development Index (HDI). Estimates suggest that as much as 42% of the population is now
below the national poverty line of $0.55 per day, which reveals a deterioration of this
indicator during recent years. Compared with the countries of the ASEAN region, TimorLeste is the poorest country, with non-oil GDP per capita of $378 in 2007.

2. Macroeconomic overview
Following the civil unrest of 2006 — responsible for a contraction of real non-oil GDP
(which excludes offshore oil and natural gas, and the UN contribution to government
operations) of about 5.8 percent — real non-oil GDP is estimated to have rebounded to 7.8
percent in 2007, largely driven by government and donor spending. Economic recovery could
have been higher if not for the unstable security conditions that subdued private activity, and
the drought and locust infestations that generally hit agricultural production. In the case of
coffee, the main export crop, the decline in production was about 20 percent.
The government’s prudent and responsible macroeconomic framework has successfully
contained inflation in Timor-Leste, but recent shocks pose some risks to price stability and
food security to the most vulnerable population.
Important policy measures adopted by the Timorese authorities have proven its effectiveness
in containing inflation, namely (i) the USD as the currency of legal tender — whose
simplicity is well-suited for the country’s constraints and provides an effective nominal
anchor for price stability (notwithstanding the negative effects of its recent depreciation in a
country very dependent upon imports) — along with (ii) the strategy to invest abroad the
wealth from oil-and-gas, and (iii) the responsible fiscal policy tracked by sustainable
spending defined by the Petroleum Fund Law (explained in section 3). Within this adequate
macroeconomic framework, inflation has stood at levels well below that of comparator
countries.
However, the higher international food prices, especially rice, were an exogenous shock that,
along with poor harvests and some difficulties to secure normal imported rice levels,
instigated a hike in inflation in the first quarter of 2007. However, by the end of the year, the
price level had already fallen significantly and inflation averaged 8.9 percent over the year. It
should be noted that food represents a high portion of the CPI (about 58 percent) and that
about half of the food items are imported. Excluding food, inflation actually recorded a slight
reduction in 2007 to under 3.5 percent on average. Whether including or excluding food in
the CPI, inflation in Timor-Leste remains relatively low when compared regionally with
similar countries or with its trading partners.
The authorities recognize that external and supply-side shocks may pose some risks to price
stability. As inflation, essentially on food items, particularly hurts the most vulnerable
population, and since the most pressing item has been the price of rice, the authorities have
decided to import rice for resale to local retailers at subsidized prices. This measure,
representing an additional cost to the budget, has successfully mitigated the pass-through of
international rice prices, and its benefits are being essentially felt by the poor, given the
relatively high portion of their income that is spent on rice.
The external current account and the fiscal position have continued to accrue rising surpluses,
notwithstanding sharply increased government spending, since the offshore oil-and-gas sector
has not been affected by the civil unrest, and reflecting rising revenues due to a peak in
production and high international prices. Petroleum revenue reached 340 percent of non-oil

3
GDP in 2007, with petroleum fund assets increasing to $2.6 billion at end-March 2008 (about
6 times non-oil GDP). The Greater Sunrise oil/gas field could commence production by
2014, although serious questions remain on the project’s financial viability.
The sharp increase recorded during 2007 in government spending must be understood by the
fact that government spending has been covering the gradual decline in donors spending.
Therefore, the rise in total expenditure effectively spent has been much lower than the rise in
government spending. However, the authorities are vigilant to any demand pressures that
might arise given the limited absorption capacity of the domestic economy, especially if the
increasing management capacity starts to produce results on higher rates of budget execution.
The Timorese authorities note that, in the staff’s financial programming for 2008, projected
government cash spending is the double of that in FY2006/07 and 60 percent higher than the
annual rate in the second half of 2007. This is an optimistic sign that the measures in progress
by the Timorese authorities are expected to be effective in strengthening management
capacity.
Additionally, despite the rise in government spending, it remained far below appropriations
and the sum of sustainable resources drawn from the Petroleum Fund, in strict respect of the
Petroleum Fund Law. Less than 60 percent of the transitional 2007 budget (second half of
2007) was spent on a cash basis, with an execution rate of just 12 percent for capital
expenditure. The carry-over of financial resources, due to significant execution difficulties
that delay spending to the next financial year, does not represent a violation of the Petroleum
Fund Law. Resources drawn from the Petroleum Fund have respected the annual estimated
sustainable limits established by the Law. Some procedures have already been introduced to
limit the carry-over of obligations between fiscal years, but the authorities recognize that the
execution constraints will continue to be felt for the near future, although less pronouncedly
over time.
As to the financial system, the rise in nonperforming loans and provisioning reflect
essentially the deterioration of the recent past security conditions. At present, the fact that
several commercial banks — which are branches of foreign banks — already expressed
interest in opening new branches within the country outside the capital suggests no evidence
of a systemic risk.

3. Oil and gas resources
With the purpose of managing the revenues from oil-and-gas production in a way to assure
not only inter-generational equity but also fiscal sustainability, the Timorese authorities
established in 2005 the Timor-Leste Petroleum Fund, modeled after the Norwegian
petroleum fund experience on such type of sovereign wealth fund, and with the valued
support from the IMF and other external partners. The Petroleum Fund is integrated into the
central government budget. Transfers from the Petroleum Fund to the budget are subject to a
spending ceiling set on the basis of the fiscal sustainability policy. The annual sustainable
spending is equal to the sum of the estimated permanent (interest) income from the
oil-and-gas wealth and domestic non-oil revenue. The Petroleum Fund Law allows drawings
to exceed the sustainable level, if necessary and justifiable as being in the long-term interest
of the country, under approval by the parliament, through a highly responsible and

4
transparent process, but this option has never been used. The Petroleum Fund assets are
invested abroad to limit risk and minimize real exchange rate appreciation pressures.
The Minister of Planning and Finance is responsible for the overall management and
investment strategy of the Petroleum Fund, and the operational management is the
responsibility of the Banking and Payments Authority (BPA) — the incumbent central bank.
The BPA submits quarterly reports on the performance of the Petroleum Fund to the Minister
of Planning and Finance. In turn, the Ministry publishes an annual report containing a more
complete description of the Petroleum Fund’s activities and the financial statements certified
by an internationally recognized audit firm. The Petroleum Fund is generally considered at
the top of international rankings for transparency and accountability. Additionally, an
Investment Advisory Board provides strategic investment advice concerning the investments
of the Petroleum Fund to the Minister of Planning and Finance, and an independent
Consultative Council advises Parliament on Petroleum Fund issues.
Regarding the investment strategy, all assets have been invested in short and medium-term
U.S. government bonds and managed passively to track the Merrill Lynch US government
bond index. The government recognizes that it is now time to develop a long-term investment
strategy. In this regard, the Timorese authorities announced this month that a step was
already taken forward in the operational management of the Petroleum Fund by signing a
Global Custody Agreement, following an international tender procurement process, with an
internationally recognized financial services firm, to act as the global custodian for the
Petroleum Fund’s assets.
Besides the effective custody of the investments, the Agreement also includes the
provisioning of related services. This firm will receive and arrange the settlement of trading
instructions from external managers, and will monitor their performance. This step will
support the future appointment of specialized external managers to manage portions of the
Petroleum Fund, a necessary move to implement the government’s intention to broaden the
investment mandate of the Petroleum Fund, in order to achieve higher long-term returns.
Additionally, this firm will also provide the BPA with investment performance and
compliance services, as well as the Petroleum Fund’s financial accounting and reporting.
This is the first step in the implementation of the BPA’s strategy to form a team of finance
professionals to manage the assets of the Petroleum Fund. The Timorese authorities
appreciate the assistance of the World Bank and BIS for the initial phase of this challenging
process.
After some meetings of Timor-Leste's Multi-Stakeholder Working Group for the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) initiated last year — which brought together
representatives from relevant government agencies, civil society, and the petroleum
industry — Timor Leste was accepted in February as an EITI Candidate Country. The
Secretary of State of Natural Resources is the government official responsible for
undertaking the EITI validation. In this area — as in the one related to the Petroleum Fund —
the Timorese authorities are deeply committed to fully complying with the international bestpractices.

4. Poverty reduction and structural reforms
Despite the broadly recognized meritorious efforts to manage oil-and-gas resources, progress
on economic and social development has been more elusive, and the population has yet to see
any real change in their daily lives. A general perception exists that the wealth from
oil-and-gas resources has not been directed to social support, which has put significant
pressure on solving immediate social problems. However, the problem has resided on the
country’s poor budget execution, namely on investment spending, due to a weak
administrative capacity and, to some extent, domestic disturbances. The Timorese authorities
recognize that the broad challenge is how to implement economic and social development
measures to alleviate immediate social needs and security problems, while developing a
strong non-oil economy and maintaining low inflation. In this regard, we should distinguish
between short-term priorities and long-term priorities.
Short-term priorities pursue the immediate goal of food security and social cohesion. An
important measure to assure food security was the subsidization of the price of rice, which
successfully shielded the most vulnerable population from the threat of famine due to supply
shortages looms, weather disturbances, and plagues that have recently disrupted agricultural
production. Additionally, after the 2006 civil unrest, the authorities have been vigilant to
factors that might trigger threats to the security conditions. A pacification policy has been
followed to ensure public safety through the reintegration of petitioners from the 2006
rebellion into military and civilian life, and IDPs into an integrated life, with particular
attention to housing, under the National Recovery Strategy endorsed by the Timorese
authorities in December 2007 with the involvement of the United Nations, development
partners, and civil society. Finally, the severe difficulties that elderly and disabled people are
facing are also being addressed. All these measures — further strengthened in the 2008 midyear budget update, recently approved by the Council of Ministers and to be sent to
parliament shortly — respond to the rationale that it is not possible to foster economic
development without solving first the most basic needs of food security and social cohesion.
Long-term priorities aim the development of a sustainable non-oil economy within a stable
macroeconomic environment. For more than two decades in the recent past, the public
administration employed civil servants with very low levels of productivity, while productive
sectors of the economy were left underdeveloped. As a result of this approach — which is
still a very entrenched mindset — the private sector continues to be very insipient, consisting
of micro and small-businesses that have been unable to create employment and are very
much dependent upon Government contracts. The authorities are determined to reform the
business environment — which has been constraining some meritorious private initiatives
and, according to the recent 2008 Doing Business report, is still ranked very low, although
improving — to enhance competitiveness and to promote a self-creating employment private
sector. In this regard, the authorities agree on the need to strengthen public investment in
three areas: (i) infrastructure, namely road building, housing, water supply, and electricity
generation, among other important projects, using labor-intensive strategies whenever
possible and adequate, to promote employment among a vast low-skilled population;
(ii) human capital, through the strengthening of the educational system and professional
qualification (including the introduction of a policy of free basic education and nine years of
compulsory attendance in school); and (iii) institutional and regulatory framework.

6
In this last area, an important incentive to foster the private sector is the tax reform recently
approved by parliament. The new non-petroleum tax system significantly reduced tax rates,
lowered compliance costs, and streamlined regulations. The expected decline in non-oil tax
revenue, from about 10 percent to 5 percent of non-oil GDP, is a budgetary cost that the
authorities assume in this effort to create the necessary conditions to boost a formal private
sector in Timor-Leste, taking advantage of the sustainable fiscal space derived from
oil-and-gas revenues.
Now that the tax reform has been completed, the authorities plan to address other important
bottlenecks to the economic activity, namely: (i) to promote measures to expand access to
financial services, especially in the districts, by encouraging the expansion of existing
commercial banks’ branches of established foreign banks, and by creating a National
Development Bank, run on a commercial basis and supervised under domestic financial law
(although the plans for the National Development Bank are still under analysis); (ii) to
implement a land reform, expected to be completed by the end of the year, in order to create a
framework for land ownership, titling, and registration; and (iii) to advance with the judicial
reform, including judicial decisions enforcement. For these purposes, again, substantial
physical and human investment is necessary, along with technical support to create the
necessary expertise.
If a strategy of external debt borrowing is adopted to cope with the financial requirements for
these long-term priorities, one of the areas in which expertise would have to start from
scratch would be debt management. Being one of the youngest countries in the world,
Timor-Leste has no external public debt. Although eventually justifiable from a financial
point of view, the recourse to external financing will have to be carefully studied through a
cost/benefit analysis. For the very immediate future, external financing could prove to be less
favorable when compared with the possibility of using resources from the Petroleum Fund.
Given the lower donor support and the above explained severe needs that the country is
facing, the 2008 mid-year budget update, to be sent to parliament shortly, presents those
needs and justifies, as being in the long-term interest of the country, spending above the
estimated sustainability limit. Notwithstanding the still pressing execution difficulties that
probably will contain spending below this limit, the government — conscientious of a
potential inflationary risk from higher government spending in a country with a limited
absorption capacity — intends to contain any inflationary pressures, which may be felt
essentially on construction materials. In this regard — and included in a broad measure to
keep a tight vigilance on price developments, under the exchange rate regime of official
dollarization — the government already approved this week the establishment of a Fund for
Economic Stability, to contain the rise in prices of food, fuels, and construction materials.
Therefore, the medium-term goal of this Fund is to reconstruct the capacity of the economy
and to develop programs to help the population deal with the effects of the crisis, in support
of the achievement of the above explained short and long-term priorities within a stable
macroeconomic framework.
To conclude, we emphasize that all the decisions already taken and to be sent to parliament
for approval respect the Law and all the transparency requirements that characterize the
Timor-Leste Petroleum Fund.

5. Final remarks
Timor-Leste is living a time of great opportunity. After the rebel attacks in February, the
rebels have surrendered, disturbances have significantly diminished, and the country has
returned to a state of normalcy. However, the fragility of this post-conflict country remains
latent pending the near-term consolidation of the social cohesion and the eradication of food
insecurity, and the long-term development of a sustainable formal non-oil economy. Under
the current circumstances, the involvement of the international community is essential to
sustain the current juncture.
On the economic sphere, in which the IMF has a particular role and responsibility, the task is
huge and requires a permanent in situ counseling. The Timorese authorities reiterate their
high appreciation for the IMF support and count on the current level of involvement to not be
abruptly interrupted in the immediate future. To conclude, the Timorese authorities express
their deepest appreciation for the competence and personal engagement of the IMF resident
representative.
