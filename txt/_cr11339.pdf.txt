REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 7, 2011

KEY ISSUES
Economic and political environment. Following a severe recession in FY2008–09, the
economy grew by 5.2 percent in FY2010, mainly driven by an expansion in fisheries and
exports and moderating fuel prices. The fiscal situation has improved somewhat, but
general elections scheduled for late November add to spending pressures.
Outlook and risks. The recovery is expected to continue, but prospects over the medium
term are overshadowed by the scheduled declines in foreign grants and sluggish private
sector. Risks to the outlook are on the downside, stemming mainly from a protracted
global slowdown. The weak financial position of some public enterprises could hinder
economic activities and erode public finances. Fluctuations in fuel and food prices would
also pose a substantial risk given the RMI’s high dependence on commodity imports.
Fiscal sustainability. Achieving long-term budgetary self-reliance and sustained growth
remains a challenge. Under the baseline projection, sluggish growth and fiscal
adjustment imply a large projected revenue shortfall in FY2023 when Compact grants are
set to expire. Closing this revenue gap would require a fiscal adjustment of around
4 percent of GDP over the medium term. It would be important to start implementing
reforms early to create fiscal space and address possible setbacks.
Fiscal and structural reforms. To achieve this adjustment would require comprehensive
public sector and structural reforms that build on ongoing efforts to unlock private sector
growth. These include: (i) swift implementation of tax reform; (ii) targeted expenditure
cuts; (iii) accelerated reforms of the state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and; (iv) removal of
obstacles to private sector development.
Financial sector. The banking sector remains liquid and profitable, but contributes little
to growth. Credit risks from heavily-indebted households could rise. The Banking
Commission’s oversight should be broadened to include the development bank and
private lending institutions to safeguard financial stability.

REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

INTRODUCTION
1.
The Republic of the Marshall Islands
(RMI) is a small island country in the north
Pacific highly dependent on external aid,
mainly from the United States. The renewal
of the Compact of Free Association Agreement
in 2004 has provided a stream of stable, but
declining grants aimed primarily at education,
health, and infrastructure sectors. After
Compact grants expire in 2023, the RMI is
expected to complement its domestic
revenues with returns from its Compact Trust
Fund (CTF), which receives annual savings from
fiscal surpluses along with donor contributions.
2.
Achieving fiscal and economic selfsufficiency remains a huge challenge and is
exacerbated by the difficult political
situation. Like other small Pacific Island
countries, the RMI is vulnerable to external
shocks given its geographical remoteness and

structural impediments. Given the pressures on
public finances from scheduled declines in
Compact grants, growth prospects remain
weak over the medium term, requiring decisive
policy measures to put the economy on
a sound footing. The outlook for key reforms,
however, is clouded by the political
uncertainties surrounding the general elections
scheduled in late November.
3.
Against
this
background,
the
Article IV discussions focused on policies to
achieve long-term economic and fiscal
sustainability. The key issue was how to
strengthen fiscal management building on
government efforts to implement tax reforms,
cut current expenditures, and reform ailing
SOEs. Staff also discussed policies to promote
the private sector and strengthen the financial
system.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS

FY2010, but mostly as a result of unspent
earmarked appropriations. Only a modest
surplus ($0.4 million) was recorded in the
general fund for discretionary uses in FY2010.
The overall surplus in FY2011 is estimated to
be modest, with a 5.5 percent across-theboard cut of current expenditures and
additional revenues from fishing fees partly
offset by temporary tax exemptions on food
and other basic consumables and increased
subsidies and transfers to public enterprises to
cover operating losses. Despite a potential
upside of higher fisheries revenue, the fiscal
outlook will continue to be hindered by weak
financial positions in the SOEs and limited
budget planning, unless reforms in these areas
are accelerated. Over the medium term, fiscal
balance is expected to be modest at about
1 percent of GDP.
6.
The deterioration in the current
account is expected to continue until
FY2013 due to temporary factors. The
widening of the current account deficit since
FY2009 reflects increased imports under the
Kwajalein land use agreements (LUA), 1 new
investments in the fisheries sector and the
airport extension project, which have been
financed mainly through foreign direct
investment and capital grants. Tourism
receipts declined after the discontinuation of
charter flight services, but this has had a
limited impact on the external balance given
its small share in services receipts. Once these
temporary factors expire, the current account
deficit beyond FY2013 is expected to decline
to around 5 percent of GDP. Though external
1

The LUA was reached between the RMI government
and Kwajalein landowners in May 2011, under which
the landowners would allow U.S. military operations in
Kwajalein until 2066. The agreement also authorized
the disbursement of about $32 million from the U.S.
government to the landowners. Part of the inflow
contributes to the economy through consumption and
investment, while a majority is expected to flow out
overseas in the form of deposits.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

debt is relatively high at about $117 million
(about two-thirds of GDP) as of end-FY2011, it
is mainly on concessional terms and is
expected to decline.
7.
The recovery is likely to continue in
the near term, but medium-term prospects
are overshadowed by the scheduled
declines in Compact grants. Growth in
FY2011 is estimated at about 5 percent, driven
by higher fish catches from the newly
commissioned purse seiners (fishing boats),
large inflows from the Kwajalein LUA, and the
FAA-funded airport extension project. Over the
medium term, staff expects growth to stay low
at around 1½ percent with the growth in
fisheries sector partly offset by the decline in
Compact grants (about $½ million per annum
before adjusting for inflation).
8.
Pressures on domestic prices from
rising commodity prices in early 2011 are
likely to subside. Inflation increased following
the significant rise in commodity prices in early
2011, but is projected to moderate gradually
(Box 1). Domestic price movements over the
medium term are projected to be broadly in
line with those in the United States reflecting
the close trading ties and the use of the U.S.
dollar as the legal tender. However, prices are
likely to remain highly volatile with fuel and
food prices constituting nearly half of the CPI
basket.
9.
Risks to the outlook are on the
downside. The economy could face stiff
headwinds if the global slowdown proves
severe and prolonged (Box 2). Overseas
investments are also likely to suffer losses. The
weak financial position of the SOEs (operating
losses before government contributions
among key SOEs were $7 million in FY2010)
could erode public finances (Figure 2). Growth
could further weaken under a protracted
global slowdown if the planned foreign
investments in fisheries were withheld due to
higher uncertainty. On the upside, further

REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

investment in commercial fisheries could
generate positive spillovers to the rest of the
economy. The pending U.S. funded satellite
project in Kwajalein might also create new jobs
that offset lay-offs from the downsizing of the

Kwajalein military base. Longer-term risks
include continued outward migration and
shore erosion on local atolls from climate
change.

Box. 1. Marshall Islands: The Impact of High Fuel and Food Prices
The RMI relies heavily on fuel and food imports and was not shielded from the surge in food and
commodity prices. Similar to other Pacific Island countries, which rely heavily on fuel and food imports, the
RMI’s share of fuel and food imports in merchandise imports are 27.4 percent and 30.5 percent, respectively,
as of FY2010.
The RMI has almost full pass-through of food and fuel prices with a lag of about two months for fuel
and 3-6 months for food. When commodity prices rose sharply in 2008, inflation soared to 14.7 percent.
The price of rice, which is a main imported staple in the RMI and accounts for 13.5 percent of the CPI food
basket, also rose significantly.
Domestic prices returned to trend in FY2009–10 as commodity prices subsided, but is estimated to
rise in FY2011. In the first four months of 2011, oil prices increased by about 30 percent from the same
period in 2010 before moderating in recent months, pushing up the projected year-on-year CPI increase in
FY2011 to around 9.5 percent. The recent episode of high global fuel prices did not lead to a drastic
increase in RMI’s domestic fuel prices as in 2008-09, likely due to tax exemptions on fuel in effect since
2008. Domestic fuel prices are, however, rigid downward due to the limited competition in the supply of
fuels.
The high and immediate pass-through of commodity prices could worsen both fiscal and external
positions. Higher commodity prices would likely raise the import bill and government spending on goods
and services. A case in point was the transfer of $8 million from the government to the Marshalls Energy
Company (MEC) in 2008 to ensure continued oil procurement in the midst of high world oil prices. This
transfer alone constituted 5 percent of GDP. An increase in the oil prices by 30 percent from 2011 level
would lower the growth in FY2012 by 1.4 percent (from 5.4 percent in baseline) and the current account
balance would worsen.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS

Box 2. Marshall Islands: Implications of the Global Slowdown and Financial Turmoil
Although the RMI has so far been weathered well the global financial turmoil, the economy is
vulnerable to a protracted global slowdown and deepening financial crisis. In addition to the direct
impact of declining asset prices on its sizeable investment overseas, the RMI is likely to be affected through
the following channels:



Weaker exports and fiscal revenues. RMI’s exports represent around 23 percent of GDP, with the
United States and East Asia—mainly China, Taiwan, Province of China, and Japan—as the largest export
destinations. A sharp slowdown in advanced economies with spillovers to Asia would reduce demand
for fish and copra exports. Lower fish prices would further erode export values and fiscal revenues from
fishing fees. Export competitiveness could weaken if the global slowdown led to U.S. dollar appreciation
as investors seek safer assets.



Uncertainty of foreign direct investment and official aid flows. Global slowdown could put existing
foreign investment plans—particularly in fisheries—on hold as investors face higher uncertainty and
tighter financing conditions. Although annual Compact grants are unlikely to change, other aid flows
and concessional lending could come under pressure as donors face tighter budget constraints.



Insufficient trade finance. A global slowdown could curtail trade financing, raising the risk of a sharp
fall in international trade as happened during 2008-09. Although importers do not rely heavily on trade
credits, their overseas suppliers could be adversely affected by tighter credit conditions, forcing them to
raise shipping cost or to reduce trade volumes.



Lower disposable income. Many migrant workers in lower-skills jobs in the United States may be at
risk in a softening U.S. labor market, requiring more support from their families in the RMI. Returning
workers could also put downward pressure on local wages.



Declining value of overseas investment. In addition to the Compact Trust Fund, the banking system
and social security fund also have large overseas exposure through their foreign asset holdings, which
make up nearly two-thirds of their assets. Much of this comprises of U.S. Treasuries, and U.S. and global
equities. Banks’ concerns over potential losses could cut back their lending. Lower U.S. interest rates
would generate capital gains on their bond holdings, but over the longer term could depress net
interest margins.

Near-term growth prospects would worsen if the global slowdown and financial turmoil proves to be
more severe and protracted. During FY2008–09, the economy underwent severe recession where growth
fell to 3 percent below its potential and the CTF faced a cumulative investment loss of over 20 percent.
A protracted global slowdown this time could also pose significant costs to the RMI. Overseas investments
are estimated to have fallen by about 10 percent (based on the CTF’s asset allocation) since June. Growth
could slow by a half to a range of 2–3 percent in FY2012, and could further weaken if the planned foreign
investment in fisheries was held back due to uncertainty of global outlook.

The Authorities’ Views
10.
Compared to staff’s projection, the
authorities expected a higher growth due
to the strong expansion of fisheries. On this
basis, officials forecast near-term growth of
9.0 and 8.8 percent in FY2011 and FY2012,
respectively, compared to staff’s projection of

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5.2 percent on average. While sharing the
authorities’ views that fishery expansion and
construction activities have been key drivers of
near-term growth, staff sees that the new
investment will take time before reaching full
operation while the inflows with the LUA has
so far had smaller-than-expected positive

REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

spillover to the overall economy. The
authorities agreed the growth prospects would
be hindered by the scheduled declines in
Compact grants over the medium term.
11.
The authorities also emphasized
upside risks to the staff projections. The
downsizing of Kwajalein military base was
smaller than initially expected (15 layoffs
versus 100–120 anticipated), and learning from
the previous experience in FY2008–09, the
authorities considered themselves better
prepared for a surge in food and fuel prices.
For instance, electricity tariffs now have a builtin mechanism to reflect global oil price
movements. While the authorities recognized
the economy’s vulnerability to external shocks

via trade and foreign investment channels in
addition to direct overseas investment losses,
they believed that the economy was more
resilient this time given the ongoing fishery
expansion and construction activities. They
also have the policy option to extend some tax
exemptions to mitigate the impact of a shock.
12.
Officials also expected better fiscal
performances for FY2011–12. A strong
economic recovery would bring in more tax
revenues through personal income tax and
import duties, while the regional efforts to
manage fish stock through the Parties to the
Nauru Agreement (PNA) would bring in more
fishing fees. Earlier efforts on expenditure
control should also improve the fiscal outrun.

B. External Stability and Exchange Rate
Background and Staff’s Views
13.
The risks to external stability appear
to be limited. The current account deficits are
expected to remain wide until FY2013, mainly
related to investment in fisheries and airport
extension project mainly financed through
foreign direct investments and capital grants.
Compact financial flows dominate external
balances and will continue to provide a stable
source of funding over the next decade.
External debt is expected to decline, as debt
repayments rise in the coming years. The use
of the U.S. dollar as the domestic currency
remains appropriate given the small size of the
economy and its close financial linkages with
the United States.
14.
The RMI’s real exchange rate
appears to be in line with the medium-term
fundamentals of the economy. The real
appreciation in FY2008–09 was largely
reversed in the second half of 2009 as
domestic
prices
stabilized.
More
fundamentally, exports have continued to
expand, in contrast to some other Pacific
Island countries. In the long run, the expiration

of the Compact grants could, however, lead to
an erosion of foreign assets undermining
external stability unless the authorities
undertake needed fiscal adjustments and
structural reforms.
Authorities’ Views
15.
The authorities agreed that the
near-term risks to external stability were
contained. They also indicated the use of the
U.S. dollar remained appropriate and the
Compact grants would continue to provide
stable funding over the next decade. They
noted that the fishery expansion seem to
suggest the RMI’s competitiveness on key
sectors had improved.
16.
External debt is not a key concern at
the moment. The authorities noted that, while
external debt has slightly risen owing to the
new program with the Asian Development
Bank (AsDB), a large portion of debt was on
concessionary terms with a relatively long
grace period. Interest payments would rise in
the coming years, but are likely to remain
manageable.

POLICIES TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE GROWTH
A. Fiscal Policy and Public Sector Modernization
Background

Policy Issues and Staff’s Views

17.
Under current policies, the build up
in government assets in the Trust Fund is
projected to fall short of replacing
Compact grants expiring in FY2023. In
particular, the global financial crisis, by
reducing investment returns, has made it
more difficult to achieve long-term budgetary
self-reliance. The market value of the CTF
stood at $142 million (82 percent of GDP) as
of end-June 2011, but is likely to have
declined
since
then
following
the
deterioration in global equities markets
(see chart). Under the assumption that all
Compact grants would expire in FY2023, the
projected income from the CTF would fall
short of replacing these grants by as much as
$15.4 million (about 8½ percent of GDP) in
FY2023 (see Box 3). Even under a more
optimistic assumption that non-Compact
sector grants would be extended beyond
FY2023, the shortfall—about $4.1 million—is
still sizeable and warrants prompt action to
ensure sustainability.2

18.
Steadily increasing fiscal surpluses
to about 5 percent of GDP by FY2016
would
help
achieve
long-term
sustainability. This would involve gradually
raising the fiscal surplus by about 1 percent
per year for the next four years to 5 percent of
GDP in FY2016, and then maintaining the
surplus at that level until FY2023. The required
fiscal
adjustment
could
increase
by
2.3 percentage points if both medium-term
growth prospects and investment returns of
the CTF worsened from the baseline by
1 percent. Staff reiterated the importance of
starting implementing reforms early to create
fiscal space and address possible setbacks.
Staff supported the recent transfer of
$1.1 million to the CTF during FY2011 and the
plan to continue such transfers in the FY2012
budget. In view of the substantial adjustment
required, higher-than-expected revenues from
the fisheries sector should be saved and
transferred to the CTF.3

19.
Achieving
the
required
fiscal
adjustment will require targeted cuts in
expenditures. The government has initiated
cumulative across-the-board cuts of over
10 percent in current expenditures over the
past two years. To avoid compromising quality
public services, such as spending for the poor,
a more targeted approach is needed.

The contributions to the Compact Trust Fund
(Accounts A and C) are not available for withdrawal
prior to FY2023. A separate account (Account D)
where the RMI and other donors could contribute to
is available for withdrawal if it exceeds $10 million
(currently stands at about $7 million), which could be
used to mitigate adverse impact of potential shocks.

REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 3. Marshall Islands: Long-term Fiscal Sustainability
This box assesses the RMI’s long-term fiscal sustainability under the amended Compact agreement,
updating the estimates in the 2009 Article IV Consultation Staff Report. The analysis considers implications
for sustainability after the financial provisions under the amended Compact expire in FY2023. Fiscal
sustainability is measured by the usable government’s asset position as of FY2023 that would generate an
investment income large enough to supplement expiring Compact-related grants without significantly
disrupting public services and eroding the Compact Trust Fund value. The analysis is based on a broader
perspective than what the CTF was designed to specifically support.1
The assessment of the long-term fiscal outlook considers three scenarios. The baseline scenario features
limited fiscal adjustment and structural reforms, while a policy action scenario takes into account
comprehensive fiscal reforms, including swift implementation of tax reforms by FY2012, targeted expenditure
cuts, and structural reforms to strengthen private sector development. Finally, under the downside risks
scenario, we gauge the impact of possible adverse shocks on the required fiscal adjustment.
1) Baseline scenario
This scenario assumes that the government maintains a modest fiscal surplus of about 1 percent of GDP over
the medium term, and GDP growth gradually declines to about 1½ percent over the medium term as foreign
grants decline while private sector growth remains sluggish, and stays at that level after the financial
provisions under the amended Compact expire.
Under the baseline scenario, the CTF’s income flows would not be sufficient to cover Compact grants
in FY2024. The nominal rate of return in FY2010 was about 8 percent, slightly lower than the projected
return of about 10 percent assumed in the 2009 Article IV report. This return is then set to decline to an
historical average of 6 percent in the medium term. Compact related grants (net of fiscal surplus) are
projected to reach $39.1 million in FY2023. Under the terms of the Compact Agreement and without
additional grants, the CTF’s investment earnings are projected to be $35.5 million. However, in order to
preserve the real value of the fund, the government would only be able to withdraw $23.7 million, leaving
a gap of $15.4 million to fully replace expired grants after FY2024 (see text table). Therefore, in the baseline
scenario, the government would either need to erode the real value of the CTF or face a large budgetary
shortfall.
While higher returns could support the value of the fund, maintaining such high returns over a long
period is not realistic. For example, the shortfall would be eliminated if the average rate of return reached
8.2 percent. However, higher returns would be possible with a more aggressive investment strategy, albeit at
the cost of higher risks. In that regard, the baseline assumes a relatively conservative investment strategy
with an average nominal rate of return of 6 percent.
2) Policy action scenario
This scenario continues to assume a nominal rate of return of 6 percent. With these assumptions, fiscal
sustainability would be achieved with a fiscal surplus of around 5 percent in FY2016. The surplus stays at this
level until FY2023 then declines to about 1.5 percent.

With fiscal consolidation, the government
will be able to rely on a constant revenue
stream to finance its expenditures. In
particular, under the policy action scenario, the
government keeps the level of capital
spending roughly constant throughout the
projection period. Current expenditures are
adjusted such that total revenues can both
finance total expenditures and generate
enough savings to build up the CTF. After
FY2024, there is no need to save additional
amounts to top up the CTF, with total revenues
including interest income obtained from the
CTF used only to finance current level of
expenditures.

The required fiscal adjustment is sensitive to assumptions on medium-term growth and investment
returns. If medium-term growth rate is 1 percentage point lower than the baseline projection and at the
same time the assumed rate of return is lower by 1 percentage point until FY2023, the required fiscal surplus
would be 7.3 percent of GDP instead of 5 percent of GDP under the baseline, higher by 2.3 percent of GDP.

REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS

Targeted cuts in areas proposed by the
Comprehensive Adjustment Program (CAP)
group could achieve a saving of $7–8 million
over the medium term (see chart). These could
include:



Limiting subsidies to SOEs. Several SOEs
continue to be a large and recurring drain
on the budget, with transfers amounting to
about $14.2 million per year (nearly
15 percent of the overall budget) on
average over FY2007–10. These transfers
take the form of pricing subsidies, capital
contributions, and payments in kind. The
largest recipients are the Marshalls Energy
Company (MEC) and Air Marshall Islands
(AMI). Staff advises against the proposal to
extend a government subsidized loan of
$1.5–$2 million to AMI for operating
expenses and recommends limiting
subsidies to the SOEs and accelerating the
reform. The Cabinet has approved a set of
good practice principles on SOEs to
address governance framework (see
Section B). A comprehensive recovery plan
for the MEC was separately approved, and
early resolution of payment arrears (nearly
$9 million) is imperative to address
recurring cash flow problems and widening
operating losses, which pose significant
fiscal risks.



Reducing allowances. As part of the
expenditure cuts, the government should
adopt the recommendations by the CAP
committee to reduce allowances to public
officials, in areas such as housing and
electricity, thereby saving about $2 million.

Containing public sector payroll. Although
the annual average rise in public wages
during FY2005–11 was modest at
1.4 percent, average public wages remain
around 2½ times higher than comparable
wages in the private sector, and a similar
gap exists between wages in public
enterprises and those in the private sector
(see chart). Building on the efforts to
identify over-staffing and excess pay, staff
recommends limiting public sector payroll
further by eliminating redundant vacant
positions beginning in FY2012, which
could save as much as $1 million. An
AsDB consultant will undertake personnel
audits beginning FY2012 and provide
further assistances in containing the public
payroll.

Along with these expenditure cuts,
swift legislative approval of revenue
reforms is imperative to put public finances
on a sustainable path. The government’s tax
reform plan intends to rectify the drawbacks of
existing tax regime (for example, discourage
capital investment, regressive nature on
personal income tax, and enforcement
difficulties) by replacing the gross revenue tax
and import duties with a net income tax and
a consumption tax. 4 While designed to be
revenue-neutral, the tax reform could generate

additional revenue and support a more progrowth business environment by broadening
the tax base and improving tax administration.
The authorities should look to overcome
remaining public concerns regarding the new
tax rates, and to bring forward the legislative
process as a full package, so as to start
implementing the tax reform within FY2012.
Systematic consultation and public outreach,
including community-based forums, would
help mobilize public support. Further efforts to
strengthen the tax administration, particularly
on identifying unaccounted import duties,
would lead to a fairer tax system and bring in
additional revenue. As domestic prices stabilize
and the economy recovers, temporary tax
exemptions effective since the recession in
FY2008-09 would need to be wound down.
21.
A
sound
public
financial
management would improve the efficiency
of spending. In the face of scheduled declines
in Compact grants, the authorities have begun
to formulate a five-year rolling medium-term
budgeting framework to better allocate public
resources based on previous performance
audit. To enhance the efficiency of spending,
staff would recommend:

23.
The social security system still faces
a sizeable unfunded liability. The Marshall
Islands Social Security Administration (MISSA)
has partially recovered long-time arrears from
local governments, but still faces rising benefit
payouts in excess of contributions (about
$1 million in FY2009 and $1.5 million in
FY2010, see chart).6 The MISSA has liquidated
trust fund assets to finance the shortfall since
FY2010. To restore health to the pension
system over the medium term, the authorities
are considering a transition to a defined
contribution scheme. As the transition would
take time to be put in place, staff recommends
taking interim measures to safeguard the value
of the Social Security Fund, including through

would benefit from enhancing the capacity of

to investigation and performance audits. In
that regard, staff recommends granting the
Auditor General the authority to prosecute
public sector fraud through delegation by the
Attorney General. Staff sees room for further
increasing resources to the Office, possibly by
utilizing the capacity-building grants under the
amended Compact.

According to the latest actuarial report in 2009, the

raising contribution rates, and reviewing the
benefit structure. If contribution rate rose by
1 percentage point and benefit was reduced

60 to 65 could further reduce benefit payouts
by $3.0 million a year.

private wage gap and hindering private
sector employment.


Subsidies to SOEs. The authorities indicated
that pressures to support weak SOEs were
mounting. The large spending cuts had
weakened various public services, making
it difficult to reduce further subsidies to
SOEs. The government has been
addressing the financial problems of SOEs
through AsDB assistance. On the proposed
support to AMI, the Cabinet preferred
granting a low interest government loan to
AMI for regular equipment maintenance,
instead of leaving it to seek a more costly
private loan requiring guarantees.



Reducing allowances. The government
planned to propose a bill to reduce
allowances to public officials, in areas such
as housing and electricity, thereby
gradually limiting the expenses by about
$2 million.

The Authorities’ Views
24.
The government recognizes the
need for fiscal adjustment and is aiming to
achieve a fiscal surplus in FY2012. They note
that progress has been made in building up
the fiscal surpluses. For instance, they
transferred $1.1 million during FY2011 to the
CTF. The authorities are also targeting a further
modest contribution to the CTF in FY2012 by
implementing tax reform and intend to reduce
allowances,
which
are
part
of
the
recommendations by the CAP and the Tax and
Revenue
Reform
and
Modernization
Commission (TRRM). The market value of the
CTF is likely to have declined in recent months,
but the authorities have no plans to switch the
investment strategies based on short-term
market fluctuations.
25.
While agreeing in principle to the
need for expenditure cuts, the authorities
expressed concerns over the broader social
and economic impact of the reductions.


14

Public sector payroll. On public wages, the
authorities noted that the large privatepublic wage gap was primarily driven by
higher expatriate wages at the SOEs. The
authorities also had frozen or reduced
public wages over the past two years,
leaving limited room for further cuts.
Further payroll reductions could reduce
household incomes without a social safety
net, as the private sector is unlikely to
absorb layoffs. Instead, the authorities
preferred starting with eliminating vacant
positions, enforcing mandatory retirement
rules, and reducing gradually excessive
allowances. Staff recognized these risks
and supported a targeted gradual
approach, but noted that those steps came
at a cost by maintaining the large public-

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

26.
On the revenue side, the authorities
plan to gradually implement tax reform
starting in late FY2012 after resolving issues
over tax rates. While the authorities and the
public in general favored tax reform, no
agreement has been reached over the new tax
rates that would be revenue neutral. Against
this background, they intend to:


Put forward tax reform legislation in
January
2012—the
first
Nitijela
(Parliament) session after the general
elections.



Recruit an external consultant with donor
support to determine appropriate tax rates
and ensure a smooth transition.



Implement tax reforms in stages starting in
FY2012 and continue to strengthen tax
administration.

The authorities were keen to
27.
improve public financial management. They
have undertaken a self assessment of their
public financial management system and have
sought technical assistance in modernizing the
Public Finance Management Act to further
streamline the procurement procedures. The
authorities noted that they had scaled up

REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

performance budgeting efforts, but have not
yet fully integrated so far the five-year
medium-term budget framework into the
annual budget process.
28.
The authorities welcomed staff
recommendation on expanding the audit
capacity. An additional $0.15 million was
appropriated to the Office of the General
Auditor in the FY2012 budget. This will
enhance the capacity for conducting
investigation and performance audits, as called
for in the latest report by the Public Accounts
Committee.

29.
The authorities were considering
converting the social security system to
a defined contribution scheme. The Social
Security Reform Commission expected the
funding gap (about $1.5 million in FY2010) to
widen without a change in policy. The
Commission hired an actuarial advisor to
consider options to safeguard the value of the
social security fund. Among the options, the
Commission favored a shift of the existing
defined benefit scheme to a defined
contribution scheme and capping certain
benefits.

B. Private Sector Development and Structural Reforms
Policy Issues and Staff’s Views
30.
A
vibrant
private
sector
is
a prerequisite for sustainable economic
growth and fiscal adjustments. Many private
sector activities depend largely on government
contracts and services provided by inefficient
SOEs. To offset the declines in Compact grants,
the government should look to provide an
enabling environment for private sector
growth. Key obstacles include limited access to
commercial lending, difficulties in securing
land uses, aging infrastructure, and the large
gap between public and private sector wages.
31.
Comprehensive reforms of SOEs are
needed to raise their efficiency. The SOEs
are economically significant with total assets of
$116 million as of end-FY2008 (about
76 percent of GDP), but their financial
performance has been lackluster. Many SOEs
have social service obligations, which are often
not clearly defined, further complicating
resource planning and leading to weak
management and underinvestment. In areas
where SOEs provide purely commercial
services, their operations should be divested or
contracted out (for example, government
ownership in Majuro Resorts, Inc. and AMI).
The authorities are preparing a new SOE
policy, which will form the basis for the
forthcoming SOE Reform Act, but progress is
slow (Box 4). Staff urges the authorities to take

full ownership of the reform and swiftly
approve the new policy.
32.
Recent expansion of commercial
fishery
activities
through
foreign
investment and regional agencies could
help spur private sector development.
Commercial fisheries, a key source of
employment and growth in recent years, have
increasingly
diversified
operations
in
harvesting, processing, transshipment, and
exports. Taking advantage of this momentum,
the government should strengthen the
investment environment, including vessel
support services, and retail and wholesale
areas. In this context, the PNA, in which RMI
participates, will contribute to long-term
growth by fostering the sustainability of fishery
activities through enforcing and exchanging
fishing rights.

Box 4. Marshall Islands: State-Owned Enterprises Reform under the AsDB Program
The RMI government entered into a Public Sector Program loan with the AsDB in September 2010. While
the primary concern was to resolve the immediate financial difficulty in the Marshalls Energy Company, the
program has been designed to support the government in its broader reform initiatives, including fiscal
1
adjustment and SOE performance.
The weak financial position among the SOEs call
for immediate reform. The size of the SOEs in the
economy is significant, with total assets of $116
million as of FY2008 (about 76 percent of GDP).
Long-term financial performance has been poor
with recurring operating losses every year during
2
FY2002–08. The cumulative operating losses were
$42 million (net of government subsidies and debt
forgiveness) and public capital contributions totaled
$39 million, adding to a substantial sum of $81
million (about 53 percent of GDP), about 1.7 times
the average equity. The losses were so severe that
the SOEs sector consumes its own equity every 4.3
years.

1/ Based on FY2010 audited financial statements. Operating losses shown here are before government
and other contributions, and capital injection.

Recognizing the need to reform the SOEs, the
government adopted a comprehensive recovery plan (CRP) for the energy company and six good practice
principles. The CRP is tailored for the energy company to improve its operational and financial performance,
placing it on a more sound commercial footing. The principles aim to strengthen the governance and monitoring
framework for SOEs and address corporate planning and pricing issues. Specifically,
1. Concrete Business Plans. The government and the SOEs will jointly establish and publicly release the
Statements of Corporate Business Plan and performance targets.
2. Essential Services. The SOEs will identify essential activities and all non-essential activities would be sold or
wound down.
3. Boards of Directors. The government ensures qualified and experienced members would serve the Board of
Directors in the SOEs and the directors have independence in operation.
4. Management. The government would ensure senior management have suitable qualifications and
experience.
5. Cost and Pricing. The prices and charges would need to be aligned with the total cost of service, except
where funded by subsidy from government.
6.

Sound Financial Management. The SOEs would need to maintain sound and prudent financial management.

Based on these principles, an SOE policy has been drafted, which will serve as a basis for the new SOE Act.
The implementation of these good practice principles is slow across the SOEs. The Cabinet has not approved the
SOE policy yet, noting the new eligibility of Board directors is too restrictive.
The AsDB also provides technical assistance to selected SOEs as part of the reform. After consultations with
3
stakeholders, three SOEs were selected for reform support in addition to the MEC. The AsDB provides technical
assistance in developing medium-term reform plans to improve the viability and sustainability in terms of financial
and operational performance. The implementation of the reforms plans over 2012 will be critical to improving the
SOEs’ performance.

Authorities’ Views
33.
The authorities, while noting the
business
environment
remained
challenging, planned to take advantage of
ongoing recovery to foster growth. They
agreed that many private activities had been
dependent
on
public
spending
and
unemployment remained high. Structural
impediments on land uses were deep-rooted,
which would take more than political will to
rectify, though measures were in place to
support long-term land lease. To take
advantage of the ongoing recovery, the
authorities
welcomed
recent
private
investment in niche tourism and were
exploring possibilities in expanding the

existing joint venture and intended to foster
vessel support services. The RMI’s participation
in the PNA would further strengthen
commercial fishing activities.
34.
The authorities indicated SOE
reforms are underway with the assistance of
AsDB. With respect to the new SOE policy, the
Cabinet found the conditions regarding new
eligibility of the Board directors to be too
restrictive and required further review before
endorsing the policy to be put into the SOE
Reform Act. Divesting plans were initiated for
Air Marshall Islands and the Majuro Resorts,
Inc. but poor maintenance and lingering land
issues have deterred investors.

C. Financial Sector
Background

Policy Issues and Staff’s Views

35.
The banking system in general
remains liquid and profitable. The banking
sector is primarily financed by deposits, with
about two-thirds of deposits allocated for
lending. Growth in commercial lending has
been constrained by the lack of collateral, high
interest rates, and limited investment
opportunities. Financing conditions have
somewhat tightened in FY2010 as interest rate
margin widened, especially on commercial
credits. Although banks profitability is
reasonable with return on assets at about
5 percent and current nonperforming loans
(NPLs) are low at less than 2 percent of
outstanding loans, profits could decline if
credit risks and NPLs were to rise in the event
of a slowdown as many households are heavily
indebted with short-term consumer loans. The
publicly-owned Marshall Islands Development
Bank (MIDB) is increasingly engaged in shortterm consumer lending, moving away from its
primary mandate of providing credit access for
viable businesses. The MIDB also provides
banks commercial credit guarantees at low
fees.

36.
Strengthening
the
regulatory
framework would contribute to stability in
the financial sector. The Banking Commission
currently has limited authority and autonomy
to undertake appropriate bank supervision
under the Banking Act as its actions could be
appealed to and reverted by the Cabinet. Staff
supports the Banking Commission’s efforts to
revise the Banking Act to strengthen bank
supervision in line with PFTAC assistance and
to enhance the AML/CFT regime, particularly
regarding the offshore company registration
sector. Staff also supports broadening the
Banking Commission’s oversight to include the
MIDB and other nonbank financial institutions
that engage in private lending activities.
37.
Financial policies should aim to
facilitate credit intermediation and support
long-term growth. The lack of commercial
credit has held back new start-ups and viable
business opportunities. The act on secured
transactions for moveable property has
improved access to commercial credit at
reduced cost. Refocusing the MIDB towards
commercial and mortgage lending, rather than

consumer loans, and further streamlining the
land registration process would expand
businesses’ access to much needed capital.
Authorities’ Views
38.
The authorities recognize the heavy
household indebtedness and intend to take
measures to mitigate risks. Consumer
lending represents about 77 percent of private
sector credit and average household debt to
income ratio is high at more than 80 percent.
However, banks considered risk exposures to
be manageable as they granted only shortterm loans and required collaterals, personal
guarantors, and allotment pledges. The
authorities had earlier attempted to limit risk
exposures through administrative directives,
but these actions were later repealed on the
grounds that the Banking Commission was not
following the Banking Act.
39.
The authorities agreed on the need
to strengthen the regulatory framework.
The Banking Commission had worked with
PFTAC in revising the Banking Act to

strengthen bank supervision and AML/CFT
capacity. The revised Act would broaden
Banking
Commission’s
oversight
on
institutions engaging in private lending
activities. The authorities also noted the
process would need closer consultations with
banks and lending institutions in view of
possible impacts on credit supply, particularly
on housing loans.
40.
Besides supporting growth, financial
policies should also meet broader social
objectives. The Development Bank saw itself
as having a broader mandate of assisting
individuals who otherwise would be turned
away by commercial banks. The authorities
viewed high interest rates and lack of
commercial credit as partly reflecting high
credit
risks
and
limited
investment
opportunities. The potential fiscal risk arising
from the credit guarantees on bank loans
through the Development Bank was noted, but
the authorities did not see a need to reduce
the exposures or revise the pricing of such
operations.

D. Other Issues
Staff and Authorities’ Views
41.
The authorities and staff agreed
that
improving
the
coverage
and
timeliness of economic statistics would
better guide policies. The Economic Policy,
Planning and Statistics Office (EPPSO) has

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

taken a number of steps to improve data
collection. The authorities are going to
publish the 2011 Census results in the coming
months to guide policy planning in
demographic
and
socio-economic
developments.

REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

STAFF APPRAISAL
42.
Medium-term growth prospects in
the RMI remain weak given the sluggish
private sector and the scheduled decline in
Compact grants. The recovery is likely to
continue in the near term driven by expanding
fisheries sector and ongoing construction
activities, but risks are on the downside.
Medium-term prospects are constrained by
declines in Compact grants in the absence of
substantial fiscal and structural reforms.
43.
Risks to external stability appear to
be contained. The RMI’s exchange rate
appears to be in line with the medium-term
fundamentals after the significant real
appreciation in FY2008–09 was largely
reversed following the stabilization of
domestic prices. The use of the U.S. dollar as
the domestic currency remains appropriate,
given the small economy size and close ties
with the United States in trade and finance.
44.
Without significant adjustment, the
fiscal situation is likely to worsen. The RMI
has relied heavily on Compact grants to
advance its economic development. While the
fiscal situation has improved in recent years,
the projected value of the CTF is unlikely to
generate sufficient income to supplement the
expiry of Compact grants in FY2023 without
additional contributions. Meanwhile, measures
to address the funding gap of the social
security system should be taken urgently to
ensure inter-generational fairness and to avoid
further erosion of the Social Security Fund
value. It would be important to start
implementing reforms early to create fiscal
space and address possible setbacks. Further
delays in needed reforms would lead to more
costly adjustments in the future.

bringing forward the legislature and resolving
the pending uncertainties on new tax rates,
and implement targeted expenditure cuts on
public sector payroll, subsidies to SOEs, and
excessive allowances. Structural reforms to
develop an enabling environment for private
sector and facilitate foreign direct investment
would enhance long-term growth and
generate higher revenue. In that regard,
expediting the SOE reform with the assistance
of AsDB is a key priority.
46.
Strengthening
the
regulatory
framework would contribute to stability in
the financial sector. High household
indebtedness and the absence of proper
regulatory oversight on the Development Bank
and other private lending institutions are
major risks to the financial system. Efforts to
further strengthen banking supervision by
broadening
the
Banking
Commission’s
supervisory authority would be welcome steps.
Financial policies should aim to facilitate credit
intermediation and support long-term growth.
The secured lending act would facilitate
commercial lending, but further efforts on land
registration are needed to facilitate the use of
land for collateral.
47.
The quality of official statistics,
while adequate for surveillance, has room
for improvement. Data availability has
improved through efforts by the EPPSO, but
the coverage and timeliness of statistics tend
to constrain policy planning and evaluation.
Continued staff training and capacity building
would contribute to improving data quality.
48.
It is recommended that the next
Article IV consultation take place on a
24-month cycle.

45.
Securing
fiscal
sustainability
requires tangible progress in fiscal and
structural reforms. Fiscal reforms should aim
to swiftly implement the tax reform by

Figure 2. Marshall Islands: Economic Developments and Outlook
The economy grew by 5.2 percent in FY2010 after two
consecutive years of contraction, mainly driven by an
expansion of fisheries sector and recovery of external
demand.

The current account deficit remains sizeable due to an
expansion in the fishery sector and construction projects
largely funded by FDI and foreign grants.

2/ The significant rise of imports between FY2010 and FY2013 reflects the purchase of new purse seiners mainly financed by foreign direct investment (FDI).
3/ A Land Use Agreement was reached between the RMI government and Kwajalein landowners in May 2011, authorizing $32 million held in escrow to be disbursed from
the U.S. government to the landowners. Most amount will eventually be transferred out from RMI as many landowners reside abroad.
4/ Compact funding pertaining to the Kwajalein Atoll Trust Fund and Kwajalein resident and landowner compensation payments are classified as income rather than
official transfers. Trust Fund contributions by the U.S. and Taiwan, Province of China, are regarded as capital transfers.
5/ Official transfers include current transfers but excludes capital transfers and Trust Fund contributions.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

ANNEX II. RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
GROUP
1.
The Bank team led by Mr. Suri and the
Fund team led by Mr. Yoshida maintain a close
working relationship and have an ongoing
dialogue on macroeconomic and structural
issues.
2.
The teams agreed that the RMI’s main
macroeconomic challenges are to achieve
(i) long-term budgetary self-reliance and
(ii) facilitating a greater role for the private
sector in delivering services and generating
employment.
3.
Based on this shared assessment, the
teams identified several reform areas as
critical in view of their central role in achieving
fiscal consolidation and fostering sustained
growth:
 Civil service reform. The public sector
wage bill is similar to that in other small
Pacific Island Countries, but large by
international standards of economies of
comparable scale, and unsustainable in light
of declining US Compact grants. Reducing the
public wage bill to sustainable levels and
reducing labor market inefficiencies will likely
require a reduction of the civil servant
workforce and in pay to bring compensation
in line with private sector services costs. Such
reforms would, however, need to be cognizant
of the constraints imposed on employment
opportunities by the small size of the
economy and the current limited potential for
private sector growth.
 Reform of the revenue system. The
existing tax system lacks the ability to raise
needed additional revenue, discourages
private investment, and is inequitable. Raising
additional revenue while supporting private
sector growth requires implementation of

a comprehensive tax reform program and
strengthening tax administration.
 Public sector enterprise reform. Many
state-owned enterprises (SOE) are a drain on
the public finance and provide unreliable or
costly services undermining private sector
development. To improve their performance,
reforms are needed to strengthen efficiency,
better delineate commercial and noncommercial services, and introduce tariff
systems that better reflect cost of services. In
areas where SOEs provide purely commercial
services, divestment should be considered.
 Structural
reforms
in
the
telecommunication and energy sectors. An
improved regulatory environment and private
investment in telecommunications is required
to facilitate broader access to and reduce the
costs of delivering social services and create
opportunities for private sector development.
An improved regulatory and tax framework in
the energy sector is required to i) alleviate
existing excessive petroleum price margins
which increase living costs and impede private
sector growth, ii) ensure security of supply,
and iii) generate higher government revenues.
 Improved
aid
management
and
coordination. Existing donor flows are poorly
coordinated and reporting arrangements are
inadequate. This leads to inefficiency in public
service delivery and weakens macroeconomic
management. Aid-reporting systems should
be improved to ensure strengthened
coordination and better information on donor
expenditure.
4.
The
teams
agreed
on
close
cooperation going forward. The below table

ANNEX III. RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK
Prepared based on input from the AsDB staff.
The country strategy of the Asian
Development Bank (AsDB) for the Republic of
the Marshall Islands (RMI) is set out in AsDB’s
“Pacific Approach 2010–14” and the “Country
Operations Business Plan 2012–14”. The
Country Operations Business Plan has four
areas of strategic focus: (i) macroeconomic
and fiscal management, (ii) private sector
development,
(iii) human
capacity
development, and (iv) environment and
climate change. The operational focus of AsDB
over 2012–14 is on supporting the
government’s
efforts
to
restore
macroeconomic stability after the global
financial crisis and achieve long-term fiscal
sustainability. AsDB is proposing an indicative
lending program of $5 million over 2012–14
to support the implementation of the
government’s reform initiatives and the
adjustments required to achieve fiscal
sustainability. Technical assistance (TA) of
$725,000 is proposed for 2012 and 2013 for
strengthening economic policy and planning
and enhancing public sector service delivery.
AsDB’s program in the RMI is also supported
using regional TA and grants.
Since joining the AsDB in April 1990, the RMI
has received 13 loans totaling $87.63 million.
AsDB loans have covered education, fisheries,
health, water, and transport sectors, and
support for public sector reform and structural
adjustment (see table). One loan assisted
emergency typhoon rehabilitation. From 2003
to 2009, AsDB’s program for the RMI focused
on TA rather than loans. Lending resumed in
2010 with the approval of a program loan for
$9.5 million to support public sector reform.
As of end December 2010 TA grants totaling
$19.58 million for 48 TA projects had been
approved. These comprised both project

preparatory and advisory TA. The TA program
has covered a wide range of sectors and
issues from support to AsDB loans to building
capacities in development banking, tourism
management,
environmental
protection,
economic policy formulation, as well as in
developing the private sector and reforming
the civil service.
In July 2010, a $1.76 million grant was
approved for improving energy supply for
poor households. The grant is (i) supporting
the installation of prepayment meters for
Marshalls Energy Company (MEC) customers
to reduce household expenditure on
electricity
and
improve
household
management of utility bills, (ii) connecting
unserviced poor households and improving
power supply to poor areas in Majuro, Wotje,
and Jaluit, (iii) and trialing of a coconut oil–
diesel blend as alternative fuel in the MEC
power generators to earn additional income
for poor producers of copra in outer atolls.
In August 2010, a $3 million regional grant
was approved for social protection of the
vulnerable in the Cook Islands, the RMI and
Tonga. Approximately $1.2 million of the grant
is allocated to the RMI, largely for providing
direct support to the vulnerable for coconut
tree planting and enhancing government
capacity to identify the vulnerable population.
Over 2010 the AsDB provided support for
public sector reform initiatives by deploying
technical experts to address human resource,
energy, and public finance matters. This
support resulted in the approval of the
$9.5 million program loan referred to above –
the majority of which was used to repay a loan
held by the MEC with the Bank of Guam which

improved cash flow and released funds for
generator refurbishment. Accompanying the
loan was $900,000 of TA to continue to
support the RMI’s reform efforts over 2011
and 2012. Technical experts are currently

providing support on state-owned enterprise
reform, budget preparation and monitoring,
debt management, and human resources
reform.

ANNEX IV. RELATIONS WITH THE PACIFIC FINANCIAL
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTRE
The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance
Centre (PFTAC)’s1 assistance to the RMI during
the past years has focused on financial
supervision, public expenditure management,
and tax administration policy through
numerous missions, regional seminars and
workshops which RMI officials attended.
PFTAC also organized one secondment for a
staff of member countries to banking
supervision agency of a non-member country.
Public Financial Management
In the past years PFM activity in RMI has
increased
significantly.
A
peripatetic
consultant was fielded by PFTAC to work on
fiscal forecasting and again in June 2008 for
one final visit to anchor the system and
provide training. A cash management manual
was developed by PFTAC and training
provided on its operation in early 2007. A
peripatetic consultant has since provided
training on the operation of the system to line
ministries and visited RMI in January 2008,
along with the PFTAC advisor, to provide
further training and to review the system. The
PFTAC advisor visited RMI again in May 2009
to provide training. PFTAC is meanwhile
developing a commitment control manual for
RMI and a commitment control system may

of
the
draft
commitment control manual is received.
PFTAC also carried out an assessment of the
IFMIS systems in RMI in December 2009 with
a view to recommend next steps to improve
the operation of the system.
Tax Administration and Policy

In 2008, the Minister of Finance set up the Tax
and Revenue Reform and Modernization
Commission
(TRRM)
to
make
recommendations to reform the revenue
collection system and to strengthen the
capabilities and effectiveness of the Division
of Revenue and Taxation (DRT). The TRRM
reported back in 2010 and recommended
a comprehensive revenue reform to introduce
an income tax and domestic sales tax.
Subsequent PFTAC advice highlighted revenue
leakage in the sales tax proposal and the
recommendation was changed to introduce a
VAT. Since then PFTAC has provided
assistance to develop a high level
implementation plan for the revenue reforms
(2010); draft legislation for the income tax,
VAT and excise taxes and revenue
administration activities (2010–11); and draft a
terms of reference for the recruitment of
a long term consultant who will assume the
role of Assistant Secretary of the duration for
the reforms (2011). PFTAC is currently
assisting with recruitment of the Assistant
Secretary. Once the Assistant Secretary is
recruited (1st quarter of 2012) PFTAC has
undertaken to provide assistance to develop
an information technology strategic plan for
both tax and customs and will continue to
provide support and advice to the Assistant
Secretary.

Financial Sector Regulation and
Supervision
At the request of the Commissioner, the
Advisor visited the Commission in July 2008.
The focus of the mission was to strengthen
the capacity of the authorities to conduct offsite surveillance of banks with a number of
revisions recommended to the prudential
reporting requirements for banks and
expansion of the off-site monitoring database.
The mission also included training in the
analysis of financial statements to assess a
borrower’s credit risk.
A follow-up visit to with the Commission was
conducted in January 2010 to provide training
and support to Commission staff in
conducting an on-site CAMELS-focused bank
examination. The visit included providing
hands-on training and support to Commission
staff in assessing credit risk in the bank’s loan
portfolio through the use of financial
statement
analysis,
reviewing
the
appropriateness of loan repayment structures
and repayment histories, and assessing the
adequacy of collateral. The visit also resulted
in the development of a standardized
examination report to assist the Commission
in presenting examination findings and
recommendations. At the request of the
Commission, a draft regulation to clarify and
ensure the proper calculation of the single
borrower limit as provided in Section 130(1)(a)
of the Banking Act was also prepared during
this visit.
In February 2011 training and support was
provided to Commission staff in conducting a
follow-up examination to assess efforts by a
bank to correct weaknesses and concerns
noted as a result of an earlier examination. As
a result of the follow-up visit, assistance was
provided to the Commission in drafting an
appropriate regulatory response to the
examination findings. Future visits with the
Commission will include expanding and

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

revising on-site examination procedures to
allow for risk-focused procedures in order to
improve examination efficiencies.
Economic and Financial Statistics
The Economic Policy, Planning and Statistics
Office (EPPSO) received significant training
since 2005 on balance of payments and
national accounts statistics, including through
participation on a PFTAC regional national
accounts statistics course conducted in
Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia in
2006. Despite the extensive training, these
statistics continued to be compiled by external
consultants. The previous PFTAC Statistics
Advisor
provided
some
technical
backstopping to the national accounts
consultant, and in July 2007 visited RMI to
assist with the improvement and compilation
of their Balance of Payments (BOP) statistics.
The mission was carried out in conjunction
with the two consultants who are funded by
the U.S. Department of Interior to update the
Annual Compact Report.
In November 2008, the current PFTAC Advisor
undertook a joint BOP and national accounts
statistics mission to RMI to continue
development work on BOP and NA sources
and methods, as well as to assist in updating
BOP and NA estimates. The EPPSO
counterpart left in early 2009 and there is
currently no statistics staff at EPPSO. As
a result, two consultants funded by the U.S.
Department of Interior visit RMI annually to
update the BOP and national accounts
statistics for inclusion in the Annual Compact
Report.

Economic Policy, Planning and Statistics Office (EPPSO) was established in February 2003 and took efforts in
building local capacity to collect and disseminate economic and social statistics. Through the close
collaboration of EPPSO and various ministries, an external consultant team in the Pacific Islands Training
Initiative (www.pitiviti.org), funded by the U.S. Department of Interior, prepares a comprehensive set of
annual statistics covering key areas beginning FY2008. Previously, extensive Fund technical assistance was
provided through the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center (PFTAC) in preparation of the balance of
payments and national account statistics. Data shortcomings include the coverage and timeliness of data
releases.
National Accounts: National income accounts from (the latest data through FY2010) have been prepared by
the external consultants dating back to FY1997. Some shortcomings remain, for instance, investment and
savings indicators are not available. The national census was conducted in early 2011 and final results are
under preparation with the assistance of the South Pacific Commission.
Employment: Data on employment and wages are available and classified by sectors based on the filings to
Social Security Administration. However, no unemployment data are available.
Price statistics: The new consumer price index (CPI), rebased in 2003Q1, replaced the previous CPI
developed in the 1980s. The updated CPI is based on the information from the Household Income and
Expenditure Survey 2002, conducted with assistance from the U.S. Department of the Interior and the U.S.
Census Bureau.
Government finance: Fiscal data are regularly compiled for budget control, and with the help of the
consultants they are consolidated into a format suitable for analysis. Annual financial audits on the central
government and component units were published. The RMI does not present fiscal data using Government
Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) format.
Monetary statistics: A reporting system has been established for domestic banking institutions on the basis
of monthly reporting forms and guidelines developed by the 1993 STA mission. Even though data are
reported by banks to the Banking Commissioner, they are not published or reported to the Fund. Tables on
basic balance sheet items as well as income and expenses are prepared for inclusion in the Annual Compact
Report.
Balance of payments: Through the collaboration with the EPPSO, the external consultants provide annual
update on the balance of payment statistics. Without mandatory reporting, statistics on exports and imports
are incomplete. Limited data are available on services, factor income, and private transfers, hindering analysis
of external sector developments.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
the Republic of the Marshall Islands
On November 23, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI). 1
Background
The RMI’s economy is highly dependent on external aid, and the private sector growth is
sluggish. A renewed Compact of Free Association agreement (“Compact”) with the
United States provides a stream of stable, but declining grants aimed primarily at
education, health, and infrastructure sectors. These grants have been a boon to social
and economic growth, but have come at the expense of fostering economic dependence
on foreign income. The economy is dominated by a large public sector and private
businesses contribute little to growth. The banking sector is small.
Following a severe recession in FY2008-09, the economy grew by 5.2 percent in
FY2010, driven by an expansion of fishery output and exports, and moderating fuel
prices. Inflation increased following the significant rise in commodity prices in early
2011, but is projected to moderate gradually.
The overall fiscal balance improved in FY2010 along with the economic recovery, but
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm

mostly as a result of unspent earmarked appropriations. Only a modest surplus of
$0.4 million was recorded in the general fund for discretionary uses in FY2010. The
overall surplus in FY2011 is estimated to be modest; with a 5.5 percent across-theboard cut of current expenditures and additional revenues from fishing fees partly offset
by temporary tax exemptions on food and other basis consumables and increased
subsidies to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to cover operating losses. Despite
a potential upside of higher fisheries revenue, the fiscal outlook will continue to be
hindered by weak financial positions in the SOEs and limited budget planning. Over the
medium term, fiscal balance is expected to be modest at about 1 percent of GDP.
The deterioration in the current account is expected to continue until FY2013 due to
temporary factors. The widening of the deficit since FY2009 reflects increased imports
under the Kwajalein land use agreements, new investments in the fisheries sector and
the airport extension project, which have been financed mainly through foreign direct
investment and capital grants. Once these temporary factors expire, the current account
deficit beyond FY2013 is expected to decline to around 5 percent of GDP. Though
external debt is relatively high at about $117 million as of end-FY2011, it is mainly on
concessional terms and is expected to decline.
The recovery is likely to continue in the near term, but growth over the medium term is
expected to stay low at around 1½ percent with the growth in fisheries sector partly
offset by the decline in Compact grants. The economy could face stiff headwinds if the
global slowdown proves severe and prolonged. Long-term risks include continued
outward migration and shore erosion on local atolls from climate change.
The global financial crisis has made it more difficult to achieve long-term budgetary selfreliance and sustained growth. Under current policies, the buildup in government assets
in the Compact Trust Fund is projected to fall short of replacing Compact grants expiring
in FY2023. Closing the revenue gap would require a substantial fiscal adjustment over
the medium term.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the economic recovery and the positive near-term
outlook. However, they noted that the medium-term prospects remain weak and, like
other island economies with limited natural resources and remote location, the Marshall
Islands is highly vulnerable to external shocks. The key challenges are to strengthen
medium- and long-term growth prospects, and to secure a sustainable fiscal position
without compromising priority social and infrastructure spending as Compact grants are
phased out.
Directors agreed that fiscal sustainability calls for sustained efforts to achieve higher
budgetary savings and a faster build-up of assets in the Compact Trust Fund over the
medium term. To this end, they urged swift implementation of fiscal and structural

3
reforms to boost fiscal revenue and contain public spending. Key measures will include
the implementation of tax reform, the containment of the public sector payroll, a
reduction of subsidies to state-owned enterprises and allowances to public officials, and
improvements in public financial management. Putting the social security system on a
sounder financial footing will also be important.
Directors considered that the planned reforms of state-owned enterprises are essential
to both fiscal adjustment and the development of the private sector. They encouraged
the authorities to complement these reforms with further steps to improve the business
environment, including a streamlined land registration process.
Directors took note that the banking sector is liquid, well-capitalized, and profitable.
Nevertheless, they considered the high level of household indebtedness a financial risk
that could be exacerbated by the development bank’s shift toward short-term consumer
lending. In this context, Directors supported steps to broaden regulatory oversight,
including as regards the regime against money laundering and terrorism financing, and
to facilitate credit to businesses.

Statement by Christopher Legg, Executive Director for the Republic of the Marshall
Islands, and Messrs. Craig Fookes and Mack Kaminaga, Advisors to the Executive
Director
November 23, 2011
The Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) wishes to express appreciation to the mission
team for their constructive engagement and concise report. With this in mind, the authorities
agree with the substance of the report, which correctly identifies the size of the fiscal
challenges, highlights the need for growth in the private sector, and emphasizes the need for
a gradual transition towards self sustainability as aid flows under the Compact scheme come
to an end in 2023.
The economic outlook
The economy has recovered strongly with growth of 5.2% in 2010 following strong growth
in fisheries and a moderate recovery in exports (mainly coconut oil and tourism). Much of
this growth has been concentrated in a small number of sectors and, as a result, there has
been rising unemployment and financial hardship on many of the outer islands. Looking
forward, the authorities are more optimistic than staff about growth over the short-term.
Forecast growth of 9% and 8.8 % in 2011 and 2012 respectively is expected to be driven by a
continued expansion in fisheries.
A slight fall in petrol prices has allowed the current account to narrow. A spike in imports
following the renewed US lease on Kwajalein military base led to a peak in the current
account, although the balance should moderate to 5% through 2013 as temporary factors start
to unwind. While foreign debt is high at about two thirds of GDP, much of this is covered by
concessionary loans. But, over the medium term, active steps will need to be taken to secure
additional export revenue to cover the cost of imports.
While the outlook is positive for 2012, there are growing risks to the forecasts. Risk remains
weighted to the downside as any slowdown in the US or Asia would affect exports. On the
other hand, stronger global growth or an increase in the cost of petrol would have an impact
on the fiscal position and flow through to domestic inflation. While, as the staff note, the use
of the US dollar continues to be appropriate, a fixed exchange rate and lack of independent
monetary policy will continue to place a significant strain on the stabilization role of fiscal
policy. Despite this, the authorities remain optimistic that recent reforms, such as a decision
to allow electricity tariffs to float in line with world oil prices, will put them in a better place
to absorb shocks, should the situation deteriorate.
Fiscal sustainability
Having gained political independence in 1979, the RMI continues to grapple with challenges
associated with gaining economic and fiscal self sufficiency. These challenges include:
geographic isolation; limited economies of scale associated with a population of only 60,000;
and the persistent threat of natural disaster, given the high point on most islands is a little

2
over six meters. The authorities continue to appreciate the support provided by the United
States through the provision of a range of essential services, grants made through the
Compact of Free Association, and via employment income for the 20,000 Marshallese
citizens currently living and working in the United States.
With the Compact due to expire in 2023, the authorities are well aware that fiscal self
sufficiency must remain an overriding goal. Given the Compact currently accounts for over
51.1% of government revenue, the authorities have set up, and continue to make
contributions to, a Compact Trust Fund (CTF), which will provide a stream of income
beyond 2023. The authorities contributed $1.1 million to the CTF in 2011 bringing the
current balance to $142 million (86% of GDP). Strong forecast growth (8.8 in 2012 should
allow a transfer of a similar size next year.
Despite efforts to the contrary, the financial crisis and sluggish global recovery have weighed
on the CTF returns and, as a result, a projected budget shortfall could occur in 2023.
Achieving and maintaining the necessary 5% surplus through 2023 (as staff calculations
suggest) presents an enormous task. It is worth emphasizing that the RMI has no social safety
net and growth in employment in the private sector has remained muted. Thus, while the
authorities’ would prefer a stronger response along the lines suggested by staff, they remain
cognizant of the potential for severe distributional consequences.
Despite these concerns, the authorities have still taken immediate steps to strengthen the
fiscal position. Over the last two years, the RMI has frozen public sector wages and cut
current expenditures by over ten percent. Immediate steps have also been taken to improve
tax collection, but the current tax structure is now considered to be largely outdated.
Exploratory work has started to build consensus for reform as employment growth in the
private sector will require revenue to be raised in a way that does not unduly weigh on
growth. As a result, a full review of the tax system is scheduled for 2012 and the authorities
expect to retain the services of a consultant to help with the design of an appropriate tax
structure.
Public financial management has also been identified as a weakness and the authorities have
sought technical assistance on a review of the Public Finance Management Act. A key goal
is to improve allocation of resources by increasing the focus placed on how the budget will
evolve over the medium term. Work to improve the fiscal position over the medium term has
been supported by a policy of gradual attrition that will act to reduce the public sector
headcount over time. The authorities are also investigating ways to better manage the large
unfunded pension liability.
Structural reform agenda
Growth in the private sector will need to be part of the solution if the RMI is to strengthen its
public finances without undue social cost. The fishing industry stands out as a recent success
story, providing a potential source of employment growth over the near term. The Nauru
Agreement has clarified property rights across the western Pacific by bringing nearly
4.5 million square kilometers of ocean under management. License fees are expected to grow

3
as the agreement manages between 25-30 percent of the global tuna supply. More effective
management and a strong focus on sustainability will also ensure that the fishery resource is
able to generate an ongoing stream of revenue.
Closer to home, the authorities aim to lift domestic investment. A large proportion of private
sector activity relies on public spending and government contracts. With this in mind, the
authorities are looking to divest assets and are also taking steps to improve the operation of
key SOEs. The ADB has provided advice on the new SOE Act, which will clarify SOE
mandates based on clear commercial principles. Legislation has already been drafted and is
expected to pass once comments from the RMI Cabinet have been taken into account. The
authorities have also attempted to divest Air Marshall Islands and the Majuro resorts.
Domestic investment could benefit from steps to reduce administrative delays, transaction
costs, and general investment uncertainty. Work is underway to streamline barriers to private
sector investment, but success will ultimately require a difficult process of institutional
reform and work to overhaul and modernize traditional legal frameworks. Most notably, the
authorities have signaled resolve to address the uncertainty created by the traditional
Marshallese land tenure system. Uncertainty about use of land, given its de facto use as a
shared asset, has complicated investment in fixed plant and equipment. The issues are
complex. However, recent progress has been made to provide a legal basis for long-term land
leases.
Financial sector
The financial sector has remained focused on consumer lending and has contributed little to
overall economic growth. While the sector has remained profitable, much of the rapid growth
in credit has been in consumer loans. The authorities are monitoring high levels of household
debt and intend to begin work on strengthening the regulatory framework. With this goal in
mind, the domestic banks will be consulted early next year on proposed revisions to the
Banking Act. The second priority is to increase the flow of credit to businesses. A lack of
collateral has limited lending into this sector. However, it is hoped that legislation passed on
secured lending and changes to property law will facilitate increased business lending,
perhaps through the use of land as collateral.
