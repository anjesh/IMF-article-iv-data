IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with Former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia
On November 9, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,
and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal without a meeting on a lapse of time basis.2
The economy has been growing at a solid pace on the back of strong domestic demand and
exports with real GDP now 16 percent above its pre-crisis level. In 2015, GDP growth picked
up to 3.8 percent from 3.6 percent in 2014. In 2016H2, growth slowed to 2.2 percent due to
investment contraction and weaker credit growth reflecting political uncertainties.
Unemployment rate continues to decline. Headline inflation has hovered around zero for the
last two years while core inflation turned positive at end-2015. Reflecting exports from the
technological and investment zones (TIDZ) and lower oil prices, the trade deficit has
narrowed in recent years.
Overall fiscal deficit improved in 2015 to 3½ percent of GDP from 4.2 percent in 2014.
Higher profit tax revenues, including one-off collections, and under-execution of capital
spending helped achieve the fiscal consolidation. Large under-execution of capital spending
continued in 2016H1. The government adopted two supplementary budgets during
July-August which together raised the 2016 overall fiscal deficit target to 4 percent of GDP
compared to 3.2 percent in the original budget. Public debt is projected to reach almost 48
percent of GDP in 2016.
Credit growth remains robust particularly to households. Some slowdown was experienced
reflecting both policy measures and political uncertainties. In May, the NBRM increased the
policy rate by 75 bps to 4 percent, and took macro-prudential measures to stem deposit
outflow and euroization pressures. These policies combined with FX interventions

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

successfully stabilized the exchange rate, although lost household deposits have not fully
returned to the system. Lending rates continued to decline despite increase in the policy rate.
The official reserve coverage has improved due to the recent issuance of external sovereign
bond, and is projected to strengthen further over the medium term on the back of improving
trade balances, strong FDI and other financial inflows.
Executive Board Assessment
The economy has endured a number of shocks in the last two years, including a prolonged
political crisis. Growth has so far shown resilience benefiting from accommodative policies,
low commodity prices, sustained foreign investment and improving labor market conditions.
However, the prolonged domestic political crisis is beginning to take a toll on confidence and
the country’s EU accession prospects.
GDP growth is projected to soften in 2016 but pick up in the medium term contingent on
return of political stability. Assuming elections in December followed by stability, growth is
expected to pick up to 3.2 percent in 2017 and further in the medium term benefiting from
infrastructure and foreign direct investment, continued improvement in labor market and
some strengthening of credit growth. In addition to political uncertainties, the outlook faces a
number of other downside risks, notably a slowdown in external demand and renewed
financial turmoil in Greece.
Fiscal policy space has largely been depleted amidst rising risks. The fast rise in debt since
2008 is mostly due to rising primary deficits which, in turn, reflect a combination of low tax
rates and low collection efficiency on the revenue side, and inefficiencies in social spending
and subsidies on the expenditure side. For 2016, staff projects a widening in the overall fiscal
deficit to 4 percent of GDP. In the medium term, without measures, overall fiscal deficit is
projected to stay around 3½ percent of GDP with public debt reaching almost 55 percent of
GDP. Meanwhile, rising borrowing costs, high fiscal financing needs and recent sovereign
downgrading by Fitch have raised near-term fiscal risks. Public finances also face long-term
challenges from population ageing.
Fiscal consolidation should start without delay. To counter risks and create fiscal policy
space, consolidation should start now to stabilize public debt-to-GDP ratio below 50 percent.
For 2016, given caretaker government and little time left in the year, a small consolidation of
0.4 percent of GDP is recommended relying on scaling back of goods and services spending
and collection of VAT arrears. For 2017–18, a consolidation of 1¼ percent of GDP in the
cyclically-adjusted structural primary balance is recommended.
Medium-term fiscal consolidation should rely on high-quality measures. In the last two years,
improvement in the cyclically-adjusted fiscal balance has mostly relied on under-execution
of capital spending. To produce durable results and enhance confidence, particularly in light
of the authorities’ intention to introduce a fiscal rule, consolidation should be based on

3
durable measures. On the revenue side, this entails raising collections, particularly that of
VAT, by strengthening coverage, targeting compliance risks, improving the operation of
large tax payer office, and establishing a Risk Management Unit. On the expenditure side, a
reduction of subsidies and transfers together with greater efficiency in health and education
spending would yield the required savings.
Ensuring sustainability of the pension system is an important medium-term goal. Despite
earlier parametric reforms and introduction of a multi-pillar system, the PAYG (pay-as-yougo) system faces significant financial imbalances due to population ageing and cuts in the
contribution rate. The pension deficit, which is sizable at 4½ percent of GDP, is projected to
more than double by 2030 without further reforms. To ensure sustainability, the authorities
are encouraged to consider raising statutory retirement age given the sizable gap with the EU
average, revising indexation to mostly link to the CPI in line with many countries in the EU,
implementing policies to increase labor force participation, and increasing contribution rates.
Current monetary policy stance is appropriate. Historically low interest rates have helped
sustain robust private sector credit growth and domestic demand without jeopardizing
external stability. Given still-negative output gap, low core inflation and moderate real
exchange rate undervaluation, low policy rate is appropriate. However, in case of pressures
on the exchange rate or risks of deposit outflows, the monetary policy stance may need to be
tightened by raising the policy rate along with stricter macro-prudential policies. Official
reserves are deemed adequate and projected to improve in the medium term on the back of
strong exports, continued FDI and other financial inflows.
Continued vigilance is required for an otherwise healthy and profitable banking sector. Banks
are well-capitalized and profitable. Structural liquidity in the banking system is ample and,
according to NBRM’s latest stress tests, provides strong buffers to withstand severe deposit
outflow shocks. Macro prudential policies have been successful in maintaining banking
system stability through recent episodes of deposit and exchange rate pressures. Continued
vigilance is needed to preserve this record.
Efforts to reduce high structural unemployment should continue. Benefitting from active
labor market policies and broad-based growth, overall unemployment rate has declined by
10 percentage points since 2008. However, at 24 percent, unemployment is still high and
mostly structural reflecting a shortage of skilled labor. Active labor market policies targeting
on-the-job training are bearing fruit and should be continued mindful of fiscal costs.
Policies to attract FDI have contributed to net exports and growth. Competitive wages,
reduced regulations and financial benefits have attracted sizable FDI in recent years. While
these flows have contributed to investment and exports, spillover into domestic economy is
considered limited. To ensure broad-based benefits and sustainability of the FDI-led growth
strategy, complementary reforms to remove impediments faced by the domestic private

4
sector, such as constrained access to finance and unpredictability of business environment,
are recommended.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
October 26, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context: The post-crisis economic recovery has been solid and broad-based due to
accommodative policies, low commodity prices and large infrastructure and foreign
investment. However, a prolonged period of domestic political uncertainties is beginning to
impact confidence and the country’s EU accession prospects. Growth should pick up in the
medium term contingent on the return of political stability following parliamentary elections
in December.
Key policy recommendations
Fiscal Policy. A rapid rise in public debt since 2008 has largely depleted fiscal policy space. To
restore confidence and create policy space, fiscal consolidation should start without delay to
stem the rise in borrowing costs and contain public debt below 50 percent of GDP in the
medium term. Consolidation should rely on high-quality measures such as improving tax
efficiency and rationalization of social spending rather than under-execution of public
investment. A broader set of policy measures, encompassing the labor market and pensions,
are required to rein in the large pension deficit set to worsen in the long run due to
population ageing.
Monetary and Financial Policy. The low policy rate is appropriate in light of deflation, the
still-negative output gap and external stability. However, significant downside risks call for
maintaining strengthened surveillance over a healthy and profitable banking system. The
financial sector has withstood two deposit runs in the last eighteen months thanks to the
authorities’ swift and strong policy actions. A tightening of the monetary policy stance
through higher policy rates and targeted macro-prudential measures may be needed if
deposit outflows and currency conversion pressures resurface.
Structural Policy. Active labor market policies have helped reduce unemployment and should
be continued mindful of fiscal costs. Priorities are to upgrade labor skills to address high
structural unemployment. Tackling systemic weaknesses in governance, the judiciary and
public administration has become critical not only to end the ongoing political crisis but also
to improve the business environment and ensure greater integration with the European
Union.

CONTEXT
1.
The economy has endured a deep and prolonged political crisis. The crisis started in
January 2015 with the main opposition party (SDSM-social democrat) releasing tape recordings
implicating state officials of the ruling coalition (led by VMRO-DPMNE-nationalist) in vote rigging
and large-scale government abuse of power. It subsequently led to the resignation of the Prime
Minister and gave way to an interim technical government. Despite active mediation from the
European Union (EU) and the U.S., parliamentary elections are yet to take place. On July 20, 2016, the
four main political parties signed a new agreement on steps to promote the rule of law, ensure
media freedom, and clean up the voter list with parliamentary elections set for December 11. While
this agreement removes the long political impasse, there are lingering risks of further postponement
of elections and post-election instability.
2.
The crisis has begun to affect
confidence and prospects. The banking
sector has seen a drastic slowdown in deposit
growth. FDI inflows have also moderated.
Meanwhile, in November 2015, nine years after
granting the candidate status, the EU decided
to keep the recommendation conditional on
progress on political and governance fronts. A
failure to make meaningful progress in these
areas is likely to negatively affect FYR
Macedonia’s EU accession aspirations and dent
FDI inflows, much of which are sourced from
EU countries.

estimated to have nearly halved FYR
Macedonia’s potential output growth in post-crisis years. High structural unemployment, low labor
force participation and an ageing population cast a lasting shadow on the longer-term economic
outlook. As policy support and stimulus from infrastructure investment taper off, growth may lose
steam unless reforms to improve productivity and labor’s contribution are put in place.

Box 1. Estimates of Potential Output Growth
Various model-based estimates show that FYR Macedonia’s potential output growth has
decelerated after the global financial crisis. Potential output growth, measured by the three
filter-based approaches, averaged at 2.3 percent during 2009–12 compared to 4.3 percent during
2004–8.1 The estimates are very similar across different methodologies although the production
function approach tends to produce a somewhat lower growth after 2011.

Text Box. Relations with the Fund and Past Policy Advice
A two-year Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL) was approved on January 19, 2011. In March 2011,
the authorities drew 286 percent of quota (about US$ 305 million). Following the expiration of the PLL
in January 2013, the authorities engaged in post-program monitoring which terminated in January
2015. All outstanding Fund credit (about US$174 million) was repaid in advance in February 2015. The
Fund decided to not renew the resident representative position in Skopje after the term of the last
representative ended in August 2016 but kept the local office open. In the absence of an IMF program,
a larger field presence has proved less necessary.
The authorities’ course of action in the areas of fiscal policy and public finance management have not
always been aligned with the IMF recommendations in recent years. The authorities are yet to
implement key recommendations of the last two Article IV consultations: adopt a fiscal policy anchored
in a medium-term strategy to ensure stabilization of public debt, improve budget planning and
medium-term budgetary framework, and adopt durable revenue and expenditure measures to support
fiscal consolidation. Since the last Article IV, the engagement with the tax administration has been
constructive. In the area of monetary and financial policies, implementation has been in line with IMF
recommendations.

activity has been resilient (Figure 1). In
August, FYR Macedonia also experienced strong floods affecting municipalities around Skopje and
Tetovo. Despite initial fears, preliminary assessments by the World Bank suggest limited economic
impact from the floods. Headline inflation has remained around zero for more than two years
reflecting low imported food and energy prices. This has helped support private consumption and
reduce the trade deficit (Figure 1). Core inflation has been positive since end-2015.

Large under-execution of capital spending helped contain the fiscal deficit in 2015 and
2016H1. The cyclically-adjusted primary fiscal deficit, excluding one-off profit tax collections1,
improved to 2.6 percent of GDP from 3.1 percent in 2014 mostly on account of under-execution of
capital spending (Table 2). During 2016H1, capital expenditure was about 24 percent of the amount
originally budgeted. However, the government adopted two supplementary budgets during
July-August which together raised the overall fiscal deficit target to 4 percent of GDP compared to
3.2 percent in the original budget. Relative to the original budget, these two budget revisions
incorporate higher current spending of 0.7 percent of GDP (0.4 percent of GDP budgeted for flood
victims) and lower revenues (0.5 percent of GDP), which are partly countered by lower capital
spending (0.5 percent of GDP). The authorities issued a 7-year eurobond of €450 million in July at
5.6 percent yield.
6.
External stability has been supported by an improving trade balance and sizable
private transfers. The trade deficit has narrowed in recent years benefiting from a better oil trade
balance and exports from the technological and investment zones (TIDZ) (Table 3, Figure 3).
Developments in 2016H1 show strong export growth led by machinery, transport and chemical
products, but a widening of the current account deficit reflecting lower secondary income. The real
effective exchange rate has been relatively stable in recent months and below its 10-year average.
Staff’s stability assessment shows the external position to be broadly in line with fundamentals
(Annex 1). Gross international reserves are adequate, including by the IMF’s ARA metric.

continued to slow despite declining lending rates.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
8.
GDP growth is projected to soften in 2016 but pick up in the medium term. In 2016,
GDP growth is projected to slow down to 2.2 percent mostly reflecting stalled investment and some
moderation in credit growth. Assuming elections in December followed by stable government,
growth is projected to increase to 3.2 percent in 2017 with some pick-up in outer years benefiting
from infrastructure investment, continued improvement in labor market and some strengthening of
credit growth (Table 1). Staff’s analysis shows that the authorities’ planned infrastructure investment
during 2014-18 is likely to contribute to growth by ½ percentage points annually in the medium
term including by improving productivity.2 Headline inflation turned positive in September 2016 and
is projected to gradually reach 2 percent by end-2018. Staff projects a widening of the current
account deficit in the medium term to around 3 percent of GDP reflecting higher interest and
dividend payments and lower transfers (Tables 1 and 3). A modest strengthening of FDI inflows is
anticipated based on expectations of political stability. Despite strong growth, external debt-to-GDP
ratio is projected to rise above 70 percent of GDP in the medium term reflecting large financing
needs of the public sector.
9.
This positive outlook is highly contingent on return of political stability. A derailment of
the agreement among main political parties and further postponement of elections could
significantly affect near-term growth with related negative impacts on the financial sector and the
fiscal balance. In 2017, real GDP growth could drop to below 2 percent through further confidence
loss and weaker credit growth that would impact private consumption and investment. The banking
sector could see renewed pressures of deposit outflows and currency conversion with a decline in
2

It is important to note that public infrastructure investment is mostly carried out by a non-financial public enterprise,
and therefore, financed outside of the general government budget. See Selected Issues Paper “Public Infrastructure
Investment and Economic Growth in FYR Macedonia” for details.

foreign exchange reserves. The fiscal deficit is likely to be notably higher than envisaged in the
baseline due to lower revenue collections, particularly from VAT, unless offsetting expenditure cuts
are made. A further rise in the sovereign risk premium could pose financing constraints. The impact
on the current account balance would depend on the degree of currency conversion pressures. The
trade balance may improve in 2017 through lower imports as long as activities in the TIDZ continue
(the political crisis has so far not impacted exports from the zone) and external conditions, such as
demand in key partner countries and commodity prices, remain favorable. This may, however, be
countered by deterioration in the secondary income account if currency conversion pressures are
strong. A prolonged political crisis may also impact FYR Macedonia’s image as an FDI destination
slowing investment inflows for several years. In addition to domestic political crisis, other downside
risks include slower-than-projected global or euro area growth, spillover from possible financial
volatility in Greece and intensification of the refugee crisis (Box 2). The flow of migrants has
drastically slowed since the border closures in early March. But uncertainties linger regarding
implementation of the EU-Turkey agreement which could reignite refugee inflows.
10.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s economic outlook and risks. They considered
domestic political crisis as the most significant risk and stressed its negative impact on activities.
They viewed continued FDI inflows, solid growth and improving employment as testament to the
economy’s resilience to shocks. Benefiting from foreign investment, exports have undergone a
transformation in favor of automobile and chemical products establishing links with global supply
chains which are expected to sustain strong growth in the medium term. Their estimates show that
net exports from TIDZ averaged around 2.6 percent of GDP during 2014–15 which are expected to
increase as these companies reach full capacity. They viewed risks of spillovers from Greece and the
refugee crisis to be contained and noted no impact of Brexit yet. The authorities see little risks from a
prolonged period of low inflation given it is driven by external factors and also in light of the modest
level of private sector indebtedness.

relatively stable in proportion to GDP
(Figure 2). For 2016, staff projects the overall fiscal deficit to widen to 4 percent of GDP taking into
account spending increases in the two supplementary budgets. Gross fiscal financing needs for 2016
are substantial—around 15 percent of GDP, but are more than covered by the proceedings of the
recent bond issuance.
12.
Fiscal risks are on the rise. Public debt has been on an upward trajectory since 2008 and is
projected to reach 48 percent of GDP at end-2016. The rapid and sustained increase in public debt
has been accompanied by rising borrowing costs. In addition, fiscal slippages have become a
persistent feature with supplementary budgets issued almost every year during the last decade. In
August, Fitch downgraded FYR Macedonia’s sovereign rating by one notch to BB with negative
outlook citing the long-running political crisis and weak governance. On a positive note, the
structure of domestic public debt has shown significant improvements in recent years with longer
maturity, a higher share of fixed-rate debt, and a declining share of FX debt (Table 2, Figure 2).
However, at about 75 percent of the total public debt, FX debt still poses significant risks (Annex IV).
13.
Without measures, the overall fiscal deficit is likely to stay around 3½ percent of GDP
in the medium term. The authorities’ 2017 budget projects the fiscal deficit to decline to 3 percent
of GDP mainly relying on optimistic revenue projections. While the medium-term fiscal strategy is
currently under preparation, the authorities indicated their objective to bring the overall deficit to
around 2.6 percent of GDP in 2018. Nonetheless, no concrete policy measures have been identified.
Taking into account historical revenue performance and the baseline macroeconomic scenario, staff
projects the overall deficit to stay around 3½ percent of GDP and the primary deficit around 2
percent
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

of GDP in the medium term, exceeding the debt-stabilizing level (Annex IV). Public debt is projected
to reach almost 55 percent of GDP in the medium term.
14.
In addition, public finances face
long-term challenges from population ageing. At
4½ percent of GDP, FYR Macedonia’s pension deficit
is sizable. This reflects generous benefits, relatively
low contribution rates and low labor force
participation rates (Annex II). The pension deficit is
projected to reach 10½ percent of GDP by 2030,
reflecting declining working age population.
Afterwards, the deficit is projected to improve
benefitting from earlier parametric reforms although
would still stay sizable at above 5 percent of GDP.
Population ageing is also likely to put pressures on
public health spending.

Discussion
15.
Staff recommended fiscal consolidation to start without delay. Rising fiscal risks and
limited policy space call for strong and upfront consolidation to instill confidence. For 2016, given
the interim government and limited time left in the year, staff recommends a modest consolidation
of around 0.4 percent of GDP relying on temporary measures, such as scaling back goods and
services spending and collection of VAT arrears. For 2017 and 2018, assuming December
parliamentary election and stable government thereafter, staff recommends a reduction in the
overall fiscal deficit to 2½ percent and 2 percent of GDP respectively to stabilize public debt below
50 percent of GDP. This implies an adjustment in the cyclically-adjusted structural balance of
1¼ percent of GDP over the next two years. Any negative impact of the recommended consolidation
on private sector is expected to be mitigated by continued monetary accommodation and structural
reforms to ensure labor market improvement and steady FDI inflows.
16.
Medium term consolidation should rely on high-quality measures. Instead of relying on
one-off measures or under-execution of capital spending, staff reiterated the need to identify
revenue and expenditure measures to ensure durability.
a. Revenue measures. Given the authorities’ choice to maintain low tax rates, improving
efficiency, particularly that of VAT, needs to be a key component of fiscal consolidation.
Significant revenue gains can be expected from implementation of priority measures
identified by the recent TADAT assessment: strengthening coverage and targeting of
compliance risks, improving the operation of large tax payer office, and establishing a Risk
Management Unit with comprehensive and structured process to identify compliance risks. `

b. Expenditure measures. In light of their large shares in total expenditure, staff
recommended rationalization and better-targeting of subsidies and transfers.3 The World
Bank’s (WB) 2015 Public Expenditure Review highlights room for such savings, in particular
through rationalization of agricultural subsidies and transfers to local government which are
not well-targeted, as well as refraining from ad-hoc pension increases and generous
indexation. In addition, there is scope for efficiency gains in health and education spending
where same results can be achieved with lower spending.

associated with lower debt levels.

17.
The recommended fiscal adjustment is projected to stabilize public debt below
50 percent of GDP. In line with 2015 Article IV consultation, staff recommended keeping public debt
below 50 percent of GDP for the following reasons.
a. Recent analysis by IMF staff (Modernizing the Framework for Fiscal Policy and Public Debt
Sustainability Analysis) that looks at long-run debt thresholds for emerging market
economies points to 49-58 percent of GDP as the safe threshold. For FYR Macedonia, which
is a small open economy with limited policy space and significant vulnerabilities, a prudent
public debt ratio is likely to be at the lower bound of this range rather than the upper
bound. A growing body of empirical literature also shows lesser effectiveness of fiscal policy
when debt-to-GDP ratio is high.4 More specifically, for a group of European countries,
studies show responses of real GDP and private investment to fiscal stimulus becoming
negative when public debt level exceeds 50-60 percent of GDP (Nickel and Tudyka, 2014).
b. FYR Macedonia faces significant future spending pressures not just from ageing population
(paragraph 15), but also from infrastructure investment needs beyond what is planned in the
medium term. For a land-locked economy, improving connectivity is key to competitiveness

3

Social transfers and subsidies account for about 62 percent of FYR Macedonia’s total spending, compared to the
emerging markets Europe’s average of 47¼ percent in 2015.

and growth. Choosing a prudent debt limit in the medium term will enhance its ability to
accommodate longer-term spending pressures.
18.
Reforms to rein in the sizable pension deficit are warranted. Staff highlighted several
options: (i) raise statutory retirement age given the sizable gap of 3 years for men and 5 years for
women with the EU average; (ii) consider revising indexation (currently indexed as 50/50 to
CPI/wage) to mostly CPI in line with many countries in the EU; (iii) implement reforms to increase
labor force participation, particularly that of women (one of the lowest in Europe), and (iv) consider
increasing contribution rates if sustainability is not secured through other measures.
19.
The authorities agreed with staff on the need to rebuild fiscal policy space. They drew
attention to the importance of fiscal policy in supporting the economy during the global financial
crisis. Going forward, they envisaged the role of the government as largely that of an enabler to
maximize private sector’s contributions to the economy. They acknowledged the rapid rise in public
debt, and reiterated the commitment to consolidate their fiscal positions to contain risks and rebuild
buffers. The authorities see fiscal consolidation rely on (i) a broadening of the tax base from stronger
growth and enhanced revenue mobilization through modernization of the tax system, and (ii) higher
expenditure efficiency, including through strengthening the link between expenditure planning and
execution. On revenue measures, the authorities appreciated FAD’s advice and technical assistance
and noted that they are in the process of reviewing action plans following the recent TADAT
assessment.
20.
Preparations for the introduction of the fiscal rule, originally planned for January 2017,
are on hold. The authorities explained that this will need to wait until after a stable government.
Institutional readiness needs improvement given limited linkages between the medium-term budget
framework and the annual budget process, persistent over-projection of revenues and the periodic
build-up of public sector payment arrears. The legal framework for the fiscal rule should include
independent monitoring and oversight, as well as other enforcement mechanisms, such as corrective
measures to restore deviations over a certain period of time.

B. Monetary and Financial Policies: Maintaining Stability
Background
21.
Robust household credit growth has
sustained financial deepening. Given that pre-crisis
credit boom was mostly financed by domestic
deposits, post-crisis resumption of credit growth has
been more resilient compared to many others in
emerging Europe facing prolonged deleveraging by
parent institutions. Risks from household credit
growth appear low based on overall debt stock
(21 percent of GDP) and debt service relative to
income (8 percent). Most mortgage holders are also first-time house buyers.

22.
Banking sector is healthy and profitable. Banks are well-capitalized, with the capital
adequacy level twice the regulatory requirement of 8 percent. The NPL ratio fell to 7 percent in July
reflecting the recent measures to write off NPLs that are fully provisioned for more than two years
(Figure 4). Banks’ profitability continued to improve in light of strong growth in net interest income.
Structural liquidity in the banking system is ample and, according to NBRM’s latest stress tests,
provides strong buffers to withstand severe deposit outflow shocks. Liquid assets count for one third
of total assets in the banking system covering around 60 percent of household deposits and over
70 percent of liabilities with residual contractual maturity of up to 30 days.

However, the banking sector remains susceptible to deposit outflows. In April, an
intensification of the political crisis led to deposit outflow and currency conversion pressures
prompting the NBRM to increase the policy rate by 75 bps to 4 percent. The NBRM also sold a total
of 141 million euros (about 6 percent of its end-March stock of reserves of 2.26 billion) during
April-June and took the following macro-prudential measures (i) increased reserve requirement on
FX-linked deposits to 50 percent from 20 percent, and (ii) resumed FX deposit auctions offering
banks an interest rate higher than the current euro negative rate. These measures successfully
stabilized the exchange rate although lost household deposits have not fully returned to the system.
This was the second deposit run in the last eighteen months following an earlier episode in summer
2015 at the height of the financial crisis in Greece. A repeat of such episodes cannot be ruled out as
long as political uncertainties persist.

(Annex 1), continued deflation and still-negative
output gap, staff does not see reasons to increase the policy rate. However, in case of pressures on
the exchange rate or risk of deposit outflows, staff and the authorities agreed that the monetary
policy stance may need to be tightened by raising the policy rate along with stricter
macro-prudential policies, such as raising the reserve requirement on FX- or FX-linked deposits. In
staff’s views this could also include offering higher interest rate on FX deposit auctions.

25.
The authorities viewed the current pace of credit growth as satisfactory but expressed
concerns regarding slow deposit growth. Overall, a high single-digit growth rate for private sector
credit augurs well for financial deepening. There are risks of weakening of credit growth if household
deposits continue to stagnate. The authorities viewed current NFC credit growth to be solid given
political uncertainties and the very low post-crisis NFC credit growth in the rest of region reflecting
weak balance sheets and high credit standards. Staff highlighted structural impediments that may
also be weighing down NFC credit demand. A predominantly collateral-based lending system
together with very high collateral requirements (on average 180 percent of the loan value) deters
access to finance for the domestic private sector together with other regulatory hurdles (see
paragraph 30).
26.
The authorities expressed their intention to maintain the prudential measures that
were put in place to monitor the Greek-owned subsidiaries. In May 2016, the smaller Greekowned subsidiary Alpha Bank was sold to Switzerland-based Silk Road Investment Fund. The
remaining Greek-owned subsidiary Stopanska Bank is systemic (holds about a fifth of the system’s
assets), profitable, and fully domestic deposit-funded. Although contagion pressures are no longer
present, staff agreed with authorities’ decision to maintain current prudential measures for enhanced
surveillance (e.g., limits on intra-group exposure, daily deposit monitoring, ex-post notification for
parent-sub transaction, see SM/15/214 for details) given uncertainties in Greece. The temporary and
targeted capital flow measures adopted in June 2015 to prevent possible outflows to Greece expired
in December as planned.
27.
Cooperation between the NBRM and the European Single Supervisory Mechanism
(SSM) is satisfactory. In October 2015, FYR Macedonia, together with four other southeastern
European non-EU countries, signed a memorandum of understanding with the European Banking
16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA

Authority (EBA) to establish a framework for cooperation and information exchange. The authorities
are waiting for EBA to start the process of assessing the equivalence of the supervisory and
regulatory framework relative to that applied to EU countries. The 2008 FSAP update found the
NBRM’s regulation and supervision to be reasonably comprehensive and financial safety net
arrangements broadly adequate. Since then, particularly in the context of spillovers from the financial
crisis in Greece, the authorities have significantly enhanced their stress-testing and contingency
planning capacity. These actions, together with pro-active use of macro-prudential tools and an
effective communication strategy, have served FYR Macedonia well in navigating recent crises. The
authorities have requested participation in the FSAP to identify the financial system’s strengths, risks
and weaknesses in light of enhancements in the supervisory framework and macro-prudential
instruments since the global financial crisis.

possible overestimation, the rate is likely to be high. Staff’s earlier analyses show that high
unemployment is largely structural, mostly reflecting skills shortage and mismatch resulting from
emigration of skilled workers and low level of education. Disaggregated data point to lower
unemployment rates for workers with vocational training and tertiary education. Skills shortage is
also highlighted in business surveys as a key constraint to possible expansion.
29.
Notable FDI inflows in the last decade have helped investment and exports although
spillovers into the domestic economy is considered to be limited. Competitive wage, structural
reforms and generous financial benefits, including tax breaks, have attracted sizable manufacturing
FDI into FYR Macedonia since late 2000s, although less so than in emerging European peers. Staff’s
analysis shows that FDI inflows have contributed to real per capita growth annually by about

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA

1.3 percent in recent years.5 A lack of data precludes a thorough analysis of contributions to value
added and employment, but estimates and anecdotal evidence point to limited contributions.
Examples of successful FDI- and export-led growth in Central European countries highlight the
importance of generating higher domestic value added over time to sustain the interest of foreign
investors and contain the costs from financial incentives. In case of FYR Macedonia, emigration of
skilled labor, particularly in technical and engineering occupations, could pose some constraints to
such upward movement.

30.
Despite improvement in business environment, domestic firms continue to experience
impediments. FYR Macedonia currently ranks as number one in emerging Europe in the World
Bank’s Doing Business index. However, domestic firms continue to report difficulties in accessing
credit and collecting payments, and are burdened with various forms of unpredictable and ad-hoc
inspections that impose both financial and non-financial costs. A recent poll of 800 companies
carried out by the Economic Chamber of Macedonia shows that most respondents face considerable
delays in VAT refunds relative to that provisioned by the VAT law and debtor companies frequently
fail to meet their financial obligations set under the Financial Discipline Law.

Weak governance negatively impacts confidence and indirectly contributes to
emigration of skilled workers. The European Commission’s most recent assessment highlights
concerns about excessive political interference in public administration and judicial system (Box 3).
The World Economic Forum’s 2015-16 Global Competitiveness Index also ranks FYR Macedonia
unfavorably in the areas of judicial independence (ranked 98 out of 140). Weak governance holds
back trust in domestic institutions and policy making, and may indirectly contribute to emigration of

skilled labor. The effective implementation of the AML framework can complement anti-corruption
efforts.
Box 3. European Commission’s 2015 Assessment of FYR Macedonia 1/
The European Commission’s 2015 assessment report gives FYR Macedonia good marks for
maintaining macroeconomic stability but highlights significant weaknesses in business
environment, public administration, judiciary, and media freedom, which are elaborated below.
The EC sees scope for further improvement in business environment. Frequent legal changes,
uneven implementation of laws and difficult contract enforcement burden business operations.
The large informal economy continues to hamper competition. Government arrears still affect
companies’ liquidity. To improve access to finance for SMEs, which provide the bulk of jobs, the
EC recommends developing alternatives to bank lending and reduction in NPLs. The country is
moderately prepared to take on the obligations of the EU membership in the areas of public
procurement, statistics and financial control.
The EC notes some political interference with State institutions and the work of the
judiciary. There are serious concerns about the politicization of public service which needs a
renewed strategy, including more merit-based recruitment, enhanced public financial
management, and greater fiscal transparency. The situation of the judicial system has been
deteriorating since 2014 against the background of political interference in certain high profile or
politically sensitive cases. This casts a shadow over an otherwise functioning judiciary. A track
record of effective prosecution, especially on high level corruption, still needs to be established.
As a result, public trust in the functioning of the institutions has further eroded.
Freedom of media needs improvement. The EC data shows the country continued to regress in
terms of media freedom during last year. Political interference in the editorial policies of the
media, in particular mainstream nationwide broadcasters, is a concern.

Discussion
32.
Staff highlighted the importance of labor market reforms in light of still high
unemployment and low labor force participation. Policies to improve vocational training and
on-the-job training are bearing fruit and should continue although being mindful of fiscal costs. The
authorities mentioned that reducing unemployment is one of the highest priority of the government
supported by policies to stimulate demand, improve skills match and activate people at risks. The
active labor market policies are designed to meet employers’ needs and are continuously monitored
and evaluated. Staff emphasized the need to increase labor force participation, particularly that of
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA

young and female labor force, in order to support long-term growth against the background of
ageing population. The authorities mentioned family responsibilities being at the core of low female
participation, particularly in light of large emigration of male population, as well as low educational
attainment rather than policy disincentives. They expect positive results from implementation of
several EU-funded projects targeting both youth and female employment. Improving governance
and easing regulatory environment for the domestic private sector would enhance productivity along
with authorities’ planned infrastructure upgrading.

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
The economy has endured a number of shocks in the last two years, including a
prolonged political crisis. Growth has so far shown resilience benefiting from accommodative
policies, low commodity prices, sustained foreign investment and improving labor market conditions.
However, the prolonged domestic political crisis is beginning to take a toll on confidence and the
country’s EU accession prospects. An extended period of accommodative fiscal policy has helped
support domestic demand, but has also depleted policy space to counter further shocks.
34.
GDP growth is projected to soften in 2016 but pick up in the medium term contingent
on return of political stability. Real GDP growth is projected to slow down to 2.2 percent in 2016
reflecting stalled investment and some moderation in credit growth partly impacted by political
uncertainties. Assuming elections in December followed by stability, growth is expected to pick up to
3.2 percent in 2017 and further in the medium term benefiting from infrastructure and foreign direct
investment, continued improvement in the labor market and some strengthening of credit growth. In
addition to political uncertainties, the outlook faces a number of other downside risks, notably a
slowdown in external demand and renewed financial turmoil in Greece.
35.
Fiscal policy space has largely been depleted amidst rising risks. Public debt has more
than doubled since 2008 and is projected to reach 48 percent of GDP this year. The fast rise in debt is
mostly due to rising primary deficits which, in turn, reflect a combination of low tax rates and low
collection efficiency on the revenue side, and inefficiencies in social spending and subsidies on the
expenditure side. For 2016, staff projects a widening in the overall fiscal deficit to 4 percent of GDP.
In the medium term, without measures, overall fiscal deficit is projected to stay around 3½ percent
of GDP with public debt reaching almost 55 percent of GDP. Meanwhile, rising borrowing costs, high
fiscal financing needs and recent sovereign downgrading by Fitch have raised near-term fiscal risks.
Public finances also face long-term challenges from population ageing.
36.
Fiscal consolidation should start without delay. To counter risks and create fiscal policy
space, consolidation should start now to stabilize public debt-to-GDP ratio below 50 percent. For
2016, given the caretaker government and little time left in the year, a small consolidation of 0.4
percent of GDP is recommended relying on scaling back of goods and services spending and
collection of VAT arrears. For 2017-18, a consolidation of 1¼ percent of GDP in the cyclicallyadjusted structural primary balance is recommended.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA

37.
Medium-term fiscal consolidation should rely on high-quality measures. In the last two
years, improvement in the cyclically-adjusted fiscal balance has mostly relied on under-execution of
capital spending. To produce durable results and enhance confidence, particularly in light of the
authorities’ intention to introduce a fiscal rule, consolidation should be based on durable measures.
On the revenue side, this entails raising collections, particularly that of VAT, by strengthening
coverage, targeting compliance risks, improving the operation of large tax payer office, and
establishing a Risk Management Unit. On the expenditure side, a reduction of subsidies and transfers
together with greater efficiency in health and education spending would yield the required savings.
38.
Ensuring sustainability of the pension system is an important medium-term goal.
Despite earlier parametric reforms and introduction of a multi-pillar system, the PAYG
(pay-as-you-go) system faces significant financial imbalances due to population ageing and cuts in
the contribution rate. The pension deficit, which is sizable at 4½ percent of GDP, is projected to more
than double by 2030 without further reforms. To ensure sustainability, the authorities are
encouraged to consider raising statutory retirement age given the sizable gap with the EU average,
revising indexation to mostly link to the CPI in line with many countries in the EU, implementing
policies to increase labor force participation, and increasing contribution rates.
39.
Current monetary policy stance is appropriate. Historically low interest rates have helped
sustain robust private sector credit growth and domestic demand without jeopardizing external
stability. Given still-negative output gap, low core inflation and moderate real exchange rate
undervaluation, low policy rate is appropriate. However, in case of pressures on the exchange rate or
risks of deposit outflows, the monetary policy stance may need to be tightened by raising the policy
rate along with stricter macro-prudential policies. Official reserves are deemed adequate and
projected to improve in the medium term on the back of strong exports, continued FDI and other
financial inflows.
40.
Continued vigilance is required for an otherwise healthy and profitable banking sector.
Banks are well-capitalized and profitable. Structural liquidity in the banking system is ample and,
according to NBRM’s latest stress tests, provides strong buffers to withstand severe deposit outflow
shocks. Macro prudential policies have been successful in maintaining banking system stability
through recent episodes of deposit and exchange rate pressures. Continued vigilance is needed to
preserve this record.
41.
Efforts to reduce high structural unemployment should continue. Benefitting from active
labor market policies and broad-based growth, overall unemployment rate has declined by
10 percentage points since 2008. However, at 24 percent, unemployment is still high and mostly
structural reflecting a shortage of skilled labor. Active labor market policies targeting on-the-job
training are bearing fruit and should be continued mindful of fiscal costs.
42.
Policies to attract FDI have contributed to net exports and growth. Competitive wages,
reduced regulations and financial benefits have attracted sizable FDI in recent years. While these

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA

flows have contributed to investment and exports, spillover into domestic economy is considered
limited. To ensure broad-based benefits and sustainability of the FDI-led growth strategy,
complementary reforms to remove impediments faced by the domestic private sector, such as
constrained access to finance and unpredictability of business environment, are recommended.

Annex I. An Assessment of External Stability and Competitiveness
Current account based estimates show the exchange rate to be broadly in line with fundamentals.
FYR Macedonia’s current account (CA) deficit has narrowed significantly in recent years, from the historical
average of around 4¼ percent of GDP during 2003–2014 to 2.1 percent of GDP in 2015. The decline in oil
prices and the expansion of export capacities
contributed to this improvement. Estimates using the
Fund’s recently developed EBA-lite tools1 show a norm
of -3.9 percent of the cyclically-adjusted CA, in which the
norm incorporates the policy gap of -1.6 percent
resulting from fiscal policy (-0.2 percent), private sector
credit (0.3 percent) and reserves (-1.7 percent) vis-à-vis
medium-term objectives. This implies a CA gap of
1.4 percent of GDP. An alternative measure based on
external sustainability concept to stabilize the current

level of IIP suggests a norm of -3.2 percent of GDP.
FYR Macedonia’s net international investment position (IIP) deteriorated slightly to -54.6 percent
of GDP in 2015, compared to -53.1 percent of GDP in 2014. The decline was mainly due to the
issuance of a government bond and FDI-related debt. Over the medium-term, the net IIP is likely to stay
at the same level in percent of GDP despite strong economic growth due to rising public debt and current
account deficits.

The External Balance Assessment (EBA) methodology has been developed by the IMF as a successor to the former CGER
exercise. There are two important differences. First, EBA makes a sharper distinction between positive (descriptive)
understanding of current accounts and real exchange rates and making normative evaluations. Second, EBA takes into
account a much broader set of factors—including policies, cyclical factors, and global capital market conditions—that may
influence the current account and real exchange rate. For more details, see “The External Balance Assessment (EBA)
methodology,” IMF Working Paper No.13/272. EBA-lite model has been developed using the same methodology for
countries not included in EBA. For more details, see “Methodological Note on EBA-Lite” at
http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2016/020516.pdf.

The real effective exchange rate was relatively stable in 2015. Estimated real exchange rate gap
based on the EBA-lite CA model implies slight undervaluation of about 4.7 percent. Meanwhile, the
EBA-lite REER and External Sustainability approach suggest the real exchange rate to be close to the
equilibrium level. Overall, these estimates suggest that there are no significant real exchange rate
misalignments.
Reserve coverage in FYR Macedonia is broadly adequate according to various reserve adequacy
metrics. Gross international reserves accounted for 2.26 billion euros at end-2015. The reserve level
was above the standard rules of thumb (three months of prospective imports and 20 percent of broad
money). It also stayed in line with the Fund’s ARA metric. By debt metrics, in 2015 reserves fell slightly
fell short of 100 percent of short-term debt at remaining maturity benchmark, but is projected to
strengthen in the medium term. In light of large downside domestic and external risks and significant
eurorization of the financial sector, a prudent stance with moderate reserve accumulation would be
appropriate.

Other competitiveness indicators also point to soundness. Labor costs have been in line with
productivity developments. FYR Macedonia’s share in foreign markets have seen strong growth in
recent years reflecting foreign investment and expansion of export capacity in the free trade zone
with some moderation in 2015.

Annex II. Sustainability of the Pension System
FYR Macedonia’s public pension system currently suffers from significant financial imbalances.
The pension system comprises three pillars: the first PAYG (pay- as-you-go) pillar, the second
mandatory fully-funded pension pillar where new labor market entrants after 2003 are obliged to join
and the third voluntary fully-funded pension pillar. The pension deficit, defined as pension revenues
net of pension expenditure, has increased from nearly 3 percent of GDP in 2007 to 4½ percent of GDP
in 2014 contributing significantly to the overall fiscal deficit. The deterioration reflects the following
developments.
Rapid ageing of population: The share of population aged over 65 in the total population has
increased to 12.7 percent in 2015 from 8 percent in 1995. This trend is projected to continue, with the
share of population aged over 65 reaching 28.6 percent in 2060. At the same time, overall population is
projected to decline drastically after 2030.
Low contribution rates: The authorities have lowered the contribution rate several times to improve
labor cost competitiveness, putting FYR Macedonia among countries with the lowest pension
contribution rates in Europe.
Relatively generous pension benefits: The pension replacement rate, which stood at 56 percent in
2014, was the most generous among transition economies, and even higher than in several
high-income EU member states such as Germany, Sweden, Norway, and Finland.
Low effective retirement age: The authorities have increased the statutory retirement age (to 64 for
men and 62 for women), abolished general early retirement and tightened eligibility criteria for
disability pension. However, effective retirement age in FYR Macedonia around 61 years is lower than
in most countries in the region.

Annex IV. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
General government and public debt is projected to increase, driven by primary deficits and
external financing for public investments. High gross financing needs and potential shocks to
growth constitute major risks. Stronger fiscal consolidation is therefore needed to stabilize debt and
rebuild fiscal space. Improvement in public debt management is visible and should be continued.
1.
General government debt is expected to rise by 7¾ percent of GDP over the
forecast horizon, to about 45¾ percent at end-2021. An increase in the general government
debt level in 2016 is driven by widening fiscal deficit—partially due to flood-related spending—
which is expected to be mainly financed by domestic T-bills and Eurobond issuance (of
€450 million at 5.625% yield) in July 2016. Debt accumulation over the medium term is mainly
driven by primary deficit and partially offset by favorable growth prospects.
2.
Public sector debt, including that of non-financial public sector, is expected to rise
to nearly 55 percent of GDP by end-2021, up from 44 percent of GDP in 2015. Publicly
guaranteed debt of public non-financial enterprises, including that of the Public Enterprise for
State Roads (PESR) – the main implementer of public transport infrastructure projects, is
expected to grow by nearly 4 percent of GDP during the next few years, reflecting continued
borrowing to finance public infrastructure investments. Publicly guaranteed debt of public
non-financial enterprises is projected to gradually decline after 2018 due to scheduled debt
repayments.
3.
Stronger fiscal consolidation is needed to stabilize debt and rebuild fiscal space.
While the level of public debt is not alarmingly high, the speed of debt accumulation since the
global financial crisis raises caution. Baseline gross financing needs are above the benchmark,
and adverse shocks, particularly in GDP growth could result in general government and public
debt well above 50 and at 60 percent of GDP, respectively, by 2021. Space for fiscal policy, the
main countercyclical stabilization policy tool in FYR Macedonia, is limited. The general
government primary deficit is expected to be around 2.1 percent of GDP by 2021, 0.6 percentage
points higher than the debt-stabilizing primary balance, revealing a pressing need for stronger
fiscal consolidation.
4.
The improvement in public debt management is welcome and should be continued.
These improvements are most significant in the domestic government securities market. The
average maturity of outstanding government securities has increased significantly from less than
12 months in 2011 to more than 4 years by 2015, reflecting increasing reliance on long-term
borrowing. In the meantime, the share of foreign currency denominated domestic government
securities has declined from 90 percent in 2009 to around 30 percent in 2015. Interest rates on all
types of securities have decreased noticeably. However, overall a large share of public debt is still
denominated in foreign currencies and improvements in public debt management should
continue.

1/ Public sector is defined as general government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over German bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Description

Primary Balance Shock

Minimum shock equivalent to 50% of planned adjustment (50%
implemented), or baseline minus half of the 10-year historical standard
deviation, whichever is larger. There is an increase in interest rates of
25bp for every 1% of GDP worsening in the primary balance.

3.7

Real GDP Growth Shock

Real GDP growth is reduced by 1 standard deviation for 2 consecutive
years; revenue-to-GDP ratio remains the same as in the baseline; level
of non-interest expenditures is the same as in the baseline;
deterioration in primary balance lead to higher interest rate (see
above); decline in growth leads to lower inflation (0.25 percentage
points per 1 percentage point decrease in GDP growth).

5.2

Interest Rate Shock

Interest rate increases by difference between average real interest rate
level over projection and maximum real historical level, or by 200bp,
whichever is larger.

1.8

Real Exchange Rate Shock

Estimate of overvaluation or maximum historical movement of the
exchange rate, whichever is higher; pass-through to inflation with

IMF–WORLD Bank Collaboration
Background
The Bank and the Fund country teams on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia maintained
close collaboration, seeking synergies and harmonizing policy recommendations. Close
coordination has resulted in largely shared views of the economic situation in the country.

Key Areas of World Bank Involvement


The World Bank program in FYR Macedonia focuses on two interrelated themes: i) Growth
and Competitiveness; and ii) Skills and Inclusion. For Growth and Competitiveness,
successful poverty reduction would need sustained private sector led growth, making FYR
Macedonia more attractive as a destination for investments and as a country whose private
companies can compete at the regional and global level. For Skills and Inclusion, the fruits
of growth can be shared broadly if more Macedonians have access to better jobs and if
public services are of good quality and delivered efficiently. Since FYR Macedonia’s future
is clearly linked to the European integration, the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)
actively promotes the EU accession agenda and this represents a cross-cutting theme of
the strategy. Next fiscal year is the mid-term of the CPS implementation, and the Bank is
planning a Performance and Learning Review, which will be an opportunity to evaluate
progress with the strategy and consider possible adjustments for the outer years.



The Bank continues to be engaged in the transport sector through two projects. The National
and Regional Roads Rehabilitation Project (US$ 71 million) is helping enhance the connectivity of
selected national and regional roads, primarily to Corridors X and VIII, and to improve the Public
Enterprise for State Roads' capacity for road safety and climate resilience. The new Road Upgrading
and Development Project’s objective (US$90.95 million) is to improve transport connectivity for
road users along Corridor VIII between Skopje and Deve Bair, and to improve the asset
management and planning functions of the Public Enterprise for State Roads. The
implementation of the Electric Power Development Energy Community of South East Europe
Project APL3 (US$44 million) is in its final phase. Its objective was to improve the transmission
grid, including an interconnection with Serbia. There are two investments in the area of local
government development. The first is the Municipal Services Improvement Project (MSIP)
(US$75 million), which is helping to improve transparency, financial sustainability and delivery
of targeted municipal services in selected municipalities. The high demand from the
municipalities has led to a second Municipal Services Improvement Project (US$28.04 million),
approved in January this year, which is still not effective. In addition to this, the EU has provided

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA

additional financing of US$17.72 million, to complement MSIP activities in rural municipalities.
The World Bank is also active in the human development sector through the Conditional Cash
Transfer Project (US$25 million), and the Skills Development and Innovation Support Project
(US$24 million).


The Local and Regional Competitiveness Project is financed by an EU Trust Fund of
US$19.36 million, with the objective of enhancing the contribution of tourism to local
economic development and improving the capacity of the government and public entities to
foster tourism growth.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of September 29, 2016)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Areas that
would benefit most from further improvement are national accounts and government finance statistics.

National accounts: Quality of national account measurement need to be improved. In 2013, by
Decision of the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, amendments were made to the National
Classification of Activities—NKD Rev.2 and entailed significant changes in the decomposition of
historical data. The primary objective of the Classification of Activities is to provide a basis for
comparing statistical data of the Republic of Macedonia on European and world level, i.e. in its content
and structure is completely harmonized with the European Classification of Activities NACE Rev.2.
Price statistics: Improvements to the CPI have been introduced in accordance with international
standards and EU regulations to align the Classification of Individual Consumption According to
Purpose (COICOP).
Government finance statistics: Debt data on a disaggregated basis for the broader public sector are
not available on a regular basis. Macedonia does not report government finance statistics to the Fund
for publication in either the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) or the International Financial
Statistics (IFS).

Monetary sector: EUR receives a monthly electronic report of monetary statistics, covering the balance
sheet of the central bank, the commercial banks and other depository corporations.

External sector: External sector statistics meet international standards. In additional to monthly
balance of payments data, the authorities compile and disseminate international investment position
(IIP) data, reserve assets and foreign currency liquidity data, and external debt statistics.
II. Data Standards and Quality
FYR Macedonia participates in the General Data
Data ROSC published on September 29, 2004.
Dissemination System (GDDS), and, since
November 2011, in the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS).
