IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with United Arab Emirates

On July 29, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation and endorsed the staff appraisal without a meeting.1
Lower oil prices are eroding long-standing fiscal and external surpluses, but the UAE has
continued to benefit from its perceived safe haven status and large fiscal and external buffers that
have helped limit negative spillovers from lower oil prices, sluggish global growth, and volatility
in emerging market economies.
Nonoil growth remained robust at 4.8 percent in 2014, driven by construction, notably owing to
capital spending in Abu Dhabi, and services underpinned by Dubai’s transportation and
hospitality sectors. Real estate market prices have edged down since mid-2014. With past
increases in rents only feeding gradually into consumer prices, inflation increased to 4.3 percent
year-on-year in May 2015, also reflecting upward adjustments of electricity and water tariffs in
Abu Dhabi. Credit to the private sector has picked up. GREs have continued to strengthen their
finances.
The economic outlook is expected to moderate amid lower oil prices. Nonoil growth is projected
to slow to 3.4 percent in 2015, before increasing to 4.6 percent by 2020, supported by the
implementation of megaprojects and private investment in the run-up to Expo 2020. Growth in
oil production will likely to moderate given the global supply glut. Annual inflation is projected
to pick up to 3.8 percent in 2015. The overall fiscal balance this year is expected to turn negative
for the first time since 2009 to record a deficit of 2.9 percent of GDP, but is expected to return to
surpluses from 2016. The current account surplus is also projected to decline substantially, to
5 percent of GDP and will slowly increase with the projected gradual recovery in oil prices.
Credit growth is expected to remain supportive of the activity.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
In concluding the 2015 Article IV consultation with the United Arab Emirates, Executive
Directors endorsed staff’s appraisal, as follows:
Lower oil prices have increased macro-financial stability risks. Prudent economic policies,
progress in economic diversification, and the safe-haven status of the UAE have helped build
large fiscal and external buffers and strengthen the resilience of the economy. Also, the
implementation of megaprojects and private investment in the run-up to Expo 2020 are expected
to support activity over the medium term. However, lower oil prices are eroding fiscal and
external surpluses, and going forward a hike in the US interest rate could lead to a tightening of
financial conditions. These risks could be exacerbated by high volatility in stock markets, high
NPLs, and low banking system liquidity if government and GREs withdraw deposits.
The macroeconomic policy mix should focus on gradual fiscal consolidation, while maintaining
the peg and easing liquidity management if needed. The authorities’ plan to consolidate the fiscal
position is appropriate, and would reduce fiscal vulnerability and ensure intergenerational equity.
Fiscal consolidation will also help bring the external position closer to the level consistent with
medium-term fundamentals. However, its pace should take into account the available fiscal
buffers and the impact on the broad economy. The authorities’ monetary policy framework
which aims to maintain the peg while strengthening liquidity management and deepening money
markets, is appropriate. In an adverse scenario with a decline in deposits, liquidity management
could be eased to support credit growth. Government deficit financing should avoid a tightening
in liquidity in the banking system.
Fiscal consolidation requires rationalization of spending, but the quality of spending cuts is
crucial to avoid damaging the country’s competitiveness and long-term growth prospects.
Government investments should be preserved relative to nonhydrocarbon GDP to support
infrastructure, while the implementation of GRE megaprojects should be gradual, in line with the
expected demand. Public sector wage bill growth should be controlled while energy subsidies
and capital and other transfers should be reduced. Raising more nonhydrocarbon revenues
through new tax measures should also be considered. Fiscal policy implementation requires
further strengthening annual budget processes, including strong Public Finance Management
Systems, and integrating and operationalizing medium-term budget frameworks. Close oversight
and continued strengthening of debt management frameworks are crucial.
Plans to strengthen the banking regulatory and supervisory framework by the CBU, with no
exemptions in holding banks accountable, are welcome. The banking sector is resilient and has
enough capital and liquidity buffers to withstand an adverse shock. The CBU plans to phase in
Basel III capital and liquidity standards over 2015–19 and to strengthen its risk-based
supervision are welcome and should be timely implemented. As the corporate sector structure in
the UAE is characterized by large GREs and family groups, compliance by banks with the loan
concentration limits for GREs and local governments is challenging and should be monitored,

including the planned transition paths for banks exceeding the limits with no-exemption.
Developing domestic debt markets would reduce the reliance on external funding and bank
lending, helping banks comply with loan concentration limits. Over the medium term, the
authorities should consider developing resolution frameworks, and establishing deposit insurance
mechanisms. Efforts on strengthening the AML/CFT framework should continue.
Authorities should strengthen their macroprudential framework, building on their successful
implementation of real estate-specific measures. Macroprudential policies such as maximum
LTVs for mortgages and DSTI limits help reduce excessive exposures by the banking system
associated with systemic risk. However, the current macroprudential policy framework needs to
be strengthened in line with best practices such as formalizing a financial stability mandate in the
central bank law, establishing a Financial Stability Committee at the central bank level, and
institutionalizing coordination with the Ministry of Finance and other relevance agencies.
Continued strengthening of GREs balance sheets and active management of their upcoming debt
repayments, while raising risk-weights of bank lending to GREs if needed, will be important in
reducing macro-financial vulnerabilities.
Structural reforms should aim at further diversifying the economy and accelerating private
sector-led job creation for nationals. These could include: further opening up foreign direct
investment, improving selected areas of business environment, transitioning toward a
knowledge-based economy, easing access to finance for startups and SMEs, and creating the
right incentives for entrepreneurship and job creation.
Staff encourages the authorities to build on recent progress in improving statistics. Staff
welcomes efforts in implementing an inter-agency project to compile the International
Investment Position, which will close an important statistical gap, including for the reporting of
foreign assets and debt. It will be important to press ahead with this project and provide adequate
resources for improving the quality of overall balance of payments statistics. It will also be
essential to develop more comprehensive demographic and labor markets statistics, while
disseminating complete data on Dubai GRE debt.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. Lower oil prices are eroding long-standing fiscal and external surpluses, but
the impact on economic activity in the UAE has been limited owing to large buffers. Real
estate prices have declined somewhat since mid-2014, but rents are driving up inflation.
Following fiscal consolidation in 2013, the fiscal stance was expansionary in 2014.
Outlook and risks. The economic outlook is expected to moderate amid lower oil
prices. Nonoil growth is projected to slow in 2015, before accelerating in the medium
term. Export and revenue losses from lower oil prices will be the most significant
transmission channel for the UAE economy.
Macroeconomic policy mix. With persistently lower oil prices, gradual fiscal
consolidation is important to strengthen long-term fiscal sustainability while cushioning
negative effects on growth. It will require rationalization of spending and further
mobilization of nonhydrocarbon revenues. Efforts on strengthening the medium-term
budget frameworks need to continue. Liquidity management should remain supportive
of credit growth.
Financial stability. The banking sector is well capitalized, liquid, profitable, and with low
NPLs. Timely implementation of the CBU’s plans to phase in Basel III capital and liquidity
standards over 2015–19 will be important. Further developing the macroprudential
framework and strengthening safety nets and the resolution framework for banks as well
as the AML/CFT framework will also be important. Compliance with the loan
concentration limits for GREs and local governments should be monitored and no
exemption should be granted. Strengthening GRE balance sheets and proactive
management of upcoming GRE debt repayments should continue.
Economic diversification. Implementation of structural reforms should be pursued to
strengthen competitiveness and accelerate private sector-led job creation for nationals.
These could focus on further opening up foreign direct investment, improving selected
areas of the business environment, and easing access to finance for startups and SMEs.

BACKGROUND
1.
Lower oil prices are eroding long-standing fiscal and external surpluses, but negative
effects on economic activity in the UAE have been limited since mid-2014 (Figures 1-5). The
UAE has continued to benefit not only from its perceived safe haven status but also from its large
fiscal and external buffers that have helped limit negative spillovers from lower oil prices, sluggish
global growth, and volatility in emerging market economies. Strong growth in the Dubai services
sector and expansionary fiscal policies in Abu Dhabi helped cushion the effect of lower oil prices on
the broader economy in 2014.
2.
Macro-financial stability risks have
increased since end-2013. Lower oil prices and the
appreciation of the effective exchange rate are
weighing on the macroeconomic outlook and credit
risks and have led to a tightening of monetary and
financial conditions. Large external buffers have
continued to limit inward spillover risks. The buildup
of liquidity buffers in the banking system has helped
reduce market and liquidity risks.

Against this backdrop, reforms to strengthen macro-financial stability and continue
economic diversification are critical. Consistent with IMF staff advice, the authorities have been
implementing a number of reforms aimed at mitigating vulnerabilities and strengthening the
macroeconomic policy framework, including bolstering the GRE and banking sectors and
strengthening fiscal policy coordination and economic statistics. The new context of lower oil prices
and the prospective normalization of US monetary policy calls for resuming fiscal consolidation,
strengthening macroprudential, regulatory and supervisory frameworks, and pursuing economic
diversification.
Status of Staff Recommendations Made during the 2014 Article IV Consultation
Recommendation

Current Status

Gradual fiscal consolidation

The fiscal stance was expansionary with the adjusted nonhydrocarbon deficit increasing to 36.7 percent of
nonhydrocarbon GDP in 2014 from 35.4 percent in 2013.

Strengthening the annual budget process
and adopt a medium-term fiscal framework

The federal Ministry of Finance and the Dubai Department of Finance have strengthened budget processes
and developed medium-term fiscal frameworks. The Abu Dhabi Department of Finance has submitted a
draft medium-term budget framework prepared under the Abu Dhabi Comprehensive Financial Plan to the
government for approval.

Closely coordination and prioritizaton of
GREs' planned projects

Abu Dhabi GREs have started to slow down nonessential projects. In Dubai, GRE projects continue to be
implemented at a measured pace.

Managing upcoming debt repayments
proactively

GREs have been proactive in managing debt repayments with Dubai World prepaying the 2015 maturity
and rescheduling another large maturity due in 2018.

Continuing to improve availability of
information on Dubai GRE debt

Information on Dubai GRE debt is not collected at the level of the Dubai government. Those GREs that are
listed disclose their financials in the annual reports.

Further strengthening the toolkit available
for enforcing bank supervision

Included in the central bank draft law.

Continuing to strengthen the regime for
AML/CFT

A recent regulation enhances the requirement to identify beneficial owners, including those of deposits.

Developing the local debt market

Authorities to push ahead with developing the domestic debt market to establish a benchmark yield curve.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Negative effects from the drop in oil prices, weaker global outlook, and regional
instability on growth in the UAE have been limited. Nonoil growth remained robust at
4.8 percent in 2014, driven by construction, notably owing to capital spending in Abu Dhabi, and
services underpinned by continued strength in Dubai’s transportation and hospitality sectors. The
Purchasing Manager’s Index as of end-June 2015 suggests that nonoil growth has slowed down
recently, but remains in positive territory. Data on passengers and cargo at the Dubai International
Airport as of end-April 2015 point to continued expansion. Hydrocarbon growth has also picked up
to 4 percent, and oil production in the first five months of 2015 has continued to remain on elevated
levels.
5.
Real estate prices have edged down since mid-2014, but rents are driving up inflation.
House prices in Dubai have declined slightly (Box 1), reflecting strong supply and slowing demand
stemming from lower oil prices, U.S. dollar appreciation, and structural measures such as the
tightening of industry self-regulation, higher real estate fees, and tighter macroprudential regulation
for mortgage lending. Following Dubai, house price growth has also started to decline in Abu Dhabi.
With past increases in rents only feeding gradually into consumer prices, inflation increased to
4.3 percent year-on-year in May 2015, also reflecting upward adjustments of electricity and water
tariffs in Abu Dhabi as well as higher costs of education and other services. Contributions to inflation
have been negative from clothing and almost nil from food, reflecting the effects of the appreciating
U.S. dollar.
6.
The current account surplus in 2014 narrowed due to falling oil prices, and the real
effective exchange rate (REER) appreciated. The current account surplus declined but was still
sizable (13.7 percent of GDP). Gross foreign inflows to the banking sector and foreign direct
investment remained steady, reflecting the UAE’s perceived safe-haven status and its competitive
business environment. Driven by the appreciation of the U.S. dollar, the REER appreciated by
3.3 percent in 2014, and by 9 percent in Q1 2015 compared to the average 2014 level.
7.
Following fiscal consolidation in 2013, the fiscal stance was expansionary in 2014.
Based on preliminary 2014 data, the planned consolidation of 2 percent of nonhydrocarbon GDP did
not materialize because of higher-than-expected Abu Dhabi government spending, in particular on
capital transfers. The fiscal stance was in fact expansionary with the adjusted nonhydrocarbon deficit
increasing to 36.7 percent of nonhydrocarbon GDP (from 35.4 percent in 2013), leading to an
increase in the fiscal break-even oil price, to $78 from $69 in 2013. The overall fiscal surplus declined
to 5 percent of GDP (from 10.4 percent in 2013).

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES

Box 1. United Arab Emirates: Real Estate Developments
The real estate market in the UAE has cooled down after expanding strongly in 2013 and the first half
of 2014. By end-2014, sales price increases moderated in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, and in March 2015, growth
in residential sales prices turned slightly negative in both Emirates, in year-on-year terms (based on Reidin
data). These developments are taking place amid increased supply, particularly in Dubai, and reduced
demand associated with lower oil prices and appreciating US dollar, and following the introduction of
mortgage regulations based on loan-to-value ratios and an increase in the property transfer fee in late 2013.
With the additional new supply in the market, Dubai’s sales’ prices are expected to further decline over the
course of the year, while constrained supply through 2017 will support prices in Abu Dhabi. The pace of rent
increases, based on new contracts only, slowed in Q1 2015. The rent component in the CPI basket, based on
both existing and new contracts, has been a major driver of inflation since September 2014. Price-to-rent
ratios have declined since mid-2014 in both metropolitan areas, indicating a healthy correction in the UAE’s
likely overpriced housing market. Correspondingly, gross rental yields have risen since mid-2014 (see charts
below), registering a 6 percent year-on-year increase in March 2015.
Other segments of the real estate market have also slowed down. The hotel market was buoyant in
Dubai in 2014, supported by a large number of tourists, but the fall in oil prices and the appreciation of the
U.S. dollar are expected to weigh on the performance of this market in 2015. Vacancy rates remain high in
the office market (23 and 25 percent in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, respectively), while new additions to supply
this year are expected to put downward pressure on office rents in Dubai (based on JLL reports). Retail
market rents rose rapidly in Dubai until mid-2014, but growth slowed down in late-2014. Forthcoming
supply is expected to slow price growth further in 2015.

Credit to the economy continued to recover with banks well capitalized and liquid,
while stock markets declined following the oil price plunge. Lending to the private sector picked
up to 11.5 percent year-on-year in December 2014 and to 3 percent year-to-April 2015. However,
credit standards for firms were tightened in Q4 2014 and Q1 2015. Domestic deposit growth
between 2013 and early 2014 was strong, boosting liquidity in the banking system, but slowed down

from their post-crisis
peak. The banking system remains profitable with a return on assets at 1.7 percent due to higher net
interest margins, non-interest income, and operational efficiency. The sharp drop in oil prices last
year has triggered a stock market correction and volatility—the stock market declined by 8.8 percent
in April 2015 year-on-year (average for Abu Dhabi and Dubai).
9.
GREs have continued to strengthen their finances. In Dubai, the major debt restructurings
from the 2008/9 crisis have been completed, several GREs made early repayments of upcoming
maturities, and Dubai World agreed with its creditors to reschedule a large maturity due in 2018.
With this, stronger financial positions and lengthened maturity profiles have further reduced debtrelated risks. Nonetheless, total government and GRE debt in Dubai continues to be significant at
136 percent of Dubai GDP, and tighter global financial conditions could imply markedly higher
financing costs for the GREs. In Abu Dhabi, GREs have substantially reduced their debt, and
upcoming maturities in the medium term are significantly lower than the levels expected last year.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
10.
The economic outlook is expected to moderate amid lower oil prices. Export and
revenue losses from lower oil prices will be the most significant transmission channel for the UAE
economy. With fiscal consolidation and an appreciating real effective exchange rate,
nonhydrocarbon growth is projected to slow to 3½ percent in 2015, before increasing to
4½ percent in the medium term, supported by the implementation of megaprojects and private
investment in the run-up to Expo 2020. Growth in hydrocarbon production will likely moderate
given the global supply glut. Annual inflation is projected to pick up to 3¾ percent in 2015 due to
the level effect, but is expected to decline year-on-year in the coming months supported by
moderating rents and lower imported inflation. Over the medium term, inflation should stabilize

around 3 percent. Credit to the private sector is expected to slow to 7.2 percent in 2015 as a result
of tighter lending standards and to increase over the medium term as private investment
accelerates. Current account surpluses are projected to decline substantially in 2015 due to lower oil
prices and will slowly increase with projected gradual recovery in oil prices remaining slightly weaker
than the levels consistent with fundamentals. The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s view on the
outlook.
11.
External and domestic conditions pose risks to the medium-term outlook (see Table 1).
The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment of risks.


External risks. The main external risk is persistently lower oil prices than in the baseline given
supply factors and weaker demand. The effects from lower oil prices could be exacerbated by
falling liquidity in the banking system, increased volatility in the stock markets, and disruptive
declines in the real estate sector. This could lead to asset quality deterioration in UAE banks.
Higher interest rates in the US could pose rollover risks and trigger an intensification of liquidity
strains on the Dubai government and its GREs with negative effects on domestic banks. By
contrast, geopolitical deterioration could raise global energy prices and support the UAE’s
external position. A lifting of sanctions on Iran could be beneficial for nonhydrocarbon growth in
the UAE (Box 2).



Domestic risks. The Dubai megaprojects, if not implemented prudently, may create additional
macro-financial risks for Dubai’s GREs, banks, and ultimately the government in light of the debt
overhang from the 2008/9 global financial crisis. Dubai’s total government and GRE debt
continues to be substantial at around US$143 billion, with about half of it falling due in 2015–20.

Box 2. The Economic Impact of the Removal of Iran Sanctions
The nonhydrocarbon economy in the UAE, particularly in Dubai, stands to benefit from an easing of
sanctions on Iran through increased trade and financial flows. If sanctions are lifted, Iran is expected to
gradually step up oil production from current levels and bring oil in floating storage to the market. Added
supply from Iran poses a modest downside risk for oil prices, but a removal of sanctions is also likely to lead
to an expansion of demand from Iran for goods and services from the UAE, a major hub for the region.
At US$12 billion, exports to Iran in 2013 accounted for 12 percent of the UAE’s total nonoil exports,
making Iran the UAE’s most important export destination after India. Exports to Iran consist largely of
re-exported goods that cycle through the UAE’s sophisticated port infrastructure. After growing steadily for
several years, exports leveled off and declined with the intensification of sanctions and enforcement efforts
since 2010-11. The UAE is well positioned to benefit from an opening of the Iran market by serving as a
transshipment point for renewed trade activity. Results from a simulation model suggest that a reversal of
sanctions could add 1 percentage point to real GDP growth over 2016-18 through higher nonhydrocarbon
exports alone.1

UAE: Trade with Iran

Source: Haver; Dubai Department of Tourism and Commerce
Marketing; and IMF staff calculations.

An agreement would boost demand from Iran for UAE services exports such as trade finance,
transportation, tourism, and hospitality. As a proxy for recent business and tourism activity, Dubai hotel
guests arriving from Iran have dropped by almost half since 2010. If sanctions are lifted, the additional
indirect impact of spending by tourists and business travelers in the broader economy could be significant.

The model assumes trade with Iran would gradually return to levels consistent with trends prior to the current sanctions
regime. About one-quarter of the gap between trade under the scenario of continued sanctions and the trend is assumed to be
permanently lost. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the official statistical agency of the UAE, are used but may
not be comprehensive. Alternative sources show different estimates for UAE-Iran trade. For example, data from the Dubai
Chamber show a larger decline in exports to Iran over 2011-13. The trade loss from sanctions may thus be underestimated in this
context.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Against the backdrop of lower oil prices, discussions focused on resuming fiscal consolidation, further
strengthening financial sector stability while mitigating potential risks from Government-Related
Entities(GRE), and pursuing structural reforms to accelerate economic diversification and job creation.

A. Living with Cheaper Oil while Achieving Intergenerational Equity
12.
Fiscal vulnerability has increased and the fiscal position, if it remains at today’s level,
will not be consistent with intergenerational equity. The fiscal break-even oil price is projected at
$72 a barrel in 2015, above the $62 Brent oil price projection. A PIH-based calculation suggests that
the current nonhydrocarbon primary deficit exceeds the level consistent with a constant real per
capita annuity that would ensure that future generations benefit as much from the exhaustible oil
wealth as the current generation (Annex I).
13.
The desirable macroeconomic policy mix in the coming years entails fiscal
consolidation, while maintaining the peg and easing liquidity management if needed.


With persistently lower oil prices, gradual fiscal consolidation is important to strengthen
long-term fiscal sustainability. The authorities plan consolidation of 2.8 percent of nonoil GDP
in 2015, and under their planned consolidation path, the fiscal position will adjust by a total of
13½ percent of nonoil GDP and be broadly in line with intergenerational equity by 2020.2 The
fiscal break-even oil price would already decline to levels below the projected oil price in 2016.3
Staff supported the plan to consolidate, but recommended a more gradual pace to cushion the
impact on nonhydrocarbon GDP growth, which could be about 1 percentage point annually.4
The authorities nonetheless preferred a faster pace of consolidation (realistically implementable
in staff’s view) to minimize tapping their sovereign wealth fund assets. The authorities noted that
their oil price projections in the medium term are lower than staff’s. Since the path of oil prices
over the medium term is uncertain, staff recommended developing contingency plans (Annex II
discusses the fiscal risks). In the event of an additional drop in the price of oil, the authorities
should use existing fiscal space to absorb the initial shock while consolidating over the medium
term.

2

If beyond the forecast period, consolidation continues in the same pace as envisaged for 2020 under the
authorities’ plans, the fiscal stance would be fully consistent with intergenerational equity by 2022.
3

The baseline scenario outlined in Tables 2–5 and the Annexes are based on the authorities’ planned adjustment.

4

Under the more gradual consolidation path that staff recommended, the fiscal stance would be in line with
intergenerational equity in 10–12 years, with a milder impact on nonhydrocarbon GDP growth of 0.5 percentage
point annually.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES

Fiscal consolidation will require rationalization of spending, while mobilization of
nonhydrocarbon revenues should also be considered. On the expenditure side, staff
recommended the following measures: (i) controlling public wage bill growth (stabilizing the size
per capita and limiting wage increases to correspond to productivity gains); (ii) continue
reducing energy and water subsidies and other transfers, while protecting those in need;5 (iii)
lowering capital transfers to Abu Dhabi GREs; and (iv) stabilizing other expenses in real terms.
The authorities noted that their consolidation package consists of similar measures but
emphasized that they plan a larger slowdown in capital and other transfers. Going forward, the
authorities should consider raising nonhydrocarbon revenues by introducing a VAT, in
coordination with the GCC countries, and broadening corporate income and excise taxes.6 The
authorities indicated that discussions are ongoing in the GCC to introduce VAT, but the timeline
is unclear. As regards to income tax reforms, the authorities noted that an impact study would
be needed before any broadening of the corporate income tax.

Government investment should be protected, while GREs should further prioritize planned
projects to avoid increasing fiscal vulnerabilities. Staff and the authorities agreed that
government-funded investment should be preserved relative to nonhydrocarbon GDP to
continue supporting infrastructure needed for maintaining the country’s competitiveness. With
upcoming megaprojects planned and executed mostly by GREs, staff recommended gradual
implementation of these projects, in line with the expected demand and considering contingent
liabilities, which will require close oversight and continued strengthening of debt management
frameworks in the different Emirates. Care should also be taken to prevent GRE activities from
crowding out private sector activity. Continued improvements in the availability of information
on GRE debt are crucial. The authorities agreed that GRE projects should be prioritized. They
noted that nonessential GRE projects in Abu Dhabi have been slowed down. In Dubai, GRE
projects will continue to be implemented at a measured pace, in line with aggregate demand.

Abu Dhabi increased water and electricity tariffs by 170 percent and 40 percent, respectively, in January 2015. With
lower oil prices, implicit subsidies on petroleum products are estimated to have almost disappeared. Implicit
subsidies on natural gas are still high.

The so-called Master Plan for Expo 2020, which will guide Expo-related activities (including
investment spending) before and after the event, will be approved by end-2015.


The longstanding exchange rate peg has served the UAE well and should be maintained.
The peg has anchored prices of tradables and thus inflation, and provided stability to income
flows and financial wealth in periods of both high and low oil prices. Therefore, given the large
external buffers, maintaining the peg is appropriate. However, adjustment through fiscal
consolidation is necessary to maintain the UAE’s external position at the level consistent with
medium-term fundamentals (Annex III).7 The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment. Going
forward, the authorities should proceed with reforms aimed at strengthening liquidity
management, deepening money and capital markets, and reducing foreign exchange exposure
of banks and corporations, so that over the medium term policy frameworks may evolve as
needed to continue to effectively manage demand and inflation pressures. The authorities are
committed to the exchange rate peg and agreed to the reforms aimed at strengthening policy
frameworks over the medium term.



Liquidity management should remain supportive of credit growth. Staff recommended that
the Central Bank should stand ready to use its liquidity management tools, as needed, to
support credit growth in an adverse scenario with deposit decline. In the meantime, deficit
financing should avoid full reliance on drawing down government deposits and instead tap
sovereign wealth funds or capital markets. While the authorities broadly agreed, their focus will
be on maintaining healthy liquidity.

14.
A strong macro-fiscal framework on a consolidated basis needs to be developed,
building on past progress and existing strengths. Progress has been achieved in strengthening
intergovernmental fiscal coordination. The Fiscal Policy Coordination Council now prepares
consolidated backward-looking fiscal data for the UAE. Building on the expertise accumulated at the
federal level, the authorities should now develop a consolidated forward-looking medium-term
fiscal framework to help set more clearly the direction for fiscal policy for the UAE as a whole. The
federal Ministry of Finance and the Dubai Department of Finance have strengthened budget
processes and have medium-term fiscal frameworks in place. The Abu Dhabi and Dubai
Departments of Finance have started introducing performance budgeting in a few pilot sectors.
Strengthening Abu Dhabi’s annual budget processes remains a priority: strong Public Finance
Management systems will need to be in place to keep spending in check (firm expenditure controls,
timely fiscal reporting based on international standards; see accompanying Selected Issues Paper).
The authorities indicated that the Abu Dhabi medium-term budget framework, prepared under the
7

Staff estimates using two alternative models suggest that current account balances in 2015 and the medium term
are lower than the levels consistent with fundamentals (Annex III). The projected current account balance is slightly
below the norm implied by the external sustainability approach—pointing to the need to generate more savings to
support future generations once hydrocarbon resources are exhausted, consistent with fiscal consolidation. The
macro-balance approach also indicates that the projected current account balance in 2015 is lower than the
equilibrium level implied by a range of structural and policy variables. External buffers in the form of international
reserves and sovereign wealth fund assets are ample.

Abu Dhabi Comprehensive Financial Plan (ADCFP) has been submitted to the Executive Council of
Abu Dhabi for approval. Staff welcomed this step and urged the authorities to approve and
operationalize the ADCFP swiftly, while integrating it fully in the annual budget process.

B. Safeguarding Financial Stability and Fostering Deepening
15.
The banking sector is well capitalized and liquid, and could withstand severe shocks.
The authorities noted that lower oil prices have not had a significant impact on banks so far,
although it was acknowledged that deposit and credit growth has slowed down. However, lower oil
prices and a higher dollar or real interest rates could have negative effects on nonhydrocarbon
growth and real estate prices, which could in turn affect the asset quality of banks. Staff estimates of
a vector autoregression model with oil price changes, nonhydrocarbon GDP growth, and NPL
changes indicate that the effect of lower oil prices on NPLs has been small, in line with the estimated
effects of expansionary fiscal policy (Annex IV). A severe stress test, with a sharp contraction in
nonhydrocarbon GDP and real estate prices, was conducted by the CBU (Box 3). It shows that the
banking sector would generally remain well capitalized and only four out of 22 banks would have
lower than the 12 percent minimum regulatory requirement. Measures have already been taken to
increase capital for two of these banks. Similar actions need to be taken for the remaining
institutions. Regarding liquidity, stress tests showed that four banks would be below the minimum
100 percent Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). Therefore, the central bank should encourage these
banks to change their liquidity profile in order to comply with the minimum 100 percent LCR.
16.
The CBU has engaged in an ambitious reform program to strengthen its banking
regulatory and supervisory framework. The CBU is reviewing banking regulation and supervision
with the aim to modernize its framework in line with international best practice. In this context, the
CBU is advised to timely implement its plans to phase in Basel III capital and liquidity standards over
2015-19. In this regard, the CBU has recently issued new regulation to strengthen liquidity
requirements to move towards the Basel III liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). The authorities noted that
most banks would comply with a simple liquid asset ratio and Basel III capital standards. Considering
the high concentration in the banking sector, this framework should also include capital surcharges
for domestically systemically important banks (D-SIBs). Moreover, the CBU should continue to
strengthen its risk-based supervision, initially focusing on systemically important banks. In addition,
compliance by banks with the loan concentration limits for GREs and local governments should be
monitored, including the planned transition paths for banks exceeding the limits, and no exemption
should be granted to ensure a level playing field and regulatory discipline across banks. The
authorities stressed that they have a no-exemption policy, holding banks accountable for all
regulations.

implying a total increase in PDs by six times at end-2017.
Only a few medium and small banks would be adversely affected as a result of the initial high CARs and low
NPL ratios in the banking system. The stress test reveals that the average CAR would decline from 18.1 percent to
14.8 percent under the downturn scenario. However, the capital of four banks would be below the 12 percent
minimum CAR, with a capital shortfall of AED 5.3 billion. This limited impact resulted from low NPL ratios and high
CARs in the banking system at end-2014. One medium bank has already obtained approval to raise its capital by
AED 4.9 billion, and a request is under consideration to increase the capital of a second bank by AED 3 billion. The
CARs could still be adversely affected by risks arising from single-name concentrations and second-round effects
between bank asset quality and macroeconomic conditions. Also, a higher LGD than observed during major debt
GRE and corporate restructurings following the 2008–09 crisis could also lead to larger capital shortfalls.
Liquidity Risk Stress Testing
The CBU also conducted liquidity stress test based on
the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) methodology. The
LCR aims to ensure that banks hold enough high-quality
liquid assets that can be converted into cash to meet
obligations for a 30 day-period under a stress scenario.
Overall, haircuts on assets reflect their liquidity while the
run-off rates on deposits and other liabilities are
assumptions on their likely withdrawal. The LCR stress
test included a baseline and an adverse scenario with
additional 5-10 percent haircut on high-quality liquid
assets on average and an additional 5 percent run-off
rate on stable deposits on top of the LCR assumptions.

Most banks pass the minimum 100 percent LCR even under the adverse scenario. The overall LCR would
decline from 170 percent under the LCR baseline to 157 percent under the adverse LCR scenario. However, four
banks (2 small and 2 mid-size banks) would be below the minimum 100 percent LCR under both the baseline and
adverse LCR scenarios. The liquidity gap would be about AED 3.2 billion. The four banks would need to change their
liquidity profile to comply with the minimum 100 percent LCR. The phase-in introduction of the LCR with a
60 percent requirement in 2015 provides banks with a schedule to adjust to the 100 percent requirement by 2019.

17.
In the medium term under an improved supervisory framework, safety nets and
resolution frameworks should be strengthened. The bank resolution framework should be
developed, in line with the Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions,
such as strengthening the resolution powers of the central bank by designating it as the lead
resolution authority for banks and their subsidiaries, and equipping it with robust tools. As part of
the resolution framework, a deposit insurance scheme should be put in place. The authorities
informed staff that they are studying other countries’ experience.
18.
Increased importance of Islamic finance calls for addressing specific financial stability
aspects. Rapid growth of Islamic banking over the past decade has led to an increase of its share in
total assets to 17 percent and in deposits to 19 percent (Annex V). Therefore, it is important to tailor
the regulatory and supervisory frameworks to adequately address Islamic banks’ specific risks,
including profit-sharing investment accounts and Shari'ah governance, as well as to continue
developing Shari'ah-compliant liquidity management instruments that would enable Islamic banks
to conduct robust liquidity management. Authorities stressed that the regulatory and supervisory
frameworks do not differentiate between Islamic and conventional banks, but work is ongoing to
review these frameworks and address Islamic banks’ specificities.
19.
The introduction of macroprudential measures helped address real estate market risks,
but the establishment of a full-fledged policy framework is warranted. The maximum loan-tovalue ratios (LTV) for mortgages and debt-service-to-income limits (DSTI) have helped limit the
systemic risk arising from real estate price speculation, and should remain in place as the market is
stabilizing and does not threaten financial stability. The central bank plans to introduce capital and
liquidity macroprudential tools and to publish a financial stability report on a regular basis. However,
currently there is no formalized macroprudential policy framework. Authorities and staff agreed that
a macroprudential framework should be developed in line with best practices In particular, an
improved system would involve a review of the central bank law to formalize a financial stability
mandate and cement the use of a broad range of macroprudential instruments (including the Basel
III counter-cyclical buffer); the establishment of a Financial Stability Committee at the central bank
level; and the institutionalization of the coordination with the Ministry of Finance and other relevant
agencies.
20.
GREs should continue to be strengthened to reduce macro-financial vulnerabilities. As
some GREs are highly indebted, it will be important to continue managing upcoming debt
repayments proactively, including using timely communication to guide market expectations. The
authorities noted that the GREs have been proactive in managing debt repayments. Improvements
in GRE risk management, reporting, and governance will be important to facilitate their further
strengthening. A transfer of maturing debt by GREs to domestic banks should be avoided to
preserve banking sector stability, while raising risk-weights to GRE lending could make such transfer
costly to banks. The authorities indicated that those GREs that are listed disclose their financials in
the annual reports. Staff recommended that the Dubai government collect and publish information
on Dubai GRE debt.

21.
Developing domestic debt markets would reduce the reliance of the government,
GREs, and private companies on external funding and bank lending. It would also provide
adequate instruments for banks’ liquidity management under the recently issued Basel III liquidity
rules. Authorities are encouraged to pass the draft Public Debt Law, which would allow the central
government to issue debt and provide a yield curve that could be used as a benchmark by the
private sector. Stepping up securities issuance by Emirates’ governments would also help deepen
the domestic market. Moving ahead with the adoption of a trust law would facilitate Sukuk issuance.
The authorities indicated that they plan to push ahead with developing the domestic debt market
and to establish a benchmark yield curve.
22.
Progress in strengthening the effectiveness of the anti money laundering and
combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regime should be pursued. The recent revision
of the AML/CFT Law and the approval of the executive by-laws are welcome. The authorities should
bring forward their plan to conduct a national risk assessment, and continue strengthening the risk
based supervision of financial and nonfinancial businesses and professions to ensure that they
adequately apply preventive measures commensurate with their risks including identification of
beneficial owners and reporting of suspicious transactions. To complement these measures, the
authorities should also seek a better understanding of the origins and intended use of financial
flows. These efforts combined with an enhanced dialogue with foreign regulators and other
stakeholders should contribute to preventing de-risking by correspondent banks that could
potentially divert remittances to informal channels and impact adversely financial inclusion.

C. Further Diversifying Sources of Inclusive Growth
23.
UAE ranks favorably on competitiveness indicators, but there is scope for
improvement, particularly in labor market efficiency. The authorities noted that a new law on
FDI, currently under drafting, would allow 100 percent foreign ownership for specific sectors outside
free zones to be defined by the government. Staff recommended that efforts to further strengthen
the business environment, particularly in the area of enforcing contracts and resolving insolvency,
should continue. Also, transitioning toward a knowledge-driven economy as envisaged by the
authorities, through better quality of education, and promotion of innovation and use of new
technologies would contribute to raising productivity and diversifying the economy. Implementing
labor market reforms to incentivize private sector employment of nationals is also important. In that
regard, reduced attractiveness of public-sector employment, better skills-jobs match and promotion
of entrepreneurship will be critical to private sector-led job creation for nationals. Significant
improvements in labor market statistics are required for accurate assessment and policy
recommendations.
24.
Enhancing SME access to credit is critical to spur inclusive growth. Progress has been
achieved in reducing impediments for SME finance by issuing a new law on SMEs and establishing
financial infrastructure such as a credit bureau and credit registry. Other initiatives were undertaken
such as setting aside public funds to facilitate SMEs access to finance, fostering financial literacy and
helping incubate businesses. Authorities should strengthen the financial infrastructure such as credit

17

assessment tools and creditors’ rights; the latter could be improved by the adoption of the
insolvency law. At the same time, the efficiency of public spending in this area could be increased by
separating development and financing functions, and focusing on providing seed money for
startups or guarantees for SMEs to ease access to finance (see accompanying Selected Issues Paper).

STAFF APPRAISAL
25.
Lower oil prices have increased macro-financial stability risks. Prudent economic
policies, progress in economic diversification, and the safe-haven status of the UAE have helped
build large fiscal and external buffers and strengthen the resilience of the economy. Also, the
implementation of megaprojects and private investment in the run-up to Expo 2020 are expected to
support activity over the medium term. However, lower oil prices are eroding fiscal and external
surpluses, and going forward a hike in the US interest rate could lead to a tightening of financial
conditions. These risks could be exacerbated by high volatility in stock markets, high NPLs, and low
banking system liquidity if government and GREs withdraw deposits.
26.
The macroeconomic policy mix should focus on gradual fiscal consolidation, while
maintaining the peg and easing liquidity management if needed. The authorities’ plan to
consolidate the fiscal position is appropriate, and would reduce fiscal vulnerability and ensure
intergenerational equity. Fiscal consolidation will also help bring the external position closer to the
level consistent with medium-term fundamentals. However, its pace should take into account the
available fiscal buffers and the impact on the broad economy. The authorities’ monetary policy
framework which aims to maintain the peg while strengthening liquidity management and
deepening money markets, is appropriate. In an adverse scenario with a decline in deposits, liquidity
management could be eased to support credit growth. Government deficit financing should avoid a
tightening in liquidity in the banking system.
27.
Fiscal consolidation requires rationalization of spending, but the quality of spending
cuts is crucial to avoid damaging the country’s competitiveness and long-term growth
prospects. Government investments should be preserved relative to nonhydrocarbon GDP to
support infrastructure, while the implementation of GRE megaprojects should be gradual, in line
with the expected demand. Public sector wage bill growth should be controlled while energy
subsidies and capital and other transfers should be reduced. Raising more nonhydrocarbon
revenues through new tax measures should also be considered. Fiscal policy implementation
requires further strengthening annual budget processes, including strong Public Finance
Management Systems, and integrating and operationalizing medium-term budget frameworks.
Close oversight and continued strengthening of debt management frameworks are crucial.
28.
Plans to strengthen the banking regulatory and supervisory framework by the CBU,
with no exemptions in holding banks accountable, are welcome. The banking sector is resilient
and has enough capital and liquidity buffers to withstand an adverse shock. The CBU plans to phase
in Basel III capital and liquidity standards over 2015-19 and to strengthen its risk-based supervision

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES

are welcome and should be timely implemented. As the corporate sector structure in the UAE is
characterized by large GREs and family groups, compliance by banks with the loan concentration
limits for GREs and local governments is challenging and should be monitored, including the
planned transition paths for banks exceeding the limits with no-exemption. Developing domestic
debt markets would reduce the reliance on external funding and bank lending, helping banks
comply with loan concentration limits. Over the medium term, the authorities should consider
developing resolution frameworks, and establishing deposit insurance mechanisms. Efforts on
strengthening the AML/CFT framework should continue.
29.
Authorities should strengthen their macroprudential framework, building on their
successful implementation of real estate-specific measures. Macroprudential policies such as
maximum LTVs for mortgages and DSTI limits help reduce excessive exposures by the banking
system associated with systemic risk. However, the current macroprudential policy framework needs
to be strengthened in line with best practices such as formalizing a financial stability mandate in the
central bank law, establishing a Financial Stability Committee at the central bank level, and
institutionalizing coordination with the Ministry of Finance and other relevance agencies. Continued
strengthening of GREs balance sheets and active management of their upcoming debt repayments,
while raising risk-weights of bank lending to GREs if needed, will be important in reducing macrofinancial vulnerabilities.
30.
Structural reforms should aim at further diversifying the economy and accelerating
private sector-led job creation for nationals. These could include: further opening up foreign
direct investment, improving selected areas of business environment, transitioning toward a
knowledge-based economy, easing access to finance for startups and SMEs, and creating the right
incentives for entrepreneurship and job creation.
31.
Staff encourages the authorities to build on recent progress in improving statistics.
Staff welcomes efforts in implementing an inter-agency project to compile the International
Investment Position, which will close an important statistical gap, including for the reporting of
foreign assets and debt. It will be important to press ahead with this project and provide adequate
resources for improving the quality of overall balance of payments statistics. It will also be essential
to develop more comprehensive demographic and labor markets statistics, while disseminating
complete data on Dubai GRE debt.
32.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12month cycle.

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES

Annex I. United Arab Emirates: Long-term Fiscal Sustainability Analysis
Staff analysis based on the permanent income hypothesis suggests that under conservative
baseline assumptions the government does not save its exhaustible oil revenue sufficiently
for future generations, but favorable persistent shocks could imply a smaller gap.1 The gap
between the projected deficits and the deficits consistent with a constant real per capita annuity is
11 percent of nonhydrocarbon GDP in 2014 (see chart). With fiscal consolidation assumed in the
baseline, the gap is projected to almost disappear by 2020. If beyond the forecast period,
consolidation continues in the same pace as envisaged for 2020 under the baseline, the fiscal stance
would be fully consistent with intergenerational equity by 2022. Another approach in estimating
annuity would yield different results: the constant real annuity rule would imply a negative gap of
9 percent of nonhydrocarbon GDP in 2020. Both types of annuities are used in the literature.2

Long-term sustainability assumes intergenerational equity by calculating a constant real per capita government
spending path (and related nonhydrocarbon deficit) that delivers a constant real per capita annuity to finance
government spending after hydrocarbon revenues are exhausted. Projections until 2020 are based on staff’s
macroframework, including the WEO assumptions about the oil price. After 2020, the baseline scenario assumes flat
hydrocarbon production and annual oil price growth of 2 percent, inflation growth of 2 percent, population growth
of 1.5 percent, and real return on assets of 4 percent. Alternative scenarios assume: (i) lower population growth by
0.5 percentage point; (ii) lower real return on assets by 1 percentage point; (iii) lower oil price by $10 in 2015–20 and
to remain constant thereafter; and (iv) higher oil price by $10 in 2015-20 and to increase by 2 percent per annum in
nominal terms thereafter.

1/ Based on available data.
2/ Abu Dhabi's Long-term bond spread over U.S. bonds. 5Y CDS is also related to the Emirate of Abu Dhabi.
3/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
4/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
5/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
6/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
7/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
Also indicates that public debt increases by more than the borrowing requirement.
8/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

3/ This scenario combines the oil price and the GRE contingent liability scenarios.

Source: IMF staff.

Fiscal Risks Captured by the Alternative Scenarios


Lower oil prices. An illustrative drop in oil prices by $10 a barrel would put the gross debt ratio
on an upward path. The primary balance would deteriorate to 3.5 percent of GDP in 2020, with
government debt rising to 24 percent of GDP.



GRE contingent liability. The scenario assumes that the government gradually takes over 20
percent of GRE debt (in 2016-20). The primary balance deteriorates to 4.8 percent of GDP in
2020, with government debt increasing to 18 percent of GDP.



Combined scenario. This scenario combines the oil price and GRE contingent liability scenarios.
The primary balance would deteriorate to 2.4 percent of GDP in 2020, with debt rising to 31
percent of GDP.

Dubai Government’s Debt Sustainability
While Dubai’s government debt sustainability has improved, it could rise rapidly under severe
shocks:


A sharp decline in GDP growth in 2015 (by ¾ of standard deviation from the baseline) and a
gradual recovery in 2016–20 would raise the debt-to-GDP ratio by about 6 percentage points in
2020 compared to the baseline.



Under a severe global downturn scenario, which assumes a real GDP shock, lower real interest
rates, and deterioration in the primary balance in the medium term, Dubai’s government debt
would increase to about 32 percent of GDP in 2020.



A scenario that combines a global downturn with a real estate shock, under which the
government would take over 20 percent of the GREs’ total debt in the medium term, would
imply a substantial increase in the government debt-to-GDP ratio, to about 54 percent, more
than twice as large as under the baseline.

Annex III. United Arab Emirates: External Sector Assessment
Staff believes the peg to the U.S. dollar serves the UAE well. Estimates from the external sustainability
approach suggest that the current account balances in 2015 and the medium term are slightly lower
than the levels consistent with fundamentals. These results largely reflect suboptimal saving of
exhaustible hydrocarbon revenues for future generations. Fiscal adjustment planned by the authorities
in 2015-20 and beyond will bring the current account back in line with fundamentals. External buffers
are ample.
The current account surplus in 2014 declined due to lower oil prices, and the UAE’s exchange
rate appreciated in line with the U.S. dollar. With a large drop in oil prices, the current account
surplus declined to 14 percent of GDP, from 18 percent in 2013, and is projected to decline
significantly further going forward (to about 6 percent of GDP on average in 2015-20). The dirham
has appreciated by 13 percent in Q1 2015 year-on-year in real effective terms, reflecting the real
effective appreciation of the U.S. dollar, but moving counter to what would have been desirable in
the face of the oil price shock. The terms of trade fell by 8 percent in 2014 and are projected to
decline by 19 percent this year.

1/ For the UAE, non-oil exports and imports exclude re-exports.

Non-oil trade volumes have so far been stable. Limited import substitution, reliance on
hydrocarbon exports priced in U.S. dollars, and flexible use of foreign workers who are paid wages

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES

set internationally limit the scope for the exchange rate to affect trade volumes. Nonhydrocarbon
exports as a share of nonhydrocarbon GDP have significantly increased over the past years.
Capital flows to the UAE have remained resilient in the presence of lower oil prices. FDI annual
inflows have been stable at about 4 percent of nonhydrocarbon GDP over the last years.
International bond issuance stood at $19 billion in 2014, up 16 percent from 2013. Issuance has
accelerated strongly in 2015, reaching $8 billion year-to-date in April, which represents a 65 percent
year-over-year increase. Although international banks reduced exposures to non-bank borrowers in
Q4 2014, total credit to the UAE’s non-bank sector increased by $1 billion in 2014.
The external sustainability (ES) approach suggests that the current account balances are too
low to generate an equitable amount of savings to support future generations once
hydrocarbon resources are exhausted, although the results are sensitive to the choice of annuity
and the assumptions made.1 Since external imbalances in the UAE stem largely from the
government sector, adjustment should occur through fiscal consolidation rather than exchange rate
devaluation.


The ES approach is based on the permanent income hypothesis model and is the preferred
method for the UAE because a current account gap according to the model would reflect
suboptimal saving of hydrocarbon revenues. The results are sensitive to the assumptions made
for oil prices, return on assets, and population growth.2



The implied norm estimated by this method for 2014 (based on the constant real per capita
annuity) is slightly higher than the current account surplus of 14 percent of GDP. The model
permits consumption smoothing during periods of oil price volatility and thus reduces the
required norm in line with projected oil prices in the medium term. Therefore, the norm declines
to 6-8 percent of GDP in the medium term, and is estimated to be slightly higher than the
projected current account balance: the gap will be less than 2 percent in 2015–20. Under the
constant real annuity rule, the implied norm is lower by 7 to 12 percent of GDP than the
projected surplus in the medium term.Under the constant real annuity rule, the implied norm is
lower by 7 to 12 percent of GDP than the projected surplus in the medium term.3

The approach calculates the current account required for the net present value (NPV) of hydrocarbon and
investment income to equal the NPV of imports net of nonhydrocarbon exports. To support intergenerational equity,
the economy would then choose a path for imports, and hence a current account norm, by accumulating net foreign
assets at an appropriate pace.

Projections until 2020 are based on staff’s macroframework, including the WEO assumptions about the oil price.
After 2020, the baseline scenario assumes flat hydrocarbon production and annual oil price growth of 2 percent,
inflation of 2 percent, population growth of 1.5 percent, and real return on assets of 4 percent. Alternative scenarios
assume: (i) lower population growth by 0.5 percentage point; (ii) lower real return on assets by 1 percentage point;
(iii) lower oil price by $10 in 2015-20 and to remain constant thereafter; and (iv) higher oil price by $10 in 2015-20
and to increase by 2 percent annually thereafter.

As mentioned in Annex I, both types of annuities are used in the literature; see Bems, R., and I. de Carvalho Filho,

The macro-balance approach implies a larger gap between the current account balance and
the norm in 2015.


This approach uses regression analysis for a broad cross-section of countries to predict the
equilibrium current account consistent with a range of structural and policy variables, and
estimates the impact of changes in variables on the norm.4 The model’s predicted value for 2014
is 9½ percent of GDP based on actual policies. Imposing fiscal policy consistent with
intergenerational equity raises the norm by 3 percent, while allowing for 2014 estimates of
global policy gaps reduces it by 1 percentage points, resulting in a norm of 11½ percent, which
is slightly lower than the 2014 current account balance. For 2015, the norm—which is based on
the optimal fiscal policy projected for 2020—declines to 8 percent of GDP, or 3 percentage
points higher than the projected current account balance.



The external sustainability approach is the preferred method for the UAE as indicated above. The
EBA-Lite model is estimated on a wide group of countries with very different characteristics and
therefore may not accurately capture the features of undiversified hydrocarbon exporters—
despite the inclusion of some hydrocarbon-related variables—such as the need for
intergenerational savings because oil resources are non-renewable.

External buffers, defined as central bank reserves plus estimated sovereign wealth fund
assets, significantly exceed standard adequacy levels from a precautionary perspective. At
US$72 billion (2015 projection), central bank reserves cover 4 months of imports (net of re-exports),
70 percent of short-term debt, and 21 percent of broad money. Combined with estimated assets in
sovereign wealth funds, which are mandated to make resources available in case of need, the buffers
are well above the range recommended by the Fund’s reserve adequacy metric.5

This approach employs the External Balance Assessment – Lite (EBA-Lite) model.

Annex IV. United Arab Emirates: Oil and Macro-Financial Linkages—A VAR Analysis
The vulnerability of the UAE economy to lower oil prices and higher US interest rates depends
on the sectoral linkages. The hydrocarbon sector represents 40 percent of the UAE GDP, with nonhydrocarbon output also heavily reliant on hydrocarbon revenues via current and capital spending.
Non-hydrocarbon industrial activities are commonly energy intensive and resource related (metals,
petrochemicals, and construction), while services (retail, restaurants, transport, communication, and
social services) are heavily driven by government spending financed by hydrocarbon revenues.1
Bank credit is driven by government current and capital spending and hydrocarbon
developments. Fiscal spending on infrastructure and investment projects fuels bank credit to
public sector entities or private contractors. Bank credit for personal lending (including mortgage
and consumer loans) is importantly driven by public sector wages as banks are able to deduct loan
payments directly from government employees’ paychecks. In addition, public sector deposits are a
cheap source of funding. As a result, any decline in oil prices and revenues has an impact on the
banking system.
To assess the vulnerability of the UAE economy to lower oil prices, a three-variable VAR
including the oil price (Brent crude), non-hydrocarbon GDP, and non-performing loans (as a
percentage of gross loans) as dependent variables is estimated, where NPL is a proxy for the
average probability of default. As the sample size is small (annual data during 1993–2014), no
other variables were included in the VAR with one lag. As a result, important transmission
mechanisms of oil prices shocks could be missing in the analysis. Oil price and non-hydrocarbon
GDP are log-differenced while NPLs are a simply differenced and the estimated coefficients can be
interpreted as either elasticities for oil price and non-hydrocarbon GDP or semi-elasticities for NPLs.
A separate VAR to assess the impact of higher US rates on the UAE banking system will be
estimated and included.
Oil prices and non-oil GDP are key drivers of
NPLs. The variables were ordered according to
their degree of independence so as to be able
to structurally identify the VAR through a
standard Choleski decomposition. The oil price
is considered the most exogenous variable,
followed by non-hydrocarbon GDP and NPLs.
The Table and the Figure provide, respectively,
the elasticities and impulse-response
coefficients when error terms are shocked with
one-standard deviation shocks (accumulated).
As expected, preliminary results indicate that

lower oil prices reduce non-oil GDP (elasticity of 0.057) and increase NPLs (semi-elasticity of -0.014)
over a year. On impact, negative feedback loops between NPLs and non-oil GDP can also develop.
However, after 3 years, the response of non-oil GDP to an increase in NPLs is not statistically
significant, which could be attributed to the intervention of UAE authorities to strengthen the
banking system. The response of NPLs to non-oil growth on the other hand intensifies after 3 years.

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES

Annex V. United Arab Emirates: Islamic Finance—Growth and Challenges
Islamic finance continues to grow rapidly in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Islamic assets
have grown by about 13 percent annually for the past five years.1 The system is bank-dominated
and Islamic banks (IBs) assets reached 17 percent of the total banking sector assets (corresponding
to US$107 billion), 19 percent of total deposits, and 18 percent of total financing by end-2014. Two
banks account for almost 65 percent of total Islamic assets and could be considered systemically
important, with 5.3 percent and 5.1 percent of the total banking sector assets, respectively. Issuance
of the Islamic debt instrument, sukuk, is also on the rise and the outstanding amount reached
US$5.4 billion as of end-2014.
Similar to conventional banks (CBs), IBs’ balance sheets are comprised mostly of short-term
loans that are funded mainly by deposits. The role of debt instruments and foreign liabilities as a
source of funding is still limited. However, there are slight deviations between the IBs’ and CBs’
balance sheet metrics, such as equity to assets, deposits, and short-term funding to assets, although
it is notable that the share of loans in total assets in IBs is lower than that of CBs by 10 percent (see
table).

IBs’ soundness has improved in 2014, but remain below those of CBs. IBs are relatively well
capitalized and the capital adequacy ratio (CAR) averaged 14.9 percent, although it is considerably
lower than that of CBs. The NPLs ratio to total loans stabilized around 7.9 percent in 2014, which is
relatively higher than for CBs. IBs’ profitability, in terms of return on equity (ROE) and return on

assets (ROA), stood at comfortable levels at 13.3 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively. Furthermore,
IBs’ liquidity has increased to 17.8 percent in 2014, although it is slightly lower than that of CBs.
While growing fast, regulators need to adequately address IBs specific risks in order to
maintain financial soundness. Due to its unique business model, IBs are highly exposed to specific
risks, mainly liquidity, concentration, Shari’ah compliance, displaced commercial,2 and investment
risks.


Regulatory and supervisory regime. While there is a law on Islamic banking, there is no specific
supervisory regime for IBs. A tailor-made regulation and risk-based supervision are warranted in
order to capture the specific risks, mentioned above, embedded in IBs. Islamic windows are
currently operating in a strict conventional regulatory framework. A targeting oversight is
justified to reduce the risks specific to Islamic products and to ensure adequate consumer
protection.



Shari’ah compliance risk. To mitigate such a risk, each individual bank’s Shari’ah Board should be
strengthened further by enforcing its independence, transparency, accountability, and its
members could be subject to “fit and proper” requirement. In addition, to further harmonize the
features of Islamic products and ensure consistency across institutions, the authorities should
accelerate the establishment of a National Shari’ah Board with the mandate to provide binding
interpretation and fatwa on Islamic financial products.



Governance structure. It is advisable to develop a tailor-made governance structure of IBs, which
is aimed at enhancing transparency and actively involving investment depositors in the decision
making, including in the allocation of funds and redistribution of profit.



Specific macroprudential regime. The central bank may consider defining tailor-made
macroprudential tools to address IBs liquidity and investment risks. In particular, new specific
reporting requirements should be introduced that are aimed at enabling IBs to develop robust
liquidity management. For instance, the mudaraba deposits directed toward specific investments
and as a balance sheet item might be excluded from the new liquidity ratio to be effectively
implemented in 2015. Similarly, this instrument should be included in the definition of Net Stable
Funding Ratio (NSFR), to come into effect on January 2018.



Safety nets and bank resolution. There is no formal bank resolution framework, including deposit
guarantee scheme. During the financial crisis in September 2008, the central bank introduced
the Liquidity Support Facility (LSF) to banks facing a shortfall in liquidity against their loan
portfolio. Recently, the central bank issued an Interim Marginal Lending Facility (IMLF) to
provide liquidity overnight against collateral. As of April 2015, the central bank has extended the
spectrum of eligible collateral to include Shari’ah-compliant securities other than CDs. The CB
should consider establishing explicit safety nets and banking resolution for the system as a
whole, taking also into account Islamic finance specificities.

2

While competing with CBs, IBs might be forced to forego part of their profits to pay comparable rates of return to
their clients, or to avoid subjecting their depositors to having to bear losses when the return on underlying assets
falls short.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of June 2015)
Technical cooperation between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the Bank began in 1980, starting
with two studies: a comprehensive national health assessment study and a government computer
center restructuring study. Later, the Government requested assistance in agriculture and water
resource management, including environmental impact assessments. Cooperation has been modest
during the past five years and included assistance in debt market development (2008) and in labor
market development (2011).
More recently, the Bank has supported efforts by the Ministry of Finance to enhance the efficiency
and effectiveness of public resource utilization the health, education, and infrastructure sectors. The
Bank also helped assess the financial implications of various health insurance schemes and
supported the establishment of a Tax Information Exchange Unit. Dialogue is now underway with
the Ministry of Finance for possible support to fiscal coordination across Emirates, and for further
develop public finance management systems.
The Bank has also delivered technical assistance to individual Emirates.


Abu Dhabi: The Bank assisted with development of food security programs and is helping
strengthen the institutional capacity and performance of the Judicial Department. Assistance will
start to the Department of Economic Development to increase reliance on knowledge in
economic activity.



Dubai: Assistance in the analysis of retirement planning options for expatriate workers was
delivered in 2012. The Bank also reviewed Dubai’s efforts to enhance private education
outcomes through an innovative, governance-based approach.



Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Ajman, and Ras AlKhaimah recently requested World Bank assistance to
enhance the business climate.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of June 2015)
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, but there are substantial shortcomings on
the dissemination of accounts of government-related entities (GREs). In particular, there is limited data on
GRE debt and contingent liabilities to the government. The federal and individual emirates’ agencies have
improved the availability and quality of the statistics, but more progress is needed. The adoption of the
Federal Statistics Law on May 18, 2009, and the establishment of an independent National Bureau of
Statistics (NBS) are important steps in establishing a statistical system at the federal level. While the Law
expressly requires all agencies and local statistical centers to provide data as required by the NBS, its
success will depend on implementing arrangements, staffing, funding and training.
National Accounts: The methodology broadly conforms to the 1968 SNA. GDP is compiled annually with
a lag of around 5 months. Some progress has been made in improving the source data but further work is
needed to improve updating procedures. Work is ongoing to compile quarterly national accounts.
Price statistics: Data are published with a delay of one month. Consumer price indexes and GDP deflators
need further harmonization at the federal level.
Government finance statistics: In 2011, GFSM 2001 was introduced by the federal and several emirate
governments, and the institutional arrangement to ensure adequate data provision was established. This
consolidation should complement initiatives to establish debt management units at both the emirate and
federal levels. The UAE submitted its fiscal accounts to the GFS Yearbook for the first time in 2012.
Monetary statistics: The central bank has shifted the responsibility for compiling and disseminating
monetary data to the Banking Supervision Department, in order to improve the timeliness of data to
monthly frequency with less than a month lag. Although some monetary aggregates and FSIs are already
published on a monthly basis, the Banking Supervision Department has not been trained in MFSM 2000
and the published data do not follow the recommended methodology. An STA mission will visit the UAE in
March 2016 to support the authorities in strengthening their monetary and financial statistics.
Balance of Payments: The information needed to compile the balance of payments is insufficient,
especially for the financial account. Many components of the IIP also are missing or incomplete, as the
data on government foreign assets and private holdings of foreign assets and liabilities are not published
or lack appropriate surveys. The development of a comprehensive BOP and IIP is however within the reach
of the UAE if the central bank, the NBS, and the Ministry of Economy strengthen their capacity and receive
appropriate support at the high level. The CBU has introduced an international transactions reporting
system to strengthen the quality of balance of payments statistics. The authorities continue a project to
compile the IIP, which will close an important statistical gap. An STA mission will visit the UAE in
September 2015 to support the authorities in progressing with strengthening their BOP/IIP.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Participant in the GDDS since July 31, 2008. The metadata were last updated in 2008 (Monetary and BOP),
2008 (National Accounts and Prices), and 2008 (Government Finance). No Data ROSC is available.
