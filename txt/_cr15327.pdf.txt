IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Kuwait
On November 25, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Kuwait.
The decline in oil prices has adversely affected Kuwait’s fiscal and current account balances and
slowed growth in 2014–15. With high financial buffers and substantial borrowing space, the
government can smooth the fiscal adjustment in response to the decline in oil prices, and
continue to support growth through sizable investment spending. Real non-oil GDP growth is
projected to slow in 2015 and 2016, and pick up to 4 percent in the medium term, supported by
government investment in infrastructure and private investment. Average inflation is projected
to increase to 3.4 percent in 2015 and will remain broadly stable at that level over the medium
term, given limited global inflation.
The fiscal and external positions are projected to deteriorate further in 2015 and 2016, and
improve somewhat over the medium term as oil prices and production recover partially. The oil
price decline has increased the urgency of diversifying the economy and creating high
productivity jobs is a priority to reduce Kuwait’s dual dependency on oil revenue and expatriate
workers. The government is focusing on reforms to contain current expenditure, prioritize capital
expenditure and pursue with policies aimed towards increasing the role of private sector
investment and job creation for nationals.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They noted that Kuwait’s large
fiscal and external buffers have cushioned the macroeconomic impact of the fall in oil prices and
will facilitate adjustment in the period ahead. Accordingly, Directors encouraged the authorities
to take advantage of the available policy space to pursue gradual, sustained reforms to safeguard
fiscal sustainability, promote export diversification, and boost private sector participation in the
economy.
Directors underscored the need for fiscal consolidation through higher non oil revenue
mobilization, expenditure restraint, and further subsidy and public sector wage reforms.
In particular, they supported the authorities’ plans to introduce a value-added tax and a business
profits tax. Directors also recommended combining domestic and external financing sources to
maintain capital spending and preserve the social safety net.
Directors agreed that the pegged exchange rate regime has served Kuwait well and delivered
monetary stability. While welcoming the general soundness of the banking system, they
encouraged the central bank to remain vigilant and develop its macroprudential policy
framework to further strengthen financial sector stability. Continued close oversight of nonbanks
should also remain on the policy agenda.
Directors stressed the critical importance of further promoting private employment for Kuwaiti
nationals to reduce demands on the budget and transform the country’s development model.
Accordingly, they recommended deeper labor market reforms as well as additional efforts to
modernize education and training. Directors also encouraged the authorities to implement further
reforms to diversify the economy by improving the business environment, stepping up
privatization, and strengthening governance.
Directors welcomed Kuwait’s progress in upgrading its regime against money laundering and the
financing of terrorism. They also commended efforts to improve the quality and availability of
key economic statistics.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

KUWAIT
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 4, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Context. With persistently lower oil revenues over the medium term, Kuwait is facing a more
challenging policy environment as it needs to adjust spending while continuing to diversify the
economy to create jobs for the growing young national population. Large financial buffers and
space to borrow provide cushion to smooth the adjustment, which the authorities have been
able to initiate by implementing diesel subsidy reforms. The 2015/16 budget appropriately
curtails current expenditure growth while increasing capital spending on infrastructure. The
new five-year Development Plan (DP) (2015–19) provides direction for prioritizing capital
expenditure, encouraging private investment and creating jobs for nationals in the private
sector.
Outlook and risks. Real non-oil GDP growth is projected to slow in 2015 and 2016
on account of slower consumption and private investment activity, and pick up to
3.5-4 percent in the medium term, supported by government investment in
infrastructure and private investment. The main downside risks to the outlook arise
from lower global oil demand and prices, slow implementation of the DP, and regional
geopolitical uncertainty.
Macroeconomic policies. The fiscal and external positions are projected to deteriorate
further in 2015 and 2016, and improve slightly over the medium term as oil prices and
production recover partially. The government needs to implement gradual but sustained
adjustment of current spending, and improve the efficiency of capital expenditure to
strengthen non-oil growth and ensure intergenerational equity. Monetary policy settings
and the peg to a basket of currencies remain appropriate for the Kuwaiti economy.
Financial sector. Banks are in a strong position to weather the challenges of lower oil
prices and slower growth. The Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK) has continued to strengthen
regulation and supervision of the banking system to safeguard financial stability.
Enhancing the macroprudential policy framework would underpin systemic stability as
economic activity moderates.
Economic diversification. Reforms are needed for improving the business environment,
governance indicators, and education and skills of nationals, and for creating the
appropriate incentive frameworks to increase employment of nationals in the private
sector.

CONTEXT
1.
Kuwait is facing the oil price shock from a position of strength. The decline in oil prices
has adversely affected Kuwait’s fiscal and current account balances and slowed growth in 2014/15.
With high financial buffers—estimated by staff at about 320 percent of GDP at end-2014—and
substantial borrowing space, the government intends to smooth the fiscal adjustment in response to
the decline in oil prices, and continue to support growth through large investment spending. The
authorities reduced current expenditure in 2015 including by partially abolishing diesel subsidies.
They are committed to continuing with subsidy reforms, and introducing corporate tax and wage
reforms, in a phased manner over the medium term.

Status of Staff Recommendations Made in the 2014 Article IV Consultation
Containing fiscal spending, in particular public wage
bill, and reallocating spending toward capital.

Phased removal of energy and electricity subsidies.

Introducing corporate tax for domestic companies.
Strengthen budget framework.

Establish a more formal macroprudential framework
and a coordinating mechanism to assess incipient risks.
Expand and refine macroprudential toolkit, strengthen
early warning system, and conduct macro stress tests
of banks.

Enhancing investment companies’ (ICs) resolution,
developing needed tools to do it, and coordinating
between CBK and CMA on ICs’ supervision.
Improving governance and auditing/reporting
standards for investment companies.
Improving liquidity management framework and
developing debt markets.
Developing the non-oil tradable sector and supporting
employment of nationals in the private sector.

Modernizing restructuring resolution.
Improving AML/CFT framework.

Public wage reform is under study. The government has reduced
allowances for government travel and overseas health expenses.
The DP (2015–19) has prioritized projects according to national
priorities. The 2015/16 budget envisages an increase in capital
expenditure. The government is embarking on public expenditure
management reform with World Bank technical assistance (TA).
The government eliminated diesel and kerosene subsidies
effective January 2015, and increased the price of aviation fuel. It
is currently undertaking an impact study for gasoline subsidy
reforms for phased implementation.
The government is considering a proposal for business profits tax
designed with the help of Fund TA.
In line with the recommendations of the Fund and the World Bank
TA, modernization of the tax administration system continues. The
macro-fiscal unit is operational with the support of the Fund
resident advisor. Fund TA has recommended a framework for
establishing a fiscal rule that is currently being studied by the
Ministry of Finance.
The CBK and other government agencies are working on
establishing a framework to deal with crisis management.
At the request of the authorities, Fund TA has focused on
expanding the macroprudential toolkit. Further TA is envisaged to
assist the central bank in enhancing systemic risk monitoring and
developing a deposit insurance mechanism. The CBK is
undertaking periodic macro stress tests of banks.
Coordination exists between CBK and Capital Markets Authority
(CMA), but there is no formal committee.
No change in the status regarding the implementation of the new
corporate governance guidelines with effect from June 2016.
The CBK is issuing Treasury Bills. The government is considering
among other options, issuing domestic debt to finance the fiscal
deficit .
Bye-laws for foreign investment and small and medium
enterprises (SMEs) and on the new Direct Investment Promotion
Law have been issued; the National Fund for SMEs Development
was established last year.
Bankruptcy law is still under preparation.
Kuwait was removed from the FATF list of countries with strategic
Anti Money laundering (AML)/Combating Financing of Terrorism
(CFT) deficiencies in February 2015.

RECENT ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
2.
The Economy continued to grow in 2014, albeit at a lower rate, reflecting some
slowdown in investment activity. The estimated slowdown in non-oil growth to 3.2 percent in
2014 and 3 percent in 2015 (4.2 percent

GDP growth to around zero in 2014–15.
Average inflation increased slightly to 3 percent in 2014, and edged up to 3.8 percent in August
2015, driven mainly by housing rents (Figure 1).
3.
Financial market conditions are subdued. Stock prices declined by about 24 percent y-o-y
at end-September 2015, reflecting global financial market volatility, and regional geopolitical and
domestic economic uncertainties. Corporate sector profitability remained stable in the first half of

appears to be softening, but there are no
signs yet of a correction trend. As of July 2015, prices across the residential and investment property
segments have seen average prices fall in year-on-year terms by 6 and 7 percent, respectively, while
prices in the commercial segment have increased by 5 percent.
4.
The banking sector is well regulated and has shown resilience to the oil price shock.
The sector had a capital adequacy ratio of 16.9 percent (Basel III definition), nonperforming loans
ratio of 2.8 percent, and provisioning ratio of 172 percent on a consolidated basis at end-June 2015.
Banks’ return on assets and equity increased, respectively, to 1.1 percent and 8.9 percent at endMarch 2015 (1.0 percent and 7.4 percent in 2013), reflecting lower provision expenses, and profit
growth of subsidiaries and branches abroad (Figure 3). The banking system’s exposure to

investment companies (ICs) diminished to 2.8 percent of banks’ total lending, amid ICs ongoing
downsizing of balance sheets (Figure 4).
5.
Lower oil revenue caused the fiscal and external positions to deteriorate sharply in
2014/15. In the government’s presentation, after mandatory transfers to the Future Generations
Fund (FGF) of 25 percent of total revenues, and excluding investment income, the fiscal balance
declined to a deficit of 4.4 percent of GDP in 2014/15 from a surplus of 11.7 percent in 2013/14.1
Under the IMF presentation, which does not take into account transfers to the FGF and includes
staff’s estimate of investment income, the overall fiscal balance also narrowed sharply to a surplus of
17.4 percent, compared to a surplus of 34.8 percent in 2013/14 (Figure 5). The government
increased diesel and kerosene prices and reduced subsidies on aviation fuel effective January 2015,
with estimated savings of 0.3 percent of GDP annually. The current account surplus fell to
31.2 percent of GDP in 2014 from 39.5 percent in 2013.2

Investment in infrastructure projects will support non-oil growth in the medium term.
A number of contracts have been awarded since 2014 in the oil sectors to upgrade fuel and to
increase refining capacity, and implementation is already underway in several key projects including
in the power generation and health sectors. The decline in oil price is, however, weighing on
confidence and could negatively affect private consumption and investment. Against this

financial risks from excessive credit expansion.3 Average oil production is projected to increase by
2 percent a year in the medium term, consistent with the planned new investment to increase crude
capacity. Overall, GDP growth will recover from 0.3 percent in 2015 to about 2.8 percent over the
medium term. Average inflation is projected to increase to 3.4 percent in 2015 and will remain
broadly stable at that level over the medium term, given limited global inflation. The authorities
agreed with staff’s assessment and projections.
7.
Growth prospects will hinge on efficient implementation of the Development Plan
2015–19 (Risk Assessment Matrix). The authorities noted that the improved relationship of the
administration with the parliament bodes well for the execution of the DP, which will also benefit
from the new public private partnership (PPP) law. Implementation of projects in the Plan is under
monthly monitoring at the cabinet level and periodic review by the parliament. Besides, the
authorities are monitoring payments to contractors to ensure that contracts are executed without
delays. Staff also noted potential risks to the authorities’ oil upstream and downstream expansion
strategy in view of the recent loss of market share, global developments and potential transitioning
of growth in China.4 The authorities anticipate a quick recovery of their market share through

Although the credit/GDP ratio rose by 5 percentage points over the year ending 2015Q2, that mostly represented a
recovery from weak credit growth in the past. As of end 2015Q2, the credit gap (deviation of credit/GDP ratio from
its backward-looking estimated trend) was about 1.1 percentage points.

The authorities have initiated an investment program to increase crude oil production capacity from 3 mbd
to 4 mbd by 2020, and expand the capacity of their refineries and the petrochemicals complex. The investment
program in the oil sector amounts to about KD27 billion during 2015–20 in upstream and downstream projects.

diversification of export destinations in Africa and South America, and increased exports to Europe
especially from clean refinery projects.
8.
Staff shared the authorities’ view that the peg to a basket remains appropriate for the
Kuwaiti economy, as it continues to provide a nominal anchor. The authorities are fully
committed to the current exchange rate regime. As of July 2015, the Kuwaiti dinar depreciated
against the U.S. dollar by about 6.8 percent (y-o-y), whereas the nominal effective exchange rate
appreciated by 3.1 percent during the same period. Staff’s external assessment suggests that under
current policies, the current account is weaker than the level consistent with fundamentals by about
11 percent of GDP. Under appropriate fiscal policies, which would entail achieving larger fiscal
surpluses, the gap would be closed over the medium term, and the current account balance would
strengthen to a level that is in line with fundamentals (Appendix II). Over the longer term, as the
economy diversifies, staff suggested that the benefits of exchange rate flexibility may increase,
which the authorities acknowledged.
9.
The fiscal balance based on the
authorities’ presentation is projected to
remain in deficit over the medium term.
Despite this accounting deficit, which will
cumulatively reach KD26.2 billion
(US$94 billion) and create financing needs
of similar amount during 2015–20, the
government will continue to accumulate
fiscal buffers of $35 billion during 2015-20,
as it adheres to the fiscal rule of
transferring 10 percent of total revenue to
the FGF and retaining investment income in
the fund. The fiscal stance, measured by the
non-oil primary balance as a share of nonoil GDP shows an improvement over the
medium term in the baseline as spending
growth is assumed to be contained to
about 5 percent annually.5 The sharp fiscal
consolidation in 2015 can be explained by
the normalization of one-off spending in
2014 and a decline in the subsidy bill.6

The baseline for 2015-20 is based on the approved 2015 budget and announced policies by the authorities to
contain the wage bill, cut non-essential spending, and includes saving in the subsidy bill as a result of the diesel
reform in 2014 and the decline in international prices. The baseline also assumes that project implementation under
the 2015-19 DP will improve compared to the previous plan.

projected to grow by 4 percent annually over the medium term.
10.
The authorities are considering debt financing of the budget deficit and are weighing
the pros and cons of various options to determine the optimal mix. Drawdown from the
General Reserve Fund (GRF), as was done in 2014/15, would be consistent with the GRF’s role as the
Treasurer as well as the stabilization fund. There may also be merit in issuing domestic debt, which
could help catalyze the development of a liquid local-currency debt market. However, any issuance
of domestic debt would need to consider the cost of debt relative to the expected risk and return on
the GRF, and more importantly, its impact on the central bank’s foreign exchange reserves, and the
capacity of the banking system to absorb government debt without crowding out private credit.
Depending on the rating and terms of borrowing, issuing foreign currency debt abroad could
constitute an additional option that would not affect central bank reserves. Staff favored a mix of
drawdown of buffers, and issuance of domestic and foreign debt to balance the tradeoffs between
costs and benefits. The government has requested TA on public debt management, which staff
supports.
11.
While banks have significant direct and indirect exposures to real estate and equity
markets, their high capital and provisioning buffers should enable them to withstand shocks.

stress tests show limited but non-trivial aggregate risks to corporate profitability from interest rate
shocks.7 Household investments in the local equity market would face adverse wealth effects from
the decline in stock prices. ICs, by the nature of their business model, would face valuation losses
from their investments in the local equity market.
12.
Stress tests conducted by staff suggest continued overall banking sector resilience. A
few banks, however, turn out to be more sensitive than others and could require additional capital
under severe stress scenarios (Box 1). Banks are subject to macroprudential regulation, particularly
with regard to their real estate and equity market exposures. Staff and the authorities agreed that
there is further scope to better identify and mitigate spillovers through the financial sector, and to
continue to build buffers of the banking system. Although the probability of realization of large
shocks is low, this calls for strengthening the resolution framework for banks, which is work-inprogress at the central bank. In addition, strengthening the macroprudential policy framework, and
refining the early warning system and toolkit, would enable a more systematic assessment and
prevention of systemic risk. In particular, focused attention on collation of real estate indicators is
warranted to monitor property market risks.
13.
A sustained decline in oil prices presents a major downside risk to the medium-term
outlook. Financial buffers could decline under adverse oil price scenarios. A lower oil price over the
medium term ($10 below WEO projections) would shift the overall fiscal surplus into deficit starting

In 2014, 68 (out of 130) companies accounting for 66 percent of the debt had ICR > 1 (i.e., companies that generate
operating profits larger than their interest payment commitments). A shock that increases the interest rate by
200 basis points (bps) reduces the number of firms with ICR > 1 to 57. A 500 bps interest shock reduces the number
firms with ICR > 1 to 52; these companies hold 50 percent of total debt.

on loan amount of KD70,000 with a maximum
tenor of 15 years. A capital risk weight of 100 percent also applies to installment loans. In November 2013, the CBK
introduced limits on the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for financing extended by banks, investment companies and
finance companies to individuals to purchase or develop residential property. An LTV limit of 50 percent applies to
the purchase of undeveloped land, 60 percent to the purchase of existing property and 70 percent to housing
construction in residential areas. The new regulation, however, is not applicable to unsecured installment loans used
to buy or renovate first homes. Effective December 2014, the CBK issued regulations to tighten the treatment of real
estate collateral by phasing out credit mitigation by 10 percent annually yearly over 5 years.

14.
Other downside risks include regional geopolitical uncertainty that could impact
growth prospects. Conflicts in the region could intensify further and worsen overall business
confidence. Additionally, the removal of sanctions on Iran’s oil exports could add downward
pressure to world oil prices, clouding the profitability of Kuwait’s investments being undertaken in
the oil sector. The authorities were optimistic that continued investments in mega projects would
help maintain confidence, crowd in private investments and preserve growth.

Box 2. Stress Testing the Kuwaiti Banking System to Oil-Macro Financial Shocks

available from 2000 to 2014. Results indicate that the
NPL ratio exhibits strong auto-correlation, with non-oil private sector growth, real equity prices growth and real
estate prices growth (investment) statistically significant and with the expected sign.
To test banks’ resilience, moderate and severe stress scenarios combining real and financial shocks were
considered. Staff’s sensitivity analysis is based on 2 scenarios from 2015 to 2017, characterizing moderate and
severe deterioration in combined growth, equity and real estate prices, based on historical lows in Kuwait.
Stress test results indicate that the banking system, overall, holds sufficient buffers to absorb losses under
severe macro scenarios. Overall, the combined capital of banks in the sample would remain above the central
bank’s regulatory prescribed minimum under the moderate scenario, with the NPL ratio rising to about 9.3 percent
and a capital adequacy ratio at 16.7 percent two years after the shock. However, under a severe stress scenario,
the capital of 5 out of 7 banks would fall below the prescribed regulatory minimum. The additional capital
requirements of the 5 banks would amount to KD1.26 billion in 2016. At an aggregate level, the capital adequacy
ratio would fall to 9.7 percent, below the regulatory minimum standard.

A. Fiscal Consolidation and Expenditure Composition

Staff and the authorities agreed that gradual and sustained fiscal adjustment should
commence without delay. The government’s high financial buffers and ample borrowing space will
enable it to comfortably finance the shortfall in the budget. Nevertheless, to maintain confidence in
the economy, preserve buffers, and reduce fiscal risks, fiscal adjustment plans should be

would require a larger adjustment in the
future, especially if oil prices fall further. For instance, if long-term oil prices were to decrease by
$10 below current levels in the medium term, the gap would rise to over 16 percent of GDP by 2020.
16.
In view of Kuwait’s large buffers, the authorities could choose a relatively long horizon
over which fiscal adjustment may be undertaken to mitigate the impact on growth. An
adjustment of 1 percent of GDP annually relative to the baseline over the medium term would be
appropriate and feasible (see next sections) to close the fiscal gap over a cycle of 10 years under
current oil price assumptions. Staff recommended to start the adjustment in 2016 and underscored
the importance of not only a gradual and sustained pace of adjustment, but also sequencing the
composition of fiscal consolidation to minimize its impact on growth.9 Staff and the authorities
agreed that a gradual path would help manage fiscal risks from further oil price decline, as well as
other social and political expectations.
17.
Staff and the authorities agreed that achieving fiscal sustainability will require
measures to contain expenditure growth and increase non-oil revenues. The savings from these
reforms, which include subsidy and wage reforms, and VAT and business profits tax, would be about

Intergenerational equity level of the non-oil primary fiscal deficit is derived from the permanent income hypothesis
which estimates a constant real per-capita annuity of the sum of discounted values of future oil revenue receipts and
financial assets. The calculations are sensitive to assumptions on future oil prices, population growth, inflation, and
discount rates. For further discussion, see Macroeconomic Policy Frameworks for Resource-Rich Developing
Countries; IMF Policy Paper; 2012.

Most studies, including those that focus on the GCC, find that the fiscal multiplier is larger for capital than current
spending and that tax multipliers are usually found to be smaller than spending multipliers particularly in the longerterm. See, for example, Espinoza and Senhadji, 2011, and Cerisola et al., 2015.

However, other factors such as
efficiency gains (which have not been included in the calculations) could offset the adverse impact
on growth. In addition, these reforms would bring additional benefits; for example, containing public
sector employment and future wage growth will support efforts to increase the employment of
nationals in the private sector and diversification efforts.

The government should take advantage of current low global energy prices to
strengthen efforts to reform domestic energy prices. A gradual reform of energy pricing (with
estimated fiscal/quasi-fiscal cost of 7.2 percent of GDP in 2015), accompanied by establishment of a
social safety net and other mitigating measures and a well-designed communication strategy to get
the buy-in of the middle class, would generate substantial savings. Staff’s analysis shows that in the
longer-term, energy price reform would benefit growth by increasing efficiency in the economy and
creating space for higher public and private investment (Box 3). One-off effects on inflation should
be manageable. Productive activities more sensitive to energy costs, particularly the transport sector,

Staff applied estimates of the multipliers that were recently used in an interdepartmental exercise to assess the
impact of additional fiscal adjustment on real non-oil growth at the GCC level: 0.4 for revenue and 0.6 for current
spending and assumed the multiplier impact is phased over three years.

would be able to adjust to higher energy prices more easily if the reform is gradual. The government
plans to introduce gasoline subsidy reforms by the end of this year. Reform of electricity and water
subsidies will require legal changes, which the government expects to introduce to parliament by
end-2015.
20.
Public wage reform should, among other things, cap annual salary increases at the
inflation rate and contain expansion in the wage bill. The government is considering a reform to
standardize the wage structure in the public sector and provide a framework to limit wage growth,
effective FY 2016/17. The initial cost of salary alignments will be about KD350 million (0.9 percent of
2016-GDP), while the saving would be backloaded. The government plans to approve the new civil
service law before end-2015 and spread out the initial cost over the next two years. The authorities
agreed with staff’s suggestion that in designing the reform they should consider clauses to limit
explicitly public employment growth and arbitrary increases in wages, and that they should should
be mindful of the impact of such a rule on the formation of inflation expectations in the economy.
Staff also suggested the inclusion of an escape clause to hold wage growth below inflation when
macroeconomic circumstances warrant.
21.
Efforts to raise non-hydrocarbon revenue need to commence. Introducing a business
profit tax (BPT) on the net profits of all companies operating in Kuwait and simplifying the current
tax structure would potentially increase revenues by KD500–800 million (1.3 to 2.1 percent of
2016-GDP). The authorities indicated that they expect to introduce a draft BPT law in the next
session of the parliament. Implementation of the value added tax (VAT), which is also being
discussed at the GCC–level, could yield an additional 1–2 percent of non-oil GDP. With the GCC
having recently approved a VAT framework, staff encouraged the authorities to move ahead
expeditiously with its implementation. The authorities indicated that they prefer to move in unison
with the rest of the GCC in introducing the VAT, but they would be prepared to move by themselves
if the coordination process becomes excessively prolonged.
22.
Staff welcomed the government’s decision to move to top-down budgeting beginning
FY 2016/17 and to a medium-term budgeting framework starting in fiscal year 2017/18. These
reforms, besides providing better oversight and discipline to the budget planning and execution
processes, would also build momentum to strengthen capital investment planning and prioritization
towards high-growth sectors. Moreover, an overall Public Financial Management Committee,
chaired by the Minister of Finance, has been established to guide and supervise public financial
management reforms. A decision has also been made for full roll-out and implementation of the
Government Financial Management Information System during FY 2016/17.

Box 3. Subsidy Reform in Kuwait: Long-Term Growth Benefits Outweigh
Short-Term Inflation Costs
Low domestic energy prices represent a significant cost for the Kuwaiti economy. Kuwait’s on-budget costs of low
energy prices (including water) were about KD3.7 billion (7.6 percent of GDP) in 2014; 35 percent corresponds to petroleum
products subsidies. The opportunity cost for selling energy products (gasoline, diesel, natural gas, and electricity) at prices
below international prices is estimated at $12.7 billion (7.4 percent of GDP) in 2014; lower energy prices in 2015 reduce the
1/
estimated cost to $9.3 billion (7.2 percent of GDP).
A number of countries in the MENA region have initiated energy price reforms. Qatar has increased gasoline prices;
Bahrain and Saudi Arabia have increased electricity tariffs for industries; Kuwait has increased diesel and kerosene prices and
is studying a proposal to increase electricity prices; Bahrain and Oman have increased natural gas prices for industrial users.
Most recently the UAE introduced a pricing mechanism for setting fuel prices against an international benchmark. Among
non-GCC energy exporters, Iran and Yemen, and among oil importers, Egypt, Jordan, Mauritania, Morocco, Sudan, and
Tunisia, have initiated subsidy reforms. Among energy exporting countries outside the MENA region, Malaysia, and Nigeria
are successful cases of energy price reforms.
The increase in diesel price in January 2015 does not appear to have impacted headline inflation. While assessing the
pass-through of diesel prices to headline inflation requires a more detailed and technical analysis, data as of May 2015
seems to suggest that the 100 percent diesel price increase in January 2015 has not had any significant impact on inflation
so far. Transport prices did not increase in January, fell in March, and increased slightly in May (0.16 percent). Headline
inflation during 2015 appears to follow the pattern observed during the second half of 2014.
The inflation response to previous domestic price shocks also permits to anticipate a modest impact on domestic
inflation if energy prices were raised in Kuwait. In particular, pass through from shocks to the CPI sub-indices to headline
inflation appears moderate.

Preliminary estimates suggest that in the long-term Kuwait could generate net permanent savings in the range of
2/
1.6–2.2 percent of GDP even if consumers are fully compensated for price increases. The estimate reflects opportunity
costs of 7.4 percent of GDP for subsidies on gasoline, diesel, electricity, and natural gas; price elasticity for energy
consumption in the range of (-0.3, -0.5); and assumes that energy prices are aligned with US pre-tax gasoline prices. If net
savings from the reform were invested, Kuwait GDP could further increase between 0.06 percent of GDP and 0.08 percent of
GDP. To the extent consumers are less than fully compensated, the fiscal gains from energy price reform could be even
larger.
____________________________
1/ The estimated opportunity cost uses as reference, gasoline and diesel US pre-tax prices published by the IEA, Henry Hub gas prices, and average electricity
tariff for all sectors published by the US EIA.
2/ Estimated net savings are equivalent to the deadweight loss —the loss for the society, from selling products in the domestic market at prices lower than world
prices, which lead to consumption levels that are higher than what would be at world prices in the context of a demand that responds negatively to prices.

B. Strengthening Financial Stability
23.
The CBK has strengthened regulations to safeguard financial stability. Banks are under
Basel III regulations for capital, including a framework for DSIBs, liquidity, and leverage. In the real
estate sector, banks are subject to loan-to-value (LTV) ratio since November 2013, to a segment of
individuals who purchase or develop residential property, besides debt-service-to-income ratio
(DSTI) that already existed.
24.
Macroprudential tools can help mitigate potential risks posed by banks’ high
exposures to the real estate sector. Some weakening of real estate activity appears underway in
the commercial and investment segments, but the residential real estate segment reportedly remains
firm. The latter is regulated by DSTI and maximum loan limits. While investment and commercial real
estate financing is less regulated, rules regarding the treatment of real estate collateral, which
encouraged this type of lending, are being phased out. The authorities agreed with staff’s views that
that it is important to ensure that macroprudential policy measures are reviewed constantly to
ensure that they do not exacerbate any property price correction, while preempting the buildup of
excessive risks related to real estate exposures. In addition, heightened supervisory vigilance needs
to be maintained to ensure that real estate exposures are appropriately classified and adequately
provisioned. Staff encouraged the authorities to construct real estate indices and suggested that
other indicators, such as both the average and distribution of LTV and DSTI ratios, be compiled to
calibrate measures at different phases of the credit cycle.
25.
Given ICs’ interconnectedness to the rest of the financial system, close monitoring of
their activities, strengthened regulatory oversight, and further consolidation to strengthen
this sector are warranted. A formal macroprudential coordination mechanism encompassing
nonbank financial institutions would facilitate more systematic identification of systemic risks.
Key improvements would involve: (i) assigning a macroprudential policy mandate and a delineation
of its powers; (ii) establishing a formal financial stability coordination committee headed by the
central bank, comprised of all financial system regulators, including the capital markets authority, the
insurance supervisor, and the Ministry of Finance; (iii) ensuring appropriate accountability
mechanisms; and (iv) elevating to a legal requirement the exchange of information.
26.
Efforts to implement and further strengthen the AML/CFT and anticorruption
frameworks in Kuwait are continuing. The decision by FATF in February 2015 to remove Kuwait
from the list of countries subject to its monitoring process under its ongoing global AML/CFT
compliance process and the issuance of the bylaws in March 2015 for the Anti Corruption Authority
are welcome developments. Going forward, staff encouraged the authorities to build on these
efforts, including through enhancing financial analysis and improving the quality of suspicious
transaction reports, and continuing the effective implementation of the United Nations Security
Council Resolution 1373 against terrorism financing.

C. Labor Market Reform and Diversification
27.
Staff emphasized the need for creating the right incentives for nationals to take up
jobs in the private sector. Staff projections indicate that growth in the number of new labor market
entrants rises every year given the demographic profile and rising participation rates. With less than
a quarter of the new entrants expected to find jobs in the private sector, the government will face a
trade-off between continuing to absorb the remaining entrants and therefore allow the wage bill to
rise further, or seeing unemployment among nationals rise. To address this challenge, current labor
market structures need to have the right incentive framework to create a skilled domestic workforce
and lead to a self-sustained expansion in employment of nationals in the private sector. They need
to be underpinned by educational and training reforms and active labor policies to improve skills,
pay and productivity in the private sector.

procedures for investors. The establishment of Kuwait Direct Investment Promotion Authority has
resulted in additional foreign direct investment into Kuwait. International experience suggests that,
in addition to creating an economic environment favorable for doing business, Kuwait needs to
implement policies to encourage firms to expand domestic operations and develop export markets,
enhance infrastructure, and support workers in acquiring the necessary skills and education.
30.
A more robust nonfinancial corporate sector would help the diversification process. Expost profitability (return on assets) has remained stable but at low levels, particularly when
compared with other countries, including GCC peers. Companies appear undervalued; lower price to
earnings ratios than in peer countries may point to weaker confidence in Kuwait’s business
environment that the authorities are seeking to improve. Further deepening of asset markets to
provide companies alternative means of financing and investment, improving the investment climate
in the economy, including by reducing costs of doing business in Kuwait, increasing privatization
efforts, strengthening corporate governance and anti-corruption efforts, establishing bankruptcy
procedures, and better data availability to investors, would contribute to better performance of the
corporate sector.
Other issues
31.
There has been significant progress in improving Kuwait’s statistical system, and staff
encouraged the authorities to further their efforts in all areas of economic data. Priority areas
include improving national accounts and compiling quarterly estimates of GDP, compiling real estate
indicators and conducting annual labor market surveys.

STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
High financial buffers provide cushion to continue to support growth in the medium
term through public investment. The decline in oil prices has adversely affected Kuwait’s fiscal and
current account balances and slowed growth in 2014–15. Overall GDP growth will recover from
0.3 percent in 2015 to about 2.8 percent over the medium term as oil production is projected to
increase by 2 percent a year on account of planned investment to increase crude capacity. Non-oil
sector growth is projected to increase to 4 percent over the medium term as the impact of large
investments in 2015 takes effect. Risks to the growth outlook stem mainly from uncertainty about
the future oil market outlook, slow execution of the DP, and an escalation of regional tensions that
could undermine confidence.
33.
Gradual fiscal consolidation in the medium term would reduce vulnerabilities and
bring the fiscal stance closer to benchmark levels indicated by intergenerational equity
considerations, while preserving growth. Delays would result in a worsening fiscal position that
would require a larger adjustment in the future, especially if oil prices fall further. In the meantime,
the choice of how to finance the fiscal deficit should carefully weigh the pros and cons of various
options, including drawing down buffers, and raising domestic and external debt.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

KUWAIT

34.
Achieving the desirable fiscal position will require measures to contain expenditure
growth and increase non-oil revenues. Adjustment of current spending by implementing wage
reform and continuing with subsidy reform, prioritizing and improving the efficiency of capital
expenditure, and expanding non-oil revenues by implementing business profits tax and value added
tax, should form central elements of the fiscal consolidation strategy. Successful formulation and
implementation of medium-term fiscal policy require establishing a medium-term budget
framework that is integrated with the macroeconomic framework, and improving the public financial
management system.
35.
The banking system has shown resilience to oil price shocks. The CBK has continued to
strengthen regulation and supervision of the banking system to safeguard financial stability, and
banks are in a strong position to weather the challenges of lower oil prices. Banks capital adequacy
ratios are high, profitability and provisioning have increased, and asset quality has improved.
Strengthening the macroprudential policy framework, and refining the early warning system and
toolkit, would enable a more systematic assessment and prevention of systemic risk. Focused
attention on collation of real estate indicators is warranted to monitor property market risks.
36.
The peg to a basket remains appropriate for the Kuwaiti economy, as it continues to
provide a nominal anchor. Nevertheless, fiscal consolidation will be needed to bring the exernal
balance to a level consistent with fundamentals and support the peg over the long-term. In the
future, as the economy diversifies, more flexibility in the exchange rate might become appropriate.
37.
Creating the right incentives for nationals to take up jobs in the private sector is
crucial. Implementing labor market policies and structural measures to increase incentives for
private sector-based employment for nationals that reduces the fiscal burden, establishes a flexible,
skilled national workforce, and supports diversification would form part of this strategy. Efforts need
to be underpinned by educational and training reforms and labor policies to improve skills, pay and
productivity in the private sector.
38.
Further structural reforms will help diversification efforts. In addition to creating an
economic environment favorable for doing business, Kuwait needs to implement policies to
encourage firms to expand domestic operations and develop export markets, enhance infrastructure,
and support workers in acquiring the necessary skills and education. Further deepening of asset
markets to provide companies alternative means of financing and investment, improving the
investment climate in the economy, including by reducing costs of doing business in Kuwait,
increasing privatization efforts, strengthening corporate governance and anti-corruption efforts,
establishing bankruptcy procedures, and better data availability to investors, would contribute to
better performance of the corporate sector and help diversification efforts.

Appendix II. External Sector Assessment
Kuwait’s external position is consistent with medium-term fundamentals under appropriate policies.
Estimates from the external sustainability approach suggest that the current account balance in
2015 and the medium term are lower than levels consistent with fundamentals, largely reflecting
lower than optimal savings of exhaustible hydrocarbon revenues for future generations. Under
appropriate fiscal policies, i.e. higher fiscal surpluses, the current account balance would be in line
with fundamentals. The peg to an undisclosed currency basket remains appropriate for Kuwait as it
continues to provide a credible nominal anchor.1
The external position remained strong and the exchange rate appreciated in 2014. The
current account surplus ended at 31 percent of GDP in 2014, about 10 percentage points less than
in 2013—mainly due to lower oil prices. Central bank reserves have remained stable between
6 and 7.5 months of imports over the past few years (7 months of imports in 2014). Total external
debt stood at 23percent of GDP at end-2014. Assets in the sovereign wealth fund are estimated
by staff at 320 percent of GDP, and the non-government net international investment position
was US$122 billion (62 percent of GDP) at end 2014. The nominal effective exchange rate for
Kuwait appreciated 2.3 percent during 2014; it depreciated 3.3 percent against the US dollar, but
appreciated 2.1 percent against the SDR. As of May 2015, Kuwait’s nominal effective exchange
rate appreciated 2.2 percent (y/y); it depreciated against the US dollar about 6.8 percent (y/y), but
appreciated against the SDR 2.6 percent.

The external sustainability approach, based on the permanent income model (PIH),
suggests that the current account surpluses are too low to equitably support the
consumption of future generations.3 The PIH approach is the preferred method for Kuwait
because, rather than reflecting traditional competitiveness issues, a current account gap reflects
suboptimal saving of hydrocarbon revenues. The implied current account norm estimated by this
method (based on a constant real per-capita annuity), is 21 percent of GDP in 2015 which
compares with a current account surplus under the baseline estimated at 10.2 percent of GDP, i.e.
the estimated current account gap is 10.8 percent of GDP. The gap remains broadly unchanged
during the projection period (11.1 percent of GDP in 2020). Since external imbalances in Kuwait
stem largely from the government sector, higher savings should occur through fiscal
consolidation rather than exchange rate adjustments.

KUWAIT

The macro-balance approach based on the External Balance Assessment – Lite (EBA-Lite) indicates
that the current account balance is consistent with fundamentals. This approach uses regression
analysis for a large cross-section of countries to predict the current account consistent with a
range of structural and policy factors, and estimates the impact of changes in these factors on the
norm. Imposing a fiscal policy consistent with intergenerational equity —which implies a fiscal
balance that is 4 percent of GDP stronger than the baseline in 2015— brings the current account
norm to 11 percent of GDP, which basically eliminates the current account gap –the estimated
gap is -0.7 percent of GDP in 2015. A general caveat: while this model has the advantage of
multilateral consistency, it is estimated on a wide group of countries and may not fully capture all
features of undiversified commodity exporters such as Kuwait.4

________________________
1/ The decision to peg the Kuwaiti dinar to an undisclosed currency basket in May 2007 was motivated by the depreciation of
the US dollar against other major currencies and the potential impact of increasing inflationary pressures from imported goods.
See Box 3 in The GCC Monetary Union –Choice of Exchange Rate Regime, IMF (2008).
3/ The approach calculates the current account required for the net present value (NPV) of hydrocarbon and investment income
to equal the NPV of imports net of non-hydrocarbon exports. To support intergenerational equity the economy would need to
choose a path for imports —and hence a current account norm—by accumulating net foreign assets at an appropriate pace. As
with any analytical tool, results are sensitive to the choice of assumptions made (for instance, oil prices, return of assets, and
population growth) as well as the targeted transfer to future generation (annuity).
4/ Reported Coefficient of Determination (R-Squared) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are 0.40 and 0.07, respectively. In
particular, the estimated coefficient that captures the impact of the fiscal balance on the current account is 0.479, which appears
low for an economy like Kuwait. See presentation EBA-Lite in External Sector Assessment, November 2014 by R. Chen.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of August 19, 2015)
The World Bank and the Government of Kuwait developed a rolling four-year Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS), which leverages the setup of a World Bank Country Office in Kuwait (inaugurated in
January 2009). The Kuwait program emphasizes implementation of reforms. Hence all activities are
grounded in the Government five-year plan, and are developed closely with the line ministry/agency
as well as with the Ministry of Finance, which plays the coordinator role and the Bank’s central
counterpart. The current Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS) program is structured around the
following three strategic themes:
(i)
Improving public sector performance – so that public services are delivered transparently,
efficiently and effectively. Key activities under this pillar include Bank support in the areas of
reforming public finance and governance including; tax administration modernization, strengthening
state property institutions and management, streamlining outdated procurement and project cycle
regulations and practices, and capacity building efforts in the area of public finance management
and financial accountability.
(ii)
Economic diversification - Aiming to support reform efforts geared towards transforming
Kuwait into a commercial and financial hub with diversified economic activities and the creation of a
more conducive business environment for private sector development and foreign direct
investment. Bank activities under this theme include: supporting the design and implementation of
an insolvency and creditors rights framework, support in establishing the new Competition
Protection Authority and the National Fund for SME Development.
(iii)
Human development, with a major program to support the quality of education. Bank
support in this area also includes social protection, labor and potentially health policy reforms.

The World Bank is supporting efforts by the Kuwaiti Government to
modernize tax administration. This activity aims to continue capacity
building support started during the first phase through intensive training in
tax operations and modern techniques of tax administration, as well as
through on-the-job training by experts.
The Bank’s current engagement assists with implementation of the
recommendations of the previous phase, which helped improve authorities’
understanding of the current challenges in the solid waste sector: (i)
preparation & implementation of a national priority (BOT) project for the
closure and rehabilitation of existing dumpsites, (ii) elaboration and
adoption of a solid waste master plan consistent with the Kuwait Land-Use
Master plan, (iii) completion & harmonization of existing legal instruments,
starting with a Solid Waste Law, and (iv) establishment of a municipal solid
waste agency.
Building on diagnostic work requested by MoF and presented to the Kuwait
General Administration of Customs (GAC) and MoF, the Bank has been
asked to proceed with finalizing a RAS agreement. The proposed RAS aims
at supporting GAC with reform and modernization programs, based on best
practice, and geared towards improving logistics and border management
performance to further facilitate trade while still ensuring regulatory
compliance, border security and revenue.

ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION

Ministry of Finance
Insolvency and Creditors
Rights – Phase II (P144858)

The Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MoCI) requested support to reform
Kuwait’s investment climate. Following a review of Insolvency and Creditors
Rights (ICR), the Bank recommended developing new laws to regulate
Enterprise Rehabilitation and Liquidation in Kuwait. The Bank is now
supporting: (i) the development of a functional workout framework to help
recovery of Investment Companies and the enterprise sector; (ii) reforms to
improve liquidation and rehabilitation procedures; and (iii) improvements to
professional development in commercial judicial specialization. An official
delegation of the Ministry of Finance as the main counterpart took place in
June 2015. H.E. the Minister of Finance requested to have the program
transferred to the Ministry for it to be under his direct leadership and

The World Bank is providing a comprehensive technical assistance program
to support the establishment of a Competition Protection Authority in
Kuwait and to tackle key challenges at the beginning of CPA’s operation.
The components of the World Bank technical assistance are: 1) Legal review
and amendments of the Competition Law 2) Institutional Set-up 3) ICT
environment and Business Architecture 4) Regulatory and procedural
framework for Mergers, Authorizations/Cartel Exemptions, Market
Definition 5) Competition Advocacy and Sector-specific competition policy
assessments 5) Cooperation with sector regulators and other public
institutions.
Building on the previous Bank engagements with Kuwait SME Fund - Phase
I and Phase II - the Bank is exploring ways to support the Fund with
organizational set-up and implementation (Phase III). To this effect, the
World Bank is proposing a two-year programmatic-approach project,
focusing on: (i) organizational set-up and IT architecture, (ii) SME business
environment, (iii) SME business development, (iv) entrepreneurship culture
development, and (v) data collection, and monitoring and evaluation. The
Bank proposes to conduct annual reviews assessing progress, and
confirming with the client following year approach and activities.
In response to the continued slide in ranking in the Doing Business Report,
KDIPA requested the Bank to organize a workshop to provide members of
the recently formed Doing Business committee the opportunity to better
understand the components of the Doing Business Report and how best to
tackle reforms aiming at improving Kuwait’s business environment. The visit
will also help the Bank team scope a potential RAS engagement to support
KDIPA’s reform effort.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of October 14, 2015)
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Despite further
improvements in the current year, there is scope for improved compilation of the national accounts and
balance of payments statistics through better coordination among statistical agencies. Timeliness,
particularly for the national and fiscal accounts, is an area of concern.
National Accounts and Production: Past improvements of national accounts include: change of the base
year for the constant price data to 2010 and the estimates of value added for subsidized goods and
services of the public utilities sector through the use of input costs (the household expenditure survey was
used previously). Continued progress, especially in the estimation of value added for the oil sector,
requires the dedication of adequate resources and improved coordination between the Ministries of
Planning, Oil, and Finance. The IMF’s statistics department (STA) has provided technical assistance to the
Ministry of Planning to improve national accounts and price data. The main priority is to produce quarterly
national accounts. It would be useful if the Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK) would publish oil sector
information in the Quarterly Statistical Bulletin pertaining to output, refining, domestic consumption,
export price for crude and refined products and the domestic price of petroleum products. These data are
available from the Ministry of Oil. Timeliness of the data needs to be improved. In the last few years, delays
in the production of price indexes caused long lags in the production of real GDP data. Recent
improvements in the compilation of statistics are expected to reduce publication lags and produce
quarterly data.
Price statistics
CPI weights are based on the 2007 household expenditure survey and were introduced into the index for a
reference year of 2007. An improved monthly CPI based on a revised basket has been published in
monthly CPI bulletins with about a one-month lag. The wholesale price index (WPI) needs to be developed
into a producer price index (PPI) which is consistent with the national accounts and includes all
domestically produced goods, ex-factory, for the export and the domestic market. The PPI development
has been ongoing, and the PPI is expected to be published by end-2014.
Government finance statistics: Annual GFS data are reported for publication in the Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook (GFSY). The major components of extrabudgetary revenues (investment income and
transfers of profits of public institutions), extrabudgetary expenditures (interest on foreign debt and
treasury paper), and financing operations conducted by two reserve funds are not reported. Data on
interest on foreign debt and treasury paper are usually provided to Article IV consultation missions, but the
regular provision of data on investment income is lacking.
The authorities have made some progress in fiscal data presentation, but the lack of a suitable
classification of data on the execution of the budget remains a constraint on monitoring effectively fiscal
developments during the year. The authorities’ presentation is not yet fully compliant with the GFSM 2001
guidance, but progress is being made in terms of creating a new chart of accounts and moving reporting
to an accrual basis.

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KUWAIT

Data on the operations of the Public Institute for Social Security are not made available. Sharing of
information between various government agencies could be improved. STA has indicated to the authorities
that operations of the two reserve funds should be classified as part of government, as they perform
activities for public policy purposes (management of debt and assets, and financing of the budget). An
additional extension of coverage would be to report GFS in the form of the Statement of Sources and Uses
of Cash for the consolidated central government. The authorities have also been briefed on the IMF’s
ongoing work to enhance the transparency of fiscal accounts and presentations detailed in the “Code of
Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency” and were encouraged to adopt some of the practices
recommended in the Code.
Monetary and financial statistics
The CBK reports monetary data to STA on a regular and timely basis based on the Standardized Report
Forms (SRFs). CBK needs to work further to distinguish a number of investment companies that accept
deposits from other investment companies that do not accept deposits. Investment companies that accept
deposits should appropriately be classified as part of the depository corporations sector. In the current
SRFs, all investment companies (including those that accept deposits) are classified as other financial
corporations. However, the amount of deposits accepted by investment companies is considered as not
significant. The Capital Markets Authority needs to collate and disseminate information related to
investment companies.
Balance of Payments Statistics: The CBK compiles and disseminates detailed annual data in accordance
with the methodology of the BPM6, while trade data estimates are disseminated monthly. However, data
on capital flows of the nonfinancial private sector are limited. To improve coverage for inward foreign
direct investment, the CBK is making efforts to obtain more data by surveying direct investment
enterprises. The Central Statistical Office (CSO), working with the CBK, implemented the IMF’s Coordinated
Direct Investment Survey in 2010-12. This initiative should improve foreign direct investment statistics.
Enhancements have been made in the estimation of travel services and communication services, but
further improvements are needed in compilation practices and in the estimation of data on several service
items and private transfers.
A major step forward in 2007 was the dissemination of IIP data for 2001 onwards in STA publications.
However, the information on IIP data made available to staff is incomplete as it excludes the external
assets held by the general government (with the exception of loans granted by the Kuwaiti Fund for Arab
Economic Development and general government trade credits). This data is expected to be reported to
the Fund by the Executive Director for Kuwait at the time of the upcoming Article IV board meeting.
The CBK also participates in the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) with data reported for
2003 onwards, and in the recently introduced Coordinated Direct Investment Survey. These data are for the
financial sector acting as end-investors’ or as intermediaries on behalf of residents and do not include
holdings of foreign securities held by government agencies, which comprise the bulk of Kuwait’s
cross-border holdings.
In 2009, STA provided TA on improving external accounts data. The CBK has made good progress since
then, particularly in the substantial revisions to report forms, including the separate reporting of financial
transactions in the BOP and other changes in volume in the international investment position. It has also
made progress in the estimation of remittances data. Yet, delays and data gaps remain. In particular,

coordination among major government entities is needed to provide quarterly data to the CBK in time to
compile timely quarterly statistics. Trade data are compiled by the CSO annually and from 2013, on a
quarterly basis. Furthermore, the response rate for the private nonfinancial sector is low.

Data Standards and Quality

Kuwait is one of the first GDDS participants.
However, most of its metadata, with the exception
of the real sector and socio-demographic
metadata, have not been updated since
October 2002. The CBK maintains its own webpage
where it provides the following data to the public:
money and banking statistics; balance of payments
statistics; trade balance statistics; exchange rate;
GDP by sector and expenditure at current and
constant prices; public finance statistics; CPI and
WPI; and security market indicators. Similarly, the
Ministry of Planning has a webpage where the CSO
publishes data on national accounts, prices, and
other related statistics. The Ministry of Finance
webpage includes detailed data for actual and
estimated budget operations. In addition, the
Kuwait Stock Exchange webpage provides data on
stock market indices, volume and value of
securities traded, as well as privatization schedules
and other related information.

Statement by Mr. Beblawi, Executive Director for Kuwait,
and Mr. Faras, Advisor to Executive Director
November 25, 2015
On behalf of the Kuwaiti authorities, we thank staff for the constructive discussions during
the Article IV mission and the high quality reports. We also appreciate the focus of the
consultation on assessing potential macro-financial risks from low oil prices, as well as fiscal
and financial developments, and proposing adequate policy recommendations. The
authorities were in general agreement with staff’s conclusions and recommendations,
particularly with regard to achieving a gradual but sustained fiscal consolidation, maintaining
financial stability, and supporting long-term growth through economic diversification and job
creation for nationals.
Overview
As an important oil producer, Kuwait has been negatively impacted by the sharp decline in
oil prices during the second half of 2014, which led to a deterioration in the fiscal and current
account balances and a decline in growth. The Kuwaiti authorities acknowledge that low oil
prices may persist over the medium term. They have launched immediate reforms aimed at
ensuring fiscal sustainability and intergenerational equity, while supporting economic growth
and sustaining the welfare of citizens. Moreover, prudent policies over the past years and the
accumulation of high financial buffers in two sovereign wealth funds enable Kuwait to
continue to support growth in the medium term through public investment. The new 2015–19
Development Plan entails investments of around KD 34 billion and wide-ranging structural
reforms in the economy. It aims at providing direction for prioritizing capital expenditure,
encouraging private investment and creating jobs for nationals in the private sector.
Recent Economic and Financial Developments
Although growth was muted in 2014, due to the decline in oil sector activity, non-oil GDP
grew at a healthy rate of about 3 percent. This trend is expected to continue in 2015. Inflation
remained moderate.
Financial market conditions were subdued. Although the stock market index declined by
about 24 percent y-o-y at end-September 2015, affected by volatility in global financial
markets and regional geopolitical instability, corporate sector profitability remained stable.
As expected, the fiscal and external balances have deteriorated after the collapse in oil prices.
The 2014/15 fiscal balance turned into a deficit for the first time following fifteen
consecutive years of surpluses.

2
Fiscal Policies
The fiscal balance has turned into a deficit of 4.4 percent of GDP in 2014/15 from a surplus
of 11.7 percent in the previous year. The authorities acknowledge the need for a structural
fiscal adjustment to reverse spending and revenue trends. They also consider that the ample
financial buffers and borrowing space should be used to implement gradual and sustained
fiscal adjustments, while mitigating any negative impact on growth.
To ensure fiscal sustainability, the authorities intend to undertake measures to contain growth
in spending and increase non-oil revenues. The measures under consideration include subsidy
and wage reforms and introducing VAT and a business profits tax, with associated savings
estimated by staff to amount to 1 percent of GDP in 2016 and increase to 7 percent in 2020.
The Government has already started implementing these measures by lifting subsidies on
diesel and kerosene and raising jet fuel price. It also presented to Parliament a plan on public
wage reform, prepared a draft law for business profit tax, and recently set a VAT framework
along with other GCC countries. Implementation of the planned measures is expected to
result in a considerable improvement in the fiscal stance, measured by the non-oil primary
balance as a share of non-oil GDP, by about 20 percentage points over the medium term.
Moreover, important further progress was achieved in the budgeting process as the
government has decided to move to top-down budgeting in FY 2016/17 and to a mediumterm budgeting in FY 2017/18, both of which will help in improving budget planning and
execution processes. In addition, the budgeting process will be further strengthened by the
planned establishment of an overall Public Financial Management Committee and the
implementation of the Government Financial Management Information System.
Financial Sector Policies
The banking sector is well-capitalized, well-regulated and enjoys high provisioning buffers.
This renders the sector resilient to shocks from the real estate and equity markets and a
further decline in oil prices, as confirmed by the results of the stress tests conducted by staff.
The Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK) is closely monitoring potential risks and stands ready to
address them using macroprudential tools. The CBK is continuously strengthening its
regulations and macroprudential tools to preserve financial stability and mitigate potential
risks from real estate and equity markets. Banks are under Basel III regulations for capital,
including a framework for domestic systemically important banks, liquidity, and leverage,
and they are subject to loan-to-value and debt-service-to-income ratios in the real estate
sector. Investment companies, which have been through difficulties since the financial crisis,
are now closely monitored by the CBK and the Capital Market Authority. The authorities
agree with staff recommendations to implement a formal macroprudential coordination
mechanism to identify potential systemic risks arising from nonbank financial institutions.

3
Continued progress was made in strengthening the AML/CFT framework, based on which
the Financial Action Task Force (FAFT) has removed Kuwait from the list of countries
subject to its monitoring process. At the same time, the authorities strengthened the
anticorruption framework by issuing the bylaws and recently making the Anti Corruption
Authority operational.
Labor Market Reform and Diversification
As is the case in other oil-producing countries, the public sector has become the main
employer of nationals in Kuwait with higher wages than the private sector. This phenomenon
created a dual labor market and a challenge for the government to encourage nationals to
work for the private sector.
The authorities concur with staff that creating the right incentives for nationals is crucial to
raise their employment in the private sector. Accordingly, the 2015–19 Development Plan
establishes a number of mechanisms to create more job opportunities for nationals in the
private sector including through: supporting private investment to boost the share of the
private sector in economic activity; establishing the National Fund for SMEs Development;
raising mandatory national labor ratios, and moving forward with a comprehensive
privatization program. At the same time, the Development Plan encourages the private sector
to invest more in high-tech and capital intensive industries to match the qualifications of the
highly educated national labor force and lowers reliance on low-skilled expatriates. With
technical assistance from the World Bank, the authorities have set up a new Labor Market
Information System to provide more accurate, detailed and up-to-date information to better
match supply and demand in the labor market.
To further advance diversification, the authorities are focused on structural reforms to
improve the business environment and create more business opportunities to stimulate
domestic investors and attract foreign ones. A number of developments have been
accomplished in the last two years in this regard including: the recent establishment of the
National Fund for SMEs Development; the creation of the Direct Investment Promotion
Authority; issuance the Privatization bylaws; and establishment of the ICT Authority and the
Transportation Authority. The authorities strive for a more robust and dynamic corporate
sector that is essential for the diversification process. Issuing the new corporate law was a
step in this direction.
As recognized by staff, the Central Statistical Bureau has witnessed significant improvements
in recent years to enhance the quality and frequency of data through the application of
international standards and conducting new surveys that provide better insight in a number of
sectors.

4
Concluding Remarks
The authorities place a high priority on ensuring fiscal sustainability and intergenerational
equity and successfully diversifying the economy through well-designed, gradual, and
sustained reforms. The authorities recognize that the recent sharp decline in oil prices
provides them with an opportunity to implement reforms without delay. They are keenly
aware of the difficulty related to implementing these reforms, given potential political and
social resistance. They are exerting a great effort to better communicate the objectives of the
reform plans with the public and Parliament, knowing that with oil prices expected to remain
low in the medium term, any delay in reform will be at a higher cost in the future.
