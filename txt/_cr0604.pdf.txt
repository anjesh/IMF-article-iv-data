EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
•

Economic growth, which has been strong for several years, has fallen to an estimated
3½ percent of GDP this year. The fiscal deficit has deteriorated sharply, though it will
fall significantly this year and next, in part by resorting to temporary measures.
Competitiveness, however, continues to erode.

•

The authorities introduced a spate of structural reforms this year, including corporate
tax cuts, extended shopping hours, more flexible overtime arrangements, a new
competition law, elimination of job tenure at the telecoms firm, simplification of
business licensing, and better economic integration of immigrants.

Policy discussions and assessment
•

Fiscal consolidation is the top priority. The authorities intend to bring the deficit
below 3 percent in 2006. Staff supports this, but argues for a multi-year program of
durable spending measures to achieve structural budget balance by 2010, after which
aging costs begin to rise. Sustained current primary spending restraint would be
bolstered by deep reforms to expenditure management and tax administration, as
recommended by this year’s fiscal ROSC and Fund TA reports.

•

Pension reform will be needed to avoid explosive public debt. The authorities stand
by an election promise not to introduce measures in this term of office; staff argues
for a more vigorous public debate to pave the way for eventual reform.

•

The FSAP judged the banking sector to be generally in good health, although credit
growth raised concerns about credit quality, and made a number of recommendations
to strengthen supervision and risk management further.

•

Structural reforms need to be extended to improve productivity and
competitiveness. On product markets, the unfinished agenda includes improved tax
administration, tax simplification, reduced red tape, modernization of bankruptcy law,
liberalization of gas and electricity markets, and privatization. On labor markets,
employment protection measures need to be relaxed, and minimum wages should be
reduced (implying a change in central bargaining arrangements), at least for sectors
under economic stress. The authorities are enthusiastic about product market reform,
but are not sanguine about prospects for labor market reform.

•

Data are adequate for surveillance, but should be strengthened. Fiscal data are still in
flux, fiscal financing data should be published, the quarterly national accounts are
poor (a new series is to be published next year), banking system data should be more
timely, and the statistical office should be given formal independence.

-4-

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Real GDP growth has been very strong for several years, but economic
imbalances have also developed, notably a sharply deteriorating fiscal position
(Figure 1, Table 1). Growth has been underpinned by a sharp fall in interest rates due to
adoption of the euro and subsequent ECB easing, rapid increases in private-sector credit
following financial sector liberalization, procyclical fiscal policy, and, most recently,
spending on the Olympics games. In addition, strong capital formation, high labor
productivity growth, and significant immigration have all contributed to an expansion of
aggregate supply. Despite this favorable economic backdrop, the fiscal deficit has widened,
reaching 6.6 percent of GDP in 2004, the primary surplus turned into a deficit, and public
debt stood at 111 percent of GDP (Table 2).1 The key reason for the fiscal deterioration was
spending: in 2000−04, real primary expenditure grew by 5.9 percent a year on average
(5.1 percent excluding the Olympics) in 2000−04.
2.
In 2005, growth is expected to slow to 3½ percent, still well above most other
euro-area countries. The end of Olympic spending and, to a lesser extent, rising oil prices
moderated domestic demand, although private consumption remained robust. Export growth
fell somewhat, notwithstanding strength in the key shipping and tourism sectors, but import
growth also fell after the Olympics-related surge in 2004, leaving, unusually, a very slight
positive foreign balance contribution.
3.
The government, in its first budget, implemented substantial consolidation. This
year, staff estimates the deficit will fall to 4.6 percent of GDP, a reduction of 2 percentage
points, associated primarily with the end of Olympics spending (accounting for 1¼ percent of
GDP, including a sharp fall in public-sector investment), lower interest costs (½ percent of
GDP), and lower growth of public sector wage costs and pensions. 2

1

Fiscal data for 1997−2004 were revised up substantially after the “fiscal audit” by the authorities
and Eurostat, as described in Box 2 of the 2004 Greece Article IV staff report (Country Report
05/43). As a result, two rating agencies downgraded Greece. Interest rate spreads were little affected,
though they have widened slightly in the past year. The figures were revised up again this September,
and are still not definitive.
2

At the time of the mission, the authorities planned to securitize tax arrears to raise revenue of
1 percent of GDP in 2005 and another 1 percent in 2006. However, they subsequently decided not to
include the 2005 exercise in the 2006 budget document pending resolution of technical issues with
Eurostat, although some securitization may still take place. A decision on a securitization for 2006
will be made by year-end. This operation involves a special purpose corporation, which receives the
proceeds from the state’s collection of back taxes and which bears all the risk in the event of a
shortfall.

4.
Inflationary pressures persist and
competitiveness continues to erode. A persistent
inflation differential vis-à-vis the euro area and
high unit labor cost increases, due to a positive
output gap and a tightening labor market, have
resulted in a steady appreciation of the real
exchange rate, more than reversing an
improvement in the run-up to joining the euro. As
a result, export growth has been weak and export
market shares have fallen by some 17 percent
since 2000. Inward FDI has been chronically
weak, suggesting a reticence to invest in Greece.
5.
The Greek banking system has been
transformed in the past decade, as privatesector intermediation has displaced holdings
of public debt. Commercial banks have
benefited from liberalization, privatization, and
buoyant economic growth to extend credit
aggressively to new clients—particularly
households and SMEs (Figure 2). They have also
moved into southeast Europe, hitherto relatively
underbanked. Rapid credit expansion has raised
concerns, however, since the resilience of the
system has not been tested by a sharp economic
slowdown in growth or higher interest rates. The
nonbank financial sector is small and plays only
a limited role in financial intermediation.

Box 1. Greece: Policy Recommendations and Implementation
Fiscal policy. The Fund has called for significant consolidation, and the deficit is being
reduced significantly this year and next. A comprehensive fiscal ROSC was done earlier this
year. To strengthen fiscal management, the authorities have established task forces to examine
the recommendations of FAD technical assistance missions on expenditure management and
tax administration.
Pension and health care reform. The Fund urged public dialog to lay the groundwork for
early action to deal with the fiscal costs of aging. The government has raised the public profile
of this issue, but will not implement reforms in this term of office. Steps have been taken to
control hospital spending.
Data. The Fund has for some time called for improvements in data quality, and efforts in this
area continue. Nevertheless, historical budget estimates are still under discussion with
Eurostat, data for the financing side of the budget are not yet available, and the quarterly
national accounts data are of poor quality.
Financial sector. Both banks and the supervisor have strengthened risk management, in line
with longstanding Fund recommendations. However, the new insurance supervisor is still not
operational. In line with Fund advice, the authorities undertook an FSAP in 2005.
Structural policy. The Fund has urged greater flexibility to improve competitiveness, and
significant steps were taken this year in both product and labor markets. The authorities plan
further measures in the years ahead.

6.
Structural reform, after languishing for some time, is now underway, and
political support for reform appears to be strengthening. In recent months the
government has introduced a number of important measures, including reductions in the
corporate tax rate; unified and extended shopping hours; more flexible overtime
arrangements; a new law to better integrate immigrants; a new competition law that brings
Greece into line with EU standards; a stronger competition authority; further gas and
electricity liberalization; and simplification of business licensing procedures, first for
industrial companies and subsequently for the commercial sector. While opposition to
specific measures remains, the successful implementation of these initiatives suggests
increasing public acceptance of the need for reform. Reflecting this mood, the Prime
Minister’s annual policy address in September and the National Reform Program both
emphasized the need to further improve productivity and competitiveness if Greece is to
achieve the Lisbon objectives and close the income gap with western Europe.
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
7.
Policy discussions focused on three areas: fiscal consolidation to ensure
sustainability, the financial sector, and competitiveness and medium-term growth.

-7-

A. Economic Outlook
8.
There was broad agreement on estimated growth in 2005, but the mission was
somewhat less optimistic than the authorities for 2006 and beyond. For 2005, the
authorities emphasized that the Greek economy had continued to outperform the euro-area by
a significant margin, despite fiscal consolidation. For 2006, the authorities project a small
increase in real GDP growth to 3¾ percent, while the staff projects a mild slowdown to
3¼ percent. Both the authorities and staff expect private consumption to remain strong and
investment to rebound from its post-Olympic slump. However, the staff was more cautious
regarding the contribution of the external sector, where lost competitiveness could take a toll,
and the strength of domestic demand, which could be weakened by faltering confidence
(Figure 3) and the full-year effect of high oil prices. Beyond 2006, the authorities were
optimistic about medium-term growth, pointing to implemented and planned structural
reforms and infrastructure improvements. Staff projects a gradual decline in growth to its
potential rate of 3 percent 3—which is still high by comparison with most European
countries—as the effects of euro entry and financial liberalization wear off and
competitiveness erodes further.4
9.
It was recognized that there are significant risks on both sides of these
projections. Investment could rebound more strongly than expected from its Olympicsinduced ripple, although higher interest rates

could dampen activity. Growth would also be

Staff has revised up its estimate of potential growth in light of the continued strength of real GDP,

Owing to competitive losses staff projects weak export growth and, despite slower growth, a

agenda as addressing the key issue of competitiveness. Regarding the Portuguese experience,
the authorities conceded resemblances, notably very high credit growth and procyclical fiscal
policy during the boom, but stressed important differences, including a much lower ratio of
private debt to GDP and the fact that Greece is in a position to benefit from the rapid
economic development of southeast Europe.
B. Fiscal Policy
10.
The authorities have made deficit reduction their top priority. In the context of
the EU excessive deficit procedure (EDP), they are committed to lowering the deficit below
3 percent of GDP in 2006, but were concerned to avoid substantial adverse effects on
economic growth or social cohesion. For 2005, budget implementation has been strong on
the spending side, but revenue collection fell well short of expectations because of a surge in
tax evasion, perhaps associated with reforms to the tax inspectorate, designed to curb
corruption, which included replacing many employees. The authorities reported that they had
begun to take corrective measures, but in the meantime they planned to securitize tax arrears
(but see footnote 2) to ensure adequate progress toward the EDP commitment.
11.
The authorities plan further significant consolidation in 2006, although they are
relying in part on temporary measures and, at the time of writing, policies for a
significant portion of the adjustment were not specified. The authorities target a deficit of
2.6 percent of GDP in 2006, with measures

the revenue assumed by the authorities, staff
projects a deficit of 2.7 percent of GDP.
12.
The mission supported the large fiscal consolidation in 2005−06, but argued
durable measures would be needed. In this context, the mission was critical of
securitization and other temporary measures, which do not improve the underlying budget
position, and of past resort to tax amnesties, which undermine compliance. Net of temporary
measures and adjusted for the cycle, staff projects the deficit would still be about 4¼ percent
of GDP in 2006. In the absence of further measures, the outlook is for little narrowing of the

-9-

deficit in coming years (Table 3). Given very high levels of public debt, such an outcome
would expose the Greek economy to continued risks to debt sustainability in the event of
significant interest rate increases and, especially, should economic growth decline sharply
(Figure 4).
13.
The mission also argued for continued consolidation to achieve structural budget
balance by 2010, since the costs of population aging are projected to begin to rise steeply
shortly after that. This would require structural deficit reductions of about 1 percent of GDP
a year, on average (Table 4). Front-loading of consolidation would be desirable to take full
advantage of currently buoyant economic growth and because the electoral cycle will make
restraint increasingly difficult in 2007−08. Given the authorities’ policy to sustain public
investment and implement tax reform, priorities supported by staff, current primary spending
growth would have to be held to levels well below rates earlier in this decade. Nevertheless,
there would still be room for real primary current spending to rise in real terms if the
economy grows as in the staff projection and revenue collection remain strong.
14.
The authorities agreed that further, durable measures would be needed in 2007
and beyond to ensure strong public finances. They emphasized, however, that
the 2005−06 deficit reduction was very large and that it would take time to develop and
implement more structural measures. Next year, a key focus would be greater control of
state-owned enterprises, with a view to reducing the need for subsidies and loan guarantees
(see Section D, below). In addition, the authorities were reinforcing tax collection through
electronic cross-checking of VAT returns, and planned to step up absorption of EU funds.

15.
The mission also recommended that spending be clearly prioritized, which
would be facilitated by a multi–year adjustment strategy and tax and expenditure
reform. Broad areas of possible saving (some of which are in train) include: continued
restraint of public sector wages, which have

identified weaknesses in the current budget
system—including a focus on spending lines rather than program objectives, ineffective audit
and accounting controls, and lack of transparency—and offered recommendations for
improvement (Box 2). The authorities welcomed these initiatives and have already
established high-level task forces to review the recommendations. In view of the sweeping

- 10 -

nature of the suggested reforms, the mission urged that the task forces be given strong
political backing.
16.
The authorities plan further tax reform, with a view to stimulating economic
activity. The corporate tax rate is to be cut again, to 25 percent, and a real estate tax is under
consideration. Reforms to the personal income tax (PIT), to be implemented in 2007−10, are
being formulated which provisionally involve reducing the number of brackets, lowering the
top rate, and raising the basic exemption. The mission supported such reforms, provided
deficit reduction objectives were not compromised. Regarding the PIT, it warned against
expecting a very large revenue boost from the elimination of tax brackets, and argued that
major gains would arise instead from the simplification of deductions, which would dovetail
with tax administration reforms. The authorities concurred, noting that they intended to
strictly limit revenue losses from the PIT reform, although the relevant calculations had not
been completed.
Box 2. Greece: Key Recommendations of ROSC on Fiscal Transparency, and Technical
Assistance on Public Expenditure Management and Tax Administration
•

Fully consolidate budget, including the ordinary and investment budgets, and execute through a
more transparent treasury single account.

•

Move to programmatic budgeting and a medium term budget framework, supported by
comprehensive mid-year reviews and fiscal sustainability analyses.

•

Extend management systems to the entire general government, with better defined responsibilities
and more complete reporting at the sub-national level and pension funds.

•

Begin to move to full accrual accounting.

•

Make quasi-fiscal activities more transparent.

•

Streamline expenditure controls with greater emphasis over commitments.

•

Strengthen the internal financial management in budget institutions to promote accountability.

•

Move to ex-post, value-for-money audits, increasing the relevance of the Court of Audit’s annual
reports and the effectiveness of parliamentary oversight.

•

Introduce modern system of self-assessment in tax administration supported by risk-based
enforcement, and reduce degree of discretion.

•

Return to periodic filing of VAT returns.

•

Introduce stronger measures to collect tax arrears.

•

Improve accounting and budget management through more effective information technology.

17.
The authorities and the mission agreed that, in the absence of corrective
measures, pension and health-care costs threaten longer-term fiscal sustainability.
Spending on these items is set to rise by 10½ percent of GDP between 2010 and 2050,
according to 2001 EC estimates (which are in the process of being updated), which would
result in an explosive debt-GDP ratio in the absence of corrective action. The authorities

- 11 -

stand by an election commitment not to act in its current term of office, but have begun to
prepare the ground by referring the issue to the Economic and Social Council for discussion
by social partners. The mission agreed that building political support was a prerequisite to
reform. Staff noted that time was running short, however, especially since pension reforms
often became fully effective only long after implementation, and urged that a more visible
and comprehensive dialog be begun soon. A key part of such a discussion will be updated
estimates of aging costs. The National Actuarial Authority has been charged with this task,
but has fallen far behind schedule, and the mission therefore recommended that additional
resources be provided immediately, including by outsourcing the work. On health care, the
authorities have recently improved financial monitoring and procurement systems, while
recognizing that additional measures will be needed, including better pricing and costing
mechanisms and improved auditing.

The mission also laid out a number of reform options, based on experience in
other countries.6 Such policies include reducing high replacement rates, running budget
surpluses beyond 2010 to reduce public debt more rapidly, raising the effective retirement
age, streamlining the highly fragmented system and further unifying entitlement conditions,
developing a clear vision on an adequate (but affordable) level of minimum protection, and
strengthening sustainability assessments.
C. Financial Sector

The FSAP concluded that the banking system appears profitable and well
capitalized, and offered a number of recommendations (Box 3). Capital positions are

Box 3. Greece: FSAP—Main Recommendations
Stability-related issues
•

Close monitoring of credit risk is critical, particularly regarding lending to new clients and in new regions.

•

Develop a more integrated monitoring and reporting system of banks’ risk management techniques.

•

Bring the Insurance Supervisory Commission (ISC) to operational readiness as soon as possible.

•

Develop a more risk-focused, forward-looking approach to financial supervision, including (i) expanding
on-site inspection; and (ii) developing supervisory capacity to assess risks.

Key structural issues
•

Intensify cooperation with regional supervisors and increase on-site inspections of the Greek banks’
subsidiaries in Southeastern Europe.

•

Address tax and legal restrictions that create competitive disadvantages (e.g., the 60 basis point charge and
labor market rigidities).

•

Streamline the legal process for settling disputes concerning debt recovery, to match EU averages.

•

Develop more detailed internal BoG procedures for crisis resolution.

•

Strengthen the deposit insurance system by (i) establishing funding procedures in case of need; and
(ii) ensuring that adequate information on insured deposits is available.

Strengthening supervisory arrangements
•

Strengthen legal protection for all financial sector supervisors.

•

Develop expertise by supervisory staff in areas where market practices are evolving rapidly (e.g., risk
management techniques, and use of capital market funding instruments).

•

Establish procedures for effective cooperation among the different regulatory bodies.

•

Ensure operational independence of the ISC by isolating staff making decisions that affect the financial
condition of insurance firms from industry or political influence.

•

Strengthen HCMC accountability by reporting on performance to government and parliament,
implementing internal rules on disclosure of conflicts of interest for board members, and establishing a
code of conduct for staff.

•

Ensure wide adoption of, and compliance with, IFRS by all companies listed on the Athens Stock
Exchange.

strong and returns on assets and equity have risen so far this year (Tables 5, 6, and 7).
However, bank credit to the private sector has grown very rapidly for several years, raising
potential challenges in managing associated risks. Nonperforming loans exceed European
averages and are high for the current stage of Greece’s economic cycle. Stress tests revealed
that bank soundness is not threatened by market risk, but also that banks carry significant
unhedged equity and interest rate risks on their banking books. Greek banks have high cost
structures and, since profitability is supported by high spreads for consumer lending,
intensified competition will pose challenges. In addition, as deposit growth falls short of
rapid credit growth, banks are increasingly tapping new, more costly sources of funding.
Larger banks are raising funds in euro-area capital markets, but access is limited for smaller
banks with lower credit ratings. Finally, the introduction of IFRS may result in one-time

- 13 -

capital charges, as the new standards have tighter rules on assessment of impaired assets,
asset valuation and hedging, and recognition of employee benefits (including pension
obligations).
20.
The authorities emphasized that both the BoG and the banks themselves were
responding to these risks and challenges. The BoG has tightened the prudential
framework, strengthened provisioning, and improved on-site and off-site inspection.
Preparations for the move to Basle II are well underway, and the large banks are developing
sophisticated risk management capabilities to manage these new challenges. Preparations in
some of the medium-sized banks are lagging however. Also, these techniques are based on
historical data that do not reflect experience over a full economic cycle, raising the
possibility that credit risk may prove greater than now estimated. Legislation has been put in
place for the transfer of bank pensions to the public sector system, although the process is not
yet complete.
21.
The nonbank financial sector is not systemically important at present, but the
mission argued for strengthened supervision in anticipation of medium-term
challenges. While the capital markets supervisor is gaining credibility and effectiveness, it
will face important regulatory challenges as IFRS and stronger auditing standards are
implemented. The insurance sector is weak and poorly supervised, and the mission urged that
the new supervisory body, which was legislated in February 2004, be made fully operational
as soon as possible, and that its independence from the industry be assured. The mission also
argued for stronger pension supervision, since existing first-pillar schemes have some of the
characteristics of occupational schemes and enjoy explicit or implicit government backing,
and second-pillar schemes are likely to become more common. Finally, the authorities and
the mission agreed on the need for greater cooperation among supervisory agencies, and the
authorities plan to establish a coordinating committee chaired by the BoG.
D. Competitiveness and Medium-Term Growth
22.
The authorities viewed improved competitiveness as key to sustaining mediumterm growth and closing the gap in living standards with western Europe. They
concurred with the mission that a sustained

Similarly, labor market performance is generally

- 14 -

poor by comparison with other EU countries, with high unemployment rates, including high
long-term unemployment, and low participation rates, especially among youth and women
(Figure 5).7
23.
The mission welcomed the spate of reform measures put in place this year, but
argued that more needed to be done to ensure robust medium-term growth. On product
markets, priorities included further efforts to reduce red tape and the petty corruption in
nurtures, rapid adoption of a modernized bankruptcy law (now under study by a high-level
commission), and faster gas and electricity market liberalization. On the labor market side,
the mission called for reform of employment protection and more flexibility regarding the
central bargain struck by labor and business to lower minimum wages, at least in sectors
facing severe economic pressure (currently, minimum wages are agreed at a central level by
the social partners and extended economy-wide by law).8 The authorities indicated that they
intend to press ahead on the product market side; on labor markets they agreed that further
significant measures were desirable, but doubted they would be feasible, at least in the near
term.
24.
A key set of reforms involves an overhaul of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). In
the telecoms company, permanent job tenure and guaranteed pay scales were eliminated for
new employees, although at the cost of an expensive buy-out of many existing workers. The
mission welcomed this measure, and the intention of the government to extend it to other
SOEs. In addition, the authorities are strengthening the governance of SOEs by introducing
IFRS and closer oversight of their business plans, an initiative the mission also supported,
although it saw the main medium-term benefit in terms of preparing SOEs for eventual
privatization. The mission pointed out that privatization, beyond raising money to reduce
public debt, would contribute to improved product market performance if government
control were ended. The authorities largely agreed with this perspective, and reiterated that
they plan to continue the privatization process, although it would probably be done gradually
in most cases.
25.
Regarding investment, the authorities introduced a new framework law for
public-private partnerships (PPPs) and a new investment law. PPPs falling under the new
framework are to be introduced gradually, beginning in 2006, with the expectation that costs
will prove lower than the alternative of public provision. The mission warned against
undertaking PPPs principally to defer the budgetary costs of investments, and argued that
care should be taken in the selection of projects, PPPs should be integrated into the overall
public investment strategy, and the full costs, both current and future, should be made
7

An important reservation is that these product and labor market statistics refer to the formal
economy, and it can be argued that Greece’s large gray economy, although undesirable in many
respects, enhances flexibility.
8

Reducing employment protection and increasing labor bargaining flexibility are also key OECD
recommendations (2005 Economic Survey of Greece, Chapter 4).

- 15 -

transparent in the relevant budget documents. The authorities explained that a high-level
body at the MoEF would be responsible for deciding which investment projects would be
suitable as PPPs, and that the accounting would be fully transparent. The mission, noting that
the law covered only smaller projects (although by unanimous decision the interministerial
committee implementing the law can bring larger projects under its purview), argued that the
same procedures and safeguards should be extended to all projects. The investment law,
which is designed to promote regional development, is meant to involve relatively small
amounts of money, at least for the next two years, but the mission expressed concern that
budgetary costs not get out of hand.
E. Data
26.
Economic data have improved significantly, but further strengthening is
warranted in some areas. The very large revisions to the fiscal numbers for 1997−2004
called into question the reliability of the fiscal data. While the authorities, in collaboration
with Eurostat, made marked improvements last year, another revision this September and the
fact that some issues are still outstanding suggest that problems remain. Also, comprehensive
financing-side data for the general government are still not available, and progress seems
limited. The quarterly national accounts estimates are difficult to interpret, since the raw
numbers are not available and the seasonally adjusted numbers appear to have a pronounced
seasonal pattern. The authorities agreed that their methodology is inadequate and results in
incomplete deseasonalization, but reported that a new estimation procedure has been
developed, and the new data series were to be published in 2006. More timely banking
system data are needed for transparency, a point the authorities agreed with, although they
also noted that the shift to IFRS had delayed data releases so far this year. Regarding general
data integrity issues, the authorities noted that National Statistical Service intends to adopt
the new EU Statistics Code of Practice. The mission argued that credibility would be further
bolstered by granting the Service full independence—it is currently part of the MoEF—but
there are no plans to do so.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
27.
Greece has made important progress this year in addressing pressing
macroeconomic and structural policy challenges, but imbalances remain severe.
Following relentless rises in the fiscal deficit in recent years, despite high growth and low
interest rates, the authorities have been successful in cutting the deficit, largely through
spending restraint, and are committed to bringing it below 3 percent of GDP next year. Also,
to address Greece’s relatively weak productivity and labor market performance, the
authorities have implemented important structural reforms. Much remains to be done on both
fronts, but building on these initiatives will foster sustainable and healthy public finances and
promote the dynamism and competitiveness needed to ensure continued strong economic
growth over the medium term.
28.
Following several years of very strong performance, growth seems set to
moderate, but should nevertheless continue to compare favorably with that in the euro
area. The economic boom has been fueled by low interest rates, reflecting euro adoption and
supportive monetary policy in the euro area, and a procyclical fiscal stance. It has been

- 16 -

financed by rapid private-sector credit growth following financial-sector liberalization. This
year, the end of Olympics spending weakened domestic demand, and real GDP growth is
expected to fall to a still-robust 3½ percent. The real exchange rate has appreciated in recent
years because of a sustained inflation differential, resulting in a worrying loss of
competitiveness, and the situation cannot continue indefinitely. In the years ahead, the
prospect is for a return to trend growth of about 3 percent, as the stimulus from adoption of
the euro fades, and higher oil prices, further erosion of competitiveness, and needed fiscal
consolidation restrain demand.
29.
Fiscal consolidation is the top policy priority and the authorities’ goal to reduce
the deficit below 3 percent of GDP in 2006 is welcome, but more durable measures will
be needed. The consolidation so far in 2005 and planned for 2006 is substantial, and
demonstrates resolve to tackle the dire fiscal situation. The authorities appropriately cut
spending when the Olympics ended, rather than diverting resources to other uses, and have
reduced the growth of the public sector wage bill from very high rates. Current policies also
have weakness, however, especially from a medium-term perspective. Temporary
expedients, such as securitization, do not improve the underlying budgetary position. For
2006, the effort has tilted toward revenue increases and less infrastructure investment rather
than current spending restraint, and additional high-quality measures still need to be
specified to meet the deficit objective. More broadly, consolidation efforts will have to shift
decisively toward control of current spending, which would be fostered by reforms to budget
processes that emphasize strategic planning and program prioritization, and strengthened
expenditure management and tax administration.
30.
Fiscal consolidation will need to continue in 2007 and beyond to foster
sustainable public finances, especially in view of population aging. From this perspective,
a structural budget balance by the end of this decade would be a prudent objective.
Achieving it will require structural deficit reductions of about 1 percent of GDP a year, on
average, although some front-loading would be desirable to make as much progress as
possible while economic growth is still strong. Since further tax cuts and infrastructure
investment are critical to continued growth, adjustment will have to fall on current primary
spending growth, which will have to be held to well below the high rates characteristic of
recent years. While it is possible to identify broad areas of possible savings—restraining
public sector wages, and reducing defense spending, for example—better prioritization of
spending programs will be key.
31.
A multi-year fiscal strategy and reforms to budgeting, expenditure management,
and tax administration would underpin a program of sustained fiscal consolidation. The
early establishment of high level task forces on expenditure management and tax
administration is welcome, and their recommendations will need to receive strong political
backing. Key priorities for expenditure management are to focus the budget process on
programs (including by integrating the ordinary and investment budgets), streamline
spending control, improve auditing, and evaluate program outcomes relative to budgeted
objectives. Reform of tax administration should be centered on developing a modern system
of assessment supported by risk-based enforcement mechanisms, frequent periodic filing of

- 17 -

VAT returns, improved audit procedures, and stronger measures to collect tax arrears. The
tradition of tax amnesties should be abandoned. Progress on both the expenditure and tax
fronts will require improved information management and systems.
32.
The long-term fiscal outlook is dominated by rising pension and health-care
outlays, and reforms need to be implemented as soon as possible. Spending on these
items will soon begin to rise sharply because of adverse demographics and, in the absence of
corrective measures, will eventually result in the explosive growth of the public debt. Public
debate on pension reform has already begun, but a highly visible and comprehensive social
discussion is needed immediately to explore the key issues and possible solutions, with a
view to early implementation of urgently needed reforms. In this regard, the authorities need
to bring the National Actuarial Authority up to full strength so it can quickly update long-run
projections of the fiscal costs of aging. Health-care reform is also required. Initiatives to
improve the procurement process are a welcome step forward, but additional measures will
be needed to control costs while ensuring a high level of service.
33.
Liberalization and privatization have resulted in a welcome transformation and
expansion of the Greek banking system, but have also raised challenges. Commercial
banks are well capitalized, profitable, and liquid, but the sustained period of rapid credit
growth has raised the risk that credit quality may deteriorate rapidly in the event of adverse
economic developments. Banks are also relatively small and have high costs, and may thus
be vulnerable to intensifying competitive pressures in a rapidly integrating market. The
insurance industry is weak and poorly supervised, and the pension sector, while now
dominated by government-guaranteed schemes, is likely to see a rise in second-pillar
schemes, raising questions of the adequacy of supervision.
34.
In these circumstances, the supervisory framework should be strengthened
further. The BoG should continue to monitor closely the rapid expansion of bank assets,
particularly the growth of nonperforming loans, and to improve its capacity to supervise new
lines of bank business. In addition, effort should be made to develop risk management
capacity more uniformly across banks, and to better integrate it with business operations. An
important priority is to make the new insurance supervisor operational, fully resourced, and
independent as quickly as possible. Pension supervision should also be strengthened. Across
sectors, procedures should be established to ensure effective cooperation among supervisory
agencies and to strengthen the legal protection of supervisors.
35.
Improving productivity and competitiveness are vital to raising living standards
to those in western Europe. The priorities of the National Reform Program are appropriate
and would contribute importantly to achieving the Lisbon objectives if associated policies are
implemented effectively. The recent introduction of a number of structural reforms and the
authorities’ determination to continue on that course are commendable. Further measures to
improve the business climate should be pursued vigorously. Simplification of the tax system,
lower tax rates, and an overhauled tax administration will be key in this regard. The reform
of business licensing and the planned modernization of bankruptcy law are all welcome, and
should be pursued vigorously. Gas and electricity markets are also being liberalized, but a
more rapid pace would enhance the economic gains from this process. The strengthened

- 18 -

Competition Authority needs strong political support to implement the new competition law
and to tackle uncompetitive activities more aggressively.
36.
Labor markets are also undergoing important reforms, but the pace should be
accelerated. The easing of overtime restrictions will improve flexibility and promote hiring,
and the new immigration law will bring workers into the formal economy, to everyone’s
benefit. Further reforms are needed, however, to spur hiring and prevent job losses. These
should include the relaxation of strong employment protection legislation, greater
opportunity for opting-out of aspects of the centrally agreed minimum wages, especially in
sectors under stress. Preventing further losses in competitiveness will ultimately require
wage growth of no more than the sum of productivity growth in Greece and inflation in the
euro area.
37.
Plans to reform the SOEs are welcome, and in many cases privatization should
be the eventual goal. Plans to eliminate job tenure and introduce private sector pay scales
for new employees, introduce IFRS, strengthen corporate governance, and ensure thorough
oversight of business plans will, if successful, improve performance. This, in turn, should
reduce the need for subsidies and loan guarantees, thereby promoting fiscal adjustment.
However, care should be taken to limit early retirement packages, in order to avoid both the
drain on public finances and an “early retirement” culture. In a broader perspective, putting
SOEs on a commercial footing should in many cases be considered a first step toward
eventual privatization, in order to reduce the burden on the state and increase economic
efficiency and dynamism.
38.
The new PPP law is welcome but should be used cautiously and the framework
should be extended to large projects. PPPs, if properly implemented, hold the promise of
increasing the efficiency of public investments to the benefit of both the budget and the
economy as a whole. However, it will be critical to ensure full transparency of the budgetary
implications of the entire life of each project, as well as coherence with the broader
budgetary process and public investment priorities. Large investment projects should be
brought into the new PPP framework, because the need for careful project selection and
transparency apply as much, if not more, to them as to smaller projects.
39.
Economic data are adequate for surveillance, but should be strengthened
further. Fiscal data seem to still be in some flux, and comprehensive financing-side data for
the general government would substantially enhance analysis of fiscal developments; better
estimates of the quarterly national accounts are important for up to date assessments of the
economy; and more timely banking system data would improve transparency and market
discipline. Finally, the intention of the National Statistical Service to adopt the new EU
Statistics Code of Practice is welcome, but additionally the Service should be given formal
independence.
40.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

1/ The interpretation of some indicators is affected by participation in EMU in 2001.
2/ Official reserves declined in 2001 with EMU participation, due in large part to the redefinition of foreign exchange reserves and the fall in foreign exchange
reserve requirements for commercial banks.
3/ From 2001, foreign debt includes only liabilities in non-euro area currencies.
4/ Euros per U.S. dollar from 2001.
5/ Data provided by Eurostat.

7/ As from 2001, loans and deposits in euro and its national denominations are not included in foreign exchange loans and foreign exchange deposits respectively.

APPENDIX II

GREECE: STATISTICAL ISSUES

The economic data of Greece are adequate for surveillance, but should be strengthened
further.
Greece has made substantial progress in recent years in statistical methodologies and
compilation practices aimed at fulfilling its responsibilities as a member of the European
Union and the euro area. Greece subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard
(SDDS) on November 8, 2002. It has taken a flexibility option on the periodicity of
central government operations data on financing, which are released annually. A data
module of the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) was prepared
in 2003, and last updated in 2004.
Despite progress, further improvements are necessary. The quality and coverage of
general government public finances and cross-sector data consistency should be
improved, and financial accounts of the government should be prepared. Government
finance and balance of payments statistics should be brought closer to internationally
accepted methodologies. Further progress is needed in providing short-term national
accounts data, with reconciliation across datasets for government finance, monetary, and
balance of payments statistics. Even though all statistics are readily available to the
public, statistical presentations could be improved in most cases to facilitate analysis and
understanding. Service to users could be further enhanced by dissemination of more
detailed metadata including wider identification of compilers in press releases, and by
publicizing contact persons. Most statistics do not provide the public with a clear
statement of the revision policy.
National accounts

National accounts produced by the National Statistical Service of Greece (NSSG) and
based on the 1995 ESA, extend beyond the recommended range of annual tables.
However, in some cases, there is reliance on old benchmark ratios and estimates of
unrecorded activities that are residuals. In addition, quarterly national accounts estimates
from the first quarter of 1970 to the third quarter of 2002 rely more on econometric
estimation than on actual data.
Balance of payments and external trade

The Bank of Greece (BoG) has been involved for a number of years in a comprehensive
revision of balance of payments data on a settlements basis consistent with the fifth
edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). Data for 1999 were first available
under the new system, and estimates for 1997–98 data collected under the previous
system were compiled in the new categories.
Balance of payments data on a monthly basis are compiled and widely disseminated.
Greece reports quarterly balance of payments data and since 2004, has reported quarterly
international investment position (IIP) for publication in the International Financial

- 37 -

APPENDIX II

Statistics (IFS) and the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook. Greece also
disseminates quarterly data on the SDDS prescribed external debt data category and
monthly data on the template on international reserves and foreign currency liquidity.

The balance of payments data series presents some departures from BPM5, but progress
has been made implementing the recommendations of the 2003 data ROSC mission.
Preliminary estimates on reinvested earnings have been made based on data obtained
from the annual foreign direct investment survey; portfolio investment income for bonds
and money market instruments have been recorded on an accrual basis since April 2005;
and a more comprehensive presentation for goods and investment income has been
implemented in accordance with BPM5 guidelines. Significant differences remain in
comparison to national-accounts-based current account data, with sizable differences in
changes (and even in direction) of the current account and its components in recent years.
Government accounts

The NSSG compiles data on general government revenue, expenditure, and deficit on an
accrual basis in the context of the 1995 ESA Transmission Program and the Excessive
Deficit Procedure. The absence of financing data (Greece has a waiver for financial
accounts reporting until 2005) impedes elementary checks on data consistency, including
reconciliation between the government deficit and debt, and between government
statistics and the statistics of other economic sectors. Greece traditionally carries out
substantial capital injections, whose nature must be carefully monitored in order to
determine the proper statistical treatment (above or below the line).
Monthly data for the central government, which are broadly in line with the 1986 GFS
Manual, are very aggregated. The reliability and timeliness of the data on other public
entities, including social security funds and local governments, are poor.
Monetary accounts

Since Greece’s participation in the euro area, monetary statistics have been compiled in
accordance with ECB requirements. Data reporting is timely. Large and volatile reporting
discrepancies among banks’ bilateral positions have lessened from unacceptable levels
experienced up to three years ago but some discrepancies remain and further
improvements could be made to the accuracy and reliability of the source data used to
compile monetary statistics. Cross-checks are made between monetary statistics and
other data, but could be more systematic.
Labor market

Since the fall of 1998, a more detailed quarterly labor force survey has been in use, with
an enlarged sample size, capable of generating data on an EU-harmonized basis.
However, the interpretation of labor market developments continues to be hampered by
difficulties in covering immigrants, which constitute, compared with other EU countries,

- 38 -

APPENDIX II

a relatively large fraction of the Greek labor market. Data on earnings have not been
produced since 1998.
Short-term data

The recent publication of quarterly national accounts is an important improvement in this
area. However, other high-frequency indicators for economic surveillance (including
retail sales, industrial production, wholesale prices, and other indices) are at times based
on out-of-date benchmark ratios and reporting delays seriously undermine the usefulness
of these data. Source data and statistical techniques could be strengthened for prices, and
source data improved for government finance statistics.
Advance release calendars

The NSSG has announced an advance publications schedule for all statistical releases.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
GREECE
Update on the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes—Data Module

Prepared by the European Department
November 2005
This note describes developments in data collection, compilation, and dissemination in
Greece since the last update of the data module of the Report on the Observance of
Standards and Codes (ROSC), which was released in February 2005. It is based on
information supplied by the Greek authorities during the 2005 Article IV consultations.
For a full description of institutions and practices, and IMF staff recommendations, it
should be read in conjunction with the original report and earlier updates. 9

The original ROSC noted that Greece met the SDDS specifications for coverage,
periodicity, and timeliness of data, and of advance release calendars but was using
flexibility options for central government financing operations and the international
investment position. The report also noted that there was no single agency responsible for
compiling comprehensive government finance statistics and there was ample scope for
bringing government finance statistics, national accounts, and balance of payments,
monetary and price statistics closer to international standards.
Greece continues to observe the SDDS specifications for coverage, periodicity, and
timeliness, and has made progress in implementing recommendations in the ROSC.
Below are the main recommendations and corresponding actions that were taken in 2005.
General Recommendations

1.
The ROSC recommended the establishment of procedures for cross checking
consistency among national accounts, government finance, monetary, and balance of
payments statistics; the dissemination of statements about revision policy and practice
and the undertaking of regular revision studies to assess the accuracy of statistics; the
compilation of consistent and comprehensive documentation on concepts and definitions,
scope, classification, basis for recording, source data, and statistical techniques; the
setting up of the Statistical Council, as envisaged under law, to provide guidance on
quality and on improving the serviceability and accessibility of national statistics; and the
9

The original report, entitled “Greece: Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes—Data
Module” was issued as Country Report 03/318 and is available on the IMF website at
http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2003/cr03318.pdf. The first update, issued as Country
Report 05/45, is available at http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2005/cr0545.pdf .

APPENDIX III

institutionalization of regular contacts with users of economic statistics to learn about
their data needs.
• In September 2005, a permanent inter-agency working group was set up to check the
consistency of net borrowing of the various sectors of the economy in the National
and the Financial Accounts. The group comprises representatives from the Ministry of
Economy and Finance, the National Statistical Service of Greece (NSSG), the General
Accounting Office (GAO), and the Bank of Greece (BoG). It is chaired by the
Ministry of National Economy and meets on an ad hoc basis to address issues as they
arise.
• Although the statistical infrastructure is geared primarily towards the needs of the
national authorities and EU institutions (mainly the Eurostat and the ECB), some
effort is made to meet the needs of other users. The dialogue between compilers and
users of statistics is not institutionalized and surveys of the statistical needs of nongovernmental users are not conducted. However, the NSSG conducts semiannual
customer satisfaction surveys. In general, end-users are consulted on an ad hoc basis
and often participate during the development of new statistics; and on several
occasions they have been instrumental in developing new statistics. Recent examples
include BoG statistics on securitized loans and housing loans.
• The revision of the National Statistical Law is underway and is expected to be
completed in 2006. The main elements of the revisions are to strengthen the
independence, accountability and integrity of the NSSG; enhance the confidentiality
policy; and establish a National Statistical Council to provide guidance on improving
the quality, serviceability and accessibility of national statistics. The revision of the
National Statistical Law will also take into account fully the recommendations of the
European Statistical Code of Practice (CoP), put forward by the European
Commission.10
• There are no plans to separate the NSSG from the Ministry of Economics and
Finance. The NSSG staff consider that the basic statistical law (Legislative Degree
3627/1956) grants the NSSG sufficient operational independence. Moreover,
independence would be strengthened by the Statistical Code of Practice, which the
NSSG plans to implement fully over the next three years. Currently, the NSSG has no
code of ethics but plans to introduce one in the context of the revision of the National
Statistical Law.
• The medium-term statistical work programs of the NSSG and the BoG are not
disseminated to the public. Currently, the main priority is to improve the statistical
surveys that form the basis of economic statistics. The work program takes also into
account initiatives at the EU level and recommendations by Eurostat and the ECB.

- 42 -

APPENDIX III

• The NSSG and the BoG disseminate statistical series in text and PDF formats.
In 2005, the BoG started posting on its webpage statistical series in spreadsheet format
and is making preparations for the dissemination of further series in user-friendly
formats.
• In the context of the ECB's project to disseminate national data on a dedicated
website, the BoG posts contact persons for all disseminated data (in addition to the
general contact address), though only in the metadata section of the website.
National Accounts

2.
The ROSC noted the need to improve the short-term source data, reduce the
reliance of statistical techniques on outdated ratios and make the data more accessible by
providing charts, tables, and an analysis of current developments.
•

The preparation of analytic quarterly national accounts is progressing and the first full
set of tables (including data on value added and employment by branch of economic
activity as well as raw and seasonally adjusted series) is expected to be available by
the end of 2006, with data starting from 2000. In this connection, the NSSG has been
developing source databanks that would allow the estimation of quarterly GDP from
both the expenditure and the production side. In addition, the benchmark year for the
national accounts will change to 2000, statistical ratios will be updated accordingly,
and the seasonal adjustment methodology is being reconsidered. Currently, the NSSG
produces only seasonally adjusted quarterly national accounts that have an
inexplicably pronounced seasonal pattern.
•

The NSSG has posted the methodology of compiling national accounts in Greece at
http://www.statistics.gr/MainPage/NationalAccounts/
NationalAccountsMethodology.pdf.

• The revision calendars for both annual and quarterly national accounts are not publicly
available. However, the practice is it to produce each year provisional figures for the
previous year and final ones for the year before. Currently, owing to workload for the
revision of the benchmark year of national accounts, there is a temporary deviation
from the above practice and all national account figures since 2000 remain
provisional.
• National accounts press releases include charts but very limited background
information. For instance, the release of second quarter 2005 national accounts did not
contain any information on the substantial revision of earlier figures. The NSSG is
currently reviewing the content and format of its press releases.
Consumer Price Index

3.
The ROSC recommended the use of modern techniques for dealing with quality
changes and the introduction of statistical sample section methods.

- 43 -

APPENDIX III

• The revision of the consumer price index (CPI) is expected to have been completed in
the beginning of 2006, as originally scheduled. The new index is based on the 2004–
05 Household Budget Survey and the weights of the cities are based on the 2001
population census (price data are collected from 25 cities that are considered to be
representative of wider geographical areas). Currently the NSSG is working on the
composition of the basket. In selecting items for inclusion in the basket, the
representative item method is used. Outlets are selected on a judgmental basis by the
price collectors in consultation with the central unit. As part of the revision, the NSSG
has also been reviewing the data collection process and the quality adjustment
techniques, and taking into consideration Eurostat’s regulations and guidelines. At this
stage, however, the NSSG is not contemplating the introduction of explicit quality
adjustment techniques (hedonics) owing to the high demands that this method would
impose on the statistical infrastructure.
Wholesale Price Index

4.
The ROSC noted the need to (i) improve the timeliness of source data and weight
revisions, (ii) establish a formal process to permit dialogue between compilers and users
on a regular basis, such as users’ survey, and (iii) use sampling techniques to cover small
enterprises.
• In the beginning of 2005, the Producer Price Index (PPI) replaced the Wholesale Price
Index in line with the practice among EU member states. The NSSG considers that the
new index incorporates most of the recommendations made in the ROSC for the WPI.
• In 2006, the NSSG plans to post on its website detailed tabulations for the PPI and the
CPI.
Government Finance Statistics

5.
The ROSC recommended (i) the compilation and dissemination of a full set of
financial accounts for the general government sector and its sub-sectors; (ii) the
compilation and dissemination of monthly financing data for the central government; (iii)
the migration to the GFSM 2001, with ESA 95 data as a starting point for the full
implementation of the system; (iv) the integration of GFS codes and nomenclature in the
Treasury accounting system; (v) the assignment to a single agency the main
responsibility for compiling and disseminating a comprehensive and integrated set of
government finance statistics, including statistics on financing transactions (i.e., financial
accounts); and (vi) the preparation of a periodic publication on government finance
statistics.
• The NSSG revised further the general government debt and deficit figures
for 2001−04 to bring in line with EU guidelines the recording of EU transactions and
liabilities of hospitals. At the time of the consultations, there remained some pending
issues in the recording of EU transactions, the accounts of social security and the
amounts of other receivables and payables for the years 2002−04.

APPENDIX III

• The NSSG is preparing for the migration to GFSM 2001, which is planned for 2006,
and the dissemination of detailed general government finance statistics, including time
series. The project has been delayed by the revision of fiscal accounts. There are no
plans to disseminate general government financing data prior to the migration to
GFSM 2001.
• The NSSG and the BoG have divided the responsibilities for the collection of statistics
and the compilation of financial accounts for Greece. In particular, the NSSG collects
the relevant data for the general government and the BoG collects data for all other
sectors of the economy and compiles the financial accounts. The collection, checking
and processing of quarterly data has already started and the BoG expects to start
publishing financial accounts by end-2005.
• In September 2005, the GAO announced an international call for bids to set up an
integrated fiscal management information system (http://www.mofglk.gr/anakoinwseis/rfpf.zip).
• The transition table from the State Budget to ESA95 is submitted to Eurostat but is not
disseminated to the public.
Monetary Statistics

6.
The ROSC recommended (i) the increase of staff resources in line with the needs
of longer-term statistical work program, including compilation of financial accounts and
improving source data; (ii) improvements in the accuracy of source data and the removal
of inconsistencies in the reports of other monetary and financial institutions (OMFIs);
(iii) the use of consistent terminology and full explanations concerning the inter-temporal
comparability of data and their consolidation; (iv) the identification as a memorandum
item of data on financial derivatives, accrued interest, and claims on and liabilities to
public non-financial corporations.
• The BoG has started collecting statistics for insurance companies, other financial
intermediaries, non-financial corporations, local government, and social security
funds. These data are in the final checking phase and a complete set of Financial
Accounts (both, stocks and flows) is expected to be published by end-2005.
• Further progress was made in 2005 in reducing inconsistencies in the reports of
OMFIs. The inconsistencies between data reported by OMFIs and those reported by
the BoG on OMFIs’ assets and liabilities vis-à-vis the BoG reflect mainly timing
differences (float) and are bypassed by using data reported by the BoG and adjusting
accordingly figures reported by OMFIs. By increasing pressure on banks to improve
the quality of their reports, “other items” of OMFIs were reduced from 2.3% of total
assets in 2004 to 1.4 percent in 2005. Regarding assets and liabilities between OMFIs,
institutions have been requested to pay greater attention to the timing of their
interbank assets and liabilities. As a result, the discrepancy between interbank assets
and liabilities has been reduced significantly and currently fluctuates around
2.3 percent of total inter-OMFI assets.

APPENDIX III

Balance of Payments Statistics

7.
The ROSC recommended (i) introducing estimates for reinvested earnings and
undistributed branch profits into the balance of payments statistics; and (ii) reporting on
an accrual basis of data on interest payments for government debt.
• Since July 2005, transfers are decomposed into current and capital, and the
presentation of the current account has been changed accordingly: it now comprises
the trade balance, services balance, income account, and current transfers. Capital
transfers appear separately in the balance of payments.
• Since April 2005, interest payments/receipts on government debt have been reported
on an accrual basis with data as of December 2003.
• The BoG has finalized annual figures of reinvested earnings (for both inward and
outward FDI) for 2003 and compiled first estimates for 2004. These data will be
incorporated in revised annual balance of payments statistics that are expected to
released by the end of 2005.
• The BoG is currently developing a statistical model for estimating monthly balance of
payments indicators.
• The BoG has a medium term objective to disseminate detailed information for main
balance of payments items, for instance, a breakdown of goods by product and
country, and of travel by country.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
GREECE
Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European Department
Approved by Michael Deppler and Juha Kähkönen
December 8, 2005
1.
This supplement updates staff fiscal projections for 2006, based on information
received after the staff report was finalized. In addition, the Public Information Notice is
attached. This supplement does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
The authorities, in the draft budget submitted to parliament and in a submission to the
EU, both on November 21, reaffirmed their commitment to reduce the deficit to 2.6 percent
of GDP in 2006. The information in these documents is consistent with the staff report, but
the nature of the unspecified revenue measures discussed in paragraph 11 has been clarified:
they are tax revenue enhancements and temporary non-tax revenues. As foreshadowed in the
report, staff projects that if the adopted measures produce revenues in line with the
authorities’ expectations, which appears feasible, the 2006 general government budget deficit
will fall to 2.7 percent of GDP.
3.
The key aspects of revenue enhancement are measures to combat tax evasion and
improvements in collection. These include a campaign to raise public awareness of penalties
for tax evasion, more comprehensive cross-checking of invoices, intensified and better
targeted audits, improved auditing information systems, and mandatory filing of periodic
(every 1 or 3 months, depending on the class of business) VAT returns. Such initiatives are
fully consistent with the recommendations of the Fund technical assistance mission on tax
administration and, in this connection, the high level task force examining these
recommendations has already offered its first proposals to the Minister of Finance. The
temporary non-tax measures, accounting for about one-third (0.6 percent of GDP, as
indicated in the staff report) of the deficit reduction in 2006, comprise extra dividends from
three government-owned financial institutions sale, extension of concession rights, and
clearance of fines and licenses by the Telecommunications and Post Commission.
Securitization of tax arrears, which had been discussed at the time of the Article IV mission,
will not take place in 2005 and has not been included as revenue in the 2006 budget.

Statement by Miranda Xafa, Alternate Executive Director for Greece
December 14, 2005

On behalf of my authorities, I would like to thank staff for their high-quality reports and for
their close involvement with Greece in the past year. This included, besides the annual
Article IV report, two technical assistance missions from FAD, a full fiscal ROSC, and
Greece’s first FSAP. The authorities are most appreciative of staff’s efforts, whose
recommendations are an invaluable input in Greece’s policy-making process. They share
much of staff’s analysis, including on the challenges in the years ahead; we therefore limit
our remarks to a few key points.
Key challenges
The key challenge is to make significant further progress in fiscal consolidation while
sustaining the post-Olympics growth rate beyond the immediate future. The authorities are
convinced that fiscal consolidation adds to growth over the medium term, by releasing
resources from debt service to the financing of private sector activities and thus “crowding
in” private investment. However, they are keen to avoid a vicious circle of low
growth/revenue shortfall that would jeopardize the fiscal adjustment effort. They are thus
trying to strike the right balance between sustaining domestic demand while pursuing fiscal
consolidation efforts. This strategy has paid off so far, as GDP growth remained well above
the Euro-area average in 2005 while significant fiscal adjustment was achieved.
Going forward, the authorities are aware of risks to growth but remain more optimistic than
staff on the outlook for 2006 and beyond, based on the expectation that supply-side reforms
will boost growth. For 2006, the GDP growth forecast underlying budget projections (3.8
percent versus 3.3 percent in staff projections) is partly based on leading indicators pointing
to continued strong growth momentum. In particular, building permits have increased sharply
in anticipation of the imposition of VAT on new construction as of 2006, and earnings of
listed companies have risen strongly in the first 9 months of 2005 partly as a result of a cut in
corporate tax rates, while credit growth and retail sales remain strong.
Fiscal adjustment in 2005-06
The authorities’ strategy to achieve the needed fiscal consolidation under the EDP has relied
almost entirely on spending cuts and growth-enhancing reforms rather than on tax increases.
To this effect:
1. Fiscal adjustment in 2005 amounted to 2.3 percent of GDP, of which 0.4 percentage
points from current expenditure reduction, 1.4 pps from investment expenditure reduction
(including 1 pp of non-recurrent spending on Olympic Games infrastructure), and 0.5 pps
from improvements in the general government accounts. The general government deficit is
estimated to have declined from its peak of 6.6 percent of GDP in 2004 (compared with an
initial estimate of 5.3 percent) to 4.3 percent in 2005.

-22. Fiscal adjustment in 2006, based on the 2006 draft budget submitted to Parliament on
November 21 (after the staff report was issued), amounts to a further 1.7 percent of GDP,
leading to a further decline in the general government deficit from 4.3 percent in 2005 to 2.6
percent in 2006. Within this total, permanent measures would amount to 1.1 percent of GDP,
including interest savings of 0.4 percent of GDP as maturing debt is rolled over at lower
rates, while one-off measures would amount to 0.6 percent of GDP. The one-off measures
consist mainly of higher dividends from state-controlled banks reflecting higher profits, and
proceeds of concession rights on roads, airports, and casinos.
Structural fiscal reforms
One-off revenue enhancements obviously cannot substitute for fundamental reform, but they
can help gain time until fundamental reforms, which take time to plan and implement, start
having a measurable impact. The authorities have an ambitious structural reform agenda in
the fiscal area, which hopefully will start bearing fruit in coming years:
1. The authorities invited two technical assistance missions from the Fund earlier this year on
Tax Administration and Public Expenditure Management. As mentioned by staff, highlevel task forces have been formed to follow up on the Fund’s recommendations and to
propose a reform agenda and timetable by end-December. The authorities’ requests for
technical assistance and for a full fiscal ROSC signal their strong commitment to enhance the
effectiveness and transparency of fiscal management. Most importantly, multi-year
budgeting under consideration would replace year-at-a-time decision-making on the fiscal
stance by a rules-based system aimed at achieving a zero budget deficit over the medium
term. On the revenue side, some of the Fund’s recommendations, including obligatory
periodic filing of VAT returns, are already being implemented.
2. There is an urgent need to impose hard budget constraints on public enterprises and
entities. Some enterprises continue to operate while generating losses, defaulting on their
debt to banks and accumulating arrears to the tax authorities and social security
organizations. Similarly, public entities such as hospitals accumulate arrears to suppliers that
are eventually taken over by the government, as was done this year, adding to the public
debt. The government has submitted to Parliament a draft law on public enterprises, aimed at
increasing their commercial orientation and significantly reducing their reliance on budget
transfers. Similarly, efforts are underway to help gain control over the finances of the health
care system inter alia by centralizing and reforming their procurement practices.
3. Even though the authorities are taking measures to bring the deficit of the general
government down to below 3 percent of GDP in 2006, the aging of the population and its
impact on pensions imposes further challenges. They therefore agree with staff that, in the
absence of corrective measures, pension and health care costs threaten long-term fiscal
sustainability. As staff notes, the government is not planning legislative reforms during its
present term in office, but has invited the Economic and Social Council, representing
employers and labor unions, to commission an actuarial study and initiate a public debate
that would facilitate public acceptance of eventual reform measures. The authorities invited
Fund staff last year to prepare their own pension projections (included in the Selected Issues

-3paper), and promoted data-gathering and analysis on an ongoing basis by making the
recently-created Greek Actuarial Authority operational this year.
Growth-oriented reforms
As experience elsewhere shows, raising potential growth and improving debt sustainability
requires action in a number of areas. Despite the economy’s strong growth record in recent
years, the government is convinced that Greece can do significantly better in unlocking its
economic potential and reducing its unemployment rate. It is therefore taking steps to
improve the business environment, increase competition, and reduce costs in sectors
dominated by the public sector, such as transport, telecoms, energy and health. It is also
aiming to make Greece a more attractive destination for foreign direct investment to help
fulfill its potential as a regional hub, increase its outward orientation and reap the benefits of
rapid advances in technology. To this end, the authorities have:
•

Introduced labor market reforms to increase labor market flexibility, including a
reduction in overtime pay and more flexible workweek arrangements to accommodate
seasonal peaks in demand with lower recourse to overtime.

•

Cut corporate taxes from 35 to 25 percent over three years and are planning to reduce
personal income taxes in order to align the top marginal income tax rate more closely
with the corporate tax rate, thus avoiding tax arbitrage and encouraging compliance.

•

Introduced an investment incentives law, in effect since January 2005, providing for
tax credits and other investment incentives to promote job creation, skills upgrading,
R&D and innovation.

•

Introduced legislation governing PPPs, in effect since mid-2005, to facilitate private
sector involvement in public investment projects with due attention to the fiscal side
of such concessions.

•

Taken steps to deregulate product markets and promote competition; shopping hours
have been liberalized and the Competition Commission’s power to prevent the abuse
of dominant positions and the distortion of competition has been strengthened. Draft
legislation to deregulate the energy sector will be tabled soon.

•

Taken steps to promote diffusion of ICT productivity gains and accelerate investment
in broadband networks.

FSAP
The Greek authorities welcomed the FSAP as a unique opportunity to streamline their
ongoing efforts to adapt to a rapidly evolving international environment, including the
adoption of IFRS, Basel II, and EU directives on financial system integration. The FSAP
encouraged a thorough self-assessment of supervisory strengths and weaknesses, and
identification of policy priorities. The formalistic incorporation of EU directives and Basel II

-4mandates would not suffice for the supervisory authorities to stay a step ahead of
increasingly sophisticated financial markets and manage the ever-evolving challenges ahead.
Greece’s AML/CFT system was in the process of being revamped at the time of the
assessment to comply with new global standards, and the revised law was voted by
Parliament on November 30, 2005. The authorities acknowledge the contribution of the
Fund’s recommendations in designing the new framework so as to address administrative
weaknesses and maximize its effectiveness in curtailing money laundering and terrorism
financing.
The FSAP confirms that the banking system, which accounts for about 80 percent of the
financial sector, is well capitalized and profitable. Risk-management systems have improved
significantly and stress tests confirm that Greek banks are adequately protected from market
and credit risk. As regards the adoption of IFSR, the need for certain state-controlled banks
to include unfunded pension liabilities in their balance sheets has been addressed through a
capital increase where needed and by the mandatory transfer of a part of these liabilities to
the main pension fund, IKA.
Rapid credit growth following liberalization of consumer credit and interest rate convergence
in the run-up to EMU is a concern, as it has increased the banking sector’s exposure to credit
risk. This risk may rise further as the ratio of household debt to GDP catches up with the EU
average. However, as the FSAP acknowledges, the Bank of Greece has taken steps to address
this concern by raising specific provisions and capitalization levels, mandating riskmanagement and credit-rating systems in banks, and facilitating the compilation of
comprehensive credit information on individual borrowers.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with
Greece
On December 14, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Greece.1
Background
Economic growth has been very strong for several years, underpinned by a large fall in interest
rates due to adoption of the euro and subsequent ECB easing, rapid increases in private
sector credit following the liberalization of the financial sector, and an expansionary fiscal
stance. In 2005, with the end of Olympics spending and an associated sharp fiscal tightening,
real GDP growth slowed to an estimated 3½ percent, still strong by international comparison.
The long economic expansion has been accompanied by the appearance of macroeconomic
imbalances. The fiscal position deteriorated significantly. In 2004, the general government
deficit rose to 6.6 percent of GDP, the primary balance shifted into deficit, and public debt
stood at 111 percent of GDP. Inflation has been running persistently above the euro-area
average, resulting in a gradual but steady erosion of competitiveness and a decline in export
market shares. And, despite the extended period of strong growth, labor market performance
remains sub-par, with a high unemployment rate and low participation rates.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2In 2005, the authorities implemented substantial fiscal consolidation, reducing the budget
deficit to 4.6 percent of GDP on staff calculations. Public sector investment spending
contracted with the end of the Olympics, current spending growth slowed sharply, though from
high rates, and interest costs fell. The draft 2006 budget contains further measures to bring the
deficit to a targeted 2.6 percent of GDP, consistent with Greece’s commitments to the EU
under the excessive deficit procedure. However, about one-third of the 2006 adjustment
consists of temporary measures.
The rising fiscal costs of population aging are the key long-term threat to debt sustainability.
Available estimates imply these costs will rise by more in Greece than in any other EU country
between now and 2050. In the absence of strong corrective action to put pensions and health
care on a sustainable footing, the result will be an explosive path of the public debt.
Economic growth in 2006 and beyond is likely to be moderate compared to the high rates
enjoyed in previous years, though it should remain comfortably above the euro-area average.
The erosion of international competitiveness, needed fiscal consolidation, and the gradual
waning of the effects of euro-area entry and financial liberalization all suggest growth will slow.
The outlook depends, however, on developments in Greece’s export markets, notably the
shipping and tourism sectors, the EU, and on the evolution of the price of oil.
The banking system, which dominates the financial sector, appears well capitalized and
profitable. However, several years of rapid growth in private sector lending, albeit from low
levels, raises concerns that credit quality may deteriorate unexpectedly should the economy
slow substantially or interest rates rise sharply, and non-performing loan ratios are already
high for this stage of the business cycle. The Bank of Greece, the supervisor, has responded
to risks by strengthening the prudential framework, and commercial banks have also improved
their risk management capacity. The insurance sector, though not systemically important, is
weak and poorly supervised.
The authorities have recently introduced a number of significant structural measures to
improve product and labor markets. These include reductions in the corporate tax rate, unified
and extended shopping hours, more flexible overtime, a new competition law and a
strengthened competition authority, further liberalization of gas and electricity markets,
simplification of business licensing, and a new framework for public-private partnerships. More
initiatives are planned, including revision to bankruptcy legislation and changes to
management and employment contracts in state-owned enterprises.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors welcomed the extended period of strong economic growth, underpinned by low
interest rates following adoption of the euro, rapid credit expansion in the wake of financial
sector liberalization, and high investment and productivity growth. As a result, the longstanding
gap in living standards between Greece and the euro-area average, while still wide, has
narrowed significantly in recent years. Directors also observed, however, that imbalances have
built up during the economic boom, with a marked deterioration in the fiscal position and a
gradual but steady loss of competitiveness against the euro area as a result of a persistent
inflation differential.

-3Looking forward, Directors agreed that Greece’s economic prospects remain promising,
especially if structural reforms are implemented vigorously. Nevertheless, growth is likely to
moderate somewhat from the high rates seen recently, reflecting the erosion of
competitiveness, the waning of the stimulus from euro-area entry and past financial-sector
reform, and needed fiscal consolidation.
Against a background of Greece’s very high debt level and prospective large aging costs,
Directors stressed that fiscal consolidation is the top economic policy priority for Greece.
They commended the authorities’ substantial reduction of the budget deficit in 2005 and their
objective of cutting it further to below 3 percent of GDP in 2006. Directors urged the authorities
to implement additional and durable measures to contain current spending and reach fiscal
balance by the end of the decade. They considered that strong reforms to expenditure
management and tax administration would be essential to achieving this medium-term goal.
Key priorities include improving auditing, strengthening information management systems,
streamlining the control of spending, better prioritizing expenditure, developing risk-based tax
assessment and enforcement, and strengthening measures to collect tax arrears. In addition, a
multi-year fiscal framework would enhance fiscal policy planning and credibility. In this
connection, Directors welcomed the measures already taken by the authorities, especially to
reform tax administration and strengthen revenue collection. They encouraged full and timely
implementation of the recommendations of the recent Fund technical assistance missions on
tax administration and public expenditure management, as well as the recommendations of the
Fiscal Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes. A number of Directors also
supported the authorities’ decision not to follow through with their plans to securitize tax
arrears, emphasizing the one-off nature of such a measure.
Directors noted the projected large increases in pension and health costs owing to population
aging, and highlighted the threat this would pose to long-term debt sustainability. While
welcoming steps taken to raise awareness of the issue and involve the social partners,
Directors called on the authorities to accelerate preparation of pension reforms, in order to
ensure their early implementation, including by updating projections of the fiscal costs
associated with aging as soon as possible. They also urged that recent reforms to the health
care system be followed up to help contain prospective cost pressures.
Directors welcomed the FSAP report’s conclusion that commercial banks are well capitalized,
profitable, and soundly supervised, and encouraged the authorities to fully implement the
report’s recommendations. They noted, however, that, after years of rapid credit growth, credit
risks might prove unexpectedly high, especially in the event of an economic downturn or a
significant increase in interest rates. Moreover, Greek banks are relatively small and have a
high cost structure. Given these circumstances, Directors called for continued strengthening of
the supervisory framework, close monitoring of bank assets and non-performing loans, and
further development of commercial banks’ risk management practices. Directors also observed
that the insurance sector is weak and poorly supervised, and urged the authorities to make the
new insurance supervisor fully operational and independent as soon as possible.
Directors agreed that a key long-term policy challenge is to improve productivity and
competitiveness, thereby fostering high economic growth and raising living standards.
They commended the authorities on recent structural reforms in the product and labor
markets, notably lower corporate tax rates, more flexible shopping hours, easing of overtime

-4restrictions, a new competition law and a strengthened competition authority, gas and
electricity liberalization, and simplification of business licensing. Directors encouraged the
authorities to build on this foundation by simplifying the tax system and overhauling tax
administration, cutting red tape for businesses, further liberalizing gas and electricity, and
ensuring that the competition authority becomes more proactive.
On labor markets, where less reform has taken place despite the chronically high
unemployment rate and low participation, Directors called for further easing of hiring and firing
restrictions and more flexibility in minimum wages, especially in sectors facing economic
pressures. Directors also expressed concern about the medium-term effects of the ongoing
loss of international competitiveness. They stressed that, to stem the loss, the social partners
will need to limit wage growth to Greek productivity growth and euro-area inflation.
Directors welcomed proposed reforms to state-owned enterprises and the new framework law
for public-private partnerships. They judged that better governance of state-owned enterprises
and more flexible employment conditions would help to improve service levels, reduce losses,
and pave the way for further privatization where appropriate. Public private partnerships could
help to foster needed infrastructure investment. Directors emphasized, however, that
transparent and full accounting would be central to the proper assessment of current and
future fiscal costs of projects, and that large public investment projects should be brought
under the framework.
Directors welcomed improvements to economic data, especially to the fiscal data in the wake
of last year’s fiscal audit carried out by the authorities in cooperation with Eurostat. At the
same time, they considered that further strengthening would be desirable. In particular,
strengthened reporting of fiscal data, including the publication of financing-side fiscal data, will
help increase the credibility of fiscal policy. Also important will be improved quarterly national
accounts data, which are under preparation, and formal independence for the statistical
service.
