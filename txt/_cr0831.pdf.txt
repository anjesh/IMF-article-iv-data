Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2007 Article IV
Consultation with Colombia
Approved by Caroline Atkinson and Michael T. Hadjimichael
December 21, 2007
Executive Summary
Economic context: Colombia’s economic strategy since 1999 has yielded considerable
success. Growth has been above the Latin American average over the past three years,
supported by structural reforms and prudent macroeconomic policies. Colombia has
weathered well the recent turbulence in global financial markets. Large capital inflows,
primarily comprising foreign direct investment, have contributed to an appreciation of the
real exchange rate. In light of the improved security situation and continued commitment of
the government to sound macroeconomic policies and further structural reforms, long-term
economic growth in the neighborhood of about 5 percent per year appears feasible.
Challenges: The rapid pace of activity in 2006 and 2007 has resulted in overheating
pressures, which have been manifested in higher inflation and an increase in the external
current account deficit to 4 percent of GDP, one of the highest in the region. The authorities
are targeting a gradual reduction of growth to a more sustainable level in 2008 and beyond,
which will help ease inflationary pressures and reduce the external current account deficit.
Achieving this soft landing will require the firm application of prudent macroeconomic
policies to slow down the growth of domestic demand.
Staff’s views: While the short-term outlook is promising, a tighter fiscal policy stance could
help alleviate overheating pressures and diminish risks and vulnerabilities, including from
the relatively high external current account deficit. At the same time, it would accelerate the
decline in public debt and improve prospects for achieving the government’s goal of
recovering investment grade status. A further deepening of the structural reform agenda
would also help underpin long-term growth prospects.
Authorities’ views: The authorities broadly shared the staff’s assessment, while pointing to
uncertainty about the size of the output gap and the strength of excess demand pressures.
They viewed the risks associated with the high current account deficit as manageable. The
staff recommendation to implement further fiscal adjustment would be taken under
consideration.

I. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
1.
Colombia’s economic strategy since 1999 has yielded considerable success.
Structural reforms have advanced in a wide range of areas, and prudent macroeconomic
policies have resulted in a declining trend in inflation and public debt ratios, while the
financial system has been strengthened. Unemployment and poverty rates have fallen.
2.
Colombia’s recent economic growth has been especially strong, contributing to
overheating pressures.
•

Economic growth in 2005–06 exceeded
the Latin American average and, at close
to 7 percent in 2006 and the first half of
2007, equaled its fastest pace since the late
1970s. Growth is projected at 6¾ percent
for the year as a whole. The Banco de la
República (BdR) estimates a positive
output gap for the second quarter of 2007
of about 3 percent. Unemployment, while
still high, has fallen below estimates of the
natural rate (Figure 1).

So urce: IM F staff estimates.
Inflation rose from 4½ percent in
December 2006 to 6¼ percent in April
(y/y), reflecting excess demand pressures and a surge in food prices (Figure 2). While
inflation has declined in recent months as the food price shock unwinds and the
effects of monetary tightening begin to take hold, it is projected to close the year at
about 5¼ percent, outside the BdR’s target range of 3½–4½ percent. Inflation in the
nontraded sector (excluding food and regulated prices)—a good measure of
underlying overheating pressures—was 5¼ percent in November, up from 4¾ percent
in December 2006.

•

Imports grew at over 27 percent (y/y) through September, contributing to a projected
doubling in the current account deficit to 4 percent of GDP for 2007 (Figure 3).

•

Credit growth has cooled slightly in the past few months, but as of October remained
high at 27 percent (y/y, based on gross loan data).

3.
Strong capital inflows intensified pressures for currency appreciation in the first
half of 2007, which the authorities tried to resist with heavy foreign exchange (FX)
intervention and capital controls.
•

The nominal exchange rate vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, and the real effective rate,
appreciated sharply in the first half of the year (Figure 4). The authorities attempted
to alleviate these pressures during January–April with sterilized intervention
amounting to US$4.5 billion (38 percent of base money). Since end-April, however,
the BdR has not intervened, indicating that sterilized foreign currency purchases had
become more difficult over time, and that continued intervention would have
compromised achieving its inflation objectives.1

•

In May, capital controls were implemented with an unremunerated reserve
requirement (URR) of 40 percent on external borrowing and portfolio inflows. To
limit inflows seeking to take advantage of interest rate differentials, a ceiling on
banks’ gross positions in derivative markets was also imposed. Capital inflows have
slowed, although this also reflected other developments. Capital controls were
relaxed somewhat in mid-December.

4.
Monetary policy has aimed to restrain strong demand growth and contain rising
inflation, while the fiscal stance has been neutral. The BdR has raised its policy interest
rate to 9½ percent (a 350 basis point increase since April 2006). With lending rates and credit
growth showing little response to monetary tightening through early 2007, and inflation still
high, the BdR also imposed an unremunerated reserve requirement on new deposits in May.
For the central government, the fiscal deficit is projected to decline in 2007, and the primary
structural balance is expected to improve. For the nonfinancial public sector (NFPS),
however, the primary structural balance is projected to remain broadly unchanged following
a weakening in 2006 (Figure 5).
5.
Overheating pressures are expected to ease in the wake of monetary tightening.
Reflecting in part the new unremunerated reserve requirement, lending rates have risen
sharply since mid-2007 and are at 6-year highs in real terms. For the second half of the year,
the economy is projected to expand at about 5 percent. There are already incipient signs of a
slowdown in the second quarter, particularly in construction. Third quarter figures on
industrial production also suggest an easing of the pace of activity.

1

Chapter 3 of the Selected Issues paper concludes that discretionary intervention in 2007 had no lasting effect
on the exchange rate, owing in part to market expectations that monetary policy would remain committed to
reducing inflation.

Structural fiscal reforms have advanced over the past year. Corporate income tax
rates will fall from 38½ percent in 2006 to 33 percent in 2008; the tax on outward profit
remittances of 7 percent is being phased out, as well as the stamp tax on bank loans. A
reform of the intergovernmental transfer system is expected to help maintain central
government transfers broadly constant as a share of GDP through 2012. Energy subsidies
have been reduced, while the issuance of new shares in the state oil company
(ECOPETROL)—worth 10 percent of the firm—was completed in August, and steps to place
the enterprise on a commercial basis were completed and endorsed by a shareholder
assembly in November. An additional 10 percent of shares will be issued in 2008.
7.
Colombia has weathered well the recent turbulence in global markets. Equity
prices and spreads have moved broadly in line with regional averages (Figure 6). There have
been no disruptions to debt markets. The exchange rate has been allowed to respond flexibly
in recent months, and the nominal effective rate depreciated by 6 percent between mid-July
and early December.

II. OUTLOOK FOR 2008 AND THE MEDIUM TERM
8.
The authorities aim to achieve a “soft landing” from the economic boom. The
authorities are targeting a gradual reduction of growth to a more sustainable level over the
remainder of 2007 and beyond, which they expect to achieve through tight monetary policy.
This would, in turn, lead to a reduction in inflation toward the long-term target of
2–4 percent. Over the medium term, they expect growth to average 5 percent, fueled by
continued high rates of private investment. Fiscal deficits would average about 1 percent of
GDP and public debt would continue to decline. The external current account deficit would
also ease over the medium term.

9.
Staff projections indicate these objectives are broadly within reach. The
continued tight stance of monetary policy is expected to help ease the pace of economic
growth to 5 percent in 2008 and beyond. Inflation is projected to decline to 4.3 percent by
end-December 2008, within the BdR’s target for 2008 of 3½–4½ percent. Inflation is
projected to decline slowly over the medium term, in line with the gradual closing of the
output gap. The current account deficit is forecast to rise in 2008, in part owing to a
temporary spike in security-related imports. Thereafter, it is expected to decline slowly with
the unwinding of cyclical factors and prudent macroeconomic policies. The improvement in
the external current account would reflect an increase in public savings and a reduction in
private investment from its peak levels during the boom of 2006–07.

The external environment, however, poses an important risk to the outlook in
the near term. Staff estimates that a 1 percent reduction in world growth reduces Colombian

13
output by about 1½ percent—more than the Latin American average of about 1 percent.2 A
sudden reduction in demand from Venezuela would particularly weaken growth and the
external accounts. A reduction in exports to Venezuela to the 2005 level, for example, would
reduce receipts by about 1½ percent of GDP.3 Colombia compares well to the emerging
market average on most vulnerability indicators, although external debt sustainability
analysis indicates a relatively high degree of sensitivity to a real exchange rate shock (Table
A1). Public debt is below the emerging market average, but higher than average for emerging
market countries at investment grade.

Domestic risks are also important, including for inflation and the current
account. Staff views the risks for the projection for inflation and the current account as
slanted to the upside. The economy may not slow as quickly as envisaged, resulting in higher
inflation and a larger current account deficit than expected.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
14.
Against this background, the discussions focused on four interrelated areas, in line
with the 2007 surveillance decision:
•

An assessment of external stability and the level of the real effective exchange rate;

•

Policy options for achieving and maintaining external and domestic stability;

•

The appropriate mix of monetary and fiscal policy for achieving a soft landing; and

•

An assessment of financial stability in light of the recent turbulence in global
financial markets.

External stability and the real exchange rate
15.
The increase in the external current account deficit reflects mostly the cyclical
position of the economy. Both the authorities and staff envisage that prudent
macroeconomic policies will ease domestic overheating pressures and reduce the growth of
imports from the rapid pace of the past two years. Over the next five years, the current
account is expected to improve as cyclical and temporary factors unwind, matched by a
decline in public and private capital inflows. Adjusting for cyclical factors, staff estimates
that the underlying current account deficit for 2007 is 2½–3 percent of GDP, similar to its
estimate of the sustainable long-run equilibrium level (see Boxes 1 and 2). This assessment is
consistent with the staff’s analysis of the real effective exchange rate, which suggests that the
real rate is in line with fundamentals. Reducing the current account deficit toward this longrun equilibrium level will nevertheless require judicious management of macroeconomic
policies to slow the current rapid growth of domestic demand and imports.
16.
The authorities considered the risks posed by its growing dependence on exports
to Venezuela as manageable. The authorities viewed export growth to Venezuela as likely
to remain robust in the short term, even if oil prices eased from their current high levels. At
the same time, in order to further diversify trade and reduce dependence on any one country,
they were actively pursuing free trade agreements (FTAs) with a broad range of trade
partners. This included the FTA with the United States, whose approval by the U.S. Congress
is still pending.

16

Box 1. Estimating the Underlying Current Account Balance in Colombia
The methodology for assessing the underlying current account captures the temporary factors
influencing both the trade balance and income flows. The table below shows the adjustment factors to the
projected current account balance, based on econometric estimates of the influence of cyclical developments. A
positive adjustment factor implies that the underlying current account is stronger than its present level. For
example, a positive output gap in Colombia in 2007 is leading to a high level of imports relative to a cyclicallyneutral position. Summing positive and negative adjustments together, the underlying current account in 2007
is estimated to be 2½–3 percent of GDP.

Box 2. Assessments of the Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate and Current Account
The peso appreciated rapidly in the first half of 2007. The nominal effective rate (NEER) appreciated by
18 percent from end-2006 through mid-June. Most of this has been reversed in the wake of recent global
turbulence, but as of end-November, the NEER had still appreciated by about 7 percent since the beginning of
the year.

A country-specific model of the equilibrium real exchange rate suggests that the value of the peso is
consistent with fundamentals.1 The model suggests that improvements in fundamentals—e.g., strong
commodity prices and improved security—explain more than 40 percent of the appreciation since 2003. The
remainder of the change can be explained by a reversal of the estimated undervaluation. The actual exchange
rate, as of November, is at the point estimate of the equilibrium rate.
Alternative approaches also suggest the real exchange rate is in line with fundamentals. On average, panel
estimates under the three methods for the CGER—based on the average exchange rate for November—suggest
that the real rate is within 0–10 percent of its equilibrium value.2
The real exchange rate is consistent with the staff estimate of the equilibrium current account deficit
(2½–3 percent of GDP). Foreign direct investment (FDI) has increased sharply as a result of the improved
business environment. This increase implies a reduction in net foreign assets (NFA) towards the emerging
market average. In light of this, staff estimates the equilibrium current account deficit at about 2½–3 percent of
GDP.
Other indicators suggest competitiveness remains strong. Developments in the REER, based on unit labor
costs, closely track those of the CPI-based REER and indicate the current rate is close to its historical average.
The continued strong growth of nontraditional exports (which surged by 20 percent (y/y) in the first three
quarters of 2007) also suggests that the external sector remains competitive.

pattern. The authorities noted that FDI was
attracted not only by export opportunities, improved security, and high commodity prices,
but by Colombia’s large domestic market, which should help provide some stability to these
flows going forward.
Policies for achieving and maintaining external and domestic stability
18.
The authorities concurred that overheating pressures remained a key challenge.
They broadly agreed with staff on the macroeconomic outlook, while pointing to uncertainty
about the size of the output gap and the strength of excess demand pressures.
19.
The staff encouraged the authorities to incorporate fiscal adjustment into the
policy mix. Staff suggested that fiscal consolidation could help alleviate overheating
pressures—especially in terms of lowering the external current account deficit—and reduce
the burden on monetary policy for demand management. This policy mix would also help
reduce upward pressures on the currency associated with monetary tightening and capital
inflows.
Fiscal policy
20.
The authorities are targeting a broadly neutral stance in 2007, followed by a
fiscal expansion in 2008. Fiscal balances are projected to remain broadly unchanged in
2007. Despite firm control of discretionary current expenditures, rising outlays for pensions
and a one-off increase in security spending are projected to weaken the structural primary
balance by 1 percentage point of GDP in 2008.
21.
Staff recommended a fiscal adjustment of ½–1 percent of GDP compared to the
authorities’ 2008 budget. Under the scenario proposed by the mission, the CPS deficit
would be no more than ½–1 percent of GDP in 2008. Assuming a 1 percent of GDP
adjustment, the staff’s estimates suggest that the external current account deficit would be
reduced by about ½ percentage point of GDP below the baseline for 2008 and beyond.

A stronger fiscal stance would also accelerate debt reduction and improve
prospects for a rapid return to investment grade rating. Under the staff scenario, the
primary structural balance would remain broadly constant over 2007–12. This tighter stance
would allow public debt to fall to below 30 percent of GDP by 2011, which would further
increase the resilience of the Colombian economy to an uncertain global environment.4 The
staff agreed that there was no single public debt target (as a percent of GDP) to anchor fiscal
policy, although some studies estimate that debt levels greater than 25 percent may be
vulnerable.5 The authorities noted they would give consideration to the staff’s proposal to

raise the primary balance by 1 percentage point of GDP over the next two years, and
reiterated their commitment to continue to save any overperformance on revenues relative to
the budget.
Structural fiscal reforms
23.
The commercialization of ECOPETROL is an important reform that will
further strengthen Colombia’s long-term growth prospects. A sizable program of
investment is now underway, financed by the issuance of shares to the private sector. The
investment program is expected to lead to an increase in ECOPETROL’s production by onethird between 2007 and 2011. Staff considers that the authorities have taken the required
steps to place ECOPETROL’s operations on a commercial basis, and that the fiscal risk
posed by the enterprise is low.6 Staff thus agreed that starting in 2008, ECOPETROL could
be taken out of the fiscal indicators used to measure the fiscal policy stance, such the overall
public sector deficit. These efforts have closely followed those undertaken to commercialize
a national electricity company (ISA), which was subsequently removed from fiscal indicators
under the Fund-supported program in 2004.
24.
Staff recommended that information on ECOPETROL’s operations nevertheless
continue to be reported in budget documents. Given that the government remains the
majority owner of the enterprise, and for reasons of fiscal transparency, it would still be
useful to also report a combined public sector balance that includes ECOPETROL. The
authorities agreed that operations on all public enterprises could be included in budget
documents, but were not convinced of the need to provide an overall balance figure that
included these firms.

advanced. The private sector is taking an increasingly important role in the management of

As of November 2007, the authorities had taken all the remaining steps to place ECOPETROL’s operations
on a commercial basis. These included (i) removing the financial burden of the fuel subsidy from the enterprise
to the budget; (ii) ensuring adequate protection of minority shareholder rights; and (iii) providing the firm the
same independence as the private sector in personnel decisions.

21
public health insurance and the provision of health services. This has resulted in a sizable
reduction in administrative costs and is expected to improve the efficiency of the public
health system.
26.
Efforts to move forward on privatization are also underway, and a discussion on
trade reform has been initiated. The government is assessing the timetable for a possible
privatization of two national electricity companies (ISA and ISAGEN). Initial proposals for
rationalization of the import tariff structure were discussed with the private sector in
November. The staff noted the importance of including import-competing sectors in the tariff
reductions, as envisaged under the government’s original proposal, to avoid an increase in
effective rates of protection.
27.

The staff recommended a further deepening of the reform agenda:

•

On tax reform, important items in the original proposal excluded from the 2006
reform, notably a more aggressive reduction in the number VAT rates and tax
exemptions, could be reexamined. In addition, a reduction of payroll taxation, and the
elimination of the financial transactions tax, could be considered. While broadly
agreeing on the desirability of these reforms, the authorities saw little political scope
for moving forward in the near future.

•

Reducing revenue earmarking and budget rigidities. Revenue earmarking and
mandatory expenditure continue to hamper budget management, and options to
alleviate these rigidities should continue to be explored. The results from the analysis
of rigidities in the proposed annual budget should be assessed carefully, with a view
to developing new proposals to address rigidities in the 2009 budget. Furthermore,
shifting additional spending responsibilities for local roads to regional
governments—as recommended by the Expenditure Commission—would provide
more breathing room for the central government budget.7 To minimize fiscal risks,
this should only be extended to governments that have the capacity to undertake these
additional spending responsibilities.

28.
The recent decree creating new special tax zones (zonas francas) should be
assessed carefully. The measure widens the eligibility of firms qualifying for a much lower
income tax rate and other tax benefits. The full revenue effects of this measure are still being
assessed by the authorities. Staff recommended that this measure be administered carefully to
minimize its fiscal effects. The mission expressed its concern that the measure was at odds
with the authorities’ desire to improve the efficiency of the tax system and provide a level
playing field across activities. The authorities indicated that they remained committed to the
overall fiscal targets, and would take offsetting measures if needed.
7

The Expenditure Commission comprised a group of eminent economists in Colombia, assembled by the
government in May 2007, to examine options for reducing public expenditures.

22
Monetary and exchange rate policy
29.
Staff endorsed the tighter monetary policy stance being implemented by the
BdR. Both staff and the authorities agreed that economic developments would need to be
monitored carefully to determine whether additional tightening was needed.
30.
There may be scope to further strengthen the inflation targeting framework.
Under the present framework, each November the BdR announces a 1 percent target band for
end-December inflation for the following year. It also announces a range for the mid-point of
the target for the subsequent year.8 Staff noted that there may be advantages for Colombia to
move to an 18- or 24-month ahead target on a rolling basis. Given that the full effect of
monetary policy on inflation took longer than a year, more frequent communication on the
targeted disinflation path, beyond immediate calendar year targets, would enhance the
public’s understanding of monetary policy decisions.
31.
The authorities viewed their present system as more desirable for Colombia at
this juncture. They viewed the present framework—based on a very narrow range—as
sufficient to anchor inflation expectations. They also thought that quarterly revisions of the
targeted inflation path could lead to requests for more frequent wage negotiations. At the
same time, they agreed with staff that there were some advantages in adopting an
18–24 month target, but only after reaching the long-term inflation goal of 2–4 percent.
32.
Staff saw advantages in gradual phasing out of the marginal reserve
requirement. This measure had increased borrowing spreads and reduced the efficiency of
the financial system. The authorities agreed that the measure had undesirable effects, but
noted that its removal would need to wait until credit growth had sufficiently slowed.
33.
Staff commended the BdR’s decision to refrain from discretionary foreign
exchange intervention and allow for more exchange rate flexibility. The exchange rate
regime is classified as a managed float. The mission suggested that consideration be given to
widening the band of the automatic exchange intervention target or phasing it out
completely. The team noted that continued flexibility of the exchange rate would be an
important anchor for external stability going forward, as it would allow the external accounts
to adjust rapidly to changes in the international environment without the buildup of large
imbalances.
34.
Staff suggested that the impact of capital controls be examined carefully. The
controls are unlikely to be effective over the longer term and are at odds with the
government’s desire to deepen Colombia’s financial markets through the increased
participation of foreign capital. The staff’s preliminary assessment is that in the short run, the
controls reduced portfolio inflows and borrowing. Given the small share these comprise in
8

The mid-point for the 2009 target range is 3–3.5 percent, which implies a target range of 2½–4 percent.

23
total capital inflows, however, the effect on the exchange rate was probably modest (Box 3).
In light of their possible adverse effects on capital market development over the medium
term and limited effectiveness, staff argued that the best course of action would be to
eliminate the controls. The authorities noted that they viewed the controls as temporary,
although no timetable for their elimination could be established at the present time.
Strengthening financial stability
35.
While financial indicators remain

led to a strengthening of the financial system
during the current economic upswing. At the same time, it would be important to examine
whether the countercyclical adjustment to provisioning levels was sufficient to cover the
duration of a typical economic slowdown. The decline in liquidity ratios, associated with a
recomposition of bank assets toward lending, would also require close monitoring.
36.
There is also scope to strengthen further the assessment of risks relating to the
rapid growth of credit. Staff noted it would be useful to assess the potential risks associated
with any concentration of banks’ lending portfolios (e.g., lending to sectors that are highly
dependent on Venezuela). Consideration could also be given to strengthening the assessment
of lending standards being followed by the banks, perhaps through a high-frequency survey
of bank lending officers. Such a survey would be useful, for example, to understand how
episodes of global economic turbulence, or other shocks, affect lending behavior.

The decline in capital inflows since May has coincided with both the introduction of capital controls and
changes in other determinants of these inflows. Their introduction coincided with a steep increase in

Despite these caveats, it is likely that the controls

However, staff estimates also indicate that the capital
controls have had no statistically significant effect on
the overall level of inflows, which are mostly explained by foreign direct investment (FDI) and the net
drawdown of residents’ bank accounts abroad (Figure 2). Because debt and portfolio inflows only account for
about a fourth of total capital inflows, the impact of

Further research will be needed to provide a
comprehensive assessment of the effect of capital
controls. Further work is needed to assess the effect
of controls on banks’ derivative positions on the spot
and forward exchange rates. The role of FDI
operations and special vehicle purposes in evading
the controls also deserves further examination.
Previous research suggests that the effects of capital
controls in emerging markets are likely to be shortlived, and entail significant microeconomic costs.1

The staff welcomed the authorities’ plans to strengthen further their capacity
for risk-based supervision. The planned sequencing of reforms—to invest substantially in
training before implementing the Basel II risk-based supervisory framework—is appropriate.
The new risk-based framework is being implemented gradually, with banks now being
allowed to submit their credit risk models for commercial loans this year, while consumer
credit and mortgage-based models would be eligible for submission in 2008 and 2009,
respectively.
38.
The authorities are undertaking important reforms to develop the financial
system. The government’s proposed financial sector reform would help promote universal
banking, develop the pension system, and further liberalize the insurance sector. The staff
viewed steps to strengthen the independence of the Financial Superintendent—by providing
a fixed-term appointment—as among the most important of the proposed reforms. It
welcomed the proposal to explicitly delineate a narrow set of conditions under which the
Superintendent could be dismissed, which would be essential for ensuring independence.
Staff suggested that the fixed term might also be designed so as to overlap with the
presidential term, further increasing the autonomy of the Superintendent. Looking forward, it
would also be useful to broaden financial sector reform by including steps to strengthen
creditor rights.
39.
The government’s intention to improve the framework for the regulation and
supervision of derivatives markets is
14

Colombia maintains two exchange measures subject to Article VIII.9 An
exchange restriction and multiple currency practice arise from a tax on remittances abroad of
nonresident profits earned before 2007 and retained in the country for less than five years.
The Board has approved the retention of this restriction and multiple currency practice until

9

See Appendix I.

26
January 15, 2009. Colombia also maintains an exchange restriction arising from the special
regime for the hydrocarbons sector.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
41.
Supported by sound economic policies, Colombia’s economic performance has
been strong. The economic reforms adopted since 1999 have helped to increase private
investment, raise economic growth, and reduce inflation, while strengthening the public
finances and the financial system. Provided that sound policies are maintained, Colombia’s
medium-term prospects are favorable, with solid economic growth in the context of low
inflation, external stability, and declining public debt ratios.
42.
Rapid economic growth in 2006–07 has, however, led to overheating pressures.
The authorities have relied on monetary policy to address these pressures, with fiscal policy
being broadly neutral in 2007, following some easing the previous year. While inflation has
declined from its peak of 6¼ percent in April 2007, staff project it would close 2007 at some
5¼ percent, outside the Banco de la República’s target of 3½–4½ percent. The current
account deficit is forecast to double to 4 percent of GDP, one of the highest in the region.
43.
The near-term macroeconomic outlook is positive, although important risks
remain. As the effects of monetary tightening are fully realized, growth is expected to ease
to a more sustainable rate in 2008, contributing to a decline in inflation. The current account
deficit, however, is projected to rise to almost 5 percent of GDP, partly because of a
temporary spike in security-related imports. The uncertain global environment poses an
important risk to the outlook in the near term. There are also important domestic risks, as a
slower-than-expected response of domestic demand to monetary tightening could lead to
continued inflationary pressures.
44.
A tighter fiscal policy stance could help alleviate overheating pressures and
diminish some of these risks. The 2008 budget implies an expansionary fiscal stance in
2008, with the primary structural balance deteriorating by 1 percentage point of GDP. A
tighter fiscal stance would help reduce excess demand pressures and lower the current
account deficit, while easing the burden on monetary policy for demand management. At the
same time, it would help to reduce public debt more rapidly and build Colombia’s resilience
to shocks, and improve prospects for achieving the government’s goal of recovering
investment grade status.
45.
Colombia’s flexible exchange rate regime is consistent with the maintenance of
external stability. The recent appreciation of the peso has been driven largely by increased
confidence and stronger economic fundamentals, and the real exchange rate is close to its
equilibrium level. The rising external current account deficit has largely reflected the cyclical
position of the economy. With prudent demand management policies in place, excess
demand pressures are expected to ease and the actual current account deficit to decline
gradually toward its estimated equilibrium level of about 2½–3 percent of GDP. Going

27
forward, it would be important that the exchange rate continue to be allowed to move
flexibly to help the economy respond rapidly to changes in external conditions. Staff
welcomes the relaxation of capital controls undertaken in December, and recommends that
the authorities consider a complete phasing out of the controls in the near term, given their
limited effectiveness.
46.
Structural fiscal reforms continue to move forward. While less comprehensive
than the original government proposal, the 2006 tax reform reduced some of the system’s
distortions, while the reform of the intergovernmental transfers system will help contain the
growth of central government spending. The commercialization of ECOPETROL is expected
to further enhance Colombia’s growth prospects over the medium term. In keeping with
Colombia’s excellent track record of fiscal transparency, staff recommends that
ECOPETROL’s operations, and a measure of the CPS balance including this enterprise,
continue to be reported in budget documents. On trade reform, staff notes the importance of
ensuring that changes in the tariff structure do not result in an increase in the level or
dispersion of effective protection. Staff recommends careful administration of the recent
decree on special tax zones to minimize negative revenue effects, and fully supports the
authorities’ plans to take offsetting measures, if needed, in order to protect the fiscal targets.
47.
There is scope to deepen the agenda of fiscal reform. Staff would support the
reconsideration of earlier tax reform proposals seeking to improve the efficiency of the tax
system, notably by reducing the number of VAT rates and tax exemptions, phasing out the
financial transactions tax, and reducing payroll taxation. There is also scope to limit revenue
earmarking and other budget rigidities. Finally, staff encourages the authorities to move
forward with the privatization of ISA and ISAGEN.
48.
Efforts to strengthen the financial system are continuing. The introduction of
countercyclical provisioning in the banking system, and plans for further strengthening the
authorities’ capacity for risk-based supervision, are welcome. Steps to increase the
independence of the Financial Superintendent—by providing a fixed-term appointment—are
among the most important of the proposed financial sector reforms. Looking forward, the
reform agenda could also be broadened to include the strengthening of creditor rights.
49.
The authorities have made progress on the removal of exchange restrictions.
They have eliminated the tax on remittances of nonresident profits earned in 2007 and
beyond. Colombia maintains one unapproved exchange restriction arising from the special
regime for the hydrocarbons sector. Staff does not recommend approval of the retention of
this restriction, since there is no timetable for its removal.
50.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the 12-month
cycle.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation
(increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
4/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
5/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels of the last projection year.

B1. Nominal interest rate is at baseline plus one-half standard deviation
B2. Real GDP growth is at baseline minus one-half standard deviations
B3. Non-interest current account is at baseline minus one-half standard deviations
B4. Combination of B1-B3 using 1/4 standard deviation shocks
B5. One time 30 percent real depreciation in 2008

B. Bound Tests

APPENDIX I. BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF INFORMATIONAL ANNEXES
Discussions. The 2007 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Bogotá during
October 29–November 9, 2007. The mission met with the Minister of Finance and Public
Credit, Mr. Óscar Iván Zuluaga; the General Manager of the Banco de la República (BdR),
Mr. José Darío Uribe; the Board of Directors of the BdR; the Director of the National
Planning Department, Ms. Carolina Rentería; senior staff of several government ministries
and agencies; members of congress; and representatives of the private sector and a major
labor union. The staff team comprised B. Clements (Head), L. Abrego, E. Flores, H. Kamil
(all WHD), D. Leigh (FAD), and M. Souto (MCM). Ms. Agudelo (OED) participated in most
meetings.
Fund relations
The last Article IV consultation with Colombia was on October 30, 2006 (IMF Country
Report No. 06/408). Colombia has no outstanding credit from the Fund. An FSAP update
was carried out in September–October 2004 and the FSSA was discussed in April, 2005
(IMF Country Report No. 05/287). STA and MCM have provided technical assistance since
2005.
Exchange arrangements
Colombia has had a flexible exchange rate regime since September 1999, which is
classified as a managed float. It maintains two exchange measures subject to Fund
approval under Article VIII: (1) a multiple currency practice and an exchange
restriction arising from a tax on outward remittances of nonresident profits earned
before 2007 and that have been retained in the country for less than five years; and (2)
an exchange restriction arising from the special regime for the hydrocarbon sector.
Branches of foreign corporations are required to either surrender their export proceeds
or agree to a government limitation on their access to the foreign exchange market.
While Colombia is free under the Articles to impose surrender requirements and to
exempt the application of those requirements, conditioning such exemptions to the
acceptance of limitations on the availability of foreign exchange for the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions is inconsistent with Article
VIII, section 2 (a) of the Fund’s Articles.
Statistical issues
The quality of data in Colombia is generally adequate for surveillance. Colombia observes
the Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) and its metadata are posted on the
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB). Colombia is availing itself of a flexibility
option on the timeliness of certain production, monetary and external data. A data ROSC was
completed in September 2006 and was subsequently published as IMF Country Report
No. 06/356.

40
Relations with the World Bank Group
As of October 31, 2007, Colombia’s outstanding debt to the IBRD was US$3.9 billion. The
Bank’s portfolio consists of 18 active projects, with a total undisbursed balance of
US$0.7 billion. A new Country Partnership Strategy is being prepared and it is expected to
be approved by end-2007.

ANNEX II. COLOMBIA: WORLD BANK RELATIONS
The World Bank and Colombia’s development strategy1
Colombia’s National Development Plan is built on four pillars: (i) provide security to all
Colombians; (ii) foster sustainable economic growth and employment generation under
macroeconomic and price stability; (iii) build a more equitable society; and (iv) increase the
transparency and efficiency of the State. The World Bank Group’s (WBG’s) strategy seeks to
support Colombia’s quest for development and peace. The Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) for Colombia was discussed by the Bank’s Board in January 2003 and since then
Colombia has received about US$2 billion in loans, of which nearly 60 percent consists of
fast-disbursing operations. A CAS Progress Report was prepared in September 2005. It
follows along the same pillars of the original CAS with an additional “peace pillar” that
envisions activities to support social policies for populations affected by conflict. A new CPS
is being prepared and it is expected to be approved by the Board by the end of this calendar
year.
The World Bank program for FY 2006–07
In line with the CAS, since June 2004, the IBRD has continued the preparation of
development policy loans to support fiscal reform, financial sector reform, the labor and
social sector reform, and environmental management. Labor and social sector reforms are
being supported by a development policy loan and a technical assistance loan that aims to
improve knowledge, develop effective instruments, and strengthening ability to carry out
such reforms. The environment development policy loan is being complemented by a
technical assistance loan to support the inclusion of environmental and social policies in
government programs and to strengthen the capacity of the major relevant institutions.
The WBG’s International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) will also
support a program to increase the business productivity and efficiency, and a program in
monitoring and evaluation. The Bank’s support for the Government of Colombia’s program
for promoting greater business productivity would consist of a three-phased programmatic
development policy lending operation. The third phase extends the support to other areas of
microeconomic reform, including addressing regulatory issues in infrastructure to facilitate
private investment in the electricity and logistics sectors, key bottlenecks to firms’ expansion.
Additionally, this phase will also support second generation reforms in the financial sector to
foster the development of a universal banking structure as well as to facilitate the entry of
foreign banks to the country. The Bank will continue its support in strengthening Colombia’s
Monitoring and Evaluation system through an investment loan. The WBG’s International
Finance Corporation (IFC) focuses on supporting new forms of public-private partnerships,

(202) 473-7930 or drosenblatt@worldbank.org.

4
while the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) focuses on the provision of
political risk guarantees for private sector investments; hands-on technical assistance for
investment promotion intermediaries; and the dissemination of information on investment
opportunities in Colombia.
Bank-Fund collaboration in specific areas
The WBG is helping Colombia implement its reform agenda in the following areas of BankFund collaboration:
•

Assisting fiscal reforms, notably reforming the tax system, strengthening tax
administration, implementing a fiscal responsibility law, and reforming the public
sector.

•

Reforming the transfers from the central government to subnational governments.

•

Reforming the pension and social security systems.

•

Fostering financial sector and capital market developments.

•

Broadening and deepening the scope of Colombia’s anticorruption program.

•

Combating money laundering.

ANNEX III. COLOMBIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
The data provided by the authorities are generally adequate for surveillance. Colombia is in
observance of the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and metadata are posted on
the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB). However, Colombia is availing
itself of an SDDS flexibility option on the timeliness of the Production Index and the
Depository Corporations Survey. Colombia is also using the “as relevant” flexibility option
for the exchange rate data category. A mission visited Bogotá during September 5–16, 2005
to prepare a data ROSC, which was published in October 2006.
Real sector
The National Department of Statistics (DANE) is responsible for the compilation of the
national accounts, although the Banco de la República (BdR) compiles the financial
accounts. Estimates of GDP and expenditures are based on an outdated base year (1994). In
late 2006, the DANE completed the compilation of a new series with 2000 as the new base
year. The data comparing national accounts estimates under the old and new base years for
2000 have been posted on the DANE’s website (Boletín de Prensa, December 29, 2006).
Compilation has conformed to the recommendations of the 1993 SNA since 1995. However,
there are shortcomings in estimates of gross fixed capital formation as some agencies use
different source data and sampling techniques. Estimates of illicit activities focus on
agricultural output and do not include downstream value added.
Government finance statistics
The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MFPC) is responsible for the compilation of
public revenue, expenditure, and financing data. While significant progress has been made,
there is still a need to improve the timeliness and coverage of fiscal data, develop timely and
reliable data on the finances of local governments, and improve monitoring of floating debts.
Data cover the nonfinancial public sector (NFPS), but coverage of “above-the-line”
operations of units outside the national administration is not exhaustive due to capacity
constraints.
The General Accounting Office (GAO) has developed a single accounting database for the
public sector. The GAO accounting classification is bridged to the GFSM 2001 framework to
compile GFS on accrual and cash bases. The information is sent to the Statistics Department
of the IMF for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFS Yearbook).
Monthly data have been reported for publication in IFS and annual data for subsectors of
general government on accrual and cash bases have been reported for publication in the 2007
GFS Yearbook, with data up to 2006. Data for the consolidated general government have not
been published yet because of shortcomings in the consolidation process.

7
Financial sector statistics
The BdR is in charge of compiling data on the financial sector, while the Superintendency of
Banks and the Superintendency of Securities compile data in their respective areas. Fund
technical assistance missions have placed special emphasis on issues supportive of data
quality, including interagency cooperation and procedures to ensure data consistency. The
introduction of a new call report form in March 2005 significantly improved the quality of
monetary statistics. In mid-2007, the authorities migrated to the new standardized forms for
reporting to STA monetary data for the central bank (form 1SR) and other depository
corporations (form 2SR). Currently, they are finalizing the migration to the standardized
forms for other financial corporations (form 4SR).
Balance of payments and external debt
The BdR is in charge of compiling and disseminating balance of payments data. Quarterly
data have been produced since 1994, and the BdR adopted the BPM5 standard in 1998.
Balance of payment statistics have been extended to cover transactions in the free trade
zones. Improved surveys, particularly in the service sector, have enhanced coverage and
consistency and financial account data are now based on actual disbursement rather than
registers.
The 2005 data ROSC mission recommended that the BdR, in consultation with the DANE,
develop a methodology to include unrecorded trade in the balance of payments on a timely
basis. The BdR should reclassify FDI intercompany debt transactions from “other
investment” to FDI and some FDI equity transactions to portfolio equity, and adjust the
related investment income series accordingly. Also, it should continue efforts to identify
government bonds issued abroad and purchased by residents as well as those purchased by
residents on the secondary market.
The BdR also compiles and disseminates data on International Investment Position statistics,
External Debt statistics, and the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign
Currency Liquidity.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
COLOMBIA
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by Western Hemisphere Department
Approved by Caroline Atkinson and Michael T. Hadjimichael
January 14, 2008
1.
Colombia maintains an exchange restriction and multiple currency practice
arising from a tax on remittances abroad of nonresident profits which is withheld at the
time the foreign exchange is purchased. This measure is subject to Fund approval under
Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3. The tax has recently been eliminated for remittances of
profits earned in 2007 and beyond and applies only in respect of profits earned before 2007
and retained in the country for less than five years. On December 27, 2007 the Executive
Board, on a lapse of time basis, approved the retention of the restriction and multiple
currency practice “until January 15, 2009 or the next Article IV Consultation, whichever is
earlier.” Thus, this approval expires upon conclusion of the pending Article IV Consultation.
2.
Given that the exchange restriction and multiple currency practice are of a temporary
nature as the underlying measure will be phased out over the next four years, are maintained
for balance of payments reasons, and are nondiscriminatory in application, staff at this stage
recommends approval of their retention until April 15, 2009.

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 08/07
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 28, 2008

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
Colombia
On January 16, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Colombia.1
Background
Colombia’s economic performance in recent years has been strong, aided by sound economic
policies. The combination of wide-ranging structural reforms and prudent macroeconomic policy
management has contributed to increased private investment, higher economic growth, and
lower inflation. At the same time, both the public finances and the financial system have been
strengthened.
The rapid economic growth of recent years, however, has led to a rise in inflation and a
widening of the external current account deficit. Economic growth in 2005–06 exceeded the
Latin American average and, at close to 7 percent in 2006 and the first half of 2007, equaled its
fastest pace since the late 1970s. Growth is projected at 6¾ percent for the year as a whole.
Driven by excess demand pressures and a surge in food prices, inflation rose in 2007 and
closed the year at 5.7 percent, above the official target of 3½-4½ percent. The current account
deficit is projected to double to 4 percent of GDP in 2007, reflecting rapid import growth.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

1

2
The authorities have been tightening monetary policy, with the aim of reducing inflation. Since
April 2006, the Banco de la República has raised its policy interest rate by 350 basis points to
9½ percent. Combined with the introduction of an unremunerated reserve requirement on new
deposits in May 2007, this has led to a substantial increase in lending rates and reduced the
rate of credit growth, although the latter remains high.
The peso has appreciated over the last year, driven by strong capital inflows, especially foreign
direct investment. The nominal exchange rate vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar and the real effective rate
appreciated sharply in the first half of 2007. The authorities attempted to alleviate these
pressures through sterilized intervention in the foreign exchange market and later through
capital controls. The Banco de la República stopped intervening in May, as continued
intervention would have compromised achieving its inflation objectives. The capital controls
remain in place, however, although they were relaxed somewhat in mid-December.
Fiscal policy was broadly neutral in 2007. The combined public sector deficit is expected to
remain roughly unchanged at ¾ percentage point of GDP, with strong increases in revenues
offsetting a rise in investment expenditures. The public debt ratio is expected to fall by almost 5
percentage points of GDP to 38 percent of GDP, reflecting strong economic growth.
Aided by its flexible exchange rate regime, Colombia has weathered well the recent turbulence
in global markets. Equity prices and spreads have moved broadly in line with the rest of the
region, and there have been no disruptions to debt markets.
Colombia’s financial sector indicators remain strong. Despite rapid credit growth, credit-to-GDP
ratios are below their peak in the late 1990s and close to the emerging market average.
Liquidity has declined, but remains sufficient to cover short-term maturity mismatches.
Nonperforming loans remain a small share of total credit.
Executive Board Assessment
The Executive Directors commended the Colombian authorities for their implementation of
significant economic reforms and prudent macroeconomic policies, which, in the context of a
favorable global environment, have increased private investment, strengthened economic
growth and reduced unemployment, lowered inflation, reduced the public debt ratio, and
increased international reserves.
Directors shared the authorities’ concern that the rapid economic growth of 2006-07 has led to
overheating pressures, with inflation exceeding the 2007 end-year target and the external
current account deficit rising. Key policy challenges facing the authorities are to achieve
sustainable economic growth with price stability through an appropriate macroeconomic policy
mix, while further enhancing productivity through the ongoing structural reforms. In this context,
Directors endorsed the authorities’ tightening of the monetary policy stance, and welcomed the
strengthening of the fiscal position and the authorities’ commitment to long-term fiscal
sustainability. Given the prospect of an expansionary fiscal stance in 2008, many Directors
urged the authorities to stand ready to tighten fiscal policy to help reduce excess demand

3
pressures. Some Directors considered that further fiscal steps should await an assessment of
the impact on domestic demand of the recent monetary policy tightening.
Directors noted that the current inflation targeting framework has served Colombia well, and
generally agreed that it would be premature at this juncture to adapt the framework by moving
to a longer-term inflation target on a rolling basis. They agreed that the flexible exchange rate
regime is consistent with external stability. They noted that the value of the peso remains
consistent with fundamentals, with the recent real appreciation of the peso being driven largely
by increased confidence and stronger economic fundamentals. Most Directors stressed that
continued flexibility of the exchange rate is important to underpin the inflation targeting
framework and allow the economy to respond rapidly to changes in external conditions, while
some Directors saw merit in the automatic intervention rule aimed at controlling exchange rate
volatility. They viewed the rising current account deficit as reflecting the cyclical phase of the
economy. Directors welcomed the relaxation of capital controls in late 2007, and endorsed the
authorities’ view that capital controls are ineffective in the long run. A number of Directors
emphasized the importance of phasing out capital controls, while some others supported them
as a short-term measure.
Directors welcomed the continued progress on structural fiscal reform, including tax reform,
intergovernmental transfers, and the commercialization of the state oil company. Many Directors
saw merit in continued reporting on the state oil company’s operations in budget documents,
and a few Directors suggested that the authorities also publish a measure of the fiscal balance
that includes this enterprise. Directors urged careful administration of the recent decree on
special tax zones to minimize negative revenue effects. They also encouraged the authorities to
deepen the agenda of fiscal reform. On the revenue side, Directors emphasized the importance
of a comprehensive tax reform, including a reduction of the number of value added tax rates
and tax exemptions, and encouraged the authorities to build the necessary political support for
such a reform. On the expenditure side, there is scope for steps to reduce revenue earmarking
and other budget rigidities. Some Directors encouraged the authorities to move forward with the
privatization of two national electricity companies.
Directors welcomed the finding that the banking sector remains well capitalized, with a low level
of non-performing loans and a high level of loan loss provisioning. They urged continued
vigilance in view of the increase in nonperforming loans for consumer credit. In this regard, they
commended the ongoing efforts to further strengthen the financial system, including the
introduction of counter-cyclical provisioning in the banking system, reinforcement of risk-based
supervision, improvement of the regulatory framework for the supervision of derivatives
markets, and further liberalization of the insurance sector. They also emphasized the
importance of increasing the independence of the Financial Superintendent.
A few Directors encouraged the authorities to remove the exchange restriction arising from the
special regime for the hydrocarbons sector.
