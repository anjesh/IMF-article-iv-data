IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with the Dominican
Republic
On February 19, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Dominican Republic, and considered and
endorsed the staff appraisal without a meeting on a lapse-of-time basis.1
Background
The Dominican economy has continued its vibrant performance. Growth averaged over 7
percent during 2014–15, fueled mainly by domestic demand. Employment recovery and the
decline in oil prices boosted disposable income, while the consumption-led recovery in the
U.S provided tailwinds through linkages with tourism and remittance flows. Strong growth in
private investment dovetailed the expansion in consumption.
Despite strong growth, lower oil prices kept inflation low and strengthened the external
position. While inflation expectations remained within the central bank’s target of 4±1
percent, actual inflation was below the target range throughout 2015, picking up to over 2
percent by end-year as the oil price effect waned and food prices spiked following a mid-year
drought. The external position strengthened on the back of lower oil prices and robust
remittance and tourism inflows. The current account deficit is estimated at about 2 percent of
GDP by end-2015 and reserves recovered to a level equivalent to over three and a half
months of imports, excluding free-trade zones. The current account deficit and the real
exchange rate are broadly in line with the economy’s fundamentals.
The monetary policy stance remained broadly neutral during 2015. Softening core inflation
prompted several rounds of interest rate cuts by the central bank in early 2015, to 5 percent,
which offset an earlier policy tightening. The banking system continues to show healthy
capitalization, profitability and asset quality.
The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse-of-time procedure when the Board
agrees that a proposal can be considered without convening formal discussions.

Fiscal policies continued to safeguard the gains from the recent fiscal consolidation. The
fiscal adjustment during 2013–14, to a consolidated public sector deficit of about 4.5 percent
of GDP, has been critical in restoring confidence. Excluding one-off receipts, the deficit in
2015 is estimated to have been maintained at broadly similar levels as the previous year.
This, together with the face value reduction in public debt (by 3.1 percent of GDP) due to the
restructuring of the Petrocaribe liabilities, moderated the increase in consolidated public
sector debt (including the debt of the electricity sector and the central bank) to 48.5 percent
of GDP estimated by staff for 2015.
Going forward, the growth momentum will soften as the economy returns to its potential
growth. Staff projects growth to slow to 5.4 percent in 2016 and to its longer-term potential
rate of 4.5–5 percent by 2017. The positive output gap and the incipient pressures on real
wages are projected to return inflation to the target range in 2016. Risks to the staff’s
macroeconomic outlook are moderate and somewhat tilted to the downside, largely owing to
potential negative spillovers from weaker growth in advanced economies.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2015 Article IV consultation with Dominican Republic, Executive
Directors endorsed the staff’s appraisal as follows:
Economic activity maintains a strong momentum, aided by a favorable external environment
and a strengthened policy framework. Domestic demand has been the main growth engine,
supported by an expansion in employment, robust credit growth, lower oil prices, and the
recovery in the U.S. Inflation remained low, the current account deficit contracted, and key
social indicators improved. The implementation of sound policies has underpinned the strong
economic performance. The inflation targeting framework has been successful at maintaining
inflation expectations around the official target range in the face of positive supply shocks,
and notable fiscal consolidation efforts over the past three years have slowed further
increases in public debt. Going forward, as some of the external tailwinds dissipate, the
economy is expected to slow to its potential growth of 4.5–5 percent. The challenge for
macroeconomic policies will be to sustain high growth rates and address remaining poverty
and inequality challenges, further strengthening the fiscal position, limiting risks of negative
international spillovers and tackling long-term legacies in the electricity sector.
Fiscal sustainability and social spending pressures require renewed attention to strengthening
the fiscal position. Over the medium-term, public debt is set to rise due to large consolidated
deficits, and additional pressures are building from the need to sustain adequate infrastructure
and social spending. The authorities’ continued commitment to fiscal discipline is welcome,
and the favorable cyclical position provides a good opportunity to undertake the adjustment
to put debt on a downward path. A major effort is needed to expand the narrow tax base,
eroded by tax exemptions and incentives, and to tackle inefficient spending, including on
generalized electricity subsidies. The strides achieved over the past decade in building up
institutions are notable, but there is merit in further strengthening the fiscal framework by

3

anchoring annual policy decision-making to sustainability objectives and improving the
quality of spending. The risk profile of public debt would benefit from reduced reliance on
foreign currency borrowing, which necessitates further development of the domestic bond
market in coordination with the central bank, a major issuer in the market.
The monetary policy stance is appropriate in guiding inflation back to target range, but a
strengthened framework could further improve policy effectiveness and outcomes. The
strong economic outlook, waning supply shocks, and tightening labor markets are reducing
the scope for further interest rate cuts. The tightening bias is therefore appropriate in
guarding against upside risks to inflation. Transition towards more exchange rate flexibility
and the continued buildup of reserves will increase resilience against external spillovers and
shocks. The challenges of managing monetary policy and legacy quasi-fiscal debts should be
tackled through increased coordination with the fiscal authorities in avoiding overlap
between two issuers to develop the local bond markets and in firming up the recapitalization
arrangements.
The resilience of the financial system has been strengthened over the past years in tandem
with improved bank supervision. The regulatory reform agenda for the banking system needs
to be further advanced towards best international practice, and pockets of rapid credit growth
warrant monitoring. At the same time, the supervision of non-bank financial intermediaries
remains weak and―although these are not systemic―vigilance is needed against inherent
risks, especially those related to potential AML/CFT activities.
Sustaining strong economic growth and making it more inclusive will require concerted
reform efforts. The authorities’ reforms in education, strengthening social safety nets, and in
promoting financial inclusion should help boost growth and improve social outcomes.
Addressing long-standing problems in the electricity sector remains key to improving growth
prospects. Needed measures include significant upgrades to the public distribution networks,
a move towards cost recovery pricing and reducing regulatory uncertainty. The latter would
also foster a stronger investment climate needed to narrow infrastructure gaps, while
increased product market competition and labor market flexibility would strengthen the
economy’s competitiveness.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
February 2, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context. The Dominican Republic remains among the most dynamic economies in
the region, benefiting from a strengthened macro-policy framework and external
tailwinds. It does not face significant internal or external imbalances: inflation is low,
fiscal deficits and debt moderate, and the external position is broadly in line with
fundamentals. Vulnerabilities remain, however: public debt is set to increase over the
medium-term and the tax ratio is one of the lowest in the world, reserves are below
the Fund’s suggested metric, legacy bottlenecks in the electricity sector remain
unresolved, and social challenges persist. The consultations focused on policies to
address these vulnerabilities and strengthen the economy’s resilience to external
shocks.
Main policy issues.


Fiscal policy and framework. Given the favorable cyclical conditions, fiscal
consolidation should accelerate to halt the upward debt dynamics and open fiscal
space for needed infrastructure and social spending. Widening the narrow tax
base by tackling tax exemptions and incentives will be critical in supporting the
adjustment. There is merit in further strengthening the fiscal framework by
anchoring annual policy decision-making to sustainability objectives.



Monetary policy and framework. The broadly neutral monetary policy stance is
appropriate, and the tightening bias will help guard against increasing upside
risks to inflation. Transition towards more exchange rate flexibility as the market
infrastructure is strengthened will help build reserve buffers, absorb external
shocks, and improve the credibility of the regime. Coordination between
monetary and fiscal authorities is needed to foster the development of the local
bond market and to firm the central bank’s recapitalization arrangements.



Financial system. Against the backdrop of a strong banking system and bank
supervision, the supervision of nonbank intermediaries requires concerted
attention to mitigate financial and AML/CFT compliance risks.



Structural reforms. Addressing legacy problems in the electricity sector― through
distribution grid upgrades, cost recovery pricing, and reduced regulatory
uncertainty―remains key to sustaining high growth. Reforms to foster a stronger
investment climate and address labor and product markets rigidities would help
narrow infrastructure gaps and strengthen competitiveness. Sustaining ongoing
reform efforts in education and financial inclusion will support a further
improvement in social outcomes and potential growth.

Overview. The Dominican Republic remains among the most dynamic economies in the
region, having benefitted from a strengthened policy framework and external tailwinds. Growth
averaged 5⅓ percent over the past two decades and 6 percent over the past two years, notably
above the average for Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). After the severe banking crisis in
2003–04, policies have been strengthened with a cleanup of the financial system and reinforced
supervision, the introduction of inflation targeting in 2012, and a commitment to fiscal
responsibility. At present, the economy does

The growth momentum remains strong, but the pace of expansion is set to gradually
slow to potential. Growth accelerated to 7.3 percent in 2014 and remained at a robust 7 percent in
2015 according to preliminary data, propelled largely by domestic demand.2 Employment recovery
and the decline in oil prices boosted disposable income, while the consumption-led recovery in the
U.S provided tailwinds through linkages from tourism and higher remittances. Strong growth in
private investment, supported by robust credit and external inflows, dovetailed the expansion in

Despite strong growth, inflationary pressures remained subdued. Lower fuel prices
pulled headline inflation to an average of 0.8 percent during 2015, below the central bank’s target of
4±1 percent. Second-round effects have also dampened core inflation, prompting several rounds of
interest rate cuts by the central bank in early 2015. As oil prices begin to stabilize, the positive
output gap, recent spikes in food prices following a severe mid-2015 drought, and the incipient
pressures on real wages are beginning to add upward price pressures.3 As a result, inflation picked
up to 2⅓ percent by end-2015, and both staff and the authorities project it to return to the target
range in 2016. The incidence of recent price developments has been regressive, as the highest
income quintile faced a slight deflation in the year to November and prices for the lowest income
quintile increased by over 4 percent.4

2

Since the last Article IV consultations, the national accounts have been rebased from 1991 to 2007. Under the
revised accounts, released in August 2014, real growth averaged 0.4 percentage points lower and nominal growth
about 0.1 percentage points higher over the period 1991-2013. The revision affected the ratios to GDP, with the
public debt ratio for 2014 about 0.5 percentage points lower post-revision.
3
Real wages in the private sector have remained stagnant over the past five years, declining after the crisis and
beginning to recover more meaningfully following the mid-2015 round of biennial minimum wage negotiations. With
labor productivity outpacing real wage growth since the crisis, the economy’s competitiveness has strengthened.
4

The regressivity has been driven by the fact that (i) fuel constitutes a larger share of the consumption basket for
high-income earners, and its price has dropped significantly, while (ii) food and beverages constitute a larger share of
low-income earners’ consumption basket, and their prices have increased over the same period.

The monetary policy stance remained broadly neutral during 2015, while financial
conditions tightened. Faced with declining inflation, the central bank reduced policy rates in three
consecutive moves from 6¼ to 5 percent during March–May 2015. These reductions offset the
earlier policy tightening through increased reserve requirements, keeping the monetary stance
broadly neutral during 2015.5 Financial conditions tightened, however, as falling inflation increased
real interest rates and the peso appreciated in real effective terms.

Fiscal consolidation over the past three years helped reduce macroeconomic
imbalances. The widening of the consolidated public sector deficit in 2012 to 7¾ percent of GDP,
while boosting needed infrastructure investment, created significant uncertainty about the direction
of fiscal policies and worsened the current account deficit.6 The subsequent adjustment during
2013–14―to a deficit of 4½ percent of GDP― has been critical in restoring confidence. Preliminary
estimates suggest that the underlying fiscal deficit remained at broadly similar levels in 2015 despite

the loss of one-off and gold-related revenues,
largely due to careful prioritization of spending on
goods, services, and transfers.7 The headline fiscal
deficit in 2015, on the other hand, reports a
significant fiscal consolidation owing to the capital
grant from the restructuring of the Petrocaribe
debt (3.1 percent of GDP; Box 1). Despite the
restructuring operation, the consolidated public

Box 1. Restructuring of the Petrocaribe Debt
In January 2015, the Dominican Republic restructured its debt with Venezuela’s state-owned oil company
PDVSA under the Petrocaribe agreement. It bought back US$4 billion of its debt with PDVSA at a discount of
about 52 percent. The operation was financed with a sovereign bond placement of US$2.5 billion of 10-year
and 30-year maturities, of which US$1.9 billion was used to buy

7.
The fiscal adjustment has been supported by wide-ranging fiscal structural reforms.
Tax administration efforts focused on the fight against tax fraud and evasion, risk management and
coordination between collection agencies. In public financial management, reforms covered the
transparency of public accounts, extending their coverage to other decentralized entities and their
inclusion in the treasury single account. 8 Public debt management has also helped mitigate risks,
especially through notable maturity extension.

The underlying deficit is the headline fiscal deficit net of one-off tax receipts, capital grants and tax amnesty
collections.

Budget Index score between 2012 and 2015.

8.
The external position strengthened with lower oil prices and a favorable external
environment. Preliminary estimates suggest that the current account deficit narrowed to 2 percent
in 2015, the lowest in a decade and a half, due to the sharp fall in oil prices, buoyant tourism
receipts and remittances, and the expansion of
gold exports. Reserve coverage increased to
3⅔ months of imports (excluding free-trade
zones) by end-2015. However, the net
international investment position has continued
to deteriorate, primarily due to FDI inflows and
to a lesser extent public borrowing. Over the
medium term, the current account deficit is
projected to widen gradually to some 3 percent
of GDP as oil prices recover and interest
payments on external public debt rise.
9.
The banking system continues to show healthy capitalization, profitability, and asset
quality. The system-wide capital adequacy is well above regulatory requirements, at about
15 percent as of September 2015. The rapid increase in private credit over the past year was driven
mainly by a pickup in credit from the public bank―as part of its strategy to diversify away from
public sector lending and as it pre-financed projects in the electricity sector―and has therefore not
translated into pressures on non-performing loans. The latter declined to 1.5 percent of the banking
system’s loan portfolio by September 2015 and have a healthy provisioning coverage, while
profitability and liquidity in the system remain strong. In November 2014, an insolvent non-systemic
bank (Peravia, 0.2 percent of bank assets) was intervened and is being wound down.
10.
The financial position of state-owned Banreservas, which accounts for a third of the
market, also improved. Following its 2013 restructuring plan, the profitability of the bank
strengthened, non-performing loans remained far below the level of recent years, and the capital
was increased at end-2014. The bank’s capitalization is broadly in line with the private banking
system, but capital adequacy is lower once the concentration of zero-weighted lending to the
government is accounted for.

Social outcomes have improved along with the economy’s performance, but pressing
social needs persist. Strong economic growth and targeted social spending over the last three
years helped reduce unemployment to about 6 percent by end-2015, the share of households living
in poverty by a fifth (to about 35 percent of the population), and the share of those living in extreme
poverty by a third (to about 7 percent). However, poverty remains among the highest in LAC. Labor
income inequality―measured by the relative dispersion between the upper and lower deciles of the
wage distribution―remained broadly unchanged over the past decade, resulting in a widening gap
between the high and low-income earners.

12.
Risks to the outlook are moderate and somewhat tilted to the downside (Annex I). On
the downside:


Weaker growth in advanced and emerging economies may dampen the outlook through trade
channels, FDI, tourism receipts, and remittances. Spillovers from a slowdown in the U.S. would
be particularly detrimental given close integration.



Geopolitical developments in the region present some downside risks, but these are likely to be
low-impact or materialize in the long-term. The recent policy to regularize illegal immigrants to
the Dominican Republic and the subsequent ban on overland exports of a number of Dominican
products to Haiti (the country’s second largest importer) has generated tensions that could
affect exports and labor markets, although it is early to quantify these. The reopening of the
U.S.-Cuba diplomatic relations could pose risks of potential diversion of tourism, exports, and
FDI inflows, although its effect is likely to be protracted. Finally, the possible discontinuation of
the Petrocaribe agreement with Venezuela may result in less favorable fiscal and external
financing terms, although the effect is likely to be negligible (Annex II).



Other downside risks include tighter or more volatile global financial conditions, which may
increase financing costs, dampen demand, and put some pressure on the exchange rate. Given
relatively weak financial integration of the Dominican Republic with the world financial markets,
the effect of this risk is estimated to be moderate, unless accompanied by a slowdown in the
U.S.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

On the upside, a greater boost to demand may come from persistently lower-than-anticipated oil
prices or a faster recovery of the U.S. economy.

SECURING DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
13.
The authorities have signaled their intention to continue the fiscal consolidation, but
plans are likely to be firmed up after the 2016 presidential elections. The 2016 budget targets a
mild narrowing in the central government deficit (by ½ percent of GDP) over the next three years,
with measures remaining to be identified. This adjustment will be insufficient to prevent an upward
creep in the consolidated public debt, given the anticipated pressures on the fiscal position. Staff’s
baseline scenario suggests that―in the absence of policy measures and with the increase in debt
servicing costs following monetary policy normalization in the U.S.―the consolidated public sector
deficit would hover around 5 percent of GDP over the medium term, pushing the debt ratio from
48½ percent estimated for 2015 to about 53 percent by 2020.9 Although risks to this baseline fiscal
outlook are largely tilted towards better-than-projected outcomes under plausible macroeconomic
shocks (Annex IV), these are partly offset by downside risks from larger spending needs in the
electricity sector, contingent exposures in the banking sector, and public sector’s exposure to
exchange-rate risk (Annex VI).

Future consolidation efforts should be underpinned by both tax reforms and
expenditure rationalization.

In the near term, the weakening of the fiscal position will also be driven by the ongoing construction of two coal
plants (Box 2).

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DOMINICAN REPUBLIC



The tax base remains very narrow for the country’s level of income due to numerous exemptions
and tax incentives. The tax ratio was about 14 percent of GDP in 2014 (excluding one-off
revenues), one of the lowest in the world, while tax expenditures accounted for 6½ percent of
GDP. The widening of the tax base should therefore be a policy priority, with revenue
mobilization efforts focusing on substantively eliminating VAT and excise exemptions,
rationalizing tax incentives, and boosting
personal income tax collections through
lowering the tax threshold. 10 These
measures would not only open fiscal space
for needed infrastructure and social
spending, but would also make the tax
system more equitable, less distortive, and
easier to administer. Efforts should focus
initially on eliminating exemptions for
upper-income taxpayers, while maintaining
exemptions aimed at protecting socially
vulnerable groups.



The need to expand the fiscal envelope, while undertaking the fiscal consolidation, will require
further expenditure rationalization. This would need to focus on reducing subsidies to the
electricity sector, rationalizing spending on inefficient public institutions, and improving quality
of spending. In particular, subsidies to the electricity sector averaged 2–2½ percent of GDP in
recent years, which now fell to 1½ percent in 2015 due to lower oil prices. Adjusting tariffs to
cost recovery levels (at least 11 percent higher than current tariffs, according to existing
methodologies) or, as a first stage, allowing automatic tariff adjustment going forward to lock in
recent savings is critical; social safety nets should be strengthened at the same time to mitigate
the effects on the most vulnerable.

16.
A credible medium-term fiscal framework would be important to further strengthen
fiscal institutions. The upcoming discussions of the fiscal pact―required by the national
development strategy―would provide an opportunity to strengthen the fiscal policy framework
going forward, including potentially through transition to a rule-based framework. The latter could
provide a medium-term fiscal policy anchor to facilitate the improvement in the fiscal position and
strengthen credibility of fiscal policies, but would have to rely on simple rules that allow for flexibility
to absorb cyclical fluctuations.
17.
Authorities’ views. The authorities reiterated their commitment to fiscal discipline,
demonstrated by the considerable fiscal consolidation undertaken since 2012, especially in the
context of the mandated doubling of spending on education. They noted that the fiscal pact―
deferred to the next administration given the proximity of the elections and the still ongoing

11

DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

discussions of the electricity pact (Box 2)―will be an important component of the government’s
medium-term fiscal strategy and plans to reduce public debt over time. The authorities also noted
the need to increase revenue to address challenges related to debt sustainability and a narrow fiscal
envelope. They pointed that the electricity sector and the quasi-fiscal deficit of the central bank
continue to be important drivers of consolidated public sector debt dynamics. In this regard, they
emphasized the importance of resolving the challenges in the electricity sector and strengthening
the arrangements for central bank recapitalization and management of the quasi-fiscal deficit.
Cognizant of past election-related pressures, the authorities affirmed their commitment to fiscal
discipline and to the targets set out in the 2016 budget.

MONETARY POLICY AND FRAMEWORK
18.
The neutral monetary policy stance is currently appropriate, and policies should
remain vigilant to guard against the risks of higher inflation. With inflation expected to return
to the target by end-2016, staff and the authorities agreed that the current neutral stance is
warranted. At the same time, the widening positive output gap, the tightening labor markets, and
the possible depreciation pressures related to the beginning of the normalization cycle in the U.S.
merit vigilance against the risks of higher-than-expected inflation going forward. Staff therefore
welcomed the tightening bias adopted by the central bank and its readiness to tighten monetary
policy if signs of stronger-than-anticipated inflationary pressures emerge.
19.
Further strengthening the monetary policy framework will help improve
macroeconomic outcomes.


Exchange rate. Staff noted that allowing greater exchange rate flexibility would strengthen the
credibility of the inflation targeting regime, increase the economy’s ability to absorb external
shocks and, at the current juncture, help achieve the inflation objectives and build up reserves.
The authorities indicated their intention to upgrade the infrastructure of the foreign exchange
market by introducing an electronic trading platform in 2016, and to develop foreign exchange
hedging instruments to support a gradual move towards more exchange rate flexibility.11 A rulebased foreign exchange intervention mechanism will also be considered to foster changes in
exchange rate expectations while guarding against excessive volatility. The interventions could
be based on gradually widening the tolerance thresholds, with an asymmetric band that allows
more intervention to accumulate reserves.



Monetary policy and quasi-fiscal deficits.12 With a large stock of legacy bank recapitalization
bonds (around 10 percent of GDP) still managed by the central bank along with domestic
liquidity, a number of challenges remain to be addressed. Under the current setting of
recapitalization of the central bank, a stronger coordination between fiscal and monetary

20.
Authorities’ views. The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment and reiterated
their commitment to price stability and strengthening of the inflation targeting framework. They
indicated that they are closely monitoring both external and domestic developments, and adopting
a neutral-to-tight monetary policy bias. They noted that while moving towards a more flexible
exchange rate regime has advantages, current efforts are focus on first strengthening the market
infrastructure to manage exchange rate fluctuations, especially in the context of fairly dollarized
balance sheets. Both the central bank and the fiscal authorities recognized that current
arrangements to recapitalize the central bank are not effective and indicated that they are analyzing
alternatives to strengthen it. The issues that will be considered are the consistency of the transfer
size with the fiscal envelope, the speed of the recapitalization, and accountability for managing fiscal
resources.

STRENGTHENING RESILIENCE TO EXTERNAL SHOCKS

current account and the predicted value narrows significantly, indicating no major misalignment.
Direct estimates of the equilibrium real exchange rate are broadly consistent with this assessment,
suggesting only a marginally weaker currency than that consistent with fundamentals and desired
policies. Over the medium term, while the current account deficit is expected to widen, it will remain
consistent with a level that stabilizes the net foreign assets position (see Annex III).
22.
The narrowing of the external current account deficit provides a good opportunity to
strengthen the reserve buffers. Reserves have risen significantly since the 2003–04 financial crisis,
and are deemed broadly sufficient against a number of standard reserve adequacy benchmarks,
including short-term debt and import coverage ratios (see Annex III). However, despite recent
improvements in the current account, continued foreign exchange interventions prevented faster
accumulation of reserves, which remain notably
below the Fund’s risk-based reserve metric. The
latter requires coverage not only for short-term,
but also longer-term liabilities, and current
reserves only cover about 60 percent of the
implied adequacy level. At the same time, the
dominant share of public debt in long-term
external liabilities (with about half of it owed to
official creditors and a protracted schedule of
amortization) and the relatively diverse sources
of foreign exchange inflows mitigate the need
for such high reserves.
23.
Authorities’ views. The authorities broadly concurred with staff’s external sector
assessment and reiterated their commitment to continue accumulating reserves and enhance
resilience to shocks. Moreover, the authorities recognized that further reserve accumulation is
needed, but also emphasized that reserve levels have steadily increased since the banking crisis in
2003 and that a faster pace of accumulation is constrained by high sterilization costs.

REFORMS FOR SUSTAINABLE AND MORE INCLUSIVE
GROWTH
24.
A faster improvement in living standards will require sustaining high growth and
making it more inclusive. While robust economic performance in recent years has allowed some
catch-up of per capita income relative to other LAC economies, it still remains at 25 percent of the
U.S. levels and 85 percent of the average LAC levels, in PPP terms. Potential growth, estimated at
4½–5 percent, may of itself not be sufficient to ensure a fast convergence to higher per capita
income and substantially reduce poverty.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

25.
Despite notable improvements in cost and structural competitiveness, there are a
number of areas where reforms could boost the economy’s potential. The electricity sector
remains the main bottleneck for growth, but the Dominican Republic also lags behind its regional
peers in the quality of infrastructure and institutions, education and health outcomes, and resolving
insolvency (Figure 5).


Electricity sector. Long-standing challenges in the electricity sector absorb substantial fiscal
resources and pose significant obstacles to economic development (Box 2). Recent policy action
focused on enhancing generation capacity and reducing generation costs through the
construction of two coal power plants that are expected to come on stream in 2017. The
authorities also took actions to clear
most of the arrears with the generators,
reflecting efforts to strengthen financial
discipline. Ongoing discussions of the
Electricity Pact among the social partners
are expected to generate a
comprehensive package of measures to:
(i) reduce electricity losses, especially
through investments in the distribution
network; (ii) gradually adjust tariffs to
cost recovery; and (iii) ensure a stable
and predictable regulatory framework to
facilitate private energy investments.



Infrastructure gaps. Despite robust investment over the past few years, poor infrastructure
continues to constrain the economy’s growth potential (Figure 5). Investment needs in the
electricity sector alone are estimated at an additional ⅓–½ percent of GDP per year over the
medium term. Despite consolidation needs, spending on infrastructure needs to be sustained at
adequate levels to ensure continued increases in the country’s capital stock, through revenue
reform and expenditure prioritization.



Institutional strength and governance. Institutional quality and governance have long trailed the
country’s regional peers (Figure 5). Meaningful advances were made over the past decade, but
continued efforts are essential to strengthen governance, enhance the culture of institutionalism,
and improve the rule of law.



Bankruptcy reform. An obsolete insolvency framework had limited investment opportunities and
discouraged business activity. The recently adopted Bankruptcy Law aims at addressing
identified deficiencies in terms of defining a business restructuring framework, reducing time
and costs associated with bankruptcy procedures, as well as improving recovery rates.



Product and labor markets. Rigid severance pay regulation and high transportation costs, largely
as a result of strong unionization in the sector, push up the cost structures throughout the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

economy. Addressing these rigidities in the labor and product markets would support a stronger
competitive environment.
Box 2. Electricity Sector: Issues and Reforms
The electricity sector remains a major fiscal drag and a key bottleneck for the economy.
Notwithstanding recent improvements, distribution losses in the electricity sector remain among the highest
in the region and tariffs fall short of costs. A confluence of factors has contributed to this, including
insufficient investments in the distribution grid, governance weaknesses at state-owned distribution
companies, high share of unbilled energy (about half of clients are not metered), as well as a relatively
unfavorable energy matrix, with about half of
total electricity generated using fuel oil. This has
given rise to annual deficits of 2–2½ percent of
GDP in the public electricity distribution and
transmission sector (down to 1½ percent in
2015 due to lower oil prices), which are covered
with fiscal transfers or accumulation of arrears to
private electricity generators. At the same time,
unstable electricity supply and common
blackouts adversely affect economic activity,
disrupt production processes, and generate
additional costs for companies, as many of them
had to install their own electricity generators.
New power plants. The public electricity holding company started construction of two new coal plants,
estimated to cost about US$2 billion (3 percent of GDP) and expected to enter into operation in 2017. Their
completion is projected to increase the share of coal in the electricity generation matrix by about 11 percent,
mainly by reducing the share of fuel oil. While the recent collapse in world oil prices would substantially
reduce the savings expected earlier, savings would still remain under the current commodity price outlook
and the diversified energy matrix will provide protection against future volatility of oil prices.
Electricity Pact. In line with the National Development Strategy 2030, a comprehensive social consultation
process was started in 2015 (with participation from various government institutions, energy companies, civil
society organizations, and experts) on a National Pact to Reform the Electricity Sector. The pact is expected
to entail a broad consensus for actions to address the decades-old challenges in the electricity sector. The
authorities expect the pact to be concluded in early-2016.

26.
The government’s policy agenda prioritizes social inclusion and poverty alleviation,
but additional fiscal space is needed to safeguard this spending.


16

Education. Reforms in education have been underpinned by a National Education Reform Pact,
agreed between the government and the civil society in April 2014. Spending on pre-university
education roughly doubled as a result, to 4 percent of GDP, in support of large-scale programs
to build new schools, extend teaching hours (from 4 to 8) and improve learning outcomes,
where the Dominican Republic has traditionally lagged behind regional peers. Beyond improving
the productive capacity through higher human capital, the reforms may provide a boost to labor
participation as more female workers substitute reduced household duties with formal
employment.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DOMINICAN REPUBLIC



Social safety nets were also strengthened with better-targeted, categorized, and coordinated
social assistance programs for the most vulnerable. While the authorities have taken steps to
extend basic health coverage to improve inclusion of socially-vulnerable categories, a major area
remaining to be addressed includes access to health and social security insurance by the
informal sector (including self-employed), which accounts for about half of the labor force.



Financial inclusion. Gaps in financial inclusion remain particularly acute at the household level
due to inadequate number of bank accounts in lower income segments, and low usage of debit
cards and ATMs. The authorities launched a number of programs aimed at addressing financial
inclusion and promoting financial education: (i) the institution of “bank agents” (currently about
2–3 thousand commercial entities that are allowed to provide limited services on behalf of
financial institutions) has opened access to financial services for most vulnerable groups; (ii) the
administration of social benefits through payment cards is also promoting financial inclusion;
and (iii) several programs have been directed at the financial education of the public and the
press.

27.
Authorities’ views. The authorities largely concurred with staff’s view on the economy’s
potential and the need to continue structural reforms. While strong foreign direct investment flows
continue to attest to a favorable business environment, they reiterated their commitment to
continue actions aimed at strengthening competitiveness. They noted in particular the setup of the
joint private-public Competitiveness Roundtable in May 2014, aimed at identifying policy measures
to improve competitiveness and strengthen the overall business environment. The authorities largely
agreed that key challenges remain in the electricity sector, and pointed out that the Electricity Pact
will aim to address them. The authorities also emphasized that reducing poverty and making growth
more inclusive continues to be one of the key socio-economic challenges and remains very high on
their policy agenda.

SAFEGUARDING FINANCIAL STABILITY AND
PROMOTING FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT
28.
Staff welcomed the strengthening of the financial system and its supervision, but
noted that pockets of vulnerability remain. The authorities have strengthened the bank
supervisory and regulatory framework, including through continued work towards implementation
of Basel core principles, risk-based supervision, thematic reviews of bank risks, and institutional
reforms; efforts to further advance progress in these areas continue. Staff noted that while the
financial position of banks is strong, pockets of rapid credit growth, especially in foreign currency,
merit close monitoring. In addition, the regulation and supervision of nonbank intermediaries, in
particular credit unions, is weak. Although the system is very small according to available data, it is
closely interlinked with banks through ownership channels and some institutions are as large as
banks. The financial system has remained largely unaffected by the withdrawal of certain financial
services by global banks (“de-risking”), with only smaller financial services institutions impacted.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

29.
Weaknesses in nonbank supervision could also create challenges for compliance with
anti-money laundering (AML)/combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) standards. Since the
previous assessment by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in 2006, the authorities have taken
steps to strengthen the AML/CFT framework and supervision, and are working to address
weaknesses in the supervision of nonbank intermediaries. These efforts will need to be supported by
bringing the AML/CFT supervisory framework in line with the 2012 FATF standard, notably with
respect to nonbank supervision, and by strengthening the financial intelligence unit.13

Authorities’ views. The authorities reiterated their commitment to safeguarding the
soundness of financial system. They stated that the intensive supervision program resulted in
improved bank capitalization, and that they are closely monitoring the quality of the loan portfolio
and provisioning levels in the context of robust credit growth. They also stressed their commitment
to further strengthen Banreservas and increase the paid-in capital by capitalizing future profits. The
authorities pointed that—despite rapid foreign currency credit growth in some sectors—foreign
currency loans can only be extended to borrowers with foreign currency earnings, minimizing credit
risk. The authorities indicated that they are considering plans to address deficiencies in AML/CFT
compliance by nonbanks and other private sector activities in the real sector.

Box 3. Financial System and its Development since the 2003 Crisis
The financial system in the Dominican Republic is small, dominated by banks and highly concentrated.
Financial system assets account for about 55 percent of GDP, one of the smallest in the region. The system is
dominated by commercial banks, but these are part of financial groups that usually include pension funds,
securities brokers and insurance companies.

Commercial banks. The banking system is very concentrated, with some 78 percent of total assets in three banks
and a third in the state-owned Banreservas. The presence of foreign banks increased since 2008, with now 7 out of
17 banks being foreign-owned. Still, their share remained relatively low, at 10 percent of total banking system.
Other deposit taking institutions are relatively small, representing 10 percent of total financial system. They
include saving banks, saving and loan associations and credit cooperatives.
The pension funds represent the fastest growing segment of the financial market, and are becoming an important
institutional investor. The pension system was reformed in 2003 with the introduction of mandatory savings. Since
then, contributions to the funds have gradually increased, and the funds mostly invest in public debt securities.
Investment in corporate bonds is only 5 percent of the pension funds’ portfolio. Current regulations do not allow
pension funds to invest abroad.
Insurance sector remains small and concentrated. The system represents only 2 percent of total financial system,
with the largest five companies (out of 31) composing 78 percent of the market.
Capital markets remain underdeveloped. There are no equity markets, and corporate debt market is very small.
Only bond issues from seven companies were traded in the market in 2014. Central bank certificates and
government papers are the main securities traded in the market. Despite a low number of operations in the
securities exchange, there are 12 brokerage houses, about half of them associated with banks.

STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
Economic activity maintains a strong momentum, aided by a favorable external
environment and a strengthened policy framework. Domestic demand has been the main
growth engine, supported by an expansion in employment, robust credit growth, lower oil prices,
and the recovery in the U.S. Inflation remained low, the current account deficit contracted, and key
social indicators improved. The implementation of sound policies has underpinned the strong
economic performance. The inflation targeting framework has been successful at maintaining
inflation expectations around the official target range in the face of positive supply shocks, and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

notable fiscal consolidation efforts over the past three years have slowed further increases in public
debt. Going forward, as some of the external tailwinds dissipate, the economy is expected to slow to
its potential growth of 4½–5 percent. The challenge for macroeconomic policies will be to sustain
high growth rates and address remaining poverty and inequality challenges, further strengthening
the fiscal position, limiting risks of negative international spillovers and tackling long-term legacies
in the electricity sector.
33.
Fiscal sustainability and social spending pressures require renewed attention to
strengthening the fiscal position. Over the medium-term, public debt is set to rise due to large
consolidated deficits, and additional pressures are building from the need to sustain adequate
infrastructure and social spending. The authorities’ continued commitment to fiscal discipline is
welcome, and the favorable cyclical position provides a good opportunity to undertake the
adjustment to put debt on a downward path. A major effort is needed to expand the narrow tax
base, eroded by tax exemptions and incentives, and to tackle inefficient spending, including on
generalized electricity subsidies. The strides achieved over the past decade in building up
institutions are notable, but there is merit in further strengthening the fiscal framework by anchoring
annual policy decision-making to sustainability objectives and improving the quality of spending.
The risk profile of public debt would benefit from reduced reliance on foreign currency borrowing,
which necessitates further development of the domestic bond market in coordination with the
central bank, a major issuer in the market.
34.
The monetary policy stance is appropriate in guiding inflation back to target range,
but a strengthened framework could further improve policy effectiveness and outcomes. The
strong economic outlook, waning supply shocks, and tightening labor markets are reducing the
scope for further interest rate cuts. The tightening bias is therefore appropriate in guarding against
upside risks to inflation. Transition towards more exchange rate flexibility and the continued buildup
of reserves will increase resilience against external spillovers and shocks. The challenges of
managing monetary policy and legacy quasi-fiscal debts should be tackled through increased
coordination with the fiscal authorities in avoiding overlap between two issuers to develop the local
bond markets and in firming up the recapitalization arrangements.
35.
The resilience of the financial system has been strengthened over the past years in
tandem with improved bank supervision. The regulatory reform agenda for the banking system
needs to be further advanced towards best international practice, and pockets of rapid credit growth
warrant monitoring. At the same time, the supervision of non-bank financial intermediaries remains
weak and―although these are not systemic―vigilance is needed against inherent risks, especially
those related to potential AML/CFT activities.
36.
Sustaining strong economic growth and making it more inclusive will require
concerted reform efforts. The authorities’ reforms in education, strengthening social safety nets,
and in promoting financial inclusion should help boost growth and improve social outcomes.
Addressing long-standing problems in the electricity sector remains key to improving growth
prospects. Needed measures include significant upgrades to the public distribution networks, a
move towards cost recovery pricing and reducing regulatory uncertainty. The latter would also foster

a stronger investment climate needed to narrow infrastructure gaps, while increased product market
competition and labor market flexibility would strengthen the economy’s competitiveness.

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely
to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the
risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability
between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the
source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive
risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Past policy advice
Over the past few years, Fund advice focused on: (i) continuing fiscal consolidation to put debt on a
sustainable downward path; (ii) allowing additional exchange rate flexibility by limiting the
interventions only to counter disorderly market conditions; (iii) resuming the recapitalization of the
central bank at levels envisaged in the 2007 legislation, and (iv) addressing the bottlenecks in the
electricity sector. The authorities undertook a significant consolidation through tax reform and
expenditure restraint over the past three years, halving the central government deficit to 2⅔
percent. The exchange rate continues to depreciate at a broadly 3-4 percent a year crawl vis-à-vis
the U.S. dollar, with interventions on both sides of the market. Recapitalization transfers remain
below levels envisaged in the legislation, in part as a result of the limited fiscal envelope. Efforts in
the electricity sector have focused on diversifying the energy matrix and reducing distribution losses,
but substantive reforms will be underpinned by the outcomes of the ongoing discussions of the
electricity pact.

Annex II. Macroeconomic Impact of the Decline in Oil Prices
The significant decline in world oil prices since mid-2014 represented a positive terms-of-trade
shock for the Dominican Republic as a net oil importer. This annex elaborates on four key areas of
macroeconomic gains associated with the decline in oil prices: stronger economic activity, lower
inflation, fiscal savings, and an improvement in the external position.

Economic Activity
Economic activity was affected through a positive impulse to domestic demand, a favorable supply
cost shock, and likely through higher external demand for Dominican goods and services by partner
countries that also enjoyed an increase in real disposable incomes.
a. Domestic demand: The drop in oil prices generated an increase in real disposable income,
which in turn, boosted private consumption to the degree that it was not fully saved. While a
considerable share of the increase in domestic demand is estimated to have leaked out through
higher imports, the net impact on economic activity is estimated to have been positive.
b. Supply: The reduction in oil prices has translated into lower production and transportation costs
for businesses, which helped boost corporate profits, lead to an expansion of productive
capacity and increased investment, or indirectly supported credit activity to the extent that
higher corporate gains were recycled through the domestic financial system.
c. External demand: As a highly open economy, the Dominican Republic has likely benefitted
from lower oil prices indirectly through higher external demand for its goods and services. Its
main export destinations and key tourism source markets are generally net oil importers, hence
overall external demand is likely to have been positively affected.1
Staff estimated empirically the potential overall impact on economic activity using regression
analysis, VAR, and a structural model. When relevant, the calculations were based on the assumption
that the pattern of private consumption and private investment, as well as the share of imports, do
not significantly deviate from the trend over the last five years. Staff estimates suggest that the 47
percent drop in oil prices in 2015 has added about 0.6–0.7 percentage points to economic growth in
2015.2

The U.S. is by far the largest trade partner and tourist source market of the Dominican Republic, accounting for
49 percent of total Dominican exports in 2014 and 45 percent of total tourist arrivals over the period January-August
2015. The group of net oil exporters accounts for less than 10 percent of exports and about 12 percent of total
tourist arrivals over the same period.

While alternative techniques and empirical specifications produce a wide range of results, they are typically
centered on 0.6–0.7 percentage points higher growth, with the upper bound at 1 percentage point.

Inflation
Headline inflation has been directly affected via three key categories of the consumption basket—
fuels, transport and household costs—where the pass-through of international price changes is fast
and substantial.3 In addition, oil prices are estimated to have affected core and headline inflation
through second-round price effects related to retail, logistics, and distribution channels. Staff
estimates that the drop in global oil prices have lowered domestic headline inflation by about 1-1¼
percentage points through end-2015, mainly through lower fuel, transport, and household costs,
while core inflation has been about 0.4 percentage points lower due to second-round effects.

Fiscal Position
The fiscal position is exposed to oil price changes primarily through the ad valorem components of
fuel taxes, the favorable source of financing provided under the Petrocaribe agreement, and the
overall deficit of the public electricity sector. While a drop in fuel prices will translate into lower tax
revenues and lower financing under the terms of the Petrocaribe agreement, it will also result in
lower costs for electricity generation (fuels account for about half of total generation) and hence
smaller deficit for the public electricity sector. Overall, the savings in the electricity sector have more

The pass-through from international fuel prices to the reference fuel import prices that are used as an input in the
calculation of the final consumer price of fuels is almost complete with a lag of less than two weeks. Nonetheless, the
reference fuel import prices represent only about 40 percent of the overall final consumer fuel prices, with the rest
being determined mainly by fixed taxes, charges, and margins.

than compensated for the loss in fuel tax revenues and interest savings related to Petrocaribe,
resulting in an improvement of the fiscal position of about 0.4 percent of GDP in 2015.
a. Ad valorem fuel taxes: The ad valorem fuel taxes represent about 16 percent of the import fuel
price.4 Staff estimates that direct fiscal revenues loss in 2015 was about 0.2 percent of GDP.
b. Petrocaribe financing: The Dominican Republic has been receiving long-term financing at

interest rates significantly below market

levels under the Petrocaribe agreement

since 2005. While the arrangement has

resulted in significant interest savings,
Petrocaribe financing for the Dominican

Republic has been considerably less

important than for other countries in the
region. Moreover, it has not been
1
earmarked for specific social projects as is
0
the case with other countries, suggesting
GUY NIC HTI BLZ JAM ATG DMA KNA VCT GRD DOM
that the risk for discontinuation of public
projects is lower. Staff estimates that the need to substitute Petrocaribe financing with costlier
sources may imply higher annual interest costs for the public sector of up to 0.03–0.04 percent
of GDP.
c. Electricity sector savings: Lower oil prices have provided significant savings for the public
electricity sector (transmission and distribution), as oil fuels represent the most important source
of electricity generation in the Dominican Republic. Staff estimates that the 47 percent drop in
oil prices in 2015 have reduced the deficit of the electricity sector by about 0.6 percent of GDP.
In turn, this lower overall deficit has allowed the electricity sector to avoid further accumulation
of arrears to private generators, reduce its current level of arrears, as well as lower the fiscal
transfers it is expected to receive in 2015.

External Position
The drop in oil prices has translated into a significant reduction of the oil import bill, which was
partly offset by the response of oil volumes. Taking into account the higher-than-initially-projected
jump in oil import volumes of 18 percent in the first half of 2015, staff estimates a decline in the
value of oil imports from 5.6 percent of GDP in 2014 to 3.4 percent of GDP in 2015. As the change in
oil prices is unlikely to have a significant impact on the non-trade components of the current
account, the oil import bill savings are estimated to have directly contributed to an improvement in
the current account of about 2.2 percent of GDP.

The ad valorem component of fuel taxes is levied as 16 percent of the import fuel price for most fuels in accordance
with Law 495 from 2006. For Avtur the ad valorem tax is levied at 6.5 percent.

Annex III. External Sector Assessment
The current account and real exchange rate are broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals and
desired policy settings. Persistent current account deficits, financed through foreign direct investment
(FDI) flows and to a lesser extent public external debt accumulation, continue to deteriorate the net
international investment position. Reserves remain well below the Fund’s risk-weighted adequacy
metric.

A. Current Account and Exchange Rate Assessment
While recent current account improvements have strengthened the external balance, the
cyclically adjusted current account balance is close to its norm. According to the EBA-lite current
account panel regression the estimated adjusted current account norm for 2015 is -3.4 percent of
GDP which accounts for a slight policy gap of -0.4 percent of GDP.1 Hence, the estimated deficit of
2.0 percent of GDP for 2015 suggests a current account gap of 1.4 percent of GDP. However, most
of the improvements in the external balance over the past year have been due to the sharp fall in
global oil prices. When adjusting for the partial recovery of oil prices over the medium term, the
estimated gap narrows to 0.7 percent of GDP, indicating that the actual current account is broadly in
line with fundamentals and desired policy settings. Moreover, assuming an exchange rate elasticity
of 16 percent, the adjusted current account gap suggests that the real exchange rate is 4 percent
weaker than fundamentals and desired policies.

Three policy variables are included in the panel regression: the cyclically adjusted fiscal balance as a share of GDP,
the change in reserve assets as a share of GDP, and the private credit-to-GDP ratio. The respective policy gaps are
calculated as the difference between the current values of these variables and their desired medium-term levels. The
combined policy gap for Dominican Republic is estimated at -0.4 percent of GDP. For more details about the
methodology see “The External Balance Assessment (EBA) Methodology,” IMF Working Paper 13/272.

approach.
The current account deficit will widen over the
medium term, but is deemed sustainable at an
acceptable level of the international
investment position (IIP). The deficit is
projected to increase to 3.1 percent by 2020 and
will continue to be primarily financed through FDI
flows and government borrowing. According to
the external sustainability approach, stabilizing
the net IIP at the 2014 level would require a
current account deficit of 3.0 percent of GDP,
indicating that the underlying deficit is only
marginally weaker than its norm.

B. International Investment Position and External Debt
While persistent current account deficits have deteriorated the net IIP over the past decade, it
is expected to stabilize at the current level. Net foreign liabilities doubled between 2005 and
2014, from 32 to 61 present of GDP. However, two-thirds of the increase reflected non-debt creating
flows in terms of foreign direct investment in the tourism, manufacturing and mining industries.
Meanwhile, overall gross external debt rose from 28 to 38 percent, mainly due to increased public
external borrowing. Going forward, consistent with the external sustainability analysis the net IIP
level is projected to stabilize at around 60 percent of GDP over the medium term.
The composition and maturity of gross public external debt has changed, reflecting more
favorable external financial conditions. Low global interest rates and increased demand for
emerging market debt have encouraged issuance of public debt securities in favor of loans.
Following the debt restructuring deal with PetroCaribe and increased issuance of dollar
denominated bonds in 2015, external public debt securities are now estimated to account for more
than half of the total external debt compared to a only a quarter in 2008. On the other hand, the

40

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

maturity of the public external debt stock has also risen. The share of short-term public debt is
estimated to have fallen from approximately one third in 2008 to a projected less than a one tenth
in 2015.
Overall gross external debt is projected to rise moderately over the medium term and remain
only moderately sensitive to a number of shocks. The restructuring deal with PetroCaribe helped
lower external debt from 38 percent of GDP in 2014 to an estimated 35 percent in 2015 (see Table
1). Over the medium term gross financing needs will range between 6 and 7 percent of GDP,
primarily reflecting debt and debt service falling due. Non-debt creating flows are expected to cover
about one third of these financing needs, while the rest will be financed by rolling over existing debt
and issuing some new debt. Consequently, gross external debt is projected to rise moderately to
36 percent of GDP by 2020. The external debt sustainability analysis indicates that the medium term
debt profile is resilient to a number of shocks including a one-half standard deviation shock to the
interest rate, growth rate and non-interest current account (see Figure 1). A 30 percent real
depreciation shock, however, would lower the value of GDP in U.S. dollars and increase the medium
term external debt level to 52 percent by 2020.

C. Reserve Adequacy
While reserves continue to increase gradually, they remain considerably lower than the Fund’s
risk-weighted adequacy measure. Despite continued strong FDI inflows and improvements in the
current account, reserves are projected to grow by 0.4 US$ billion in 2015. While the reserve
adequacy has improved relative to some standard benchmarks (see table) it remains well below the
Fund’s risk-based metric which requires coverage against medium and long-term external debt.
However, a mitigating factor is that public borrowings accounts for the majority of long-term
external liabilities—with about half of it owed to official creditors and with a protracted schedule of
amortization. Moreover, sources of foreign exchange are relatively diverse, reflecting inflows from
tourism, remittances and gold. Over the medium term, reserve adequacy is projected to further
improve, albeit still below the Fund’s risk-weighted metric.

Annex IV. Updated Debt Sustainability Analysis1
Gross debt levels in Dominican Republic, estimated at 48.5 percent of GDP at end-2015, remain
moderate. Gross financing needs remain below 10 percent of GDP over the entire forecast horizon.
However, given the relatively large share of foreign currency denominated debt, large and sudden
exchange rate depreciation could raise the public debt-to-GDP trajectory. Against this background, the
different DSA scenarios presented in this section suggest that Dominican Republic’s public debt is
sustainable, i.e. will remain below 60 percent of GDP, even under the most extreme shocks. Only the
impact of lower real GDP growth shifts the debt trajectory up significantly, but even under such a
scenario, gross debt remains below 60 percent of GDP. With the exception of the share of debt held by
non-residents and public debt held in foreign currency, public debt profile indicators remain below the
upper early warning benchmarks.

A. Realism of Baseline Scenario
Debt. The modest increase in gross debt levels in 2015 relative to 2014 is largely due to the PDVSA
debt buy-back operation. Although there are plans for further gradual consolidation of central
government’s budget in 2016, large deficits from the non-financial public sector (electricity
generators primarily) are contributing to a projected increase in gross debt levels, particularly in
2016 and 2017 (during which the construction of new power plants is set to take place). The primary
balance is projected to improve in 2018, but it does not reach the debt-stabilizing level—0.7 percent
of GDP—by 2020 under the staff’s baseline scenario. As a result, debt remains on a rising trajectory
over the forecast horizon.
Growth. Past projections of growth outcomes suggest moderate forecast errors. These show a
tendency for pessimistic forecasts, most recently in 2014 when Dominican Republic recorded an
impressive 7.3 percent economic growth (one of the highest in Latin America). Dominican Republic’s
debt dynamics are also sensitive to sudden changes in GDP growth, as indicated by the relevance of
growth shocks under the DSA stress tests. In this context, should growth turn out to be higher than
expected over the forecast horizon, it will impact positively on debt.
Fiscal adjustment. Under the baseline, there is a significant adjustment in the cyclically-adjusted
primary balance in 2015, which is explained by the classification of the discounted portion of the
PDVSA debt as a grant in central government accounts. This also has an impact on the distribution
of fiscal adjustment episodes provided in the DSA template, which puts Dominican Republic in the
top quartile based on the projected adjustment of the cyclically-adjusted primary balance over 3
years during the forecast horizon. Without the PDVSA grant, which amounts to some 3.1 percent of
GDP, the projected adjustment in the cyclically-adjusted primary balance would not be considered
infeasible. From 2015 onward, the fiscal impulse converges to zero, implying a broadly neutral fiscal

activities of the central bank.

policy in the absence of major policy changes (for example, implementation of measures under a
future fiscal pact).
Sovereign yields. As of January 2016, Dominican Republic’s sovereign bonds have a credit spread
of 447 basis points relative to U.S. Treasury Bonds, and compare favorably relative to other
emerging-market and Latin-American countries (with average spreads of 669 and 515 basis points,
respectively). Bond yields have been on an upward trend since July when the U.S. Federal Reserve
announced the possibility of raising rates, with the 10-year local currency bond yield at 568 basis
points as of October 9, 2015. However, given upward projections for the U.S. Treasury bills and Libor
rates over the medium term, the effective nominal interest rate on Dominican Republic’s sovereign
debt is projected to increase from 3.7 percent in 2014 to 8.8 percent by 2020. In May, Standard &
Poor’s upgraded Dominican Republic’s foreign-currency credit rating to BB-. On account of
continued positive performance relative to peers, Fitch recently revised its outlook for Dominican
Republic’s sovereign rating from stable to positive and affirmed a B+ rating.

B. Debt Profile
Maturity, currency composition and rollover. The sovereign bond placements in January 2015
have lengthened the average maturity of debt (now estimated at around 10 years for total nonfinancial public sector debt) and lowered the variable rate risk. Given the large share of foreigncurrency denominated debt (some 60 percent of total debt), a real exchange rate depreciation could
have a significant effect on debt dynamics. Furthermore, some 55 percent of total gross debt is held
by non-residents, making rollover risk sensitive to shifts in market sentiment. However, since most of
the non-resident holdings are held at maturities longer than one year, rollover risks are deemed
reasonable at present.

C. Stochastic Simulations
Fan charts. The fan charts illustrate the possible evolution of the debt ratio over the medium term
and are based on both the symmetric and asymmetric distributions of risk. Under the symmetric
distribution of risk, there is a 75 percent probability that debt will be below 60 percent of GDP over
the medium term. If restrictions are imposed on the primary balance (i.e. the asymmetric scenario,
where it is assumed that there are no positive shocks to the primary balance), the debt path is still
projected to remain below 60 percent of GDP over the projection horizon.

D. Stress Tests
Real GDP growth shock. The debt ratio appears to remain under 55 percent of GDP under all
scenarios except the growth shock where it reaches 60 percent of GDP by the end of the projection
horizon. This scenario also results in a drastic increase in public gross financing needs in 2017, in
addition to the increase in 2019 that is evident in all scenarios (this is related to a large principal
payment that is due on external debt).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Combined shock. Since the combined shock incorporates the largest effect of individual shocks on
all relevant variables (real GDP growth, inflation, primary balance, exchange rate and interest rate), it
produces the most extreme debt trajectory. Under this scenario, debt exceeds 60 percent of GDP in
2019, and results in average gross financing needs of around 11 percent of GDP over the medium
term.

Annex V. Interest Rate Pass-Through
A well-functioning monetary transmission mechanism is critical for monetary policy. As the Dominican
Republic recently adopted an inflation targeting regime, it is even more relevant to guarantee that
changes in the monetary policy rates are quickly and fully reflected in retail rates, to eventually
influence aggregate demand and inflation. The interest rate pass-through of the monetary policy rate
to retail rates is complete, confirming the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission
mechanism. However, the pass-through to lending rates is faster than to deposit rates and short-term
rates adjust asymmetrically, with deposit rates responding faster to policy rate cuts and lending rates
responding faster to policy rate hikes. More competition in the financial system could help achieving a
symmetric adjustment of retail rates.

A. Background
The recent history of the Dominican Republic’s monetary policy starts with the Monetary and
Financial Law of 2002. The law strengthened the institutional framework for the conduct of
monetary policy by establishing price stability as the main central bank’s mandate. Starting in 2004,
the central bank moved away from exchange rate targeting and transitioned to monetary targeting.
In this context, it introduced an overnight deposit window and a Lombard facility, which created a
corridor for the interbank rate. The overnight rate served as signal of the monetary policy stance.
The monetary targeting anticipated the transition to the inflation targeting regime. While the
central bank managed to significantly reduce inflation and stabilize the economy under the
monetary targeting, financial innovation and deregulation as well as financial sector reforms
generated a growing instability in money demand, weakening the relationship between money and
inflation (Andújar, 2014).1 To strengthen monetary policy effectiveness, the central bank adopted an
inflation targeting regime in January 2012. Starting in February 2013, the authorities introduced the
monetary policy rate as the benchmark rate, which is in the middle of a corridor bounded by the
one-day deposit and expansion facilities.

B. Financial System Concentration
Since the financial crisis of 2003–04, the financial system developed considerably but remains
highly concentrated. As of June 2015, the system is composed of 65 financial entities with assets
over 45 percent of GDP and a loan portfolio of about 27 percent of GDP.2 Most of the loans go to
the commercial sector (58.7 percent), while the remainder is split between personal consumption
loans (24 percent) and mortgage loans (17.3 percent). Commercial and mortgage loans are usually

Economía, Vol. 5, pp. 99-120.

The financial system consists of 17 commercial banks (85.8 percent of the system assets), 10 saving and credit
institutions (11.1 percent of the system assets), 19 credit unions (1.9 percent of the system assets), several credit
corporations (0.3 percent of the system assets), and a development bank (0.9 percent of the system assets).

banks represented 57.5 percent of deposits and 58.2 percent of loans, while as of June 2015 they
represent 67.7 percent of deposits and 69.0 percent of loans.

The degree of concentration is often associated with high profits for banks as well as
asymmetries in the adjustment of retail rates to the monetary policy rates. In the Dominican
Republic, spreads are high at all maturities (6.5 percent on average for three-month spread over
2006–15) and vary significantly when the monetary policy rate changes. This suggests that deposit
and lending rates may either react differently to changes in the monetary policy rate, react
asymmetrically to lifts and cuts in the monetary policy rate, or both.

C. Completeness, Speed of Adjustment, and Asymmetries
There are several possible explanations as to why the interest rate pass-through may be slow,
incomplete, more than complete, or asymmetric. These include asymmetric information, menu
costs, switching costs, risk sharing, ownership of the financial system, economic conditions, and
bank concentration. While the empirical literature for advanced and emerging economies is vast, the
evidence for the Dominican Republic remains limited. In general, previous studies found evidence of
overpass-through to lending rates, albeit the results present a significant variation in the estimated
pass-through. As for the deposit rates, results are generally mixed, with estimates ranging from
incomplete to overpass-through.
The econometric analysis reveals that the pass-through to deposit and lending rates is
complete, confirming the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, but
speed varies and it is sometimes asymmetric. The features of the interest rate pass-through are
assessed by relying on error correction and momentum-threshold autoregressive models estimated
for several retail rates with monthly data over the period June 2006-June 2015. While the passthrough results statistically complete, the results also suggest that the pass-through to lending rates
is generally faster than to deposit rates. Moreover, the retail rates’ adjustment can be asymmetric,
with short-term deposit rates responding faster to monetary policy rate cuts than hikes, and shortterm lending rates responding faster to monetary policy rate hikes than cuts. Reducing bank
concentration by fostering competition in the financial system could be instrumental in enhancing
the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission mechanism by reducing asymmetries in the
adjustment of retail rates.

Annex VI. Balance Sheet Approach for the Dominican Republic
The overall balance sheet of the economy has deteriorated in the aftermath of the global financial
crisis. The worsening is almost completely driven by the non-financial public sector (NFPS), as its
reliance on foreign currency borrowing from both domestic and external sources has increased. The
financial position of other sectors of the economy slightly improved and remains healthy. External
risks seem to be limited, as liabilities are balanced towards FDI and the short-term position in
foreign currency is strong. The main source of risk comes from the public sector’s vulnerability to an
external shock, which could spill over to the rest of the economy, especially the financial system.
The Balance Sheet Approach (BSA) was developed as a framework to understand financial
crises. It was proposed by Allen et al. (2002)1 on the basis of the financial events of the late 1990s
and early 2000s, and has been applied to many emerging-market economies since then. The BSA
studies stocks of financial assets and liabilities and analyzes the risks related to currency and
maturity mismatches at the aggregate economy level and for each economic sector. Moreover, it
distinguishes vulnerabilities associated with liquidity and solvency problems, and reveals
potential spillovers across sectors that can transmit the impact of economic shocks.
The main instrument for the analysis is the balance sheet matrix. The economy is
disaggregated into six sectors: (i) the central bank; (ii) the non-financial public sector, which
includes the central government, state and local governments, public non-financial corporations;
(iii) the other depository corporations (ODC), which include commercial banks and other deposittaking institutions; (iv) other financial corporations (OFC), which in the case of the Dominican
Republic include only pension funds; (v) the non-financial private sector, which includes nonfinancial corporations (NFPC), and other domestic resident sector (largely households); and (vi)
the rest of the world or nonresidents. Within each sector, assets and liabilities are decomposed
into foreign and domestic currency, and to the extent data are available, by maturity (see table 1
for the matrix).2
Since 2005, the net financial position of the overall economy has worsened, but there are
important differences among sectors. The net asset position of the economy deteriorated
from -22 percent of GDP in 2005 to -50 percent of GDP in 2014, owing to persistent fiscal
deficits, which led to a weaker net position of the NFPS. On the other hand, the recovery of the
banking system after the 2003–04 crisis turned the net position of the sector from net debtor to
net creditor (vis-a-vis the rest of the economy). Similarly, the central bank's net creditor position
has improved, amid a reduction in foreign currency liabilities and accumulation of reserves.
Though it remained a net creditor during the last ten years, the net financial position of the

While the economy has large foreign liabilities, the share of equity in these liabilities has
increased importantly, helping reduce capital structure risks.3 Excluding FDI liabilities, the
economy’s net debtor position deteriorated by only 9 percentage points of GDP over the last 10
years, increasing to 16 percent of GDP. Short-term risks arising from maturity mismatches have
decreased significantly over the last ten years thanks to an increase of international reserves, new
public borrowing at longer maturities, as well as an increase of banks deposits abroad and
private sector deposits in foreign currency relative to their short-term foreign currency liabilities.

contributors to a strong short-term financial position. In terms of currency mismatches, on the
other hand, the sector has a net debtor position in foreign currency of 18.3 percent of GDP,4
indicating that the NFPS would suffer large losses in the event of an exchange rate shock. In the
case of 30 percent depreciation, the negative impact on the NFPS would be about 8.3 percent of
GDP (table 2).
The banking sector. The banking sector is highly liquid and maintains a close-to-balance net
foreign currency position, but has increased exposure to the public sector. The average net
foreign currency position of the sector over the past ten years is 0.6 percent of GDP and the
estimated 2014 position was -0.2 percent of GDP. The position deteriorated over the last five
years as deposits of nonresidents in foreign currency increased.5 Within this exposure, banks

when banks’ short-term position was negative.
The nonfinancial private sector. The nonfinancial private sector does not appear vulnerable to
currency and maturity risks. The sector has a net creditor position in foreign currency of around
6.7 percent of GDP against nonresidents and banks - the only two sectors to which it is exposed.
While there is no disaggregation of external assets by subsector, households are net creditors
vis-à-vis banks, whereas firms are net debtors. Maturity risks in foreign currency positions are
minimal, given that short-term foreign currency deposits are significantly larger than short-term
foreign currency liabilities. Moreover, such a strong creditor position makes the private sector the
main potential beneficiary from currency depreciations; however, such an impact is estimated to
be small compared to the negative impact on the NFPS (1.7 percent of GDP in the case of 30
percent depreciation; see table 2).

4

The position increases to 20.2 percent of GDP once multiple banks claims on central bank reserves –related to
required reserves on FX deposits- are also taken into account.

5
The current financial regulation on the limits on foreign currency open position is relatively relaxed, allowing
banks to have an open foreign currency net position of up to 100 percent of capital.

The network map of intersectoral linkages illustrates the vulnerabilities and potential
spillovers discussed above. In figure 1 below, the nodes represent the size of the net financial
position of each sector, while the thickness of the links between the nodes point to the size of
the exposure. The network shows that NFPS could be an important source of vulnerability and
spillover: given the financial interlinkages, a shock related to the external funding to the
government could adversely affect the balance sheets of the other sectors, in particular the
financial sector. The adverse impact on banks could in turn reduce credit supply to the rest of the
economy and lead to an overall economic slowdown. Bank exposures are even more pronounced
if we take into account that around 56 percent of total domestic lending to the NFPS is coming
from the largest bank in the system -which also holds 30 percent of total system deposits.
Distress in the NFPS would also affect the already weak financial position of the central bank by
further increasing its quasi-fiscal deficit, and thus affecting monetary policy. Finally, since the
pension funds invest a large portion of households’ savings in governments bonds, its solvency
could be compromised as the indirect exposure of the households to the sovereign increases.

Exchange Rate Arrangement. The Dominican Republic’s de jure exchange rate arrangement is
classified as “managed floating”, while the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a
“crawl-like arrangement.” Over the last two years, the peso has been depreciating against the U.S.
dollar by an average rate of 4 percent per year. The Dominican Republic maintains an exchange
system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX

As of December 31, 2015
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, with some data shortcomings. Most
macroeconomic statistics are compiled by the Central Bank, with the National Statistics Office producing
underlying surveys and the population census. Fiscal data are compiled by the Ministry of Finance.
National Accounts: The Central Bank updated the base year of the national accounts to 2007 in August 2014;
the previous base year was 1991. This initiative benefitted from both IMF technical assistance and input from
other experts. Staff from the IMF’s Statistics Department has reviewed the methodology and has provided
comments and suggestions, which have been largely incorporated. The Monthly Index of Economic Activity
(Indice Mensual de Actividad Económica) is now published by the Central Bank on its website.
Price Statistics: CPI data has a base date of December 2010; weights are based on the survey of Income and
Expense of Households of 2007-2008. The Central Bank has implemented improvements in the adjustments for
seasonal and missing price imputations, changes in product specifications and quality, and new products. It has
also harmonized the index with those of Central America and Panama as part of a regional harmonization
project.
Government Finance Statistics: Both the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank compile and disseminate
government finance statistics (GFS).
Data are generally not available for the consolidated general government, as data coverage on local
governments and some non-central government entities is incomplete and not timely. The authorities have
made progress in fiscal data presentation, but the lack of a suitable classification of data on the execution of
the budget remains a constraint on effectively monitoring fiscal developments during the year. The authorities
have not yet transitioned to the GFSM 2014 framework, and may need technical assistance to do so.
The country participates in a regional project for the harmonization of GFS for Central America, Panama, and
the Dominican Republic. The authorities are currently working to implement International Public Sector
Accounting Standards (IPSAS) and introduce a results-based program budgeting system. The authorities are
encouraged to involve strategic units in elaborating the chart of accounts under IPSAS, create a GFS committee
to reconcile fiscal data, and review the regulatory framework for financial management prior to the adoption of
international standards.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: The country has reported monetary data to STA in the standardized report
forms (SRFs) since August 2007, and this has been the base for national publications since July 2009. SRFsbased data has helped improve coverage and classification of the data. The SRFs were developed in the context
of a regional project for the harmonization of monetary and financial statistics in Central America and the
Dominican Republic that ended in December 2008. Currently, the central bank disseminates the harmonized
monetary statistics via its web page.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

Financial sector surveillance: The Dominican Republic has begun reporting Financial Soundness Indicators
(FSIs) to the IMF on a monthly basis with data beginning in 2008. The Dominican Republic’s FSIs have been
posted, and are now available, on the IMF’s FSIs website (http://fsi.imf.org).
External sector statistics: The authorities started disseminating balance of payments (BOP) statistics according
to BPM6 in March 2015. Problems of coverage remain for exports, imports, factor services, capital transfers,
income, and the financial account including the private sector, giving rise to large errors and omissions. External
debt statistics, notably for the private sector, also require further improvements. Several technical assistance
missions have assisted the BCRD in improving balance of payments statistics (including migration to BPM6),
external debt statistics and preparing the International Investment Position (IIP) data according to BPM6, which
are now available for the period 2010Q4–2015Q1, and need to be extended backwards.
II. Data Standards and Quality
The country is a GDDS participant. However, most of

Data ROSC was published on June 27, 2006.

its metadata, with the exception of the fiscal sector
and socio-demographic metadata, were last updated
in June 2007. Fiscal sector metadata was last updated
in November 2005, while socio-demographic
metadata are not available. The authorities are
working to update the metadata.
