IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Congo
On July 17, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Republic of Congo on a lapse-of-time basis, and considered and
endorsed the staff appraisal without a meeting.1 2
Growth was strong and inflation moderated in 2014 but the Republic of Congo has been hit hard
by the oil price shock. Growth rose to 6.8 percent in 2014, driven by a rebound in oil production.
Inflation eased to 0.5 percent at end–2014 (y/y), driven mainly by lower global food prices. The
fiscal deficit amounted to 8.5 percent of GDP in 2014, a near doubling from 2013, owing mostly
to increased spending and the lower oil revenues. The fiscal deficit was mainly financed by
borrowing from the regional central bank and by drawing on government deposits held abroad.
The current account deficit widened by one percent of GDP to 5½ percent of GDP in 2014.
However, official reserves held at the BEAC increased by CFAF 189 billion to
CFAF 2,698 billion at end-2014, owing to the repatriation of commercial banks’ deposits and
government deposits held abroad. As a consequence, the Republic of Congo’s international
reserves and government deposits at the regional central bank remain at about 9½ months of
prospective imports and 20 percent of GDP, respectively, both the highest among members of
the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC). Public debt now amounts
to about 36½ percent of GDP, up from 32 percent of GDP in 2013 and from 20 percent of GDP
in 2010, following the HIPC Completion Point. The authorities are taking corrective fiscal
measures by reining in investment expenditure in a supplementary 2015 budget.
Robust growth in recent years has not resulted in a broad-based improvement in living standards.
Growth averaged 5 percent over the last 5 years as government spending was ramped up,

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.
2

The lapse-of-time procedure is proposed for article IV consultations where the following conditions apply: (i) there
are no acute or significant risks, or general policy issues requiring Board discussion; (ii) policies or circumstances
are unlikely to have significant regional or global impact; (iii) in the event a parallel program review is being
completed, it is also being completed on a lapse-of-time basis; and (iv) the use of Fund resources is not under
discussion or anticipated.

financed mostly by rising oil revenues. This translated into increased activity in the agriculture,
industry and services sectors. Nevertheless, the Republic of Congo continues to suffer from high
rates of poverty and inequality, large infrastructure gaps, and important development challenges.
The near- and medium-term outlook will be shaped by developments in the oil sector and the
path and quality of fiscal adjustment. Oil production is expected to decline in 2015 mainly due to
the delay in the coming on stream of a new oil field. GDP growth in 2015 is projected at
1 percent and to average about 3 percent per annum during 2015–20. The lower international oil
price is projected to lead to deterioration in the current account and continued pressure on the
budget. Over the period to 2018, the expected increase in oil production from the coming on
stream of new oil fields should improve fiscal and external balances. From 2018, this trend is
likely to reverse as oil production declines. Non-oil growth is projected to slow to about
3 percent in 2015–16, as public investment spending contracts and mining projects are delayed
due to the uncertain global outlook for iron ore. Inflation is projected at 2½ percent over the
medium term, underpinned by the pegged exchange rate regime. Risks to the outlook relate to oil
price volatility, persistently low oil prices, accumulation of domestic payment arrears, and
domestic instability.
Executive Board Assessment
Growth was strong and inflation moderated in 2014. Growth rose to 6.8 percent in 2014, driven
by a rebound in oil production. Inflation eased to 0.5 percent at end–2014 (year-on-year), driven
mainly by lower global food prices.
But Congo has been hit hard by the oil price shock. The fiscal deficit amounted to 8.5 percent of
GDP in 2014, a near doubling from 2013, owing mostly to increased spending and the lower oil
receipts. The current account balance also deteriorated.
The economy is projected to expand by about 3 percent per annum during 2015–20 as new oil
fields come on stream. Though necessary, the fiscal consolidation implied by the supplementary
budget is expected to result in growth slowing to 1 percent in 2015. Risks to the outlook relate to
oil price volatility, persistently low oil prices, accumulation of domestic payment arrears, and
domestic instability. While Congo’s real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with
macroeconomic fundamentals, the performance of non-oil exports is weak and points to
competitiveness concerns.
The 2015 supplementary budget should be passed swiftly and its implementation monitored
closely. The authorities should weigh carefully their response to revenue shortfalls and
expenditure overruns. Maintaining deposits at the regional central bank would provide a buffer in
the event of additional adverse shocks. Contingency plans should be prepared to address
downside risks.
Safeguarding fiscal and debt sustainability will require a coherent medium-term fiscal
adjustment strategy. In view of the limited remaining lifetime of oil reserves, and continued low
prices, fiscal policy should be anchored on a gradual multi-year reduction in the non-oil primary
deficit. The rise in government debt since the 2010 HIPC/MDRI relief in addition to the
drawdown of oil reserves, underscores the importance of continued adherence to a prudent

3

borrowing policy that keeps the NPV of net debt below indicative DSA thresholds. This should
also be coordinated within the context of a revised CEMAC macroeconomic surveillance
framework (See CEMAC Staff Report).
Public expenditure should increasingly be oriented towards policies to support inclusive growth
and pro-poor programs. The link between the actions in the NDP and the annual budgets should
be clearly established during budget preparation, with a stronger focus on economic
diversification. The selection, evaluation, and monitoring of investment projects, as well as the
budgeting of their operating and maintenance costs, need to be strengthened. More broadly, the
authorities are encouraged to follow up on the recommendations from the PEFA and PEMFAR
to strengthen budget execution, procurement and disbursement processes and improve the
efficiency and quality of spending.
Fiscal adjustment should be underpinned by improved revenue policies and PFM reforms. There
is scope to boost non-oil revenues by limiting the use of reduced VAT rates and tax exemptions
whilst reinforcing tax and customs administration. PFM reforms should focus on improving the
quality of investment, resolving the accumulation of arrears, and ensuring comprehensive fiscal
reporting that consolidates off-budget spending, possibly with IMF technical assistance.
Financial sector reforms are essential to underpin growth, diversification and reduce inequality.
The financial sector should benefit from the authorities’ plans to revise its strategy in this sector
with a view to covering recent innovations and consistency with regional objectives. Key
priorities remain the improvement of the credit registry, establishing a property registry and a
unique window to register land titles, and strengthening the judicial framework. Promoting
broader usage of microfinance and mobile banking should also enhance financial access.
External sustainability should aim at maintaining a level of reserves above five months of
imports to support the exchange rate peg. The decline in oil prices, and its impact on foreign
exchange reserves, reinforces the importance of compliance with CEMAC reserves pooling
requirements to underpin the pegged exchange rate arrangement. In this regard, staff welcomes
the repatriation of part of Congo’s overseas deposits and recommends a continuation of this
policy.
The quality and timeliness of macroeconomic statistics needs urgent strengthening, to help
improve macroeconomic analysis and policymaking and ensure compliance with obligations
under Article VIII. Progress needs to be made in improving capacity and operationalizing the
NSSD. In particular, macroeconomic statistics should be unified across government agencies and
the national statistics agency should have adequate funding.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12–month
cycle.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Economic context. The Republic of Congo has been hit hard by the oil price shock.
Fiscal and current account balances deteriorated in 2014 reflecting increased
government spending and lower oil prices. Corrective measures are now being taken.
Private sector activity is held back by infrastructure gaps, a difficult business climate, and
a shallow financial system. Growth and spending have yet to translate into significant
reductions in poverty and progress in this area lags peers. Persistent inequality could be
a source of instability.
Outlook and Risks. The economy is projected to expand by about 3 percent per annum
during 2015–20 as new oil fields come on stream. The fiscal consolidation implied by the
proposed supplementary budget will hold back non-oil growth this year. Reduced oil
exports earnings and budget revenues are expected to lower external and fiscal buffers
in 2015. These should improve over the next three years in line with expanding oil
output. Risks to the outlook relate to oil price volatility, persistently low oil prices,
accumulation of domestic payment arrears, and domestic instability.
Policies. The 2015 supplementary budget should be passed swiftly and implementation
monitored closely. Over the medium term, fiscal and debt sustainability should be
ensured by a comprehensive and coherent fiscal adjustment strategy which incorporates
lower projected oil prices and the limited remaining lifetime of oil reserves. Effort should
also be made to bolster the quality of capital spending to maximize longer-term growth
and poverty reduction, and strengthen public financial management. Strengthening the
legal and institutional frameworks will support the business climate and financial sector
development and inclusion. Further repatriation of overseas deposits would increase
compliance with regional reserve pooling requirements and help safeguard the smooth
operation of the exchange rate peg.

Discussions took place in Brazzaville during May 19–June 1, 2015.
The staff team comprised Ms. Hakura (head) and Messrs. McLoughlin,
Jenkinson, and Issoufou (all AFR). The mission was assisted by
Mr. Tchicaya-Gondhet de Trebaud (resident economist). The team met
with the State Minister of Economy, Finance, Planning, Public Portfolio
and Integration, Mr. Ondongo, and other senior officials. The mission
also met with representatives of the private sector, civil society, and
development partners. The mission team received research support
from Messrs. Dernaoui and Mengistu, and administrative assistance
from Mmes. Ng Choy Hing and Koulefianou (all AFR). The Republic of
Congo is a member of the Central African Economic and Monetary
Community (CEMAC). The common currency, the CFA franc, is pegged
to the Euro.

BACKGROUND
1.
Robust growth is yet to result in a broad-based improvement in living standards.
Growth averaged 5 percent over the last 5 years as government spending was ramped up,
financed mostly by rising oil receipts. This translated into increased activity in agriculture,
industry and services. Nevertheless, the Republic of Congo continues to suffer from large
infrastructure gaps and the 2011 household survey showed limited progress in reducing poverty
and inequality, (Selected Issues Paper (SIP) Chapter 1). Against a background of uncertainty
about the future of oil prices and growth in key export markets, sharply lower oil receipts will
constrain efforts to address these development challenges. Limited progress in this area could
give rise to tensions and instability.

2.
The oil dependence requires a recalibration of policies. The current low international
oil price environment has increased the urgency for fiscal consolidation and underscores the
need to address pervasive development challenges. In view of the projected depletion of oil
reserves over the medium term, it is essential that the ongoing investment surge is effective and
supportive of economic diversification. The public investment program should therefore be
clearly oriented towards raising the potential growth of the non-oil economy – the main source
of employment – and combined with a stronger policy focus on the costs of doing business and
competitiveness issues.
3.
Presidential elections are planned for mid–2016. The constitution does not allow
President Sassou N’guesso to run for a third term. In May 2015, the government launched a
dialogue with political, civil society and religious leaders to discuss constitutional reform to
remove this obstacle. Opposition parties have announced a boycott of this process.

Policies have partially followed recent Article IV recommendations (Annex 1).
An expansionary supplementary budget was approved in September 2014 for increased
spending on the All Africa Games (AAG) that will be held in Brazzaville in 2015. In view of the oil
price decline, however, the 2015 budget envisaged some fiscal consolidation and the Cabinet
recently approved a supplementary budget with additional fiscal adjustment to fully take into
account the decline in oil prices. The authorities stopped short of adopting the recommended
medium-term fiscal framework, however, that targets a decline in the nonoil primary deficit. In
the context of the Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review
(PEMFAR), the authorities are reviewing, with development partners, the scope for improving the
efficiency and quality of public expenditures. Some of the government’s deposits in China have
been repatriated to the Bank of Central African States (BEAC), in line with regional reserves
pooling arrangements.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
5.
Growth rose to 6.8 percent in 2014, up from 3.3 percent the previous year, driven
by a rebound in oil production, and continued strong performance of the non-oil sector.
Non-oil growth was buoyed by strong growth in agriculture, construction, industry, and transport
and communication. Inflation decelerated from 2.1 percent at end–2013 to 0.5 percent at end2014 (year-on-year), driven mainly by lower global food prices.
6.
Nevertheless, the Republic of Congo has been hit hard by the oil price shock.
The sharp increase in government spending in recent years has supported growth, but it also
increased the country’s vulnerability to shocks. Fiscal and current account balances deteriorated
in 2014, reflecting increased government spending and the lower oil price.
7.
The overall fiscal deficit amounted to 8.5 percent of GDP in 2014, a near doubling
from 2013. This reflects continued strong capital spending and lower oil receipts. Despite a
3 percent increase in production, oil receipts declined by 5 percent of GDP in line with oil prices
and revisions to various profit sharing arrangements in July 2014.
8.
The basic non-oil primary deficit improved from over 74 percent to 72.1 percent of
non-oil GDP in 2014. This measure excludes oil receipts, grants, and foreign-financed capital
spending. The improvement was due to lower off-budget spending and payments of domestic
arrears:


Current expenditures were broadly in line with budgeted amounts, rising by 2.5 percent of
non-oil GDP compared to 2013.



Domestically-financed on-budget capital spending increased by 2.7 percent of non-oil GDP
as construction for the 2015 AAG and the urbanization program continued.



Non-oil revenues underperformed, falling by 0.5 percent of non-oil GDP compared to 2013,
largely owing to lower than expected customs revenues.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE REPUBLIC OF CONGO



Off-budget expenditures decreased by 3.2 percent of non-oil GDP.



Domestic arrears payments amounted to 1.5 percent of non-oil GDP in 2014, down by
4.9 percent of non-oil GDP from 2013.



Foreign-financed capital expenditures, which is not part of the basic non-oil primary balance,
decreased by 7.1 percentage points of non-oil GDP to 11.6 percent of non-oil GDP as only
about half of the budgeted amount was executed.

9.
In the wake of the decline in oil prices, the government repatriated offshore
deposits to finance the fiscal deficit and to bolster official reserves.


The fiscal deficit of 8.5 percent of
GDP was mainly financed by
drawing on government deposits
held abroad (2.1 percent of GDP)
and by borrowing from the
regional central bank (about
5.2 percent of GDP).1

government deposits held in China (CFAF 141 billion) and commercial banks’ deposits
held abroad (CFA 427 billion, see ¶11).2



As a consequence, the Republic of Congo’s international reserves and government
deposits at the regional central bank remain at about 9½ months of prospective imports
and 20 percent of GDP, respectively, both the highest among members of the Central
African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC).

1

The authorities chose to borrow from the central bank (avances statutaires) in order to preserve their deposits at
the BEAC which are mostly held in the Fund for Future Generations and for which penalties are incurred in the
event of unscheduled drawings.
2

In addition to their international reserves at the BEAC, the Republic of Congo’s holds offshore deposits in China.
These deposits are partly held to provide guarantees for long-term concessional infrastructure loans that make
up the bulk of Congo’s external debt.

The authorities are taking corrective fiscal measures. The 2015 budget is based on an
oil price assumption of $70 per barrel and implies some consolidation. However, in the first
quarter Congo received less than $50 per barrel from its oil exports. In response, only 30 percent
of monthly budget allocations for current expenditures were released, except for the wage bill
and the salary component of transfers which were executed in full. At the same time, the
implementation of lower-priority projects was slowed. In late-May, the Council of Ministers
adopted a supplementary budget based on an oil price of $55. Parliamentary approval is
pending.
11.
BEAC measures caused commercial banks’ net foreign assets (NFA) to decline.
The trend increase in banks’ NFA observed in recent years reversed in 2014 when the BEAC
moved in May and July 2014, facilitating and instructing banks to henceforth conduct foreign
exchange transactions directly with the regional central bank rather than building foreign
exchange balances abroad. As a result, banks reduced their NFA by CFAF 427 billion (6.4 percent
of GDP) during 2014, to CFAF 165.5 billion at end–2014.
12.
Despite rising credit growth, financial depth continues to lag peers. The growth of
credit to the economy accelerated to 27.6 percent in 2014, from 16½ percent in 2013.
Notwithstanding the recent acceleration of credit growth, the ratio of private credit to GDP
remains at 15 percent of GDP, well below the level in emerging market economies.
13.
Public debt now amounts to about 36½ percent of GDP, up from 32 percent of GDP
in 2013 and from 20 percent of GDP in 2010, following the HIPC Completion Point.
The increase in the government’s gross debt to GDP ratio in 2014 reflects continued borrowing,
the terms of trade loss from the sharp decline in oil prices (which reduced nominal GDP growth),
as well as valuation changes from the depreciation of the CFAF.
14.
Two of three ratings agencies maintained Congo’s strong sovereign rating.
S&P’s downgraded Congo’s rating from B+ to B, as part of a reassessment for all oil exporting
countries.
15.
Empirical approaches commonly used in the case of oil-exporting countries suggest
that Congo’s real effective exchange rate is in line with medium-term fundamentals, but
competitiveness concerns remain in the non-oil economy (Annex 2). The persistent large
non-oil current account deficits (26 percent of GDP in 2014) highlight competitiveness concerns
stemming from the challenging business climate and significant infrastructure gaps (Figures 2
and 3). Non-oil exports remained weak in 2014 despite the depreciation of the real effective
exchange rate by 2.6 percent in 2014. Congo remains in the lowest 10 percentile rank on the
World Bank’s overall ‘Ease of Doing Business’ score. Scores are particularly low for the ease of
obtaining credit and electricity, and the quality of the insolvency regime.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
16.
The near- and medium-term outlook will be shaped by developments in the oil
sector. Oil production is expected to decline in 2015 mainly due to the delay in the coming on
stream of a new oil field. GDP growth in 2015 is projected at 1 percent and to average about
3 percent per annum during 2015–20. The lower international oil price is projected to lead to
deterioration in the current account and continued pressure on the budget. This is expected to
require the drawdown of government deposits at the BEAC of 6.5 percent of GDP in 2015.
Over the period to 2018, the expected increase in oil production from new oil fields coming on
stream should improve fiscal and external balances. From 2018, this trend reverses as oil
production declines. Non-oil growth is projected to slow to about 3 percent in 2015–16, as public
investment spending contracts and mining projects are delayed due to the uncertain global
outlook for iron ore. Inflation is projected at 2½ percent over the medium term, underpinned by
the pegged exchange rate regime.
17.
The path and quality of fiscal adjustment will play a key role. In two alternative
scenarios, staff highlighted the implications of continued high government spending and
improving public sector investment efficiency, respectively, on the medium-term economic
outlook (Text Table):


In a “downside” scenario with continued high spending, fiscal adjustment would be
postponed by replacing declining oil revenues with external borrowing.
Higher government spending compared to the baseline would provide a short-term boost
to growth but increased inflation would erode competitiveness. Together with higher
imports, this would lead to deteriorations in the current account deficit over the period 2016
to 2018. Moreover, in view of the projected decline in oil production and receipts from 2018,
public debt would by 2019 exceed 60 percent of GDP, such that continued high spending
would need to be financed by drawing down reserves. This would eventually trigger the
need for a sharper fiscal adjustment in order to preserve reserves and buttress the exchange
rate peg. The result in the medium to long term would be lower growth and a permanently
deteriorated overall debt position.



An “upside policy scenario” illustrates the implications of improving public sector
investment efficiency. The increase in investment efficiency could be achieved by
implementing the PEFA and PEMFAR recommendations and enhanced coordination
between government agencies (see ¶30–31). In this scenario, increased investment efficiency
leads to higher growth in all years relative to the baseline. Although higher growth slightly
worsens the medium-term current account, owing to higher imports, in the medium term,
the overall fiscal balance and reserves are higher than in the baseline.

18.
Risks to the outlook are broadly balanced (Risk Assessment Matrix, Annex 3).
Global risks relate to a prolonged period of low oil prices. In the absence of a clearly articulated
medium-term fiscal consolidation plan, the accumulation of domestic expenditure arrears could
accelerate and risks to debt sustainability increase. This could significantly undermine the
resilience of the economy and the fiscal space that is essential to confront the challenges of
economic diversification and poverty reduction. It could also give rise to tensions and instability.
The upside risk to the baseline scenario relates to improvements in public sector investment
efficiency.
Authorities’ Views
19.
The authorities were more optimistic about non-oil growth. The authorities expect
non-oil growth in 2015 to be buoyed by continued strong growth in the agriculture and industry
sectors. The AAG are also expected to boost tourism, commerce, and services. The authorities
expected household consumption to remain robust, supported by rising public sector wages.
At the same time, they acknowledged that uncertainty from the oil price shock could impact
consumer and investor sentiment. The spillover effects to the rest of the economy from the
slowdown in spending in the construction sector are expected to be moderate, since large
building projects are mostly undertaken by foreign companies that rely heavily on imports.

20.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to prudent fiscal policy over the
medium term but noted the spending pressures related to the government’s diversification
plans. They were closely monitoring oil price developments and recognized the need for
improvements in the quality of government spending. The authorities emphasized that it is the
government’s role to make the necessary investments in basic infrastructure and in education
and health to facilitate growth and competitiveness and unlock private sector activity in non-oil
sectors. The Special Economic Zones (SEZ) policy is also expected to permit the private non-oil
sector to take off.3 Better roads will also help to establish Congo as a ‘transit country’ for cargo
unloaded in Point Noire to be shipped across the region. These investments are expected to
have significant returns in terms of boosting non-oil growth in the future.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Fiscal Policy: Developing the Non-Oil Economy to Protect the Poor
21.
Against the background of the limited remaining lifetime of oil reserves, the
decline in international oil prices makes the need for fiscal adjustment more urgent.
Staff reiterated earlier recommendations regarding fiscal adjustment to preserve medium-term
fiscal sustainability. At the same time there is a need to safeguard priority expenditures to
address social and infrastructure gaps. The supplementary 2014 budget, ratified in September,
deviated from a consolidation path consistent with fiscal sustainability. The supplementary
budget entailed a considerable increase in domestically-financed capital expenditures, mainly for
the AAG. Following the fall in oil prices, however, on-budget domestically-financed capital
spending was under-executed as the authorities prioritized AAG projects and the urbanization
program. Additional spending pressures emanate from elections in 2016 (presidential) and
2017 (legislative).
22.
The draft supplementary 2015 budget appropriately tightens the fiscal stance.
According to the authorities’ projections, the supplementary budget envisages a narrowing of
the non-oil primary fiscal deficit to about 42 percent of non-oil GDP from 81.2 percent of non-oil
GDP in 2014. Staff projects a smaller narrowing of the non-oil primary deficit to a deficit of
57 percent of non-oil GDP in 2015. The consolidation mostly reflects reductions in domesticallyfinanced investment spending. In addition to postponing non-priority projects and not initiating
new ones, this would entail partly reversing the doubling of on-budget current and capital
expenditures that took place over the past three years. This is expected to have a significant
negative impact on non-oil growth, which is projected to decline to 3.2 percent per annum in the
period 2015 to 2020, compared to almost 8 percent per annum in the five years preceding.
The focus of the adjustment on reductions in investment spending, which has a strong external
component, reduces import growth and therefore dampens the overall impact on growth.
In view of the projected reduction in expenditure, the authorities should strive to safeguard pro3

poor programs, improve investment efficiency to maximize the buildup of capital and safeguard
debt sustainability, and ensure that public financial management weaknesses do not generate
arrears. Non-oil tax revenue collection is expected to increase from new taxes introduced in
2015, including on mobile telephone operators, and further strengthening of customs
administration. Staff recommended that the Supplementary Budget clarify the basis for the
strong projected growth of non-oil revenues. Staff also emphasized the importance of preparing
contingency plans, given the fluid global situation, to manage downside risks should they
materialize. In this regard, staff welcomed the authorities’ intention to closely monitor budget
execution through comprehensive monthly fiscal reports.
23.
The authorities are likely to face important fiscal policy tradeoffs in the rest
of 2015. They should carefully weigh the trade-off between financing the projected fiscal deficit
from drawing down government deposits at the central bank (as currently assumed in the staff’s
baseline projections), additional fiscal adjustment, and additional borrowing from external or
domestic sources. In particular, it would be useful to analyze the nature and expected benefits of
discretionary spending and the comparative costs of alternative financing, including from using
the government’s fiscal buffers. Maintaining deposits at the regional central bank would provide
a buffer in the event of additional adverse shocks, including to oil prices, and would ensure the
continued smooth operation of the pegged exchange rate arrangement which has served Congo
well. External sustainability will require maintaining a level of reserves above five months of
imports to support the exchange rate peg. The decline in oil prices, and its impact on foreign
exchange reserves, reinforces the importance of compliance with existing regional reserve
pooling requirements.
24.
Over the medium-term, it will be important to develop a comprehensive and
coherent fiscal adjustment strategy. There are several aspects to this:


Strengthen fiscal reporting, including regarding the government’s overseas deposits and off
budget expenditures.4 In particular, the monthly preparation of the Table of Government
Financial Operations (TOFE) budget execution should include off-budget spending above the
line and financing from changes in offshore deposits below the line.5 Off budget spending
mainly comprises in-kind oil payments to finance a number of commercial agreements and
to cover losses incurred by the state oil refinery (CORAF) in maintaining regulated domestic
fuel prices. At a minimum, these amounts should be included as memorandum items in fiscal

4

The 2013 TOFE reports negative financing of CFAF 629 billion (9.4 percent of GDP) under “décalage techniques”
(statistical discrepancy). Based on discussions with the authorities in June 2014, the published 2014 IMF Article IV
consultation report noted that this large negative financing reflected a buildup of overseas deposits. However,
data newly made available to staff makes clear there was no such build up of offshore deposits. In fact, there was
a drawdown of deposits by about CFAF 59 billion during 2013. Outside the coverage of standard fiscal reporting,
the money was spent on a power plant built under the supervision of a foreign oil company.
5

Consideration could also be given to include subventions to the oil sector (to cover trading shortfalls owing to
the operation of administered retail prices for petroleum products) to the transfer expenditures line in the TOFE,
in line with the GFS 1986 Manual.

reporting. This is important to make a meaningful assessment of the stance of fiscal policy
and to derive a realistic fiscal consolidation path.


Adopt a multi-year perspective in fiscal planning. In this regard, staff recommended that
over the next five years, the non-oil primary deficit should be reduced to about
40 percent of non-oil GDP in order to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability (Annex IV).



Strengthen commitment control. This would help stem the accumulation of domestic
spending arrears and curtail increases in public debt that could significantly undermine
the resilience of the economy and fiscal policy space.



Enhance macroeconomic surveillance and coordination at the regional level. In view of the
significant and differential impact of the oil price decline in the CEMAC context, the
Republic of Congo could spearhead enhanced regional coordination in order to ensure
an appropriate policy mix in response to the shock.

25.
The impact of fiscal consolidation on longer-term growth and the poor should be
minimized. Specific measures could include:


Strengthen non-oil revenue collection. Consideration should be given to minimizing the use of
reduced VAT rates and tax exemptions, and strengthening the effectiveness of tax and
customs audits and inspections and bringing non-filers into the tax net.



Reprioritize capital spending, including off-budget capital spending. There is scope to
rationalize capital spending by prioritizing projects with clear impact on growth potential.
Recent work by the IMF6 to assess investment efficiency reveals an efficiency gap for Congo
which is significantly higher than the average for Low Income Developing Countries. This
suggests that there is scope for improved quality of investment. In particular, project
selection methods should be enhanced to boost the quality of public investment spending
and maximize the level of Congo’s long-run capital stock (Annex IV). This should also entail
adequate provisions for maintenance costs in budget planning. Also, any off-budget
investment spending should be consolidated under the budget process and hence be subject
to standardized procedures.



Rationalize subsidies that disproportionately benefit the people that least needs them. Energy
subsidies amounted to about 4 percent of non-oil GDP in 2014. With the fall in oil prices,
such subsidies have significantly declined to about ½ percent of GDP. Several countries
(e.g. Cameroon, Indonesia) have taken advantage of the current environment of low
international prices to phase out subsidies on petroleum products. Congo would benefit
from implementing similar steps. The prices of utilities should also be evaluated. Timing the
rollout of a program of energy subsidy reforms to coincide with the introduction of the pilot

cash transfer program could help to mitigate the social impact of the removal of energy
subsidies (SIP Chapter 2).


Consider options to control the growth of the government wage bill. A multi-year schedule of
civil servants’ wage increases was announced in 2013, when the outlook for international oil
prices was more favorable. The wage bill is forecast to peak at nearly 14 percent of non-oil
GDP in 2017, from less than percent 10 percent in 2013. Part of the upward pressure on the
wage bill is expected to emanate from the increase in hiring of qualified health care
professionals related to the countrywide medium-term hospital building program aimed at
re-balancing the significant geographical inequalities in health care provision. However,
increases in wage rates should be moderated.

26.
Adherence to a prudent borrowing policy is essential to avoid jeopardizing debt
sustainability. External debt has risen steadily in recent years and the authorities intend to
mobilize additional borrowing in addition to drawing down the country’s oil reserves.
Against this background, staff urged the authorities to pursue a prudent borrowing policy that
keeps the NPV of net debt below indicative Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) thresholds. As a
result of the decline in oil prices and the consequent drop in nominal GDP, the NPV of gross
external debt to GDP ratio temporarily breaches the 30 percent of GDP threshold in 2015 and
2016. Together with the sustained breaches in the standard stress tests, this would give rise to a
downgrade to a “high risk of debt distress.” However, an analysis based on net debt, which takes
into account Congo’s sizable government deposits at the BEAC, indicates that there are only
sustained breaches of the thresholds under the stress tests. On this basis, Congo is classified as
at “moderate risk of debt distress.” To the extent that new borrowing over the medium-term is
on less concessional terms than recent years, the risk of debt distress could rise.
27.
Staff encouraged the authorities to strengthen debt management and also take
into account the drawdown of oil wealth. As the authorities seek to broaden financing
sources, it would be important to develop a medium-term debt strategy (MTDS), strengthen
skills for evaluating financing offers, and to enhance transparency in debt and asset
management. As regards the option to issue government bonds in the local and regional
markets, staff recommended strengthening institutional and analytical capacities before
proceeding. This should include drawing up a strategy, in close collaboration with CEMAC
partners, to develop the regional government securities market and outlining in more detail the
financing requirements that would be covered by government securities and other sources, in
the MTDS.

Authorities’ Views
28.
The authorities had mixed views on staff’s recommendations. The authorities aimed
to fast track Parliamentary approval of the 2015 supplementary budget. They also highlighted
their intention to consider additional cuts in expenditure in the event of further revenue
shortfalls. The expenditures related to the AAG were the authorities’ main immediate priority.
The pace of other investment expenditures would be slowed and projects completed over a
longer period of time. The authorities would not consider making adjustments to the announced
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

THE REPUBLIC OF CONGO

multi-year increases in civil servants’ salaries because of their commitments to social partners.
They also argued that the rural poor would be hit hardest by the removal of energy subsidies
and would therefore maintain the current system of administered prices for petroleum products.
The authorities acknowledged that off-budget expenditures had caused discrepancies in the
fiscal accounts and agreed that, going forward, off-budget spending, including for energy
subsidies, should be consolidated in fiscal reporting.

B. Public Financial Management Reforms
29.
The PFM system faces a number of challenges in critical areas. Progress has been
made in recent years in refining the legislative framework for the budget, strengthening the
public procurement system, and in developing a medium-term budget framework. Significant
shortcomings remain, however, in adhering to budget allocations during execution. In addition,
the budget does not provide full coverage of government revenues and expenditures (see ¶24).
Shortcomings in commitment control are also evident, in particular for investment expenditures,
while there is also frequent recourse to in-year budget adjustments. These practices complicate
budget management and the timely and accurate reporting of expenditures. This is further
compounded by weaknesses in accounts preparation. A visible result of these shortcomings is
the persistence of domestic payment arrears at some 5.5 percent of GDP and there are risks from
further arrears being generated by the reduction in public spending.
30.
Since the adoption of the Organic Law in 2012, reforms have mainly focused on the
transposition of the six CEMAC PFM Directives. The government is taking important steps to
transpose the CEMAC PFM Directives through draft legislation on fiscal transparency, budget
classification, and the chart of accounts. The draft fiscal responsibility and transparency (FRT) law
would establish guiding principles for other PFM laws and includes provisions on natural
resources revenue transparency which would complement Congo’s compliant status under the
Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) since February 2013. This should be implemented
expeditiously and remain consistent with the relevant CEMAC directive. The authorities have also
made efforts to work on improving the expenditure management under the IT system (SIDERE),
and program budgeting is being developed. While the efforts to transpose the Directives are
welcome, implementation of PFM reforms is lagging in some critical areas. These are highlighted
in the recent PEFA assessment, which presents an opportunity to refocus reforms on these critical
shortcomings (Box 1). At the same time, reinvigorating the reform process will require a clearer
institutional framework and a review of the timeline of activities in order to ensure appropriate
sequencing.
31.
Staff encouraged implementation of measures to enhance the equity and efficiency
of government spending based on the findings of the PEMFAR. This includes:


18

Prioritizing the budgetary allocations to the agriculture and social sectors (health and
education) and building capacity of staff in these ministries in PFM issues whilst improving
monitoring and evaluation of projects to address low execution rates;

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE REPUBLIC OF CONGO



Improving the allocations of public resources, including by providing a geographic coverage
of the budget by regions or rural vs. urban areas;



Piloting, and eventually mainstreaming, a pro-poor cash transfer program that is welltargeted and adequately monitored;



Improving access to health care, for example by waiving user fees for the poor and
compensating providers as part of the government’s universal health care coverage, to be
rolled out over the medium term; and



Prioritizing infrastructure spending with a stronger growth and human development impact.

Box 1: Public Expenditure and Accountability Framework Assessment and
Recommendations
A follow up to the initial 2006 assessment under the PEFA was undertaken in 2014. The PEFA
recognizes progress made since the earlier assessment in introducing a medium-term budgetary framework,
reforms to the procurement system and the clearer legal underpinnings provided by the 2012 budget
framework law. At the same time, the assessment finds continued important scope to strengthen the
credibility of budget allocations; the scope and coverage of budget documents; timeliness and accuracy of
accounting data; internal control and transparency. In addition, a critical cross-cutting issue that hampers
progress across the cycle of budgetary operations is the performance of the various IT systems underpinning
the PFM system.
Against this background, staff recommended that an updated reform plan should contain the
following critical elements:

Broadening the scope of budget documentation and fiscal reporting and consolidating off-budget
spending;

Ensuring reliable forecasts of fiscal aggregates and strengthening commitment controls and
procedures to help prevent further accumulation of arrears;


Tightening procedures for in-year budget adjustments;


Taking a multi-year perspective in fiscal planning, in particular for commitments on investment
projects;


Reinforcing the link between the National Development Plan (NDP) and budgetary allocations; and


Rationalizing IT systems to ensure full coverage and inter-operability between key departments and
modules.

Authorities’ Views
32.
The authorities gave high priority to PFM reforms and considered that their focus
on the overarching legal framework, as set out in the CEMAC Directives, was appropriate.
In particular, they noted their intention to move ahead with the FRT law before the end of the
year. The authorities emphasized that ongoing projects were not being cancelled and only
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

THE REPUBLIC OF CONGO

postponed. For this reason, the costs of the projects should not increase and arrears should not
accumulate. The authorities consider that the problem of payment arrears may be overstated,
depending on the accounting conventions used for their recording, as their definition of arrears
differs from that of private sector companies. The authorities nevertheless broadly agree that a
more comprehensive presentation of government fiscal operations is appropriate, and indicated
their willingness to further engage with IMF staff on how to move ahead with this. The question
of providing geographical information on budget allocations, meanwhile, was something that the
authorities considered to be best addressed in the context of their ongoing efforts to move
towards a program budgeting approach to budget preparation.
33.
With regard to public investment efficiency, the authorities indicated that they
intended to give higher priority to quality concerns in the public investment program.
In terms of sectoral priorities, however, they considered that agriculture allocations were
appropriate and that a range of flanking policies in rural areas (health, electricity, water,
transportation, etc.) were equally important for developing agricultural potential. With regard to
the proposed cash transfer program, in the second half of 2015 the authorities plan to roll out
the Lisungi project, with World Bank support, across a number of pilot districts.

C. Promoting Financial Sector Development and Inclusion
34.
An analysis of macro-financial linkages suggests that the decline in oil prices may
have important spillover effects to the financial sector. Banks’ compliance with CEMAC
prudential ratios remains, on average, broadly adequate. Three (out of the 10) banks do not
maintain capital above the COBAC CFAF 10 billion minimum. Two of these have drawn up timebound recapitalization plan. The third bank may be turned into an SME bank with the
government taking a share in it. The non-performing loan (NPL) ratio more than doubled, albeit
from low levels, to 2.5 percent in 2014. The stress tests in the January 2015 FSAP highlight that
Congolese banks would be most vulnerable to a re-classification of performing loans to NPLs.
In light of this, anecdotal reports of a buildup of government arrears to domestic private sector
operators underscore the risk that the large decline in oil revenues and the resulting need to
reduce government spending could lead to a further increase in NPLs.
35.
Increased financial access and intermediation could have important economic
benefits. The Republic of Congo’s financial sector is shallow, highly concentrated, and
characterized by limited inclusiveness (SIP chapter 3). Staff’s analysis suggests that increasing
access to bank lending and other financial services, increasing the quality of loan collateral and
lowering bank intermediation costs could have an important impact on growth, productivity, and
inequality. In light of this, staff advised to (i) accelerate the implementation of a centralized
balance sheet bureau to strengthen the quality of accounting data; (ii) strengthen the credit
registry; (iii) establish a property registry and a unique window to register land titles;
(iv) strengthen the judicial framework by boosting the judges’ and tribunals’ capacity to address
financial sector issues. In addition, there is scope to encourage microfinance and mobile banking
by fostering collaboration between commercial banks, microfinance institutions and
telecommunication companies and move forward with the ongoing implementation of the
20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE REPUBLIC OF CONGO

electronic payment system for taxes and utilities and developing the bank branches network.
The authorities are encouraged to work in close collaboration with COBAC and BEAC on financial
innovations to ensure consistency with regional regulations. Staff encouraged the authorities to
put in place a strategy to develop the financial sector that includes a roadmap of prioritized
time-bound actions, involves all the relevant stakeholders, and whose implementation is
proactively monitored.
36.
AML/CFT. Staff encouraged the authorities to move forward with ensuring financial
sector compliance with customer due diligence (CDD) and operationalizing the recently created
financial intelligence unit (ANIF-Congo) and ensuring that it has an adequate budget that will
allow it to immediately undertake its core functions independently.

Authorities’ Views
37.
The authorities highlighted that the FSAP findings showed that the Congolese
banks were the most resilient to shocks among the banks in the CEMAC region.
They recognized the importance of encouraging financial sector development in order to
promote the diversification of the economy. The authorities acknowledged that the successful
development of the sector requires reforms of the legal system to facilitate use of collateral.
They considered that progress has been made in requiring civil servants to receive salaries
through bank accounts and the development of mobile banking. More generally, the authorities
are in the process of reviewing and updating their 2006 financial sector development strategy
which would also ensure that national measures are fully integrated with regional objectives in
the CEMAC context.

D. Other Surveillance Issues
38.
The quality and timeliness of macroeconomic data needs to be improved.
This would benefit the implementation of the Republic of Congo’s important agenda of
macroeconomic and structural reforms, as well as ensure compliance with data provision
obligations under Article VIII (e.g. in relation to IIP data, off-budget spending, and deposits held
abroad). In this regard, staff encouraged the authorities to operationalize the National Strategy
for Statistics Development (NSSD) to address data issues and technical capacity constraints over
the coming years. Staff also underscored the need to ensure adequate funding to the statistics
agency and emphasized the need to clarify which agency is in charge of compiling and providing
national accounts and debt data and to make sure that all government agencies unify their data
in a coherent manner.
39.
The authorities are encouraged to improve policy coordination and monitoring.
This would be instrumental in ameliorating the efficiency and effectiveness of macroeconomic
and structural reform policies. For instance, the PEMFAR highlights that the planning, budgeting,
and implementation of public investment would benefit from enhanced coordination between all
institutions relevant to public investment spending. At the same time, the impending need to
renew the 2012–16 NDP in 2016 presents an opportunity to more firmly embed Congo’s

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

THE REPUBLIC OF CONGO

development objectives in the context of further regional integration, including transportation
infrastructure.

Authorities‘ View
40.
The authorities noted that the implementation of the NSSD is underway.
They recognized the assistance from development partners (the World Bank, AFRISTAT, IMF) and
indicated that the aim is for all official statistics to be unified and to eventually have the National
Institute of Statistics be the single entity responsible for disseminating statistics.
41.
The NDP provides the overall strategic vision within which public investment
expenditures are made. Building on an evaluation of the second period of the NDP, the
authorities will prepare a new development plan which will encompass the post 2015 Millennium
Development Goals agenda and the objectives of the continent.

STAFF APPRAISAL
42.
Growth was strong and inflation moderated in 2014. Growth rose to 6.8 percent in
2014, driven by a rebound in oil production. Inflation eased to 0.5 percent at end–2014 (year-onyear), driven mainly by lower global food prices.
43.
But Congo has been hit hard by the oil price shock. The fiscal deficit amounted to
8.5 percent of GDP in 2014, a near doubling from 2013, owing mostly to increased spending and
the lower oil receipts. The current account balance also deteriorated.
44.
The economy is projected to expand by about 3 percent per annum during 2015–20
as new oil fields come on stream. Though necessary, the fiscal consolidation implied by the
supplementary budget is expected to result in growth slowing to 1 percent in 2015. Risks to the
outlook relate to oil price volatility, persistently low oil prices, accumulation of domestic payment
arrears, and domestic instability. While Congo’s real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with
macroeconomic fundamentals, the performance of non-oil exports is weak and points to
competitiveness concerns.
45.
The 2015 supplementary budget should be passed swiftly and its implementation
monitored closely. The authorities should weigh carefully their response to revenue shortfalls and
expenditure overruns. Maintaining deposits at the regional central bank would provide a buffer in
the event of additional adverse shocks. Contingency plans should be prepared to address
downside risks.
46.
Safeguarding fiscal and debt sustainability will require a coherent medium-term
fiscal adjustment strategy. In view of the limited remaining lifetime of oil reserves, and
continued low prices, fiscal policy should be anchored on a gradual multi-year reduction in the
non-oil primary deficit. The rise in government debt since the 2010 HIPC/MDRI relief in addition
to the drawdown of oil reserves, underscores the importance of continued adherence to a
prudent borrowing policy that keeps the NPV of net debt below indicative DSA thresholds.
22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE REPUBLIC OF CONGO

This should also be coordinated within the context of a revised CEMAC macroeconomic
surveillance framework (See CEMAC Staff Report).
47.
Public expenditure should increasingly be oriented towards policies to support
inclusive growth and pro-poor programs. The link between the actions in the NDP and the
annual budgets should be clearly established during budget preparation, with a stronger focus
on economic diversification. The selection, evaluation, and monitoring of investment projects, as
well as the budgeting of their operating and maintenance costs, need to be strengthened. More
broadly, the authorities are encouraged to follow up on the recommendations from the PEFA
and PEMFAR to strengthen budget execution, procurement and disbursement processes and
improve the efficiency and quality of spending.
48.
Fiscal adjustment should be underpinned by improved revenue policies and PFM
reforms. There is scope to boost non-oil revenues by limiting the use of reduced VAT rates and
tax exemptions whilst reinforcing tax and customs administration. PFM reforms should focus on
improving the quality of investment, resolving the accumulation of arrears, and ensuring
comprehensive fiscal reporting that consolidates off-budget spending, possibly with IMF
technical assistance.
49.
Financial sector reforms are essential to underpin growth, diversification and reduce
inequality. The financial sector should benefit from the authorities’ plans to revise its strategy in this
sector with a view to covering recent innovations and consistency with regional objectives. Key
priorities remain the improvement of the credit registry, establishing a property registry and a unique
window to register land titles, and strengthening the judicial framework. Promoting broader usage of
microfinance and mobile banking should also enhance financial access.
50.
External sustainability should aim at maintaining a level of reserves above five
months of imports to support the exchange rate peg. The decline in oil prices, and its impact
on foreign exchange reserves, reinforces the importance of compliance with CEMAC reserves
pooling requirements to underpin the pegged exchange rate arrangement. In this regard, staff
welcomes the repatriation of part of Congo’s overseas deposits and recommends a continuation
of this policy.
51.
The quality and timeliness of macroeconomic statistics needs urgent strengthening,
to help improve macroeconomic analysis and policymaking and ensure compliance with
obligations under Article VIII. Progress needs to be made in improving capacity and
operationalizing the NSSD. In particular, macroeconomic statistics should be unified across
government agencies and the national statistics agency should have adequate funding.
52.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12–month cycle.

Annex I. Authorities’ Implementation of 2014 Policy
Recommendations

Anchor

Fiscal Policy

2014 Article IV Recommendations
mplement a fiscal anchor based on a
reduction of the non-oil primary deficit over
time in order to ensure fiscal and debt
sustainability and the accumulation of
sufficient wealth buffers for the post –
hydrocarbon future.

Management

Public financial

Improve non-oil revenue collection
Bolster transparency and strengthen
accountability of Public Financial
Management in line with regional
guidelines.
Improve budget execution and
procurement / disbursement processes.

Fiscal Expenditures

Address social and economic
infrastructure gaps by boosting the quality
of public investment spending.
Expansion of ongoing employment and
social safety net programs.

Authorities’ Implementation
The 2014 Supplementary budget deviated from the recommended
fiscal consolidation path. The 2015 Budget and 2015 Supplementary
budget have put fiscal policy on a consolidation path. However, the
authorities have stopped short of adopting a fiscal anchor based on a
reduction of the non-oil primary deficit over time.
The tax base for the VAT has been broadened, including the
introduction of a tax on mobile telephone operators in 2015.
The authorities have prepared a draft fiscal responsibility and
transparency law that will implement some of the Economic and
Monetary Community of Central African States (CEMAC) directives on
public financial management, and would improve budget accounting,
preparation, and execution. The draft law awaits ratification by the
Council of Ministers.
Progress is being made in discussions with staff on making fiscal
reporting more comprehensive by including financing flows from
overseas government deposits and off-budget spending
Efficiency and quality of public expenditures remains poor, as
suggested by frequent power outages and poor road conditions.
Efforts to improve the selection, evaluation, and monitoring of
investment projects as well as the budgeting of their operating and
maintenance costs need to be strengthened.
A food security safety net has been implemented
A national institute for professional training related to
implementation of social protection programs has been established.
Employment programs to develop skills to meet private sector needs
continue. Infrastructure in the education sector has been upgraded.
The pilot program of targeted cash transfers was officially launched
in 2014, and implementation continues.

Strengthen the business climate.

Regional

32

The authorities have taken steps to strengthen the business climate.
Paying taxes has been made easier for companies by reducing the
corporate income tax rate and abolishing the tax on the rental value of
business premises and on company-owned cars. Minority investor
protections have been improved by enhancing company disclosure
and transparency requirements. These measures have been reflected in
the 2015 World Bank ‘Doing Business’ survey. However, Congo’s
business climate remains among the most challenging in the world.

Coordination

Market depth, financial intermediation and access to finance
continue to lag.

Cooperation

Policy

Business Climate

Remove barriers to the effective
provision of financial services to foster
private sector development and inclusive
growth.

Enhance policy coordination and
monitoring
Improve data strength and timeliness

Lack of coordination between government agencies continues to
hamper the efficiency and effectiveness of macroeconomic and
structural reform policies.
Improving the quality and timeliness of data remains urgent.

Observance of CEMAC obligations,
especially as regards to reserves repatriation
and pooling requirements.

The authorities repatriated a portion of their Chinese deposits in
2014 and in the first few months of 2015.

Annex II. External Sector Assessment
Republic of Congo’s real effective exchange rate depreciated slightly in 2014. Commonly-used
empirical approaches to assess the level of the exchange rate for an oil-exporting country which
take into account that Congo derives around 80 percent of its export revenues from the
hydrocarbon sector and also has significant investment needs, suggest that the Republic of Congo’s
real effective exchange rate (REER) is broadly in line with medium term fundamentals. However,
competitiveness concerns remain, as Congo’s business climate remains among the most
challenging in the world.
1.
The decline in international oil prices in 2014 was accompanied by a slight
depreciation of Congo’s real effective exchange rate. In Congo, the decline in the terms of
trade associated with the oil price shock was accompanied by a decline in the real effective
exchange rate. This contrasted with a REER appreciation in other CEMAC oil-exporting countries
(Figure 1). The REER depreciated by 2.6 percent during 2014 as the nominal effective exchange
rate depreciated by 3.5 percent over the same period.

2.
Despite the decline in the real effective exchange rate, the performance of Congo’s
non–oil exports continues to be weak relative to those of SSA Frontier Markets (Figure 2).
Congo’s non–oil exports lifted a little in 2014, and lie above the regional average. However, they
still lie well below the SSA Frontier Market average, countries which on average experienced a
similar depreciation of their exchange rate in 2014.
3.
An application of the Araujo et al. (2013) methodology suggests that the exchange
rate is broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals (Table 1). This approach utilizes a
dynamic general equilibrium model to calculate the medium-term current account norm. It is
based on an inter-temporal optimization problem that takes into account not only consumption
smoothing motives, but also the optimal investment needs of a developing country such as
Congo. The current account norm estimated by the model takes into account absorptive capacity
constraints associated with investment, reflecting the fact that ambitious public and private
investment programs in developing countries are often plagued by poor planning and poor
coordination which associated to weak oversight contribute to large cost overruns. Results from
this methodology suggest that the exchange rate is broadly in equilibrium under cost overrun
assumptions of 15 and 30 percent. Higher cost overruns lead to relatively higher investment
needs to cover for the larger inefficiencies, which in turn imply a higher current account balance
norm.

4.
The approach of Bems and Carvalho (2009) does not take into account existing
investment needs and shows a slight overvaluation of the real exchange rate of 5 percent
in the medium term. This methodology abstracts from existing investment needs and calculates
the path of the current account norm based on inter-temporal allocation rules for oil income
flows. The implied paths for the current account are always above the projections for Congo,
since the methodology does not take into account the effects of public investment on future
productivity growth. Therefore, in the context of Congo’s ambitious public investment program,
the results of the Araujo et al. (2013) model would be more suitable for assessing potential
medium–term real exchange rate misalignments.
5.
While the statistical analysis does not show signs of a significant overvaluation, the
stubborn poverty and continuous weak performance of exports in the non–oil economy
are indicative of significant competitiveness concerns. Congo’s non–oil current account
deficit stood at 29.4 percent of GDP in 2014, in part reflecting considerable obstacles from a
challenging competitive business environment, especially in comparison to regional and global
peers (Figure 2, main text). Congo ranks 178th out of 189 countries in the World Bank’s 2015
‘Doing Business’ ranking. Congo improved its overall ‘Doing Business’ ranking by 1 place
compared to that of 2014, largely due to the streamlining of procedures to start businesses and
improvements in protection for minority investors.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most
likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks
surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability
between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on
the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually
exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Annex IV. Fiscal Sustainability—The Impact of Lower Oil Prices
The 2014 Article IV consultation recommended the adoption of the Non–Resource Primary Balance
(NRPB) as the anchor for a sustainable fiscal policy for the Republic of Congo. A sustainable fiscal policy
path for the Republic of Congo would imply a declining path of the Non-Resource Primary Deficit
(NRPD). This would permit the authorities to undertake their ambitious investment program, aimed at
diversifying the economy, while at the same time building up wealth in preparation for the exhaustion of
oil reserves in the medium term. The recent decline in oil prices has however substantially affected the
value of Congo’s oil endowment, while government spending remained elevated. This annex derives an
expenditure path that is consistent with fiscal sustainability at the current lower WEO oil price baseline.
Provided that the efficiency of government investment rises substantially, this expenditure path could still
be consistent with building a capital stock commensurate with that of emerging market countries.
However, Congo’s financial buffers in the long run would be negative.

A.

Background

1.
The 2014 Article IV consultation for the Republic of Congo recommended the adoption
of the Non–Resource Primary Deficit (NRPD) as the primary anchor of fiscal policy. In view of the
relatively short remaining lifetime of Congo’s oil endowment, targeting a declining path of the NRPD
over time would also allow Congo to set out a more realistic timescale for its ambitious public
investment program, while at the same stabilizing the country’s net financial assets to prepare for the
time when oil resources are exhausted.1
2.
In the meantime however, the price of oil has declined sharply and is likely to remain
relatively low in the immediate future. The near halving of international oil prices since
October 2014 has caused fiscal oil receipts to plummet, from 82.1 percent of non–oil GDP in 2013 to
an estimated 64.7 percent of non–oil GDP in 2014. This oil price decline has also affected the value of
Congo’s natural resource endowment into the future.
3.
Despite the squeeze on oil revenues, government expenditures in Congo remain
elevated. The Republic of Congo faces continued spending pressures. Large capital spending
commitments, for example those associated with the hosting of the All Africa Games in September
2015, are inelastic. The forthcoming 2016 presidential and 2017 legislative elections are also placing
significant pressure on current spending.
4.
This note examines the implications of the recent oil price decline for fiscal sustainability
in the Republic of Congo. Government expenditures must be put on a sustainable path, while at the
same time allowing the authorities to pursue their ambitious infrastructure program aimed at
diversifying the economy and preparing for the post–
hydrocarbon era. These considerations must however take into account that the value of Congo’s oil

The authorities’ projections imply that production will fall from a peak of about 128 million barrels in 2018 to about
12 million barrels in 2034. According to BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2014, the proven reserves to production
ratio is 15.6 years.

The Impact of Lower Oil Prices

5.
The recent decline in oil prices has substantially affected Congo’s near term oil receipts
(Figure 1). Plummeting oil prices have led to a commensurate decline in projected government oil
receipts over 2015–2016. As a percentage of GDP, projected oil receipts in the medium term are
currently lower than in the 2014 Article IV consultation, with the exception of the period 2018–2020.
Production forecasts for this period have in the meantime been revised upwards significantly, due to
the coming on stream of a major new oil field.
6.
The decline in oil receipts is a major factor behind the lower level of total wealth and
net financial assets over the forecast horizon. Due largely to the oil shock, Congo starts with an
initial lower value of wealth. The decline in oil receipts, combined with the rapid accumulation of
external debt over recent years, and large fiscal deficits in 2013 and 2014 also implies that Congo
finds itself initially in a net liability position.
7.
Total wealth is drawn down rapidly over time. Total financial wealth is composed of the net
financial asset position,1 plus natural resource wealth in each year. Natural resource wealth is defined
as the discounted sum of the stream of future oil revenues.2 Hence Congo’s wealth position is not
only affected by the shock to oil revenues, but it is also drawn down rapidly in order to finance an
elevated level of expenditures.
8.
As a result, Congo is unable to build up wealth buffers in the long run. Congo begins as a
net debtor (negative net financial assets), as the elevated levels of debt exceed assets. Wealth is
drawn down over time, associated with continued high government spending and lower future oil
revenues. Even as the non-oil primary deficit reduces over time, the legacy of high government
expenditures is projected to leave Congo as a long run net debtor, with a net financial asset position
in the order of –20.3 percent of GDP in 2034. As future oil revenues dissipate, long run total wealth
will be negative.

1

The initial net financial asset position at end 2014 is defined as the difference between government deposits at the
BEAC and abroad and external and domestic debt. Thereafter, the net financial asset position grows by the factor
(1+r/1+g), where g is the nominal growth rate of non-oil GDP and r is the interest rate. This is known as the ‘automatic
dynamics’ of the net financial asset position. The interest rate is fixed at 6.5 percent, while growth varies endogenously
according to the macro framework. For 2015 onwards, net financial assets is then the sum of these ‘automatic
dynamics’, plus present year oil revenues, and the non–oil primary balance.
2

Future oil revenues are discounted by product of the factor (1+g)/r. For example, to discount 2018 oil revenues back
to end 2014, multiply oil revenues in 2018 by the product of (1+g)/r for 2015–18.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 41

THE REPUBLIC OF CONGO

9.
As a result of elevated expenditures and the drawdown in wealth, Congo is projected to
build up a public capital stock well above that of the middle income country average.3
Assuming a high efficiency of public infrastructure investment expenditures, the fiscal consolidation
path permits the accumulation of an unadjusted capital stock in the order of 194 percent of GDP in
2034. This level lies well above the average for middle income countries4. The elevated level of the
public capital stock comes at the cost of completely eroding Congo’s financial buffers, with no wealth
reserves left for future generations.
10.
Potential inefficiencies in the public investment process and weak public financial
management processes would imply a lower effective level of the public capital stock. The gap
between the two estimated capital stocks under different assumptions on investment efficiency
highlights the need for Congo to improve their PFM systems, in order to improve the quality of
investment expenditures, maximize their return on public investment and the level of the public
capital stock.
11.
The decline in natural resource wealth makes it urgent to address both the level and
quality of public expenditures. To prevent the rapid drawdown of total financial wealth and the
complete erosion of future financial wealth, Congo needs to address the level of public expenditures
as a matter of priority. For example, non priority expenditures and expenditures on investment
projects with limited value-added in terms of economic development could be cancelled.
Furthermore, maximizing the quality of expenditures would help boost the long run level of the
capital stock. Swift implementation of reforms to public financial management practices and the
enhancement of investment project selection methods are essential for boosting the quality of public
investment spending and maximizing the level of Congo’s long-run public capital stock.
12.
Preliminary analysis using a ‘balance sheet’ approach to public sector assets and
liabilities highlights importance of increasing the quality of public expenditures in the medium
term. The bulk of Congo’s net worth is composed of the proven value of oil reserves. A high level of
public investment quality would be important to maximize the level of the public capital stock and
hence increase growth. This would help shield the public sector balance sheet from downside risks to
the oil price outlook, as well as the projected decline in the value of proven oil reserves at present that
is implied by current resource extraction rates.5

3

The public capital stock is calculated using the methodology followed by the literature, e.g. Gupta et al. (2014) and
Kamps (2006), as follows. The public capital stock is constructed using the perpetual inventory equation,
, where
is the stock of public capital at time t; is a time – varying depreciation rate;
is public investment spending at time t-1, assuming that new investment is operational in the middle of the period;
and is a time invariant efficiency adjustor. The calculation of the unadjusted public capital stock (which corresponds
to a ‘high efficiency’ of public investment) assumes that this term is equal to 1. The calculation of the ‘efficiency
adjusted’ capital stock assumes that this term is equal to 0.5 (which corresponds to a ‘low efficiency’ of public
investment). The latter calculation takes into account that public investment is unlikely to translate fully into productive
capital assets under weak institutional frameworks. Data on public investment and GDP are expressed in constant 2005
prices using investment and GDP deflators respectively.
4

This elevated projected level of the public capital stock is a preliminary analysis and warrants further investigation.

5

Proven oil reserves are calculated as the sum of the value of future oil production implied by the authorities’
production projections. To derive the value of oil output in any given year, the projected production is multiplied by
the Congolese oil export price and converted into CFA Francs.

/1 Domestic debt consists principally of the stock of arrears.
/2 Net worth is defined as total assets (the sum of domestic and foreign deposits, oil reserves, the public capital stock and bilateral loans) minus
total liabilities (the sum of domestic and external debt)
/3 Wealth is defined as the sum of net financial assets and the present discounted value of future oil receipts. In 2014, net financial assets
corresponds to the difference between government deposits at the BEAC and abroad and external and domestic debt. See footnote one of the text

The MDRI provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries that qualified for the assistance. Grant
assistance from the MDRI Trust and HIPC resources provide debt relief to cover the full stock of debt owed to the
Fund as of end-2004 that remains outstanding at the time the member qualifies for such debt relief.

Implementation of Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief (PCDR): Not Applicable
Decision point - point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country qualifies for
assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of assistance to be committed.
Interim assistance - amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and completion
points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance committed at the decision point (or
25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional circumstances).
Completion point - point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its assistance committed at
the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income as defined in footnote 2
above. The timing of the completion point is linked to the implementation of pre-agreed key structural
reforms (i.e., floating completion point).

Safeguards Assessment:
The Bank of the Central African States (BEAC) is the regional central bank of the Central
African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC). As with other regional central banks, the
BEAC is subject to a safeguards assessment every four years. The quadrennial assessment in 2013
occurred against the backdrop of significant change at the BEAC to address governance challenges
and control failures that emerged in 2009 and led to close engagement in the period after through
close IMF monitoring of safeguards “rolling measures.” The BEAC also embarked on a reform and
modernization plan (RMP) to strengthen controls. The 2013 assessment concluded that despite some
progress made by the BEAC in reinforcing its safeguards framework, further actions were needed to
fully restore sound governance and control, including through amendments to the BEAC charter and
commitment to achieve the RMP. The assessment also recommended maintaining the annual
monitoring visits to the BEAC to follow up on progress on implementing the safeguards rolling
measures and advancing work on the BEAC’s own reform plan in the context of new program
requests and reviews to CEMAC countries. Consistent with this close engagement, a safeguards staff
visit to the BEAC was conducted in April 2015. Staff concluded that while the BEAC continues the
implementation of its reform plan, slippages have occurred and the timeframe of the RMP has been
revised. Progress on implementing the safeguards rolling measures has been mixed, and priority
recommendations on amendments to the BEAC charter and adoption of an internationally
recognized financial reporting framework (IFRS) are delayed. The BEAC has requested IMF technical
assistance to advance the implementation of the above recommendations, and steps for the prompt
delivery of these actions have been initiated. Strong actions and close coordination with member
states to gain consensus will be needed in the period ahead for the BEAC to conclude its reforms and
the outstanding safeguards recommendations. Progress on implementation of the latter will remain
subject to monitoring by the IMF, as a condition to continuing new program requests and reviews for
CEMAC member countries.

B. Nonfinancial Relations
Exchange System:
The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangement of the Central African Monetary Union (CAMU)
is a conventional peg. Congo has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4 and
maintains no separate legal tender. The regional currency is the CFA franc, which is pegged to the
Euro at a fixed rate of CFAF 655.95 =Euro 1. Congo does not impose any restrictions on the making
of payments and transfers for current international transactions.

Article IV consultations:
Consultations with Congo are now on a 12-month cycle, based on the Board decision on Article IV
consultation cycles. The last Article IV consultation discussions were held in Brazzaville on May 13 –
26, 2014. The consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on July 21, 2014 when the staff
report (Country Report No. 14/272 at www.imf.org) was discussed.

WORLD BANK WORLD—JOINT ACTION PLAN
The IMF and the World Bank teams maintain an ongoing exchange of views on relevant
macroeconomic and structural issues in the Republic of Congo. Cooperation during the last year has
included discussions related to the macroeconomic situation in Republic of Congo; the ongoing
Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR); progress in the
achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG); and updates on the status of World Bank
country programs. These World Bank country programs are aimed at improving competitiveness and
development outcomes and include a conditional cash transfer program and measures to improve
rural area productivity through investment in roads, programs to develop seeds and the training of
farmers. A full DSA is jointly prepared by the two teams for the 2015 Article IV consultations; a DSA—
full or update—will also be conducted in 2016.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of June 9, 2015)
A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, but there are some key data
shortcomings in national accounts, monetary, fiscal, and external sector statistics due to capacity
constraints.
National Accounts: National accounts data is weak, with inconsistencies both internally and with
balance of payments statistics. The National Statistics Institute (NSI) of the Ministry of Finance (MoF)
provides Fund missions with a breakdown of GDP by expenditures and sectors, both in nominal and
real terms. In the context of moving to the SNA93 system of accounts, the NSI completed the
national accounts estimates for 2005 (the new base year) and for 2006–08, with the assistance of
AFRITAC Central. The authorities are currently working with the AFRITAC Central to revise national
accounts’ estimates up to 2012. A system of provisional accounts is also being implemented, and will
provide estimates for the most recent years. Annual data on employment in the central government
are available from the MoF. As part of the structural reforms undertaken in the context of the postconflict program, the government completed an audit of public service employees. Both the
Directorate General of the Economy and NSI produce data on the national accounts outturn for any
given year, and coordination between the institutions is weak. Going forward, the NSI will be the sole
source of national accounts data.
Price Statistics: Movements in the prices of commodities consumed by households are recorded for
the capital city of Brazzaville and for Pointe Noire, the center of economic activities. For some
functions, indices and price movements are significantly different between the two cities. Data are
compiled on a monthly basis. Since August 2010, the authorities introduced a new CPI measure with
new weights and a new composition of the basket of goods and services. This new CPI is harmonized
with that of other countries in the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC).
Government Finance Statistics: Although the Ministry of Economy, Finance, Planning, Public
Investment, and Integration (MEFPPI) produces GFS data, data is submitted to the IMF statistical
department with substantial delays and is limited to budgetary central government above-andbelow the line transactions. Debt data are available from Caisse Congolaise d’Amortissement (CCA)
sources, but are not integrated in GFS reporting, although provided to Fund missions. The debt data
contain significant inconsistencies between the outstanding stock of debt and future debt service
payments. Furthermore, fiscal financing transactions are incomplete leading to statistical
discrepancies. On the ground collection of data related to local government units is good. However,
there is a lack of consistency / transparency between above the line and below the line transactions,
particularly as relates to oil revenues. There are also inconsistencies and lags related to consolidation
and intra – governmental transfers. A more comprehensive financial balance sheet could be
produced to fully capture the public sector assets / liability position. Concerns still exist with regard
to the reconciliation of fiscal and monetary statistics. There is no centralized, comprehensive
database on the operations of public enterprises. Recent technical assistance missions have been
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

REPUBLIC OF CONGO

fielded to address issues of timeliness and comprehensiveness. The authorities have expressed an
intention to expand GFS reporting to include extra budgetary units, social security funds and local
government and improve timeliness. However, significant effort is required to produce
comprehensive GFS on a timely basis. The compilation of GFS statistics to be reported to the Fund
should be carried out in close cooperation with the division in charge of statistics on financial
operations of the government. However, there are significant inconsistencies between the
outstanding stock of debt and future debt service payments. Moreover, the debt stock data cannot
readily be reconciled with flow data in the fiscal accounts. The CCA also produces domestic debt
data. Concerns still exist with regard to the reconciliation of fiscal and monetary statistics. There is no
centralized, comprehensive database on the operations of public enterprises. The Republic of Congo
reported (in September 2008) GFS data to STA for fiscal years 2004 and 2005 using the GFSM 2001
template—data for 2006–10 has experienced delays. High-frequency fiscal data has not yet been
reported for publication in IFS. The compilation of GFS statistics to be reported to the Fund should
be carried out in close cooperation with the division in charge of statistics on financial operations of
the government.
Monetary Statistics: Monetary statistics are reported to the Fund by the Banque des États de
l’Afrique Centrale (BEAC) on a monthly basis in the format of the standardized report forms (SRFs).
The depository corporation survey does not include data from deposit taking microfinance
institutions, a growing sector in the country. There is however a significant time lag in the reporting
of these statistics to Fund missions. It is hoped to include data in the future on interest rates offered
by the financial institutions sector to non-financial entities on deposits and loans.
Financial sector surveillance: Republic of Congo report to STA all core and some encouraged
financial soundness indicators.
Balance of payments: Although BEAC produces balance of payments data; there is substantial delay
in data submission to STA. The recent BOP mission of February 2015 tried to address this issue for
data posterior to 2007 by assisting the authorities to fill in the required reporting forms for the IMF.
The mission also urged the National Committee of the Balance of Payments, in charge of data
validation, to validate data for 2011 onwards. The mission has noted that though data sources were
reliable, the lack of motivation of respondents undermined the coverage of cross-border financial
transactions. Balance of payments data through 2007 are published in the Fund’s International
Financial Statistics (IFS), and STA is expecting the authorities to update the data series this year. Data
on the International Investment Position is not compiled.
B. Data Standards and Quality
The Republic of Congo participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since
November 5, 2003. However, the metadata posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin
Board (DSBB) has not been updated since 2003. No data ROSC is available.

REPUBLIC OF CONGO
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION—
DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

July 1, 2015

Approved By
Anne-Marie Gulde-Wolf
and Bob Traa (IMF)
and John Panzer (IDA)

The Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) has been prepared
jointly by IMF and World Bank staff, in consultation with the
authorities, using the debt sustainability framework for lowincome countries approved by the Boards of both
institutions.

This debt sustainability analysis (DSA) concludes that the Republic of Congo faces a moderate risk
of debt distress. This is a higher risk relative to the analysis prepared in the previous year.1 It
confirms the vulnerability of the Congolese economy to external shocks, in particular to declines in
oil prices and external demand, even in a baseline scenario with sustained fiscal adjustment. Under
the baseline scenario for the current DSA, the present value of debt-to GDP ratio temporarily
breaches the policy-dependent indicative threshold in 2015 and 2016. The other debt burden
indicators are projected to remain below the policy-dependent indicative thresholds. Standard
stress tests result in multiple breaches of these thresholds. The solitary breach under the baseline,
coupled with these stress test breaches would normally give rise to a “high risk of debt distress”
classification. However, an analysis based on net debt that takes into account Congo’s sizable
government deposits at the regional central bank indicates that there are only sustained breaches
of the thresholds under the stress tests. On this basis, Congo is classified as at “moderate risk of
debt distress“. In order to increase the resilience of the Congolese economy, in addition to the fiscal
adjustment assumed in the baseline scenario, efforts should continue to focus on diversification of
the tradable sectors. Moreover, medium-and long-term fiscal and debt sustainability can be
promoted through continued adherence to prudent borrowing policies and building of fiscal
buffers.

1

This DSA is based on end–2014 debt data. The 2014 DSA (see IMF Country Report No. 14/272) was based on end–
2013 debt data. The fiscal year for the Republic of Congo is January–December.

REPUBLIC OF CONGO

BACKGROUND
1.
Congo’s stock of external debt has continued its upward trend since the extensive
HIPC/MRDI debt relief in 2010. Congo reached the HIPC Initiative Completion Point in
January 2010. This resulted in estimated total debt service savings of US$1.9 billion, and a decline in
gross public external debt to just over 20 percent of GDP at end–2010 (from about 55 percent of
GDP in 2009) (See Press Release No. 10/20, January 28, 2010). However, the estimated external debt
stock at the end of 2014 amounted to around US$4.9 billion, up from US$2.4 billion in 2010.2 The
debt-to-GDP ratio increased steadily over the past 3 years, reflecting new borrowing, notably large
disbursements under bilateral loan agreements with China, contracted between 2006 and 2014.3
Bilateral creditors currently comprise nearly two-thirds of total debt (see Table 1). Domestic public
debt is relatively low at around 5.4 percent of GDP at end–2014 and consists mostly of domestic
arrears. The bulk of domestic arrears involve pension arrears and unpaid social benefits which
started accumulating after the liquidation of public enterprises in the past as employees may not
have been rightfully terminated.4

This figure includes also the external arrears stock of US$683.7 million at end–2014. More than ⅔ are related to
commercial creditors, for which legal decisions are pending. No timeline has been provided by the authorities for
the resolution of these cases. The rest is owed to bilateral creditors for which the provisions of debt relief under the
HIPC Initiative are still under discussion.
3

The loans from China are denominated in US dollars and obtained on a concessional basis (20 years maturity,
5 years grace period, 0.25 percent interest rate).
4

The authorities are currently undertaking an audit of domestic arrears. To protect their buffers, the authorities
intend to put in place a multi-year repayment plan once the audit is completed. In 2014 and 2015, there may also
have been a buildup of domestic arrears because of the tight fiscal situation from the decline in oil prices.

2.
The sustainability of Congo’s external debt should be assessed in the context of the
country’s sizeable financial assets (Table 2). The government gross debt to GDP ratio increased in
2014 reflecting continued borrowing on concessional terms, the terms of trade loss from the sharp
decline in oil prices in the second half of 2014 which limited nominal GDP growth, as well as debt
valuation changes from the depreciation of the CFAF relative to the dollar. While a substantial
amount of buffers were used during 2014, gross reserves at about 45 percent of GDP at end-2014
remain sizable. Moreover, the government’s total deposits while lower than in 2013 remain fairly
sizeable partly owing to the government drawing on statutory advances to the tune of 5.5 percent
of GDP. As a result, total government deposits at end–2014 are equivalent to about 89 percent of
the net present value of gross external public debt.

There is a need to strengthen public debt and asset management.5 The August 2013 IMF
public debt management technical assistance needs assessment mission highlighted the need to :
(i) strengthen the legal and institutional framework to cover the entire process of issuing and
managing debt; (ii) develop a medium-term debt management strategy and enhance transparency
in debt management; (iii) introduce a formal framework for managing the government's cash flows;
and (iv) strengthen the staff analytical capabilities with respect to managing the public debt.

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
4.
The medium and long-term macroeconomic framework underlying the DSA is
consistent with the baseline scenario presented in the Staff Report for the 2015 Article IV
Consultation. The main assumptions and projections for key macroeconomic variables are
summarized in Box 1. Economic activity in the near to medium term is expected to reflect
developments in oil production and prices. Oil production is expected to reach peak production of

Department to strengthen debt management.

about 128 million barrels in 2018 as new oil fields come on streams, and then moderate in the
following years. Oil prices dipped in the second half of 2014 and are projected to stay below 80
dollars per barrel in the medium term. The decline in oil prices is associated with a drop in overall
nominal GDP in 2015. Non–oil growth is expected to average 3.2 percent over 2015–20, reflecting
developments in forestry, agriculture, commerce and transport/communication sectors, and the
delay of mining projects. The authorities are expected to tighten fiscal policy in the near and
medium term, scaling back capital expenditures and prioritizing projects once the large outlays
associated with the fall 2015 All Africa Games are made. The path of public expenditure is projected
to permit the public capital stock to reach a level exceeding that typically observed in middle
income countries. Private investment is expected to pick up, attracted by an improved infrastructure
base and a friendlier business climate.
5.
Assumptions regarding external borrowing have been largely maintained compared to
the macroeconomic framework underpinning last year’s DSA (see Table 3). As in last year’s DSA,
the debt profile reflects not only already committed loans, but also the authorities’ medium term
borrowing plans taking into account their commitment to fiscal consolidation. New gross external
borrowing over the medium term (2015–22) is expected to total around US$3.3 billion. It is assumed
that Congo continues to obtain external financing on highly concessional terms, in line with the
agreement signed with China in 2012. The degree of concessionality is assumed to lessen after 2025.
Compared to previous DSAs, the grant element remains unchanged at about 48 percent reflecting 5
years of grace period, 20 years maturity and low interest rate on loans.
6.
Under the baseline, the current account balance is expected to be negative over
2015–16, but to turn positive in later years. These developments are mainly driven by the lower
international oil price, the investments in the oil sector that result in an initial upward trend in
imports of goods and services, and developments in oil production. The Moho Nord deep offshore
field, developed by Total jointly with Chevron and SNPC, is expected to attract around US$10 billion
of foreign direct investments over 2013–16. Also the recent discovery by ENI of the Nené–Banga and
Litchendjili offshore fields is expected at its peak to further add over 140,000 barrels per day to oil
production. These two fields will reach their full production potential in the period 2017–18, when
Congolese oil production is expected to peak. Considering the current highly uncertain conditions in
the mining sector, the start of mining production is projected to be delayed until after 2021. The
commencement of production on large mining projects is dependent upon the removal of
significant sector-specific infrastructure bottlenecks in transportation, the financing of which is being
hindered by the uncertain outlook for the global market for iron ore. In the long run, as oil exports
decline and non-oil export receipts fail to compensate for this loss, additional financing would be
needed. The present DSA assumes that the financing gap after 2025 is filled on concessional terms,
although with a lower grant element than that under the current Chinese loans. 6

6

The grant element of new borrowing in the long term is assumed to be around 28 percent, mainly reflecting higher
interest rates.

REPUBLIC OF CONGO

Box 1. Republic of Congo: Main Macroeconomic Assumptions

2



Real GDP growth: The non-oil sector is projected to grow on average by 3.2 percent per year during
2015–20 driven by agriculture, forestry, commerce and transport/communication sectors; non-oil
growth would stabilize at about 5 percent thereafter. The estimated potential of mining in Congo is
more than 50 million tons of iron per year. However, given the uncertainties surrounding the mining
projects (including sluggish global demand and the associated low prices, and the need for large
investment in infrastructure) the baseline projections for mining output are conservative. It is
assumed that major mining projects will not commence until 2021, with a small volume of
production in that year.



Oil production and prices: Annual oil production is projected at around 92 million barrels in 2015
and expected to peak at 128 million barrels in 2018. Based on official projections, production would
steadily decline over 2019–34, to about 13 million barrels in 2034. International oil prices dipped
significantly in the latter half of 2014 and are expected to stay depressed throughout 2015, affecting
overall nominal GDP in this year. Following projections in the IMF’s World Economic Outlook,
international oil prices are projected to increase from their 2015 low by an average of 5 percent over
the period until 2020; thereafter, they are assumed to remain constant in real terms.



Inflation: Annual average inflation decelerated to 0.9 percent in 2014 from 4.6 percent in 2015,
largely on the back of lower food prices. In the medium term, inflation is projected to stay below the
CEMAC’s convergence criteria of 3 percent.



Current account balance: Current account fluctuations are driven by the dynamics of exports and
imports in the oil and in the public sectors. The balance is expected to trend positive as oil
production increases up to 2018; the upward trend of the current account balance is expected to be
reinforced by declining government imports associated with the expected fiscal consolidation. As oil
production declines after the peak in 2018, it is expected that the current account will revert to a
small deficit in 2020.



Fiscal balance: With the government already holding back capital expenditures for priority projects
in 2015, the baseline projections assume that fiscal consolidation continues in 2016 and continues in
the medium- and long-terms. The basic non-oil primary deficit on a cash basis would narrow from
about 46 percent of non-oil GDP in 2015 to about 18 percent in 2020 and close to zero in the long
run. Staff’s projected fiscal outturn implies under implementation of the approved 2015 budget. A
supplementary 2015 budget has been approved by the cabinet and is awaiting formal ratification by
parliament.



External financing: In the medium term, the authorities are assumed to continue to borrow
externally at similarly concessional terms as in the recent past. In 2014, an additional CFAF 313 billion
(about US$ 630 million) was disbursed under the terms of the bilateral agreements with China,
implying that the funds available under these accords have been fully disbursed. This is assumed to
be followed by additional borrowing over the period 2015–22 to the tune of another US$ 3.3 billion
from various sources. These disbursements would contribute to address Congo’s infrastructure gap.
In the long run, external borrowing is expected to decline as a percentage of GDP, with primarily
domestic sources ensuring the development of the long run capital stock. The concessionality level is
expected to lessen after 2025.

REPUBLIC OF CONGO

DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
C. External DSA
7.
Under the baseline, all Congo’s debt indicators, except the PV of debt to GDP ratio, are
below the relevant country-specific debt burden thresholds (Figure 1). The joint Bank-Fund
debt sustainability framework (DSF) for low-income countries classifies Congo as a “weak”
performer, based on the quality of the country’s policies and institutions as measured by the 3-year
average of the ratings under the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA).
This is reflected in lower debt sustainability thresholds compared to countries operating in a strong
policy environment.7 For 2015–16, the PV of debt to GDP ratio breaches the policy-dependent
indicative threshold, mainly reflecting the impact of lower international oil prices on Congo’s
economy.
8.
Three of the stress tests breach significantly the indicative threshold (Figure 1).
Standard bound tests that examine the implications of various shocks to the debt and debt-service
paths based on the country’s historical volatility result in sharp increases in the debt burden
indicators. For the PV of debt-to-exports ratio and the debt service-to-exports ratio, the most
extreme scenario is associated with a shock to exports. 8A decline in exports to a level equivalent to
one standard deviation below their historical average in the first two years of the projection period
would cause the present value of debt-to-exports ratio to rise by about 170 percentage points at its
peak. Similarly, the present value of the debt service-to-exports ratio would rise by 18 percentage
points at its peak, in response to the same shock. For the remaining indicators, the most extreme
shock is also the exports shock. In response to a half standard deviation shock to exports, the PV of
the debt to GDP ratio would rise by about 40 percentage points at its peak and remain above the
critical threshold throughout the forecast horizon. For the remaining indicators, the most extreme
scenario either implies a temporary slight breach (the present value of debt-to-revenue ratio) or a
persistent breach of (the present value of debt service-to-revenue ratio) the respective threshold.
9.
The breach of the policy-dependent PV of the debt to GDP ratio threshold in 2015 and
2016 under the baseline together with multiple breaches of the thresholds under the stress
tests would give rise to a downgrade of Congo to a “high risk of debt distress.” Under the
historical scenario, which derives the debt indicators assuming that key variables are at their 10–year
historical averages, the present value of debt to GDP and the present value of debt-to-revenue

7

The thresholds for weak performers are 100, 30 and 200 percent for the PV of debt to exports, GDP and
government revenue, respectively. Debt service thresholds are 15 and 18 percent of exports and revenue,
respectively.
8

The vulnerability stems from the very high share of oil in Congo’s exports (about 80 percent) and the significant
volatility of oil prices and production. The magnitude of the shock is comparable to that of last year’s DSA
(-11.5 percent, compared with -10 percent in 2014).

ratios decline very rapidly. However, as pointed out in previous DSAs, this scenario is less relevant
for resource-rich countries since past trends are likely to be a poor predictor of future outcomes.
10.
A debt sustainability analysis that takes into account Congo’s sizable government
deposits at the regional central bank would suggest that Congo could be classified as at
“moderate risk of debt distress (Figure 3). Here, Congo’s significant accumulated deposits at the
central bank mitigate the degree of debt distress.9 They permit the reduction of the present value of
Congo’s debt obligations, such that the present value of the relevant net debt stock and net debt
service ratios remain comfortably below the debt burden thresholds under the baseline. In this
analysis, however, there continue to be sustained breaches of the thresholds under the stress tests.
A DSA analysis that takes into account Congo’s deposits abroad would further support the proposed
moderate risk of debt distress rating.

D. Public DSA
11.
Adding domestic public debt to external debt does not change the results of the
analysis (see Figures 2 and 4). Congo’s domestic public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt
includes domestic arrears.10 Under the baseline, the total public debt indicators tend to diminish
over time. However, the potential evolution of the public debt ratios carries a warning regarding the
present expansionary stance of fiscal policy. Under the alternative ‘fix primary balance’ scenario,
under which the primary balance is unchanged from 2015 onwards, all public debt ratios increase
significantly going forward. Regarding the stress tests, the most extreme shock (in this case real GDP
growth in 2016–17 set at one standard deviation below its historical average) raises the PV of debt
to GDP ratio in the outer years (from 2019) of the projection period, and stabilizes at this level. A
permanently lower GDP growth would have a similar, albeit somewhat smaller, effect on the present
value of the debt-to-revenue ratio. The accumulation of official foreign reserves, which in the case of
Congo is significant due to previous years of high primary surpluses, can be regarded as a buffer
against these potential shocks.

AUTHORITIES’ VIEW
12.
The Republic of Congo’s authorities broadly concurred with the overall assessment of
moderate risk of debt distress. They reiterated their commitment to prudent fiscal policy that
should help to alleviate their financing needs as well as to preserve the government deposits at the
central bank that would provide a buffer against adverse shocks. The authorities also reaffirmed that
they do not want to repeat the experience from the beginning of the 2000s, when debt exceeded by
9

It is assumed that Congo is able to use its deposits at the central bank (US$2.46 billion at end 2014) to offset future
debt service payments on bilateral loans with China.
10

Although there are indications that domestic arrears may be substantially larger, these do not represent legally
verified claims. Therefore, they cannot be included in the DSA. The DSA’s standard stress test whereby the debt ratio
is raised by 10 percent of GDP can be thought of as illustrating the effect of adding domestic arrears to the stock of
domestic debt upon their possible verification.

far the CEMAC convergence criteria. They assured staff of their plans to continue to borrow only on
highly concessional terms. Finally, and in light of the ongoing run of lower international oil prices,
the authorities’ strategy continues to center around economic diversification.

CONCLUSION
13.
In the Staff’s view, the Republic of Congo faces a medium-term moderate risk of debt
distress. An analysis of net debt that takes into consideration the government’s large deposits at
the regional central bank finds that all external debt indicators are well below the country-specific
indicative thresholds under the baseline scenario but three of these thresholds are breached for a
sustained period under the various standard stress tests. In view of the persistent low oil prices and
decline in fiscal and external buffers, Congo may resort to external borrowing in the near future. It is
therefore important for the government to anchor macroeconomic policies by a stability oriented
medium-term fiscal framework that targets a reduction of the non-oil primary fiscal deficit and to
maintain gross official reserves above five months of prospective imports of goods and services to
support the exchange rate peg and to prepare for the post-oil era. The pattern seen in the last
3 years with respect to external borrowing underscores the constrained capacity to finance large
infrastructure projects. Since we expect this trend to continue, new borrowing contracts should
reflect similar concessional terms as the recent ones in order to maintain debt sustainability.
14.
Improving competitiveness and promoting economic diversification are keys to
increasing resilience to exogenous shocks. As the DSA indicates, Congo’s debt ratios appear to be
most sensitive to swings in exports. Given the high concentration and vulnerability of the economy
to downward movements in oil prices, broadening of the economic base by enhancing the
development of the non-oil sector would reduce the volatility of exports and would strengthen the
debt service capacity of the Congolese economy. In this regard, efforts toward improving the
business climate with assistance from the World Bank should help strengthen competitiveness and
boost growth. In the same vein, in addressing Congo’s weak physical and human capital, priority
should be given to making electricity supply more reliable and competitive, and to enhancing the
quality of transportation services and of the labor force.
15.
Focusing on policies to strengthen public debt and asset management and institutions
could enhance the Congolese authorities’ capacity to manage debt and fiscal policies. In the
DSA framework, this would raise the Congolese economies’ debt-carrying capacity, by raising the
country’s CPIA rating. Moreover the development and integration of the regional debt market within
the CEMAC area would broaden the menu of options to manage the Republic of Congo’s financing
needs. The issuance of government securities would also provide an alternative means of financing
but would hinge on the strengthening of institutions and analytical capacities.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).

4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.
