EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background and Outlook. Growth picked up significantly in 2004 driven by an investment
and export surge related to EU entry, but inflation remained low, owing to continued slack in
the economy. Supported by cross-border integration of production, strong export growth
improved the external accounts. The fiscal deficit narrowed—reversing a widening trend—
but largely because of one-off factors. Staff and the authorities shared the view that, under
the baseline, growth will remain healthy in 2005–06, led by domestic demand and supported
by net exports. Risks around this baseline appear evenly balanced. Headline inflation is
expected to remain low in 2005–06 as continued economic slack and moderate wage growth
are likely to contain second-round effects of oil price increases. All agreed that the Czech
Republic’s main problem is that growth might not be sustained if problems stemming from
continued rigidities in the labor market and business-legal environment, and challenges from
an aging population are not addressed. The authorities judged that consensus on their reform
strategy might be elusive prior to June 2006 elections.
Policy Discussions:
Monetary policy: Current market and official expectations suggest that inflation is likely to
remain below the 3 percent target through the end of 2006. However, uncertainties call for a
cautious approach to future interest rate changes.
Fiscal policy: While a withdrawal of fiscal stimulus in 2004 was appropriate, staff is
concerned that fiscal consolidation is set to be reversed in 2005. With growth remaining
strong, staff emphasize the desirability of accelerating and deepening fiscal consolidation,
particularly in light of the backloading of expenditure adjustment under the authorities’ fiscal
plans. Adjustment should come from expenditure reforms, and centered on entitlement
reform and expenditure rationalization in all budget chapters. Sustained fiscal consolidation
through the medium–term—focusing on pensions, healthcare, and benefits reform—is
needed to prepare for aging.
Structural policy: All sides agreed that the pace of structural reform should be accelerated to
sustain strong growth. Progress in improving the business-legal environment has been made,
but more is required, and implementation of labor market reforms has been piecemeal.
A virtually flat employment trend despite solid GDP growth in recent years suggests that the
flexibility of the labor market may be eroding. Staff argue for a comprehensive agenda,
combining labor market and entitlement reforms.
Financial sector: The financial system is sound, and well-positioned to withstand moderate
macroeconomic shocks. Staff welcome progress made in strengthening the financial system,
but recommend closer integration of stress-testing with bank supervision, and further
improvements in data collection.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Following a decade of moderate growth, the Czech Republic enjoyed a strong
recovery last year, as it entered the European Union. Investment surged, as external
demand recovered and firms adapted to the EU environment. A record-breaking export
performance narrowed the trade deficit, and growth rose. Fiscal developments were also
positive, while inflation and real interest rates remained low, and the koruna appreciated.
These accomplishments confirm the Czech Republic’s strengths as one of the most open and
advanced new EU members (Figure 1 and Table 1).
2.
However, raising or even sustaining growth in the future will require addressing
key policy challenges. Despite the recent spurt, growth has conformed to the modest trend of
surrounding Central European Countries (CEECs) (Figure 1). Aging pressures—more
pronounced than in most other OECD countries and CEECs—compounded by work
disincentives for the young and a tendency of older workers to exit the labor market early,
are set to harm growth and fiscal sustainability (text figure). Although public sector
indebtedness is moderate at present, primary fiscal deficits are large (Figure 1). Obstacles to
geographical mobility and skills mismatches between jobseekers and vacancies have
perpetuated structural unemployment, and foreign investors consider that weaknesses in the
business-legal environment could discourage future investment.
...and by 2050, the elderly will account for more
than half of the population.

3.
Despite initial steps and the development of a medium-term strategy, overall
progress in structural and fiscal reforms has been slow (Box 1). The medium-term
strategy aims to reach the EU average GDP per capita by 2013.1 But consensus on key
aspects of this strategy has been elusive among the governing coalition, which has a slim
parliamentary majority. Pension, healthcare, and entitlements reforms are unlikely before the
June 2006 parliamentary elections.
Box 1. Past Fund Policy Recommendations and Implementation
The pace of policy implementation has largely reflected difficulties in building domestic
political consensus. Despite agreement on the need for fiscal consolidation, progress in
expenditure reform so far has been slow. Although the authorities have made progress on
privatization, key reforms to improve labor market flexibility and strengthen creditor rights,
long supported by staff, are also lagging.
On monetary policy, the Fund has consistently supported the authorities’ operation of the
inflation-targeting regime, apart from some nuances on the timing of monetary policy
responses to changing macroeconomic conditions. All agree on the need to continue to
strengthen monitoring of systemic sources of risks, and for the authorities to develop stress
testing as a way to supervise more proactively the financial sector.

II. BACKGROUND
4.
Buoyant exports and investment supported
brisk economic activity in 2004. Annual growth
reached almost 4½ percent. The contribution of the
external sector turned positive, and export-related
investment rose in response to the growing crossborder integration of production (text figure and
Figure 2). Foreign-owned firms now account for most
industrial exports. Household consumption grew only
modestly, as lagging employment weighed on
disposable incomes, and government consumption
declined. In the second half of 2004, in line with
regional developments, growth started to lose steam,
as domestic demand weakened. However, it remained
firmer than in other CEECs, sustained by healthy
export growth and a rising external sector
contribution. Quarter-on-quarter export and import

growth increased in the first quarter of 2005, and investment growth was positive. Given the
strong correlation of Czech exports and industrial production with German leading
indicators, the near-term outlook for exports and investment remains favorable (Figure 3).
5.
Despite the economic recovery, employment
rose only modestly in 2004 due to ongoing
restructuring (Figure 4). Foreign direct investment
and continued restructuring led to a significant pickup
in labor productivity, but structural unemployment
persisted, owing to skills and regional mismatches and
policy-induced disincentives to work. Restrained by
cyclical unemployment, wages grew moderately,
which, combined with productivity increases, resulted
in a modest increase in unit labor costs.

Inflationary pressures remain low.

potential output series, implying a negative but small
output gap in 2004–05 using staff GDP projections. Together with low inflation expectations,
this has helped contain wage increases and inflation. A fortuitous combination of koruna
appreciation, good harvest, and strong retail competition also kept core inflation low in 2004
(text figure and Figure 5). With exports outpacing imports and the terms of trade improving,
trade was nearly balanced in 2004, and the current account deficit narrowed substantially.
The latter was largely financed by FDI (Table 2 and Figure 6).

7.
New budgetary rules and strong growth helped narrow the general government
deficit in 2004. The adjusted general government deficit declined from above 4¾ percent in
2003 to 3¼ percent in 2004 (6 percent had been expected in the budget) (Table 3).2 Almost
1 percentage point of the decline in the deficit reflected changes in the budgetary rules that

2

The adjusted deficit is a cash-based definition consistent with GFS 86, which excludes
privatization receipts and transfers to the Czech Consolidation Agency (CKA) but includes
nonprivatization net lending. The authorities use an alternate cash-based deficit definition for
their targets, which excludes privatization receipts, net lending, and transfers to
transformation institutions. An accrual-based ESA 95 deficit measure is used for the
Convergence Program targets. Fiscal analysis in this report is based on the adjusted deficit
definition, since detailed fiscal tables are available only on this basis. Differences between
the adjusted deficit and ESA 95 methodology are explained in Appendix II.

allowed line ministries to carry over unspent allocations to future years.3 It also reflected
some reduction in sickness benefits and public employment. At the same time, tax revenues,
adjusted for collection delays relating to EU accession, remained strong, given a pickup in
growth and the harmonization of indirect taxes with the EU.
8.
In line with regional trends, market sentiment on the Czech Republic remains
positive. Supported by a rebalancing of investors’ portfolios following accession of CEECs
into the EU, portfolio outflows reversed in 2004 (Figure 6). Ample global liquidity and the
favorable performance of the Czech economy helped lower spreads. Long-term interest rates
and sovereign bond spreads are similar or narrower than those for other CEECs (Figure 7).
Following depreciation in 2003, the koruna strengthened in 2004–early 2005, in line with
regional trends, although interest rate increases in the summer of 2004 might have also
contributed. Appreciation has slowed recently, possibly reflecting a smaller risk appetite by
investors and greater uncertainty following rejection of the EU constitution by some
countries, as well as the April cut in policy rates.
III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
9.
Discussions covered demands on policies in the face of weakening activity in
Europe, difficult fiscal problems, and an aging population. The key issues were the
sustainability and credibility of fiscal policy, structural reforms to support the medium-term
growth objectives, and the maintenance of a monetary policy attuned to an evolving
macroeconomic situation. The authorities saw maintaining fiscal policy within the
Convergence Program parameters as the immediate priority. They were also trying to lay the
groundwork for reforms that could be implemented following the 2006 elections. While
recognizing the uncertainty surrounding long-term simulations, all agreed that population
aging, a focus of this year’s consultation, would have tangible effects on growth and the
fiscal balance (Box 2). Dealing with these effects requires an integrated policy response
comprising fiscal reforms, efforts to promote labor force participation and labor market
flexibility, and measures to improve the business-legal environment.4 The authorities
acknowledged that these policies were also essential to support investment, which was key to
realizing the favorable growth scenario they envisaged.
10.
Recognizing that euro adoption goals provide direction to policies, the
authorities noted that the exact timing for adoption would be revisited after the
elections. The goal is to adopt the euro around 2009–10, and the authorities’ euro area
accession strategy emphasizes the importance of appropriate preconditions for joining. The

Box 2. How Will Population Aging Affect the Czech Economy?1/
The Czech Republic faces a severe demographic shock in
the coming decades. With rising longevity and the secondlowest fertility rate in the world, the Czech population is
aging and projected to get smaller. By 2050, the elderly
will account for 53 percent of the population, and the
working-age population will shrink by 22 percent
compared with 2005.

on pensions and health care to rise to 22 percent of GDP
by 2050 from about 14 percent in 2005. Using a long-term
debt sustainability and fiscal scenario analysis based on the generational accounting framework, staff
projects an unsustainable fiscal position, with debt reaching 100 percent of GDP by 2025. The
intertemporal fiscal gap—the adjustment in the primary deficit needed to meet the intertemporal
budget constraint—is estimated at over 10 percent of GDP in net present value terms. Every two-year
delay will raise the needed adjustment by ⅓ percent of GDP. To maintain net debt at 60 percent of
GDP by 2050, a smooth adjustment targeting a primary balance or a small surplus beginning early in
the next decade would be needed.

Private saving remains inadequate in the face of population aging. Staff estimates that household
financial assets―currently around 140 percent of disposable income―need to rise to be consistent
with the structural determinants observed in more advanced countries and to prepare for aging.
Households also need to redistribute their assets from nonfinancial assets, currently accounting for
60 percent of their total assets, and low-return financial assets into more strategic forms of long-term
investment.

authorities agreed that euro adoption could bring gains for trade and growth, provided
supporting policies were strong, and recognized that reducing the fiscal deficit in a
sustainable manner was the main challenge. They were also concerned that adopting the euro
without addressing the fiscal and structural rigidities could lead to a prolonged period of slow
growth. Staff agreed that fiscal and structural reforms were essential to avoid a slow-growth
equilibrium in the euro area.
A. Economic Outlook
11.
There was a broad agreement about the outlook for 2005–06, with all predicting
rising consumption and a deceleration of investment and exports from exceptional rates
in 2004 (Table 4). While investment will slow, reflecting the disappearance of one-off
factors in 2004 and recent appreciation, high profitability and continued FDI and
infrastructure investment should prevent more than a moderate deceleration. Softer external
demand and koruna appreciation are also expected to lower year-on-year export growth.
Private consumption is likely to strengthen, benefiting from higher employment and wage
growth, and anticipation of income tax cuts. The government is expected to provide a
positive stimulus in 2005. Staff, thus, projects growth of 4 percent in 2005–06, with the trade
account posting a surplus and the current account deficit narrowing to just over 3 percent of
GDP. Leading indicators and first quarter results for 2005 are broadly consistent with the
baseline forecast (Figure 3), and risks around it appear evenly balanced. On the one hand, a
slowdown in the EU, higher oil prices, and weaker employment would dampen growth. On
the other, a pickup in EU growth compared to baseline, a larger-than-expected fiscal impulse
or faster wage growth would stimulate growth in the short run.
12.
Over the medium term, strong prospects for growth and sustainable
macroeconomic balances will require fiscal adjustment. In line with the authorities’ view,
staff estimates potential growth at less than 4 percent, although all acknowledge that

activities. Access to EU funds should also help upgrade infrastructure. A sizable fiscal
consolidation over the medium term would be needed to accommodate strong fixed
investment, while keeping the current account deficit below 3 percent of GDP and debt ratios
on a sustainable path.
B. Fiscal Policy
13.
The authorities have outlined a fiscal adjustment plan that seeks to reverse the
general trend over the past six years toward larger primary deficits and meet the
Maastricht deficit criterion by 2008 (text table). The plan—broadly consistent with the

supply-side incentives, the
authorities have started to phase in reductions in corporate income taxes, cumulatively
amounting to about ¾ percent of GDP over 2004–06. In addition, they are planning to
introduce permanent personal income tax cuts for low- and middle-income taxpayers of
about ⅓ percent of GDP in 2006. Thus, further adjustment needs to rely on expenditure
reductions. The authorities have broadly identified spending reform measures in the areas of
social benefit reform, public employment and wages, and discretionary cuts in all budgetary
chapters, but these have yet to be approved.
14.
Staff viewed these targets as
adequate given debt sustainability
considerations, but expressed
concerns about risks to the fiscal
plan. Under the staff’s baseline
scenario, assuming the authorities
adhere to their 2005–07 plan and
continue consolidation to bring the
deficit to around 2½ percent of GDP by
2010, public debt is projected to reach
around 30 percent of GDP by 2010
(text figure and Table 6). Adhering to
this smooth adjustment path up to 2010

a sustaninable debt ratio in the face of aging pressures (Box 2). Staff noted, however, that
even in this relatively favorable scenario, there would be risks. A large share of outstanding
guarantees is considered to be high risk and could be called.5 If commitment to reform were
to wane and primary deficits remained at the average level of 2002–04, debt could climb to
40 percent of GDP by 2010. In this scenario, the easy financing conditions the government
has enjoyed so far may not last, and debt servicing costs would rise. An immediate challenge
to the credibility of the authorities’ fiscal plan is that adjustment is back-loaded to 2006–07,
while significant permanent measures needed to achieve this adjustment have not yet been
approved.
15.
Staff argued for bolstering the plan’s credibility by shifting forward to 2005 part
of the adjustment and adopting permanent measures to meet the medium-term plans.
Current budgetary plans for 2005 imply a significant expansionary stance relative to GDP—a
1½ percentage point increase in the adjusted deficit, including approved spending from last
year’s reserves of ½ percent of GDP—which would neither be apt with growth running at
close to potential nor consistent with the strategy of gradual consolidation (text table).

target would ensure the credibility of the consolidation plan and contain growth in public

debt in the face of significant long-term debt sustainability pressures. In addition, frontloading of adjustment to 2005 would limit a procyclical fiscal stimulus in 2005 and minimize
inefficient spending implied by the significant carryover from the 2004 allocation apart from
cofinancing for EU transfers. This could be achieved by maintaining the growth of
discretionary spending on goods and services at historical rates, and containing
extrabudgetary fund spending financed out of privatization revenues at the 2004 levels. Even
if the authorities were to implement staff’s recommendations for 2005, reducing the deficit in
2006–07 would still require expenditure measures amounting to a cumulative 1⅓ percent of
GDP. The mission urged the authorities to specify their plans for permanent savings in 2006–
07 soon.
16.
Although the authorities agreed that front-loading consolidation is desirable,
they thought that the scope for savings in 2005 was smaller than suggested by staff.
They noted that work on systemic expenditure reform was not sufficiently advanced to allow
implementing measures in 2005. Moreover, they viewed the 2004 overperformance as oneoff, related to EU-entry and changed budgetary rules allowing the carryover of unspent
allocations, and noted election-year spending pressures, increasing demand for cofinancing
of EU transfers, and downward risks in VAT collections. In this context, staff expressed
concerns that the recently-proposed measures to lower personal income taxes could
undermine fiscal targets, and cautioned that any further tax cuts need to be offset through
expenditure cuts or base-broadening measures.
17.
The authorities shared staff concerns about longer-term budgetary pressures
from population aging. The rapid rise in elderly dependency ratio and the high public
burden of age-related spending (text figure) calls for decisive reform in pensions, healthcare
and social benefits (Box 2).

18.
A stronger fiscal framework would help reinforce discipline at a time of
increasing risk of fiscal drift. The authorities acknowledged that budgetary shortcomings,
as reflected in persistent underspending of budgets in the past, combined with carryover
provisions, posed significant risks for fiscal policy implementation. Staff noted that
expenditure ceilings had been weakened by carryover rules allowing spending from reserves
outside the ceilings, and that transparency was hindered by off-budget spending and delays in
fiscal reporting on extrabudgetary funds.6 The finance minister intends to explore ways to
strengthen budgetary rules on carryover spending to enhance the discipline of the fiscal
framework. Given concerns about debt sustainability, staff recommended introducing a fiscal
rule that targeted a structural balance or a small surplus over the medium term. This
indicative fiscal stance is based on staff’s debt sustainability analysis incorporating
demographic projections (Box 2). While the authorities did not discard the idea of new,
stronger fiscal rules, for now they were concentrating on meeting targets under their fiscal
framework.
C. Monetary Policy
19.
A reassessment of the inflation outlook in early 2005 led the CNB to reduce
policy rates (Figure 9). The CNB considered that the cumulative rate cut of 75 basis points
in January–April had been needed because two factors had led to a downward revision of

The National Property Fund (NPF) is expected to close at end-2005, and the accounts will
be transferred to the Ministry of Finance. But spending from the NPF account will remain
outside the expenditure ceilings and the budget. Transfers to the CKA financed through
bonds are also treated as outside the budget.

inflation projections: substantial additions to productive capacity had delayed the closing of
the output gap and the stronger-than-expected koruna appreciation had led to lower import
prices. Staff agreed with this assessment, noting that retail competition and productivity
growth, which appeared to be stronger in the Czech Republic than in other CEECs, also
helped delay the onset of inflationary pressures (text table). The limited second-round effects
of indirect tax and regulated price increases also suggest low inflationary expectations,
pointing to the increased credibility of monetary policy. Headline inflation is now about
1½ percent, below the CNB target band, and the CNB’s main policy rate stands at
1¾ percent, 25 basis points below the ECB rate.

20.
The CNB thought that the outlook for inflation remained benign and did not
envisage a need for further interest rate changes in the near future. Like staff, they have
a baseline projection with average CPI inflation staying below 2 percent in 2005 and rising to
2¼ percent by end-2006—below the 3 percent point target but within the lower half of the
tolerance band. The CNB considered that the structure of growth (driven by investment and
exports) and other noncyclical factors were the main reasons for the low demand-pull price
pressures, and was concerned that an activist approach aimed at bringing inflation to the
point target might generate unnecessary interest rate volatility. Therefore, the CNB preferred
to await the effect of recent interest rate cuts before making further moves. While some
members of the CNB Board expressed doubts about the sustainability of a negative interest
differential with euro area rates, particularly given the more advanced stage of the cycle in
the Czech Republic, the prevailing view was that domestic rates were at the right level given
projected inflation. Staff agreed, and saw no need to link tightly CNB actions to ECB rates.
Over a longer horizon, the authorities envisaged an increase of real interest rates above the
current levels to maintain inflation on target.
21.
Monetary policy is complicated by uncertainties about fiscal policy. Some
members of the CNB Board emphasized the difficulty of deciding on the appropriate course
of action given doubts about the fiscal outturn in 2005. Nonetheless, they expected a smallerthan-budgeted expansion in 2005, which would maintain the policy mix consistent with a
benign inflation outlook and a narrowing external current account. The outlook after the 2006

- 25 -

elections was more uncertain. Further monetary policy moves would thus depend on
evidence of continued commitment to sustain fiscal consolidation.
22.
Noting the strength of exports and moderate growth in unit labor costs, the CNB
viewed competitiveness as adequate. Staff agreed that, despite the recent reversal of the
real depreciation of 2003, productivity and profitability growth outpaced that in partner
countries, and earlier gains in world market shares had been sustained (Figure 10).7 Because
Czech wages were higher than in the second-wave accession countries, staff flagged the risk
of wage growth exceeding significantly productivity growth (largely attributed to FDI
inflows until now). The authorities noted that some slowdown in FDI was to be anticipated,
even with strong competitiveness, owing to the low capital intensity of high-tech products
and strategic services that were expected to comprise the next wave of FDI.8
23.
The inflation-targeting framework has gained well-deserved credibility and is
expected to continue to anchor inflationary expectations. The post-2005 inflation
targeting framework (a 3 percent point target with a tolerance band of ±1 percent) announced
last year provides the necessary continuity with the existing end-2005 target (2–4 percent)
and should help anchor monetary policy in the run-up to euro adoption. The authorities
confirmed that, in this framework, the role of foreign exchange market intervention will
continue to be exceptional. Staff noted that it would be desirable for the Inflation Report to
clarify whether the forecast, which includes a path for interest rates, reflected the Board’s or
the staff’s views. The authorities acknowledged that there had been some ambiguity on that
score. They agreed to consider the staff’s suggestion, but noted that they thought they had
addressed the problem by shortening the publication lag of Board minutes and by holding
periodic meetings of both CNB Board members and staff with analysts.
D. Financial Sector Issues and Resilience to Shocks
24.
The authorities consider the banking sector sound and well-positioned to
withstand moderate macroeconomic shocks. Past restructuring and improved risk
management have strengthened banks. The capital-adequacy ratio, although declining in line

Empirical assessments of equilibrium exchange rates present a mixed picture. Cointegration
models suggest the koruna is close to equilibrium; however, these models have meanreverting properties. More forward-looking panel models indicate that over the longer term
the koruna might need to depreciate to service large foreign liabilities in a sustainable
manner.
8

The changing nature of capital flows, with an increasing importance of portfolio and other
investment flows, may lead to more macroeconomic volatility in the future, and monetary
policy may need to be more responsive in these circumstances (Selected Issues paper).

in early 2005 (text table). Nonperforming
loans remain low, and profitability has been
rising. Stress testing by the authorities in
consultation with MFD staff suggests that the
banking system would remain wellcapitalized under moderate shocks (text

The shared view was that rapid growth of credit to households could pose
financial stability risks in the future. Bank consumer and mortgage lending expanded,
albeit from a low base, at an annual rate of more than 30 percent in recent years (text table
above). The authorities considered vulnerabilities from lending to households to be contained
at present, given banks’ fairly low exposure to households (about 12 percent of assets) and
the small share of classified loans (3⅓ percent of mortgage loans and 11 percent of consumer
loans). Staff agreed, noting that further increases in household liabilities would be justified

- 28 -

by the standards of more developed countries.9 However, if financial assets do not keep pace,
households’ liquidity and solvency could be at risk under adverse macroeconomic shocks. In
particular, a return of real interest rates to levels significantly above zero could be disruptive
in case of substantial household indebtedness and high asset prices. Staff thus recommended
that supervisors consider taking a more proactive approach by integrating stress testing of
household loan quality more closely into their work. To this end, staff suggested collecting
data on household loan portfolio structure and prices of housing transactions, and encouraged
bank supervision to stay vigilant to any signs of banks easing credit standards. Looking
forward, population aging points to the need to encourage long-term savings programs
(Box 2). Accordingly, staff noted that pension fund regulations and savings subsidies may
need to be reviewed, as they appear to encourage medium-term savings at the expense of
long-term savings.

Most vulnerability indicators are at comfortable levels, but risks remain for the
government sector. A strong reserve position―official reserves cover about 1½ times the
economy’s short-term debt at remaining maturity―provides a cushion against any reasonable
temporary financing shortfall, while a floating exchange rate should enable smooth
adjustment to most shocks (Table 5). The

E. Long-Term Growth and Structural Policy
27.
Weaknesses in the business-legal environment risk discouraging future
investment and holding back growth. The Czech Republic’s proximity to Western Europe,
highly skilled labor force, low wages compared with EU-15 countries, and free access to the
rest of the EU market make the Czech Republic an attractive destination for foreign
investment. But representatives of the investor community still find the business-legal
environment wanting compared to the standards already adopted by some other countries in

confirm this assessment (Figure 11 and text figure). Investors flagged weak creditor rights,
excessive discretion of bankruptcy judges, and cumbersome and lengthy legal procedures as
key problems. The authorities noted the recent creation of the Business Environment
Development Council, a business-government consultative body that focuses on improving
the business-legal system, and the streamlining of company registration through the
introduction of single standardized forms and an automatic five-day deadline. Staff

The authorities are planning reforms in the labor market to increase flexibility
and prepare for an aging workforce. A virtually flat employment trend despite solid GDP
growth in recent years suggests that the flexibility of the labor market may be eroding. The
authorities attributed this trend to disincentives generated by the benefit system, skills
mismatches, and high nonwage costs. They have prepared legislation to tighten benefit
entitlements, encourage retraining, and increase geographical mobility. Staff welcomed the
legislation but noted delays in its adoption. It also considered that the intended effect on labor
participation of the planned reduction in income taxes is likely to be limited unless
accompanied by a reform of the benefits system. Disincentives to work are particularly
strong for younger workers with large families, among whom the unemployment rate is
5 percentage points higher than in families with no children. Social benefits could be
reformed to lower the implicit tax on employment and, in certain cases, introduce in-work
benefits. Attractive early retirement schemes and scope for abuse of disability benefits are
reducing the labor force participation of older workers. The authorities noted the recent
elimination of a generous early retirement pension scheme and ongoing discussions to better
control sickness benefits which act as a pathway for disability benefits. The authorities have
also proposed measures to encourage performance-based financing of schools and
universities, and improve R&D cooperation with industry. Staff agreed that this would help
preserve the Czech Republic’s attractiveness for FDI, and noted that other measures—
reducing impediments to labor mobility, including through easing rent control—would also
limit persistent skills mismatches.

Continued reduction in direct state involvement in the enterprise sector should
help improve allocative efficiency and supply-side responsiveness. The authorities
reported the privatization of Český Telecom and progress in the preparation for sale of the
electricity company (CEZ). The authorities also confirmed plans to divest most assets from
the CKA and to terminate its activities by end-2007. Meanwhile, they are not planning to
transfer new bad assets to CKA, and any such transfer will require parliamentary approval.
Staff welcomed this approach, underscoring that CKA bailouts of health insurance
companies under discussion should be resisted. In order to limit future drains on the budget,
staff reiterated that state support to strategic companies needs to take place only in the
context of viable restructuring plans and be transparently recorded in government accounts.
IV. Staff Appraisal
30.
The Czech Republic’s recent strong economic performance augurs well for its
near-term outlook. Substantial foreign direct investment and growing cross-border
integration of production processes have helped raise GDP growth and improve the external
balance. Inflation has stabilized at a low level, and the sovereign risk premium has fallen.
Corporate and banking profitability is strong, and banks remain well-capitalized to take
advantage of lending opportunities in a growing economy. A skilled workforce and an open
regime for trade and capital flows supports a large manufacturing and service base. After a
year in the EU, the Czech economy has shown dynamism, which provides comfort about the
economic outlook.
31.
But continued inaction in key areas could prevent the economy from realizing its
full potential over the medium term. The Czech Republic’s attractiveness to foreign and
domestic investors could be slowly undermined by continued rigidities in the labor market
and the business-legal environment, and an uncertain policy setting that shortens the horizon
for decision making. Without an early and comprehensive response, population aging is set
to slow growth and undermine the sustainability of the fiscal position. Implementing policies
to address these problems has become imperative to sustain economic performance and keep
pace with other new EU member states.
32.
An immediate priority is to accelerate fiscal consolidation. Robust growth offers
the opportunity to eliminate the back-loading of adjustment in the authorities’ fiscal plan and
strengthen its credibility in the face of significant long-term debt sustainability concerns. Part
of the adjustment can be shifted forward to 2005 by maintaining expenditure savings
achieved in 2004 and using revenues from stronger-than-expected growth to build in a
cyclical margin. Nonetheless, cumulative savings needed for 2006–07 are substantial, and the
authorities should take decisive steps to adopt the corresponding measures. With elections
scheduled in 2006, there is considerable merit to taking early action to secure the
recommended adjustment.
33.
Continued consolidation beyond 2007 is needed to ensure fiscal sustainability in
the face of population aging pressures. Structural balance or a small surplus will be needed
over the long term to shore up the fiscal position ahead of intensifying budget pressures from

- 32 -

population aging. This requires structural reforms in key spending areas. On pensions, the
considerable progress made towards evaluating reform options is welcome, and an early
political consensus on reform is the next priority. Options under consideration imply
significant transitional deficits and it would be prudent to set aside a substantial share of
privatization revenues to finance these deficits. On healthcare, the arrears buildup is
symptomatic of deep-rooted problems and underscores the urgency of reform. Measures need
to include a rationalization of the supply of health services, incentives for providers to
contain costs, greater sharing of the financial burden with final users, and transformation of
health insurance companies from payment agencies into true insurers. On social benefits, as
part of labor market reform, a restructuring of entitlements is needed to reduce welfare traps,
improve incentives to work, and save budget resources.
34.
The complexity of tasks and the institutional weaknesses require a strengthening
of the fiscal framework. Recently introduced budgetary rules on the carryover of spending
by line ministries encouraged more rational spending by ministries but unveiled weaknesses
in budgeting. In addition, these rules weakened the fiscal framework, as carryover spending
is outside the expenditure ceilings. Teeth need to be restored to the fiscal framework for
policy sustainability and credibility. Budgetary control also needs to be improved by
integrating the budget approval process for extrabudgetary funds with the state budget and
extending expenditure ceilings to cover carryover spending and extrabudgetary funds. Also,
the transparency of fiscal policy needs to be enhanced by timely reporting of spending by
extrabudgetary funds, and by consistently using as the targeted fiscal concept the broadest
possible and most commonly used measure of the deficit. The delayed shift to GFSM 2001,
which is close to standardized European fiscal indicators, should be expedited. Strengthening
the fiscal framework along these lines would provide policy credibility and maximize
benefits from improved confidence.
35.
Together with fiscal reform, structural reforms aimed at bolstering the role of
the private sector should raise growth potential. Recent privatizations underscore the
authorities’ intention to reduce the role of the state in the economy, which should be
confirmed by completing the pending privatization in the electricity sector. Avoiding further
transfers of bad assets to the CKA is essential to signal that there will be no new bailouts and
to wind down CKA with a minimum cost to taxpayers. Progress in improving the businesslegal environment has been slow, and the simplification of company registration should be
seen as a first step toward creating a one-stop shop for investors combining company
registration and licensing. The creation of modern bankruptcy procedures—another task that
has been pending for several years—is crucial to enable effective restructuring of poorly
performing companies. The authorities should pursue early approval of an amendment on
bankruptcy procedures for financial institutions, still under consideration in parliament.
36.
With the outlook for inflation low, monetary policy can remain accommodative.
Reducing interest rates in the second half of 2004 and April 2005 was appropriate given the
benign inflation outlook. The trends that gave rise to these decisions are expected to prevail
in the period ahead, and current market and official expectations suggest that inflation is
likely to remain below the 3 percent target through the end of 2006. However, uncertainties

- 33 -

call for a cautious approach to future interest rate changes. Measured in terms of unit labor
costs, competitiveness against trading partners has eroded over the past year, reversing gains
made in 2003. Other factors—including labor quality—appear to have compensated as
demonstrated by the dynamism of exports and growth, but continued growth of unit labor
costs relative to trading partners would be a cause for concern.
37.
The low inflation is a testament to a credible monetary policy. The inflation
targeting framework—by relying primarily on the interest rate instrument rather than foreign
exchange intervention—has provided a transparent and credible foundation for monetary
policy. The CNB has taken welcome steps to improve public communications and thus
clarify its policy intentions and decisions. It would also be helpful to clarify in the Inflation
Report the respective roles of the CNB Board and staff in the elaboration of the forecast.
38.
Rapid growth in lending to households calls for a further strengthening of
financial sector surveillance. The CNB has made significant progress in the analysis of
financial risks. But rapid credit growth exposes households to liquidity and solvency risks
under adverse macroeconomic shocks, and requires closer supervision in an environment of
easy financial conditions. In the event of higher interest rates, banks would be exposed to
dual risks of rising loan defaults and declining collateral prices. Vigilance in this area will
thus require close integration of stress testing with bank supervision, and collecting data on
household’s overall financial position and prices of housing transactions.
39.
Euro adoption can bring considerable economic gains provided the right policies
are in place. Credibly reducing the fiscal deficit below the Maastricht limit and improving
labor market flexibility are key in this regard, with the latter playing a substantial role in
cushioning economic shocks after euro adoption and maintaining competitiveness. Adhering
to the current timetable for euro adoption will require securing an early agreement on the
required policies.
40.
The next Article IV consultation with the Czech Republic is expected to be
conducted under the standard 12-month cycle.

1/ General government gross debt (excluding CKA debt).
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ The 2008 jump in government debt is associated with closing of CKA and taking over its remaining obligations. For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as general government deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
8/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
9/ Assumes that 90 percent of guarantees are called in 2006 and GDP growth stabilizes at 2.5 percent.
10/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
11/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
The currency of the Czech Republic is the Czech koruna, created on
February 8, 1993 upon the dissolution of the currency union with the
Slovak Republic, which had used the Czechoslovak koruna as its currency.
From May 3, 1993 to May 27, 1997, the exchange rate was pegged to a
basket of two currencies: the deutsche mark (65 percent) and the
U.S. dollar (35 percent). On February 28, 1996, the Czech National Bank
widened the exchange rate band from ±0.5 percent to ±7.5 percent around
the central rate. On May 27, 1997, managed floating was introduced. In
the 2004 edition of the Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and
Exchange Restrictions, the de facto exchange rate regime of the Czech
Republic was classified as managed floating with no pre-announced path
for the exchange rate. On June 30, 2005, the exchange rate of the Czech
koruna stood at CZK 24.18 per U.S. dollar.

APPENDIX II

Czech Republic: Statistical Issues
41.
Data on core surveillance variables are available to the Fund regularly and with
minimal lags (reporting to STA is less current, especially for foreign trade and the national
accounts). Exchange rates and interest rates, set by the Czech National Bank (CNB), are
reported daily with no lag. Gross and net international reserves are reported on a monthly
basis with a one-week lag, as well as on a 10-day basis (with the CNB’s balance sheet) with a
one-week lag. Consumer prices, reserve money, broad money, borrowing and lending
interest rates, central government fiscal accounts, and foreign trade are reported monthly with
a lag of between one and four weeks. Final monetary survey data are available with a lag of
about one month. GDP and balance of payments data are made available on a quarterly basis
with a lag of two to three months. Since 2003, the main components of the balance of
payments are also available monthly. Annual data published in the Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook cover all operations of the general government, including the
extrabudgetary funds excluded from the monthly data. These annual data are available on a
timely basis. Monthly fiscal data published in International Financial Statistics (IFS) cover
central and local budget accounts and are available with a two- to three-month lag.

While data quality is generally adequate, some deficiencies remain in certain areas;
the authorities are taking measures to improve data accuracy.
•

National accounts data are subject to certain weaknesses. Value added in the
small-scale private sector is likely to be underestimated, as the mechanisms for data
collection on this sector are not yet fully developed and a significant proportion of
unrecorded activity stems from tax evasion. Discrepancies between GDP estimates
based on the production method and the expenditure method are large and are
subsumed under change in stocks. Quarterly estimates of national accounts are
derived from quarterly reports of enterprises and surveys. The estimates are subject to
bias because of nonresponse (while annual reporting of bookkeeping accounts is
mandatory for enterprises, quarterly reporting is not) and lumping of several
expenditure categories in particular quarters by respondents. Large swings in
individual components of spending and the overall GDP from quarter to quarter also
bring into question the reliability of the quarterly data.

•

Recently, revisions to procedures for processing export data have brought external
trade statistics close to the practice in the EU. However, a continued weakness of
foreign trade statistics is the unavailability of fixed base price indices for exports and
imports; these indices are currently presented on the basis of the same month of the
previous year.

•

Monetary survey data provided to the European Department are generally adequate
for policy purposes. However, large variations in the interbank clearing account float,
especially at the end of the year, require caution in interpreting monetary
developments. The CNB has made a major effort to identify the causes of these
variations and adjust the data. In 2002, to meet EU statistical conventions, the CNB

- 44 -

implemented the European Central Bank’s (ECB) framework for collecting,
compiling, and reporting monetary data. The data published in IFS is based on
monetary accounts derived from the ECB’s framework. The same set of accounts also
forms the basis for monetary statistics published in the CNB’s bulletins and on the
website, which are thereby effectively harmonized with the monetary statistics
published in IFS, although the presentation in IFS differs somewhat from the CNB’s.
•

Annual fiscal data on ESA-95 basis has been prepared by the Czech Statistical Office.
Quarterly data for non-financial accounts have also been compiled and quarterly
financial accounts will be prepared by 2006. The Ministry of Finance uses the ESA95 methodology for the Convergence Program targets. The ESA-95 methodology
differs from the national (fiscal targeting methodology) in terms of the coverage of
the institutions (for example, the CKA is included in the central government under
ESA definition) and inclusion of financial transactions and other accrual items (for
example, called guarantees).

The Czech Republic is in observance of the Special Data Dissemination Standard
(SDDS) and meets the SDDS specifications. Statistical metadata are posted on the Fund’s

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with
the Czech Republic
On August 1, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Czech Republic.1
Background
Recent accession to the EU and gains in growth performance reinforced the Czech Republic’s
position as one of the most open and developed economies among the new member states.
Thanks to substantial foreign direct investment, its manufacturing sector is closely integrated
into cross-border production networks, and foreign-owned firms now account for most of
industrial exports.
Notwithstanding a recent spurt, growth potential remains constrained by impediments to the
geographical mobility of workers, skills mismatches, and weaknesses in the business-legal
environment. Adverse demographic trends presage unsustainable pressures on the budget
and weakening economic prospects. Despite initial steps in some areas and the development
of a medium-term strategy, overall progress in alleviating structural impediments to growth has
been slow. Implementing the requisite policies has become all the more imperative for the
Czech Republic to maintain its relatively favorable position among new member states and
keep pace with quickly catching up peers.
Accession to the EU combined with a cyclical recovery accelerated growth last year. GDP
expanded by 4.4 percent in 2004, with net exports gradually replacing investment as the main
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2source of growth. Household consumption grew only modestly, as lagging employment
weighed on disposable incomes. Unemployment—of which more than half is long-term—
remained at about 8 percent. With favorable terms of trade, an export boom narrowed the
trade deficit. Although appreciation and rising unit labor costs unwound competitiveness gains
achieved in 2003, market shares remained broadly stable.
Despite a pickup in growth, inflation stayed low, as a soft labor market, expanding productive
capacity, and strong productivity growth kept core inflation down. Excluding the effects of
administrative price changes related to EU accession, underlying inflation has risen only
modestly, remaining on average below 2 percent. Headline inflation is about 1½ percent,
below the Czech National Bank (CNB) target band.
The trade deficit narrowed to less than 1 percent of GDP in 2004, turning into a surplus in the
first quarter of 2005. The current account deficit declined to 5¼ percent of GDP, in 2004, with
rising profit and dividend repatriations offsetting the narrower trade deficit. The current account
deficit was largely financed by greenfield and brownfield FDI, which rebounded to 3⅔ of GDP,
despite the lack of major privatizations.
Monetary conditions tightened during 2004, owing to a cumulative 50 basis point increase in
policy interest rates in the summer of 2004 and a 6 percent nominal appreciation of the koruna
against the euro during the year. A strengthening of the koruna led the inflation-targeting CNB
to reassess the inflation outlook and reduce the main policy rate by cumulative 75 basis points
to 1¾ percent by April 2005.
The fiscal deficit declined in 2004. The general government deficit—excluding privatization
receipts and transfers to the Czech Consolidation Agency (CKA) to cover the costs of
managing bad assets—narrowed relative to GDP by about 1¾ percentage point to near 3¼
percent of GDP in 2004. The decline mainly reflected changes in the budgetary rules that
allowed line ministries to carry over unspent allocations to future years, as well as a reduction
in sickness benefits and public employment. Tax revenues remained strong, given a pickup in
growth and harmonization of indirect taxes with the EU. Public debt is still a moderate 24
percent of GDP and can be financed with ease, as the success of the recent Eurobond issues
illustrates.
Banking sector indicators are positive, and bank lending—led by credit to households—
continues to rebound. Past restructuring and improved risk management have strengthened
banks, and the authorities’ stress testing suggests that the banking system is resilient to
moderate macroeconomic shocks. As banks introduced new mortgage and consumer loan
facilities into a largely untapped retail market, bank lending to households has risen at an
annual rate of 20–30 percent for about three years, outpacing lending to corporates by a wide
margin.

-3Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the Czech Republic’s strong economic
performance in the first year of EU membership. Moreover, the near-term outlook has brightened,
in part because significant foreign investments have expanded capacity, lowered inflationary
pressures, and contributed to a robust export performance.
At the same time, Directors noted that the Czech Republic’s continuing attractiveness to foreign
and domestic investors may be affected by rigidities in the labor market and weaknesses in the
business-legal environment. In addition, primary fiscal deficits are large, and population aging
could slow growth and undermine fiscal sustainability. Directors emphasized that sustaining the
good economic performance will require an integrated policy response to these challenges.
Directors considered that robust economic growth offers the authorities the opportunity to
advance the pace of deficit reduction and implement in full the reforms under the medium-term
fiscal adjustment plan. Substantial budgetary savings will be needed to achieve the medium-term
fiscal targets. Directors therefore encouraged the authorities to sustain the consolidation gains
made in 2004 and to approve quickly the expenditure-reducing measures identified for 2006 and
beyond, which would also bolster the credibility of the medium-term plan.
Directors called for a further strengthening of the fiscal framework to address existing institutional
weaknesses and contain the risk of fiscal drift. The budget approval process for extrabudgetary
activities should be integrated with that for the state budget, and expenditure ceilings should be
extended to cover carryover spending and extrabudgetary activities. Enhancing fiscal policy
transparency will require the timely reporting of spending from extrabudgetary funds and a shift to
a comprehensive fiscal definition—preferably the standardized European Union definition.
Directors stressed that, to deflect the adverse effect that population aging is expected to have on
the public finances, ambitious expenditure reforms will be needed to ensure a sound long-term
fiscal position. They welcomed the progress made in evaluating pension reform proposals, and
noted the need to build a political consensus for such a reform. They cautioned that delays in
health care reform and repeated bailouts of health insurance companies increase moral hazard
and raise contingent liabilities for the budget. They saw an urgent need to create incentives for
containing costs and allowing greater burden-sharing of costs with final users.
Directors commended the authorities for having achieved low inflation. The inflation-targeting
framework has gained well-deserved credibility and is a sound anchor for inflationary
expectations. Given the benign inflation outlook, Directors supported the recent interest rate cuts.
Looking ahead, the absence of demand pressures justifies an accommodative monetary policy
stance. However, uncertainties about fiscal policy, in particular, call for a cautious approach to
future interest rate cuts. Directors underscored that, while the Czech Republic’s near-term
competitiveness is not in question, a continued rise in unit labor costs relative to trading partners
would be a cause for concern. Directors welcomed the authorities’ continued policy of nonintervention in the foreign exchange market and their commitment to use the interest rate
instrument to achieve price stability. They also welcomed recent efforts by the Czech National
Bank to improve public communication of its monetary policy decisions, and encouraged it to
seek further refinements.
Directors welcomed the indications of strong banking system soundness and the ongoing
improvements in banking supervision. At the same time, given the rapid increase in credit to
households, continued supervisory vigilance is needed in this sector, including through improved

-4collection of data on household loan portfolios and better evaluation of household loan quality.
Directors also noted the need to promote policies that encourage long-term savings, to prepare
for the demands of an aging population and the expected transfer of financial risks from the public
sector to households.
Directors observed that a more flexible labor market will be needed to deal with the implications
of the decline in the number of active labor market participants as the population ages. Greater
flexibility will also be important given that the labor market will have to play a larger role in
cushioning economic shocks after the euro is adopted. Directors called on the authorities to
speed up the adoption of legislation to tighten benefit entitlements, encourage retraining, and
increase geographical mobility. They particularly encouraged the authorities to focus on reforming
the social benefit system to reduce disincentives to work and increase labor force participation.
Efforts to improve the quality of education, as well as research and development activities, will
also be important.
Directors considered that bolstering the role of the private sector would be key for raising
productivity in the economy and long-term growth. They welcomed the resumption of
privatization, but noted that slow reforms of bankruptcy procedures hinder the restructuring of
poorly performing enterprises. They urged swift approval of new bankruptcy legislation.
Directors felt that euro adoption can bring considerable economic gains provided that the
appropriate flexibility of the economy is achieved and the right policies are in place. They
stressed that adhering to the current timetable for euro adoption will require securing an early
agreement on, and building public support for, sustainable fiscal consolidation and structural
reforms.
