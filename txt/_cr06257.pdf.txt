EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
In 2005, reflecting high oil prices and production, both the fiscal and external current account balances are
estimated to have registered large surpluses. Real GDP growth is estimated at 8.5 percent, with an estimated
11 percent growth in nonhydrocarbon sector and 2.1 percent growth in hydrocarbon GDP. Inflation as measured
by the consumer price index is estimated to have reached 8 percent.
Financial market developments were underpinned by abundant liquidity and booming asset markets. The equity
markets, however, after having risen significantly since 2004, saw a sharp correction since their peaks in
November 2005. Banks’ profits increased substantially in 2005, mostly due to the sector’s considerable
involvement in the IPO and equity markets and the booming real estate sector. Capital adequacy ratio of banks
remained high and the ratio of nonperforming loans declined.
Medium-term Context
Underpinned by current expectations that world oil prices will remain high and oil production will increase
steadily to 3.5 million barrels per day by 2011, the medium-term outlook remains favorable. Although the
downside risks to the projected outlook from a drop in oil prices are limited, there are risks that warrant close
monitoring, particularly, asset price developments in the equity and real estate markets and accelerating
inflationary pressures.
Staff Appraisal
The authorities’ primary objective should be to ensure that economic expansion proceeds at a sustainable pace
while maintaining macroeconomic stability. The recent sharp correction in equity prices and the increase in
domestic interest rates are expected to dampen domestic demand. However, most likely, this slowdown will be
offset by the planned large increase in public sector investment.
The large increase in social and infrastructure expenditure envisaged by the authorities is broadly appropriate,
provided that it is balanced with the underlying risk factors. The comfortable fiscal position and the significant
accumulation of financial assets argue for higher infrastructure and social spending to support the broadening of
growth and increase the absorptive capacity of the economy. However, if the rapid increase in private sector
credit and consequent inflationary pressures continue in 2006, it will be necessary to tighten financial policies,
including reassessing public expenditure plans.
There is a need for better fiscal policy coordination among the emirates and the federal government. Wage
increases in the public sector should be increasingly linked to productivity and the revenue base could be
broadened by introducing a VAT system at the federal level.
The responsibilities of the different entities involved in regulating the capital markets and its participants should
be clearly defined. Close coordination among these entities is needed to ensure that a comprehensive
supervisory framework for the entire financial sector is in place. IPO prices should be set by the market through
professional underwriters based on appropriate valuations of the companies and not by the Ministry of
Economy.
The exchange rate peg has served the U.A.E. well, but the choice of the exchange rate regime under the planned
Gulf Cooperation Council monetary union remains open.
The numerous structural weaknesses with respect to data quality need to be addressed urgently. Given the
planned increase in borrowing by local governments’ entities, it is crucial that data on domestic and external
debt be compiled.

-4-

I. BACKGROUND
1.
An outward-oriented development strategy and prudent financial policies have
resulted in impressive economic growth over the years and led to a large accumulation
of external financial assets. This success has been underpinned by Abu Dhabi’s prudent
management of its oil wealth and Dubai’s strong push for economic diversification. All
indications point to the fact that the liberal economic policies the U.A.E. has followed thus
far will be broadened and accelerated in the period ahead.1
2.
The major emirates (Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Sharjah) intend to leverage the
favorable economic environment to carry out reforms that will foster more private
sector participation.2 Dubai passed a property law which allows 100 percent foreign
ownership of properties in pre-designated areas, while working with the private sector to
provide infrastructure and other services that are traditionally provided and financed by the
public sector. Sharjah has established a number of industrial free zones and also benefited
from attracting new small and medium-sized enterprises that are rapidly expanding. Abu
Dhabi has embraced utility privatization, rationalized its fiscal policy through outsourcing of
public expenditure, and has recently announced a very ambitious medium-term development
plan that will be carried out jointly with the private sector.
3.
The rapid growth of the capital markets and the significant increase in capital
inflows have made the inter-linkages between the financial and real sectors more
complex. Therefore, broad and proper information collection is needed to allow
comprehensive and timely monitoring of economic developments.
4.
In recent years, the Fund’s policy advice has encouraged the authorities to
strengthen fiscal policy and modernize the financial sector’s legal framework and
improve capital markets supervision and regulations.3 The decentralized policymaking
process and the complexity of the U.A.E.’s economic and political structure have made it
difficult for the authorities to implement the Fund’s fiscal policy recommendations. In
contrast, progress has been made in financial sector reforms, as the Central Bank of the
U.A.E. (CBU) has authority over most institutions in the sector.
5.
Limited improvements have been made in the U.A.E.’s economic and social
statistics. Data shortcomings (discussed in Appendix III) continue to impose serious
constraints on economic monitoring, analysis, and policy formulation and staff has
recommended that data deficiencies across sectors be addressed urgently.
1

During the past 15 months, new rulers in Abu Dhabi and Dubai were appointed.

The U.A.E. is a confederation of seven emirates each operating under considerable autonomy. The seven
emirates are Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Ras al-Khaimah, Umm al-Qaiwain, and Fujairah.

II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
6.
The consultation discussions were held against a backdrop of strong economic
activity, high oil prices, and large fiscal and external surpluses. Also, abundant liquidity
and unconventional IPO pricing have fueled a surge in equity prices. The equity markets,
however, have experienced a sharp correction since their peaks in November 2005.
Nonetheless, economic fundamentals continue to be strong, bolstered by the large
accumulation of financial surpluses and the surge in foreign direct investment (FDI) in
Dubai.
7.
The growth in money supply and credit expansion were substantial in 2005.
Wages in almost all sectors of the economy have risen and further increases are expected.
Also, prices of non-tradable goods and services have increased significantly. Although data
is not available, it is reported that real estate prices have increased significantly since 2004,
particularly in Dubai.
Real Sector
8.
Real nonhydrocarbon GDP growth
for 2004 has been revised upward to
12.6 percent from 10 percent, indicating
stronger overall growth than previously
estimated.4 For 2005, real nonhydrocarbon
growth is estimated to have been 11 percent.5
Growth was broad-based and most sub-sectors
grew at historically high rates. The
hydrocarbon sector registered a growth rate of
2.1 percent (Table 1).

9.
The strong growth in domestic demand has been accompanied by rising
inflation. For 2005, official preliminary estimates (which were hampered by the lack of data
collection on various prices) indicate CPI inflation at about 6 percent, significantly lower
than recent market estimates. 6 However, with price developments of non-tradables like rents
4

During last year’s consultation, real nonhydrocarbon GDP growth rates for 2002 and 2003 were also revised
upward by an average of 4.2 percentage points to 7.7 percent and 11.2 percent, respectively.
5

At the time of the mission, the authorities estimate for real nonhydrocarbon GDP was 6.2 percent. Since then,
it has been revised upward to 10.8 percent.

6

According to estimates in recent market reports, CPI inflation in 2005 was above 15 percent. A number of
shortcomings exist with respect to the methodology used to compile the CPI, including: outdated weights, lack
of imputations for missing data; and different reference periods for the base price and expenditure weights. The
authorities do not compile information relating to producer prices. The CBU is currently coordinating with the
Ministry of Economy (MOE) on how to proceed with their request for a TA mission on CPI from the Fund.

-6-

and services, and large increases in the money supply (34 percent) and in petroleum prices
(31 percent), staff estimates inflation at about 8 percent, though this may be higher. During
2003–05, reflecting the significantly higher non-oil GDP growth, the U.A.E.’s average
annual inflation rate was more than twice that of the other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
countries.

External Sector
10.
The sharp rise in oil prices and
strong growth in nonhydrocarbon
exports contributed to a large external
current account surplus in 2005 (about
14.5 percent of GDP). The level of activity
in the free zones continued to expand with
the emirate of Dubai playing an
increasingly important role as the point of
entry into the GCC region. Reflecting
strong domestic demand in the U.A.E.,
imports increased by 27 percent to about
$81 billion. FDI inflow remained strong
and is estimated to have reached $11 billion

Fiscal Sector
11.
The budgetary system of the U.A.E. and weaknesses in fiscal data have
continued to impede a timely and accurate assessment of overall fiscal developments.
With lack of uniformity in the classification of expenditures and revenues among the seven
emirates and the federal government, the unavailability of data on the government’s
investment income, and considerable off-budget spending, a comprehensive analysis of the

-7-

fiscal developments remains difficult. Nevertheless, the availability of data on net
accumulation of government foreign assets and domestic financing allowed the staff to
estimate the overall fiscal balance from the financing side.
12.
In 2005, Abu Dhabi’s budget improved markedly due to high oil prices and
moderate expenditure increases. Expenditures grew by only 8 percent largely due to the
outsourcing of some services previously provided by the municipality to the private sector.
The sectors that were largely transferred off-budget include housing and community center
programs and general administration. As a result, the work force was reduced by about 8,000
workers (14.5 percent) and, despite a 25 percent and 15 percent increase in the salaries of
nationals and expatriates, the wage bill declined.7 The government of Abu Dhabi contributed
AED 6.2 billion to its pension fund from privatization receipts.
The two other key emirates,
Dubai and Sharjah, maintained their
policy of executing budgets that are
largely in balance. However, Dubai’s
budget does not provide a comprehensive
picture of its fiscal accounts. Considerable
fiscal operations continue to be carried
outside the budget, and information about
these operations is currently not
available.8 The consolidated fiscal surplus
of the federal government and the three
largest emirates is estimated to have
reached about 27 percent of GDP in 2005
(Table 3).

The federal government has implemented a number of measures to improve
public administration reforms. These measures include: (i) budget classification consistent
with the 2001 Government Finance Statistics; (ii) moves toward a single treasury account;
and (iii) establishment of a new accounting framework. Progress in these basic areas has
been commendable, and should help in greater transparency in federal government
operations. However, the budget law, while an improvement over previous versions, does not
create the needed incentives and measures to induce the ministries to use performance
budgeting judiciously.

Analysis of fiscal developments in Abu Dhabi has been complicated by the ongoing restructuring of its
budget.

The Dubai government owns a number of public entities, such as, Dubai Ports World, Emirates Airlines, and
Dubai Aluminum Company (DUBAL) which the staff has limited information on their financial operations.

The emirates have significant autonomy from the federation. With its sizable hydrocarbon holdings,
the emirate of Abu Dhabi accounts for about 65 percent and 80 percent of the U.A.E.’s expenditures and
revenues, respectively. Dubai with its dwindling revenues from oil and gas and a growing population,

The emirate of Abu Dhabi has created a development arm, Mubadala, to be responsible for its
investments in a wide range of strategic sectors including energy, real estate, and health care.
The federal government, although smaller in size relative to Abu Dhabi, plays an important role in
the federation and often leads in public administration reforms. It provides basic social services
across the country, sets regulations and minimum standards, and represents the U.A.E.’s interests in
international affairs.
Overall, the public sector across the U.A.E. is undergoing a major shift to restructure and
outsource many activities to the private sector. Planned development expenditures over the next
5 years are estimated at over $350 billion, a significant part of which will be shouldered by the private
sector.

In the aftermath of the decline in the regional equity markets that started in late
2005, the direction of capital flows reversed in the first 2 months of 2006. Net foreign
assets of the banking system declined by about AED 30 billion, as regional investors reduced
their exposure to the U.A.E. markets. However, claims on the private sector increased by
13 percent, while broad money grew by 2.3 percent.
Financial Sector Developments10
17.
Banks’ exposure to the booming real estate sector and equity markets (Box 2)
increased substantially.11 As a percent of total credit, lending to construction increased by 2
percentage points to 12 percent and direct lending to the equity markets increased by 5
percentage points to 6 percent. However, indirect lending to the equity markets through
personal loans could be even higher. Some banks have reportedly leveraged investments in
excess of the permitted bank margin lending ratio of 5 to 1.
18.
The stock of nonperforming loans (NPLs) increased by 2.4 percent in 2005.
However, reflecting the significant growth in credit, the ratio of NPLs to total loans declined
to 8.3 percent from 12.5 percent in 2004 (Table 5). Also, provisions were considerable,

In line with international standards, the authorities removed the deposits of U.A.E. residents in overseas

bringing net NPLs ratio to total loans below 2 percent. The capital assets ratio remained high
at 17.4 percent and banks’ balance sheet increased by 40 percent to AED 608.5 billion (about
$166 billion). On an aggregate basis, banks complied with the CBU’s prudential norms.12
19.
Banks’ profits more than doubled to $5.1 billion in 2005. Non-interest income,
which increased by over 112 percent, accounted for about one third of total banks’ income.
Most of this increase was driven by fees and commissions on IPO subscriptions, and income
generated from banks’ investment in the equity market. Receipt of deposits for IPOs also
provided the banks with ample non-interest-bearing cash for considerable periods of time.
20.
Considerable progress has been made with respect to the regulatory framework
governing the Dubai International Financial Center (DIFC), and an extensive set of
laws have been enacted, benchmarked to best international practices. While as of midFebruary 2006, 160 companies and 40 financial institutions have been granted licenses to
operate within the free zone, the actual volume of business conducted at DIFC is still
relatively small.

The staff was not in a position to assess individual banks compliance with prudential norms.

Box 2. U.A.E.: Capital Markets: Recent Developments and Key Characteristics
Capital markets in the U.A.E. have posted
strong growth in 2005, driven by ample
liquidity, strong macroeconomic growth, low
interest rates, and strong corporate
performance. The Dubai Financial Market
(DFM) and Abu Dhabi Securities Market
(ADSM) indices gained 132 percent and
69 percent, respectively, in 2005. The overall
U.A.E. market led the region’s capital markets in
terms of both market capitalization, and market
activities, including volume and value of share
traded. The U.A.E. also led the region in terms of
the largest number of IPOs (11).

III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
The policy discussions centered on the economic outlook and the underlying risk factors;
fiscal policy coordination between the federal and emirates’ governments and public finance
reform; monetary policy and assets price inflation; structural and labor policies; and
exchange rate policy. Banks’ exposure to the equity and real estate markets, underpricing of
IPOs, and the need to put in place a comprehensive supervisory framework to address the
rapidly growing financial sector were also discussed. The structural weaknesses in the
U.A.E.’s statistical database were highlighted.
A. Near- and Medium-Term Outlook
21.
Economic growth is projected to remain buoyant in 2006, with real
nonhydrocarbon activity largely expected to remain high and oil production rising
significantly. Several large scale real estate and infrastructure projects in Dubai and Abu
Dhabi are already in the pipeline as part of each emirates’ economic diversification strategy.
In the hydrocarbon sector, ambitious plans to expand capacity are expected to result in higher
oil production in 2006. However, the recent sharp correction in equity markets and the
increase in domestic interest rates, in line with the U.S. dollar rates, are expected to dampen
domestic demand. On the inflation front, the stabilization of rental costs (Dubai has a
15 percent cap on rental increases until end-2006) and the wearing-off of the impact of the
fuel price hike in 2005 could act as a balancing factor.
22.
The medium-term outlook remains favorable, underpinned by current expectations
that world oil prices will remain high,13 oil production will increase steadily to 3.5 million
barrels per day by 2011, and the nonhydrocarbon sector will gain further traction from the
diversification strategy. Real nonhydrocarbon growth is projected to settle at a more
sustainable pace of 6.5–7.0 percent during 2007–11. Both the external current account and
the overall fiscal surpluses are projected to remain sizeable.

13

In line with the April 2006 WEO projections, oil prices are projected to remain high and decline only
marginally to an average of $67.3 during 2006–11.

units expected to come on the market
by early 2007 could put downward pressure on prices in this sector.
B. Macroeconomic Policies
Fiscal Policy and Public Finance Reforms
24.
Fiscal policy discussions were conducted separately at the federal level and with
the largest three emirates, and focused on Abu Dhabi’s fiscal policy stance and the public
administration reforms of the federal government. Reforms of key issues such as reducing
subsidies on water and electricity in Abu Dhabi, widening the tax base on a federation-wide
scale, improving fiscal data coverage, and fiscal policy coordination between the emirates
and the federal government were also discussed.
25.
The emirate of Abu Dhabi plans to continue to outsource most of its non-core
budgetary activities and reduce the size of its government. It is expected that an
additional 20,000 jobs will be outsourced to the private sector in 2006, resulting in a
significant reduction (about 40 percent) in its public work force. The authorities also intend
to eliminate agricultural subsides by 2008. Plans are underway to have the private sector play
a bigger role in the management and provision of power generation and health care.
26.
Overall coordination between the federal and emirates’ governments remains
weak. Each emirate continues to implement its fiscal policy independently with little
consideration to overall macroeconomic implications. To improve overall fiscal assessment
and analysis, officials at the federal and emirates’ level agreed that there is a need to improve
fiscal transparency by adopting international standards of classification for expenditure and
revenue statistics. The Ministry of Finance and Industry has asked for an advisor from the
14

Staff estimates that for each $1 drop in the price of a barrel of oil, on average, the fiscal balance will weaken
by only about 0.5 percent of GDP during 2006–11.

- 14 -

Fund to help it set up a macro-fiscal unit at the ministry. The aim of this unit is to develop a
consistent macroeconomic framework and the capacity to provide advice on economic and
financial policies.
27.
The broadening of the revenue base will largely be driven by the prospective
adoption of a VAT in the context of the GCC monetary union. Regarding FAD’s
recommendations for the introduction of the VAT, the authorities at the federal government
indicated that their implementation will await a GCC ministerial decision to introduce such a
tax in all the six countries.
28.
On the expenditure side, there is a need to reduce subsidies on water and
electricity gradually and to replace them by targeted payments to nationals below a
certain income. Also, the General Pension and Social Security System (GPSSA) needs a
major overhaul as it suffers from structural imbalances due to the overly generous benefits.
The actuarial study by the GPSSA that is to be completed soon would be useful in
developing an overall reform strategy.
29.
The authorities are planning to increase development expenditures significantly
in 2006 and over the medium-term. Key government entities (such as the Abu Dhabi
National Oil Company, Dubai Ports Authority, and Dubai Aluminum Company (DUBAL))
have massive investment plans to further increase the capacity of upstream activities in the
petrochemicals sector, infrastructure in airports and ports, and new manufacturing plants in
the metals sector. Over the medium-term, the total investment in Dubai is conservatively
estimated at $200 billion. Similarly, about $160 billion worth of projects are planned for
Abu Dhabi (Box 3). A major $25 billion investment plan for upgrading both upstream and
downstream production capacity is underway in Abu Dhabi. Oil production capacity is
planned for expansion from 2.9 million barrels to 3.5 million barrels per day within the next
five to seven years. Also, in 2006, the federal government development expenditures are
projected to increase by ten fold on health and education and by 400 percent on public
housing.

- 15 -

Box 3. U.A.E.: Planned Investment Projects: 2006–11
The U.A.E. is currently undertaking a massive broad-based investment plan to further diversify
the economy and increase oil production over the medium and long run. Dubai is leading the
investment drive in the real estate and the infrastructure sector. Among the projects that have been
announced are the expansion of the Dubai International Airport ($4 billion), Palm Jumeirah ($5 billion),
Palm Jebel Ali ($7.5 billion), Palm Deira ($12.5 billion), Dubai light rail transport project ($3 billion),
Jebel Ali Airport city ($20 billion), Dubai Land ($10 billion), Dubai Aerospace Enterprise ($15 billion),
Emirates Pearl ($9.5 billion), and investments in utilities ($15 billion) and roads ($5 billion). Similarly, a
number of projects are planned for Abu Dhabi including a new port ($2.5 billion), airport expansion
($5.7 billion), several large real estate projects, and a joint venture between DUBAL and Mubadala.
In Abu Dhabi, massive investments in natural gas production and infrastructure will—in
combination with gas imports from Qatar—satisfy the country’s rapidly rising domestic gas demand (for
electricity generation and petrochemical feedstock) and create new potential for the exportation of
condensates and natural gas liquids. Development of Abu Dhabi’s petrochemicals sector is being
accelerated through investment plans to produce ethylene, polyethylene, and other products.
Part of the planned projects in Dubai will be carried out by Dubai Holding which is a privately
held company owned by the Ruler of Dubai. It is a conglomerate of 66 companies that operate within
7 clusters, which comprise of real estate investments in Dubai, international properties, equities,
telecommunication, hotels, and properties in industrial city, health city and a theme park. It has an
aggressive growth strategy and is pursuing investment opportunities both domestically and
internationally. Various real estate projects in the Middle East and North Africa are in the pipeline and it
is also looking to increase its investments via private equity deals in Asia, especially in China and India.

Monetary Policy and the Financial Sector15
30.
In the context of the fixed exchange rate system and full capital account
convertibility the effectiveness of monetary policy is quite limited. The recent sizeable
capital outflow in the first 2 months of 2006 appears to have tightened monetary conditions
somewhat. Nonetheless, given the scale of real estate and infrastructure projects under
consideration, this tightening could be a temporary phenomenon.
31.
In the event of continued strong economic performance and a sustained pace of
high credit growth to the private sector, a tightening of monetary conditions is
warranted to stem inflationary pressures. This could be achieved by raising reserve
requirements on demand deposits, introducing tighter prudential norms for both banks and
non-bank financial institutions, including tightening of margin lending, collateral valuation
and provisioning requirements; and increase in certain risk weights for capital calculations. A
gradual lowering of the percent at which individuals can borrow against their salaries could

15

Capital markets key recommendations are discussed in Box 4.

- 16 -

also be considered.16 The authorities indicated that they are considering these
recommendations.
32.
Credit risk is the most important risk factor in the banking sector at this time.
Increased concentration of bank loans to a few large business groups that dominate the
economy calls for close monitoring. While the CBU limit to a single borrower is appropriate,
considerations may be given to reducing the limit on total large exposures, which is currently
set at 8 times the capital base. The CBU needs to start including off-balance sheet items and
interbank exposures of the U.A.E. banks with a maturity of less than 12 months in the
definition of large exposures.

16

In the U.A.E., individuals can borrow up to 40 percent of their salaries.

- 17 -

Box 4. U.A.E.: Capital Markets: Recommendations for Reforms1
•

There is a need to amend the Company Law with respect to the pricing of IPOs. Subscription
prices for new offerings should be set by the market through professional underwriters based on
appropriate company valuation. Also, intervention (if any) in pricing of subsequent offerings by
currently listed companies should be restricted to a limit on the discount of the market price.

•

The current CBU system, which sets multiple margin rates for the same publicly traded security
based on the nature of the loan, should be replaced by a single rate for each class of securities.
The risk in the value of the collateral varies based on the nature of the collateral, not the loan for
which it is pledged. The staff recommends that the maximum loan value that can be given for most
liquid traded stocks be set at 50 percent, similar to the margin rate provided in major international
markets.

•

There is an urgent need to define the responsibilities of the various entities involved in
regulating the capital markets and its participants, and addressing gaps in regulations in order to
safeguard investor interests. In particular, the law should give the regulatory authorities clear powers
to set and enforce comprehensive prospectus requirements and corporate governance standards for
public companies.

•

There is a need to increase the size of the public float of securities to promote deeper and more
liquid markets. The pre-emptive rights of existing shareholders to subscribe pro-rata on new issue
reduces the opportunity for wider ownership of these companies.

•

There is a need to increase the size of institutional investors in the securities markets. Also, the
equity markets would benefit from the introduction of market stabilization mechanisms, such as
market maker system and hedging instruments that can provide liquidity and allow investors to
manage their risks more effectively.

•

Collection and dissemination of statistical information regarding the assets and the functions of
non-bank financial intermediaries, including mutual funds, investment companies, and brokerage
firms will need to be improved considerably.

•

There is a need for a comprehensive assessment of the capital markets regime against the
standards set by the International Organization of Securities Commissions. Conducting an
assessment of the DIFC at the same time as for the rest of the U.A.E. has merit, despite the relatively
recent establishment of the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA), because regulatory
coordination, overlap and gap issues will be easier to identify.

______________________________
1

A detailed description of the recommendations can be found in Appendix IV.

C. Structural and Labor Policies
33.
The broadening of FDI opportunities in the free zones in Dubai is a welcome
development, but there is a need to pass the new Company Law that includes higher foreign
ownership thresholds. The authorities noted that the U.A.E. is amending the Commercial

- 18 -

Company Law, applicable across the federation, which may see the ceiling on foreign
ownership raised from the current 49 percent.
34.
Wage increases might be exceeding that of productivity gains. The average
20 percent increase in wages in 2005, the significant increase in the prices of non-tradable
goods and services, and some infrastructural bottlenecks that are appearing in the economy
could impact the competitiveness of the non-oil economy.
35.
So far, most of the jobs in the private sector have been filled by expatriate
workers, with the majority of nationals continuing to seek employment in the public
sector. In recent years, the authorities have implemented a string of new measures to
increase the costs associated with hiring expatriate workers. At the same time, they applied a
wide-range of quotas to increase the employment of nationals in the different economic
sectors. It is critical that changes to labor policy do not adversely impact the competitiveness
of the economy.17 Employment opportunities for nationals will need to be created through
long-term structural policies in the areas of education, training, wage policy, and labor
legislation. A new labor law that is expected to be passed by year-end grants workers the
rights to peacefully assemble and to form trade unions.
D. External Sector
36.
The authorities stressed that the pegged exchange rate regime has served the
U.A.E. economy well by providing a nominal anchor and strengthening confidence in its
economic policy. While the equilibrium real exchange rate may have appreciated due to the
positive terms-of-trade shock resulting from higher oil prices, the authorities do not foresee a
change in the exchange rate policy in the period leading up to the planned establishment of
the GCC monetary union by 2010. At that point, however, all options would remain open
regarding the exchange rate regime under the monetary union.
37.
Reflecting developments in the
dollar exchange rate, and
notwithstanding the depreciation
observed during 2002-04, the real
effective exchange rate (REER) has
appreciated by about 25 percent since
1990. Until recently, the cumulative
appreciation of the U.A.E. dirham did
not seem to have eroded the country’s
competitiveness, because productivity
gains appeared to have kept up with

appreciation. However, competitiveness of the non-oil economy may come under pressure if
productivity gains do not keep up with wage increases and if inflationary pressures are not
contained. The private sector believes that wage increases are exceeding productivity gains.
38.
Continued coordination among the GCC countries ahead of the envisaged
monetary union is ongoing. In the area of legislation, GCC countries have agreed on a
common trademark law and are working on common anti-dumping and subsidies legislation.
Deliberations are continuing on the necessary institutional and legal changes needed for the
monetary union. In the trade policy area, at the GCC level, a free trade agreement (FTA) with
the EU is in the final stages of negotiation and is expected to be signed during 2006.
Negotiations on other FTAs are also underway with a number of countries. On a bilateral
basis, the U.A.E. is negotiating a FTA with the United States. The authorities indicated that
in the future all FTAs would be negotiated at the GCC level.
IV. STATISTICAL ISSUES
39.
The U.A.E.’s economic statistics continue to suffer from numerous structural
weaknesses with respect to data quality, coverage, periodicity, timeliness, and intersectoral consistency. As noted, shortcomings are particularly serious in the fiscal area. Data
compilation and reporting are hampered by a shortage of trained staff and poor coordination
within and between the emirates and federal government agencies.
40.
There is an urgent need to develop an effective program of reforms to
strengthen the institutional framework and build-up a strong, comprehensive, and
consistent statistical system. Currently, there is an absence of such a system although most
institutions are beginning to recognize its importance, especially given that the emirates, like
Dubai, are interested in getting a credit rating. Also, it is crucial that data on off-budget fiscal
operations and on domestic and external debt at the emirate level be compiled. The
authorities are urged to finalize the GDDS metadata and nominate a GDDS coordinator.
41.
Officials at the MOE pointed out that the population census has been completed
and its results will be published in 2006. They also indicated that the household budget and
the business establishment surveys are expected to be completed by end-2006 and that a
number of experts were hired to strengthen statistical capacity at the ministry. These
measures are welcome, but the fast evolving structure of the U.A.E. economy, its increasing
linkages to the international capital markets, and the planned GCC-wide monetary union by
2010 require a comprehensive plan to address data weaknesses in most economic sectors.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
42.
The U.A.E. is capitalizing on the gains from high oil prices and from the
transformation of Dubai as a regional hub for trade, commerce and finance. Stronger
economic fundamentals and a pro-business approach to economic management is resulting in
high levels of domestic and foreign investment in the manufacturing, services, and real estate
sectors. These dynamics bode well for the economy’s medium-term growth prospects.

- 20 -

43.
The fast evolving structure of the economy, however, has the potential to create
vulnerabilities. The growth in the capital markets has fostered the expansion of various
types of financial institutions and financial instruments along with a significant increase in
capital flows. In the period ahead, it is expected that significant borrowing by state-owned
entities and governments like Dubai will take place. The absence of comprehensive data on
such activities precludes a meaningful assessment of these projects and could mask any
vulnerabilities that might develop.
44.
The large increase in social and infrastructure expenditure envisaged by the
authorities is broadly appropriate, provided that it is balanced with the underlying risk
factors. The comfortable fiscal position and the significant accumulation of financial assets
argue for higher infrastructure and social spending to support the broadening of growth and
increase the absorptive capacity of the economy. That said, the fiscal stance should be
commensurate with the absorptive capacity of the economy and maintaining macroeconomic
stability.
45.
The authorities are urged to monitor inflation, credit growth, and asset price
developments and adjust policy accordingly. If the rapid increase in private sector credit
and inflationary pressure persist in 2006 and beyond, financial policies will have to be
tightened. Because of the limitations of monetary policy, much of the burden of adjustment
will fall on public spending.
46.
To improve the effectiveness of fiscal policy there is need to improve fiscal policy
coordination among the emirates and the federal government. The economic planning
committee that was formed last year could play a more active role to improve such
coordination. Assessment of overall fiscal developments continue to be handicapped by the
considerable off-budget fiscal operations at the emirates level, particularly, in Dubai.
47.
On the expenditure side, wage increases in the public sector should be
increasingly linked to productivity and subsidies on water and electricity should be phased
out and replaced by targeted payments to nationals below a certain income. Also, it is
strongly recommended that the authorities introduce legislation to reform the General
Pension and Social Security System while it is running operational surpluses. On the revenue
side, the authorities could start the preparatory work based on FAD’s recommendations for
the introduction of a VAT system at the federal level.
48.
The U.A.E. banking system is strong and effectively supervised. However,
increased lending for real estate and equity financing has led to a rise in credit risk. Banks'
direct and indirect exposure to these markets and the increased loan concentration to a few
large business groups call for close monitoring by the CBU, and the adequacy of prudential
regulation should be kept under review. A close supervision of banks that recorded
significant growth in profits from equity markets related activities is particularly needed.
49.
The regulatory structure of the capital markets and intermediary activities are
potential sources of fragility in the financial sector. Many parts of the relevant legal

- 21 -

regime governing securities markets activities in the U.A.E. need to be updated. The
authorities are urged to address the gaps in the regulation of the markets and their
participants and rationalize the extensive overlaps in responsibilities.
50.
Appropriate pricing of IPOs will reduce market volatility and dampen
unreasonable profit expectations on the part of retail investors. Also, current
consideration to ration subscription allotments will no longer be necessary once IPOs have
been priced appropriately and according to the true value of the issuing company. The
authorities are urged to only permit IPOs for companies that have had audited balance sheets
for at least two years.
51.
The staff welcomes the authorities’ agreement for a full assessment of the capital
markets regime in the U.A.E. against the standards set by the International
Organization of Securities Commissions. Also, officials at the DIFC agreed to an
assessment of the DIFC’s legal regime and of the operations of the Dubai Financial Service
Authority. A mission for that purpose could take place before year-end.
52.
The staff concurs with the authorities that the pegged exchange rate regime has
served the U.A.E. economy well and welcomes their position to remain open to the choice
of the exchange rate regime under the planned monetary union. Since other exchange rate
regimes with more flexibility would require greater institutional development, including in
foreign exchange markets and risk management and intervention policies, staff urges the
authorities to begin to formulate strategies to develop these areas at an early stage to keep
their options open.
53.
There is an urgent need to improve the collection, compilation, and reporting of
fiscal, national accounts, balance of payments, and price statistics (monthly CPI). It will
be important to finalize the GDDS metadata and to formally nominate a GDDS coordinator.
While core data provision is adequate for overall surveillance purposes, data shortcomings
have significantly affected the staff's analysis of some key issues in areas central to
surveillance.
54.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

The staff has sought clarification with the authorities whether they intend to notify under Executive Board
Decision 144, measures taken in line with U.N. Security Council resolutions against terrorist financing (e.g.,
1373), as these measures may give rise to exchange restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction. The staff is also
awaiting a notification from the authorities regarding whether restrictions on transactions with the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) pursuant to resolutions of the U.N. Security Council have
been lifted.

APPENDIX II

United Arab Emirates: Relations with the World Bank Group
As of April 30, 2006
•

A Framework Agreement for annual technical cooperation programs was signed in
1994. It replaced the previous arrangement based on ad-hoc requests. The first
Annual Work Program of 1995–96 included two main studies—a Comprehensive
Health Assessment Study and a study to restructure Government Information
Authority, the Government’s computer center.

•

Education sector, recruitment and welfare. Three projects in these areas were
completed in 2000: Public Expenditure Review for the Education Sector; Review and
Assessment of Recruitment Procedures for the Federal government; and Analysis of
Distribution of Welfare in Abu Dhabi.

•

Environmental Assessment. In August of 2003, the U.A.E showed interest in Bank
support for a U.A.E.-wide environmental assessment. A Bank needs-assessment
mission visited Dubai early this year to develop the project concept.

•

Investment Climate. In response to a request from the advisor to the Crown Prince
of Ras Al Khaimah (RAK) for assistance in the area of Foreign Investment and
Economic Development, a World Bank mission visited the emirate in late February
2004. Following discussion in RAK, the Bank team prepared TORs for the first of a
four-phase program, and an agreement was signed in late March. The second phase
consisting in an assessment of the investment climate in RAK was followed by an
Investors’ Promotion Conference in May 27–28, 2005 to increase awareness that this
emirate could quickly develop as a serious contender for investment destination.

APPENDIX III

United Arab Emirates: Statistical Issues
1.
While data provision to the Fund is adequate for overall surveillance purposes, data
shortcomings have significantly affected the staff’s analysis of some key issues in areas
central to surveillance. Numerous shortcomings in the U.A.E.’s economic and financial data
reflect inadequate compilation techniques, infrequent data reporting, shortage of trained staff,
insufficient resources assigned to data gathering, and poor information flow between Federal
and Emirate governments and public sector entities. As a result, provision of data to the Fund
between missions remains poor, except for monetary and fragmentary trade statistics. In
addition, the frequency of official statistics is inadequate—most data are produced only on an
annual basis.
2.
The U.A.E. has received several STA technical assistance missions over the past
decade. The 2003 STA multisector statistics mission concluded that, while the methodology
used to compile macroeconomic statistics is generally appropriate, serious deficiencies exist
in most sectors.1 These are attributable to the lack of sufficient and regular data sources in
the real sector; inadequate coordination among the data compiling agencies; and constraints
from distribution of personnel and financial resources between the Federal government and
the largest Emirates. In response to the authorities’ interest in participating in the General
Data Dissemination System (GDDS), the 2003 mission worked with U.A.E. officials to
prepare draft GDDS metadata. Due to the delay in appointing a GDDS coordinator, updates
of the 2003 metadata will be required for GDDS participation. The U.A.E. hosted a GDDS
workshop in Abu Dhabi during February 27–March 9, 2005.
Real sector
3.
The Ministry of Economy (MOE) compiles an annual CPI, which is disseminated
three months after the end of the reference year. A number of shortcomings exist with respect
to the methodology of the CPI, including: (i) outdated weights that are not representative of
all geographic regions; (ii) no imputations are made for missing price data; (iii) replacement
product prices are not adjusted for changes in quality; and (iv) base price and expenditure
weights refer to different periods. The MOE, in coordination with the Central Bank has plans
to improve the compilation and frequency of the CPI. The MOE does not currently compile a
producer price index, an import price or an export price index, which is a significant
deficiency, given the role of the oil sector in the U.A.E.
4.
The MOE compiles and disseminates annual estimates of gross domestic product
(GDP) by production and expenditure approach in current and constant 1995 prices. The
national accounts compilation system suffers from a number of deficiencies, including the
lack of a comprehensive data collection program. Instead, the existing system relies heavily
1

United Arab Emirates: Report of the Multisector Statistics/GDDS mission, December 2003.

- 34 -

on administrative and other ad-hoc data collected by Federal and Emirate institutions. The
data collected are mostly quantity data. The last benchmark data available for compiling
output are from 1995, and 1980 for intermediate consumption. Basic data remain inadequate
for manufacturing, construction, wholesale and retail trade, and most of the other service
sectors. In particular, real value added for petrochemicals, which accounts for nearly half of
total manufacturing value added, is not estimated according to the 1993 SNA methodology.
Instead nominal value added is deflated by an estimated import price deflator, as is done with
real hydrocarbon value added. This methodology yields a purchasing power measure of
petrochemical output, which may result in under or overestimation of volume growth,
depending on changes in crude oil prices. Despite their importance in total GDP, oil and gas
sector data are received with a lag from the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC).
No national household budget survey has ever been conducted. In addition to the inadequate
sources, the statistical techniques used in compiling GDP by production and expenditure
approach are not sound.
5.
Although labor statistics collected in the census are broadly in line with ILO
recommendations, there are divergences from ILO definitions, including inconsistency of
some concepts and irregular and incomplete updating of the census data. Lack of regular
household surveys prevents compilation of annual data on basic national labor force statistics
such as wages, unemployment, labor force and employment. Wage statistics are, for
example, available only for a small proportion of government employees.
Fiscal sector
6.
Principal deficiencies can be attributed to both the lack of coordination among the
Emirates and Federal government, and the low frequency in reporting of government
financial operations. The Ministry of Finance and Industry (MOFI) compiles data for the
Federal government only. Separate fiscal data on the Federal government and three Emirates
(Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Sharjah), which are provided to the annual Article IV consultations,
are employed by Fund staff to provide a consolidated fiscal account for the U.A.E. An
annual, “consolidated” fiscal statement is published in the central bank’s Statistical Bulletin,
which is different from the Fund staff presentation. Most notably, investment income from
government assets is not included in the fiscal account. In addition, key information, such as
investment income, and expenditure under the control of the respective Rulers’ Offices and
municipalities, remains off-budget in some Emirates, hindering comparison of fiscal
developments across the Emirates and the Federal government. International standards of
economic classification of expenditure and revenue are not fully followed.
7.
The last data reported to STA for publication in the Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook were for 1999 and covered only the Federal government. No financing information
is provided by either the Federal authorities or any of the Emirates. No sub-annual data are
reported for publication to the IMF’s International Financial Statistics (IFS). Information on
pension fund activities administered by the authorities through the Federal-level General

- 35 -

Pension and Social Security Authority (GPSSA) has been available since the 2002
consultation mission.2
Monetary sector
8.
Until recently, the principal issues in monetary statistics were limited to the
classification and sectorization of loans to the corporate, other resident, and non-resident
sectors. Starting in mid-2001, however, the Central Bank of the U.A.E. (CBU) changed the
method for compilation of banking data, such that deposits of U.A.E. residents booked in
overseas branches/subsidiaries of locally incorporated banks were included in the measure of
broad money, and cross border flows back to head offices were treated as “domestic.”3 The
rationale behind this change, as explained by authorities, was their observation that almost all
of the funds deposited in the overseas branches (to circumvent the reserve requirement)
almost instantly found their way back into the domestic banking system. The compilation
introduced in mid-2001 does not follow internationally accepted standards that are based on
the residency principle. In 2005, the authorities reverted to the publication of monetary data
based on the residency principle.
9.
The 2003 STA multisector mission recommended that two sets of data be compiled—
a core set for monetary reporting purposes and a supplementary data set that meets other
objectives of the authorities. The multisector mission also recommended: that lags in
monetary statistics, which are compiled monthly, but reported only quarterly, be reduced;
full coverage of IMF accounts; further sectorization of financial transactions, in particular of
various Emirate government accounts, that are currently reported in aggregate form; and
further instrument classification of foreign securities and domestic investments into bonds,
shares, and other equities.
External sector
10.
Balance of payments (BOP) statistics suffer from a lack of primary data sources for
most transactions. Staffing for BOP compilation is insufficient, and cooperation from other
government agencies remains negligible. Many entries are estimates based on incomplete
information and some important transactions, such as foreign direct investment (FDI), are not
covered at all and only estimated by Fund’s staff. There are major gaps in official and private
transfers, oil companies’ service payments, private and official investment income, and
financial transactions for all sectors except banks. Progress in addressing these shortcomings
2

The GPSSA was established in January 1999 to provide pension and social security insurance benefits to all
nationals working in the government and the private sectors (except Abu Dhabi government employees which
have their own separate pension fund).
3

The compilation initially introduced a bias into banking statistics, especially net foreign positions of
commercial banks, of about AED 20 billion. Balance of payments flows are also compromised, because these
statistics are the source of banking flows in the BOP accounts.

- 36 -

continues to be hampered by staffing limitations in the compilation unit, inadequate interagency cooperation, and other restrictions on the CBU with respect to collection of data from
individuals and institutions other than the banking sector. The U.A.E. does not report BOP
data for publication in the IMF’s IFS (with the exception of trade statistics, which have been
irregular at best), or the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook (BOPSY).
11.
The 2003 STA multisector statistics mission provided recommendations to address
these problems. These include the introduction of a comprehensive data collection system,
the review of source data and compilation methods for important items such as trade and
services, and the strengthening of the human resources for compiling departments in the
CBU. Furthermore, the mission encouraged the CBU to start reporting time series data on the
balance of payments, as well as methodological notes, to STA for publication in the IFS and
the BOPSY. The authorities publish and provide data to Fund missions on banking system
foreign assets. Detailed information on central bank reserves and foreign currency liquidity is
available. Commercial bank data are also reported. These data are disseminated on a monthly
basis. Since 2000, the authorities in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi have provided to Fund staff,
during Article IV consultation missions, approximate information on the Emirate’s stock of
external assets. During 2004-06 Article IV consultations, details on the stock of official
foreign assets of the government were provided.
12.
The authorities do not compile or publish the International Investment Position (IIP)
statement, despite ready availability of certain potential sources, such as banking and
government statistics. Also, no data on FDI or private nonfinancial sector external assets and
liabilities are collected—although, according to BIS statistics the U.A.E.’s external liabilities
are relatively small.
Socio-demographic statistics
13.
The U.A.E. follows the practice of many other countries, with the MOE taking the
lead in conducting the population census and large surveys, while line ministries collect data
through their administrative reporting systems. As in other countries, a population and
housing census is conducted every 10 years. The 2005 population census has been completed
but results are yet to be published. At present, no data exist on measures of income
distribution, poverty and access to basic services. A Household Budget Survey has been
initiated and is expected to be completed by the end of 2006.

APPENDIX IV

Financial Sector Developments in the United Arab Emirates
Overview
1.
This appendix examines trends in financial soundness indicators and recent
developments in the banking system; and developments in capital market regulations and
supervision, as well as related staff’s recommendations. It also discusses developments in the
Dubai International Financial Center and updates the status of the 2001 FSAP mission
recommendations.
Banking sector
2.
The banking sector’s balance sheet and profits increased substantially in 2005.
Led by robust growth in deposits and credit, the overall size of banks’ balance sheet
increased by 40 percent to AED 608.5 billion ($166 billion). Government deposits in the
banking sector increased by 54 percent. The overall rate of return on assets averaged 2.7
percent and the rate of return on equities increased to about 23 percent.
3.
Banks’ exposures to the booming real estate sector and equity market increased
substantially. Lending to the real estate sector, excluding mortgages increased to 12 percent
of total credit from 10 percent in 2004. The share of banks’ direct lending to the equity
market increased to about 6 percent of total credit from just slightly over 1 percent in 2004.
Indirect lending through personal loans, however, could be higher.
4.
Banks’ profits more than doubled to $5.1 billion during 2005. Non-interest
income, excluding income on foreign exchange, increased by over 112 percent, comprising
about one third of total banks’ income. Most of this increase was driven by fees and
commissions on IPO subscriptions, and income generated from banks’ investment in the
equity market. IPO financing through margin lending also provided the banks with ample
non-interest-bearing cash for considerable periods of time.1
5.
Macro-prudential indicators of the banking sector remained strong in 2005. The
capital-assets ratio (CAR) increased slightly to 17.4 percent. The ratio of nonperforming
loans (NPL) to total loans declined to 8.3 percent and provisions were considerable. On an
aggregate basis, banks complied with the CBU’s prudential norms. Maturity mismatches
grew, however, since lending for infrastructure and construction projects are of a long-term
nature and the average maturity of deposits is only three months. While banks have a
substantial long dollar position, foreign exchange risk is limited by the government’s
credible commitment to a dollar peg. Non-dollar exposures are small.

1

The CBU regulations set a maximum margin lending ratio of 5 to 1. Investors can also apply for credit
collateralized by securities and other assets to use for IPO subscription.

- 39 -

APPENDIX IV

Capital market regulations and supervision
6.
The capital markets in the U.A.E. are regulated by a number of entities. The
CBU is responsible for licensing and authorizing banks and non-bank financial
intermediaries,2 including brokers and investment companies. The Ministry of Economy
(MOE) is responsible for implementing the Company Law, corporate governance standards
for issuers, prospectus disclosure requirements and the pricing of IPOs. The Emirates
Securities and Commodities Authority (ESCA) licenses intermediaries to trade on the two
stock exchanges, Abu Dhabi Stock Market (ADSM) and Dubai Financial Market (DFM),3
and the Dubai Gold and Commodity Exchange (DGCX). The two stock markets act as selfregulatory organizations,4 authorize firms to trade on their respective exchanges, set listing
standards, and accept listings of public company securities.
7.
The CBU’s licensing requirements for investment companies and brokers dates
from the mid-1990’s. The corporate law follows a pattern established in the UK in the 1920s
and contains provisions regarding capital structure that may hamper the development of
publicly traded companies. For example, new issues of equity securities require prior
shareholder approval and shares can only be issued at a premium to their nominal value,
regardless of current market price, with the consent of the MOE. Beyond a licensing regime
for investment companies, there is no framework in place to govern the formation and
operation of or disclosure by collective investment schemes (CIS).
8.
The responsibilities of regulatory agencies need to be clearly defined. In
particular, the law should give the regulatory authorities clear powers to set and enforce
comprehensive prospectus requirements and corporate governance standards for public
companies. Responsibility for licensing investment companies and brokers should be
consolidated in one authority, which should also be responsible for establishing and
enforcing initial (prospectus rules) and continuous disclosure requirements for public
companies. As the ESCA’s capabilities improve, responsibilities for securities oversight,
including the regulatory role related to rules for IPOs and CISs should be transferred from
the CBU to the ECSA.
9.
The authorities will need to develop and implement a comprehensive regime to
govern the operations of CISs. Also, the CBU should begin collecting statistical
information on mutual funds. All regulatory authorities should build sufficient capacity to
2

As of end-2005, non-bank financial institutions include 102 money changers, 53 representative offices of
foreign banks, 8 investment companies, 7 finance companies, 32 financial intermediaries (such as brokers), 12
financial consultants, and 33 electronic banking units.

3
4

All public companies are required to be listed on one of these exchanges.

The term self-regulatory organization refers to organizations that have some self regulatory functions, such as
setting their own listing rules. In the UAE, the markets have not been specifically delegated this authority by the
ESCA.

- 40 -

APPENDIX IV

ensure that their staff have the right skills to carry out their mandate effectively. Although
both the ESCA and the exchanges have investor education programs, the government should
lend its support for an expansion of these programs.
10.
The MOE establishes the price of IPOs for both state-owned and private
companies. The price is set at the nominal value of the company’s shares rather than through
an accurate assessment of the company’s fair market value. The MOE is also involved in the
pricing of subsequent offerings by public companies. The MOE controls issuers’ access to
the market by accepting or rejecting applications for issues by companies. As a result, prices
are set artificially low, this contributed to increased market volatility, unreasonable
expectations of retail investors, and has deprived enterprises of the full value they should be
getting for funds raised in the capital market.
11.
The Company Law needs to be amended with respect to the pricing of the public
issues of securities. Subscription prices for new offerings should be set by the market
through professional underwriters based on an appropriate valuation of the company. Also,
intervention in pricing of subsequent offerings by currently listed companies should be
restricted to a limit on the discount of the market price. Rationing of subscription allotments
may no longer be necessary once IPOs have been priced appropriately and according to the
true value of the company. Also, the authorities should only permit IPOs for companies that
have had audited balance sheets for at least two years.
12.
Public floating of securities needs to be increased to promote deeper and liquid
markets. In a deep market, large blocks of stocks can be traded quickly without unduly
affecting the market price of the stocks. A wide distribution of shares among a large number
of active traders helps increase liquidity. In the U.A.E., many public companies with
significant numbers of shares outstanding have relatively few shareholders. The high
government participation in the ownership of the shares of public companies has also
resulted in fewer shares being available for trading in the market. Moreover, requirements
that force founding shareholders to subscribe to a significant portion of a company’s equity
for long periods of time have resulted in few shareholders holding a significant number of
shares outstanding. Finally, the pre-emptive rights of existing shareholders to subscribe prorata on any new issue reduces the opportunity for wider ownership of these companies.
13.
The participation of long-term institutional investors in the securities markets is
low. Retail investors represent a very high percentage of investors in the U.A.E. market. The
estimated participation rate for retail investors varies from 60 percent to 90 percent of the
market.5 Impediments to market investments by insurance companies, collective investment
schemes and pensions funds should be eliminated. Institutional investors that have a limited

In contrast, retail investors represent about 50 percent of investors in the United States and less than
25 percent of the investors in Canada.

- 41 -

APPENDIX IV

need to liquidate securities to fund redemptions, such as closed-end funds, can provide
additional stability in volatile markets.
14.
The markets would benefit from the introduction of market stabilization
mechanisms, such as market maker mechanisms and hedging instruments that can
provide liquidity and allow investors to manage their risks more effectively. Market
maker mechanisms stand ready to trade securities if there are imbalances in the offers to buy
or sell. These mechanisms help stabilize prices at times where there are significant buying or
selling pressure. The rules of the new DGCX require the appointment of market maker
mechanisms. The DFM and the ADSM should be encouraged to introduce the same. ESCA
should upgrade its staff capability in order to monitor effectively such mechanisms.
Moreover, the development of exchange-traded hedging instruments such as options should
be facilitated so that market risks can be managed more effectively.
15.
In the U.A.E., multiple margin rates are set for the same publicly traded security
based on the nature of the loan.6 In recognition of the volatile nature of this type of
collateral, the market value of the securities is discounted by a percentage. However,
multiple margin rates are applied to loans depending on the nature of the loan. Also, the
discount applied is low, particularly for subscriptions for IPOs, where banks are permitted to
lend up to five times the amount contributed by the borrower.7 The multiple margin rates
should be replaced by a single rate for each class of securities. The risk in the value of the
collateral varies based on the nature of the collateral, not the loan for which it is pledged.
Also, the maximum loan value that can be given for most liquid traded stocks should be set
at 50 percent, similar to the margin rate provided in major international markets, such as
those in New York and London. Consideration should also be given to setting a more
conservative rate for less liquid stocks. The new rates could be introduced incrementally in
order to avoid a credit crunch and margin calls in the market.
16.
Regulations on corporate governance needs to be amended. ADSM is in the
process of consulting with market participants about a corporate governance code for listed
companies. The necessary resources need to be allocated to complete these corporate
governance initiatives on a priority basis.
Dubai International Financial Center
17.
The DIFC has established its own set of civil and commercial laws, courts, and
an arbitration system built on the common law of the UK. Only the criminal laws of the

In the U.A.E. margin loans are available to finance the purchase of securities and are secured by a pledge of
the assets purchased. Marketable securities may also be pledged to a lending institution as collateral to secure
other types of loans.

Until 2005, this limit was 50 percent that is, half the value of the purchase would have to be contributed by the
subscriber.

APPENDIX IV

U.A.E. apply within the DIFC. The Dubai Financial Securities Authority (DFSA) has entered
into memoranda of understandings (MOU) with the UK’s Financial Services Authority, the
U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Authority, and the ESCA in the U.A.E. The DIFC is in
discussions about entering into an MOU with the CBU.
18.
Considerable progress has been made with respect to the regulatory framework
governing the DIFC, and an extensive set of laws have been created based on best
international practices. As of mid-February 2006, 160 companies and 40 financial
institutions have been granted licenses to operate within the free zone. However, the actual
volume of business conducted at the DIFC is still small. By design, its operations are
intended to be segregated from those of the financial markets in the rest of the U.A.E.
Banking operations are confined to institutional wholesale banking, with both deposit taking
and lending in dirham prohibited.
19.
In the event that some of the operations of the U.A.E. banks that are currently
taking place in the domestic markets migrate to the DIFC, a working relationship with
the CBU will be very important. The agreement between the two authorities should provide
for information sharing arrangements and detail how the actual supervision, risk management
and capital management of banks will be carried out. The opportunity for financial
innovations to exploit regulatory arbitrage and produce shifts of funds between the DIFC and
the U.A.E will depend on the specifics of regulations and operations and will require careful
monitoring.

APPENDIX IV

FSAP recommendations8
Table 2: Update of FSAP Recommendations
Recommendation

Status

Banking Supervision

(1) The supervision of groups containing both
banks, insurance companies and securities firms
should be enhanced by having regular contact
between the CBU and insurance supervisor and
securities regulator, and by ensuring that the CBU
has assured access to the prudential returns of
insurance companies in such groups. (Core
Principle (CP) 1(6)).

Still under discussion.

(2) The new securities legislation requires the CBU
to pre-approve holdings exceeding 5 percent in
listed banks. Procedures for such pre-approvals
should be established within the CBU. The
principle of pre-approval should also be extended
to non-listed banks. (CP 4)

Partial progress.

(3) The CBU should issue guidelines or circulars
requiring banks to have adequate policies and
procedures for the identification, measurement and
control of market risk (CP 12) and should introduce
explicit requirements for banks to have a
comprehensive risk management process to
identify, measure and control material risks.
(CP 13) (A pilot study on risk-based supervision
that is now under way, may establish the basis for
the CBU providing guidance in these areas.)

Informal progress only.

8

A dialog is ongoing to determine how best to
address this recommendation.

There are no procedures to pre-approve holdings
in listed banks in excess of 5 percent. The draft
banking law extends the principle of pre-approval
to non-listed banks.

No guidelines or circulars have been issued to
address market risk in this context or require
banks to have a comprehensive risk management
process. However the CBU is in the third year of
its risk-based supervision, in which they examine
a bank’s credit risk, operational risk, and market
risk and how the bank implements policies to
address them.

APPENDIX IV

Recommendation

Status

(4) Off-balance sheet items and inter-bank
exposures to U.A.E. banks with maturities of less
than 12 months should be included in the definition
of large exposures. (CP 9)

Not yet implemented.

(5) Members of a bank’s staff who report
suspicious transactions in good faith to the
compliance officer of the CBU should be protected
from being held liable (protection is included in the
draft Banking Law). (CP 15)

Completed.

This issue is most relevant in the case of import
guarantees and guarantees for large construction
projects. In the case of import guarantees, the
authorities indicate that the banks would be
protected because they could seize control of the
goods in case of nonpayment. In the case of
construction, the banks are partly protected by
the practice of requiring certification before any
contractor receives a payment, and enforcing this
restriction would be infeasible since it would
create a major obstacle to development in the
construction industry.

Federal Law no. 4 of 2002 (regarding the
criminalization of money laundering), Article 20
addresses this.

Securities
(1) Work to eliminate the current state of market
confusion which exists as a result of the ESCA’s
delay in fully commencing operations.

Completed.

(2) Rationalize the regulatory responsibilities of the
ESCA, the CBU, the MOE, and the securities
markets as soon as possible, and effectively
communicate the results to the markets.

Groundwork has been laid.

ESCA is fully operational.

There is an expectation that ESCA will gradually
undertake more responsibilities, but this shift
cannot take place until the ESCA builds up its
staff and capacity, which is an ongoing process.
Under the law the ESCA has supervisory
responsibility for brokerage houses, listed
companies, and the two stock exchanges. It
should also have responsibility for investment
companies, mutual funds, IPOs, and
nongovernment pension funds (which do not yet
exist, but are envisioned). An ordinary broker
may only deal with U.A.E. listed securities. A
broker who wants also to deal with international
securities has to be licensed by the Central Bank.

- 46 -

APPENDIX IV

Recommendation

Status

(3) The ESCA should expeditiously commence its
staffing exercise (the adequacy of qualified staff
will greatly enhance the perception of market
integrity).

Good and ongoing progress.

(4) The two securities exchanges (Abu Dhabi and
Dubai) should establish an electronic
trading/clearing linkage as required under the law
as soon as possible (this will contribute to both
market efficiency and integrity).

Completed.

(5) Significant effort should be expended to
develop the corporate debt market and increase the
participation of nonbank financial institutions such
as pension funds, insurance companies, and mutual
funds.

Progress is underway.

(6) Improvements should be made to the corporate
governance environment including minority
shareholder protections.

Not implemented.

Increases in staffing and training have been
ongoing. Training is provided locally, in the
GCC region, and outside the region.

There is an electronic trading linkage. There is no
clearing linkage, but according to the authorities
this is not required by the law. Companies are not
cross listed on the exchanges. There are plans to
completely merge the two exchanges. Both
exchanges now settle on a T+2 basis.

The ESCA plans shortly to issue a set of rules on
the listing of bonds. A committee that includes all
banks in the region has been established to
develop bond markets in the region.

Transparency
(1) Transparency could be improved if all financial
sector regulators and supervisors were more active
in seeking stakeholders’, including the private
sector, inputs when they are contemplating changes
in laws, regulations, technical requirements,
policies, or otherwise.

Good progress.

All banks reported that they have good, continual
communication with the CBU. Whenever
changes in laws, regulations, technical
requirements, or policies are contemplated their
input is sought.

- 47 -

Recommendation

APPENDIX IV

Status

Legal reforms
(1) Enact the proposed amendments to the
companies legislation and make provision for
improved minority shareholder rights, better
corporate governance provisions and simplified
company formation procedures. Improve operation
of and accessibility to the Company Register.

Progress is underway.

(2) Improve registration procedures for movable
property and create mechanisms for the registration
of non-possessory pledges.

Good and ongoing progress.

(3) Simplify the law relating to the ownership,
transfer, and charging of real estate. Improve
operation of the Land Registry and make it freely
and fully accessible to the public.

Good and ongoing progress.

(4) Enact the proposed amendments to the Banking
Law, including the proposed anti-money
laundering provisions.

Good and ongoing progress.

(5) Consider introducing an accelerated and
simplified procedure for the handling of small
value claims, e.g., claims under AED 50,000.

No progress.

The authorities are currently drafting a new
banking law and a new company law, both of
which address corporate governance and
minority shareholder rights.

Registration procedures for many types of
movable property have been improved. No
information was provided on non-possessory
pledges.

Foreigners are now allowed to own land in Dubai
and there are plans to allow this in all the
Emirates. The Land Registry is freely available
and fully accessible to the public.

Several key laws have been passed, including
Federal law #4 of 2002 on anti-money
laundering, Federal Law #1 of 2004 which
addresses combating the financing of terrorism,
and Federal Law #8 of 2004 which addresses
AML/CFT in the financial free zone. Work
continues on the new banking law, which has not
yet been enacted.

- 48 -

APPENDIX IV

Recommendation

Status

Insurance

Some progress.

(1) Increasing the staff of the Insurance Division of
MOE to include more individuals who possess the
skills necessary to carry out off-site analyses and
on-site inspections. In addition, an appropriate
official should be appointed as the U.A.E.
Insurance Commissioner.

There is an ongoing process of hiring and
training new staff.

(2) Carrying out a full review of the insurance law
and regulations with a view to bringing it up to
current best practice, while allowing for the unique
U.A.E. context. In the interim the proposed
amendments to the insurance law should probably
be held back. In particular a formal study of the
capital requirements and investment risks for
foreign branches is highly desirable.

Not yet implemented.

(3) Reviewing the constraints inhibiting industry
rationalization, with a view to making it more
desirable for domestic companies, and easier for
foreign branches to merge. In addition, where
insurers are engaged in regional rather than local
market activities there may be grounds for easing
the rules on work visas and other requirements for
non-nationals, although this would have to be
tightly monitored.

Progress is unclear.

(4) Developing a deeper and more liquid market for
local property and securities by allowing some
portfolio investment in key sectors by foreign
insurers operating in the domestic market. This
would encourage further development of local
currency denominated investment and savings
products, including Takaful. To ensure local
participation in a growing life insurance industry
joint ventures could be allowed (or required), for
foreign involvement in local markets.

Limited progress.

The creation of an independent authority for the
supervision of insurance—which it was hoped
would be completed by end-2004—is stillenvisioned. Once a new Authority is in place the
relevant staff of the MOE would be transferred to
it.

No comprehensive study of the insurance law
and regulations has taken place. However,
gradual improvements have been ongoing. Two
Ministerial decrees have been issued in recent
years; one to improve transparency, and another
to allow foreign entry into the insurance market.
Amendments to the law in order to bring it into
line with international standards are still
envisioned.

No specific legislation has been enacted. Review
of constraints to rationalization or work visas has
taken place only at a low level.

There has been no specific progress on
legislation. Publicly traded companies have
gradually been allowing more foreign
investment, though this is at their initiative. The
upcoming free trade agreement with the United
States and compliance with the WTO will require
greater openness.

- 49 -

Recommendation

APPENDIX IV

Status

Payment system
(1) The CBU should review its procedures for
providing overdrafts and implement a system
whereby the CBU only lends to banks against
proper collateral. Publication of its overdraft
procedures could also be considered.

Partial progress.

Lending is still made without requiring proper
collateral, but the amount of the loan cannot
exceed reserves on deposit with the CBU, so the
loan can be recovered by seizing required
reserves. Such loans are for a maximum of six
days and a penalty interest of five percent over
the three-month interbank rate is applied.
These rules for overdrafts are publicly disclosed
in a circular on the internet. The amounts of the
overdrafts are not publicly disclosed.

(2) To prepare for increases in transaction volume
and reduce reliance on manual procedures, the
CBU should consider greater automation and
computerization of the existing systems. In the
interim, it could also consider limiting the value of
different types of transfers—a minimum amount
for a Telex Transfer and a maximum amount for a
check.

Completed.

(3) In the medium term, a move to a more advanced
automatic system that would give the payment
system both increased capacity and greater
protection from operational risks. This might
include moving from a T+1 system for check
settlement to same day settlement. Consideration
should also be given to the risks involved with the
introduction of the new real time gross settlement
system that would replace the Telex Testkey
System.

Good progress.

Automation and computerization have moved
forward at a fast pace. Telexes are no longer used
for any transfers. All transfers are made
electronically and there is no need for any limits
on different types of transfers.

Automation and computerization have been
expanded. Telexes are no longer used for any
transfers.

Statement by IMF Staff Representative
June 12, 2006

This statement provides information on recent developments in the U.A.E. that has become
available since the staff report was circulated to the Executive board on May 25, 2006. The
new information does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
Recent economic developments
1.
During January-April, 2006, credit to the private sector increased by 10.8 percent and
broad money increased by 8.1 percent. At end-May, the U.A.E. increased diesel prices by 2.3
percent to 8.90 dirham ($2.43) per gallon.
Capital markets related issues
1.
As of June 7, the Abu Dhabi Securities Market (ADSM) and Dubai Financial Market
(DFM), respectively, declined by about 41 percent and 62 percent from their peaks in
November 2005.
2.
In May, the Central Bank of the U.A.E. (CBU) issued a circular to commercial banks
requiring them to report their exposure to the equity markets and instructed them to provide
full details on their outstanding loans to both institutional and individual investors. Also, in
May, the CBU issued a circular that increased the ceiling for loans extended by banks against
pledges of shares of companies which have been in operations for more than 5 years. The
ceiling was raised from 70 percent to 80 percent of the market value of these shares.
3.
Recently, the cabinet approved new rules allowing companies to buy back up to 10
percent of their own shares. Previously, companies could only buy their own shares if the
shares fell below book value. The federal government is currently in the process of amending
the Company Law. Under the amended law, the existing regulation that requires private
businesses to float a minimum of 55 percent of their shares to become a public joint stock
company will be reduced to 30 percent. This change is expected to encourage more
companies to go public.
4.
The authorities agreed to an FSAP Update. This will include a full assessment of the
capital markets in the U.A.E; and the legal regime of the Dubai International Financial
Center and the Dubai Financial Service Authority. Developments in the banking sector will
also be assessed.
5.
In April, the cabinet approved amendments to the Commercial Agency Law. The two
main amendments include setting the ceiling for ownership of nationals in publicly traded
insurance companies at 75 percent, and requiring the two stock markets, ADSM and DFM, to
convert to public joint stock companies. Recently a decree was issued to form a committee to
transform the DFM into a public joint stock company.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with
the United Arab Emirates
On June 12, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the United Arab Emirates.1
Background
An outward-oriented development strategy and prudent financial policies have resulted in
impressive economic growth over the years and have led to a large accumulation of external
financial assets. This success has been underpinned by Abu Dhabi’s prudent management of
its oil wealth and Dubai’s strong push for economic diversification. All indications are that the
liberal economic policies followed thus far will be broadened and accelerated in the period
ahead. Strong economic fundamentals and a pro-business approach to economic management
are resulting in high levels of domestic and foreign investment in the manufacturing, services,
and real estate sectors. These dynamics bode well for the economy’s medium-term growth
prospects.
Economic growth has been impressive, reflecting sharply higher oil prices, increased oil
production, strong investor confidence, and a significant increase in foreign direct investment.
Preliminary data for 2005 indicate that real nonhydrocarbon GDP grew at 11 percent, while the
hydrocarbon sector registered a growth rate of 2.1 percent. Growth was broad-based with most
sub-sectors growing at historically high rates, especially in manufacturing, real estate and
construction, and trade. However, inflation has been on the rise, driven by the strength of
domestic demand, a hike in gasoline prices and a significant increase in the prices of nonUnder Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.

-2tradables such as rents and services. Both the external current account and overall
consolidated fiscal balances are estimated to have recorded large surpluses in 2005
(14.7 percent and 26.9 percent of GDP, respectively). The nonhydrocarbon deficit (excluding
investment income) narrowed by 1.7 percentage points of GDP, to 17.3 percent. The broad
money stock rose by 34 percent, mainly on account of a rapid increase in private sector credit.
In 2005, Abu Dhabi’s budget improved markedly owing to high oil prices and moderate
expenditure increases. Its work force was reduced by about 8,000 workers (14.5 percent)
because some services previously provided by the municipality were outsourced to the private
sector. The two other key emirates, Dubai and Sharjah, maintained their policy of executing
budgets that are largely in balance. However, Dubai’s budget does not provide a
comprehensive picture of its fiscal accounts. Considerable fiscal operations continue to be
carried outside the budget, and information about these operations is currently not available.
The public sector across the U.A.E. is undergoing a major shift to restructure and outsource
many activities to the private sector.
The equity markets, after having risen significantly since 2004, have had a sharp correction
since their peaks in November 2005. The sharp corrections in the U.A.E. bourses were due to
market overvaluation and the liquidation of existing positions to fund subscriptions for Initial
Public Offerings (IPOs). The high demand for IPOs was in turn the result of a policy of
underpricing them.
The banking sector in the U.A.E. remains strong, bolstered by effective supervision, but the fast
growing capital markets and nonbank financial institutions pose new regulatory challenges.
Overall, the capital-asset ratio increased slightly to 17.4 percent, while the ratio of
nonperforming loans (NPL) to total loans declined and provisions were considerable, bringing
the net NPL ratio below 2 percent. The share of banks’ direct lending to the equity market
increased to about 6 percent of total loans in 2005 from just slightly over 1 percent in 2004.
The U.A.E. authorities, are taking steps to continue to strengthen supervision of capital markets
and nonbank financial institutions. Also, considerable progress has been made with respect to
the regulatory framework governing the Dubai International Financial Center and an extensive
set of laws have been enacted, benchmarked to best international practices.
The major emirates (Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Sharjah) are capitalizing on the favorable economic
environment to carry out reforms that will foster more private sector participation and further
diversify the economy. Dubai passed a property law which allows 100 percent foreign
ownership of properties in pre-designated areas, while working with the private sector to provide
infrastructure and other services that are traditionally provided and financed by the public
sector. Sharjah established a number of industrial free zones and also benefited from attracting
new small and medium-sized enterprises that are rapidly expanding. Abu Dhabi has embraced
utility privatization and rationalized its fiscal policy through outsourcing of public expenditure.
The authorities are planning to increase development expenditures significantly in 2006 and
over the medium-term. Key government entities (such as the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company,
Dubai Ports Authority, and Dubai Aluminum Company) have massive investment plans to
further increase the capacity of upstream activities in the petrochemicals sector, infrastructure in
airports and ports, and new manufacturing plants in the metals sector. Over the medium-term,
the total investment in Dubai is conservatively estimated at $200 billion. Similarly, about $160
billion worth of projects are planned for Abu Dhabi. Over the next five to seven years, oil

-3production capacity in Abu Dhabi is expected to expand from 2.9 million barrels to 3.5 million
barrels per day.
Limited improvements have been made in the U.A.E.’s economic and social statistics which
continue to suffer from numerous structural weaknesses with respect to data quality, coverage,
periodicity, timeliness, and inter-sectoral consistency.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities of the U.A.E. for pursuing market friendly
policies, an outward-oriented development strategy, and prudent financial policies, which have
resulted in an impressive economic growth over the years and led to a large accumulation of
external financial assets. Directors welcomed the continued progress in diversifying the
economy and the implementation of structural reforms. They agreed that the U.A.E. is in a
strong position to take advantage of the buoyant regional economic growth, but stressed that
the authorities’ primary objective should be to ensure that economic expansion proceeds at a
sustainable pace while maintaining macroeconomic stability.
Directors viewed that the medium-term economic outlook remains favorable. They stressed,
however, that, in the near term, a number of risks, including, price developments in the equity
and real estate markets and accelerating inflationary pressures, warrant close monitoring. Given
the limitations of monetary policy resulting from the fixed exchange rate and liberalized capital
account, Directors stressed that if the rapid increase in private sector credit and inflationary
pressure persist in 2006, much of the burden of tightening financial policies would need to fall
on public spending.
Directors agreed that the comfortable fiscal position and the significant accumulation of financial
assets support increases in infrastructure and social outlays to broaden growth and enhance
the absorptive capacity of the economy. Spending should be set in line with the economy’s
absorptive capacity, in order to maintain macroeconomic stability. They encouraged the
authorities to link wage increases to gains in public sector productivity, and to replace subsidies
on water and electricity with income-related payments to nationals below a certain income level.
Directors urged greater policy coordination between the emirates and the federal governments,
and recommended the introduction of legislation to reform the General Pension and Social
Security System, while it is running operational surpluses. They urged the authorities to start the
preparatory work based on the recommendations of the IMF Fiscal Affairs Department for the
introduction of a Value Added Tax system at the federal level.
Directors noted that, notwithstanding the limitations of monetary policy in the U.A.E., if credit
growth to the private sector continues at a rapid pace and inflationary pressures persist, the
authorities could tighten credit by raising provisioning rates for credits carrying greater-thanaverage risks, increasing the minimum amount of equity needed for approval of real estate and
margin trading loans, and tightening collateral requirements. A gradual reduction of the percent
at which individuals can borrow against their salaries could also be considered.
Directors commended the authorities for the financially sound and well-supervised banking
system. However, they cautioned that increased lending for real estate and equity financing has
led to a rise in credit risk, and stressed that banks’ direct and indirect exposure to these markets
and the increased loan concentration in a few large business groups call for close monitoring by

-4the central bank. The adequacy of prudential regulation should be kept under review, and banks
that recorded significant growth in profits from equity markets related activities should be closely
supervised.
Directors highlighted the urgent need to define the responsibilities of the various entities
involved in regulating the capital markets and its participants, addressing gaps in regulations,
and rationalizing the extensive overlaps in responsibilities. They welcomed the planned full
assessment of the capital markets regime against International Organization of Securities
Commissions’ standards. Directors stressed that the pricing of IPOs should be set by the
market through professional underwriters based on an appropriate company valuation. Equity
markets would benefit from the introduction of market stabilization mechanisms, such as a
market maker system and hedging instruments that can provide liquidity and allow investors to
manage their risks more effectively. They welcomed the authorities’ agreement to undertake a
Financial Sector Assessment Program update.
Directors agreed that the fixed exchange rate policy has served the U.A.E. economy well. They
welcomed the authorities’ intention to remain open regarding the choice of exchange rate
regime under the planned Gulf Cooperation Council monetary union.
Directors stressed the importance of enhancing the investment climate beyond the free
zones, and fostering private sector participation more generally. They encouraged the
authorities to pass the amended company law, which will allow higher foreign investment in
U.A.E.-based companies. They stressed that labor policies should be implemented flexibly to
avoid undue pressures on private sector salaries, in order to preserve competitiveness.
To address employment of nationals, attention should be given to long-term education, training,
appropriate wage policies, and labor legislation.
Directors urged the authorities to strengthen the institutional framework and build-up a
strong, comprehensive, and consistent statistical system. Data should be compiled on offbudget fiscal operations and on domestic and external debt at the emirate level, and fiscal
transparency at the emirates’ level should be enhanced by adopting international standards of
classification for expenditure and revenue statistics. The authorities are urged to finalize the
General Data Dissemination Standard (GDDS) metadata and nominate a GDDS coordinator.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Shakour Shaalan, Executive Director for United Arab Emirates
June 12, 2006

1.
On behalf of the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.) authorities, we would like to express
our appreciation to staff for their contribution to another round of productive consultation and
well-balanced advice reflected in the rigorous report before us. The authorities are in broad
support of the thrust of the staff analysis and policy recommendations.
Recent Developments and Outlook
2.
The U.A.E.’s liberal and business-oriented approach to economic policy, set against a
background of buoyant oil prices, has contributed to yet another year of impressive economic
performance. Indeed, 2005 was marked by continued strong growth, supported by robust
expansion in the non-oil sector at 11 percent, and the accumulation of record surpluses on the
fiscal and external accounts. Underpinning this performance is the steadfast commitment to
judiciously utilize hydrocarbon revenues, to intensify the diversification process, and to further
solidify economic fundamentals. The economy’s dynamism rendered it a natural destination for
the ample regional liquidity. Consequently, and similar to developments elsewhere in the
region, asset prices surged, which together with the increased vigor in economic activity and a
hike in domestic fuel prices, seem to have pushed up prices somewhat. The recent correction in
the equity markets, also witnessed in regional economies, is expected to facilitate a stabilization
in prices.
3.
The near- and medium-term prospects for the economy remain strong, reinforced by
deliberate policies geared towards expanding domestic absorptive capacity and further
strengthening the resilience of the economy. The authorities’ ambitious medium-term
development agenda—to be executed with a prominent participation of the private sector—
features sizable investments in infrastructure, manufacturing, and hydrocarbon activities, as
well as education and health. In addition to supporting the creation of productive employment
to new entrants to the labor market, these investments are expected to set the stage for a
structurally higher productivity growth and output potential while deepening the diversification
drive along each Emirate’s competitive advantage. Moreover, and while the economic
transformation should temper any potential weakness stemming from hydrocarbon price
volatility, the strength of public finances is such that they remain resilient to slides in oil prices
as low as US$40 per barrel. Finally, notwithstanding the sharp correction in the equity markets
that is partly induced by global shifts in risk aversion, banks are highly profitable and well
capitalized.
Fiscal Policy
4.
Bolstered by higher hydrocarbon revenues and a prudent expenditure policy, the fiscal
position strengthened further, with the consolidated fiscal balance posting a record surplus of
27 percent of GDP, and the non-hydrocarbon deficit narrowing steadily. The steady decline in
expenditures as a proportion of GDP was accompanied by a diminishing share of current
spending, while accommodating increased investment outlays. Attesting to the cautious

2
expenditure approach is the virtual stability of the nominal wage bill over the past few years in
the face of growing revenues. This reflects in large part ongoing efforts to outsource non-core
budget activities to the private sector and retrench the size of the government. Consequently,
and despite recent wage increases for civil servants, the consolidated wage bill to GDP ratio
declined in 2005. This trend is expected to continue into 2006. On the revenue side, Fund
technical assistance is being provided on the introduction of a value-added tax (VAT) in the
context of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which should contribute to a broadening of the
revenue base.
5.
With the existing legal framework conferring significant autonomy to the individual
Emirates, the authorities remain cognizant of the importance of further enhancing the
coordination and consistency of fiscal reporting at the federal and Emirate levels. To this end, a
macro-fiscal unit within the Ministry of Finance and Industry, charged with devising a
consistent macroeconomic framework, is being established with some assistance from the
Fund. At the same time, and with the federal government typically leading the reforms, budget
classification has been aligned with the 2001 GFS standards. The U.A.E. is also currently
pursuing concrete measures to successfully implement performance-based budgeting. A
stronger institutional anchor for harmonized fiscal accounting is likely to emerge within the
context of the GCC monetary union.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
6.
With the capital account fully convertible, monetary policy aims to achieve a prudent
credit stance to stabilize domestic liquidity and support the peg. Developments in 2005 may
have posed some challenges to liquidity management. The substantial expansion in broad
money, induced by the rapid growth in private sector credit, was partly tempered by the
implicitly tightened monetary conditions, following the sharp correction in equity markets and
the reversal of capital flows. To smooth out fluctuations in domestic liquidity, the Central Bank
of U.A.E. (CBU) substantially increased its issuance of certificate of deposits. At the same
time, monetary policy continued to tighten, with the CBU successively hiking interest rates.
The three-month interbank rate increased from 2.4 percent in end-2004 to 4.7 percent in 2005,
and currently stands at 5.14 percent. Going forward, the authorities are contemplating a number
of measures, along the lines proposed by staff, to further tighten monetary conditions, if
needed.
7.
By providing a credible nominal anchor, the authorities believe the pegged exchange
rate remains instrumental in anchoring confidence in their macroeconomic policies. The oil
price-induced appreciation does not appear to erode competitiveness, given the continued
growth in the volume of non-oil exports. Greater trade integration, as envisaged within the
GCC context, should help alleviate the impact of any potential appreciation pressures on
competitiveness.
Financial Sector Issues
8.
Considerable progress has been achieved in financial sector reforms, in line with staff
recommendations, despite the complexity of the U.A.E.’s economic and political structure.
Building on Dubai’s successful diversification drive, the U.A.E. is successfully positioning

3
itself as a regional financial hub. Despite an increased exposure to asset markets, the banking
sector remains strong and well capitalized, bolstered by sizable increases in profitability.
Considerable provisioning has contributed to a net ratio for nonperforming loans (NPL) of less
than 2 percent. Moreover, albeit rising, banks’ exposure to the real estate market through
household credit remains low, and total household indebtedness remains modest.
9.
The global increase in liquidity and buoyant oil prices are driving the surge in regional
equity markets, including in the U.A.E. Admittedly, it is difficult to discern the extent to which
the recent correction was precipitated by speculation or warranted by fundamentals. It is clear,
however, that economic fundamentals have improved. To some extent, the correction in equity
prices was fueled by the wave of Initial Public Offerings (IPO) in 2005 and early 2006, and the
associated liquidation of existing positions to finance subscriptions for IPOs activity. While
they will continue to exercise vigilance regarding future movements in equity prices, the
authorities have stressed their intention to refrain from any intervention in the market.
Effectively managing the balance of risks stemming from abrupt shifts in sentiment would
require domestic financial institutions to keep pace with the rapid evolution of global capital
markets. In this connection, the authorities recognize the need for a national supervisory
framework to regulate capital markets, and are in general agreement with the staff’s detailed
recommendations outlined in Box 4. They will undergo a full assessment of the capital market
regime against the benchmarks established by the International Organization of Securities
Commission (IOSC) by end-2006. At the same time, activities in the Dubai International
Financial Center (DIFC) continue to expand, supported by a sound regulatory framework
aligned with best international practices. The authorities have agreed to a mission to assess the
legal framework of the DIFC and procedures of the Dubai Financial Services Authority, to take
place concurrently with the IOSC assessment in order facilitate the identification of supervision
gaps and overlaps. The mission will also assess the links of the DIFC with the broader
economy.
Structural Policies
10.
The U.A.E. economy continues to rank favorably when gauged by various indices of
competitiveness and business climate indicators. Fostered by an outward-oriented and
streamlined regulatory environment, the attractiveness of the U.A.E. as a destination for foreign
direct investment (FDI) has increased. The authorities have indicated that the various
investment and trade agreements that the U.A.E. has signed with its major trading partners have
contributed to the surge in FDI inflows and to the exceptionally high rates of growth attained in
recent years. Furthermore, the double taxation treaties that accompany these agreements have
encouraged the activities of U.A.E. investors overseas.
11.
Regarding the labor market, and in order to safeguard the competitiveness of the private
sector, the authorities remain committed to a flexible implementation of the Emiratization
policy. They wish to reiterate that their strategy to enhance employability of their nationals in
the private sector relies on human capital accumulation and active labor market policies, with a
view to enhancing the compatibility of the skills of the national labor force with the demands of
the private sector.

4
Statistical Issues
12.
Progress has been achieved in addressing some of the structural weaknesses in the
statistical database. The population census has been completed and the results are expected to
be released by year-end. The census is expected to provide an important statistical backbone
that will enable the gathering of data on other sectors in the economy, including the real sector.
A household budget survey is also expected to be concluded by end-2006, which would inform
ongoing efforts to improve the statistical properties of the consumer price index (CPI). In this
connection, several experts were recruited to strengthen the statistical capacity at the Ministry
of Economy and Planning (MEP). Coordination efforts are currently ongoing between the CBU
and the MEP to advance with the request for Fund technical assistance on the CPI.
