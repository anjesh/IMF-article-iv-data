Mission. A staff team—Robert Burgess (head), Gonzalo Pastor, Dalmacio Benicio, and Irene Yackovlev (all
AFR)—visited Gaborone June 1-14, 2010. Zeinab Partow (World Bank) also participated in some meetings.
Past advice. The 2009 Article IV consultation was concluded on July 20, 2009. The Fund commended the
authorities for prudent macroeconomic management, supported by strong institutions and good governance, but
warned that recent marked increases in public spending raised concerns about spending quality and fiscal
sustainability.
Exchange rate regime. Crawling peg, in which the pula is pegged to a basket of currencies comprising the SDR
and South African rand. The regime is implemented through continuous adjustment of the trade-weighted
nominal effective exchange rate of the pula at a rate of crawl based on the differential between Botswana’s
inflation objective and the forecast inflation of trading partner countries. The rate of crawl is thus determined
using a forward-looking approach and is revised on a regular basis. In this forward-looking scheme, the
authorities periodically determine the rate of crawl for the subsequent period, such as the next 6 or 12 months.
Data provision. Botswana participates in the General Data Dissemination System; data provision is adequate
for surveillance.
Consultation cycle. It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Botswana will take place on the
standard 12 month cycle.

STAFF APPRAISAL AND SUMMARY
1.
Botswana’s economy is rebounding after a significant setback following the global financial
crisis. The economy entered the crisis from a position of considerable strength because of past prudent
macroeconomic management. This facilitated a timely easing of fiscal and monetary policies, which helped
cushion the impact on growth of the crisis and the subsequent collapse in demand for diamonds. The
economy is likely to see some rebalancing beginning this year, as lower government spending dampens
growth in the nonmining sector while recovery of the diamond sector accelerates.
2.
Macroeconomic policies are being appropriately redirected away from short-term demand
management toward medium-term considerations.


Substantial fiscal consolidation will be needed as recovery proceeds, to put the public
finances back on a sustainable footing and to safeguard external stability. Much of the
adjustment will need to come from lower public spending, as mineral revenues are on a declining
trend; and the scope for raising nonmineral taxes is limited by the size of the private sector. The
budget for 2010/11 makes a good start on this process of adjustment. Plans to balance the budget by
2012/13 and register modest surpluses thereafter are ambitious but warranted. Recent increases in
public debt, and the more challenging fiscal environment going forward, will require a clearer
framework for management of the government’s assets and liabilities.



Anchoring inflation expectations will also be important, because inflation has not yet been
brought down sustainably within the authorities’ objective range of 3-6 percent. It will be important
therefore to err on the side of caution before proceeding with further reductions in interest rates and to
proceed with fiscal consolidation as envisaged.

3.
The medium-term outlook is favorable provided the authorities proceed with planned fiscal
consolidation. Staff projects that real GDP growth will average about 6 percent over the medium term, as
diamond production gradually recovers towards pre-crisis levels and investment in the power sector boosts
growth in the nonmining sector.
4.
Sustaining high growth rates will require an ambitious set of policies and reforms to create a
leaner and more effective public sector and promote private sector-led growth. The principle objectives
of this economic reform agenda should be:


Doing more with less. With the prospects of lower revenues looming over the medium-term fiscal
environment, the authorities will have to find ways to increase the value for money of public spending
programs. Doing so will require strengthening public financial management, including through a
transition to program-based budgeting and implementation of a medium-term expenditure framework.



Letting the private sector lead the way. Private sector-led growth will require structural reforms to
encourage entrepreneurship and investment. The focus should be mainly on cross-cutting structural
reforms that can benefit the whole economy. Current investments in power generation will address a
key bottleneck to growth. With appropriate safeguards, plans to privatize selected parastatals, greater
use of public–private partnerships, and rationalization of commercial services currently provided by
the government could also mobilize greater private sector participation in the economy.

4
I. CONTEXT: EMERGING FROM RECESSION
5.
Botswana is recovering from its worst recession in at least 40 years. The economy contracted by
3.7 percent last year as demand for diamonds collapsed in the wake of the global financial crisis. The prompt
easing of fiscal and monetary policies cushioned the impact of difficulties in the mining sector on the rest of the
economy such that the nonmining sector grew by a healthy 6.2 percent in 2009.

6.
The economy will likely see some rebalancing this year and next as mining continues its
gradual recovery while the nonmining sector decelerates as fiscal stimulus is withdrawn. Overall GDP
growth is projected to reach 8.4 percent in 2010, led by a rebound in diamond production. Nonmineral GDP
growth, however, is expected to slow somewhat to 4.8 percent. After breaching the upper ceiling of the Bank
of Botswana’s inflation objective of 3–6 percent owing to increases in the rate of value-added tax (VAT),
electricity tariffs and other administered prices, inflation is expected to fall within the objective band in mid-tolate 2011. The current account balance is set to improve gradually as recovery in the diamond market boosts
export receipts.

Calendar year.

Risks to the outlook are broadly balanced:


Diamond production is projected to recover gradually, in line with the moderate recovery of
consumption in advanced markets. However, a double-dip recession in advanced economies could
prompt a further collapse in the market whereas new demand from China and India could drive a
stronger recovery.

5


Developments in South Africa will also be important: the strength of recovery there will largely
determine the revenues that Botswana receives through Southern African Customs Union (SACU)
revenue-sharing arrangements. The prospects for additional investment in the power sector are also
tied to developments in South Africa (Box 1).



Internally, the resilience of the nonmining private sector to fiscal tightening will depend on whether the
government is able to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of spending within a tighter overall
spending envelope.
Box 1. Electricity-Generating Capacity: Addressing a Key Bottleneck to Growth
Botswana imports about 80 percent of its electricity from neighboring countries, principally South
Africa. The rest is generated by the 25-year-old Morupule plant, which is becoming increasingly
unreliable. As a result of the energy crisis in the region, neighboring countries are reducing their
exports to Botswana, resulting in power cuts. The Morupule plant is being expanded to achieve
energy generation self-sufficiency. Production is expected to begin in 2012. The feasibility of further
investments in Morupule and an additional large plant at Mmamabula, which would allow Botswana
to become a net exporter of electricity, depend on reaching power purchase agreements with South
Africa’s state-owned power utility. The likelihood of these agreements being reached is not clear and
additional investments have not therefore been incorporated in the staff baseline.

7.
Despite strong growth in recent years, social challenges are significant. Efforts to address
HIV/AIDS are beginning to pay off: life expectancy is improving in response to increased availability of antiretroviral drugs, and the rate of new HIV infections is declining. Nevertheless, the prevalence of HIV/AIDS is
among the highest in Africa (at a national prevalence rate of 17.6 percent according to the 2008 Botswana
AIDS Impact Study). Poverty, unemployment, and income inequality are also high, although outdated official
estimates make it difficult to assess the impact of recent developments.1
II. POLICIES: REBUILDING BUFFERS AND PROMOTING PRIVATE SECTOR LED GROWTH
With recovery now underway, policies are being appropriately redirected away from short-term demand
management towards medium-term considerations. Policy discussions focused on four key priorities: (i)
putting the public finances back onto a sustainable footing; (ii) locking in low inflation; (iii) improving the
management of public finances to enable the government to “do more with less”; and (iv) reinvigorating
structural reforms to encourage private sector-led growth.
A. Fiscal Policy: Restoring Sustainability After the Crisis
8.
Fiscal policy was strongly countercyclical during the past two years as the government
ramped up spending despite a drop in revenues. An ambitious roll out of development projects, including
building of schools, hospitals, airport facilities, roads, dams, stadia, and power generating infrastructure, has
seen development spending more than double in real terms in the past three years. The hiring of new teachers
and medical personnel, and the introduction in 2008/09 of a retention allowance for civil servants with scarce

According to the 2002/03 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES), the poverty rate was 30.3
percent. A new HIES is being conducted this year. Unemployment was recorded at 17.5 percent in the
2005/06 Labor Force Survey.

skills, also pushed up the wages and salaries bill despite a public-service salary freeze in 2009/10. As a result,
the nonmineral primary deficit—a good measure of the how fiscal policy affects the domestic economy—nearly
doubled from 16.7 percent of nonmineral GDP in 2007/08 to 32.9 percent in 2009/10.

9.
As recovery gets underway, significant fiscal consolidation will be needed to ensure fiscal and
external sustainability. Staff estimates that reducing the nonmineral primary deficit to about 11–12 percent of
nonmining GDP would preserve mineral wealth for future generations in real per capita terms and avoid the
need for a sharp adjustment in the public finances when diamond production begins to decline sharply towards
the middle of the next decade.2
10.
The bulk of adjustment will need to come from lower public spending. SACU revenues may
recover from temporarily low levels this year and next associated with repayments to the SACU Common
Revenue Pool (CRP), but are unlikely to return to the levels seen before the crisis when imports to the region
were booming (Box 2). Options for boosting non-SACU tax revenues include increasing specific duties on fuel,
which have lagged far behind increases in prices; broadening the base for VAT by reducing exemptions and
the number of zero-rated items; and taxing property. Tax administration could also be further improved by, for
example, establishing a large-taxpayers unit. But the scope for fully offsetting the decline in mineral and SACU
revenues is limited by the modest size of the nonmining private sector.
11.
The budget for 2010/11 makes a good start on this process of consolidation. Adjustment is
based on significant spending restraint, including a substantial cut in development spending as recent projects
approach completion and a public service salary freeze. The VAT rate has also been increased from 10 to 12
percent. The budget is consistent with an improvement in the nonmineral primary deficit to 26.7 percent of
nonmineral GDP. However, staff estimates that revenues could be higher than anticipated in the budget, in
which case the resulting overperformance should be saved in the form of a lower deficit.

2

This estimate is based on conservative assumptions about the value of diamond reserves, nonmineral
revenues, and the return on financial assets. It does not take into account potentially significant positive
returns from infrastructure spending and other investments.

7

Box 2. Southern African Customs Union Revenues
Customs and excise duties in the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) are pooled and
distributed according to a revenue-sharing formula. A key feature of these arrangements is that
distributions to member states from the Common Revenue Pool (CRP) are made on the basis of
projected revenue collections. Before the crisis, actual collections were higher than projected,
reflecting booming import growth in the region and resulting in windfall “adjustment payments” to
member states. Over the last two years, revenues (especially customs duty collections—see figure)
have been lower than anticipated such that Botswana and other member states are required to make
repayments to the CRP. This will temporarily reduce Botswana’s net receipts from the CRP in the
near term. Receipts should recover thereafter, though perhaps not to pre-crisis boom levels. SACU
member states have also recently agreed to review the revenue sharing formula.

The framework for managing the government’s assets and liabilities needs strengthening to
cope with a more challenging fiscal environment. Going into the crisis, public debt levels were negligible
and the government had accumulated substantial savings in the Pula Fund. Recent deficits have therefore
been comfortably financed through a combination of increased borrowing and drawing on savings. Gross
public debt, though still very low by international standards, increased to an estimated 14.5 percent of GDP by
March 2010 (or 17.7 percent of GDP including publicly guaranteed debt). The system for recording debt and
debt service obligations, however, is weak, and a clearly articulated medium-term debt strategy is not in place.
In Botswana’s circumstances, this strategy would best be determined within a broader framework for asset
and liability management (Box 3).
Box 3. A Framework for Asset and Liability Management
Botswana has a number of objectives in its management of assets and liabilities, including the need
to: (i) finance significant fiscal deficits in the short to medium term; (ii) manage substantial foreign
exchange assets and preserve wealth for future generations; and (iii) develop currently shallow
domestic capital markets for debt. There are also implications for monetary policy in terms of the role
of government debt and central bank paper in absorbing excess domestic liquidity. Decisions on how
best to meet these objectives would best be determined within a comprehensive framework for asset
and liability management. This needs to be supported by well-defined institutional arrangements,
including a clear division of responsibilities between the Ministry of Finance and Development
Planning and the Bank of Botswana.

3

The risk of a rapid decline in the government’s net asset position was among the factors prompting Standard
and Poor’s to downgrade Botswana by one notch to A- following the release of this year’s budget. Moody’s,
however, maintained its rating of A2.
4

The declining path for public debt to GDP in the staff baseline is robust to various shocks, though holding the
fiscal deficit constant at current levels results in an unsustainable debt path (See Informational Annex).

9
Authorities’ Views
14.
The authorities emphasized their commitment to restoring sustainability in public finances
over the medium term. Allowing large fiscal deficits to emerge was an exceptional response to an
unprecedented loss of national income and government revenue and helped to mitigate the adverse impact of
the economic downturn. The authorities concurred that spending levels were unsustainably high and indicated
that substantial reductions in expenditure over the next three years would form the basis for achieving a
balanced budget by 2012/13. Spending would shift toward maintaining existing infrastructure, and capital
spending would decrease from recent exceptionally high levels. Recurrent spending would be held in check, in
part by allowing no net new hiring into the public service.
15.
The authorities indicated that they were seeking to improve tax collection in a number of areas.
The VAT threshold has been increased, which will simplify administration. A budget proposal to abolish the
current two tier corporate tax system would also be an additional simplification. The authorities have embarked
upon a three-year program, with the support of the Swedish tax authorities, to modernize and increase the
efficiency of tax administration. They agreed that there was some scope for broadening the tax base, for
example by reducing the numbers of goods and services that are zero rated or exempt from VAT. They also
shared the staff’s concern that tax incentives do little to encourage additional new investment and activity but
risk significantly eroding fiscal space. In both cases, however, they noted that the pressure from business was
for more exemptions and incentives.
16.
The authorities are reviewing fiscal rules that might help to ensure fiscal discipline. They
acknowledged that the spending ceiling of 40 percent of GDP introduced in 2006 is too high to keep spending
at sustainable levels. While agreeing that the nonmineral primary deficit is a useful measure of the fiscal
stance, which they would monitor, the authorities noted that they would continue to focus on the overall
balance. The authorities’ targeted overall balance is broadly consistent with staff’s estimate of the sustainable
nonmineral primary balance over the medium term.
17.
Having recently completed a two-year domestic debt issuance program, the authorities are
planning to announce a medium-term debt strategy within the next few months. They have been
working with the World Bank to develop the strategy and have also received support from the Commonwealth
Secretariat on debt recording. They agreed that the institutional structure for debt management needs
strengthening: there is a debt management unit within the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning, but
its capacity is weak. They also saw the merits of a comprehensive framework for asset and liability
management, which could build on existing reform efforts.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies: Locking in Low Inflation
18.
Monetary policy has been eased as inflation decelerated towards the upper end of the Bank of
Botswana’s 3–6 percent objective range. Inflation fell from a peak of 15 percent in late-2008 to an average
6 percent between September 2009 and March 2010, as a sharp deceleration in food price inflation more than
offset increases in international fuel prices. The disinflation process also reflects lower imported inflation from
South Africa, which is Botswana’s main source for consumer goods. The expansion of monetary and credit
aggregates slowed, with quarterly private credit growth briefly turning negative in mid-2009 in response to
weaker demand for borrowing and a tightening in banks’ lending standards before recovering toward the end
of the year. In response, the Bank of Botswana reduced policy rates by 550 basis points to 10 percent, broadly
in line with policy easing in South Africa.

10
19.
Inflation has accelerated recently in response to temporary factors but should fall back within
the objective range during 2011. Inflation increased to 7.8 percent in May 2010 because of higher VAT and
a 30 percent adjustment in electricity tariffs. The rate may increase a little further in the coming months, in
response to additional administered price increases, before falling back within the objective range during 2011.
This is contingent on fiscal consolidation proceeding as anticipated.

Inflation has not yet been brought within the Bank of Botswana’s objective range for a
sustained period; monetary and exchange rate policies will therefore need to be calibrated to ensure
that inflation expectations become more firmly anchored. The business survey measure of inflation
expectations has declined but remains high at around 10 percent; and market participants indicate that
lingering concerns about inflation partly explained limited demand for long-dated government bonds at prices
close to benchmark rates on South African bonds of similar maturity. Anchoring inflation expectations well
inside the objective band would promote domestic savings and help to reduce borrowing costs (including for
government). With this in mind, it will be important to err on the side of caution before proceeding with further
reductions in interest rates. It will be similarly important to continue to take a forward-looking approach when
determining the rate of crawl for the exchange rate to ensure that it contributes to meeting the inflation
objective rather than accommodating past inflation. Publishing the basket weights and rate of crawl could also
contribute to anchoring market expectations.
21.
Exchange rate policy continues to be implemented through the crawling peg regime. The
annual rate of crawl is determined on based on the

fiscal consolidation proceeds as anticipated and that
the budget balance returns to a moderate surplus over the medium term. However, in the event of significant
fiscal slippage, or a sustained structural weakening in demand for diamonds, the resources in the Pula Fund
would be drained; and the exchange rate peg would be under pressure.

11
Authorities’ Views
23.
The authorities anticipate that inflation will fall back within the objective range on a sustained
basis by mid-2011. Benign external price pressures and subdued domestic demand will help to keep
underlying inflationary pressures in check. They noted that the survey of business expectations of inflation was
based on a small sample but agreed that inflation expectations were likely above the 3–6 percent objective
range. The public service salary freeze could play an important signaling role and help to curb private sector
wage settlements. Continued regular communication of the strategy for bringing inflation within the 3–6
percent band would also help to anchor expectations. The authorities are continuing to refine their inflation
forecasting framework but are not yet ready to move to formal inflation targeting as the sole anchor for
monetary policy which, they agree, would also require greater exchange rate flexibility.
24.
The authorities considered the current level of the real exchange rate broadly appropriate, but
agreed that a sustained structural shift in the external position could change this assessment. They
also noted that, over the longer run, durable international competitiveness would depend on productivity
improvements.
C. Financial Policies: Maintaining Stability
25.
The banking system remains fundamentally sound though recent increases in nonperforming
loans in the household sector warrant vigilance on the part of supervisors. The impact of the global
financial crisis on the banking sector was largely indirect. Banks are not significantly exposed to the mining
sector, which finances itself largely through retained
earnings or foreign parent companies. However,

banks are heavily exposed to households, which

provisions and tightening lending standards. As a result, profitability has declined though it remains high by
international standards. Bank capital levels also remain well above the statutory 8 percent floor and prescribed
prudential standard of 15 percent.

Some of the bank lending to households may be for small businesses.

26.
Regulation of nonbank financial institutions is being strengthened as the Non-Bank Financial
Institutions Regulatory Authority (NBFIRA) ramps up its activities. Non-bank financial institutions are a
significant component of the financial system. The combined assets of pension and insurance companies
account for 49.5 percent of GDP (compared with 41 percent of GDP for the banking sector’s assets). NBFIRA
was established in April 2008 and assumed full responsibility for regulating and supervising non-bank financial
institutions in September 2009. Revisions to the Insurance and Pension Fund Acts, and accompanying
prudential regulations, are going through industry consultation with implementation expected later this year.
There is, however, a gap in the current regulatory framework, for micro lenders, that needs to be plugged
expeditiously.
Authorities’ Views
27.
The authorities agreed that concentration of bank lending on the retail sector was a concern
and indicated that they would continue to monitor the sector closely. Banks responded promptly and
appropriately to elevated risks in the sector by raising provisions and tightening lending standards. The
authorities indicated that they are committed to adopting Basel II prudential standards but also noted that the
four largest banks (which account for over 90 percent of bank assets) are internationally owned and are at an
advanced stage of Basel II implementation. They agreed that there was a need to develop a regulatory and
supervisory framework for the micro lending sector and indicated that draft regulations have been prepared
accordingly. NBFIRA is also working with development partners to develop a framework of risk-based
supervision for non-banks, in line with international best practice. More broadly, the authorities are also
planning to develop a financial stability framework for monitoring risks in the financial sector and resolving
financial crises and, as a first step, the Bank of Botswana has reorganized its structure to include the
establishment of a Financial Stability Division in the Bank.

13
D. Reforming Public Finances and Supporting Private Sector-Led Growth:
“Doing More with Less”
28.
The global financial crisis has underscored the economy’s vulnerability to external shocks and
the need to develop a more diversified and

rates have declined steadily as the impetus from

programs—also has run its course. Returns to public

spending levels, outcomes (for example, educational

years
countries (see Appendix 2). A large public sector,
Source: IMF World Economic Outlook; based on Hausmann and Klinger (2010)
employing over 40 percent of the formal workforce and
paying wages that, on average, are almost two-thirds
higher than in the private sector, is exerting upward pressure on costs in the entire economy, particularly given
a constrained skills base.
29.
Changing the way in which the public finances are managed will help to ensure that the public
sector can support broad-based growth in the economy. There is a need for greater emphasis on
expenditure prioritization and improvements in public financial management, including a transition to programbased budgeting and the adoption of a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework. This would help to mitigate a
potential adverse impact on economic growth as public spending transitions to lower, more sustainable levels.
Extra-budgetary and special funds, which in some cases are no longer serving their original purposes, also
impede the efficiency of resource allocation within the budget and undermine transparency and accountability
in government spending. These funds could be phased out or, at a minimum, their activities more
transparently reported in the fiscal accounts and budget documentation. Many of these ideas have been under
consideration in Botswana for some time.6 But the need to move forward with reforms has become more
pressing as the fiscal environment has become more challenging.
30.
Reflecting this, the budget for 2010/11 underscores the importance of transforming the role of
the public sector in the economy and the need to focus on more efficient and effective ways of
delivering public services. With this in mind, the authorities have established a task force to develop a plan
for public financial management reform. Steps envisaged in this area include introduction of results-based
budgeting, implementation of a medium-term framework for budget formulation, and a move toward accrual
accounting.

6

These issues are highlighted in IMF Technical Assistance reports on public financial management (2005,
2010); a Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment (2009); and, most recently,
World Bank Public Expenditure Review (2010).

14
31.
Further improvements to the business climate and other reforms to encourage private sector
development will also be important:


Current investment in electricity generating capacity will help to address a key bottleneck to growth.
Recent efforts to speed up the time it takes to register and license a business are also welcome. Other
cross-cutting interventions that have the potential to further improve the business environment for the
whole economy, such as speeding up the process for approving work permits, could also be explored
(see Appendix 1).



A number of initiatives have been launched to promote economic activity in specific areas where
returns are thought likely to be high, including the establishment of “hubs” for agriculture, innovation,
diamonds, education, health, and transport. When pursuing sector-specific interventions, it is
important that these be transparent, subject to periodic independent evaluations to guard against rentseeking by vested interests, and include clear criteria for discontinuing ineffective support.



Efforts are also underway to mobilize private sector financing and entrepreneurship through, for
example, privatization of selected parastatals (starting this year with Botswana Telecommunications
Corporation) and outsourcing of some commercial activities currently provided “in-house” by
government. A framework for public–private partnerships (PPPs) was established in June 2009 and a
PPP unit to coordinate activity in this area is being established within the Ministry of Finance and
Development Planning. It will be important that appropriate legal and regulatory frameworks are in
place to ensure that fiscal risks are mitigated and value for money is maximized.

Authorities’ Views
32.
The authorities agreed that their development model would need to change. Stimulating private
sector growth by creating additional infrastructure has become less relevant over time as a once large
infrastructure gap has been closed. Reflecting this, the latest National Development Plan (NDP10), covering
the period 2009–16, emphasizes the creation of a leaner more effective public sector, thereby reducing
crowding out of the private sector, while at the same time seeking to support private sector activity through
regulatory and other structural reforms. A major effort will be made during NDP10 to reduce regulatory
burdens that hinder investment. For example, revisions to the Immigration and Citizenship and Employment of
Non-Citizens Act will provide an opportunity to improve Botswana’s skills base.

Appendix 1. Exchange Rate Assessment
Assessment of Botswana’s exchange rate is based on the IMF’s Consultative Group on Exchange Rate Issues
(CGER) methodology, adapted for Botswana’s circumstances.
Macroeconomic balance approach: Using coefficients relating current account balances to macroeconomic
fundamentals, estimated from a sample of low- and middle-income countries, yields a current account norm
for Botswana of 5.5 to 4.8 percent of GDP in 2015, depending on the precise model specification. This
compares with an underlying current account balance in Botswana (measured by the projected current
account balance in 2015 in the staff baseline, by which point temporary factors and exogenous shocks have
dissipated) of 5.1 percent of GDP. The elasticity of the current account relative to the real effective exchange
rate is assumed to be -0.5 based on estimated import and export elasticities for Botswana. This suggests that,
by 2015, the exchange rate is expected to be in line with equilibrium under the baseline scenario, deviating by
less than 0.5 percent. Under an alternative scenario where the fiscal position does not recover and the current
account remains negative, the model predicts an overvaluation of 9 to 10 percent by 2015.
Equilibrium real exchange rate approach: This approach estimates the level of the equilibrium real
exchange rate based on macroeconomic fundamentals (for example, relative productivity, real interest rate
differentials, terms of trade, and government consumption). It suggests that, as of March 2010, the exchange
rate was overvalued by about 7 percent, although the confidence intervals around this estimate are large.

External sustainability approach: Following previous work on Botswana, this approach calculates the norm
current account balance consistent with a buildup of net foreign assets that takes into account the need to
accumulate savings ahead of declining diamond receipts.7 The resulting “sustainable current account balance”
is calculated as about 7.3 percent of GDP in 2015, compared with staff’s projected underlying current account
balance of 5.1 percent of GDP. Using the same elasticities as in the macroeconomic balance approach
suggests that the exchange rate is overvalued by about 4 percent.

Structural measures of competitiveness suggest that Botswana continues to lead a large number of
countries in the world in various aspects of political and economic governance. But challenges persist.
Entrepreneurs in Botswana must overcome a high cost of trading across its borders and dealing with
construction permits, and difficulties in employing workers and enforcing contracts.

Appendix 2. Diminishing Returns to Public Expenditure8
Botswana’s rapid economic growth during the 1970s and 1980s was largely the result of high public
investment in human and physical capital. The associated gains in terms of the building of basic
infrastructure and the provision of health, education, and other services—where virtually none existed at
independence in 1966—are remarkable. Over time, however, public investment has become less efficient in
promoting long-term growth. Returns have declined as the public sector has grown and engaged in a widening
range of public investment that extends well beyond the provision of core public goods. Simultaneously, the
attention paid to project appraisal and evaluation has weakened as project implementation capacity has
become stretched and buoyant diamond revenues and repeated budget surpluses relaxed the government
budget constraint. The postponement of maintenance expenditures and a loose definition of what constitutes
investment have further debilitated the quality and efficiency of public investment spending.

Education is one area where returns to public spending appear to be lower than in some other middleincome countries. Botswana allocates nearly a quarter of its annual public spending to education, and
spending per student is significantly higher than in other middle-income countries. High rates of literacy and
enrollment in secondary schools have been among the system’s accomplishments. However, less than 60
percent of those enrolling in secondary school complete their schooling. Other measures of educational
attainment are also no better than average compared with other countries in the region despite higher
spending. Costs are also increasing, as measured by the high and rising implicit price deflator for education
services.
Social safety nets are another area where value for money appears weak. Social safety net programs
account for about 10 percent of government spending, or 3-4 percent of GDP, and are designed to address
risks related to malnutrition, HIV/AIDS, unemployment, disability, and old age. However, they cover only a
small portion of the poor (19 percent) and many beneficiaries are nonpoor households (57 percent). Better and
more regular information (for example, poverty assessments and household income and expenditure surveys)
is needed to improve targeting of beneficiaries.

Expenditure Review (2010).

The large size of the public sector is undermining the competitiveness of the economy as a whole, by
increasing costs, particularly wages. Government spending, averaging 35 percent of GDP during the past
decade, is among the largest in Africa. The public sector outbids the private sector for available labor, exerting
upward pressure on economy-wide labor costs, and contributes to high unit labor costs and unemployment.
While government workers constitute 40 percent of the total formal workforce, they claim more than 54 percent
of total wages paid. The reservation wage that workers demand before accepting employment has risen as
workers expect salaries significantly higher than the market clearing levels in the non-government sectors of
the economy.

III. STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of June, 2010
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Macroeconomic data are adequate for surveillance, but some shortcomings exist in terms of
accuracy and reliability of the source data and the statistical techniques used in the compilation of
national accounts, government finance, and balance of payments statistics. The timeliness of the central
bank survey and detailed government expenditure data by economic classification needs to be increased
to better support economic analysis and prepare Botswana for an eventual subscription to the Special
Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). Further improvements would include dissemination of readily
available information on monthly production of diamonds and quarterly aggregate financial soundness
indicators.
The authorities are working on a number of fronts to improve data quality and dissemination: (i) source
data and methodologies are being reviewed for those data with obvious estimation problems/gaps, (ii)
stronger collaboration is being sought among source data producers to secure consistency and reconcile
discrepancies across data sets; (iii) the production of leading economic indicators is currently
underway; and (iv) staff shortages are being addressed within budget constraints.
National Accounts: National accounts estimation has not kept pace with changes to the structure of the
economy and needs to be rebased (the current base year is 1993/94). The Household Income and
Expenditure Survey (HIES) (2002/03) and Labor Force Survey (2005/06) are out of date. More
frequent surveys would support a more robust estimation of private consumption and a better
understanding of poverty and unemployment.
Price Statistics: The official monthly consumer price index (CPI) is available on a timely basis in the
CSO’s website. The index is comprehensive and provides breakdowns between urban and rural price
data, and between prices of tradable (domestic and imported) and nontradable goods and services.
Estimates from an outdated HIES are currently used for the weights of market expenditure for goods
and services. Compilation challenges include undertaking a new HIES (ongoing) and the eventual
inclusion of owner-occupied housing price data in the CPI. Compilation of producer or wholesale
prices has been discontinued.
Government Finance Statistics: The concepts and definitions used in compiling government finance
statistics generally follow the guidelines of the IMF’s 1986 Government Finance Statistics Manual
(GFSM 1986) but cover only budgetary central government activities. No fiscal statistics are compiled
for extra budgetary institutions, consolidated central government, or consolidated general government.
No decision has been made by the authorities on adopting a “migration path” to the GFSM 2001
methodology. Recurrent and development expenditure data are published in an aggregate form.
Development spending comprises a mixture of current and capital spending.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Compilation practices are consistent with the Fund’s Monetary
and Financial Statistics Manual. The central bank survey is currently available with a lag of about three
months, which is well short of the two-week period recommended in the SDDS. STA’s
recommendation is to make preliminary data available with clear identification of data status. The
authorities prefer a more cautious approach to data dissemination to avoid reputation damage if the data
require revisions. The BoB is seeking to expand the coverage of financial statistics to include the
operations of nonbank financial intermediaries (NBFI), such as pension funds, insurance companies,
and other financial corporations, such as unit trusts, finance companies, and financial auxiliaries. STA’s
recommendation is to focus on data collection in a handful of large institutions within each NBFI
category.

7
Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Statistics: Annual and quarterly
balance of payments data are published in the Botswana Financial Statistics (BF) and the BoB’s Annual
Report. Preliminary data are generally disseminated within two months of the end of the reporting
period, while revised (final) data are available after nine months. The concepts, structure, and
definitions of the balance of payments statistics follow the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments
Statistics Manual (BPM5). Source data are adequate, but the International Transaction Reporting
System (ITRS) data—as opposed to alternative survey data on services and transfer items in the current
account—has become unreliable. Data compilation, estimation, and adjustments mostly employ sound
techniques, but the methods used for estimating missing data (for example, unrecorded trade), f.o.b.
/c.i.f. adjustment factors to import values, and flows from stock data are inadequate. Discrepancies exist
in national accounts data concerning: (i) the valuation of diamond exports and (ii) imports, exports,
and payments related to settlements within the Southern African Customs Union (SACU). Large errors
and omissions in the 2009 balance of payments statistics have complicated the assessment of external
sustainability.
The BoB conducts an annual survey of Botswana’s investment and international investment position
(IIP). A quarterly IIP survey is also produced for internal use with data from the ITRS.
External Debt: Public external debt data are of good quality and but timeliness could be improved (the
latest published data is for March 2009).
II. Data Standards and Quality
Botswana has participated in the GDDS since late 2002. A Data ROSC and its updates were published
in April 2002, March 2004, and April 2007, respectively.
III. Reporting to STA
Monetary data are reported for publication in International Financial Statistics using Standardized
Report Forms. No government financial statistics are currently reported for publication in the
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook.

IV. MEDIUM-TERM PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS1
Botswana’s gross public debt rose sharply to 15 percent of GDP in 2009/10 albeit from a
very low base. Under the staff baseline scenario, the public debt ratio-to-GDP increases to
17.6 percent of GDP in 2010/11 before falling to 10.5 percent of GDP by 2015/16. However,
as the government draws on its savings to finance fiscal deficits in the near term, its net asset
position declines from 39.1 percent of GDP in 2009 to 20.8 percent of GDP in 2012 before
increasing gradually thereafter. This declining path for public debt is robust to various
shocks, though holding the fiscal deficit constant at current levels results in an unsustainable
debt path, underscoring the need for substantial expenditure reduction.
Botswana’s gross public debt rose sharply from US$0.7 billion (6.2 percent of GDP) in
2008/09 to about US$2 billion (15 percent of GDP) in 2009/10. About 72 percent of the debt
is owed to bilateral and multilateral foreign creditors, while the rest is domestic debt.
Botswana has had a historically low level of public debt, thanks to prudent fiscal policies,
which has led to fiscal surpluses and a significant accumulation of government reserves
including the Pula Fund. However, the global financial crisis and the resulting lower demand
for diamonds have contributed to a sharp decline in government mineral revenues. This,
combined with a significant rise in public spending, resulted in a fiscal deficit of 14.2 percent
of GDP in FY 2009/10, which was financed through a drawdown in reserves, a budget
support loan from the African Development Bank (AfDB) of US$1.5 billion (of which
US$1 billion has so far been drawn), and other borrowing.
The baseline scenario underlying the macroeconomic framework assumes that revenue and
grants increase from a low of 31.6 percent of GDP in 2009/10 and stabilize at around
37 percent of GDP in the medium term. Primary expenditure is projected to fall as recent
stimulus spending is unwound and as ongoing infrastructure projects are completed. As a
result, the overall balance gradually improves to a surplus of 4.7 percent of GDP in 2015/16.
Staff assumes that about one-third of the deficits from 2010/11 through 2012/13 will be
financed by domestic borrowing with the remaining two-thirds financed by drawing down
savings in the Pula Fund. As a result, gross debt-to-GDP is projected to fall to 10.5 percent of
GDP by 2015/16.

declining from 39.1 percent of GDP in 2009/10 to 20.8 percent of GDP in 2012/13 before
recovering to 25.1 percent of GDP by 2015/16.
Table 1 presents two additional scenarios. The first scenario shows the fiscal outcome if real
GDP growth, real interest rates, and the primary balance are maintained at their historical 10year averages. In this case, the public debt-to-GDP ratio would drop to 8.7 percent of GDP
by 2013/14, reflecting strong economic growth and the prudent fiscal stance in the recent
past. The second scenario shows the outcome if the government’s policies remain unchanged
from 2010/11, in the sense that the fiscal balance is held constant at its 2010/11 level. In this
case, debt indicators would worsen considerably, with public debt rising to 56.3 percent of
GDP by the end of the forecast period, underscoring the downside risk of delay or failure to
reduce expenditure to sustainable levels.
The bounds tests illustrate the sensitivity of the fiscal position to exogenous shocks
(Figure 1). The debt-to-GDP ratio would increase by between 1 to 17 percentage points of
GDP depending on the shock. The most benign shock is that from the real interest rate, which
results in a 4 percentage points increase in the debt-to- GDP ratio relative to the baseline
scenario, while a worsening in the 10 year historical average primary balance by one
standard deviation results in a 17 percentage points increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio.

The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as (1+r).
For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.

V. MEDIUM-TERM EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS1
Botswana’s gross external debt
increased from $0.4 billion (3.2 percent
of GDP) in 2008 to $1.9 billion
(15.4 percent of GDP) at the end of
2009. The increase largely reflects
increased external borrowing by the
public sector to finance a large fiscal
deficit as well as (governmentguaranteed) borrowing by the
Botswana Power Corporation to
finance the expansion of the Morupule
power plant. As a result, public and
publicly-guaranteed debt rose six-fold
between end-2008 and end-2009, to
14.1 percent of GDP.

Sources: Bank of Botswana and Fund staff estimates.

After a sharp rise last year due to the deterioration in the fiscal and current account balances,
external debt should stabilize this year at 15.9 percent of GDP under the baseline scenario.
The fiscal and current account balances should return to a surplus by 2011, at which time
external debt should also begin to decline steadily. Consistent with the macroeconomic
framework, the recovery in the baseline scenario is predicated on a rebound in diamond
exports and declining imports as the power plant projects near completion. Risks to the
baseline include higher than envisaged investment in power projects, a substantial element of
which would be financed through external borrowing, or a delay of the planned fiscal
consolidation.
Simulations suggest that Botswana’s external debt-to-GDP ratio is robust to growth interest
rate, and currency shocks. It appears more susceptible to a current account shock and to a
combination of growth, interest rate and current account shocks. The ratio could rise
significantly in the event of a current account shock, but would still remain below 30 percent
of GDP. However, neither scenario is very likely under current circumstances absent a
further collapse in the diamond market.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Botswana
On July 27, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Botswana on a lapse of time basis. Under the IMF’s lapse of time
procedures, the Executive Board completes the Article IV consultations without convening
formal discussions.1
Background
Botswana is recovering from its worst recession in at least 40 years. The economy contracted
by 3.7 percent last year as demand for diamonds collapsed in the wake of the global financial
crisis. The prompt easing of fiscal and monetary policies cushioned the impact of difficulties in
the mining sector on the rest of the economy such that the nonmining sector grew by a healthy
6.2 percent in 2009. The domestic banking system has remained profitable, liquid and well
capitalized, although there have been some recent increases in nonperforming loans to
households.
The economy will likely see some rebalancing this year and next as mining continues its gradual
recovery while the nonmining sector decelerates as fiscal stimulus is withdrawn. Overall GDP
growth is projected to reach 8.4 percent in 2010, led by a rebound in diamond production.
Nonmineral GDP growth, however, is expected to slow somewhat to 4.8 percent. Inflation

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

increased to 7.8 percent in May 2010 because of increases in the rate of value added tax (VAT)
and adjustments in administered prices. It may increase a little further in the coming months, in
response to additional administered price increases, before falling back within the Bank of
Botswana’s inflation objective of 3–6 percent in mid-to-late 2011. The current account balance
is set to improve gradually as recovery in the diamond market boosts export receipts.
Risks to the outlook are broadly balanced. A double-dip recession in advanced economies
could trigger renewed difficulties in the diamond market. In contrast, new demand from China
and India could drive a stronger recovery in the diamonds sector. Developments in South Africa
will also be important as the strength of South Africa’s recovery will largely determine the
revenues that Botswana receives through the Southern African Customs Union (SACU)
revenue-sharing arrangement. The prospects for additional investment in the power sector are
also tied to developments in South Africa.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2010 Article IV consultation with Botswana, Executive Directors endorsed the
staff’s appraisal, as follows:
Botswana’s economy is rebounding after a significant setback following the global financial
crisis. The economy entered the crisis from a position of considerable strength because of past
prudent macroeconomic management. This facilitated a timely easing of fiscal and monetary
policies, which helped cushion the impact on growth of the crisis and the subsequent collapse in
demand for diamonds. The economy is likely to see some rebalancing beginning this year, as
lower government spending dampens growth in the nonmining sector while recovery of the
diamond sector accelerates.
Macroeconomic policies are being appropriately redirected away from short-term demand
management toward medium-term considerations. Substantial fiscal consolidation will be
needed as recovery proceeds, to put the public finances back on a sustainable footing and to
safeguard external stability. Much of the adjustment will need to come from lower public
spending, as mineral revenues are on a declining trend; and the scope for raising nonmineral
taxes is limited by the size of the private sector. The budget for 2010/11 makes a good start on
this process of adjustment. Plans to balance the budget by 2012/13 and register modest
surpluses thereafter are ambitious but warranted. Recent increases in public debt, and the more
challenging fiscal environment going forward, will require a clearer framework for management
of the government’s assets and liabilities. Anchoring inflation expectations will also be
important, because inflation has not yet been brought down sustainably within the authorities’
objective range of 3-6 percent. It will be important therefore to err on the side of caution before
proceeding with further reductions in interest rates and to proceed with fiscal consolidation as
envisaged.
The medium-term outlook is favorable provided the authorities proceed with planned fiscal
consolidation. Staff projects that real GDP growth will average about 6 percent over the medium
term, as diamond production gradually recovers towards pre-crisis levels and investment in the
power sector boosts growth in the nonmining sector.

3
Sustaining high growth rates will require an ambitious set of policies and reforms to create a
leaner and more effective public sector and promote private sector-led growth. The principle
objectives of this economic reform agenda should be: Doing more with less. With the prospects
of lower revenues looming over the medium-term fiscal environment, the authorities will have to
find ways to increase the value for money of public spending programs. Doing so will require
strengthening public financial management, including through a transition to program-based
budgeting and implementation of a medium-term expenditure framework. Letting the private
sector lead the way. Private sector-led growth will require structural reforms to encourage
entrepreneurship and investment. The focus should be mainly on cross-cutting structural
reforms that can benefit the whole economy. Current investments in power generation will
address a key bottleneck to growth. With appropriate safeguards, plans to privatize selected
parastatals, greater use of public–private partnerships, and rationalization of commercial
services currently provided by the government could also mobilize greater private sector
participation in the economy.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
