ST. LUCIA
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2007 Consultation with St. Lucia
Approved by Markus Rodlauer and Matthew Fisher
September 7, 2007
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Achievements and challenges: Since 2001, a revival in tourism-related services and construction
activity has led to an acceleration in real GDP growth. Inflation remains low, underpinned by the
regional currency board arrangement. While public debt is the lowest among Eastern Caribbean
Currency Union countries, it is still about 67 percent of GDP, and the fiscal situation has weakened in
recent years. In addition, St. Lucia faces structural challenges (including inadequate infrastructure and
high unemployment) that need to be addressed to raise growth durably and reduce poverty.
Outlook and risks: In the near term, economic activity is expected to soften due to a slowdown in
tourism and construction. With growing pressure for capital and social spending, there is a risk that
current fiscal policies will lead to an unsustainable level of public debt. There is also some political
uncertainty surrounding the succession to the ailing Prime Minister (Sir John Compton), who is
expected to demit office by end-2007.
Focus: The discussions focused on the principal challenges facing St. Lucia:
● Enhancing growth prospects. The authorities and staff agreed that restoring higher levels of growth
on a sustained basis will require careful management of tourism development and sustained structural
reforms aimed at broadening the economic base. There was broad consensus on the requirements,
including the acceleration of structural reforms, review of the investment incentives regime, enhanced
labor market flexibility, and steps to improve the investment climate.
● Ensuring debt sustainability and fiscal consolidation. To restore fiscal and debt sustainability, staff
advocated a front-loaded effort at fiscal adjustment of about ¾ of 1 percent of GDP in FY 2007/08, to
be achieved mainly through prioritization of capital spending. Over the medium term, fiscal
consolidation will involve broadening the tax base through enhanced pass-through of international oil
prices to retail fuel prices, the introduction of a value-added tax and market valuation-based property
tax, containment of expenditure on wages and salaries, elimination of low-priority capital projects, and
enhanced debt management. The authorities concurred with the need to enhance the efficiency of
budgetary spending, including the introduction of a formal public sector investment program (PSIP)
mechanism, but emphasized the need for fiscal policy to be supportive of their plans to scale up
investment in tourism-related public infrastructure and thereby attract foreign direct investment flows.
● Reducing vulnerabilities to shocks. Reforms to improve the economy’s resilience to potential
shocks include strengthening hurricane preparedness, and bolstering social safety nets. The authorities
have taken steps to strengthen financial sector supervision, but there has been slow progress in
establishing a single regulatory agency for supervision of nonbank financial institutions.

I. BACKGROUND1
1.
St. Lucia is a small, open, tourism-based economy that is highly vulnerable to
exogenous shocks. Tourism accounts for almost three-quarters of exports, and the import
content of consumption and investment is high. While the share of value added from the
traditionally-dominant agriculture sector has declined sharply in recent decades, crops
(particularly bananas) remain important in supporting the incomes of the country’s large rural
population.
2.
St. Lucia’s growth rate declined from about 7 percent in the 1980s to 2 percent
in the 1990s and 2000s (Figure 1). The main cause of the slowdown was declining banana
exports, due to rising costs and the erosion of European Union trade preferences. Output
growth has rebounded since 2001, mainly from tourism, and more recently as a result of
Cricket World Cup (CWC)-related construction activities.
3.
The fiscal position strengthened in the mid-2000s, but has deteriorated in recent
years (Figure 2). Expansionary budgets in 2000–02 sharply raised the fiscal deficit and debtto-GDP ratio. In subsequent years the authorities strengthened fiscal management by
tightening revenue administration and containing capital expenditure. However, the fiscal
position weakened sharply in FY 2005/06, owing to CWC-related capital expenditures.
Public debt stands at about 67 percent of GDP in FY 2006/07—nearly twice the level of a
decade ago, albeit still the lowest in the ECCU.
4.
St. Lucia has strong social
indicators. A 2004 welfare survey
indicated near-universal adult literacy,
strong health outcomes, and good
access to social services. However,
unemployment has remained high at
around 16 percent, particularly among
the young and women. One-fourth of
the population lives in poverty, and
crime is a growing concern.

deposits have grown in recent years,
signaling an increase in balance sheet vulnerabilities. Nonbank financial intermediaries,
whose deposits amount to about one-fifth of bank deposits, remain under-regulated despite
their systemic importance.
13.
The political environment for reform remains challenging. Elections in
December 2006 returned the United Workers Party, led by former Prime Minister
Sir John Compton, to office after ten years in opposition. The Prime Minister suffered a
series of strokes in April 2007, has not resumed his duties, and is expected to demit office by
end-2007. His long-term absence has raised uncertainty about the political outlook and his
successorship, complicating policy formulation and implementation.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Overview
14.
The principal policy challenge for the new government is to broaden the bases of
economic growth, while addressing debt sustainability and other vulnerabilities. The
public debt stock is high, constraining expenditure on poverty-reduction and social programs
and reducing the fiscal room for maneuver in the event of an adverse exogenous shock.

7
Accordingly, given relatively limited fiscal space to undertake high-cost capital projects,
staff cautioned against the planned acceleration in capital expenditure. While the authorities
agreed on the need to raise growth, they did not see major risks in their fiscal plans,
especially those related to acceleration in capital expenditures, given their desire to expand
tourism infrastructure and to reduce poverty. Policy discussions were organized around three
key areas:
•

Enhancing growth prospects and reducing poverty, through measures to diversify the
bases of economic growth and to raise the efficiency of capital and social spending;

•

Ensuring debt sustainability and fiscal consolidation, through steps to broaden the tax
base and contain public investment spending; and

•

Reducing vulnerabilities, including the erosion of banana trade preferences and the
country’s proneness to natural disasters.
B. Enhancing Growth Prospects and Poverty Reduction

15.
Notwithstanding the recent economic recovery, substantial challenges lie ahead,
as near-term growth prospects have weakened and unemployment remains high.
Restoring higher levels of growth on a sustained basis will require careful management of
tourism development, and sustained structural reforms aimed at broadening the economic
base and ensuring that the private sector is the main engine of economic activity.
16.
Tourism development needs to be based on a long-term plan that considers
related policies and needs for infrastructure and services. There was broad agreement
among the mission’s interlocutors that ongoing expansion in stayover capacity presents a
number of challenges if it is to be utilized fully and yield a wider economic return. These
include the capacity to supply water, power, roads, training, security, airlift and other
services. In response to these challenges, the authorities have formulated a National
Development Plan that was presented to international donors and private sector investors in
July 2007.4 Underpinning the plan is a strategy to invest heavily in tourism-related
infrastructure in order to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) on a large scale, which if
successful would accelerate the country’s growth potential. In this context, the authorities
insisted that the proposed public investment projects should not be viewed in isolation from
their overall strategy of attracting FDI. They argued that such a policy initiative is key to
escaping from St. Lucia’s rising debt and low growth dynamics. The authorities also intend
to modify the incentives regime, by offering tax incentives in return for equity ownership.

4

The authorities held an international development conference in Castries during July 23–25, 2007, with a
view to securing finance for their development plans.

this connection, the mission welcomed
the government’s plans to privatize the country’s water supply company (WASCO) by end2008.

18.
The government could also take other measures to enhance productivity and
efficiency, including:
•

Review of the investment incentives regime. Generous tax incentives have encouraged
well-established firms to repeatedly seek extension of tax concessions (mainly tax
holidays) for their existing investments.5 The mission recommended consideration of
alternative policies to encourage investment. For example, a less costly and more
transparent framework would provide incentives only on the amount of new
investment—preferably based on accelerated depreciation, tax credits and time-bound
loan-loss provisions.

•

Improving the investment
climate. In line with other
ECCU countries, private
domestic investment has
stagnated in recent years
(except for the sharp up tick
in the last two CWC-related
years), mainly as a result of
high real interest rates, the
lack of equity finance, and
an unfavorable tax regime.6

9
While St. Lucia is ranked first among Caribbean countries in the World Bank’s Doing
Business Indicators, improvements in several areas are needed, particularly cross-border
trade, property registration, contract enforcement, foreclosure laws, and availability of
credit information (Figure 5). The mission welcomed the authorities’ plan to work closely
with the business sector and donors (particularly the World Bank and USAID) in
pinpointing weaknesses in the investment climate, with a view to submitting reform
proposals to parliament by end-2007.
•

Regional trade in goods and services. In developing its trade policy, St. Lucia has long
been committed to achieving greater competitiveness through effective regional and
global integration. The mission welcomed the authorities’ progress in implementing the
Caribbean Single Market Economy (CSME) requirements and in removing nontariff
barriers. Staff recommended that the authorities enhance regional cooperation in
providing government services and rationalizing tax concessions, and to continue to
support regional efforts to facilitate the movement of goods, labor and capital across
Caribbean countries. In addition, the mission commended the authorities for their
adoption of a National Export Strategy in 2006, which sets out priority areas for the
development of exports of goods and services, including those of tourism and
agribusiness.

•

Labor market reforms. Although unemployment has been falling, it remains high. The
mission recommended that vocational and technical education be strengthened and labor
market flexibility enhanced, including by re-examining regulations for employment
protection and facilitating labor mobility under the OECS Economic Union. Increased
labor mobility is needed to facilitate adjustment to shocks, and the mission urged the
government to continue to push for free labor movement within CARICOM.7

•

Better leveraging benefits from migration. More than a quarter of the labor force of
St. Lucia emigrated to the OECD in the period 1970–2000. This large-scale emigration
has produced a steady flow of remittances from abroad. The mission welcomed the
authorities’ efforts to initiate contact with expatriates and encouraged them to make
greater use of such fora to build networks for trade, investment promotion and tourism in
order to reduce the net costs of emigration. The authorities concurred and intend to
continue to enhance links with the country’s large diaspora.

•

Underdeveloped social safety nets need to be strengthened. The 2006 Poverty Assessment
Report finds that unemployment remains high and poverty has increased in recent years
(Box 3). The focus and coherence of poverty reduction initiatives should be sharpened, to
ensure that scarce resources are directed to the neediest members of society. Poverty

10
reduction objectives should be linked to the social development programs in the budget,
consistent with overall macroeconomic and fiscal objectives.
•

More efficient delivery of health and education services. Poverty is to be tackled through
greater emphasis on health and education, and the authorities intend to gradually move
towards universal health care (UHC) and universal secondary education.8 Regarding
health care, they are concerned about the sustainability of the current financing system,
poor quality and inequity of care, escalating costs, and the rising number of uninsured
(Figure 6). The mission noted the projected health cost pressures, and supported the
authorities’ intention to gradually introduce UHC (Figure 7). Staff recommended that a
range of financing options for UHC be explored (including through a VAT), and urged
that health system developments be carefully analyzed and monitored.
C. Debt Sustainability and Fiscal Policy

19.
A key challenge is to achieve sound public finances and ensure debt
sustainability. Capital spending has been high in recent years, with rising debt service costs
(at end-2007 debt servicing will be about 40 percent of current revenue) which constrain
expenditure on poverty-reduction and social programs. Stronger public finances are needed
to ensure debt sustainability, increase room to maneuver in the event of adverse shocks, and
thereby support the sustainability of the currency board arrangement.
20.
Fiscal imbalances need to be addressed
decisively. The current fiscal trajectory—
declining revenues with limited expenditure
restraint—is worrisome. Measures in the
2007/08 budget (fiscal year April 2007 to
March 2008) will be insufficient to put debt
dynamics on a sustainable path. In particular, the
budgeted doubling of capital spending (to over
20 percent of GDP) would further reverse fiscal
consolidation. Staff estimate that under the
baseline scenario and absent fiscal measures,
public debt would be on a rising path, reaching
close to 90 percent of GDP by 2012 (Annex I).

11
rising share of current revenues, and the debt burden needs to be reduced further. In a
scenario with additional fiscal measures (see below), a moderate increase in grant financing,
and annual GDP growth of about 4¾ percent, staff projections show that debt could fall to
around 60 percent of GDP by 2012, close to the ECCB Monetary Council’s benchmark (see
Annex I). In addition to rising spending, the macroeconomic outlook is subject to
considerable risks, notably natural disasters, a further decline in the terms of trade, rising
interest rates, and a slowdown in the world economy and tourism receipts.
22.
The challenge is to contain the fiscal deficit while allowing for the government’s
goal to raise social spending. The mission recommended a primary deficit (excluding
grants) of around 1¾ percent of GDP over the medium term (see Annex I). This adjustment
requires forging ahead with tax policy and administrative reforms to broaden the tax base and
improve transparency. However, most of the adjustment during the 2007/08 fiscal year would
come from expenditure reductions (about ¾ of 1 percent of GDP), as the scope for immediate
revenue measures is limited. While grants are expected to increase, disbursements are not
expected to reach the level envisaged in the 2007/08 budget.9 To accommodate higher
spending on health and agriculture adjustment, while reducing the deficit, planned current
and capital expenditures will need to be reduced. The mission recommended continued
moderation in the wage bill, and prioritization of capital spending, which should be targeted
at about 8¾ percent of GDP (compared with 21 percent in the budget). The authorities
broadly supported the need for fiscal consolidation and a lower civil service wage bill, and
reiterated that while capital spending would likely be lower than budgeted (due to
implementation constraints), increased capital spending was necessary to attract FDI and
transform the economy away from agriculture toward tourism-based services.

Taxation of petroleum products. Retail
prices of petroleum products are the
lowest in the OECS region. There is a
consumption tax, but in recent years the
government has been absorbing the
additional cost of higher world oil
prices in order to peg the retail price of
fuel, thereby eroding the tax base. To
safeguard revenue, the mission
recommended greater passthrough of

has approved the establishment of a VAT implementation unit, which will commence
work in the coming months. Staff cautioned the authorities to set a realistic date for VAT
implementation, as the experience in other countries has shown that a minimum of 22–24
months is required to adequately prepare and introduce a VAT. The authorities concurred
and are now aiming for implementation by April 2009. In addition, they have already
engaged with CARTAC and the IMF in soliciting the relevant technical assistance.

Property tax. Although the real estate sector is performing well, there is little
improvement in property tax collections. The mission supported the authorities’ plans to
move to a market valuation-based property tax system as soon as technically feasible
(tentatively scheduled for mid-2008), and welcomed the conduct of the required cadastral
surveys as an important first step. In moving to a market valuation-based system, the
authorities should consider reducing the extensive range of exemptions currently
permitted.

Expenditures will need to be contained and debt management enhanced:

•

Public sector wages. The government’s wage bill accounts for about 45 percent of
current expenditures, and has risen in 2006 due to the recently-concluded civil service
salary round. The mission welcomed the authorities’ plans to undertake civil service
reforms, which would offer some scope for savings, while providing greater
differentiation in the pay scale between higher- and lower-skilled workers.

•

Prioritization of capital expenditure. The 2007/08 budget announced a large number of
high-profile projects including a new road network, a tunnel linking the north of the
island to the south, information technology centers, and improvements to airport
terminals. While transportation infrastructure needs to improve, it is critical that the
authorities prioritize and properly phase infrastructure projects. The authorities agreed
with staff’s recommendation that a formal PSIP mechanism for the evaluation of public
investments be introduced to ensure the effectiveness of capital expenditures, and intend
to strengthen technical capacity in the relevant ministries.

•

Debt management. An enhanced debt management unit is a priority institutional
development and could generate important cost savings. It could accurately monitor
existing debt, inform as to the timing of future debt payments, advise on the least-cost
source of managing cash flows, and formulate a strategy for retiring high-cost debt. The
authorities agreed with this proposal, and plan to strengthen technical capacity in the debt
management unit, with IMF technical assistance.

25.
Coverage of the fiscal accounts remains a concern. A complete assessment of
St. Lucia’s public finances has to cover not only the central government but also the broader
public sector. Lack of data on public enterprises permits only a partial analysis of their
activities. The mission recommended that the authorities prepare consolidated accounts and
foster expenditure control at all levels of the broader public sector budget.
D. Reducing Vulnerabilities
26.
The medium-term outlook appears favorable, but is subject to risks because of
the economy’s high vulnerability to exogenous shocks. These include:

•

Financial sector soundness. Financial sector risks—to both banks and nonbanks—need
to be monitored more carefully. Like most countries in the region, bank credit to the
private sector increased sharply in 2006 and the first half of 2007. While nonperforming
loans have declined and provisioning has been stable, the ongoing credit boom has the
potential to erode the quality of banking system assets. Furthermore, commercial banks’
net foreign assets have declined, signaling an increase in balance sheet vulnerabilities. In
addition, there has been a rapid expansion in the activities of the nonbank financial
sector—particularly insurance companies—and the potential risks from these activities
need to be closely monitored.

•

Financial sector supervision. The mission commends the authorities for bolstering
supervision of banks, nonbanks, and international financial services through the
strengthening of the Financial Services Supervision Unit (FSSU), the passing of
amendments to the Money Laundering Prevention Act and uniform Banking Act in 2006,
and the likely end-2007 passage of the Cooperatives Society Act, uniform Money
Services Act, and uniform Insurance Act. The mission also reiterated the need for more
on-site examinations of St. Lucian banks by the ECCB. Additional measures need to be
taken to strengthen the effectiveness of financial sector supervision, including through the
development of a broad supervisory framework to regulate all nonbank financial
intermediaries. In 2006 an independent Single Regulatory Unit (SRU) for nonbanks was
approved by Cabinet, but has yet to be implemented. The SRU should be established as
soon as possible, by granting full autonomy to the FSSU as a statutory body to regulate
credit unions, domestic insurance, and international financial services.

15
•

Oil prices. The potential for an increase in world oil prices is a major risk to St. Lucia as
an oil-import-dependent economy. In this connection, the mission noted that the
authorities had renegotiated a contract with the privately-owned oil trans-shipment
company HESS, which includes an option to construct an oil refinery in St. Lucia. The
authorities have not signed the PetroCaribe Agreement with Venezuela, and have no
immediate intentions to do so.

supports the authorities’ efforts to bolster social safety nets for displaced farmers and
agricultural workers, and recommends focusing on time-bound measures such as income
transfers, retraining programs, noncontributory pensions, and limited subsidies on
agricultural inputs (to encourage diversification into nonbanana agriculture). Technical
assistance from the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department (planned for the third quarter of
2007) will build upon the 2006 Poverty Assessment Report in reviewing the impact of
trade preference erosion on poverty.

•

International financial turbulence. In the past, international financial crises have had
little impact on ECCU domestic credit markets, given their weak links with financial
markets outside the Caribbean. Although the ECCU is progressively integrating with
world capital markets, St. Lucia’s vulnerability from that source still appears fairly
limited. However, should ongoing financial turbulence reduce economic growth and
consumption in North America and Europe, there would be strong implications for St.
Lucia in a potential decline in stay-over tourist arrivals and FDI.
E. Other Issues

27.
Despite efforts to enhance databases, St. Lucia’s statistical data remains weak in
terms of coverage and timeliness. Improvements in all areas are needed to facilitate
effective policymaking, surveillance, and informed public debate. In particular, more

resources should be devoted to strengthen data in the areas of national accounts, private
sector external debt, tourism, labor markets, public enterprises, and foreign project aid.
28.
The decline in donor assistance has
complicated the transition out of
agriculture. The authorities generally agreed
with the mission’s recommendations on
easing the transition of the economy from
agriculture to tourism, but lamented the lack
of donor support. The authorities stated that
donor financing for investment in health,
education and social spending had fallen
sharply, just at the time it was most needed.

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
The economy of St. Lucia showed continuing strength in 2006, although nearterm prospects are for a slowdown. Activity was driven by expansion in construction and
tourism-related services, and by robust growth in financial services. Growth is likely to
decelerate in 2007, due in large part to a weakening in agricultural exports, tourism-related
services, and construction activity.
30.
Fiscal prospects are worrisome. In recent years capital spending has risen strongly,
and the debt stock is placing a growing burden on the economy. Under current policies, debt
servicing will absorb about 40 percent of current revenues in 2007, and public debt would
rise to about 90 percent of GDP by 2012. Fiscal consolidation is needed to enhance debt
sustainability, place the debt ratio on a downward path while allowing for increased
expenditure on poverty-reduction and social programs, and provide room for maneuver in
case of shocks. A package of measures, including holding constant the real wage bill and
lowering capital expenditure should narrow the primary deficit (excluding grants) of central
government by around ¾ of 1 percent of GDP in FY 2007.
31.
Over the medium term, implementation of planned tax reforms will be
important to achieve fiscal sustainability. Staff welcomed the authorities’ plans to broaden
the tax base, including the introduction of a more flexible fuel pricing mechanism, marketbased valuation of property taxes, and a VAT. While these measures will support the needed
fiscal adjustment, it is also important that the authorities reduce the overall level of tax
concessions, in order to maintain revenue buoyancy. These measures, together with
additional grant financing and medium-term GDP growth of about 4¾ percent per year,
could bring the debt ratio down to near 60 percent of GDP by 2012.

17
32.
The authorities’ plans to accelerate tourism-related public investment carry
significant risks. Given the amount of resources involved, it is critical that the authorities
seek grants and highly concessional financing, conduct appropriate feasibility studies, and
prioritize capital spending. In this context, the authorities are encouraged to seek technical
assistance from CDB and CARTAC in establishing a formal PSIP mechanism, and
strengthen technical capacity in the debt management unit.
33.
While the real exchange rate does not seem out of line with fundamentals,
competitiveness is a challenge and structural reforms need to be accelerated to raise the
economy’s growth potential. Priority should be given to measures that secure long-term
fiscal savings, enhance labor market flexibility, and reduce the cost of capital. Successful
implementation of such reforms would raise growth potential and provide continuing support
to the currency board arrangement. Given the strong interest of external investors in
St. Lucia, this is a propitious time to push forward with reforms to enhance the investment
climate, review the regime of tax incentives, and strengthen regional integration efforts.
34.
Strengthening the supervision of the financial sector is another priority. Given
the rapid growth in private sector credit and growing net foreign liabilities of commercial
banks, credit quality and risk management in banks warrant close monitoring. Staff
welcomes the authorities’ plans to consolidate regulation and supervision of nonbank
financial intermediaries, and continuing efforts to enhance supervision of international
financial services.
35.
The ongoing erosion of trade preferences for bananas is having important
economic and social consequences. Staff supports the authorities’ plans to provide welltargeted safety nets for displaced farmers and agricultural workers, through temporary
measures such as income transfers and retraining programs. More effective use of planned
EU assistance to ease the transition of the economy away from agriculture is critical in
support of those efforts.
36.
St. Lucia is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. In recent years,
the authorities have made strong efforts to bolster national disaster mitigation and
preparedness, including through participation in the World Bank’s Catastrophic Risk
Insurance Facility. Staff encourages the authorities to further reduce disaster risks,
particularly through insurance of public buildings and infrastructure, better enforcement of
building codes, and enhanced disaster management.
37.
Even in the best of circumstances, the economic and fiscal situation of St. Lucia
remains vulnerable. The debt burden is expected to remain high for several years, rendering
the country vulnerable to adverse shocks. Other risks include shocks to tourism demand, a
tightening of conditions in regional and international credit markets, natural disasters, and
international oil prices. The authorities need to carefully manage these risks, and respond
rapidly to any changes in the country’s economic environment.

18
38.
Economic and social statistics need to be improved. Staff shares the authorities’
concern that data deficiencies compromise the quality of policy analysis and design, and
encourages the authorities to strengthen data quality and provision, with technical assistance
from CARTAC and the Fund.
39.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Tourism receipts plummeted in 2006
due to a decline in both stay-over

expenditure. A variety of factors
contributed, including a change in U.S.
passport requirements, poor marketing
in North America, and inadequate
airlift. In addition, hotels and other
service providers reacted to the drop in
tourist arrivals by reducing prices,
which lowered average visitor
expenditure by about 6 percent.

The current account deficit is expected to shrink in 2007, and will continue to be largely
financed by foreign direct investment flows. While agricultural exports will be adversely
affected by Hurricane Dean, imports as a share of GDP are expected to fall to pre-2006 levels
as three major hotel projects are completed. Tourism receipts are expected to recover modestly,
as a result of an aggressive marketing campaign underway in the U.S., and new direct flights
from New York, Barbados and Manchester.

Box 2. St. Lucia: Real Exchange Rate and External Balance
St. Lucia’s real exchange rate was assessed using the Fundamental Equilibrium Real
Exchange Rate (FEER) approach.1 Panel regression techniques were used to estimate
an equilibrium relationship between the real effective exchange rate and a set of
fundamentals which include: productivity differentials (proxied by per capita tourist
arrivals relative to those in The Bahamas); the tourism terms of trade (proxied by
movements in overall terms of trade that are not explained by the terms of trade of
goods); government consumption spending; and net foreign assets.2
The results for St. Lucia show that the real effective exchange rate is broadly in line
with fundamentals. Both the actual and equilibrium real effective exchange rates have
fallen since the beginning of the decade—the former due to the EC dollar’s peg to the
depreciating U.S. dollar, and the latter because of a parallel decline in the terms of trade,
and, since 2003, relative tourist arrivals (see paragraph 10).

Box 3. St. Lucia: Poverty Reduction Strategy
Poverty rates in St. Lucia have increased in the
last decade, despite a significant drop in the
indigent population. According to the 2006
Assessment of Poverty in St. Lucia, commissioned
by the CDB, 29 percent of the St. Lucian population
was poor, of which 1.6 percent indigent, in 2005/06.
Using an estimate of 33 percent above the poverty
line as the criterion for vulnerability, the report
deemed 47 percent of the population to be
vulnerable. The study also finds that poverty is
primarily a rural phenomenon (driven by the decline
in the banana sector), with a high concentration in
younger ages.

St. Lucia established a Poverty Reduction Fund (PRF) in 1998, with initial financing from the
World Bank. The PRF was set up by the government in the wake of a 1995 Cargill Report which
stressed the negative social impact of the restructuring of the banana industry. The thrust of PRF is to
reduce poverty by building capacity in poor areas. St. Lucia is also the beneficiary of over
EC$12 million under the CDB’s Basic Needs Trust Fund (BNTF) for the period 2003–10. The St. Lucia
Poverty Action Plan (PAP), which was a prerequisite for the disbursement of the CDB grant, highlights
water for all (already achieved); physical access to communities through roads; targeting of the indigent;
skill training and improvement of the employability of the young.
The PAP follows a multifaceted approach. Current measures consist of (i) job training programs for
the unemployed (including the National Skills Development Center, funded primarily by the EU and
other development stakeholders); (ii) infrastructure projects in poor communities (including funding by
the World Bank and the CDB); (iii) a public assistance benefit for the vulnerable (through the Ministry
of Social Transformation); and (iv) the promotion of a micro-enterprise sector (through the Ministry of
Labour). Given the high unemployment rate and low labor participation rates, the authorities are also
undertaking new poverty-alleviating measures, including (i) the move to universal secondary education;
(ii) introduction of universal health care; and (iii) the introduction of an IDA-financed Skill
Enhancement Project.
The main component of the country’s existing social safety net is the public assistance program.
This program currently assists some 3,900 persons, primarily older people, with a monthly stipend of
EC$85, which is well below the indigence line of EC$131.
The World Bank’s 2006 Public Expenditure Review recommends the development of a wellcoordinated social protection strategy and more transparent targeting of social programs. The
government currently implements approximately 20 social programs, through at least six different
ministries and statutory bodies. However, social programs targeted to the poor are largely overlapping
and administratively cumbersome, and are consequently not well poised to respond to chronic poverty.
The Ministry of Social Transformation is currently examining ways to enhance coordination and
targeting.
There are no social safety nets for aging banana farmers. A 1995 Cargill Report estimated that up to
10,000 persons could be displaced by a restructuring in the banana sector. Despite a recommendation by
a 2001 Banana Industry Strategy Taskforce Report that pension services be provided to aging banana
farmers, little progress has been made.

Annex I. St. Lucia: Medium-Term Outlook Under Alternative Fiscal Scenarios
The risk of current fiscal policies leading to an unsustainable level of public debt has
risen, given the increasing pressure for capital and social spending. In the absence of
containment of expenditures, notably in capital spending, and a determined increase in
revenues, current debt dynamics are unfavorable.
Two fiscal scenarios are considered—a baseline and an alternative scenario. Under the
baseline scenario, the debt stock and debt servicing costs continue to rise; under the
alternative scenario, the stock of debt declines gradually over the medium term.
Baseline scenario. The authorities continue current policies with large overall imbalances
that are financed commercially, and also through some grants from Taiwan Province of
China. Financing is assumed to continue to be available. In the medium term, growth remains
driven by the public sector, mainly through large-scale construction, but is still lower (by
about ½ of 1 percent) than under the alternative scenario. On the revenue side, new measures
would be limited to the introduction of a revenue-neutral VAT and some reform of property
taxes, but additional grants would be expected. On the expenditure side, the wage bill would
remain constant (as a share of GDP), and there would be an increase in capital expenditures.
Under this scenario, the central government primary deficit (excluding grants) would
deteriorate rapidly reaching about 8 percent of GDP by 2012, and public debt would reach
close to 90 percent of GDP by 2012 (Table 6, Baseline Scenario).
Alternative scenario. A fiscal adjustment of 0.7 percent of GDP is assumed for FY 2007
(see main text) and further adjustments are envisaged over the medium term. The adjustment
in FY 2007 is expected to be realized mainly through prioritization of capital expenditure.
Over the medium term, greater revenue mobilization (about 2½ percent of GDP)—which
restores the revenue effort to levels attained in the last decade—would focus on: (i) increased
petroleum product taxes (through more flexible adjustment of domestic retail prices starting
in 2008); (ii) more vigorous collection of domestic taxes (personal income tax, corporate
profit tax, and consumption taxes); (iii) the introduction of market valuation-based property
taxes in 2008; and (iv) the introduction of a revenue-positive VAT in 2009. Additional grants
are expected from Taiwan Province of China and the European Union. On the expenditure
side, in order to create room for planned additional social spending, growth in the real wage
bill would be minimal (by holding constant the number of civil servants), while capital
expenditure would be curtailed by the elimination or postponement of low-priority projects.
With the impetus from (above average) spending on public sector projects, underlying
growth is expected to accelerate with the greater activity in the private sector, and is
estimated at about 4¾ percent over the medium term. Under this scenario, the central
government primary deficit (excluding grants) would fall from 2.7 percent to 1.8 percent of
GDP by 2012, and public debt would decline to about 60 percent of GDP by 2012 (Table 6,
Alternative Scenario, and Table 7).

30
Annex II. Summary of Appendices
Fund Relations
St. Lucia does not have outstanding obligations to the Fund. St. Lucia is a member of the Eastern
Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), which manages monetary policy and the exchange system for its
eight members. The common currency, the Eastern Caribbean dollar, has been pegged to the U.S.
dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar since July 1976. St. Lucia has accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the
making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. The last Article IV
consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on December 21, 2005 (IMF Country
Report No. 06/325). CARTAC has provided extensive technical assistance in recent years. In
addition, FAD plans to field a revenue administration mission (to propose reforms to tax and customs
administration) in September 2007.
Relations with the World Bank Group11
In September 2005, the Eastern Caribbean Sub-Region Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for
FY 2006–09 was presented to the Board of the World Bank. The strategy supports the sub-region’s
development agenda through two main pillars: (1) stimulating growth and improving
competitiveness; and (2) reducing vulnerability, by promoting greater social inclusion and
strengthening disaster risk management. There are five active World Bank projects in St. Lucia for a
net commitment of approximately US$24.5 million: Telecommunications and ICT Development,
Water Supply Infrastructure Improvement, HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, the Caribbean
Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility, and the OECS Skills for Inclusive Growth.
Relations with the Caribbean Development Bank12
St. Lucia has continued to receive financing from the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) for
infrastructure development, human resource development, the formulation and implementation of
economic, social and sectoral policies, direct and indirect lending to the productive sectors,
environmental protection and poverty reduction. At end-2006, St. Lucia had a total outstanding
balance of US$148.7 million. Since 1970, CDB financing for St. Lucia has been distributed mainly in
the transportation and communication, education, and manufacturing sectors.
Statistical Issues
St. Lucia participates in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). Although the
statistical database compares well with those of its ECCU peers, there are persistent weaknesses in
coverage, frequency, quality, and timeliness, in particular: incorporation of tourism in the national
accounts, the public sector beyond the central government, and the balance of payments.

INTERNATIONAL MONTETARY FUND
ST. LUCIA
External and Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the staff of the International Monetary Fund
In consultation with World Bank Staff
September 7, 2007
This debt sustainability analysis (DSA) assesses the sustainability of St. Lucia’s public and external
debt. The analysis suggests that a key challenge will be achieving sound public finances to ensure
debt sustainability. Staff estimates show that absent fiscal consolidation that would return the
primary balance to its historical average, public debt would be on a rising and unsustainable path.
This analysis also concludes that St. Lucia’s risk of external debt distress is high.
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Macroeconomic outcomes have strengthened significantly in recent years, while fiscal
imbalances have remained sizeable. Real GDP growth averaged 3¾ percent during 2003–05, and
reached about 5 percent in 2006. Activity was sustained by construction and government services,
both related to tourism and preparations for the Cricket World Cup (CWC). Fiscal imbalances
remained high in 2006. Total tax revenues were strong, buoyed by reforms at customs. However,
petroleum tax collection was poor (given the limited pass-through of world oil prices). Significant
increases occurred in capital expenditures and wages and salaries. As a result, the overall deficit fell
only slightly to 6½ percent of GDP in 2006, and gross public debt increased to 67 percent of GDP.
II. UNDERLYING DSA ASSUMPTIONS
2.
The baseline scenario assumes authorities continue current policies with large overall
imbalances that are financed commercially. In the medium term, growth is projected around
4¼ percent, driven mostly by public sector capital expenditure and some expansion of the tourism
capacity. Under this scenario, the central government primary deficit (excluding grants) deteriorates
rapidly peaking at around 6½ percent of GDP by 2012. While these main parameters imply a rate of
growth higher than the staff projections and assumptions in the 2005 Article IV consultation DSA,
they are consistent with the stronger growth observed in the period 2003–06, and with the projected
expansion of tourism capacity.

41

Box 1. Baseline Macroeconomic Assumptions (2007–27)
•

Real GDP growth is projected to average about 4¼ percent. While this assumption
implies a rate of growth higher than the average observed in the 1990s (3 percent), it
is consistent with the stronger growth observed in the period 2003–06, and with the
projected expansion of public sector construction and tourism accommodation
capacity. Inflation is projected to remain low, consistent with historical averages and
the currency board arrangement.

•

The primary balance of the central government (including grants) is projected to
deteriorate rapidly peaking around 6½ percent of GDP by 2012. On the revenue side,
new measures would be limited to the introduction of a revenue-neutral VAT, and
some reform of property taxes. On the expenditure side, the wage bill would remain
constant (as a share of GDP), and capital expenditure increases to 12 percent of GDP
by 2012.

•

Annual disbursements of external capital grants reach 4 percent of GDP in 2007 as
grants from the European Union are expected to increase. In the medium term, grants
are expected to be around 1½ percent of GDP, consistent with historical averages.

•

The current account deficit is assumed to return gradually to a more sustainable level
following its sharp increase in 2006, due to a slowdown in tourism-related imports
and a pickup in tourist receipts. The expansion of tourist arrivals is underpinned by an
expansion of the hotel capacity of 40 percent over the medium-term.

•

FDI is assumed to remain around its historical average of 11 percent of GDP.
III. EVALUATION OF PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

3.
At end-2006 public debt stood at about 67 percent of GDP—nearly twice the level of a
decade ago—albeit still the lowest in the ECCU. Expansionary budgets in 2000–02 sharply raised the
fiscal deficit and debt-to-GDP ratio. In subsequent years the authorities strengthened fiscal
management by tightening revenue administration and containing capital expenditure. Fiscal
imbalances remained high in FY 2006/07, owing to increased CWC-related capital expenditures.
4.
External debt represents 44 percent of GDP, while domestic debt represents 23 percent of
GDP. Regarding the stock of external debt, the largest share is owed to multilateral and bilateral
creditors (around 27 percent of GDP, with the Caribbean Development Bank holding around three
fifths of that share), followed by commercial creditors (around 12 percent of GDP). In the future,
most of new external requirements are expected to be financed through the ECCU Regional

42

Securities Markets (RGSM). On the domestic front, commercial banks are the most important lenders
to the government.
Baseline scenario
5.
Under the baseline scenario St. Lucia would reach a public debt to GDP ratio of about
91 percent by 2012. The debt-to-GDP ratio would increase further to around 116 percent of GDP by
2017. All other indicators of debt sustainability show a sharp deterioration, particularly with the NPV
of debt-to revenue ratio increasing from 235 percent in 2007 to around 331 percent by 2012.
Alternative scenarios
Adjustment scenario
6.
Under this scenario a fiscal adjustment would reduce the primary deficit of the central
government to ½ of 1 percent over the medium term. This adjustment would restore the primary
deficit to its average level over the last decade, and would require the introduction of a revenuepositive VAT, introduction of a market valuation-based property tax and prioritization of capital
expenditure.
7.
Under this adjustment scenario St. Lucia would reach a public debt to GDP ratio of about
60 percent—the benchmark of the ECCB—by 2012. The debt to GDP ratio would decline further to
around 53 percent of GDP by 2027. All other indicators of debt sustainability would show a constant
improvement, particularly with debt service as a share of current revenue falling from around
40 percent in 2006 to around 25 percent by 2012.
Changes in growth and primary balance
8.
The sensitivity analysis shows that economic growth and the primary balance are the two key
drivers of St. Lucia’s debt dynamics. If no fiscal adjustment is implemented and the primary deficit
were to be kept at its 2006 level (3 percent of GDP), the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio would reach
128 percent of GDP by 2027 (Table 2, Scenario A2). Similarly if growth is assumed to remain at one
standard deviation below the baseline, the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio reaches 198 percent of GDP by
2027 (Table 2, Scenario A3).
9.
The sensitivity analysis also shows the importance of containing expenditure if economic
growth were to decline. In Alternative Scenario B1, in which growth declines to -0.6 percent for
2008 and 2009, the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio increases rapidly reaching 199 percent of GDP by
2027. This is because as output slows, fiscal revenues are assumed to remain constant as a share of
GDP while expenditures are assumed to remain constant in nominal terms relative to the baseline
scenario, producing a substantial and permanent deterioration of the primary balance. This, in turn
increases debt ratios markedly.

43

Natural disaster
10.
The impact of a natural disaster on St. Lucia’s debt dynamics was also analyzed (Table 2,
Alternative Scenario A4). Under this scenario it is assumed that a hurricane increases the primary
deficit of the government by 3 percent of GDP in 2008, 2009 and 2010, reverting to its baseline
levels thereafter.1 This shock accelerates the deterioration of the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio reaching
108 percent of GDP by 2012.
IV. EVALUATION OF EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
11.
St. Lucia’s external debt sustainability analysis includes only public sector debt, since data on
private sector external borrowing is not available. As a result, the external DSA follows a similar
pattern to that of the public sector DSA.
12.
Under the baseline scenario the NPV of external debt shows a clear increasing path reaching
84 percent of GDP by 2017, and exceeding the prudential threshold of 50 percent by 2008. 2 The
NPV of debt to exports ratio increases rapidly exceeding the indicative threshold of 200 percent by
2020.
13.
Sensitivity analysis shows that the level of external debt is most responsive to a negative
shock on output growth and costlier terms of financing. If the current account deficit, FDI and GDP
growth are assumed at their historical averages, the external debt-to-GDP ratio increases to 100
percent by 2017 (Table 4, Scenario A1). This is driven by the lower output growth, since the current
account deficit and FDI evolve in a manner similar to that in the baseline scenario. Similarly, if GDP
growth were to fall permanently to one standard deviation below the historical average, the external
debt-to-GDP ratio would increase to 98 percent by 2017 (Table 4, Scenario B1). If the interest rate on
new borrowing was 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline, the external debt-to-GDP ratio
would increase to 99 percent by 2017 (Table 4, Scenario A2).
V. CONCLUSION
14.
Absent a fiscal adjustment that would return the primary balance to its historical average,
imbalances for the overall public sector would be on an increasing and unsustainable path exceeding
a NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio of 100 percent by 2014. Staff analysis show that with a fiscal adjustment
1

The actual impact of this shock could be lower given the recent participation of St. Lucia in the Caribbean Catastrophe
Insurance Facility—a regional insurance pool organized by the World Bank.

The DSA uses policy-dependent external debt-burden indicators. Policy performance is measured by the Country Policy
and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index, compiled annually by the World Bank. The CPIA divides countries into three
performance categories (strong, medium, and poor) based on the overall quality of its macroeconomic policies, with
strong performers having higher prudential thresholds than poor performers. St. Lucia is classified by the CPIA as a
strong performer, with prudential thresholds on NPV of debt-to-GDP and debt-to-exports ratios of 50 and 200 percent,
respectively.

that would bring the primary deficit (including grants) to around ½ of 1 percent of GDP over the
medium term (close to the long-term average), St. Lucia would reach a sustainable public debt-toGDP ratio of about 60 percent—the benchmark of the ECCB—by 2012.
15.
On the external front St. Lucia faces a high risk of debt distress. The baseline scenario
indicates a breach of the NPV of debt-to-GDP threshold by 2008, while different stress tests
underlined St. Lucia’s vulnerabilities to natural disasters, costlier terms of financing, and lower
output growth.

Average

Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Nonfinancial public sector gross debt.
Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the NPV of new debt).

3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the
shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.

VII. Exchange Rate Arrangement: St. Lucia is a member of the Eastern Caribbean Currency
Union which has a common central bank (the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank) and currency (the
Eastern Caribbean dollar). Since July 1976 the Eastern Caribbean dollar has been pegged to the
U.S. dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar. St. Lucia has accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. St. Lucia maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on
payments and transfers for current international transactions.
VIII. Last Article IV Consultation: St. Lucia is currently on the 12-month cycle. The last
Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on December 21, 2005. The
relevant documents are IMF Country Report No. 06/325 and IMF Country Report No. 06/326.
IX. Technical Assistance (January 2006–August 2007): Several missions from the Caribbean
Regional Technical Assistance Center (CARTAC) have visited St. Lucia since the beginning of
2006. In the area of public finance, CARTAC consultants assisted the authorities in financial
programming, accessing the impact of a pass-through of the international price of fuel, the
introduction of a VAT and a market-based property tax, and with other measures aimed at
containing expenditures. In addition, CARTAC consultants helped develop a proposal for the
establishment of an Internal Audit Unit in the Accountant General’s Department, and completed
a diagnosis of budget development reform needs, including the introduction of multiyear and
output budgeting. CARTAC has also provided technical assistance in statistics. The St. Lucia
Statistics Department had done some work independently, but CARTAC provided assistance in
resolving problems of classification, obtaining more accurate data on international trade, refining
the household budget survey, and in compiling the national accounts.

53

Appendix II. St. Lucia: Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of July 30, 2007)
The World Bank’s management presented to its Board the Eastern Caribbean Sub-Region
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), on September 13, 2005. The World Bank Group’s
strategy for the four years covered by this CAS (FY06–09) supports the sub-region’s
development agenda through two main pillars: (i) stimulating growth and improving
competitiveness; and (ii) reducing vulnerability, by promoting greater social inclusion and
strengthening disaster risk management. Recognizing the OECS countries’ weakened
creditworthiness due to high debt ratios, Bank activities will focus on leveraging available
donor grant financing. Following the recommendations of the recently completed growth and
competitiveness study for the OECS, IBRD and IDA support would focus on providing
technical and financial assistance for interventions to support the two main pillars. An
indicative Base Case lending scenario consists of about US$51.3 million in IDA resources
for the four OECS blend countries (Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the
Grenadines). This envelope includes the estimated IDA country allocations for each of the
four countries during FY06–09, and an IDA Regional allocation of US$15.2 million for two
regional projects: US$12 million for Catastrophe Risk Insurance and US$3.2 million for
Infrastructure and Utilities Reform.
I. PROJECTS
There are five active World Bank projects in St. Lucia for a net commitment of
approximately US$24.5 million.
The St. Lucia Water Supply Infrastructure Improvement Project was approved in
May 2005 for US$7.7 million. The objectives of the St. Lucia Water Supply Infrastructure
Improvement Project are: (i) to alleviate the water shortage in the entire north of the country;
(ii) to implement urgent investments that will result in additional revenues, and reduction of
the likelihood of commercial users abandoning the system; and (iii) to improve the potential
of a successful partnership between the government and the private sector. On April 10 2007,
a request for an additional US$1.84 million was approved for this project.
The HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project approved in July 2004 for US$6.4 million
will support the national program, which aims to prevent and control the spread of the
epidemic, and to mitigate the socio-economic impact of the disease on the population. The
project will use a two-pronged strategy: targeting interventions at high risk groups, and
implementing non-targeted activities for the general population. The first component—
Community and Civil Society Initiatives—will finance HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and
support activities of Civil Society Organizations, women's organizations, professional
organizations, trade unions, and private sector organizations. The second component will
support the response to HIV/AIDS by non-health sector line ministries, namely, basic cross-

54
cutting HIV/AIDS activities which all ministries are expected to implement under their
respective sectoral HIV/AIDS programs. The third component will strengthen the capacity of
the Ministry of Health to provide technical guidance for the national response to HIV/AIDS,
specifically it will strengthen HIV/AIDS related services for prevention, treatment, and care
delivered through the health care system. Finally, the fourth component will help build the
institutional capacity for scaling up responsiveness, by financing technical advisory services,
training, staffing, equipment, goods, and general operating costs.
The Telecommunications and ICT Development Project approved in May 2005 for
US$543,000, aims at improving the access, quality, and use of telecommunications and ICT
services to achieve socio-economic development in the Organization of Eastern Caribbean
States (OECS). The project has four components: (i) strengthening the national and regional
regulatory frameworks and promoting additional competition in the telecommunications
sector—emphasis will be given to capacity building of Eastern Caribbean
Telecommunications Authority (ECTEL) and the National Telecommunications Regulatory
Commissions (NTRCs) by providing them with assistances to revise the regional and
national sector legislation, and develop a modem interconnection regime; (ii) reviewing
current universal access policy, creating related guidelines, and providing financial support to
establish a Universal Service Fund (USF); (iii) improving growth and competitiveness in
ICT-enabled services through utilization of broadband infrastructure; and (iv) ensuring
management and administration of the overall project.
The Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) was approved in
January 2007. This is the world’s first-ever multi-country catastrophe insurance pool. The
bank approved a US$4.5 million IDA credit for St. Lucia to finance their contribution to the
fund over three years. The Facility will enable governments to purchase catastrophe
insurance coverage against adverse natural events, such as a major earthquakes or hurricanes.
The CCRIF allows participating countries to pool their country-specific risks into one, betterdiversified portfolio, resulting in a substantial reduction in the premium cost of
45−50 percent.
The OECS (LC) Skills for Inclusive Growth project was approved in May 2007 for
US$3.5 million and will become effective on September 2007. The objective of the project is
to assist the Government of St. Lucia to increase the employability of youth through privatesector driven training. This objective will be pursued through three means: (i) establishment
of a competitive training scheme that finances private sector-driven training and traineeships,
(ii) development of an improved policy framework for delivering training by enhancing
OECS collaboration in training and introducing occupational standards to increase quality
and value of training; and (iii) strengthening institutional capacity to better implement,
monitor, and plan training.

55
II. ECONOMIC AND SECTOR WORK
The Bank has completed a series of analytical work relating to: public sector capacity in the
OECS including the Institutional and Organizational Capacity Review, the OECS
Procurement Assessment Review, and the OECS Financial Accountability Assessment. In
conjunction with the IMF, a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) was completed in
early 2004, and a fiscal issues report, which includes a review of public expenditures in
St. Lucia, was completed in 2005. The Bank also recently completed an OECS study on
Growth and Competitiveness, a Caribbean Air Transport Rationalization report, and a
Caribbean Crime and Violence study. Work is ongoing on an OECS Private Sector Financing
Study.

Appendix III. St. Lucia: Relations with the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB)
(As of June 30, 2007)

CDB interventions in St. Lucia have facilitated sustainable development by supporting
investments in both social and economic infrastructure. This support has been financial and
non-financial in nature and was aimed at ensuring that St. Lucia remains competitive in the
global economy while ensuring that the needs of vulnerable groups are addressed.
Specifically, the CDB has been involved in areas such as infrastructural development, human
resource development, the formulation and implementation of economic, social and sectoral
policies, direct and indirect lending to the productive sectors, environmental protection and
poverty reduction. Going forward, it is expected that the Bank will continue to support
sustainable economic growth by facilitating upgrades to utilities and infrastructure,
improving the competitiveness of the tourism sector, supporting medium and small
enterprises and reducing vulnerability to natural hazards. Other areas in which CDB is
anticipated to be involved include (i) fostering inclusive social development through
enhanced health care, education and housing, and (ii) promoting good governance by
encouraging pro-poor governance, fostering the social partnership and supporting initiatives
to improve development planning and macro-economic management.
St. Lucia is the second-largest beneficiary of CDB funding, with US$265.7 million being
approved to St. Lucia cumulatively in loans, contingent loans, equity and grants from 1970 to
June 2007. Of this amount US$136.9 million as approved from Ordinary Capital Resources
with the remainder being sourced from the “soft” window. New loans and grants approved in
2006 totalled to US$0.032 million, however, loan and grant cancellations saw a net negative
net position of US$906,000 being recorded. At the end of December 2006, St. Lucia had a
total outstanding balance of US$148.7 million compared to US$138.1 million at the end of
the previous year. No new loans or grants were approved for January to June 2007.
Disbursements of loans, contingent loans, equity and grants during 2006 amounted to
US$17.6 million compared to US$19.4 million disbursed in 2005. Disbursements during the
first six months of 2007 amounted to US$2.5 million. Repayment of loans during 2006
amounted to US$8.1 million compared with US$3.8 million repaid in 2005. Approximately
US$4.8 million was repaid during the first six months of 2006. Below is a summary of the
cumulative sectoral distribution of CDB approved assistance to St. Lucia.

Appendix IV. St. Lucia: Statistical Issues
(As of August 23, 2007)
Data provision is inadequate for surveillance purposes. Although the statistical database
compares well with those of its ECCU peers, the accuracy and timeliness of macroeconomic
statistics should be further improved in order to achieve adequate standards for Fund
surveillance and meet the authorities’ needs. There are persistent weaknesses in coverage,
frequency, quality, and timeliness, in particular regarding the national accounts, the public
sector beyond the central government, and the balance of payments. Also, comprehensive
and regular labor statistics are not available. The Ministry of Economic Affairs publishes biannually an economic and social review, which includes statistics covering developments in
many macroeconomic sectors. The Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) publishes a
quarterly economic and financial review and an annual balance of payments for each member
country.
St. Lucia is a participant in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). Its metadata,
which include detailed plans for statistical development in the main macroeconomic areas
over the short and medium term, have been posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards
Bulletin Board (http://dsbb.imf.org) since September 21, 2000.
Real Sector
The authorities are developing new GDP estimates aimed mainly at obtaining better sectoral
estimates, but the process is being delayed by data collection problems. Attempts are being
made to compile quarterly GDP estimates with funding from the Organization of American
States (OAS). Given the increasing importance of tourism activities, a new comprehensive
survey of the sector is necessary to establish key data, such as average length of stay in
different types of accommodations and average daily expenditure by type of tourist arrival.
This information should then be cross-checked with other related activities (i.e., restaurants
and transportation) to ensure consistency. A mission fielded by the Caribbean Regional
Technical Assistance Center (CARTAC) in 2005 helped the authorities develop export and
import price indices and undertook initial work on measuring price developments in the
tourism sector. A survey to establish the consumer basket for a new CPI has been much
delayed, and work should be accelerated to replace the 1984 index. Another area in need of
improvement is labor statistics, in particular, the reporting of private and public employment
and wages.
Public Sector Finance
Reporting of central government data has improved substantially over the last few years, but
deficiencies remain in the rest of the public sector. The authorities are reporting monthly data
on the central government’s current revenue and expenditure, using a Fund-compatible
economic classification, with lags of a couple of months. However, frequent and substantial
revisions suggest that there is a need for further refinement. With regard to the rest of the

58
public sector, the periodicity and timeliness of data reporting should be improved; annual
financial statements and projections are currently obtained directly from the entities during
Fund missions and partially consolidated public sector accounts are compiled by the Fund
staff. Data on domestic debt of the public sector are not available on a regular basis. No fiscal
data are reported to STA for publication in the GFS Yearbook or in IFS.
Money and Banking
The ECCB compiles monetary data on a monthly basis with a lag of about six weeks. The
information is reported on a regular basis based on a standardized report form since July
2006. The institutional coverage of the other depository corporations is incomplete, given
that data of mortgage companies, finance companies, building societies, and credit unions—
all of which accept deposits—are excluded. In this respect, close coordination between the
ECCB and the regulatory authority (which supervises financial corporations other than those
licensed under the Banking Act) is crucial. Moreover, sectoral and instrument classification
of the monetary statistics are not in full compliance with the methodology of the Monetary
and Financial Statistics Manual.
Balance of Payments
Balance of payments data are compiled by the ECCB on an annual basis. Although recent
data provide a more detailed breakdown of goods than in the past, in other areas they do not
provide sufficient detail to enable publication of the full classification used in the fifth edition
of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). Annual data up to 2005 are published in the
IFS. In general, enhanced data resources and better compilation procedures are needed to
improve the accuracy and timeliness of balance of payments statistics. Efforts should also be
made to compile quarterly balance of payments statistics.
External Debt
The Ministry of Finance has a comprehensive database for public and publicly guaranteed
external loans that provides detailed and reasonably up-to-date breakdowns of disbursements
and debt service. Information on bonds placed abroad is compiled annually and monthly data
are provided only at the staff’s request. There is a need to restore the quality of information
on these bonds, which has weakened recently as the distinction between resident and
nonresident holders was discontinued.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 4, 2008

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
St. Lucia
On September 26, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with St. Lucia.1
Background
Macroeconomic outcomes have strengthened significantly in recent years. Real GDP growth
averaged 3¾ percent during 2003–05, and reached about 5 percent in 2006. Activity was
sustained by construction and government services, both related to tourism and preparations for
the Cricket World Cup (CWC). In 2007, growth is expected to slow to 3¼ percent, due
largely to weakening construction, lackluster performance of the tourism sector, and hurricaneinduced damage to banana production. Inflation remains low under the regional currency board
arrangement.
Fiscal imbalances remained high in 2006. Total tax revenues were strong, buoyed by reforms at
customs. However, petroleum tax collection was poor (given the limited pass-through of world
oil prices), and significant increases occurred in capital expenditures and wages and salaries.
As a result, the overall deficit fell only slightly to 6½ percent of GDP in 2006, and gross public
debt rose to 67 percent of GDP.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
Following a sharp increase in 2006, the external current account deficit is expected to narrow in
2007. The deterioration (to over 32 percent of GDP) was driven by a rapid fall in both the terms
of trade and tourism arrivals, and an increase in imports related to hotel construction and public
capital expenditure for the CWC. Foreign direct investment surged in 2006 (to over 23 percent
of GDP), reflecting tourism-related construction. In 2007 the current account deficit is projected
to narrow on account of a slowdown in tourism-related imports and a moderate rebound in
exports of goods and services.
While St. Lucia’s real exchange rate does not appear to be overvalued, competitiveness
remains a challenge. At end-2006 the real effective exchange rate (REER) was at its lowest
level in nearly 20 years, reflecting the depreciation of the U.S. dollar against major currencies,
and staff analysis indicates that the REER is close to its estimated equilibrium level. However,
there are challenges in maintaining external competitiveness, as real wages have increased,
the terms of trade have deteriorated significantly since 2002, and in recent years St. Lucia has
experienced a decline in its share of stayover visitors to the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union
(ECCU).
Broad money growth remained strong in 2006, and prudential indicators point to a strengthening
of the financial system. Credit to the private sector expanded by 25 percent, attributable to
CWC-related activities and hotel construction. In 2007, growth in private credit is expected to
slow, in line with anticipated real GDP and construction sector growth. While bank provisioning
has been stable and nonperforming loans continue to decline, the credit boom has the potential
to erode the quality of banking system assets, raising the importance of effective financial
supervision.
There has been some progress toward strengthening the financial supervisory and regulatory
framework since the 2004 ECCU regional FSAP. Amendments to the uniform Banking Act were
passed in December 2006, enhancing ECCB regulatory powers and requiring banks to
provision for nonperforming government loans. The authorities have bolstered supervision of
nonbanks through the strengthening of the Financial Services Supervision Unit, and legislation
governing cooperatives, money services institutions and domestic insurance is expected to be
passed by end-2007. However, progress has been slow in developing a broad supervisory
framework to regulate all nonbank financial intermediaries, and while a Single Regulatory Unit
for nonbanks was approved by Cabinet in 2006, it has yet to be fully implemented.
There has also been progress in implementing broad structural reforms. On fiscal issues, the
authorities intend to enhance revenue-raising by the introduction of a more flexible mechanism
for retail fuel pricing and a market valuation-based property tax (both in 2008), and a valueadded tax (in 2009). The erosion of trade preferences for bananas has reduced incomes and
employment prospects for poor rural households, and the authorities have attempted to bolster
the country’s social safety net to alleviate poverty. St. Lucia is one of the world’s most disasterprone countries, and has made good strides in bolstering national disaster mitigation and
preparedness, including by the enhancement of the National Emergency Management
Organization, improvements to the national disaster response plan, and participation in regional
risk pooling.

Executive Board Assessment
Directors welcomed St. Lucia’s recent strong economic performance, marked by robust growth
and low inflation. At the same time, Directors noted that the country faces important challenges,
including the need to diversify the economy, lower unemployment, and reduce the vulnerability
to economic shocks. They encouraged the authorities to build on the country’s strong
foundations, and to continue to work toward the sustained implementation of prudent fiscal
policies and structural reforms.
Directors stressed that fiscal consolidation and reforms are needed to maintain a sustainable
public debt/GDP ratio and enhance fiscal flexibility to respond to exogenous shocks, while
permitting effective public investment and social spending. They welcomed the authorities’
plans to boost revenue through the introduction of a value-added tax, more flexible retail fuel
pricing to achieve greater pass through of oil price increases, property tax assessments based
on market values, and the improvement of tax administration. Directors recommended that tax
incentives be rationalized to reduce revenue losses and promote investment more effectively.
Directors also called for greater expenditure restraint, and welcomed the authorities’ intentions
to reform the civil service, introduce a formal mechanism for evaluating public investments, and
strengthen debt management. While they acknowledged the need for investment in tourismrelated infrastructure to help diversify the economy away from banana production, Directors
advised the authorities to carefully evaluate and prioritize investment projects and to seek
mostly grant and highly concessional financing.
Directors considered that the fixed-exchange rate has served St. Lucia well, and that the real
effective exchange rate appears in line with fundamentals. They emphasized the importance of
prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms to maintain competitiveness and
underpin the exchange rate.
Directors noted that declining non-performing loan ratios and rising profitability point to a
relatively healthy financial sector. They welcomed the measures being taken to further
strengthen the sector, including the planned consolidation of nonbank regulation and
supervision and the improvement of the legal and institutional framework for preventing money
laundering. Given the rapid growth in private sector credit and net foreign liabilities of
commercial banks, Directors recommended that banks’ credit quality and risk management
practices be closely monitored.
Directors recognized that the erosion of trade preferences for bananas is placing a considerable
burden on rural households. They supported the authorities’ plans to provide well-targeted
assistance to the most affected while seeking to restructure the economy away from banana
production. They were encouraged by the relatively low cost of doing business in St. Lucia, and
underlined the importance of labor retraining and increasing labor market flexibility. Directors
stressed the importance of the timely disbursement by donors of the substantial aid committed
to St. Lucia in support of the economic restructuring.

4
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to regional cooperation and integration. In this
regard, they commended St. Lucia’s progress in implementing the requirements of the
Caribbean Single Market and Economy, and in removing non-tariff barriers.
Directors supported the authorities’ ongoing efforts to mitigate the economic impact of natural
disasters, including through the regional pooling of catastrophe risk.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to improve the quality and timeliness of
economic and social statistics, especially the national accounts, the public sector fiscal
accounts, and the balance of payments. They supported Fund technical assistance for this
purpose.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
