DISCUSSIONS

MAIN ISSUES
Recent developments and outlook. The economy has slowed, pulled down by the weak
external environment. Domestic demand, however, has been resilient, buoyed by a
healthy labor market and supportive fiscal policy. In line with the cooling economy,
inflation and credit growth have declined. In 2013, growth is expected to rebound and
inflation to remain moderate.
Property sector. The real estate sector is the main source of domestic risk. Housing
prices have doubled from their trough of 2008, raising concerns about affordability,
demand-supply imbalances, and the potential for a sharp price correction. Appropriate
measures to safeguard the banking system have been taken and should continue to be
fine-tuned in line with evolving risks. Improving affordability and stability of the property
market ultimately hinges on ensuring a sufficient supply of new housing.
External risk. Hong Kong SAR is susceptible to global shocks. This follows by virtue of
being a small economy that is highly open to trade, maintains a currency peg, and serves
as a global financial center. The economy could be hard hit by a European, U.S., or
Mainland shock. In such an event, the authorities should deploy fiscal policy to mitigate
the impact on growth and vulnerable households, while using the existing liquidity
facilities and deposit insurance schemes to ensure financial stability.
Financial sector. Hong Kong SAR’s banking system is well-capitalized and prepared for
Basel III. The authorities have acted preemptively to contain risks, such as those arising
from real estate lending and growing Mainland credit exposures. Policies should
continue, as needed, to be deployed proactively to safeguard the financial system.
External assessment. The currency and external position are assessed to be broadly in
line with fundamentals. The Linked Exchange Rate System remains the best arrangement
for Hong Kong SAR.

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA—HONG KONG SAR

DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
1.
Context. Hong Kong SAR is a small economy that is highly open to trade and capital flows
and serves as an international financial center. As such, the economy is susceptible to regional and
global shocks. Trade, tourism, and financial services are key: gross trade flows amount to some
450 percent of annual GDP, annual tourist arrivals are equivalent to some 600 percent of the
population, and for three of the past four years the equity market has ranked number one globally
in terms of money raised through public offerings. The economic framework is anchored by the
combination of a currency board, flexible markets, a commitment to fiscal discipline, and a strong
emphasis on safeguarding financial stability. This setup has continued to serve Hong Kong SAR well
in cushioning the impact of external shocks and adapting to changes such as rapid growth in the
Mainland.
Real GDP Growth
(In percent)

2.
Growth. Recent weakness in the global economy
is impacting Hong Kong SAR, and real GDP growth is
projected to slow to 1¼ percent this year (Figure 1). The
slowdown is being driven by trade developments, with net
exports expected to subtract 1¾ percentage points from
growth. However, domestic demand is proving resilient
owing to a supportive fiscal stance and continued
strength in the labor market. Unemployment is expected
to remain low, especially in the low-skilled segment,
reflecting buoyant activity in tourism-related sectors and
construction. Next year, GDP growth is expected to
recover to around 3 percent as the drag from net exports
abates.
3.
Inflation. In line with the cooling economy,
consumer price pressures have eased. This has been
helped by declining food inflation, tracking developments
in the Mainland. Inflation is expected to remain moderate,
averaging 3¾ percent this year and 3½ percent next year,
despite continued upward pressure from higher housing
costs. After a short respite late last year, the run-up in
property prices has resumed, defying the general
slowdown in economic activity (see below). The rental
component accounts for 29 percent of the consumer price
index and tends to track the 24-month moving average of
housing rent.

include waiving rates for each rateable property, reductions of public housing rents, increased
transfers, additional capital spending, tax relief, and reductions in fees. Given the economic outlook,
the 2013/14 Budget should continue to be tilted toward supporting growth, consistent with a

modest positive stimulus. The stimulus should be temporary and could include reductions of public
housing rent or tax relief for households. Measures targeted at lower-income households, in
addition to supporting growth, also have social benefits.

5.
Risk of an external shock. A renewed intensification of the euro area crisis and the U.S.
fiscal cliff are the main risks, with potentially large spillover effects through the trade channel. A hard
landing in the Mainland, although a low-probability risk, could also have a significant impact on
Hong Kong SAR’s economy. If any of these shocks materialize, Hong Kong SAR should undertake a
rapid fiscal stimulus that aims to support domestic demand while helping to shield low-income and
vulnerable households. Options include targeted tax relief and increased direct transfers to poor and
vulnerable households, extended support for smaller enterprises (which are important for
employment), and accelerated public infrastructure spending where possible.
6.
Authorities’ views. The authorities broadly agreed with staff forecasts. Uncertainty
stemming from the euro area crisis and the U.S. fiscal cliff would likely weigh on activity in the near
term. The authorities indicated that they had the policy space and the required flexibility to counter
these external threats to activity, should they materialize. They noted that the budget process had
become more forward-looking in recent years and that the 2013/14 Budget (for which the
consultation process has started) would take into consideration the downside external risks.

private residential flats each year. Meanwhile,
mortgage interest rates have remained low in line with U.S. rates, although they have risen
somewhat as banks moved back to using a prime rate (Best Lending Rate), instead of HIBOR, as the
dominant basis for pricing mortgages. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has
implemented several rounds of macro-prudential measures (Text Table 1) that have helped to limit
the growth in mortgage lending and cap household leverage (the average loan-to-value ratio for
new mortgages is around 55 percent). Nonetheless, the low global interest rate environment is
making real estate an attractive investment. Mainland buyers have also been active in the market
and, in 2011, accounted for nearly 20 percent of primary market transactions (around 50 percent in
value terms according to market estimates).

represents half of outstanding loans for use in Hong Kong SAR, with additional risks coming from
the use of real estate as collateral. A sharp price correction would lead to falling collateral values and
negative wealth effects, which could trigger an adverse feedback loop between domestic demand,
bank lending, and the property market. Moreover, mortgage rates were falling in the early 2000s—

Box 1. Housing Prices
Assessing whether housing prices are out of line with economic fundamentals is an important yet
inherently difficult exercise. Two different pricing models are examined, which provide some mild,
Premium Property Price and Housing Affordability
but on balance inconclusive, evidence that prices are

Housing Affordability

higher than suggested by current fundamentals.

(Major Markets)

A regression-based approach indicates prices are
about 10 percent above the level suggested by
current macroeconomic fundamentals.1 However, the
fundamentals themselves are in some sense
abnormal, as loose global monetary conditions have
pushed down considerably Hong Kong SAR’s real
interest rate. The real interest rate, moreover, is a key
driver of housing prices in the model. To illustrate the
impact of the eventual normalization of global
monetary conditions, the regression estimates were
used to calculate the price that would prevail if the
real interest rate was at its 2003–07 average, with a
concomitant change to credit. This exercise suggests
that housing prices are some 30 percent higher than
they would be if Hong Kong SAR’s real interest rate
returned to the 2003–07 average.

Hong Kong SAR

Housing in Hong Kong SAR is expensive. Compared
to other regions, house prices in Hong Kong SAR are
less affordable as measured by the ratio of median
household income to median house price. In absolute
terms, U.S. dollars per square meter, prices are also
relatively expensive and premium real estate prices
are on par or higher than in other high-cost housing.

Kong SAR mortgage rates associated with the eventual normalization of U.S. interest rates could
exacerbate or trigger a price correction.
9.
Property market policies. The HKMA has been proactively implementing macro-prudential
measures, such as progressively tightening loan-to-value and debt service ratios (Text Table 1). As
conditions evolve, these measures can continue to be adapted and potentially complemented by
deploying additional tools, including higher risk weights or regulatory reserves. Such macroprudential measures should remain focused on safeguarding the banking system, while other
policies are best suited to fostering the stable development of the housing market, preventing
unhealthy price dynamics, and addressing affordability concerns. The management of land supply,
which in Hong Kong SAR is mainly provided by the government, is critical for ensuring sufficient
availability of housing over the medium term. However, given the 3–5 years needed to develop a
housing project, planned increases in land supply will have a limited upfront market impact (mainly
through expectations). In the interim, measures to dampen housing demand, such as the recently
adopted Buyer’s Stamp Duty and extension of the Special Stamp Duty, could help contain unhealthy
price dynamics. As the impact is assessed over time, these stamp duties could be adjusted further if
needed. Taken together, the government’s recent steps to promote demand-supply balance should
help improve affordability, while public housing programs—which extend to nearly half of Hong
Kong SAR’s households—continue to provide a safety net for residents that would otherwise be
priced out of the market.
10.
Authorities’ views. The authorities emphasized that they had been actively implementing
policies to mitigate property sector risks. They considered boosting land supply as critical to the
stable development of the property market over the longer term. However, the lags involved with
development created the need for measures (such as the recent stamp duties) to discourage
exuberance in the short run. They also placed high priority on ensuring that the financial system
would remain resilient to a downturn in prices. The authorities underscored that the five rounds of
macro-prudential measures since 2009 had left bank and household balance sheets in a strong
position to weather such a downturn. They planned to continue to closely monitor property market
developments, and stood ready to take additional macro-prudential steps if needed. The authorities
emphasized that affordability was also a critical concern, and that they remain committed to
ensuring an adequate supply of public housing and ensuring all eligible families receive an offer of
public housing on average within three years of applying.

Financial developments. Bank credit
growth, a key concern in recent years, has
decelerated significantly in line with slowing
economic activity, tighter macro-prudential
policy, and less new lending to the Mainland
(Figure 3). Hong Kong SAR’s banking system
remains well-capitalized and liquid, while asset
quality and profitability have proven resilient to
the recent turmoil in the global economy.
Although IPO activity has been slow this year, the
equity market has rebounded recently and
corporate bond issuance has been strong. This
includes issuance by local companies who have
increasingly used capital markets as the supply
of longer-term bank lending has tightened.

12.
Macro-prudential measures. The preemptive use of macro-prudential tools has been
effective in protecting the financial system. In addition to the measures deployed to contain real
estate risks, the HKMA has set bank-specific regulatory reserves—reserves that banks are required
to hold beyond individual and collective impairment allowances—to contain risks such as those
arising from rapid credit growth. Macro-prudential measures should continue to be adjusted in line
with the evolving credit cycle, and consideration could be given to using additional instruments such
as increasing provisioning or risk weights for certain types of lending.

environment where nonresident banks may be effectively
subordinated in the case of payment problems and where collateral enforcement procedures are
largely untested. To identify emerging risks, the HKMA should continue to stress test and closely
monitor banks’ exposures, including through close cooperation with the Mainland authorities, and
to ensure that banks maintain prudent underwriting standards and hold adequate buffers that
reflect the specific risks from Mainland-related exposures.

Cross-border use of renminbi. Renminbi internationalization continues to benefit Hong
Kong SAR, which remains the main offshore renminbi center. After growing rapidly through late
2011, the share of renminbi deposits has stabilized at around 9 percent of total system deposits,
which reflects an increase in alternative renminbi assets (especially certificates of deposit), as well as
a change in market expectations on renminbi appreciation (Figure 4 and Box 2). The extension of
operating hours for the renminbi real-time gross settlement system, introduction of dual-counter
equities (issued and traded in both Hong Kong dollar and renminbi), allowing nonresidents to hold
unlimited renminbi deposits, and introduction of investment funds providing exposure to Mainland
bonds and equities have helped Hong Kong SAR’s status as the preeminent offshore renminbi
center. To consolidate Hong Kong SAR’s first-mover advantage, the authorities should continue to
develop the renminbi financial infrastructure.
15.
Financial spillovers. To gain insights on how a financial shock could reverberate through
Hong Kong SAR, staff applied a network analysis to BIS data. The results show that in the event of
distress in a foreign banking system, a rise in counterparty risk (similar to that observed after the
collapse of Lehman) could lead to a sharp decline in cross-border interbank funding, fire-sale of
bank assets, a fall in banks’ capital, and a reduction in bank credit (Box 3). In the event of a large
shock, the authorities could respond by providing liquidity via the discount window, foreign
exchange swaps, term repos, and other suitable tools, such as the renminbi liquidity facility. The
existing Deposit Protection Scheme should be sufficient to provide confidence to depositors. If
needed as a last resort, the broad-based guarantee of deposits introduced after the fallout of
Lehman could be reconsidered, in close coordination with other jurisdictions. The network analysis
also illustrates how preventing market dislocation in Hong Kong SAR would help limit contagion
arising from a global shock.
16.
Basel III. There was a general consensus among officials, private analysts, and staff that
Hong Kong SAR banks are well positioned to meet the Basel III standards. Some analysts argued
that the capital and liquidity rules are likely to have a larger-than-expected impact on the business
models of banks in Hong Kong SAR. For instance, they could discourage trade finance and longdated (syndicated) loans, and create a heavy demand for liquid assets (such as sovereign debt) that,
depending on the eventual rules, may be in short supply in some jurisdictions. Others, however,
highlighted that the financial system was highly adaptable and would adjust to the new rules—the
recent growth in bond issuance in Hong Kong SAR was cited as an example whereby firms go
straight to the capital markets for longer-term funding that under Basel III will be more expensive
for banks to provide.
17.
Authorities’ views. The authorities noted that closer financial integration with the Mainland
had provided an important growth opportunity for the banking system. At the same time, they were
closely monitoring Mainland exposures and highlighted that 60 percent of them were collateralized,
often by deposits at a Mainland bank or assets held in Hong Kong SAR. The HKMA, in collaboration
with the Mainland bank regulator, has been conducting annual on-site inspections at Mainland
subsidiaries of Hong Kong SAR banks to ensure that their underwriting standards are similar to the
ones maintained in Hong Kong SAR. In addition, higher regulatory reserves had been imposed on

Box 2. Has Renminbi Internationalization Led to an Integration of
Offshore and Onshore Markets?
Several significant steps have been taken to expand offshore renminbi intermediation in Hong Kong SAR
since 2004. The range of renminbi financial products and services offered in Hong Kong SAR has steadily
widened to now include deposits, Dim-Sum bonds, trade settlement, and structured deposits linked to
underlying indices such as property, gold, and equity. Furthermore, the channels that allow offshore
renminbi to flow back to the Mainland have been increased and include interbank bond, equity and fixed
income markets (subject to quotas) and inward FDI (subject to approval). The expansion in trade settlement
in renminbi has contributed to a rapid buildup in offshore renminbi liquidity with renminbi deposits
stabilizing more recently at RMB 571 billion. Similarly, measures facilitating FDI in renminbi has supported
the expansion of the offshore Dim-Sum market to RMB 237 billion at end-November. Also, Hong Kong
banks have rapidly increased renminbi lending, which doubled this to RMB 68 billion at
end-September 2012.
To assess how effective these developments have been in

A Threshold Autoregressive Model (TAR) is used to estimate a “no-arbitrage band” around the CNY-CNH
differential.1 The results show that the differential was within the no-arbitrage band 56 percent of the time,
but that there were also extended periods when the differential was large and outside the band. The fact
that the differential converges fairly slowly to the band is consistent with the CNH and CNY markets being
somewhat segmented, at least enough to prevent financial arbitrage from immediately closing the
differential. Nonetheless, the markets are also integrated enough that capital flows work over time to close
the differential.

The TAR model estimates a band around a variable (the CNY-CNH differential) such that within the band the variable

follows a random walk (meaning arbitrage is not taking place) and outside the band in which the variable mean reverts to
the band, consistent with arbitrage. R. S. Craig, C. Hua, P. Ng, and R. Yuen, IMF Working Paper, forthcoming.

Box 3. Analysis of the Spillover Risk of the Domestic Banking System 1/
As a hub for global financial intermediation, Hong Kong SAR’s banking system would be impacted by financial distress
elsewhere in the world. At the same time, by securing its own financial stability, Hong Kong SAR could help prevent the
propagation of financial shocks. This box examines the linkages of Hong Kong SAR’s banking system with the global
financial system to assess the potential for such outward and inward spillovers.
Network analysis is used to model how distress could spread from one economy to another. The methodology
follows Espinosa-Vega and Sole (2011) and Arslanalp and Lam (2012), which was applied in several FSAP analyses (such
as Australia, Japan, and Spain), and uses the same key assumptions and parameters. 2 It exploits data on cross-border
claims and economy-specific measures of banking system resilience. Distress is modeled as a credit shock that causes a
banking system to default on its cross-border obligations, a funding shock that results in a liquidity squeeze and fire sale
of assets, or a combined credit and funding shock. The analysis considers scenarios that allow for progressively wider
spillover channels: Scenario 1 (S1) considers just interbank exposures; Scenario 2 (S2) adds contingent cross-border
claims, such as outstanding derivative contracts or contingent liabilities (for example guarantees or credit commitments);
and Scenario 3 (S3) adds nonbank and sovereign exposures.

spillovers to other economies that would be infected by a U.S. or
U.K. distress, which creates a domino effect of global distress that ultimately has a large impact on Hong Kong SAR. The
Mainland, in contrast, is less integrated globally and, in particular, a Mainland funding shock would have fewer
repercussions for Hong Kong SAR then a similar shock in the
U.S. or U.K. banking systems.
Global Impact of Banking Distress (percent global capital) 1/
Likewise, a strong policy response in Hong Kong SAR
could help break this domino effect to the benefit of
other economies. Safeguarding Hong Kong SAR’s banking
system through strong capital and liquidity buffers,
providing timely liquidity support, and bolstering confidence
would prevent a shock in another economy from
propagating through Hong Kong SAR’s banks. For example,
in the case of a combined credit and funding shock in China
under Scenario 1, a strong policy response by Hong Kong
SAR would reduce the impact on the global banking system
by an amount equivalent to 1½ percentage points of total
global capital (see table, China row, far right two columns).

banks whose loan books had expanded more rapidly. More broadly, the HKMA indicated that they
would continue to adjust macro-prudential measures as the cycle evolves, and were open to
considering additional tools. Regarding international regulatory reform, the authorities reiterated
their commitment to Basel III and noted that the implementing regulations had been presented for
Legislative Council vetting. More broadly, they considered robust and evenly implemented
standards critical for ensuring confidence in the global financial system and flagged the importance
of avoiding a watering-down of the standards or delays in implementation.

integration with the Mainland deepens, the current
account surplus is projected to rise to around 7 percent of GDP. A structural current account surplus
of this magnitude is assessed as consistent with Hong Kong SAR’s status as an international financial
center. Both external financial assets and liabilities are very high, around 10 times GDP, reflecting
Hong Kong SAR’s status as a major international financial center with considerable cross-border
investment. These assets and liabilities could pose vulnerabilities, including through maturity
mismatches, though these risks are mitigated by Hong Kong SAR’s large official reserve holdings (of
over 100 percent of GDP). The net foreign asset position is expected to rise gradually over time
given the persistent current account surplus, and IIP vulnerabilities are low. Overall, the currency and
external position are assessed to be broadly in line with fundamentals.

Box 4. External Assessment
While the ongoing structural changes in the Hong Kong economy and its financial center status make it
difficult to draw a definitive conclusion on the presence of misalignment, available empirical methodologies do
not indicate that the current level of the Hong Kong dollar is out of line with medium-term fundamentals.
As in previous years, a number of empirical

CGER or the External Balance Assessment (EBA), in
part because these techniques are not well suited for offshore financial centers. However, a CGER-type
methodology is also reported along with estimates provided by the HKMA.
 The macroeconomic balance approach compares the projected medium-term current account balance
with an estimated equilibrium current account position and assesses the exchange rate adjustment needed
to eliminate the gap between the two. Estimates for Hong Kong SAR generally indicate an equilibrium
medium-term current account in the range of 6–7 percent of GDP. Consistent with last year’s assessment
and the pilot External Sector Report, the current account balance is assessed to be broadly in line with
fundamentals and estimates of misalignment from the two panel regression approaches are near zero. The
CGER-type regression yields a 14 percent undervaluation, with around half of the difference coming from
the assumptions on real exchange rate (the panel regressions include some future real appreciation resulting
from Hong Kong SAR having somewhat higher inflation than its trading partners, consistent with the
medium-term macro-framework, whereas the CGER-type assumes an unchanged real exchange rate).
 The equilibrium real exchange rate approach compares the current level of the real exchange rate with
an estimated equilibrium level based on medium-term fundamentals. Estimates of the equilibrium real
exchange rate generally show the Hong Kong dollar to be undervalued by 6–15 percent.
 The external sustainability approach calculates the exchange rate adjustment needed over the medium
term to bring the current account to a position that would stabilize the net foreign asset position at a
benchmark level. The range of assessments generated by this approach is much broader going from
modestly overvalued to moderately undervalued, and is largely due to different assumptions regarding the
benchmark level, growth, and rates of return on assets and liabilities.
Overall, the results are sensitive to specification and sample coverage, with estimates of misalignment
ranging on both sides of zero.

Policy discussions. Following the extensive discussion in last year’s Article IV consultation,
the mission reviewed the exchange rate regime options and concluded that the LERS remains
superior to the alternatives. The arguments for maintaining the LERS are compelling, given that it
has generated substantial benefits in terms of monetary and financial stability, built up a stock of
credibility over the decades, and kept the real exchange rate broadly in line with fundamentals. It
works because Hong Kong SAR’s economy is highly flexible, with nominal prices and wages
adjusting to the changing environment to prevent sizable or persistent misalignments. The
additional requisites to sustain the LERS, besides the aforementioned economic flexibility, are in
place including a track record of fiscal discipline that is anchored by significant fiscal reserves, and
robust financial sector regulation and supervision. As for the alternatives, a step revaluation would
undermine the credibility of the system and fuel expectations of future adjustments, and in any
event is unnecessary as the exchange rate is not out of line with fundamentals. Moving to a different
peg or a crawling arrangement would suffer from similar drawbacks, and in practice would not yield
any greater monetary policy autonomy. Regarding the option of linking to the renminbi, it would
also prove problematic at this juncture because the renminbi is not convertible, the Mainland has
substantial capital account restrictions, and renminbi financial markets are not sufficiently developed
to manage a large portfolio of renminbi assets. Moreover, Hong Kong SAR’s productivity and
competitiveness is likely to evolve more in line with those of the United States than of the relatively
less developed and faster growing Mainland. Finally, a floating regime could give some scope for an
independent monetary policy, but would be difficult to manage for a very small, very open,
international financial center where capital flows dwarf the size of the domestic economy. The
nominal exchange rate would be subject to large fluctuations that would lead to significant volatility
in domestic prices or the real exchange rate.
21.
Authorities’ views. The authorities remained firmly committed to the LERS, which they
considered to be the most appropriate arrangement for Hong Kong SAR. They assessed the real
exchange rate to be in line with fundamentals, and highlighted that it is through the adjustment of
prices and wages that this equilibrium is maintained. This economic flexibility, on top of their firm
commitment to fiscal discipline and financial stability, has underpinned the success of the LERS. They
noted that the recent triggering of the convertibility undertaking is not a source of concern and that
the LERS can accommodate such movement in capital flows.

redress it. A minimum wage of HK$28 (US$3.6) per hour was introduced in 2011, and the rate is
currently undergoing a periodic review as envisaged under the law. The 2012/13 Budget includes tax
and other forms of relief for low-income groups, such as reductions of public housing rent. A key
area of concern is housing, where rising prices and rent are squeezing many lower and middle
income residents out of the private property market. Some observers commented that the absence
of an official poverty line makes it difficult to assess developments.
23.
Authorities’ views. The authorities noted that the significant rise in the Gini coefficient over
the past decade was not representative of developments and questioned whether Gini comparisons
between city-scale financial centers and larger economies were appropriate. Moreover, once
government programs were taken into account, inequality had not risen over the past five years.
Official data show that a Gini coefficient that takes into account the effect of government programs
has remained unchanged at 0.475 between 2006 and 2011. A set of poverty indicators developed by
a former Commission on Poverty (in existence during 2005–07) have shown a broad-based
improvement over the past decade (some examples include the declining number of recipients of
Comprehensive Social Security Allowance (CSSA) and improvements in education enrollment).
Moreover, the government recently reinstated the Commission on Poverty and tasked it to establish
a poverty line for Hong Kong SAR, examine current poverty situation and causes of poverty, review
existing policies, and formulate new policies to improve livelihoods, promote social mobility, and
provide a safety net to better help the disadvantaged.

B. Economic volatility
24.
Is Hong Kong SAR’ economy more volatile? Without an independent monetary policy or
an exchange rate to absorb shocks, a currency board system could result in higher economic
volatility. Staff analysis examined both the average level and volatility of GDP growth, consumer
price inflation, and housing price inflation, while controlling for factors such as the exchange rate
regime, policy stance, and terms of trade. 1 The results show that GDP growth in Hong Kong SAR has
indeed been somewhat more volatile than in other economies (Figure 6). However, the averages of
GDP growth and inflation (for both consumer goods and housing prices) have been on par with
other economies.
25.
Counter-cyclical fiscal policy. The absence of an independent monetary policy means that
fiscal policy the main tool for managing demand and reducing output volatility. Hong Kong SAR has
ample fiscal space for counter-cyclical fiscal policy thanks to a history of prudence, which has built
fiscal reserves to over 30 percent of GDP. Since automatic stabilizers in Hong Kong SAR are small, a
heavier burden is put on discretionary policy. Staff research indicates that despite smaller automatic
stabilizers, Hong Kong SAR’s fiscal policy has been effective in reducing output volatility (Box 5).2

Box 5. Has Fiscal Policy been Counter-Cyclical? A Cross Country Comparison
The nature of Hong Kong SAR’s economy makes it susceptible to external shocks. Moreover, since the
currency board takes away the option of using monetary policy, fiscal policy is the main lever for demand
management. In comparison with other advanced economies, Hong Kong SAR has been relatively
effective in using this lever to reduce output volatility.
At first sight, budget policy in Hong Kong SAR appears to be counter-cyclical. The surplus tends to
decline when the output gap widens and then reverses when the gap closes. A simple regression of the
change in the overall balance on the output gap confirms this relationship and suggests that the fiscal
surplus is reduced by ½ percent of GDP for each 1 percentage point widening of the output gap.
Still, fiscal policy in Hong Kong SAR seems to be less
counter-cyclical than in other advanced economies. One
factor is that Hong Kong SAR has small automatic
stabilizers, which is a direct reflection of the relatively
small size of government (spending averages less than
20 percent of GDP). Indeed, Hong Kong SAR has among
the smallest automatic stabilizers in the sample.

However, Hong Kong SAR has been relatively successful in 0.2
using discretionary fiscal policy—as measured by changes

the small automatic stabilizers. The above regressions provide a simple measure of counter-cyclicality,
but do not control for the reverse causal impact of fiscal policy on the output gap. This is a potentially
significant shortcoming. For example, a government that succeeded in adjusting the deficit to eliminate
all fluctuations in the output gap would be found to have no counter-cyclicality (the regression
coefficient would be zero).

Staff discussed whether it could be beneficial to make the budget even more responsive to the
business cycle, such as by developing a list of “shovel-ready” infrastructure projects or making it
easier to adjust policies and spending to changes in the economy. In doing so, it would be critical
not to undermine Hong Kong SAR’s hard-won fiscal credibility, by ensuring that any stimulus during
economic slowdowns was offset by tightening during economic booms. The openness of Hong
Kong SAR suggests that fiscal multipliers are likely somewhat smaller than in other economies since
part of fiscal spending leaks abroad via imports. Nonetheless, counter-cyclical fiscal policy would still
be warranted given the beneficial social impact, and could usefully focus on shielding the poor and
vulnerable from shocks.
26.
Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed that fiscal policy had been counter-cyclical, and
underscored that this reflected their intent. They noted that the existing budget institutions already
provided enough flexibility to respond to changing circumstances, including during the fiscal year
when necessary. Additional room for maneuver is provided by the possibility of introducing a
supplementary, mid-year budget as was done during the 2009/10 fiscal year following the collapse
of Lehman Brothers. Infrastructure spending, moreover, was being scaled up in line with mediumterm plans, but the size, complexity, and planning involved made it less amenable to being finetuned to match the business cycle. They considered other measures they have used to be more
effective, such as social spending and support to small businesses. They agreed that multipliers were
probably somewhat smaller in Hong Kong SAR given the import leakage. Finally, they emphasized
that preserving fiscal discipline was of paramount importance and critical for fostering
macroeconomic stability and supporting the LERS.

STAFF APPRAISAL
27.
Macroeconomic context. Hong Kong SAR is weathering the global economic storms fairly
well. Weakening external demand is dragging down growth, but the domestic economy is proving
resilient buoyed by supportive fiscal policy and continued strength in construction and tourismrelated sectors. Unemployment remains low. Inflation has declined on the heels of the slowing
economy and easing of food price pressures in the Mainland. Looking forward, growth is expected
to recover in line with the improved global economy while inflation is forecast to remain within a
comfortable range. Nonetheless, as a small and highly open economy, Hong Kong SAR remains
susceptible to external shocks and would strongly feel the effects of a worsening of the euro area
crisis, the U.S fiscal cliff, or a hard-landing in the Mainland.
28.
Fiscal policy. The absence of an independent monetary policy means that fiscal policy is the
main tool for demand management. Overall, Hong Kong SAR’s fiscal policy has been effective in
reducing output volatility thanks to the active use of discretionary policies. That includes 2012, with
fiscal policy providing timely support to help counter the impact from slowing external demand. The
2013/14 budget should continue to be supportive of demand and, in the event of an external shock,
fiscal policy should be deployed to provide further stimulus and protect low-income and vulnerable
households. To prevent an erosion of fiscal discipline, it would be critical to ensure that policies are
applied symmetrically through the business cycle, with stimulus being withdrawn as the economy

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA—HONG KONG SAR

recovers. Hong Kong SAR’s history of fiscal prudence, which has built fiscal reserves to over
30 percent of GDP, provides an important backbone to the economy.
29.
Property sector. While the probability of a correction large enough to generate major
macroeconomic and financial consequences is fairly low in the near term, the property sector is the
main source of domestic economic risk. Policies on a variety of fronts are needed to contain
macroeconomic and financial risks from the housing market. The authorities have taken appropriate
macro-prudential measures to help safeguard the banking system. These measures should continue
to be fine-tuned in line with evolving risks and, if needed, additional measures could be deployed.
Macro-prudential measures should, however, remain focused on safeguarding financial stability,
while other policies—such as fiscal measures—can best be used to address broader concerns about
demand-supply imbalances and affordability. Improving affordability ultimately hinges on a
sufficient provision of new housing. Therefore, the government’s efforts to ensure a steady and
adequate supply going forward, including through public housing, are welcome, although the
impact may be limited in the short run given planning and construction lags.
30.
Financial sector. Hong Kong SAR’s banking system remains well capitalized, putting it in a
good place to start implementing Basel III standards in 2013. The authorities have moved proactively
to contain risks in the financial system. The slowdown in credit growth is welcome, as are the
targeted measures to contain risks in real estate lending and efforts to closely monitor and supervise
Mainland exposures. The HKMA should continue to assess evolving risks and, as needed, could
deploy additional macro-prudential measures, tighten underwriting standards, and ask banks to
increase buffers. As a financial center, Hong Kong SAR would feel the impact of a global financial
shock. Bank distress elsewhere in the world could spill over into Hong Kong SAR, with shocks
emanating in the United States or the Mainland having the largest potential impact. Hong Kong
SAR’s existing liquidity facilities and deposit protection scheme should prove sufficient to maintain
financial stability, but, in an extreme shock, additional measures could be considered in conjunction
with other jurisdictions. The ongoing opening of the Mainland’s capital account and expanded
international use of renminbi provide further opportunities for Hong Kong SAR to strengthen its
position as an international financial center. The FSAP scheduled for next year will afford an
opportunity to explore financial sector issues in greater depth.
31.
Exchange rate regime. The Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) is a transparent, credible,
and effective exchange rate regime and warrants continued support as the best arrangement for
Hong Kong SAR. Hong Kong SAR has an economic system that adjusts to the changing environment
through movements in nominal wages and prices. The preconditions to sustain such a system—
including a strong fiscal position, robust and proactive financial oversight, and flexible labor,
product, and asset markets—are in place. Hong Kong SAR’s economic flexibility facilitates a quick
and effective adjustment of the real exchange rate so as to avoid sizable or persistent
misalignments. The Hong Kong dollar and external position are assessed to be broadly in line with
fundamentals.

32.
Income inequality. Fostering inclusive growth is an ongoing concern. Hong Kong SAR’s
economic flexibility and reliance on free-market principles are sources of economic strength and
resilience which, however, can also result in income inequality given the importance of skill-based
wage premiums. Moreover, the high and rising cost of housing is straining the budget of many
lower- and middle-income families. The authorities have implemented an array of measures—
including the statutory minimum wage and planned increases in public housing—geared toward
improving the living standards of lower-income households. Weight should continue to be placed
on policies to reinforce the existing social welfare programs and provide support and opportunities
to lower-income households.
33.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation discussions take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

ANNEX I. HONG KONG SAR—FUND RELATIONS
I.

Membership Status

As a Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong SAR is not a
member of the Fund. However, annual consultation discussions have been held with the
Hong Kong SAR authorities since October 1990, and the staff also holds discussions with the
authorities in connection with the Fund’s Global Financial Stability reports. STA has provided
Hong Kong SAR with technical assistance in the area of balance of payments statistics and
Hong Kong SAR officials have attended IMF Institute courses on balance of payments and monetary
statistics, and financial programming. Hong Kong SAR has requested a Financial Sector Assessment
Program, which will be undertaken in FY 2014.
II.

Exchange Rate Arrangement

The Hong Kong dollar has been linked to the U.S. dollar under a currency board arrangement, the
Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), since October 1983 at a rate of HK$7.8/US$1. The Hong Kong
Monetary Authority (HKMA) refined the operations of the LERS in May 2005—the first changes since
September 1998. For the first time since the introduction of the LERS in 1983, the HKMA explicitly
committed to sell Hong Kong dollar at a pre-announced price (set at HK$7.75/US$), which is
referred to as the strong-side convertibility undertaking. Previously, the HKMA had only committed
to buy Hong Kong dollar at a pre-announced rate (the weak-side convertibility undertaking
introduced in October 1998) and could sell Hong Kong dollar at any price. Along with this two-way
convertibility undertaking, the HKMA also introduced a symmetric trading band of 0.6 percent
around a central parity of HK$7.8/US$. There are no restrictions on current or capital account
transactions in Hong Kong SAR, and the Hong Kong dollar is freely convertible. The People’s
Republic of China accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of
Agreement on December 1, 1996.
III.

Resident Representative

The Hong Kong SAR sub-office of the Beijing Resident Representative’s office was opened on
September 23, 2000. Messrs. Sean Craig and Andre Meier are Resident Representatives.

ANNEX II. HONG KONG SAR—STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate for surveillance purposes. Hong Kong SAR provides statistics to the Fund
on a timely basis for surveillance and publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS).
Hong Kong SAR subscribes to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard and is fully compliant
with its requirements.
Hong Kong SAR publishes comprehensive balance of payments data and international investment
position statistics for 2000 onwards, and also publishes quarterly external debt statistics according
to the recommendations given in the External Debt Statistics: Guide for Compilers and Users.
Hong Kong SAR reports both cash and accrual-based annual data for the general government
according to the Fund’s Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM 1986 and GFSM 2001,
respectively). No subannual data are provided for publication in the IFS.
Hong Kong SAR participates in regular reporting of Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) to the IMF
for dissemination. The reported data are quarterly and cover all core FSIs and 12 additional FSIs for
the deposit takers sector.
In late 2009, the HKMA began reporting quarterly monetary data using Standardized Report Forms
(SRFs) that present data consistent with the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. However, the
SRF data for Hong Kong SAR have not been published in IFS, which uses monthly data periodicity.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
People’s Republic of China—Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
On January 9, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation 1 with Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), and
considered and endorsed the staff appraisal without a meeting on a lapse of time basis 2.
Background
Real GDP growth in Hong Kong SAR is projected to slow to 1¼ percent in 2012, pulled down by
the weak external environment. However, domestic demand has been resilient, buoyed by a
healthy labor market and supportive fiscal policy. Fiscal measures include waiving rates,
reductions of public housing rent, tax relief to households, and increases in social spending.
Consumer price pressures have eased, in line with the cooling economy.
After a short respite in late-2011, the rapid run-up in property prices has resumed. Prices
increased by 23 percent in the first ten months of 2012 and have doubled from their 2008
trough. The rise in mass market prices has been particularly pronounced of late and the rental
market is following a similar trend. The loan-to-value ratio for mortgages has remained at
around 55 percent.
Overall bank credit growth, a key concern in recent years, has decelerated significantly in line
with slowing economic activity and tighter macro-prudential policy. Hong Kong SAR’s banking
system asset quality and profitability has proven resilient to the recent turmoil in the global
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board.

economy. Although IPO activity has been slow, the equity market has recently rebounded, and
corporate bond issuance has been strong.
Financial integration with the Mainland has continued. Over the past few years, Hong Kong
SAR’s banking system claims on Mainland borrowers have grown significantly and accounted
for 28 percent of Hong Kong SAR banks’ total external claims as of end-June 2012. After
growing rapidly through late 2011, the share of renminbi deposits has stabilized at around
9 percent of total system deposits.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2012 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong SAR, Executive Directors
endorsed staff’s appraisal as follows:
Hong Kong SAR is weathering the global economic storms fairly well. Weakening external
demand is dragging down growth, but the domestic economy is proving resilient buoyed by
supportive fiscal policy and continued strength in construction and tourism-related sectors.
Unemployment remains low. Inflation has declined on the heels of the slowing economy and
easing of food price pressures in the Mainland. Looking forward, growth is expected to recover
in line with the improved global economy while inflation is forecast to remain within a
comfortable range. Nonetheless, as a small and highly open economy, Hong Kong SAR
remains susceptible to external shocks and would strongly feel the effects of a worsening of the
euro area crisis, the U.S fiscal cliff, or a hard-landing in the Mainland.
The absence of an independent monetary policy means that fiscal policy is the main tool for
demand management. Overall, Hong Kong SAR’s fiscal policy has been effective in reducing
output volatility thanks to the active use of discretionary policies. That includes 2012, with fiscal
policy providing timely support to help counter the impact from slowing external demand. Next
year’s budget should continue to be supportive of demand and, in the event of an external
shock, fiscal policy should be deployed to provide further stimulus and protect low-income and
vulnerable households. To prevent an erosion of fiscal discipline, it would be critical to ensure
that policies are applied symmetrically through the business cycle, with stimulus being
withdrawn as the economy recovers. Hong Kong SAR’s history of fiscal prudence, which has
built fiscal reserves to over 30 percent of GDP, provides an important backbone to the
economy.
While the probability of a correction large enough to generate major macroeconomic and
financial consequences is fairly low in the near term, the property sector is the main source of
domestic economic risk. Policies on a variety of fronts are needed to contain macroeconomic
and financial risks from the housing market. The authorities have taken appropriate macroprudential measures to help safeguard the banking system. These measures should continue to
be fine-tuned in line with evolving risks and, if needed, additional measures could be deployed.
Macro-prudential measures should, however, remain focused on safeguarding financial stability,
while other policies—such as fiscal measures—can best be used to address broader concerns
about demand-supply imbalances and affordability. Improving affordability ultimately hinges on

3
a sufficient provision of new housing. Therefore, the government’s efforts to ensure a steady
and adequate supply going forward, including through public housing, are welcome, although
the impact may be limited in the short run given planning and construction lags.
Hong Kong SAR’s banking system remains well capitalized, putting it in a good place to start
implementing Basel III standards in 2013. The authorities have moved proactively to contain
risks in the financial system. The slowdown in credit growth is welcome, as are the targeted
measures to contain risks in real estate lending and efforts to closely monitor and supervise
Mainland exposures. The HKMA should continue to assess evolving risks and, as needed,
could deploy additional macro-prudential measures, tighten underwriting standards, and ask
banks to increase buffers. As a financial center, Hong Kong SAR would feel the impact of a
global financial shock. Bank distress elsewhere in the world could spill over into Hong Kong
SAR, with shocks emanating in the United States or the Mainland having the largest potential
impact. Hong Kong SAR’s existing liquidity facilities and deposit protection scheme should
prove sufficient to maintain financial stability, but, in an extreme shock, additional measures
could be considered in conjunction with other jurisdictions. The ongoing opening of the
Mainland’s capital account and expanded international use of renminbi provide further
opportunities for Hong Kong SAR to strengthen its position as an international financial center.
The Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) scheduled for next year will afford an
opportunity to explore financial sector issues in greater depth.
The Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) is a transparent, credible, and effective exchange
rate regime and warrants continued support as the best arrangement for Hong Kong SAR. Hong
Kong SAR has an economic system that adjusts to the changing environment through
movements in nominal wages and prices. The preconditions to sustain such a system—
including a strong fiscal position, robust and proactive financial oversight, and flexible labor,
product, and asset markets—are in place. Hong Kong SAR’s economic flexibility facilitates a
quick and effective adjustment of the real exchange rate so as to avoid sizable or persistent
misalignments. The Hong Kong dollar and external position are assessed to be broadly in line
with fundamentals.
Fostering inclusive growth is an ongoing concern. Hong Kong SAR’s economic flexibility and
reliance on free-market principles are sources of economic strength and resilience which,
however, can also result in income inequality given the importance of skill-based wage
premiums. Moreover, the high and rising cost of housing is straining the budget of many lowerand middle-income families. The authorities have implemented an array of measures—including
the statutory minimum wage and planned increases in public housing—geared toward
improving the living standards of lower-income households. Weight should continue to be
placed on policies to reinforce the existing social welfare programs and provide support and
opportunities to lower-income households.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
Reader to view this pdf file) for the 2012 Article IV Consultation with Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region is also available.
