STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 29, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Outlook and risks. The economy continues to grow at a rate below trend, in part
reflecting the effects of the recent drought, and inflation pressures are subdued. Rising
house prices, which are already elevated by standard metrics, are a growing concern, as
they could lead to an increase in debt-financed household spending which would put
pressure on aggregated demand, and increase the risk of an abrupt price correction.
Other threats include the financial and economic fallout from an intensification of
European sovereign debt problems and a slowdown in China, Australia, and other parts
of Asia, although these events have receded somewhat as near term risks. The
authorities have macroeconomic policy space to respond to adverse shocks, and the
flexible exchange rate would serve as an important buffer.
Medium- and long-term challenges. New Zealand’s external debt is high by
international standards, making it desirable to raise the national savings rate. The
ongoing fiscal deficit reduction contributes to this aim. The banks, although wellcapitalized, face longstanding structural issues that will remain sources of financial sector
risk over the medium term. Ample global liquidity is likely to keep the exchange rate
elevated, which could keep the current account deficit high relative to its long-run
sustainable level. Macroeconomic management will need to cope with large, sustained
earthquake-related reconstruction spending, expected to peak sometime mid-decade.
Policy assessment. With expected inflation within the target range, the strong New
Zealand dollar, and the government’s efforts to reduce the budget deficit, monetary
policy should remain accommodative, and act as the first line of defense against shocks.
At the same time, the authorities should be prepared to apply stricter macro-prudential
standards to prevent an acceleration of house price inflation.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Output. Growth appears to have strengthened in the last months of 2012 and is estimated
at 2½ percent for the year, as subdued household consumption and business investment and
budget deficit reduction have been offset by strong agriculture production and continued expansion
in the construction sector. Earthquake related reconstruction is gathering pace.1 Weather helped
boost agricultural exports in 2012, while service exports were weighed down by the persistently
strong exchange rate, brought about in part by the easing of global monetary conditions and more
recently capital inflows related to a recovery in global risk appetite.
2.
Inflation. Inflation remains subdued, with the
exchange rate dampening tradable price inflation.
Wage pressures are contained and by a range of
measures the labor market remains soft. However
pressures have emerged in the housing market,
notably in Auckland where supply bottlenecks persist
and in Christchurch where construction cost inflation
has accelerated (figure). These two cities account for
more than half of the housing wealth in New Zealand.
Prices outside of these cities have been stable.
3.
Monetary policy. The Reserve Bank of New
Zealand (RBNZ) has kept the policy rate at 2½
percent for two years (figure) given uncertainty over
the global outlook, soft domestic demand, benign
inflationary expectations, and the strong New Zealand
dollar. Favorable offshore borrowing conditions have
reduced banks’ funding costs and contributed to a
further lowering of lending rates.

Fiscal developments. As a consequence of

the crisis and two large earthquakes, net government
debt grew from 5½ percent of GDP in 2008 to 20 percent in 2011. The government has since
established a medium term deficit reduction plan which would reduce the structural budget deficit
by about 6 percent of GDP over four years, mainly through spending restraint.

The overall cost of reconstruction from the 2010 and 2011 earthquakes is estimated at about 15 percent of GDP.
About one-half of the damage was to New Zealand’s housing stock, limiting the negative impact on economic
growth going forward. The public sector (the central government and Earthquake Commission) will finance around
one-third of the reconstruction, with the bulk of the remaining costs financed from abroad through reinsurance,
thereby buffering impact of the earthquake on New Zealand’s overall balance of payments.

External sector. The current account deficit in 2012 widened somewhat to 5 percent of
GDP, reflecting some terms of trade losses, although it is well below the 8 percent level in 2005-08.
Net external liabilities remain high at 72 percent of GDP at end-2012.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS

Near-term outlook. The growth forecast for this year, currently at 2¼ percent, is subject to
uncertainty. An increase in construction activity is

External risks. Although these risks have recently receded somewhat, potential weaknesses
in the global economy and a possible upheaval in the global financial system still pose risks to both
the current and the financial accounts.2 The main
channels are:




Declining export demand causing a worsening
of terms of trade. A global slowdown would hit
commodity prices and New Zealand’s terms of
trade, although in the past declines in
commodity prices have often been offset by a
weakening of the exchange rate (figure),
buffering the impact on the economy.

Increased cost of external funding and rollover
risks. Banks continue to rely heavily on
offshore wholesale funding and a worsening of global financial conditions would raise
funding costs.3 Moreover, some of banks’ total liabilities are short term external borrowings,
leaving them exposed to the tail risk of a temporary shutdown of global funding markets.
Banks are now less vulnerable than during the market disruption in late-2008, as the share of
retail deposits and the average maturity of bank liabilities have been steadily increasing over
the last two years and the source of funding is diversified across regions and products.
Overall, with banks taking advantage of the relative calm in global markets to pre-finance

their upcoming funding needs at relatively low borrowing rates, the likelihood and potential
impact of a shutdown in offshore funding markets has declined in recent months.
8.
Housing sector risks. Household credit growth, housing market turnover, and house price
inflation have all recently picked up, particularly in Auckland where supply bottlenecks persist, and
prices remain elevated by most measures of affordability.4 Recent developments also suggest some
easing of mortgage lending standards. In these circumstances there is an emerging risk that
sustained rapid price growth could give rise to expectations-driven, self-reinforcing demand
dynamics and price overshooting. A shock to household incomes or to borrowing costs could cause
a sudden price correction, reducing consumer confidence as a large share of wealth is in housing,
worsening banks’ balance sheets, and impacting overall economic activity. There are some
mitigating factors, with a declining ratio of household debt to disposable income and low
concentration of debt among low-income households likely limiting mortgage defaults and the
impact of house price declines on the banks’ balance sheets (figures).

Possible outward spillovers. Spillovers from potential problems in New Zealand are limited
by its small size but could potentially affect Australia. This is largely because of the Australian banks’
ownerships of most of the New Zealand banking system and the geographic and economic
similarities of the two economies—both are commodity exporters with a generously priced housing
sector involving significant bank exposures. However, these effects are mitigated by the fact that
their direct credit exposure to New Zealand is fairly limited and recent stress tests suggest that the
Australian banks are relatively resilient to external shocks.

mitigated by a number of factors including banks’
conservative lending practice and the high capital
requirement for mortgages. Prudential polices are in place
which could limit the likelihood that house prices accelerate

Tail risks and downside scenarios. Many of the above risks are closely linked, and the
importance of agricultural sector exports to New Zealand’s near-term outlook makes the country
vulnerable if a downside global scenario materializes. A combination of external shocks such as
international financial turmoil and a slowdown in China and Australia could trigger a sudden decline
in house and farm prices. This could in turn weaken consumer demand and negatively affect banks’

balance sheets and their willingness to lend. The downside macroeconomic impact in this scenario
where shocks compound each other could be large. 5
11.
Authorities’ views. The authorities shared staff’s assessment of the economic outlook and
risks. They noted that earthquake reconstruction would be a major driver of demand for many years
but the precise timing and size of spending is still uncertain. They anticipate that the drought will
have a sizeable negative effect on the growth outlook for this year. They are keenly aware that risks
in the housing market, particularly for Auckland, have increased over the last year. They noted that
the low level of residential construction activity in recent years has contributed to housing
shortages, and that these shortages are unlikely to ease soon. They also see the recent decline in
mortgage rates, reflecting banks’ lower funding costs, as contributing to demand. Adding to this,
credit has become easier to obtain, with banks competing aggressively to gain market share. The
RBNZ is watching for signs that perceived increases in household wealth will lead to lower
household saving, putting pressure on aggregate demand and increasing households’ vulnerability
to shocks such as increases in interest rates or unemployment.

NEAR-TERM MACROECONOMIC MANAGEMENT
12.
Monetary policy stance. Given below trend growth and low inflation, the current
accommodative monetary policy stance is appropriate. However, monetary policy is facing a
growing tension between maintaining inflation in the target band in a soft economy and preventing
an acceleration in house price inflation which could threaten financial stability. Going forward, the
stance may need to change if house price and credit expansion begin to fuel excessive consumption
spending and inflationary pressures. The RBNZ’s credibility and the effective monetary transmission
mechanism in New Zealand should allow for a nimble response should circumstances change.
13.
Fiscal Policy. The deficit reduction plan underway would achieve a budget surplus by 2015.
The 2013 deficit is expected to be about 2¾ percent of GDP.6 The plan relies mainly on expenditure
restraint by reprioritizing spending from lower-value to higher-value activities and reducing Budget
operating allowances; reducing the cost of existing policies; and driving efficiency gains. The
government designed an ambitious reform of many welfare programs to improve their efficiency
and reduce spending by almost 2½ percent of GDP in the next two years. The cuts in spending are
broad based with an almost 1 percent of GDP reduction in superannuation, social security and
welfare expenses, ¾ percent in health and 0.6 percent of GDP in education. Revenue is expected to
increase by almost ½ percent of GDP from 2013 to 2015. Under this plan, net debt would peak at
about 30 percent of GDP in 2015 and return to 20 percent of GDP by 2021. The government also
plans to sell stakes in several state-owned enterprises over the next four years amounting to about
3 percent of GDP and to use the proceeds to fund capital spending.
5

The challenge, not unique to New Zealand, in assessing the impact of an adverse scenario is that it is unlikely that
the risks identified would occur in isolation. Modeling tools aimed at identifying the impact of isolated, routine
shocks are not well suited for multiple simultaneous shocks. Given these limitations, the report instead focuses on
identifying where key vulnerabilities may lie, in this case through an assessment of how vulnerable banks are to a
well-specified set of shocks including house price declines (see paragraph 8 of Annex 1).

14.
Macroeconomic impact of fiscal policy. We regard the pace of deficit reduction as striking
the right balance between sustaining aggregate demand and limiting public debt growth. The
benefits of the plan are many. First, it withdraws fiscal stimulus at the right time by making room for
the expected increases in private sector and earthquake-related reconstruction spending. Second, it
has improved the macroeconomic policy mix by reducing pressure on monetary policy. Third, it
creates fiscal space to help the country deal with aging and health care costs that are expected to
increase over the long term and to cope with any negative shocks that may cause a sharp reduction
in domestic economic activity or potential liabilities associated with the banking sector. Last, it could
help raise national savings, reduce the current account deficit, and limit the increase in foreign
liabilities.
15.
Policy space to manage risks. The authorities have monetary and fiscal policy space to
respond to near-term shocks, with monetary policy serving as the first line of defense. The RBNZ has
scope to lower interest rates and loosen monetary conditions to help buffer against a downside
scenario. As evident during the global financial crisis, the free-floating New Zealand dollar provides
an additional cushion against external shocks, including disruptions to offshore funding and
negative terms of trade shocks, with widespread hedging by banks and businesses insulating their
balance sheets from fluctuations in the exchange rate. The authorities would be able to provide
emergency liquidity support to banks which proved effective when wholesale markets shut down in
the wake of the 2008 crisis. New Zealand’s modest public debt gives the authorities scope to delay
their planned deficit reduction path in the event of a sharp deterioration in the economic outlook.
To limit the risks in the housing market, the new macro-prudential tools under consideration
(discussed in paragraph 22) could improve the RBNZ’s ability to guard against a loosening of bank
lending standards that would contribute to an unsustainable acceleration in house price inflation.
These measures are untested, however, and there are questions about how effective they will be
given possibilities of evasion and arbitrage.
16.
Authorities’ views. The RBNZ regards the currently accommodative monetary stance as
consistent with keeping inflation in its targeted range of 1 to 3 percent. They agreed, however, that
their flat interest rate outlook would need to be revisited if a housing-related credit boom added to
underlying inflation pressures. To address housing risks, the RBNZ is currently consulting on a
potential increase in bank capital requirements against high loan-to-value lending, and expects that
the new macro-prudential policy framework could be used to increase resilience in the banking
system against a future housing downturn while having a moderating influence on credit expansion
to the housing sector. They also pointed to longer-term measures to address housing supply
constraints, which could play an important role in containing price pressures and increasing
affordability.

EXTERNAL STABILITY
17.
Current account. New Zealand’s persistently large current account deficits appear to reflect
structural savings – investment imbalances, with low household savings playing a key role (see
Annex 3). The deficit is expected to widen this year despite relatively strong terms of trade as

low savings, rather than being the task of shortterm macroeconomic management. The government’s Savings Working Group presented
recommendations in February 2011, suggesting raising national saving by 2–3 percent of GDP
primarily through an increase in public saving and tax policy changes. They include a further switch
from income to consumption taxation over the medium term while maintaining the broad base of
the GST, and indexing interest income and expenses at a standard rate for tax purposes that reflects
the rate of inflation. Budget deficit reduction would also contribute to this end, as would further
household balance sheet repair. In this regard much will depend on whether the post-crisis increase
in the household savings rate represents a structural break from past behavior.
18.
Exchange rate assessment. Aside from these structural factors, there are a number of
short-term factors contributing to the currently overvalued exchange rate, including a continuing
gap between domestic and foreign interest rates and more recently, increased portfolio flows into
New Zealand (Box 2). If global monetary conditions were to become less stimulatory, the exchange
rate would likely depreciate over time, reducing the current account deficit over the medium term—

Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed that the persistent strength of the New Zealand

dollar is mainly the result of structural savings – investment imbalances, and not short-term

Box 2. Exchange Rate Assessment 1/
New Zealand’s real effective exchange rate remains
elevated in 2012 despite some decline in commodity
prices, reflecting strengthening of the nominal effective
exchange rate. The relatively strong dollar continues to
weigh on tradable sector competitiveness and limit
demand for net exports. The current account deficit
widened from 4 percent of GDP in 2011 to 5 percent in
2012.
Aside from the structural savings-investment imbalance
that contributes to the persistently strong exchange rate
(see Annex 3), there are a number of short-term factors
associated with its current level, including the gap
between domestic and foreign interest rates, the recovery
in global risk appetite, and increased portfolio and official
flows into New Zealand.

A second approach suggests that stabilizing net external liabilities at the 2011 level of around 80 percent

GDP. Given the trade elasticities estimated by CGER, this would need the New Zealand dollar to be about
15 percent weaker than its current level.

monetary policy management. They recognize the long-standing risk posed by the country’s
relatively large external debt position, and view the planned increase in public savings as the most
effective policy action to reduce this risk. They noted the increase in household saving that had
occurred in the past few years but agreed that there was some uncertainty about how much of the
increase represented a structural shift. They emphasized the key role the integrity and credibility of
the RBNZ’s monetary policy framework, including the free floating exchange rate, has played in
delivering macroeconomic stability and enhancing the resilience of the New Zealand economy.
They agreed that part of the currency’s current strength may dissipate with eventual tightening by
major central banks, but underscored their concern that weak global growth and persistent
European financial turmoil could delay this tightening for some time, adding to future current
account deficits.

SAFEGUARDING FINANCIAL SECTOR STABILITY
20.
Financial developments. New Zealand’s banking sector has strengthened in the aftermath
of the global crisis (see Annex 1). Asset quality remains good, the ratio of nonperforming loans to
total assets is low and continues to decline from its peak, and return-on-assets is in line with the
pre-crisis average. Capital adequacy has improved and is well above the Basel III capital
requirements which the RBNZ began to put in place in January. Banks have shifted toward more
stable funding sources facilitated by a combination of strong deposit growth and slower credit
growth. Reliance on offshore wholesale funding has been reduced and is of longer maturity, and
deposits now meet around half of banks’

high. These are longstanding structural issues
that will remain sources of risk over the medium
term.
21.
Capital requirements. The RBNZ’s conservative risk weights, capital eligibility, and
deduction rules give New Zealand banks higher quality capital than their advanced country peers. At
the same time, banking sector vulnerabilities should be assessed on an ongoing basis to minimize
the risk that systemically important banks pose to the economy, taking into account the currently
evolving international standards.
22.
Revisions to the macro-prudential framework. The announcement of a number of macroprudential tools (available to use in circumstances such as periods of excessive credit growth) sends
12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NEW ZEALAND

a strong signal to the market of the authorities' intention to safeguard financial system stability. The
new tools are expected to include countercyclical capital buffers, overlays to sectoral capital
requirements, cyclical variation in the Core Funding Ratio, and loan-to-value restrictions. The
intention is to have the RBNZ apply these measures after consultation with the Minister of Finance,
and a memorandum of understanding outlining the process will be signed soon. The framework is
expected to be in place by the second half of the year. As noted in paragraph 15, these new
measures could help dampen credit cycles, strengthen macroeconomic management, and guard
against an acceleration of house price inflation.
23.
Financial sector resilience. Consistent with staff simulations, the authorities’ recent stress
tests, based on both single and combined shocks, show that the major banks would be able to
withstand a sizeable shock to output, terms of trade, commodity prices, rising unemployment, and a
fall in house, farm, and commercial property prices.7 However, a severe shock that combines an
adverse global scenario with sectoral downturns would make major inroads into these banks’ capital
buffers requiring recapitalization efforts. Banks would also likely require RBNZ help to withstand an
extreme funding shock.
24.
Authorities’ views. The authorities emphasized their conservative approach to bank
regulation and supervision. Given this together with New Zealand banks’ high capital quality, they
did not see a need at present to raise the minimum capital requirements for the four systemically
important banks above the Basel III requirements. The authorities agreed with staff that the new set
of macro-prudential tools should be viewed as a complement to and not substitute for
macroeconomic and micro-prudential measures. They stressed their intention to use these tools
judiciously, and as experience with such instruments is limited, with caution, with the primary
objective of limiting the periodic buildup of system-wide risk. Measures have been taken to further
strengthen the AML/CFT regime, particularly to ensure adequate transparency of legal persons and
arrangements.

STAFF APPRAISAL
25.
Outlook and risks. Growth this year is likely to remain modest, with an increase in
construction activity being offset by headwinds from budget deficit reduction, the strong dollar, and
the recent severe drought. Spare capacity and a soft labor market will contain inflation pressures in
the near term. Rising house prices, which are already elevated by standard metrics, are a growing
concern, as they could lead to an increase in debt-financed household spending which would put
pressure on aggregated demand, and increase the risk of an abrupt price correction. Other threats
include the financial and economic fallout from an intensification of European sovereign debt
problems and a slowdown in China, Australia, and other parts of Asia.

Annex 1 discusses the assumptions of the stress test exercise.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

26.
Monetary policy. The current accommodative monetary policy stance is appropriate, but
may need to change if house price and credit expansion begin to fuel excessive consumption
spending and inflationary pressures. The RBNZ’s credibility and the effective monetary transmission
mechanism in New Zealand should allow for a nimble response should circumstances change.
27.
Fiscal policy. The planned pace of deficit reduction strikes the right balance between
sustaining aggregate demand and limiting public debt growth. It withdraws fiscal stimulus at the
right time by making room for the expected increases in private sector and earthquake-related
reconstruction spending, it has improved the macroeconomic policy mix by reducing pressure on
monetary policy, it creates fiscal space to help deal with future spending pressures and cope with
any negative shocks, and could help raise national savings. New Zealand’s relatively modest public
debt gives the authorities some scope to delay their planned deficit reduction path in the event of a
sharp deterioration in the economic outlook.
28.
External vulnerabilities and the exchange rate. New Zealand’s large net liabilities are a
longstanding source of external risk, and reflect historically low household savings rates. Given a
structural savings-investment imbalance, reducing pressure on the exchange rate and limiting
current account deficits in a lasting way will require addressing the reasons for low savings, rather
than being the task of short-term macroeconomic management. Aside from these structural factors,
there are a number of short-term factors contributing to the currently overvalued exchange rate,
including a continuing gap between domestic and foreign interest rates and more recently,
increased portfolio flows into New Zealand. If global monetary conditions were to become less
stimulatory, the exchange rate would likely depreciate over time, reducing the current account
deficit over the medium term.
29.
Financial sector issues. Banks remain sound, and recent stress tests show that the major
banks would be able to withstand a sizeable shock to output, terms of trade, rising unemployment,
and a fall in property prices. The banks remain exposed, however, to highly leveraged households
and farmers and rollover risks associated with large short-term offshore funding needs. To limit the
risks in the housing market, the new macro-prudential tools under consideration could improve the
RBNZ’s ability to guard against a loosening of bank lending standards that would contribute to an
unsustainable acceleration in house price inflation. These tools should be viewed as a complement
to macroeconomic and micro-prudential measures. They should be used infrequently, and as
experience with such instruments is limited, with caution, with the primary objective of limiting the
periodic buildup of system-wide risk.

Sources: Data provided by the New Zealand authorities; and IMF staff estimates and projections.
1/ The large net errors and omissions in 2008 and 2009 mainly reflect financial account data issues, as extreme volatility i
exchange rates and market prices during that period made it difficult to separate out valuation effects from financial
account transaction.
2/ IIP balance sheet positions arise from transactions and valuation changes. The large net errors and omissions in 2008do not lead to large under-estimation of net foreign liabilities.

1/ The large net errors and omissions in 2008 and 2009 mainly reflect financial account data issues, as extreme volatility in
exchange rates and market prices during that period made it difficult to separate out valuation effects from financial
account transaction.
2/ IIP balance sheet positions arise from transactions and valuation changes. The large net errors and omissions in 2008-09
do not lead to large under-estimation of net foreign liabilities.

Annex 1. The Resilience of New Zealand's Banking Sector1
1.
The banking sector in New Zealand weathered the global financial crisis well and has
emerged in a stronger position and better placed to withstand another possible global
banking shock. This resilience was despite a number of pre-crisis structural vulnerabilities. These
included the limited deposit mobilization and a high reliance on short term foreign borrowing, and
the consequences of sustained credit expansion with high exposures to highly indebted household
and dairy sectors and a notable expansion in mortgage lending. The core institutions – the top four
banks that are subsidiaries of leading Australian banks – did not need to access on a sustained basis
the support mechanisms that were temporarily put in place by the government and the Reserve
Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) and they were unscathed by the shakeout of peripheral non bank
financial institutions (NBFIs) that occurred during the crisis.
2.
In response to the vulnerabilities that the crisis exposed, a number of steps have been
taken to improve banks’ resilience. Bank’s balance sheets are more resilient, and the regulatory
structure has been strengthened.
3.
The liability structure has improved with banks borrowing less in international
wholesale markets and at longer maturities. Conversely, the proportion of funding from the local
deposit base has increased (chart 1). The RBNZ has steadily tightened requirements regarding how
the banks are funded, requiring greater stability and reducing liquidity mismatches. Banks now have
a higher core funding ratio (CFR) than required by the RBNZ and than under similar Basel III
standards (chart 2). System-wide CFR—which includes customer deposits, longer-term wholesale
borrowing, and bank capital—rose from a little under 70 percent in October 2008 to 85 percent at
end 2012 as banks have taken advantage of relative calm in global financial markets and low rates
to prefund their current needs and have also started to use covered bonds to borrow at lower rates.
Banks are also fully compliant with the new requirements that the liquidity mismatch ratios should
not be less than zero (chart 3).
4.
The banks generally do not borrow directly from their parent institutions, limiting
direct contagion fears, but borrow in the international wholesale markets. Their borrowings in
the global wholesale markets are fully hedged against currency risk. About half of bank borrowings
are denominated in New Zealand dollars so there is no exchange rate risk. Of the remainder, hedges
are typically undertaken through exchange rate swaps with nonresident investors who have New
Zealand dollar denominated liabilities they would also like to hedge. These investors are mainly
globally systemic institutions and this limits counterparty risk. Credit risks are also minimized as
banks generally do not lend in foreign exchange and households do not typically borrow
internationally but via the domestic banks. Fonterra, the largest dairy exporter, also hedges export
proceeds, thus limiting the volatility in farmers’ incomes. This is important as loans to farmers
represent a significant share of the banks’ loan books.

5.
The quality of banks’ assets has improved. The relatively limited rise in non-performing
loans that peaked at around 2 percent in 2011 has reversed and the increase was low in
international terms (chart 4). Although the rate of credit growth fell during the global crisis, credit
growth still remained positive and banks are in stronger position to provide credit to support the
recovery (chart 5).
6.
Capital adequacy has remained strong by both historic and international standards and
banks already exceed the full Basel III requirements with a high proportion of equity capital. As a
buffer, banks are required to use conservative accounting guidelines that ensure higher risk weights
on potentially risky assets. Staff research suggests that if banks followed the more standard
approaches used by comparator countries, the capital adequacy ratio in New Zealand would be
about 100 to 200 basis points higher than presently measured.2 In addition, capital adequacy
dynamics are favorable as profitability has returned to the pre-crisis average, boosting own funds.
7.
The regulatory framework is being strengthened particularly to deal with the impact
of any future banking crisis. The top banks now conduct their mainstream operations through
subsidiaries rather than being branches of their Australian based parents and directors have a
fiduciary duty to safeguard the interest of New Zealand-based depositors. This limits the possibility
of funds being diverted in the unlikely case of problems at the parent bank. An Open Bank
Resolution framework is being introduced that aims to provide the government with an alternative
to a taxpayer bailout or liquidation, by maintaining access to a bank’s core transactional functions
while enabling losses to be borne by creditors, once shareholders’ funds have been extinguished.
The regulatory net has been widened to include deposit-taking NBFIs thus limiting contagion and
regulatory arbitrage possibilities and a number of stronger NBFIs have converted into banks
enhancing system-wide stability and efficiency by increasing competition.
8.
The relative robustness of the system to potential risks is validated by the results of
the recent stress tests, conducted in conjunction with the Australian Prudential Regulation
Authority (APRA). The stress tests applied a number of single factor tests and scenarios to model the
impact. The most severe scenario was based on an adverse international environment that impacted
the real economy and financial markets—a 40 percent fall in the world price of New Zealand’s
commodity exports, a six-month freeze on wholesale debt markets, a cumulative output loss of four
percent, a rise in unemployment to 11½ percent, and a fall in house, farm and commercial property
prices of about 30 percent. Estimates of default rates and loss given defaults (LGDs) were based on
detailed but standardized estimates for each type of loan provided by APRA—exposures at default
averaged 4 percent for the banks, with a range of 3.1 to 5 percent. Overall, impaired asset expenses
over the course of the three-year scenario rose to 5.5 percent of total loans. In this scenario capital
adequacy ratios fell sharply as banks reported losses (chart 6). Nevertheless, the test indicated that
2

For example, New Zealand’s four largest banks have an estimated weighted average risk weight on housing loans of
about 29 percent in 2011, compared with an estimated 17 percent for the four largest banks in Australia, 10 percent
in Canada, and 19 percent in the U.K. See New Zealand Banks’ Vulnerabilities and Capital Adequacy, Byung Kyoon
Jang and Masahiko Kataoka, 2013, IMF Working Paper WP/13/7.

banks complied with the minimum Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio that was in place at that time (at 4
percent)3, although two banks fall by 1 percentage point below the minimum total capital ratio of
8 percent. The RBNZ intends to conduct such tests on a more frequent basis and widen their scope
to include all domestic banks and to include a broader range of risks to the financial system.
9.
These tests indicated that the banks need to replenish capital buffers. This would need
to be done primarily through the raising of new capital as the scope for internally generated funds
would be limited by the inherently weak profitability in the recession. These findings and
conclusions were similar to stress tests undertaken by Fund staff. This analysis was based on a
substantial fall in asset quality, especially of residential mortgages similar to what was experienced
in Ireland. Under this scenario, the probability of default rose sharply and estimated losses were
larger than provisions Consequently, banks’ Tier 1 capital ratio fell by about 1 percentage point. A
test of the impact of corporate distress showed a similar result. Under a more severe scenario that
looked at combined shocks including adverse international developments, Tier 1 capital ratios fell
from over 10 percent to around 6 percent.

3

The Tier 1 capital ratio was raised to 6 percent in 2013.

Annex 2. Housing Market in New Zealand1
1.
House prices are high in New Zealand. Although affordability metrics are difficult to
interpret, most show a significant deterioration in the last two decades. The median house to
income ratio rose from 3 in 2000 to about 5 in 2007, before declining to about 4½ in the last five
years as incomes outpaced nominal house price growth.2 This ratio is somewhat higher than that of
several peer countries. Despite the recent decline, various measures still point to overvalued house
prices. Model based analysis suggests an overvaluation of about 25 percent.3 Price income ratios are
20 percent higher than the average of the last three decades. Price to rent ratios, which also rose
significantly during last boom, show an even larger overvaluation, although rent values in New
Zealand are distorted by the large stock of public housing, which serves about 5 percent of the
population.

From this high base, house prices are beginning to rise again, particularly in Auckland
and Christchurch. Real house prices post-2008 had been relatively stable until recent months, when
nation-wide annual house price inflation picked up to over 5 percent.4 Auckland has had price
increases of almost 12 percent for some months.5 The recent price pick up creates the risk of
speculative demand that could induce price overshooting. Supply response will take time, and
increased demand is likely to continue.

There are several underlying supply and demand pressures contributing to high and
rising house prices in New Zealand


Population growth and household formation



Low housing investment



Supply constraints



Low interest rates



High building costs

4.
Population growth and household formation. New Zealand has one of the highest rates
of growth for working age population among OECD countries—over the last 30 years New Zealand
has experienced population growth well above the OECD mean.6 Since 1971, population growth has
resulted in roughly 450,000 new households and the decrease in average household size has created
an additional 350,000. Between 2001 and 2006 an average of 22,000 additional households were
formed each year. Looking to the future, in nearly all parts of the country the average household
size is likely to continue to fall, implying increased housing demand. The government’s Productivity
Commission expects New Zealand’s population to continue to grow strongly. Much of this growth
will occur in the Auckland region, putting pressure on the regional housing market. It is currently
projecting a shortfall of 90,500 dwellings in Auckland alone over the next 20 years.
5.
Low housing investment. Housing investment fell sharply in the wake of the global crisis
and has been below 4 percent of GDP in the last five years, the lowest level in 40 years and relatively
low when compared to other countries. Meanwhile, net migration continued to be positive over
those years increasing demand.

6.
Low interest rates. Low inflation and high global liquidity has pushed mortgage interest
rates to their lowest level in 40 years. The fall in mortgage rates in recent years has helped offset the
effect of higher house prices on mortgage debt service, and has allowed households to take on
more debt despite already high debt-to-income ratios. Household mortgage service ratios are in
line with those in a set of comparator countries.
7.
Supply constraints in Auckland.7 Auckland has accounted for roughly 40 percent of New
Zealand’s net household formation over the last 10 years. This city is New Zealand’s largest city, with
about 1½ million people accounting for a third of the population of the country. It is projected that
there will be 200,000 more households by 2031, a 40 percent increase with respect to 2011.
Increasingly smaller households add to the increase in demand, as couples without children are
expected to increase by 55 percent and single person households by 67 percent.
8.
Regulatory constraints on supply. Additionally, supply of housing is constrained in
Auckland for regulatory reasons. Land availability is cited as a major constraint, with the price of
vacant land more than tripling in the last 10 years.8 The slow pace at which land for housing is
planned, zoned and released contributes to the high price of sections and thereby house prices. Also
compliance costs for development and construction are high and the associated delays are a
significant burden.9

9.
Supply constraints in Christchurch. The market of Christchurch, the second largest city
with a population of about 400,000 people, is undersupplied as a consequence of earthquakes that
damaged 150,000 houses, 30,000 of which seriously. The reconstruction cost of residential buildings
is estimated at 14.7 billion New Zealand dollars, or almost 7 percent of GDP. Reconstruction is under

way and projected to peak in the next three years, which should relieve pressure on house prices in
that city.
10.
Building costs.10 During the last construction boom, the cost of building a standard house
has increased at a greater rate than inflation adding upward pressure on prices. Currently, the cost
of both building materials and building a standard house is substantially higher than in Australia, a
comparable market. Industry productivity is flat-lining, and this is reflected in growing building costs
and evidence of poor building quality. Evidence suggests that the productivity performance of the
construction industry over the past thirty years has been poor relative to other New Zealand
industries, and relative to other countries. In particular, the lack of scale in the residential
construction industry presents a significant barrier to productivity growth.

Annex 3. Household Savings and the Current Account in New
Zealand1
1.
Overview. New Zealand has run persistent
current account deficits. It is not entirely clear why this
is the case, but it most likely reflects structurally low
household savings, possibly related to the structure of
New Zealand’s tax, social security, and welfare
systems. Meeting the country’s investment needs
given low savings has required capital inflows
motivated by higher domestic interest rates. The result
has been a strong exchange rate over an extended
number of years and a buildup of the country’s stock
of net external debt.

New Zealand’s current account deficit has

30 years. Net external debt has remained high at
around 70 percent of GDP, significantly higher than
New Zealand’s peers. Reflecting in part a relatively
small domestic deposit base associated with low
savings (discussed below), this debt mostly takes the
form of banks’ offshore wholesale borrowing.

This suggests New Zealand’s savings – investment imbalance can be thought of as an
enduring structural feature of the economy, shaped by other factors. Several caveats are in
order, some of which may prove important in New Zealand’s case. As in many cross-country panel
regressions, heterogeneity in the country sample can weaken the fit and increase the errors. Uniform
cross-country data on fundamentals is limited, and these regressions require imperfect empirical
proxies—public health spending, for example, may be a weak proxy for overall social insurance in
New Zealand’s case.
4.
Key to the imbalance is unusually low
household savings rates in New Zealand.3
Investment levels in New Zealand have been
comparable to those of its peers, public savings
rates have been relatively strong, and business
savings remain positive over much of the last three
decades.4 Moreover, until the 2008 global crisis, the
gap between New Zealand’s household savings rate
and those in other countries had widened. This
suggests understanding household savings would
be a good starting point for understanding the
persistence of current account deficits and strong
exchange rate.

There are uncertainties in measures of household savings in New Zealand, related to difficulties in distinguishing it
from business savings. Nevertheless, overall private saving is low.
4

Like New Zealand, Australia has historically faced unexplained structural savings – investment imbalances. In
contrast, household savings rates in Australia have been comparable to its peers, but investment has been unusually
high.
5

See Selected Issues Paper Chapter I of the 2011 IMF Article IV Staff Report. Staff estimation suggests that the 50
percent rise in household’s perceived net wealth in New Zealand from 1990 to 2009 is associated with a 5 percentage
point fall in the net private saving rate, controlling for public savings and terms of trade.

of the difference—if public health spending were as predicted by New Zealand’s characteristics, the

Observed fundamentals fail to explain fully this persistently low household savings

8.
Other less-quantitative factors may be at play. New Zealand has some unique structural
features which could play a role in reducing households’ incentive to save. As indicated in the
Savings Working Group Final Report2 and a recent paper by Brook at the Treasury3, New Zealand
stands out as being one of the only OECD countries where individuals do not have access to any
significantly tax-preferred saving vehicles other than property. New Zealand and Ireland are the only
two OECD countries that do not have a tier-2 pension scheme – a compulsory private saving
account or a mixture of defined benefit and defined contribution schemes and funding by social

security taxes. Previous staff analysis also points out that compared to some OECD countries, New
Zealand relied more heavily on direct taxes4, which may have had a role in reducing private savings.
9.
Some factors could increase national savings going forward. Overall, at this point notwell-understood structurally low household saving is likely a major reason for the persistently strong
exchange rate, current account deficits, and resulting stock of net external debt.5 But the return to
budget surplus should increase national savings. An incentivized retirement savings scheme,
KiwiSaver, was launched in 2007 with automatic enrollment for new employees, and based on the
past five years, future take-up is likely to be strong. A key question is whether the jump in the
household savings rate post-2008 – of the sort seen in various other similar countries – is a
structural break or whether rates will return to pre-crisis levels. Further household balance sheet
repair could face an offsetting force of rising house prices in the coming years.

Based on the IMF Fiscal Affairs Department’s Tax Revenue Structure database for 2003-2007.

5

Reddell of RBNZ argues that the persistent current account deficits (and high interest and exchange rate) could be
related to high housing investment needs associated with the markedly increased and relatively rapid rate of
population growth since around 1990. See his presentation at the March 2013 RBNZ Exchange Rate Policy Forum
(http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/research/workshops/Mar2013/programme.html).

Annex 4. New Zealand: Main Recommendations of the
2012 Article IV Consultation
Fund Recommendations

Policy Actions

Fiscal policy: Staff advised to implement the
current deficit reduction plan if the economic
recovery proceeds as expected. The planned
fiscal consolidation strikes the right balance
between the need to contain both public and
external debt while limiting any adverse impact
on growth. It would also relieve pressure on
monetary policy and thereby the exchange rate,
helping contain the current account deficit over
the medium term.

The 2012 Budget plans a return to surplus by
fiscal year 2015. The authorities reiterated
their commitment to this target. A plan of
fiscal deficit reduction is under way, mainly
through expenditure restraint and
reprioritization. In the last two years, concrete
expenditure measures been successful in
gradually reducing the deficit.
Also, the government is selling partial
ownership of certain state owned enterprises.

Monetary policy: Staff supported the
accommodative monetary stance. It
recommended that the RBNZ tighten gradually
to contain inflationary pressures if the recovery
remained on track and downside risks dissipate.

The RBNZ kept its policy rate unchanged at
2.5 percent given uncertainty over the global
outlook, soft domestic demand, benign
inflationary expectations and the strong
exchange rate.

Financial sector policy: Staff encouraged the
authorities to assess on an ongoing basis the
balance between banking sector vulnerability
versus efficiency to minimize the risk that
systemically important banks pose to the
economy. Staff recommended the future stress
tests to include funding risks and that the core
funding ratio be increased more than planned
over time. Also, staff suggested considering the
merits of raising bank capital gradually to levels
well above the Basel III requirements. Finally,
Staff encouraged the authorities in their analysis
of the cost and benefit of macroprudential
measures.

The authorities conducted stress tests in
coordination with the Australian authorities
which showed the relative robustness of the
financial sector. They included funding shocks,
among others.
Capital adequacy has improved and is well
above Basel III requirements which the RBNZ
began to put in place. Banks have shifted
toward more stable funding sources.
The authorities are revising the macroprudential framework. In addition to the
current floor on the core funding ratio new
tools will include countercyclical capital
buffers, overlays to sectoral capital
requirements, and loan-to-value restrictions.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. The authorities are continuing to enhance data quality
and expand the range of data available, including a project led by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand
to publish data consistent with the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual 2000 (MFSM 2000).
Given New Zealand’s high level of external indebtedness, the publication of up to date institutional
sector and flow of funds accounts would be an important addition to the current suite of statistics. It
is recommended that the authorities subscribe to the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation
with New Zealand
On May 13, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with New Zealand. 1
Background
Growth appears to have strengthened in the last months of 2012 and is estimated at 2½
percent for the year, as subdued household consumption and business investment and budget
deficit reduction have been offset by strong agriculture production and continued expansion in
the construction sector. Earthquake-related reconstruction is gathering pace.
Inflation remains subdued, with the exchange rate dampening tradable price inflation. Wage
pressures are contained and by a range of measures the labor market remains soft. However,
pressures have emerged in the housing market, notably in Auckland where supply bottlenecks
persist and in Christchurch where construction cost inflation has accelerated.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with

members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) has kept the policy rate at 2½ percent for two
years given uncertainty over the global outlook, soft domestic demand, benign inflationary
expectations, and the strong New Zealand dollar. Favorable offshore borrowing conditions
have reduced banks’ funding costs and contributed to a further lowering of lending rates.
Net government debt grew from 5½ percent of GDP in 2008 to 20 percent in 2011, as a
consequence of the policy response to the global financial crisis and the two earthquakes. The
government has since established a medium term deficit reduction plan that aims to reduce
the structural budget deficit by about 6 percent of GDP over four years, mainly through
spending restraint.
The current account deficit in 2012 widened somewhat to 5 percent of GDP, reflecting some
terms of trade losses, although it is well below the 8 percent level in 2005-08. Net external
liabilities remain high at 72 percent of GDP at end-2012.
The banking sector remains sound. Asset quality remains good, the ratio of nonperforming
loans to total assets is low and continues to decline from its peak, and return-on-assets is in
line with the pre-crisis average. Capital adequacy has improved and is well above the Basel III
capital requirements which the RBNZ began to put in place in January. Banks have shifted
toward more stable funding sources facilitated by a combination of strong deposit growth and
slower credit growth. Reliance on offshore wholesale funding has been reduced and is of
longer maturity, and deposits now meet around half of banks’ funding requirements. Banks’
balance sheets are fully hedged against exchange rate risk.
The growth forecast for this year, currently at 2¼ percent, is subject to uncertainty. An
increase in construction activity is offset by headwinds from budget deficit reduction, the strong
dollar, and the recent severe drought. Over the medium term, output growth should peak at
2¾-3 percent as reconstruction spending increases further before converging to a trend rate of
about 2½ percent. Underlying inflation is expected to increase but remain modest. Rising
house prices, which are already elevated by standard metrics, are a growing concern, as they
could lead to an increase in debt-financed household spending which would put pressure on
aggregated demand, and increase the risk of an abrupt price correction. Other threats include
the financial and economic fallout from an intensification of European sovereign debt problems
and a slowdown in China, Australia, and other parts of Asia.

3
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities’ strong track record of prudent macroeconomic
management in the wake of the global economic downturn and devastating earthquakes.
While a recovery is underway, growth this year is likely to remain modest, with an increase in
construction activity offset by headwinds from budget deficit reduction, the strong dollar, and
the recent severe drought. Risks arise from persistent low national savings and large external
liabilities, and from high and rising house prices. Directors welcomed the authorities’ continued
efforts to reduce these vulnerabilities.
Directors agreed that the current accommodative monetary policy stance is appropriate,
although a tightening may be warranted if house-price and credit expansion begin to fuel
inflationary pressures. They were reassured that the reserve bank’s credibility and the effective
monetary transmission mechanism would allow a smooth response to changing
circumstances. A few Directors pointed out that higher interest rates could lead to further
exchange rate appreciation.
Directors welcomed the medium-term consolidation plan and its focus on expenditure restraint.
The planned pace of deficit reduction strikes the right balance between sustaining aggregate
demand and limiting public debt growth. It withdraws fiscal stimulus at the right time by making
room for increases in reconstruction spending. It also reduces pressure on monetary policy,
creates fiscal space, and could help to raise national savings. Directors considered that the
relatively modest public debt provides some scope to delay the planned deficit reduction in the
event of a sharp deterioration in the economic outlook.
Directors noted that New Zealand’s large net liabilities reflect historically low household
savings rates and a structural savings-investment imbalance. They agreed that the causes of
low household savings will need to be addressed to reduce pressure on the exchange rate and
limit current account deficits. In this context, Directors welcomed the shift in the composition of
taxation from income to consumption taxes and looked forward to follow-up on the conclusions
of the Savings Working Group. Directors further observed that other factors contributing to the
overvalued exchange rate include a continuing gap between domestic and foreign interest
rates and increased portfolio flows.

4
Directors agreed that banks remain sound, with recent stress tests showing that the major
banks could withstand a variety of sizeable shocks. They observed, however, that banks
remain exposed to highly leveraged borrowers and to rollover risks associated with large
short-term offshore funding needs. Directors welcomed the reserve bank’s consideration of
using macroprudential tools in a judicious way to limit risks in the housing market, as a
complement to macroeconomic and microprudential measures.

Statement by Jong-won Yoon, Executive Director for New Zealand
and Leni Hunter, Senior Advisor
May 13, 2012
The New Zealand economy continues to recover, with stronger growth in recent
months. Expectations of further recovery are broadly in line with staff’s estimates and are
underpinned by accelerated construction activity and stronger household spending. The path
of fiscal consolidation, the elevated exchange rate and global economic conditions are also
important driving factors. New Zealand has also recently experienced a severe drought that
will weigh on farm output, and is currently estimated to detract 0.7 percentage points from
real GDP in calendar 2013.
The Canterbury earthquake reconstruction effort will provide a prolonged boost to
growth. Earthquakes affecting the Canterbury region at the end of 2010 and the start of 2011
caused severe damage and loss of life. Hundreds of thousands of homes were damaged, with
around ten thousand homes needing to be demolished. Rebuilding has been delayed by
persistent aftershocks which have numbered in the thousands, many of which have been
greater than magnitude 5. However, with reduced aftershocks and progress on insurance
settlements, rebuilding is set to accelerate in 2013. Reconstruction is expected to take at least
ten more years to complete, requiring investment spending in excess of 15 percent of GDP.
The current estimate of the cost to taxpayers from the earthquakes is around $15 billion. As
momentum around the rebuilding effort grows, the Government’s focus is on removing
roadblocks to ensuring the supply of workers and materials necessary to meet construction
demands.
Supply constraints, including reducing housing stock in Christchurch, and low interest
rates have led to resurgent house prices. House price growth has been particularly
pronounced in Auckland and Christchurch. For the March quarter, annual house price
inflation in Auckland and Canterbury was 13 percent and 10 percent respectively, with
growth across the country at 8.6 percent. While housing demand has increased, market
inventory is low and new supply remains limited given the slow pace of residential
investment. Although house price pressure is expected to ease with increased construction,
price escalation and renewed increases in private sector credit pose financial system risks.
Like staff, the authorities view house prices as already elevated relative to fundamental
metrics. A continuation of rapid increases in prices is likely to exacerbate the risk of a sharp
correction in future, increasing risks to financial stability.
Stronger activity is yet to result in improved labor market data. The unemployment rate
remains elevated at 6.9 percent, with firms displaying reluctance to take on additional
employees. While there have been encouraging signs from business surveys, these are not yet
suggestive of a strong near term recovery in employment growth.

2
The terms of trade have been supported by gains in dairy prices coupled with slower
increases in import prices. Prices of New Zealand’s export commodities have remained
strong and improved from mid-2012 lows, reflecting improving global conditions (especially
in Asia). In addition, slower growth in dairy supply and concerns about New Zealand’s
drought have supported dairy prices.
New Zealand remains sensitive to external developments, due to its small and open nature
and the long-standing saving-investment gap. New Zealand has run persistent current account
deficits, with high external debt high relative to GDP leaving the economy exposed,
including to a downturn in offshore markets. Given the structural nature of the issues, the
authorities consider a medium to long-term response as more appropriate than temporary or
short-term policies. The authorities have focused on reducing vulnerabilities and bolstering
economic resilience through deficit reduction, as well as structural reforms aimed at further
improving economic flexibility and competitiveness.
The elevated New Zealand dollar continues to act as a headwind to growth. The strong
New Zealand dollar in part reflects domestic data, and has some benefits for the economy
through lower inflation and support for capital goods investment, a large amount of which is
imported. However, the post-float highs in the currency are in excess of levels justified by
economic fundamentals, particularly given external imbalances noted above. With New
Zealand interest rates still quite high by international standards, stimulatory global monetary
policy and quantitative easing, aimed to support other advanced economies, have been key
factors behind the New Zealand dollar appreciation. Investor diversification – including from
official sources – is also playing a role.
Monetary policy
Monetary policy remains accommodative, with the policy interest rate held at 2.5 percent
since early 2011. Inflation expectations remain anchored and consistent with the Reserve
Bank’s medium-term inflation target band, although CPI inflation has hovered below the 1 to
3 percent band for two second consecutive quarters – with a CPI increase of 0.9 percent in
the year to December 2012. Both tradable and non-tradable inflation has been low – due
respectively to the exchange rate and spare capacity in the economy. However, non-tradable
inflation is expected to rise in line with increasing construction costs and a closing output
gap. Fiscal consolidation has provided some scope for monetary policy settings to remain
more accommodative than otherwise and has, at the margin, reduced pressure on the New
Zealand dollar.
The authorities currently expect to keep the Official Cash Rate unchanged through the
end of this year, and to eventually raise the OCR as the recovery progresses and pressures
on resources - particularly associated with the Christchurch rebuild - increase. If the
momentum in house price growth continues and adds to inflationary pressures, a monetary

3
policy response would become more likely. There are both upside and downside risks to the
outlook, but the authorities agree with staff that further reductions to the Official Cash Rate
(OCR) would be possible as a first line of defense to negative shocks. The floating exchange
rate would also act as a shock absorber. However the Reserve Bank has indicated that should
further strong appreciation for reasons unrelated to fundamentals be experienced, a lower
OCR may become warranted.
Fiscal policy
The Government is on track to return the operating balance to surplus in 2014/15, with
further increases in the surpluses thereafter. This will support an increase in national
savings and rebuild fiscal buffers. The government aims to reduce net core Crown debt to 20
percent of GDP by 2020, from an expected peak just below 30 percent. Figures released on
May 6 for the government’s fiscal deficit for the first 9 months of this year found the deficit 5
percent less than forecast, due to higher-than-expected tax receipts, and lower spending. The
2013 Budget will be delivered on 16 May.
Expenditure control is a key feature of the Government’s fiscal plans. Spending restraint
is being achieved in a number of ways, including: reprioritizing spending from lower-value
to higher-value activities; reducing Budget operating allowances, including two Budgets in
2011 and 2012 that featured net-zero increases in discretionary spending; reducing the cost of
existing policies; and driving efficiency gains from the public sector. Public sector capital
spending over the next four years will be funded from the Crown’s balance sheet and in
particular from the proceeds of Government’s share offer program. The asset sales reflect the
Government’s intent to more actively manage its assets to ensure the best returns and use of
public resources.
Structural reform
Government has actively pursued a number of reforms to improve New Zealand’s
productivity and competitiveness. Over the past four years personal income and company
tax rates have been lowered, while consumption tax and the effective tax on property
investment have been raised. Labor market reform has included introduction of a 90-day trial
period for new employees, and a “starting-out” youth minimum wage. Welfare system
reform that was announced in the Budget 2012 is being progressed, with additional funding
allocated to assist beneficiaries to return to work. Other reforms include changes to consent
processes under the Resource Management Act, and an infrastructure program to improve
roads, rail and broad-band access. In addition, Accident Compensation Corporation (accident
insurance) levies have been reduced to lower costs to households and firms.

4
Financial sector
Bank profits have returned to near pre-crisis levels, in terms of return on assets. Banks
have rebuilt interest margins, and have sought to grow lending. Competition for market share
combined with weak loan demand has involved some relaxation of lending standards. As
staff’s report notes, high LVR lending has formed a larger share of new mortgage lending
over recent times. Nevertheless, non-performing loans remain low at below 2 percent of
lending, though with some concentration of risk in rural and business lending sectors. The
authorities continue to closely monitor risks related to both residential mortgage and farm
lending, and have performed stress tests in collaboration with the Australian Prudential
Regulatory Authority.
New Zealand’s banks have continued to build their liquidity and capital buffers. The
banks increased their capital buffers in anticipation of the Basel III capital adequacy
standards, which took effect from 1 January 2013. The counter-cyclical capital buffer
framework will be available to be used from 1 January 2014. The Reserve Bank has also
consulted on higher capital adequacy requirements for higher LVR lending, for banks using
the internal models based approach, and announced increases in those requirements in its
Financial Stability Report released earlier this week. The banks are comfortably meeting
existing regulatory requirements for core funding, including the increase in the core funding
ratio that came into effect on 1 January 2013. Reliance on wholesale funding has been
reduced, with loan growth over the last couple of years matched by deposit growth from a
recovery in private savings.
Consultation has recently taken place on a new macro-prudential framework and
instruments, to assist the Reserve Bank to fulfill its legislative requirement to promote the
maintenance of a sound and efficient financial system. Instruments will include a
countercyclical capital buffer, and potentially adjustments to the core funding ratio, sectoral
capital requirements, and restrictions on high LVR lending. Macro-prudential tools will help
to manage risks associated with the credit cycle, including risks stemming from the recent
resurgence in house prices and private credit growth discussed above. The authorities are
realistic in their expectations of the efficacy of macro-prudential tools in attenuating the
cycle, and share staff’s view that the tools would be complementary to macroeconomic and
micro-prudential measures.
The RBNZ is implementing a new prudential regime for the insurance sector, and is
two-thirds of the way through the licensing of all insurers. All insurers are required to
have a full license by September 2013. The earthquake has had a strong impact on the
insurance industry, with the sector continuing to process claims. Claims of $13.4 billion have
been paid to date, out of an expected total claims cost well in excess of $30 billion. Insurers
are now rebuilding profitability, in part through rising premiums.

5
The RBNZ has continued consultation on its Open Bank Resolution (OBR) policy. OBR
aims to provide Government with scope to very quickly reopen a bank after a failure event
and an alternative option to a taxpayer bailout or liquidation. The resolution policy will
preposition banks to enable losses to be borne by unsecured creditors, including depositors,
once shareholders’ funds have been extinguished. In the event of a bank failure, depositors
will retain access to a non-frozen and government-guaranteed portion of their accounts, and
customers will retain access to their bank’s core transactional functions.
