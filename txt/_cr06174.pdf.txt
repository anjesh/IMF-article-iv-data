Arrangement. A three-year PRGF arrangement was approved on December 13, 2002, for an amount
equivalent to SDR 97.5 million (75 percent of the quota) and was set to expire in December 2005. On
September 8, 2004, the Executive Board concluded the fifth and sixth reviews with an associated
disbursement of SDR 13.93 million. However, the PRGF arrangement went off track in the latter part
of 2004 reflecting passage of a 2005 budget with large increases in public sector wages and stalled
structural reforms. The authorities have since taken significant measures to strengthen the
macroeconomic framework and reinvigorate the structural reform program. In December 2005, the
PRGF arrangement was extended through end-February 2006 to allow time for completion of prior
actions before the current request for completion of reviews and extension of the arrangement.

•

Article IV. The last Article IV consultation was concluded on December 4, 2002. At the time of the
previous consultation, directors expressed concern over the deterioration in Nicaragua’s economic
performance, but welcomed the new governments commitment to correct the economy’s key
vulnerabilities, including strengthening the financial sector and governance. They stressed the
importance of sustained fiscal consolidation and welcomed the focus of the monetary strategy on
building international reserves while maintaining low inflation. The delay in the consultation cycle
reflects the authorities’ desire to bring the PRGF arrangement back on track in the context of
completing the consultation.

•

Mission. The mission visited Managua during September 7–22, 2005, comprising Vikram Haksar
(head), Sergio Martin, Jordi Prat, Rita Babihuga (all WHD), Jean-François Dauphin (PDR), and
Alejandro Simone (FAD); and was assisted by Humberto Arbulú-Neira (resident representative). The
mission met with President Bolaños, Finance Minister Arana, Central Bank President Alonso, and
other senior officials, representatives of the National Assembly, civil society, and the private sector. A
follow-up mission to conclude the program discussions took place during November 15–22, 2005 and
spoke before the “National Dialogue” comprising key leaders of all political parties in Nicaragua.

•

Selected Issues Papers. The accompanying staff papers look at: (i) the implications of CAFTA-DR,
(ii) public sector wages, and (iii) the monetary framework.

•

Article VIII Obligations. Nicaragua has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4
of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on
the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
The authorities have sought to rebuild the domestic consensus for economic reforms in
the face of a difficult political environment. From late 2004, political tensions associated
with disputes between the legislative and executive branches arrested the reform agenda and
drove the program off track. In recent months, however, a political accord has fostered a
flurry of legislative activity on prior actions for the program as well as early passage of the
2006 budget.
The economy continued to perform well, notwithstanding pressure from higher oil
prices. Strong performance under the program in 2003–04 allowed Nicaragua to reach the
HIPC completion point in January 2004. Since then, growth has moderated towards
4.1 percent y/y in 2005 and inflation has picked up to over 10 percent y/y, as rising
international oil prices have been passed through to domestic fuel prices. High oil prices have
driven large losses in the power sector, although recently, electricity tariffs have been
adjusted. Strong export growth has allowed a modest rise in reserves, despite a higher oil
import bill. The 2005 budget included large public sector wage increases, an important factor
delaying completion of pending program reviews, but a tax package and spending controls
have helped to slightly reduce the consolidated public sector deficit to 2.2 percent of GDP.
Key medium-term challenges include addressing vulnerabilities arising from weak balance
sheets, reflected in high levels of debt and dollarization. It will also be crucial to strengthen
further the fiscal framework to safeguard poverty-reducing spending and improve the
business environment to leverage the potential of CAFTA-DR to support growth and
achievement of the MDGs.
Policy issues
Crucial structural reforms have been passed as prior actions for the program. These
include steps to strengthen the fiscal framework, including on decentralization and budget
control, as well as passage of three important financial sector laws embodying several FSAP
recommendations. The program for 2006 includes key additional structural commitments,
most importantly modifications to the recently approved tax code, which otherwise risks
weakening tax administration. The authorities also intend to develop strategies for advancing
plans for pension reform and fiscal responsibility legislation, for implementation after the
elections.
The 2006 budget remains tight in an election year. The CPS deficit is expected to remain
unchanged at 2.2 percent of GDP despite one-time election-related costs of about 1 percent
of GDP. Growth in the public sector wage bill has been contained broadly in line with
expected inflation. Electricity tariffs will continue to be adjusted to eliminate quasi-fiscal
losses in the sector.

-7-

Monetary policy will continue to be guided by the crawling peg exchange regime. The
central bank intends to take steps to slow down the growth of liquidity and credit to
safeguard reserves, contain demand pressures on inflation, and maintain stability in the runup to next year’s elections, which remain a key source of near-term uncertainty.

I. INTRODUCTION AND HISTORICAL CONTEXT
1.
The 2005 Article IV Consultation provides an important opportunity to take
stock of achievements under the authorities’ reform program and the challenges ahead.
Over the last years, the economy has grown in the context of a stable macro-framework.
Poverty reducing spending has increased and human development indicators have improved.
Nonetheless, Nicaragua remains the second-poorest country in Latin America. Half of the
population lives below the poverty line, with 15 percent living in extreme poverty. Still high
debt levels, large current account deficits and high levels of dollarization will require careful
macro management and concessional donor support over the medium term. The key focus
should be on policies that boost growth and poverty reduction, especially those that
encourage private investment, strengthen the fiscal framework, and protect the health of the
financial sector.
2.
Nicaragua experienced an economic collapse during the 1980s with recovery
over the 1990s. By the late 1980s, real per capita income had fallen to one-third of its level
of a decade earlier and the country had experienced hyperinflation. With the return of
democracy in 1990, and significant donor support in the context of successive Fund
programs, the economy began to recover (Figure 1). The economy has also increasingly
benefited from rising flows of workers’ remittances and FDI. The recovery has been
associated, however, with an economic structure highly dependent on foreign grants, helping
to finance large twin deficits. The latter part of the 1990s was marred by corruption, weak
fiscal policy, and an accommodative monetary policy. These problems culminated in a
banking crisis in 2000, which resulted in a jump in public debt of 20 percentage points of
GDP and a major loss of international reserves.
3.
In early 2002, the new Bolaños government implemented strong reforms. The
administration put in place a tax reform, streamlined expenditures, and strengthened
enforcement of prudential rules for banks. The government also took firm measures to
improve governance, including imprisoning former President Alemán (head of the Liberal
Party) on corruption charges. The authorities’ program was supported through a three-year
PRGF arrangement approved in December 2002. The program began to pay quick
dividends—in 2003 GDP growth recovered, inflation remained subdued, and NIR increased,
facilitating macro stability and some progress on structural reform.
4.
However, political tensions rose sharply from early 2004 contributing to an
environment that drove the program off track (Box 1). The escalation of latent tensions
between the executive and legislative branches of government stalled the structural reform
effort. The situation was compounded following approval of a 2005 budget that widened the
deficit relative to the executive’s proposal and included significant public sector wage
increases. Together, these developments delayed, for over a year, the completion of pending
program reviews under the PRGF arrangement after September 2004.
5.
A recent political accord between President Bolaños and the opposition political
parties has allowed re-starting the reform agenda, although risks remain. The key

Box 1. The Political Environment
The political situation deteriorated significantly in late 2004. This reflected a political “pact” in late
2004 between the two main parties (Liberal and Sandinista) to approve a set of constitutional
amendments aimed at curbing the power of the executive branch. President Bolaños rejected these
amendments, setting the stage for a constitutional crisis that put the President under threat of being
impeached and tested Nicaragua’s institutional stability. Moreover, the structural agenda stalled as
brokering a political truce proved to be elusive despite several rounds of negotiation.
In October 2005, however, Sandinista leader Ortega and President Bolaños reached a political
accord to postpone pursuit of the constitutional amendments until after the upcoming general elections
in November 2006. This accord, which has also drawn support from the Liberal party, in part reflects
pressures from the international community to advance reforms as well as a political consensus to revive
the program, including in the run-up to the MDRI. The political accord has made possible the approval
of a large number of economic reform laws that were pending as prior actions for completing reviews
and extending the PRGF arrangement.
The political outlook for the next year, however,

his candidacy and the Liberal party is to hold a primary

have emerged from within the two main parties,

responding to a high level of popular disenchantment
with their political “pact.” Indeed, recent surveys indicate that these breakaway candidates have large
leads in public opinion. However, it is unclear whether they will be able to build up a sufficiently strong
party organization to effectively contest the elections. As such, the outlook for the elections remains very
fluid at this stage.

political actors have agreed to defer controversial constitutional reforms—linked to the sharp
political tensions that derailed the program—until after the November 2006 presidential and
congressional elections. In a major step connected with this accord, the assembly approved
CAFTA–DR, which had previously been blocked by the opposition Sandinista party. Since
then, there has been a flurry of legislative activity on prior actions to put the program back on
track. Nonetheless, political uncertainty remains high, especially as the country enters the
run-up to the 2006 elections. This is a key factor driving the authorities’ desire to extend the
Fund-supported program to help provide an anchor for economic policies in the year ahead.
6.
In the context of completion of prior actions and strengthened macro-policies,
the authorities are requesting the completion of pending reviews and the extension of
the PRGF arrangement. In the attached letter to the Managing Director (Attachment I),
dated December 27, 2005, the authorities request: (i) waivers for the nonobservance of the

- 11 -

quantitative performance criterion (PC) on the overall balance after grants of the central
government at end-December 2004 and the structural performance criterion of submitting to
the National Assembly a fiscal responsibility law (FRL) by October 15, 2004; (ii) the eighth,
ninth and tenth disbursements under the arrangement, in the proposed rephased amount of
SDR 13.93 million; and (iii) the extension of the arrangement until December 12, 2006. The
authorities’ memorandum of economic and financial policies (MEFP) and a revised technical
memorandum of understanding (TMU) are also attached.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
7.
Macro developments in 2004 were generally favorable while performance under
the program was broadly satisfactory. Real GDP growth accelerated to 5.1 percent in 2004
on the back of a strong recovery in exports, higher commodity prices, and booming
remittances. Private sector credit expanded rapidly. Nicaragua reached the HIPC completion
point in January 2004, leading to delivery of external debt relief to date of about
US$4½ billion in NPV terms.1 The combined public sector (CPS) deficit in 2004 was
2.8 percent of GDP compared with the program target of 4 percent of GDP. Strong external
receipts, coupled with higher official financing, boosted NIR at end-2004 to US$128 million
over target. However, rising oil prices drove up end-2004 inflation to 9.3 percent. All but one
quantitative PCs were met in 2004.2 The authorities missed the structural PC on submitting
an FRL to the National Assembly by mid-October, as they were not able to form a domestic
consensus on this important reform in a period of mounting political tensions.
8.
Economic growth is projected to have
moderated to 4 percent in 2005 (Figure 2).
Reflecting the impact of higher oil prices and
weakening global demand, activity has slowed
across most sectors, though agriculture output has so
far held up. Export growth has also dropped off, in
part because of lower agro-exports, while public
investment has moderated reflecting delays in

At end-2004, the NPV of total recognized public debt was 120 percent of GDP. Assuming
full delivery of HIPC relief, including from non-Paris Club and commercial creditors, the
NPV of public debt would fall to about 70 percent of GDP. The implementation of the MDRI
would reduce it further to about 60 percent of GDP.
2

The authorities met all quantitative performance criteria (PCs) at end-June and endSeptember 2004. However, they missed the PC on the central government overall balance
after grants at end-December 2004 by a narrow margin, owing to higher-than-programmed
capital expenditure. All other PCs at end-December, including that on net international
reserves, were met by comfortable margins. No targets were set for 2005.

the back of strong growth in credit and remittances, while imports remain robust. Separately,
formal sector employment continues to rise.
9.
Inflation has picked up, reflecting in part
the oil shock, though core inflation has also
increased. CPI inflation rose to 10.3 percent y/y in
October, while both non-oil related inflation and core
inflation (excluding food and energy related prices)
increased steadily. The prices of oil related
components of CPI inflation, including oil,
electricity and transport have risen significantly, in
line with international petroleum prices.

The authorities have taken steps to strengthen the fiscal policy framework
following passage of the weakened 2005 budget (Figure 3). The executive’s proposal for
the 2005 budget targeted a 1.2 percentage point of GDP reduction in the CPS deficit relative
to the expected 2004 outcome of 4.0 percent of GDP. However, the budget approved by the
National Assembly implied instead an adjustment of only 0.6 percent of GDP, and included
an increase in the total wage bill of some 21 percent. In response to this, the authorities have
implemented revenue measures expected to yield about ½ percent of GDP on a full year basis
to offset the impact of the higher wage bill. This has supported continued strong revenue
growth this year, which also reflects some improvements in tax administration and a surge in
taxes on imports (Box 2).
11.
The CPS deficit is now expected to fall by more than ½ percent of GDP in 2005.
Buoyant revenues combined with higher-than-originally-budgeted foreign grants, have
facilitated approval of a revised central government budget consistent with a projected CPS
deficit of 2.2 percent of GDP in 2005 while also finding room to increase capital spending. In
this context, the deficit of the state electricity company is expected to rise as it is funding the
bulk of the power subsidy granted this year because of delays in tariff adjustments (see ¶12).
On the other hand, the CPS balance has been supported by the improved quasi-fiscal
performance of the central bank reflecting in part lower interest costs (as it has continued to
pay down expensive domestic debt and benefited from HIPC relief). In previous years,
capital outlays have typically been higher-than-expected in the last quarter. This year, the
authorities have required that foreign-financed project spending be tightly controlled by the
ministry of finance and therefore feel the scope for unexpected outlays has been considerably
lessened.
12.
Power sector losses increased sharply in 2005 as rates were not increased in line
with rising fuel input costs (Box 3). Electricity tariffs paid by consumers were not adjusted
during December 2003 through July 2005, creating losses at the electricity distributor, which
are estimated to have reached over 0.6 percent of GDP in 2005. The regulator granted a tariff
increase in July 2005, which was later stayed by the Supreme Court. Rolling blackouts
during September drove political support for a solution, resulting in the regulator granting

Box 2. Trends in Tax Revenue
Tax revenues have grown strongly in recent years, especially taxes on income and
imports. Tax revenues as a share of GDP have increased by more than 3½ percentage points
from 2001, reaching 16.9 percent of GDP by 2004. This reflects, in part, the impact of tax
policy measures taken by the authorities during 2002–04 that are estimated to have yielded
Contribution to Real Growth of Tax Revenues: 2002-05, Sept.
about one percent of GDP. Additional tax
17 (in percent)
measures in 2005 are expected to yield
about ½ percent of GDP on annual basis.
11
Furthermore, the tax base has grown
strongly, with imports rising at an average
yearly rate of 14½ percent in dollar terms

during 2004–2005. Moreover, the internal
tax administration (DGI) has been

As a result, the percentage of stop-filers at the national level LTU has declined to under

group declined to 1.3 percent.

Furthermore, the most dynamic taxes are
now on imports, but import growth is expected to slow to about 5–8 percent in the coming
years. Additionally, the looming elections pose an additional, if hard to quantify, risk. During
the last general election cycle in 2002, tax collections fell sharply (by over 1 percent of GDP),
partly due to a slowdown in economic activity, but also reflecting the difficulty of tax
enforcement in a politically charged environment.

Box 3. Electricity Sector in Nicaragua
Over December 2003–June 2005, electricity
tariffs were not increased in line with rising oil
input prices. Final tariffs are regulated and had
been reviewed (though not necessarily revised)
once a year. However, prices charged by generators
to the distribution company are market determined.
Political infighting had created a leadership
vacuum at the electricity regulator and tariffs had
last been revised in 2003. As a result, distribution
margins turned negative in late 2004 with rising oil
prices (most electricity generation uses oil as its
main input––hydro accounts for 20 percent of total
production).

As a result, losses in the sector increased sharply, requiring a policy response. A one-time subsidy
(0.6 percent of GDP) was granted in 2005 to the main private distributor to cover accumulated losses.
The authorities also began implementing a plan combining rate increases and targeted subsidies. Tariffs
increased by about 20 percent between July and December 2005. However, additional tariff increases,
estimated by the authorities at about 6½ percent, are required to eliminate quasi-fiscal losses in the
sector. The authorities plan to carry out this adjustment in increments by June 2006. In order to limit the
impact on the poor, there has been no increase in prices for consumers using less than 150 KWH per
month, about 75 percent of all consumers. This subsidy will be financed by the projected additional
value added tax revenues collected from charging some consumers higher tariffs. To stem future losses
in the sector, an Energy Stability Law approved in September 2005 authorizes the regulator to make
monthly tariff adjustments, on the basis of fluctuations in generation costs.
The energy sector will require significant new investment in the medium term. Power supply is not
reliable, while distribution losses and production costs are among the highest in Central America.
Nicaragua needs significant investment in reliable and low-cost generation capacity.

Reform of the regulatory framework is a sine qua non for attracting new investment and putting
the sector on a sound financial footing. As a first step, reforms of the ESL to eliminate distortionary
interventions will be needed. It will also be important to develop an independent regulator and introduce
a transparent, rules-based pricing framework that allows investors a reasonable rate of return. The IDB
and the World Bank are considering supporting further reforms in this area.

- 17 -

tariff increases adding up to about 20 percent through December 2005, with the scope to have
further tariff revisions granted under the new Energy Stability Law (ESL). The government
has financed the sector’s losses in 2005 through the central government budget (0.2 percent
of the GDP) and indirectly through ENEL, the state-owned power company (0.4 percent of
GDP), which condoned arrears accumulated by the distributor.
13.
Banking sector soundness indicators have improved, though credit has expanded
rapidly and risks remain from high levels of dollarization. Following recovery from the
financial crisis of 2000–01, the sector has become highly profitable with pre-tax returns to
average equity of about 35 percent in 2005. The non-performing loan ratio was 4.3 percent of
all loans in 2005 with reported capital adequacy ratios at just over 14 percent. Bank deposits
have grown strongly in recent years, supported by family remittances, though the pace has
moderated in recent months, likely reflecting the slower economic activity and falling
interest differentials. However, real credit has been growing rapidly at just under 20 percent
in the last year. Moreover, the banking system is highly dollarized, and while the open
foreign currency position does not appear large, underlying credit risk could be transformed
as well into currency risk (Box 4).
14.
The sharp increase in the oil bill in recent years has been only partially offset by
strong remittances and exports (Figure 4). The external current account balance had been
continuously strengthening since 1999, supported by gains in competitiveness, buoyant
remittance flows (which at 11 percent of GDP were higher than net official financing in
2004), and the post-completion point reduction in interest payments. However, exports and
remittances have slowed since early 2005, reflecting weaker U.S. growth, while rising world
oil prices put pressure on total imports. Indeed, the oil bill is projected to increase to almost
12½ percent of GDP in 2005, up from 6½ percent of GDP in 2002 (Box 5 discusses the
broader impact of elevated oil prices). As a result, the current account deficit is estimated to
have reached about 17 percent of GDP in 2005. Combined with delays in donor
disbursements (arising from political uncertainties and the stalled reform agenda), the
increase in net international reserves was projected to be held to US$15 million in 2005.
15.
Progress has been made on implementation of the PRSP. Since the adoption of
Nicaragua’s first PRSP in 2001, poverty reducing spending has increased from about
10 percent of GDP in 2002 to 13½ percent of GDP projected for 2005. The positive effects of
the PRSP implementation are reflected in improved indicators in the education and water
sectors, where PRSP-I targets on primary school enrollment and water coverage were
exceeded in 2003 and 2004. However, implementation of the PRSP-I has been more mixed in
the health sector where targets have not been achieved, and the coverage of vaccination
programs has been weak.

- 18 -

Box 4. Financial System Vulnerability
Nicaragua has one of the highest levels of
dollarization in Latin America. The
financial system is relatively small with
foreign currency denominated deposits
accounting for over 80 percent of total
deposits. The elevated level of dollarization
reflects continued low levels of policy
credibility as well as some hysteresis in the
aftermath of past high inflation episodes.

the risk of currency mismatches. Banks
generally maintain a balanced foreign currency book, with small net-open positions in some
months. However, a significant part of bank assets are held domestically in the form of dollar
denominated loans to the private sector and it is
unclear how much of this exposure is naturally
hedged. Consumer and commercial loans comprise
the largest share (28.5 and 26.8 percent
respectively). Indeed, credit growth has been
particularly brisk to the construction and real estate
sectors. Further, banks’ direct exposure to dollarlinked bonds issued by the public sector (including
the central bank) is also sizeable. Credit events
linked to large exchange rate movements could
transform this exposure into a sizeable currency
risk. Against this, banks are required to maintain
16¼ percent of their total foreign currency assets as reserves with the central bank. Available
data suggest that banks maintain additional foreign currency assets offshore with BIS reporting
banks.

Box 5. Impact of Higher Oil Prices on the Nicaraguan Economy
Nicaragua is a relatively energy intensive economy, including in comparison to other
countries in the region. The increase in international oil prices has therefore led to a reduction
in the rate of growth of output and to a near doubling in the oil bill since 2002.

One of the factors driving the large impact of the oil shock, relative to other countries in
the region, is the important role of oil-based generation in the total production of
electricity. Oil fuelled plants account for about 80 percent of total electricity produced in
Nicaragua.
Pass-through of higher oil prices to domestic gasoline prices has been complete. Domestic
gasoline prices are not regulated, and have moved broadly in line with US retail prices. This
has contributed to the pick-up in headline inflation, although non-oil inflation has also
increased, indicative of second round effects and possible demand pressures. However, the
increase in oil prices has not yet been completely passed through to final electricity prices,
which are regulated (see Box 3 on the power sector).

Higher oil prices have had a relatively large impact on growth and inflation in Nicaragua
compared to many other countries in Central America. This reflects the country’s relatively
high energy intensity of output and large oil import bill in 2005. Estimates of the impact of
higher oil prices on Central American countries prepared by WHD staff are shown in the
adjoining table. The analysis assesses the impact of higher baseline oil prices in 2005–06 (in
the October 2005 WEO relative to the May WEO exercise) on growth and inflation in the
region.

- 21 -

III. OUTLOOK AND VULNERABILITIES
16.
The near term outlook contains important risks. Growth in 2006 is expected to
moderate, reflecting the impact of higher oil prices and some slowdown in external demand.
Inflation remained elevated in 2005 and, while the path of oil prices remains a key
uncertainty, there is likely to be a need to tighten liquidity conditions to bring inflation down
further in 2006. Moreover, further electricity tariff increases in the pipeline will continue to
pressure headline inflation. Core inflation will likely continue rising in early 2006 before the
second-round effects of the oil shock start to wane. The fiscal outlook for 2006 will hinge on
expenditure restraint. Political uncertainty in the run-up to the November 2006 presidential
and legislative elections, and increases in election-related expenditures remain key risks.
17.
Important vulnerabilities arise

Medium-term prospects hinge on measures to boost investment and productivity
while reducing large existing imbalances. Reducing imbalances on a sustained basis will
require continued fiscal consolidation and structural reforms aimed at boosting economic
growth. Political uncertainty and an unstable regulatory environment are proving obstacles to
investment, growth, and poverty reduction. Strengthening the investment climate and
competitiveness will be crucial for boosting growth, as will taking full advantage of the
opportunities offered by CAFTA–DR .3 Nicaragua’s external competitiveness has improved
in recent years (Box 6), but the need to ensure further improvements as a result of

Issues related to the implications of CAFTA–DR for Nicaragua are discussed in Chapter 1
of the accompanying Selected Issues Papers. CAFTA-DR is expected to enhance the growth
performance of the whole Central American region including Nicaragua. The main effects
are likely to be a rapid increase in trade flows with the United States, increased product
diversification in the traded sector, a pickup in FDI inflows, and reduced macroeconomic
volatility. Of all the signatory countries, Nicaragua is expected to face the smallest fiscal
impact, mainly owing to a favorable schedule of tariff reductions negotiated with the United
States.

Box 6. Competitiveness and Business Environment
Nicaragua’s external competitiveness has improved in recent years, but gains remain fragile.
The real exchange rate (REER) has depreciated since 2001, while the tradable sector has grown
quickly (reflecting both manufacturing and commodity exports), driving a reduction in the current
account deficit. Nevertheless, debt-creating external financing was still equivalent to about 8 percent
of GDP in 2004. Moreover, the REER has been flat in recent months, and the non-oil trade balance is
expected to deteriorate slightly in 2005.

Nicaragua’s appears to be in a strong competitive position with regards to other CAFTA-DR
countries. Nicaragua has enjoyed the strongest rate of growth of the maquila sector in the region,
indicating the investors’ relative preference for that country. Similarly, Nicaragua has been the only
country in the region to broadly maintain market share in the US in competition with Chinese exports,
including in textile products.

productivity growth highlights the importance of wage restraint going forward, especially in
the public sector.
19.
The authorities have prepared a revised poverty reduction strategy that reasserts their focus on achievement of the millennium development goals (MDGs). The
revised PRSP-II builds on the PRSP-I, with key objectives including poverty reduction and
achievement of the MDG’s through economic growth, employment generation, increased
investment and export promotion. Additional strategic areas emphasized in the PRSP-II
include, human capital development and social protection, infrastructure development,
good governance and state reforms. Implementation of the strategy laid out in the PRSP-II
will remain a key challenge and it will be important to identify clearly the risks to the
strategy to help mobilize domestic support for the agenda. Moreover, it will be important to
discuss in the PRSP-II progress report how resources from MDRI debt relief would be used.
At this point, achievement of the MDGs remains some way off (Table 15). In this context, a
key concern is the need for further reforms of the fiscal framework to preserve the space for
increasing investment to achieve the MDGs.
20.
The staff’s medium–term baseline scenario assumes that strong reforms will
support growth and poverty reduction. Continuing fiscal reforms and sound
macroeconomic policies should facilitate higher productivity of public investment and fiscal
consolidation (especially reducing domestic debt). Meanwhile successful regional integration
could drive greater FDI and strong growth of the tradable sector, coupled with higher
remittances, gradually reducing the need for additional foreign savings and grants. All told,
these would facilitate higher growth and poverty reduction with a gradual reduction of
imbalances. The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) prepared by the staff (Appendix V)
shows that the level of both external and domestic debt would continue to fall gradually over
the medium term in the baseline, even under most shock scenarios. Gross financing
requirements are expected to remain manageable and allow a gradual reduction in
Nicaragua’s dependence on development assistance.4 Nonetheless, debt levels would remain
close to key vulnerability thresholds for several years, underscoring the need for steadfast
adherence to a prudent macroeconomic consolidation program.
However, in a weak policy alternative scenario, imbalances would increase
21.
(Figure 5). FDI, export and productivity growth would stagnate and maintaining monetary
control would grow increasingly difficult. Growing rigidities in public expenditures would
weaken fiscal performance driving debt levels up. Given constraints on external commercial
borrowing, as well as some likely diminution of aid flows in such a scenario, the bulk of
4

The DSA also includes a scenario factoring in the impact of the Multilateral Debt
Reduction Initiative. Nicaragua’s debt to the Fund and World Bank that would be subject to
reduction amounts to about 8 percent of GDP in NPV terms (¼ of external debt in NPV
terms). Debt service on these obligations is projected at US$15 million in 2006.

- 25 -

these increased imbalances would need to be financed domestically. This would drive up
interest rates and the level of domestic debt, crowding out private investment and further
reducing potential output growth. Viewed in the context of the LIC–DSA exercise
(Appendix V), debt levels remain very sensitive to shocks to key underlying macro
parameters.
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS AND PROGRAM FOR 2006
A. Fiscal Policy

22.
The fiscal strategy of the PRGF supported program has focused on bringing
down debt levels while creating room for poverty reducing spending. Key elements have
included boosting revenues, reducing non-development expenditures, and strengthening the
institutional framework. The medium-term framework targets about a 1½ percentage point of
GDP reduction in the CPS deficit (after grants) to 0.6 percent of GDP during 2005–10, with
gradually paced adjustment made possible by the continued availability of high levels of
grants and other concessional finance. Achieving this adjustment will require continued
public wage restraint, achievement of fiscal savings from effective decentralization, and
continued efforts to strengthen tax administration. Debt levels would continue to decline,
particularly for domestic debt, and debt service levels remain manageable, especially
reflecting the high level of concessionality and debt relief.
23.
The budget for 2006 approved by the assembly targets an underlying fiscal
adjustment in the election year. The budget targets an unchanged central government
deficit after grants, projected to be 1.7 percent of GDP in both 2005 and 2006. However, the
2006 budget includes one-time expenditures of 0.9 percent of GDP for administering the
2006 elections as well as constitutionally mandated transfers to political parties for campaign
financing. As such, the budget implies an underlying fiscal adjustment, including planned
permanent savings of ½ percent of GDP from the reduction of capital spending on
municipalities. The CPS deficit is projected to be 2.2 percent of GDP in both 2005 and 2006.
The programmed fiscal stance will be an important support for maintaining a stable financial
framework in the election year and provide cover against possible expenditure risks. Looking
ahead, the need for continued underlying adjustment is underscored by the still high public
debt levels, which are expected to skirt close to the LIC-DSA’s risk thresholds for the next
several years (even including additional debt relief from the MDRI).
24.
The room for development spending is constrained by large mandatory transfers
and the high election costs. Revenues in 2006 are projected to stay unchanged as a share of
GDP, with upside potential reflecting the strong performance in 2005 offset by downside
uncertainties on tax administration arising in the run-up to the elections. To stay within the

repeated in 2006. However, the high electionrelated costs and growing size of other constitutionally mandated transfers have squeezed the
budget.5 Overall, the authorities believe that poverty-reducing spending in the 2006 budget
will remain broadly unchanged relative to 2005 at about 12½ percent of GDP.
25.
Public sector wages have grown rapidly in recent years. The wage bill, broadly
defined, is now approaching as much as 8½ percent of GDP, at the high end of the
distribution for Latin America. 6 Available data suggest that public wages have risen well
above private wages in real terms and there is a concern that continuation of this trend risks
setting off a wage-price spiral and undermining competitiveness. In this context, rapid
growth in the 2005 budgetary wage bill was a key issue delaying completion of the program
review. Looking ahead, the mission stressed that ensuring that the wage bill rises no more
than anticipated inflation would be crucial, and worked with the authorities to develop a
measure of the central government wage bill that could be monitored and controlled as a new
performance criterion under the program (MEFP ¶5).7
The authorities are seeking to contain growth of the public sector wage bill in
26.
line with expected inflation. Depending on the definition used, the wage bill in the budget
proposed by the authorities was estimated to rise between 0.3–1.1 percent y/y in real terms as
compared with the staff’s recommended target of zero real growth.8 On top of this, higher
5

Earmarked transfers to universities and the judiciary are set to grow by 0.3 percentage
points of GDP in 2006 relative to the previous year.
6

Chapter 2 of the accompanying Selected Issues Papers discusses issues regarding public
sector wages, including how these compare with the private sector.
7

Finding ways to measure the broader budgetary wage bill to be monitored under the
program was a key topic for discussion with the authorities as spending on compensation of
employees is much larger than wages and salaries reported in the economic classification of
the budget (the latter accounted for about 4 percent of GDP in 2005).
8

A broad definition of public sector wage expenditures that can be identified ex ante in the
budget would rise by 0.1 percent y/y in real terms. A narrower definition of the wage bill that
(continued)

- 28 -

spending proposed by the assembly would have increased wage bill growth to about
1.8–2.8 percent y/y in real terms. Accordingly, the authorities took measures to bring the real
wage bill growth implied by the budget passed by the assembly back down between
0.1–0.9 percent y/y. Corrective actions to keep the wage bill in check taken by the authorities
include: (i) lowering compensation growth and eliminating vacancies in a number of
government agencies; (ii) lowering wage payments to consultants under donor-funded
projects (recorded under capital expenditures), and (iii) closing the defunct pension
supervisory body. The mission cautioned with regards to cutting foreign funded consultants
without careful study and coordination with donors. The authorities noted that there were
large and well-known inefficiencies in this spending, which were, moreover, loan financed––
World Bank staff concurred with this assessment.
27.
Electricity tariffs were increased by a cumulative 20 percent in 2005, completing
a key prior action for the program. In the absence of rate adjustments, quasi-fiscal losses
had been estimated to reach at least 1 percent of GDP. The authorities want to minimize the
social impact by gradually phasing in further rate increases. While clearly needed, their exact
magnitude will depend on movements in international oil prices and other factors. The
energy regulator has estimated that with present international prices, additional rate increases
of 6½ percent during January–June 2006, should eliminate quasi-fiscal losses in the sector.
The authorities have agreed to increase rates as needed by mid-2006 to eliminate losses, and
the regulator will introduce an automatic adjustment mechanism in mid-2006 once the
current round of rate adjustments has been completed.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy

28.
The case for tightening monetary policy was discussed in the context of high
inflation and strong credit growth. There was agreement that supply shocks were
important drivers of both headline and core inflation. However, staff expressed a concern that
rising core inflation also reflected second-round effects and demand pressures including from
the impact of the public wage hikes and high credit growth. The authorities explained recent
rapid credit growth in part as reflecting base effects after the banking crisis in 2000–01 that
led to steep falls in credit during 2002–03, as well as normal financial deepening. The staff
noted that real base money growth has been brisk while real lending rates and dollar interest
differentials have fallen with credit now higher than pre-banking crisis levels, and in line
with other Latin American countries.
29.
The authorities intend to tighten liquidity conditions. While the independence of
monetary policy is constrained by the crawling peg exchange rate, there is some scope for the
can be monitored ex post and controlled for the program performance criterion (accounting
for about 90 percent of the wider budgetary wage bill) would rise by 0.9 percent y/y in real
terms. Further discussion of wage bill definitions is presented in Chapter 2 of the
accompanying Selected Issues Paper.

substantial monetary measures has been
reduced by the supportive fiscal policy stance, which allows for a reduction in central bank
credit to the government. For 2006, the program targets an increase in adjusted NIR of the
central bank of US$85 million, facilitated in part by substantial expected donor financing.

30.
The authorities have decided to keep the rate of crawl of the exchange rate peg
unchanged at 5 percent in 2006. In recent years, the

authorities have gradually slowed the rate of crawl to

The authorities and staff discussed the pre31.
conditions for moving to a more flexible exchange regime over the medium term. There
was agreement that the crawl has served well to anchor inflation expectations, but the staff
noted that it reduces flexibility in dealing with unanticipated shocks, with vulnerabilities
heightened in the context of a highly dollarized small open economy. The authorities and
staff agreed that strengthening the regulatory framework and improving balance sheets
(public and financial sectors), and better developing open market operations, will be among

The central bank’s options for tightening liquidity to banks are constrained by several
factors, including the fact that most credit is dollar denominated. The mission discussed
alternatives including increasing reserve requirements on both cordoba and dollar deposits
(the latter could discourage dollarization of the banking system). However, the authorities
and the mission were concerned about the distortionary impact of increasing reserve
requirements and thus opted on balance to focus on open market operations.

- 30 -

the preconditions for eventually moving to a more flexible exchange rate regime.10 Building
on recent important financial sector reforms (¶39) will be crucial to facilitate this transition.
C. Structural Agenda
Structural Fiscal Reforms

32.
Introducing a credible fiscal responsibility law (FRL) is a key post-election goal,
and developing a road-map for moving in this direction is crucial.11 Approval of an FRL,
a performance criterion under the program, was set aside in the past year given concerns over
constitutionality and risks that such legislation would be weakened in the current political
environment. Accordingly, the program sets as a performance criterion the development of a
detailed road-map (MEFP ¶13) on introducing an FRL, for consideration by the new
government after the elections, including pre-conditions such as: (i) bringing extra-budgetary
entities on-budget; (ii) setting spending ceilings early on in the budget process; and
(iii) removing automatic transfers. The road-map will address whether these proposals will
require amendments to the constitution and is to be prepared by a high-level group
comprising representatives from the Ministry of Finance, Central Bank, and the Economic
Commission of the National Assembly.
33.
A number of related reforms to strengthen the budgetary process and
framework have been passed in the context of the financial administration law (FAL).
Pending additional steps towards an FRL, the authorities have moved ahead with the FAL as
a prior action for the program. The law was passed in July 2005. As advised by Fund staff,
the law provided for: (i) transfer to the ministry of finance of full control of the capital
budget, greatly strengthening control over budget execution, and (ii) approval of all
budgetary expenditures by the assembly (including any financed with concessional
resources), thus increasing accountability. The law also requires sending budgets for all
decentralized agencies to the assembly for information, though not for approval (deemed
unconstitutional). However, the law also left the assembly free to increase spending if
financing can be identified, and to change the composition of expenditures. Given
constitutionality concerns, and pending a definitive resolution of this concern in the context
of an FRL, the authorities further strengthened the FAL in November to set-up a consensusbuilding commission (with representation from the ministry of finance and the assembly),
that will assess, inter alia, the realism of financing sources proposed by the assembly before
the budget is approved.

10
11

Chapter 3 of the Selected Issues Paper reviews the current monetary framework.

An FRL would include fiscal rules for all levels of government, explicit transparency
requirements to underpin the credibility of such rules, a comprehensive coverage of debt, and
provide for an independent agency to monitor and enforce the framework.

- 31 -

34.
The authorities are trying to achieve effective decentralization. The program
called for an incremental devolution of expenditure responsibilities equivalent to one-third of
the government’s revenue transfers to municipalities per annum, starting in 2005, such that
by 2007 full fiscal neutrality would be achieved. However, devolution has been difficult,
reflecting in part technical difficulties in matching devolved revenues and expenditures
across municipalities as well as problems with the current legal framework. In this context,
the President has issued a decree that aims to eliminate central government spending in areas
that are considered the responsibility of municipalities, fulfilling a prior action for the
program discussed in coordination with the World Bank (MEFP ¶11). In line with the decree,
the 2006 budget cuts capital spending geared to municipalities by ½ percent of GDP with
respect to 2005. These measures would devolve expenditures equivalent to more than ½ of
revenues transferred to municipalities in 2006.
35.
Achieving full decentralization will require revising the legal framework. In a
first step, and another prior action for proceeding with the program, the assembly has passed
a law delaying further increases in transfers to municipalities (they will now be increased
from 7 to 10 percent of total revenues in 2010, not 2007). This will alleviate spending
pressures when preparing the 2007 budget and allow time for further reform of the
framework. The authorities noted that as part of the recent political accord, a broader
agreement has been reached to change the laws underpinning the decentralization framework,
to devolve clearly spending responsibilities to municipalities. As such, amendments to these
laws would be submitted to the assembly by June 2006 (a benchmark in the MEFP, ¶10). In
reforming the framework, it will be important to link explicitly the revenue transfers to
municipalities embodied in the Municipal Transfers Law, with the devolution of spending
responsibilities that should be more clearly defined in the Law on Municipalities. Moreover,
effort will be required to resolve the technical difficulties in terms of matching revenues with
decentralized expenditures. The mission stressed the importance of close collaboration with
Fund and World Bank staff to ensure that the proposed reforms are in line with international
best practices.
36.
The recently approved tax code has significant weaknesses that undermine the
tax administration, raising risks for tax collection, and needs to be strengthened.
Introducing a tax code to strengthen tax administration, in line with international best
practices, has been a key policy priority and was a program benchmark for October 2004. By
contrast, the version of the tax code approved in October 2005 (and going into effect in April
2006) introduces significant weaknesses that need to be addressed urgently, including on the
ability of the tax administration to collect information, conduct audits, as well as enforce its
decisions. Moreover, the code includes an overly broad release of liability for tax payers who
use authorized third parties (such as accountants) to prepare their returns and also gives the
tax administration discretion to waive and reduce fines. These weaknesses risk undermining
tax collection, even in the near term. The authorities indicated that they share these concerns
and are in the process of preparing amendments to the law, which are being discussed with
the private sector and political parties. Reflecting the authorities’ request for more time to
iron out remaining substantive issues on the amendments and build political consensus on the

- 32 -

measure, the program includes passage of these amendments as an end-March 2006
performance criterion (MEFP ¶15).
37.
The authorities intend to prepare a reform strategy that puts the public pension
system on a sound financial footing, without relying on government subsidies. The
pension system is actuarially insolvent, though its cash-flow position is not expected to
deteriorate sharply over the next decade or so. A previous reform aimed at transiting to a
funded pension system, but this plan was dropped when a re-assessment indicated that the
transition costs would be prohibitively high. Following this, the assembly approved a social
security law, subsequently vetoed by the President that essentially increased benefits without
raising contributions in addition to weakening the system’s governance structure. In the
event, implementation of this law has been deferred until after the election as a prior action
for the program, and next steps will be considered by the new government. Accordingly, the
authorities have indicated their commitment, as a performance criterion (MEFP ¶14), to
prepare a specific recommendation for reform of the system. The plan would build on the
work of the previous presidential commission that examined options in this area, and be
prepared by mid-2006. However, implementation will be left for the new government to
avoid any possible dilution in an electoral environment.
Other structural reforms

38.
Reforming the recently approved Energy Stability Law (ESL) will be crucial for
attracting needed new investment into the sector. The authorities noted that ESL was
approved quickly during a period of crisis in the sector (power blackouts were ongoing when
the law was passed). While the law introduces an important change in allowing for monthly
adjustments in tariffs (previously these could be changed only annually), and tougher actions
against power theft, it also introduces distortionary interventions. In particular, it caps
electricity spot market prices as defined mark-up’s over long-run contract prices, disrupting
the price signal in the market and reducing incentives for peak-power producers to enter into
the market. Further, the law includes provisions for potentially capping retail gasoline prices
and levying a fine on excess profits by distributors, which would be used to provide subsidies
and set up a “transport fund.” The authorities note there are failures in these markets, but
agreed that they could be addressed through regulation as opposed to in the law.
Accordingly, the program includes an August 2006 structural performance criterion (MEFP
¶16) on approval of legislation by the assembly eliminating these distortionary elements of
the ESL, allowing time for consultation, including with the IADB and the World Bank, on
how to proceed with further reforms.
39.
Significant strides have been made with advancing financial sector reforms in
line with key FSAP recommendations. As prior actions for the program, the authorities
have successfully sought passage of, and subsequent amendments to, three crucial financial
sector laws. These laws embody core FSAP recommendations such as incorporating
predetermined triggers for the application of corrective measures when a bank's capital ratio
falls below a certain level. Further, the independence of the bank superintendency has been
strengthened by removing all politically connected persons from its Board of Directors

- 33 -

(including the Minister of Finance). Moreover, the superintendency law has clarified that any
judicial action against the assets of intervened banks should be stayed until the intervention
process is completed. The approved Deposit Insurance Law (FOGADE) codifies the role and
procedures for FOGADE including in the context of bank intervention. Also, regulations for
consolidated supervision have been issued which strengthen the “ring-fencing” of operations
of local banks involved in cross border activities. The staff welcomed these developments but
cautioned that developing the implementing rules and regulations of the recently approved
laws will be crucial to ensure their effectiveness and that further strengthening of the legal
framework will be needed following successful initial implementation of the laws.
40.
However, some important FSAP recommendations will remain on the reform
agenda. The Nicaraguan authorities, as is the case with many others in the region, have not
been able to substantially strengthen legal protections for supervisors. Moreover, it will be
important to increase the role of the superintendency in the surveillance of major acquisitions
of financial institutions, and strengthen further regulations on “fit and proper” tests. Other
recommendations on recapitalizing the central bank, strengthening the framework for
monetary operations and on judicial reform have yet to progress. In this regard, the
authorities have agreed to prepare an action plan, for consideration by the next government,
on the next steps for implementing FSAP recommendations (MEFP ¶18). Nicaragua's
AML/CFT framework was assessed in September 2004 and several weaknesses identified
including with regards to criminalization of activities as well as a weak regulatory framework
for the financial sector. The latter concern has been eased somewhat in principle, reflecting
the revamped regulatory framework. However, additional steps are needed including action
to pass the Anti-Drug law and the Anti-Terrorism Law.
V. PROGRAM MODALITIES AND RISKS

41.
It is proposed to maintain the level
of access unchanged under the PRGF
arrangement and rephase remaining
purchases over the extended program.
The authorities inquired about the
possibility of an augmentation of access in
light of the oil shock. However, a detailed
assessment of the associated balance of
payments impact and financing outlook
showed that these were manageable within
existing program parameters.

The main risk for the program continues to be the difficult political situation.
While political tensions have eased recently, allowing for support of the core program
elements, Nicaraguan politics has historically been marked by sudden reversals. This remains
a central risk, especially going into an election year, and is a key factor driving the heavy
reliance on prior actions. Other risks include a possible deterioration of fiscal performance,
including from an inability to further raise power rates, from further wage increases, and

- 34 -

from a deterioration in tax administration if the new tax code is not amended, as well as the
continued fragilities implied by the highly dollarized financial system.
43.
Program monitoring. Prior actions for the seventh, eighth and ninth reviews are
summarized in Attachment II, Table 1. These have all been completed. Quarterly reviews are
proposed for the remainder of the arrangement to contain further downside risks to the Fund,
to be carried out by June and September 2006, based on the observance of the relevant
quantitative and structural performance criteria. Quantitative targets are being proposed as
PCs for end-March and end-June 2006. Reflecting the concerns over rapid wage growth and
high losses in the power sector, two new PCs are proposed on the public sector wage bill and
average electricity tariffs. New structural PCs are being proposed on the passage of a revised
tax code (end-March), amendments to the ESL (end-August), preparation of roadmaps for the
FRL (end-August) and pension reform (end-June) and benchmarks are being added on
decentralization, plans for further financial sector reform, and strengthening fiscal accounting
(Attachment II, Table 1).
VI. FINANCING ASSURANCES

44.
The program is fully financed for 2006. Multilateral and bilateral donors are
expected to provide substantial BOP and budget support to Nicaragua in 2005–06 in the
context of the Fund–supported arrangement.

45.
The authorities are making good faith efforts to resolve outstanding official and
private debt issues, and some progress is being achieved. The authorities are continuing
negotiations to obtain debt relief from non-Paris Club creditors, but progress has been slow
as a number of creditors are unwilling to provide relief on Paris-Club comparable terms.
Separately, the authorities have retained advisors as they seek to reach agreement with
remaining commercial creditors in the context of the preparation of a World Bank-financed
buy-back operation of commercial debt.
46.
The Executive Board has determined that Nicaragua meets the qualification
criteria for receiving debt relief under the MDRI. The Fund is prepared to approve MDRI
relief for Nicaragua as soon as the remaining consents of the contributors to the PRGF Trust
Subsidy Account have been received. The authorities are committed to use resources that
could be freed up by the MDRI to increase poverty-reducing spending. Under current
assumptions (implementation with effect from January 2006 for the Fund and July 2006 for
the Bank) the savings in 2006 would be around US$15 million (0.3 percent of GDP),
backloaded in the second half of the year. Corresponding adjustors have been added to the
program quantitative targets (TMU ¶s 20–24). These adjustors will be revisited at the time of
the next review, once the modalities and timing of the debt relief have been further clarified.
VII. OTHER ISSUES

47.
Nicaragua has taken significant steps to strengthen its economic statistics in
recent years, but important weaknesses remain to be addressed. A recent ROSC data
module found that while the existing legal framework is sufficient to provide the authority
for the collection and compilation of statistics, there is a need to strengthen its capacity to
obtain information from the private and public sector. Additionally, there is a need for further
improvements in the methodological basis and source data, as well as in the release of
advance publication calendars.
VIII. STAFF APPRAISAL

48.
The authorities have taken significant steps to reforge the domestic consensus
for the reform agenda supported under the PRGF arrangement. After a period when
structural reforms were halted, the recent political accord has fostered a productive
legislative session in support of key measures envisaged under the program. This reflects the
strong domestic support for the benefits engendered by the program, in terms of stability and
poverty reduction.
49.
The authorities have also been able to maintain a broadly stable macroeconomic
framework. The economy has continued to grow and several poverty related indicators have
improved. Meanwhile, the fiscal consolidation process has advanced and debt levels have
fallen. However, inflation has picked up, reflecting in part the impact of higher oil prices.
The authorities’ medium-term strategy seeks to enhance growth, promote
50.
stability and support achievement of the MDGs. Its prospects hinge on measures to boost

- 36 -

investment and productivity while increasing anti-poverty spending and reducing large
existing macro imbalances. This will require continued fiscal consolidation and reforms to
strengthen the investment climate and regulatory framework to take full advantage of the
opportunities offered by CAFTA–DR. Nicaragua’s external competitiveness has improved in
recent years, but containing wage pressures will be crucial going forward. The traded sector
has expanded rapidly but debt-creating external financing remains sizeable and further
reductions in the current account deficit will be crucial for assuring external sustainability.
51.
The fiscal strategy should focus on reducing debt levels while creating room for
poverty–reducing spending. With gradually paced fiscal consolidation adjustment made
possible by the continued availability of high levels of grants and other concessional finance,
debt levels would eventually start to decline and debt service levels remain manageable. It
will be important to reduce the numerous rigidities––including earmarking of spending––that
currently compress budget resources available for poverty-reducing spending. A first step
would be raising public awareness by discussing the impact of these rigidities in the context
of strengthening the fiscal responsibility framework (MEFP ¶9).
52.
The fiscal policy stance embodied in the 2006 budget will support stability in the
run up to the elections later in the year. The budget implies tight control over primary nonpoverty reducing spending consistent with achieving the authorities’ target of an unchanged
fiscal balance in 2006. To cover risks and create space for poverty-reducing spending, it will
be important to identify lower priority expenditures that could be cut, if necessary, to meet
the fiscal target, as well as to consider phasing out tax exemptions and lowering deductions
to mobilize additional resources.
53.
Losses in the electricity sector need to be tackled urgently. Further rate increases
should be implemented as soon as possible—while protecting the poor through continuing
the subsidy to low-usage consumers—and a mechanism for automatic adjustment of tariffs
with fluctuations in fuel costs should be put in place to prevent losses from occurring again in
the future. It is also important to reform the ESL and eliminate distortionary interventions in
the energy market, which could deter critically needed investment.
54.
It will be crucial to contain public sector wage growth to no more than expected
inflation. Given the large size of the public sector wage bill, and rapid increases of public
sector average wages in recent years, it is hard to justify significant further increases in
public sector wages at this time. Rapid wage bill growth raises risks for competitiveness,
fiscal sustainability and poverty spending. The budget appropriately builds in wage restraint,
but this will likely remain a key pressure point for the program in the 2006 election year.
55.
Action envisaged under the program by the central bank to tighten liquidity
conditions will help safeguard reserves and maintain stability. The supportive fiscal
policy stance will facilitate the central banks efforts to tighten liquidity conditions to curb
rapid real credit growth and maintain credibility before the elections. This will also help
contain rising inflation that could reflect second-round effects of the oil shock and demand
pressures including from the impact of the public wage hikes and high credit growth.

- 37 -

Keeping unchanged the rate of crawl of the exchange rate peg in 2006 will appropriately
balance stability and competitiveness. It will be important to consider moving to a more
flexible exchange regime over the medium term.
56.
Early action to strengthen the tax code is crucial to safeguard the fiscal
framework. Reforms to strengthen the tax administration have proven controversial in
Nicaragua, reflecting in part opposition from strong vested interests as well as concerns over
the possible use of the tax administration for political purposes. As such, the authorities’
desire to build a broad consensus for the measure is understandable. However, the code
approved significantly weakens the authority of the tax administration and raises risks that
collection could fall even in the near term. It is critical that the law be strengthened early on,
as envisaged under the program.
57.
It will be important to set the stage in the year ahead for advancing with
structural reforms to strengthen the fiscal framework at an early stage after the
elections. Steps have been taken as prior actions to safeguard the fiscal framework, including
approval of the FAL and deferral of the weak social security law. However, further actions
are required. The program recognizes the political realities and risks involved with tackling
difficult fiscal reforms in an election year. As such, key elements of the program in the year
ahead will include developing a plan, to be implemented by the next administration, for
introducing a credible FRL and for reforming the insolvent pension system. Moreover, the
flawed decentralization process also needs to be addressed. Steps taken as prior actions under
the program will mitigate fiscal pressures arising from the decentralization process.
However, a fundamental solution will require changing the laws underpinning the framework
in tandem with capacity building at the municipal level over the medium term. The program
benchmark on reforming the decentralization laws could constitute an important first step on
this likely long journey.
58.
The authorities have made commendable progress with strengthening the
financial sector framework. The key laws passed this year embody many core FSAP
recommendations. However, further work is needed to ensure smooth implementation of
these laws and completing other FSAP recommendations. The program extension provides a
valuable opportunity to take stock of the situation and policy requirements going forward
following election of a new government in 2006.
59.
The staff recommends approval of the authorities’ request for a waiver of
nonobservance of performance criteria, completion of the seventh, eighth and ninth
reviews, rephasing of purchases, financing assurances review and an extension of the
PRGF arrangement through December 12, 2006. This reflects the overall satisfactory
macro-performance, the authorities’ renewed commitment to the program, as evidenced by
the completion of a whole set of prior actions, as well as the introduction of new quantitative
PCs in areas that exhibited weaknesses in 2005 (wages and electricity tariffs). Satisfactory
assurances of external financing are evidenced by recent pledges of budget support by
donors, and the authorities’ intent to use the IDA Debt Reduction Facility to resolve the
commercial debt problem. Thus, the staff recommends completion of the financing

- 38 -

assurances review. The staff supports the authorities’ request for a waiver of the performance
criterion on the central government balance after grants as the deviation was minor and the
authorities are taking the necessary measures to keep the fiscal program on track. Staff also
supports the authorities’ request for a waiver of the structural PC on passing an FRL in light
of the authorities’ corrective actions, evidenced by the passage of the FAL and commitment
to develop a plan for introducing an FRL. An extension of the program should help support
the authorities’ macro-economic framework in the run-up to next year’s elections. It will be
crucial to continue to build public support and ownership for the key program elements in the
run-up to the elections to help shape the national dialogue.
60.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Nicaragua will be held
on a standard 24-month cycle.

VIII. Safeguards Assessments:

The updated assessment of the BCN, which was completed on August 29, 2003, found that it
continues to maintain strong safeguards and has taken steps to implement the
recommendations made in the 2001 safeguards assessment. The main recommendations of
the 2003 safeguards assessment and included the adoption of International Accounting
Standards (IAS). A task force has been established by the BCN to ensure adequate training
for the transition to full IAS. The updated assessment’s recommendations have been
implemented, with the exception of the adoption of full IAS, which is planned for the 2004
financial statements.
IX. Exchange Rate Arrangements:

In December 1995, the Monetary Board of the central bank approved the unification of the
exchange rate system effective January 1, 1996. With the unification of the exchange rate,
all previous exchange restrictions on payments and transfers for current international
transactions and multiple currency practices were eliminated. The central bank buys/sells any

amounted to US$1,493.6 million. The currently active portfolio consists of 14 projects for a total
commitment of US$373.2 million, of which US$131 million remain to be disbursed. The World
Bank Board of Directors is expected to approve the Second Agricultural Technology Project at
the end of November 2005, for US$12 million. The project’s principal objective is to provide
rural households and communities with broader access to sustainable agricultural, forestry and
natural resource management services and innovations, thereby stimulating higher agricultural
productivity in Nicaragua.
II. PLANS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS

2.
IDA completed a new Interim Strategy Note (ISN) in July 2005, which proposes an
extension to the program implemented in the last CAS (2003–2005). This two-year period will
allow for the continuation of successful operations that support the Government’s emphasis on
growth to address poverty and, in tandem, bring the CAS in-line with Nicaragua’s election cycle.
In terms of future lending, the IDA allocation for FY06 is SDR 40 million (US$58.5 million at
current exchange rates), and a similar amount is foreseen for FY07, provided that there are no
major changes in policy stance and performance. In alignment with the priorities identified in the
Government’s National Development Plan (which replaces the earlier PRSP), the ISN envisages
projects in rural infrastructure, competitiveness-strengthening and health. Further budget support
would be provided only if key measures agreed to in the PRSC policy matrix are implemented.

APPENDIX IV

NICARAGUA—STATISTICAL ISSUES
Introduction

Nicaragua’s economic data reported to the Fund are generally adequate for
1.
surveillance purposes. There are some statistical shortcomings in all sectors, which are being
addressed with technical assistance from the Fund, IDA, IDB, and USAID. The authorities
are cooperative in providing data to the Fund in a timely fashion, and in some cases, on a
daily basis. The Central Bank of Nicaragua (BCN) produces a monthly bulletin and an
annual report covering developments in the monetary, fiscal, external, and real sectors. The
BCN provides statistical information to the general public through the Internet. Among other
data the BCN has in its site the RED tables in agreement with Fund standard and a Debt
report.
2.
However, there are still problems of consistency among sectors, particularly with
respect to the fiscal deficit financing. Additionally, adequate monetary statistics are not fully
in use yet notwithstanding a long and intense TA to make them available for surveillance and
program purposes.
3.
The Nicaraguan authorities participated in a ROSC data module (January 2005),
signaled their interest in participating in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS),
and formally began participation in February 2005. It is hoped that participation will spur
strengthening of the country’s statistical system, and provide a framework for channeling
technical assistance resources optimally.
Real Sector

4.
Real sector statistics have improved substantially and GDP quarterly statistics are
about to be made available.
•

The national accounts estimates were revised and adopted in March 2004 The revised
accounts allow a better assessment of economic developments and prospects,
although there remain certain deficiencies in the coverage of services.

•

National Accounts: The Central Bank of Nicaragua (BCN) provides annual data by
sectors on national accounts in current and constant (1994) prices (with a 10-month
lag). The authorities make the first data revision in the second quarter of the
following year.

•

The consumer price index (CPI) with expenditure weights derived from a (1998/99)
household expenditure survey was introduced in 2001. The CPI covers Managua and
eight other cities. Expenditures (weights) and prices in rural areas are excluded.

•

Low response rates to price surveys for the CPI and the treatment of missing values
and quality changes require review.

- 61 -

APPENDIX IV

•

The consumer price index (CPI) is reported on a regular and timely basis. The BCN
publishes monthly data on CPI on the website www.bcn.gob.ni with 1½ weeks lag.

•

Exchange Rates: The BCN publishes monthly exchange rate data on the website
www.bcn.gob.ni.

Monetary accounts

5.
Monetary accounts are generally adequate and have benefited TA. However, there are
problems of consistency with respect to other sectors and particularly with the fiscal sector.
In this respect, the deficit financing is particularly a problem.
•

The monetary sector covers the accounts of the central bank (BCN), the commercial
banks (6), and the Financiera Nicaraguense de Inversiones (FNI, a second tier bank).
These data are compiled by the BCN (Economic Studies Department).

•

The commercial bank sector is comprised by: Banco de la Producción (BANPRO),
Banco de Crédito Centroamericano (BANCENTRO), Banco de América Central
(BAC), Banco de Finanzas (BDF), and Banco de la Exportación (BANEXPO).

•

There are six other very small financial institutions that are not included in the
coverage of the financial sector statistics.

•

Daily information on the BCN accounts is reported by e-mail (one-day lag).
However, the end of month information can be revised and the lag can be three to five
days. Monthly information on the commercial banks and FNI accounts are reported
on a monthly basis (two to three months lag).

•

Data on the financial system accounts are prepared by the BCN (two to three months
lag). Information on the BCN accounts can be found at the BCN internet website:
www.bcn.gob.ni.

Balance of payments

6.
Balance of payments statistics are compiled in broad conformity with the fifth edition
of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5) since 1995, within the limits set by the
availability of information sources. Nicaragua sent methodology notes describing the
compiling methods for balance of payments statistics which were included in Part 3 of
the 2002 Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook.
•

Data covers Nicaragua’s Balance of Payments statistics and various statistics related
to the external debt.

- 62 -

APPENDIX IV

•

With few exceptions, all data are provided quarterly. Monthly updates on exports and
imports and condensed BOP tables are available from the BCN website
(www.bcn.gob.ni), with varying lags. Debt data are updated continuously at the BCN
and are regularly available.

•

Balance of payments statistics provided by the Department for International Studies
at the Central Bank of Nicaragua.

•

Servicably external debt statistics are provided by the Administration for External
Liabilities at the CBN. Improvement of coverage is needed for external debt of public
enterprises, of banks, and of the private sector.

•

Nicaragua started compiling International Investment Position in 2005. Series for the
period 2001-2004 are available on the CBN website.

Government finance

7.
The Ministry of Finance (MoF) disseminates government finance statistics (GFS)
covering only the central administration. The MoF also compiles annual GFS for the
nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) for internal use and for reporting to the Western
Hemisphere Department (WHD). The Central Bank of Nicaragua (CBN) does report
budgetary central government data, although with considerable delay, for publication in the
International Financial Statistics (IFS). Neither the MoF nor the CBH has reported GFS data
for the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) recently.
8.
The fiscal ROSC mission in 2002 and the data ROSC mission in 2005 both found that
fiscal data in Nicaragua have serious weaknesses. The GFS issues related to coverage and
sectorization can be explained to some extent by the Public Administration Law, which
excludes the judicial and legislative branches from the data coverage of the central
administration. The fiscal data also present large discrepancies between the overall balance
compiled by the MoF and the financing data compiled by the CBH. Therefore, stronger
collaboration is needed between the MoF and the central bank to derive accurate and timely
estimates of external financing of the nonfinancial public sector. In general, these data are not
fully aligned with international standards, and there is no plan to migrate to the Government
Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). The July 28-August 14, 2004 GFS mission
produced a plan of action to improve fiscal data and proposed the creation of a working
group for GFS compilation to implement that plan. The mission also recommended that the
envisaged Integrated System of Financial Management be made to support the compilation of
GFS data and gradual migration to the GFSM 2001.

NICARAGUA: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS 1,2
While Nicaragua’s debt burden has been substantially reduced thanks to the HIPC initiative,
debt levels remain elevated and subject to a moderate risk of distress. Maintaining this riskclassification will be contingent on the continued reduction of the high level of domestic debt
and the realization of the growth prospects assumed in this analysis. Long-term debt
sustainability will continue to require the support of sound macroeconomic policies,
including pursued fiscal consolidation. Full delivery of expected HIPC debt relief is key to
reduce the risk of debt distress. The MDRI will contribute to lower debt-related vulnerability.

1.
Nicaragua has made substantial
progress in reducing its external debt
burden in the context of the HIPC
initiative (Table 1 and Figure 1). Since
reaching completion point in January 2004,
Nicaragua signed debt relief agreements with
almost all its multilateral and all its ParisClub creditors, as well as a number of nonParis Club creditors. As of end-October 2005,
total relief already committed amounted to
US$ 3.8 billion in nominal terms (76 percent
of GDP).3

the terms of debt reduction. The goal is to proceed with a buyback operation, financed by the
World Bank’s Debt Reduction Facility (DRF). As of October 2005, around US$ 0.9 billion in
NPV terms (18 percent of GDP) of HIPC debt relief was still uncommitted. Its delivery,
assumed in this analysis, is key to reduce current vulnerabilities.

3.
Domestic public debt increased in 2000-01 in the context of a banking crisis and
the settlement of claims arising from the expropriation of property, but has since fallen
with the pursuit of fiscal consolidation. As of end-2004, it amounted to about 30 percent of
GDP. At this point, more than 2/3 of the domestic debt comprises property indemnization
bonds (BPIs), issued by the government to resolve land disputes arising from expropriation
of property under the former Sandinista regime. Most of the rest comprises central bank
paper, issued on behalf of the government, to recapitalize intervened banks during the
financial crisis of the early 2000's. About 4/5 of the stock of bonds at end-2004 had a
remaining maturity of longer than one year. Domestic debt has fallen since 2003 in the
context of shrinking fiscal deficits and substantial net external financing that has facilitated a
substitution of domestic market debt with concessional external debt. This has also led to a
reduction in the net present value of total debt. However, gross financing requirements on
domestic debt in the next few years are expected to remain large, reflecting upcoming
maturities of BPIs, highlighting the need for cautious liquidity management and moving
forward with the fiscal consolidation effort.

APPENDIX V

Baseline scenario

4.
The baseline scenario for the debt sustainability analysis assumes that sound
policies sustain improving macroeconomic conditions over the medium-term.4 In such a
scenario, consistent with the authorities’ PRSP, investment in human capital and
infrastructure, financial sector development, and governance improvements boost total factor
productivity, allowing a rate of GDP growth of about 5 percent per year. As the impact of the
current oil shock is assumed to wane, inflation gradually decreases to around 3 percent
annually. Fiscal consolidation is pursued: a primary surplus is achieved by 2007 and
maintained thereafter. The current account improves gradually as exports benefit from
continued investment in the tradable sector and rising volumes of traditional exports, while
tourism activity converges to regional levels. Foreign direct investment is boosted by
CAFTA-DR and the improvement in business conditions. Despite a gradual reduction in
official financing to very small amounts, the coverage of net international reserves is
expected to improve and reach about 4 months of imports by the end of the projection period.
5.
CAFTA-DR is expected to enhance the growth performance of the whole
Central American region including Nicaragua. The main effects are likely to be a rapid
increase in trade flows with the United States, increased diversification of production by the
traded sector, a pickup in FDI inflows, and reduced macroeconomic volatility. Of all the
signatory countries, Nicaragua is expected to face the smallest fiscal impact, mainly owing to
a favorable schedule of tariff reductions. Sustained structural reforms, including further
strengthening of the business environment and regulatory framework, would help Nicaragua
leverage the full benefits of the agreement.5
The debt-burden thresholds used for the analysis are those applying to strong
6.
performers in terms of policies and institution quality, as measured by the World Bank’s
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment Index (CPIA). However, Nicaragua was only
recently reclassified into this stronger category, and that by a narrow margin.6 In this context,
debt indicators close to the thresholds reflect a vulnerable situation.

4

The baseline scenario does not consider the implementation of the MDRI. The impact of
this initiative is discussed in paragraph 10.
5
The implications of CAFTA-DR for Nicaragua are discussed in Chapter 1 of the
accompanying Selected Issues.
6
In 2003, Nicaragua was classified a medium performer.

7.
Under the favorable performance of the baseline scenario, Nicaragua’s external
public debt would still be high and remain a source of vulnerability for the next decade
or so, before falling well below the thresholds (Table 3). Even assuming full delivery of
HIPC relief by all creditors by end-2006, the net present value (NPV) of external public debt
would increase from 40 percent of GDP in 2005 to 53 percent of GDP in 2011, reflecting
continued heavy reliance on external financing of the public investment program. External
debt would only decrease below the 50 percent threshold after 2014. Debt as a share of
exports, however, would remain below the thresholds for the whole projection period,
reflecting the relative openness of Nicaragua’s economy.7 During the projection period, the
external debt service-to-export ratio would also remain well below thresholds owing to the
relative front loading of HIPC relief and the long grace periods granted by multilateral
creditors.
8.
Total public debt would show a similar path (Table 5). Under the baseline
scenario, fiscal consolidation would facilitate continuing the process of substituting
expensive domestic debt for external concessional debt for some time. Consequently,
domestic debt would continue to decline gradually. As such, given the high proportion of
external debt, the overall debt dynamics are dominated by developments of external debt.
Sensitivity analysis

9.
Even though the baseline scenario points to Nicaragua’s risk of debt distress
being reduced over time, the debt still remains vulnerable to shocks. Stress tests illustrate
the vulnerability of Nicaragua’s debt situation. Under the standardized bound tests provided
by the LIC-DSA external template, which simulate the impact on the baseline scenario of a
series of shocks to real GDP growth, export growth, GDP deflator, the amount of transfers
and FDI, and exchange rate, the external debt-to-GDP ratio increases rapidly above
7

Even measuring exports net of maquila imports (the completion point methodology), debtto-export ratios would remain below the 200 percent threshold.

- 68 -

APPENDIX V

70 percent (Table 4). In the most extreme stress test, the external debt ratio would not come
back below the 50 percent threshold before 2021. In that scenario, total public debt would
increase dramatically to over 90 percent and remain above 70 percent of GDP until 2015,
even assuming that the fiscal consolidation effort is maintained through time (Table 6).
10.
The implementation of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) would
help reduce Nicaragua debt’s vulnerability. The initiative would provide debt relief to
Nicaragua equivalent to about 8 percent of GDP, of which 2 percent for the Fund and
6 percent for the Bank.8 With the implementation of the MDRI, all indicators of external debt
sustainability would remain below thresholds for the whole projection period. The savings on
debt service should be used to increase poverty reducing spending without generating any
new debt burden. The dynamics of the external debt are mirrored by total public debt, given
that the MDRI does not have an effect on domestic debt.
Conclusion

11.
Nicaragua’s debt is subject to a moderate risk of distress, but can be managed
with the support of sound macroeconomic policies. Nicaragua’s risk classification will
remain contingent on the materialization of the growth prospects expected in the baseline
scenario and on the sustained quality of economic policies and institutions. While most ratios
remain below their thresholds in the baseline scenario, the threshold is breached in the case
of the external-debt-to-GDP ratio for several years. In addition, the high level of domestic
debt, if not successfully reduced, could pose a significant risk of debt distress in the medium
term. While full delivery of expected debt relief is essential to lowering debt stocks, and
delivery of relief under the MDRI would further reduce risks, reducing the probability of
debt distress in the medium and long-term will continue to require sound macroeconomic
policies, among which fiscal discipline is key.
12.
The authorities broadly shared staff’s assessment. Their own DSA is in line with
staff’s results. They agree that careful macroeconomic management is needed to ensure longterm debt sustainability, as recognized in the PRSP. The authorities also stressed that they
have one of the largest share of non-multilateral non-Paris Club debt in their total debt
among all HIPCs, and that this explains why progress in achieving the reduction of their debt
expected at completion point has been slower. Finally, the authorities welcomed the MDRI
and looked forward to benefiting from it as early as possible.

debt outstanding and disbursed as of end-2004 for the Fund and end-2003 for IDA.

APPENDIX V

Box 1. Change in the NPV of Debt-to-Exports Ratio from Completion Point
Nicaragua reached the completion point under the HIPC Initiative with a projected NPV-of-debt-toexports ratio of 168 percent at end-2004. Using the methodology of the Low Income Countries DSA
framework (DSF), this ratio as of end-2004 is now estimated at 110 percent, 58 percentage points
lower. This decrease is mainly explained by the changes in methodology, but also in part by
unanticipated changes in the variables used to calculate the ratio. The factors underlying the decrease in
the ratio are the following:
1. Changes in methodology. The bulk of the decrease in the NPV-of-debt-to-exports ratio (53
percent) is explained by the change in the methodology used to calculate Nicaragua’s debt indicators,
including changes in:
a. The definition of exports: The DSF methodology uses a gross definition of the maquila sector,
while the completion point definition included maquila exports net of imports. In addition, the
DSF uses same-year exports, as opposed to the 3-year backward average used for the completion
point.
b. The discount rate used to calculate the NPV of debt: the DSF methodology uses of a fixed 5
percent rate compared to the currency-specific discount rates under the HIPC methodology.
c. Exchange rates: Debt service is projected using WEO assumptions in the DSF, as opposed to
fixed (end-2002) exchanges rates used for the completion point.
2. Unanticipated changes in the variables used for the projection, including stronger-thananticipated export performance and slightly higher-than-anticipated new disbursements.

1/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
2/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
3/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
4/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
5/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 1.

ATTACHMENT I

Managua, December 27, 2005

Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Mr. de Rato:
We reaffirm our strong commitment to our poverty reduction strategy and the program
supported by the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). We would like to ask for a
completion of the pending reviews under the program, and that the PRGF arrangement be
extended through December 12, 2006. This will help support our macroeconomic policy
framework in the run-up to the November 2006 elections. The attached Supplementary
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (SMEFP) outlines the economic policies
and objectives of the Government of Nicaragua for the year 2006. Also attached is a
Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU).
Macroeconomic developments in 2004 were positive. Growth accelerated and inflation
remained in single digits, while most key program quantitative targets were met. Nicaragua
also reached the HIPC completion point in January 2004. The 5th and 6th reviews under the
PRGF were completed in September 2004.
In 2005, Nicaragua’s macroeconomic framework has been broadly stable, but has come
under pressure. This reflects the substantial challenges presented by higher international oil
prices, but also delays in the structural reform agenda. Combined with approval of a 2005
budget that widened the deficit relative to the executive’s proposal and included significant
public sector wage increases, this has prevented completion of program reviews in the past
year. Accordingly, we have taken steps to strengthen the 2005 fiscal framework. In the
context of a renewed national dialogue involving all political parties, we have also
reinvigorated our structural reform agenda through the passage of several key laws. With
these measures, we are confident that the economy will continue to grow, that inflation will
gradually subside, and that the fiscal program will remain on track. New performance criteria
are being established to help maintain stability, and set a roadmap for carrying the reform
agenda forward.
We have continued to maintain a close policy dialogue with the Fund in the past year. With
regards program performance in 2004 (no performance criteria have been established for
2005), we have met all quantitative performance criteria for end-June and end-September but
missed the performance criteria on the central government overall balance (after grants) for
end-December by a narrow margin. We have also been unable to submit a fiscal
responsibility law to the National Assembly by October 15, 2004, but propose corrective

- 77 -

ATTACHMENT I

action in the attached memorandum (¶12-13). We therefore, request waivers for
nonobservance of these two performance criteria and the completion of the 7th, 8th, and 9th
reviews under the program, rephasing of amounts committed, and an extension of the
arrangement through December 12, 2006. To ensure continued good macroeconomic
performance, the national assembly has approved a 2006 budget consistent with our PRGFsupported program.
We would like to take this opportunity to mention that even after reaching the HIPC
completion point, Nicaragua's debt obligations remain large. Participation in the Multilateral
Debt Reduction Initiative (MDRI) is very important for Nicaragua, as this additional relief
would release resources for poverty reducing spending supporting our efforts to meet the
Millennium Development Goals. We welcome this initiative and look forward to benefit
from it at an early point.
The request for completion of the financing assurances review is based on satisfactory
assurances of external financing evidenced by recent pledges of budget support by donors,
and on our intent to use the IDA Debt Reduction Facility to resolve our outstanding
obligations to commercial creditors. We are committed to continue good faith negotiations
with all non–Paris Club official and private creditors to seek debt relief in line with the
principle of equitable burden sharing among creditors under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.
We propose that the Fund carry out program reviews by June 2006 and September 2006,
based on the observance, respectively, of end-March 2006, and end-June 2006 quantitative
and structural performance criteria, as well as end-August structural performance criteria
established in Tables 1 and 3 of the attached memorandum.
The government of Nicaragua remains fully committed to the implementation of the Fund
supported program and is confident that the policies and measures set forth in the attached
memorandum are adequate to achieve the program's objectives under the PRGF arrangement.
Nevertheless, we stand ready to take, in consultation with Fund staff, any additional steps
that may be needed to keep our program on track. Recognizing the need for transparency, we
intend to publish the staff report and to continue to periodically inform the public on progress
under the program through various channels.
Sincerely yours,

/s/
Mario B. Alonso I.
President, Central Bank of Nicaragua

Mario Arana S.
Minister of Finance

ATTACHMENT II

SUPPLEMENTARY MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
The Macroeconomic Policy Framework

1.
Macroeconomic developments in 2004 were positive. Real GDP growth accelerated
to 5.1 percent driven by a strong recovery in exports, higher commodity prices and booming
remittances. Inflation remained in single digits. Nicaragua reached the HIPC completion
point in January 2004, leading to external debt relief of about US$ 4½ billions in NPV terms.
2.
The macroeconomic framework in 2005 has been broadly stable, but has come
under pressure, reflecting in part the impact of higher oil prices. The economy is
expanding but at a slower pace reflecting weaker external demand and higher oil prices. We

Fiscal Policy

3.
We have taken steps to strengthen the fiscal policy framework following passage
of the weakened 2005 budget late last year. The executive’s proposal targeted a reduction
in the CPS deficit relative to the expected 2004 outcome. However, the budget approved by
the National Assembly implied instead a smaller adjustment, and included an increase in the
total wage bill of some 21 percent. Most of this wage increase was received by health
workers and teachers. Accordingly, we have implemented revenue measures expected to
yield about ½ percent of GDP on a full year basis to bring the fiscal program back on track.
As a result, revenue growth this year has been strong, also reflecting continued
improvements in tax administration and a surge in taxes on imports. Combined with higherthan-originally-budgeted foreign grants, this has facilitated approval of a revised budget
increasing capital spending consistent with a projected CPS deficit of 2.2 percent of GDP in
2005.
4.
The 2006 budget approved by the National Assembly targets a CPS deficit (after
grants) of 2.2 percent of GDP, unchanged with respect to the estimate for 2005.
However, the underlying fiscal position would improve still further as the 2006 budget
includes one-time costs of about 1 percent of GDP related to the national and regional
elections. The underlying fiscal adjustment is consistent with our longstanding policy of
steadily increasing domestic savings and reducing the high public debt. The budget envisages
that tax revenues will be maintained at 17.6 percent of GDP. We remain committed to

- 79 -

ATTACHMENT II

avoiding any increases in tax exemptions, and to lowering these over the medium term, to
support our efforts in increasing poverty reduction spending. The budget prioritizes outlays
in a manner that protects crucial spending on human and physical capital accumulation. As a
result, despite additional one-time expenses on elections, we are maintaining povertyreducing spending at the 2005 level of 13.4 percent of GDP.
5.
The government sought in the 2006 budget to hold the increase in the wage bill
to no more than expected inflation to protect poverty-reducing spending and
competitiveness. Total central government compensation in 2005 is approaching 7 percent
of GDP and accounts for more than 1/3 of primary spending. Moreover, real public wages
are increasing faster than in the private sector. We are concerned that continuation of rapid
wage increases in the public sector will put pressures on private sector wages and ultimately
on inflation and competitiveness. However, we are committed to preserving the fiscal space
for poverty reducing programs. Hence, the budgetary wage bill has been increased by 9.7
percent y/y, slightly higher than expected 2006 inflation of 8.8 percent y/y. Indeed, in support
of our efforts to control the wage bill the program is establishing a quantitative performance
criterion on wage expenditures, comprising the bulk of the budgetary wage bill that can be
readily monitored and directly controlled.22
We have begun increasing electricity rates to eliminate quasi-fiscal losses in the
6.
sector. Oil fuelled plants account for about 80 percent of electricity generated in Nicaragua,
and the sector has been heavily affected by rising international petroleum prices. To begin
the process of eliminating these losses, we have increased rates by about 20 percent between
July and December 2005. We are committed to further price adjustments by June 2006
required in order to eliminate quasi-fiscal losses in the sector by December 2006. To support
achieving these goals, the program includes a performance criterion on further increases in
average tariff prices. In line with this, we have estimated that average tariff prices will need
to be raised by an additional 6½ percent before June next year, to reach a level of 0.1588
US$/KWh. We will review in coordination with the energy regulator, the need for action
depending upon actual developments in real input costs. Moreover, we intend to introduce by
June 2006 a mechanism for automatic adjustment of tariffs with fluctuations with real input
costs to avoid a repetition of the recent crisis in the sector. We will continue the policy of
targeted subsidies to protect low usage consumers from tariff increases.
Monetary and Exchange rate policies

7.
We are tightening monetary conditions to signal our determination to protect
reserves, support the crawling peg and help keep inflation under control. After overperforming in 2004, international reserves have been broadly in line with our 2005 monetary
program despite delays in disbursements of external funds. However, we are concerned that
22

See ¶9 of the attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) for definitions of
the wage bill that will be monitored under our program.

- 80 -

ATTACHMENT II

the increase in inflation could reflect second-round effects of high oil prices and demand
pressures that may negatively affect international reserves. Accordingly, in an early move,
we started tightening monetary policy in November this year. Furthermore, we will continue
supporting the monetary stance by increasing central government deposits at the central bank
in 2006. As such, we are targeting a reduction in NDA of C$974 million and an increase in
NIR of US$85 million in 2006.
8.
Keeping the rate of crawl of the exchange rate peg unchanged at 5 percent in
2006 will appropriately balance stability and competitiveness. In recent years, a key
objective of our program has been to gradually slow the rate of crawl to help to reduce
inflation, reflecting the high pass through of the exchange rate to prices. However, given
election related uncertainties, keeping the rate of crawl unchanged in 2006 will buffer shocks
and will help protect competitiveness.
Structural policies

9.
We are committed to further strengthening the fiscal framework including by
reducing budget rigidities, which are creating significant problems for fiscal management.
Significant earmarking of public spending is a key source of pressure on the budget,
crowding out poverty reducing spending, and distorting incentives. The government is
constitutionally required to transfer 6 percent of expenditures to universities and 4 percent of
expenditures to the judiciary. Combined with transfers to municipalities within the current
decentralization framework, they hamper fiscal management. We will seek to raise public
awareness of these constraints, and their implications for sustaining poverty reducing
spending, as we develop our plans to strengthen the fiscal framework that are outlined in the
next paragraphs.
10.
The government remains committed to achieving effective decentralization. It
has proven difficult to match devolved revenues and expenditures across municipalities.
Under the current legal framework, revenue transfers to municipalities are not linked to
expenditure responsibilities. As such, achieving effective decentralization will require
changing the municipal transfer law, the municipality law and other related laws. To
accomplish this, we have reached an understanding with the political parties to amend the
municipal transfer and municipality laws next year, to devolve expenditure responsibilities to
municipalities in line with revenues transferred to them and make other associated changes to
the overall decentralization framework. We are committed to these reforms and the program
establishes as a structural benchmark that revisions of the concerned laws be submitted to the
National Assembly by June 2006 (¶28 of the TMU).
11.
We have taken measures to achieve some devolution in the 2006 budget and
delay increases in transfers to municipalities. To achieve some devolution of spending
responsibilities, and to protect fiscal neutrality, the 2006 budget cuts capital spending on
municipalities by the equivalent of half of revenue transfers. To support implementation of
this budgetary provision, we have also issued a decree that curtails central government
spending in areas that are the responsibility of municipalities. The World Bank is providing

- 81 -

ATTACHMENT II

technical assistance to design appropriate incentive systems to ensure that expenditures at the
local level are consistent with national priorities. We are also working in partnership with
decentralized agencies to use existing central government budget execution mechanisms to
undertake projects on behalf of the municipalities. The 2006 budget maintains the transfers to
municipalities at 6 percent of government’s revenues and the assembly has amended the
transfer law such that the previously legislated increase in transfers to 10 percent of
government revenues in 2007 will be delayed. Instead, transfers will be increased to
7 percent of revenues in 2007, and another percentage point each year until reaching
10 percent of revenue in 2010 (however, transfers can be increased to 10 percent as soon as
laws referred to in ¶10 are passed consistent with the devolution of spending responsibilities
corresponding to the envisaged rise in transfers).
12.
Passage of a fiscal responsibility law (FRL) has been delayed but we have
approved a financial administration law (FAL) to strengthen the budget framework.
Approval of an FRL was a structural performance criterion for October 15, 2004. We
prepared a preliminary draft FRL that aimed to facilitate a sustained improvement of the
fiscal position, reduce the public debt, and increase transparency and accountability.
However, international experience indicates that FRLs have typically been successful where
they are accompanied by a national consensus on both their importance and their content. We
believe that we will need more time to build such a consensus before submitting the FRL to
the national assembly. Instead, we proceeded with the FAL that seeks to address concerns
regarding the budget process and framework. It provides for: (i) strengthening the monitoring
and control systems of the public sector; (ii) approval of all budgetary expenditures by the
assembly (including any financed with concessional resources); (iii) more clearly identifying
the roles of the ministry of finance and other government agencies in preparing the capital
expenditure budget of the public sector; (iv) establishment of a consensus-building
committee comprising representatives from the National Assembly and Ministry of Finance
to assess the feasibility of financing intended increases in overall budgetary expenditures;
and (v) placing time-limits on the assembly’s review of the budget.
13.
Developing a road-map for moving in the direction of introducing an FRL and
strengthening further the FAL is crucial. As such, the program introduces a structural
performance criterion on preparing a roadmap to strengthen the fiscal responsibility
framework (¶29 of the TMU) by August 2006, for consideration by the administration that
would assume office in January 2007. Such a road-map should aim to facilitate a sustained
improvement of the fiscal position, reduce the public debt, and increase transparency and
accountability. The proposal will also seek to expand the coverage of the budget to the entire
non-financial public sector and constrain the use of escape clauses to emergency situations
only (¶29 item 4 in the TMU). The road-map should include an evaluation of any
constitutional amendments that may be needed to achieve these reforms and recommend a
strategy moving forward.
14.
Reforming the pension system is also a key policy priority. A thorough revision of
the framework is needed to solve the actuarial insolvency of the current pay-as-you-go
pension system, which will begin to incur significant cash deficits in the medium term. A

- 82 -

ATTACHMENT II

high-level, presidentially–appointed commission had worked on a revised strategy for
pension reform. Recognizing that our original reform strategy, of moving to a fully funded
system, would have been prohibitively costly, the commission studied different options and
had open discussions with a broad segment of society and international specialists to arrive at
a concrete proposal. It is clear that difficult decisions will need to be made to make the
pension system sustainable. However, the National Assembly approved a reform of the social
security system on May 2005 that, if implemented, would accelerate the onset of the pension
system’s cash-flow problems and weaken the institutional framework for the system. As part
of a process of developing internal consensus for reforms, we reached agreement with the
political parties to postpone implementation of this law until after January 2007. This gives
us time to prepare a detailed roadmap spelling out how to bring Nicaragua’s pension system
back into actuarial solvency without relying on government financing beyond the coverage of
transitional costs. A structural performance criterion has been established under the program
to have this plan (¶30 of the TMU) prepared by June 2006 for discussion with interested
parties and consideration by the government after the elections.
15.
A new tax code was approved in October 2005, but with significant weaknesses
that we intend to address. Introducing a tax code to strengthen tax administration in line
with international best practices has been a key policy priority, with particular emphasis on
auditing, payment enforcement and sanctions. However, the version of the law that has been
passed has a number of crucial weaknesses that need to be addressed urgently. These
included: (i) limitations on the capacity of the tax administration (DGI) to request
information from tax payers, (ii) excessive discretion for the DGI to waive sanctions, (iii) an
overly time consuming system of appeals against the DGI’s findings on tax liabilities, (iv) a
tax audit system that in practice would prevent the DGI from conducting “desk audits,”
(v) introduction of limitations on tax payers’ liability in cases where returns are audited by
third parties (“dictamen fiscal”), (vi) inclusion of a “positive silence rule” together with a
relatively short statutory period for DGI’s rulings, (vii) lack of penalties for filing amended
tax returns when this is done within a 30-day period, and (viii) too rigid a system for dealing
with delays in the collection of tax liabilities (“efectos de mora”). Given the risks to the
continued effectiveness of the DGI, we intend to move quickly to strengthen the law. The
program includes an end-March 2006 performance criterion that the tax code be amended by
the National Assembly to address the concerns discussed here (TMU ¶27). These
amendments are crucial to give the tax administration the powers it needs to administer
effectively the tax system and to help raise taxpayers’ compliance levels.
16.
We are committed to reform the framework for the energy sector and
strengthen the recently approved Energy Stability Law (ESL). Encouraging investment
in the power sector to develop alternative energy sources and foster competition are key
elements of our strategy. In response to the crisis in the power sector, the ESL was approved
in September 2005, but, however, needs strengthening. The ESL provides the basis for the
regulator to adjust electricity rates on a high frequency basis (the previous framework
allowed adjustments only once per year). However, this law includes the capping of
electricity spot market prices and interventions in the market for petroleum products. There
are reasons for concern that these measures might create disincentives for future investment

- 83 -

ATTACHMENT II

and there is a need to review their potential distortionary effects. However, we need time to
conduct a thorough assessment of the options for further reform of the sector. As a first step
in this direction, the program will introduce as a structural performance criterion for endAugust 2006 that the ESL be amended to eliminate distortions (¶32 in the TMU).
17.
We have made substantial progress in strengthening the financial sector
framework in line with FSAP recommendations. The national assembly this year
approved a new banking law, and laws for the superintendency of banks and deposit
insurance scheme (FOGADE). Together, these laws embody several key reforms, including:
(i) strengthening the independence of the Superintendency; (ii) strengthening the legal
framework for consolidated supervision; (iii) improving banking resolution procedures;
(iv) enhancing the deposit insurance scheme; and, (v) reducing excessive scope for banking
secrecy. We have made further amendments to these laws to strengthen the intervention
process and increase safeguards against political interference in the day-to-day operations of
the superintendency.
Following on this, we intend to prepare a roadmap for further financial sector
18.
reform for consideration by the next government. Core elements of this plan will be to
advance on the remaining key FSAP recommendations and especially to develop steps for
supporting the development of the domestic capital markets. Important outstanding FSAP
recommendations that the roadmap will cover include: strengthening the independence and
financial position of the central bank, continuing reforms of the judicial framework for the
financial sector, strengthening the framework for management of land titles, and eliminating
maximum lending interest rates of micro-finance companies. Advancing in these areas will
require legislative measures including passage of the Law’s on Capital Markets,
Microfinance, Warehouse Deposits as well as reforms of the laws on the Central Bank and
Insurance. The program includes a structural benchmark on presentation of the roadmap to
the economic cabinet by August 2006 (¶31 of the TMU).

19.
A key area for future reform will be strengthening legal protection afforded to
bank supervisors, which is currently insufficient. After a comprehensive review of the
legal options to extend the protection of bank supervisors to include criminal liability, we
have found the avenues for progress in this area to be limited by constitutional
considerations. We intend, however, to continue to work on this issue, in order to identify
concrete measures to protect bank supervisors from criminal suits for actions undertaken in
the course of their duties and will prepare options for consideration by the new government
after the elections in the context of the roadmap for financial sector reform.
20.
Poverty reduction remains a critical and central element of our policy platform.
We have prepared a document to implement the Government’s National Development Plan
(PRSP-II), which undertakes a major review of our first Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP-I). The PRSP-II emerged from a broad participatory process comprising the poverty
reduction plans at the sub-national level. Critical to our policy platform are the objectives of
poverty reduction and achievement of the Millennium Development Goals through economic
growth, employment generation, increased investment and export promotion. Additional

- 84 -

ATTACHMENT II

strategic areas emphasized in the PRSP-II are: human capital development and social
protection, productive and social public infrastructure, and good governance and state
reforms. The government will sustain poverty spending at 13.4 percent of GDP in the 2005
budget and a similar percentage for 2006.
Other Issues

21.
The government is committed to strengthening debt management to support
long term fiscal sustainability. In addition to the implementation of sound macroeconomic
policies, including fiscal consolidation as described above, we have continued active
negotiations for debt relief, in good faith, with all our creditors in the context of the HIPC
initiative. Negotiations have been completed with all our Paris-Club and almost all our
multilateral creditors, as well as a number of non-Paris Club creditors. However, negotiations
have proven difficult with several other non-Paris Club creditors. We have hired financial
and legal advisors to help us negotiate debt relief from our commercial creditors, with whom
we aim to settle claims through the IDA Debt Reduction Facility. Even after full delivery by
all creditors of all expected HIPC relief, our debt level will remain above internationally
recognized sustainability thresholds. In that context, we welcome the recent Multilateral Debt
Relief Initiative (MDRI) to provide further relief on debt outstanding to the Fund and IDA,
and we look forward to benefiting from it at an early point. Finally, we also enhanced our
debt monitoring system by publishing a quarterly report on external and domestic debt.
22.
We plan to further strengthen the monitoring of fiscal performance. We are
working to shift the fiscal accounts (including debt service) to a modified accrual basis. We
will begin to monitor central government transactions on an accrual budgetary basis (defined
under the FAL) from January 2006. In order to eventually move toward accrual accounting,
we will prepare by June 2006, a budgetary classification manual of the nonfinancial public
sector. We also plan to strengthen our capacity to monitor the fiscal accounts from the
financing side to ensure consistency of financial data with the fiscal statistics derived from
the CPS data. The program introduces structural benchmarks on both these measures (¶’s 33
and 34 of the TMU).
Program Issues

23.
We are requesting a simplification of the quantitative program conditionality for
2006 to improve program monitoring, eliminate redundancies and increase
transparency. We believe that the performance criteria on the central government overall
balance (after grants) and on repayment of BCN and central government debt are no longer
necessary, given the broader fiscal target on the combined public sector. However, given
recent challenges, new performance criteria on the central government wage bill and the level
of electricity tariffs are being introduced. We would like to make the primary balance of the
central government a new indicative target, to maintain the focus on the central government's
medium-term debt dynamics. We believe also that the indicative targets on primary spending
of the central government, net domestic financing to the nonfinancial public sector, savings

- 85 -

ATTACHMENT II

of the combined public sector, and the overall balance of the combined public sector (before
grants) are no longer needed.
24.
We believe that a number of definitions of program targets should be changed.
In that context we are requesting that the fiscal program targets be defined on a basis that is
consistent with our budget presentation. We therefore request that the past program
convention of including HIPC relief from multilaterals in the fiscal accounts as grants be
discontinued. Program fiscal targets for 2006 should be set based on this revised treatment.
Also, we are considering for future programs strengthening the definition of adjusted NIR by
not counting foreign currency reserves of the deposit insurance fund that are maintained at
the central bank and currently added to adjusted NIR.
25.
We also request that the program quantitative targets be adjusted once we are
able to receive relief under the MDRI to: (i) allow an increase in poverty-reducing
spending by the amount of the debt service that would not be made as a result of the
implementation of the MDRI (the fiscal deficit targets would be relaxed accordingly by the
amount of debt relief which applies to principal payments); and (ii) account for the change in
BCN short term external liabilities resulting from any write off of the stock of debt to the
Fund.
26.
Implementation of the 2006 program under the PRGF arrangement will be
monitored through quarterly reviews based on the observance of quarterly quantitative
performance criteria, indicative targets and benchmarks (end-March 2006 and end-June
2006) as well as relevant structural performance criteria for end-March 2006 and end-August
2006. Quantitative and structural performance criteria are presented in Tables 1 and 2, and
defined in the attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding.

Monetary Targets

11.

Adjusted Net International Reserves (NIR) of the BCN are defined as
•

Gross foreign assets of the BCN that are readily available (which exclude
those that are pledged or otherwise encumbered including, but not limited to,
reserve assets used as collateral or guarantee for a third-party external
liability;

•

Minus short term reserve liabilities of the BCN including purchases and
credits from the IMF;

•

Minus foreign currency reserve requirement deposits of the commercial banks
at the BCN.

The Net Domestic Assets (NDA) of the BCN target under the program is defined
12.
as the difference between the change in the stock of currency issued and the change in
NIR valued at the program exchange rate.
13.

For 2006, the program exchange rate is 17.6 córdobas for one US dollar.

External Sector Targets

14.
Non-concessional debt of the combined public sector will be defined as the
contracting or guaranteeing of non-concessional external debt of the CPS, or by any other
agencies on behalf of the CPS. This limit applies not only to debt as defined in Point No. 9 of
the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt adopted by the IMF on
August 24, 2000, but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not
been received. External debt includes all current liabilities with a nonresident party, which
are created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form of
assets (including currency) or services, at some future point(s) in time to discharge the
principal and/or interest liabilities under the contract. This definition includes loans,
suppliers’ credits, and leases (operational and financial leases). The ceiling on contracting of
non-concessional external debt applies both to medium-and long-term debt defined as debt
with maturity of one year or longer, as well as to short-term debt, defined as debt with
maturity of less than one year. For program purposes, BCN instruments placed in the
domestic market held by nonresidents, will be excluded from the ceiling on the contracting of
non-concessional external debt. Debt with a maturity of less than one year for import related
credits, BCN reserve liabilities of less than one year, and borrowing from the Fund are
excluded from the ceiling.
15.
Concessionality will be based on currency-specific discount rate on the 10 year
average of the OECD’s commercial interest reference rates (CIRR) for loans or leases with
maturities greater than 15 years and on the six-month average CIRR for loans or leases
maturing in less than 15 years. Maturity will be determined based on the original loan

- 93 -

ATTACHMENT III

contract. Under this definition of concessionality, only debt with a grant element equivalent
to 35 percent or more will be excluded from the debt limits.
16.
External Payment Arrears are defined as debt service obligations arising from
external debt contracted or guaranteed by the public sector overdue by more than 15 days,
except on external debt subject to rescheduling or restructuring.
Balance of Payments or Budget Support is defined as official external untied
17.
financial assistance from loans and grants provided by foreign official entities that are
received by the government for unrestricted budgetary use.
B. Reporting

18.

The BCN will send to the IMF by electronic mail:
•

A daily report containing information on the daily accounts of the BCN with a
two day lag (stocks and flows);

•

A monthly report with information on the monthly accounts of the BCN
within four weeks and commercial banks, and FNI (stocks and flows) within
six weeks of the end of the month;

•

C. Adjustors

20.
The Overall Balance of the Combined Public Sector (after grants) target will be
adjusted downwards by the amount of principal payments to IDA and the IMF that would not
have to be made as a result of the possible implementation of the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI).
21.
The Primary Balance of the Central Government targets will be adjusted
downwards by the amount of total debt service of the government and central bank that
would not have to be made as a result of the possible implementation of the MDRI.
The net domestic financing of the combined public sector target will be adjusted
22.
upwards by the amount of principal payment to the IMF that would not have to be made as a
result of the possible implementation of the MDRI.

In the event that the MDRI is implemented, the NIR target will be adjusted upwards
23.
by the amount of stock of debt subject to IMF cancellation, minus any principal payment
(including those covered by HIPC relief) that would have been scheduled in the absence of
the MDRI between the date of implementation of the MDRI and the test date.
24.
In the event that the MDRI is implemented, the NDA target will be adjusted
downwards by the amount of stock of debt subject to IMF cancellation, minus any principal
payment (including those covered by HIPC relief) that would have been scheduled in the
absence of the MDRI between the date of implementation of the MDRI and the test date.
25.
The NIR target will be adjusted downwards (respectively upwards) by the cumulative
amount of any shortfall (respectively excess), up to a maximum total of US$ 25 million, in
balance of payments/budget support loans disbursed by the World Bank and the
Interamerican Development Bank as specified in Table 1.
The net domestic financing of the combined public sector and NDA targets will be
26.
adjusted upwards (respectively downwards) by the cumulative amount of any shortfall
(respectively excess), up to a maximum total of US$ 25 million, in balance of
payments/budget support loans disbursed by the World Bank and the Interamerican
Development Bank as specified in Table 1.

D. Structural Conditionality
Tax code (performance criterion)

27.
The amendments to the tax code, which will be discussed with Fund staff
before being submitted to the National Assembly, should include, but not be limited to
the following:
•

Tax administration power to request information. All taxpayers and government
entities should, for tax purposes, supply the information the tax administration
requests in the form and time frame that the tax administration deems necessary. To
this purpose there should be no need for a prior judicial order (Art. 27 of the tax code
(TPC));

•

Ability to conduct off-site audits: The tax administration should have the authority
to audit taxpayers at their legal address as well as in the tax administrations’ office
and other sites that it may deem appropriate. (Art. 67, Art. 27, and Art. 103, Num. 10
TPC);

•

Administrative silence. If the tax administration or the tax tribunal does not issue a
ruling on a case initiated by the taxpayer within the statutory time frame, this
“silence” should be interpreted as a negative answer to the petition and the taxpayer
would then have the option to either appeal that tacit ruling or wait until the ruling is
actually issued (Arts. 97, 98 and 99 TPC);

•

Suspension of the collection enforcement process. A system of guarantees to be
provided by the tax payer with tax obligations above a threshold that will be defined
in the law, should be established, in order to defer collection action by the tax
administration against tax payers with regards disputed tax claims (Art. 95 TPC);

•

Discretion to Waive Sanctions. The tax administration should not have the power to
waive sanctions and penalties for non-compliance (Arts. 129 and 137 TPC);

•

Audit Certification (“Dictamen Fiscal”). The Dictamen Fiscal should not limit the
audit powers of the tax administration. Further, even if the taxpayer uses the audit

- 96 -

ATTACHMENT III

certification, he/she should continue to be responsible for any error or omissions in
the tax return. (Art. 156 TPC).
Decentralization (benchmark)

28.
Amendments to the municipal transfer and municipality laws next year should
be made to achieve fiscal neutrality by explicitly linking revenues transferred to
municipalities to expenditure responsibilities that have been devolved to them. The
amendments should also make clearer the specific nature and modalities of the expenditure
responsibilities that are devolved to municipalities and make other associated changes to the
overall decentralization and budgetary framework, to support the achievement of effective
decentralization.
Fiscal Responsibility Framework (performance criterion)
The roadmap to achieve an effective framework for fiscal responsibility should
29.
include, but not be limited to, a discussion of the following key elements:

1) Ministry of Finance (MHCP)’s increased control over the design and execution of
the budget. The roadmap should explore the following issues:
•

Expand coverage of entities covered in the budget such that decentralized
agencies by function are fully integrated into the annual budget.

•

Increase expenditure flexibility, including by addressing earmarking. A
large percentage of expenditures are currently earmarked, which hampers the
ability of the ministry of finance to achieve effective fiscal management.

•

Complete the process of centralizing budget functions to strengthen the
MHCP’s control of expenditure ceilings of decentralized agencies, as well as
the capital budget.

2) Development of a Multiyear Macroeconomic Plan (MMP). The roadmap will discuss
what should be the key features of the MMP in the context of international experience
with fiscal responsibility laws. These features could include: (i) statement of the
principles of fiscal policy that the government will pursue (including management of
unexpected revenues), (ii) presentation of key macroeconomic targets (such as annual
reductions in the public debt-to-GDP ratio, medium-term primary surplus targets for the
central government, as well as debt ceilings for local governments, and state-owned
enterprises), (iii) responsibility for preparation of the MMP, (iv) macroeconomic
projections for the current year and the subsequent three years, and (v) link to targets of
the Annual Budget Law as well as its modifications during the year.
3) Monitoring and corrective action clauses. The roadmap should study how the
implementation of the MMPs targets will be assessed and reported on during the course

- 97 -

ATTACHMENT III

of the year. A discussion should be included regarding who would be responsible for
achieving the agreed targets.
4) Escape clause. The roadmap should note that appropriate circumstances for deviating
from the MMPs targets should relate to emergency situations only (such as in cases of
national emergency defined under the Law, including outbreaks of epidemic diseases,
natural disasters, and war), and discuss who could grant these waivers (in case waivers
are to be granted by the National Assembly, the law should clearly constrain the
circumstances when these can be granted).
5) Sanctions for noncompliance. The roadmap will discuss: (i) accountability for meeting
the MMP targets, (ii) sanctions for non-compliance against those judged responsible as
well as responsibility for assessing and enforcing sanctions. The plan should study the
trade-offs between stronger sanctions and pressures to include multiple escape clauses
and a narrower coverage of the public sector in the fiscal framework.
6) Inclusion of local governments. As local governments play an increasingly important
fiscal role in Nicaragua, the fiscal responsibility framework should consider a timetable
and outline the necessary conditions for their incorporation into the framework.
7) Role of political consensus. The roadmap should discuss a strategy for developing
consensus and political support for adoption of the fiscal responsibility framework.
8) Assess the constitutional implications of the fiscal responsibility framework
including the recently approved FAL. The roadmap should assess what changes to the
FAL and what constitutional amendments may be needed for a credible fiscal
responsibility framework.
9) Timeframe. The roadmap should spell out the timeframe for adopting the fiscal
responsibility framework and the sequencing of the needed reforms.
10) Modalities. The roadmap should be prepared by a committee appointed by the Minister
of Finance and including high level representatives from the MHCP, Central Bank of
Nicaragua and the Economic Commission of the National Assembly and be ready by
end-June 2006.
Pension Reform (performance criterion)

30.
The Pension Reform Plan should estimate the fiscal costs of the various
alternatives currently being considered and recommend a specific strategy to bring the
pension system into actuarial solvency. The analysis should include, but not necessarily be
limited to, sensitivity analyses on parametric reforms (such as changes to the retirement age,
minimum number of contributions, minimum pension, replacement rate), the relative
advantages and disadvantages of alternative pension schemes, and the different parameters
used in the estimation of the transition costs. The plan should include a specific
recommendation of a scheme that would move Nicaragua’s pension system into actuarial

- 98 -

ATTACHMENT III

solvency without relying on any government financing beyond the coverage of possible
transition costs. It should include the steps and timeline for implementation of the pension
reform, including the needed parametric reforms, which could be carried out as a first, step,
and also include time for discussion among all stakeholders and a schedule for introducing
the reforms. The plan should be prepared by a new commission appointed by the Minister of
Finance and including high level representatives from the MHCP, Social Security Institute,
Central Bank of Nicaragua and the Economic Commission of the National Assembly, and be
ready by end-June 2006.
Financial Sector Reform (benchmark)

31.
The roadmap for future financial reform should be prepared by a committee
including representatives from MHCP, the Superintendency, the Central Bank and
FOGADE and include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following key elements:
strengthening the financial position of the central bank, strengthening the framework for
management of land titles, and eliminating maximum lending interest rates of micro-finance
companies. The roadmap should include a timetable for passage and a discussion of the main
content of key laws including: (i) Capital Markets Law, (ii) Central Bank Charter,
(iii)Microfinance Law, (iv) Warehouse Deposits Law, and (v) a General Insurance Law. The
roadmap should also include a discussion of needed reform of the judicial framework for the
financial sector.
Energy Stability Law (ESL) (performance criterion)

32.
The ESL will be amended to: (i) strengthen the regulation of the electricity spot
market while eliminating controls on spot market prices for electricity, and (ii) strengthen the
regulatory framework for fostering competition in the market for petroleum products while
eliminating the possibility of introducing price controls and other arbitrary interventions in
this market.
Public Expenditure Management (benchmarks)

With a view to eventually moving to the accounting of the budget on an accrual
33.
basis, a budgetary classification manual of the total NFPS will be prepared by end-June 2006
as a structural benchmark under the program.
With a view to eventually measuring the execution of the budget from the
34.
financing side (below the line), a study will be prepared to: (i) assess the problems that are
currently preventing the computation of the below-the-line-financing, and (ii) recommend
ways to address this problem, including a timeframe for implementing the recommendations.
The finalization of this study by end-June 2006 will be a structural benchmark under the
program.

accounting department and to identify the necessary changes to the central bank law. The
auditor performed the reconciliation of the 2003 financial statements and prepared a report
that facilitated the establishment of a plan to initiate migration from Nicaraguan accounting
standards to IFRS by the end of the year 2006.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
January 18, 2006
Since the issuance of the staff report, the following additional information has become
available. This information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
•

Inflation in 2005 was slightly lower than projected. Preliminary full year data
indicate that inflation at end-2005 was 9.6 percent y/y as compared with the projected
10.5 percent. Lower-than-expected inflation reflects mainly some reduction in
domestic prices of petroleum products in line with international prices.

•

Tax revenues remained on track in 2005. Preliminary data through end-December
indicate that tax revenues in 2005 were in line with program projections of
17.6 percent of GDP, with nominal y/y growth slightly above 20 percent.

•

International reserves ended the year stronger than projected. Adjusted NIR
increased by US$71 million in 2005, as compared to the projection of a
US$15 million increase, such that the stock of adjusted NIR stood at US$282 million
at end-2005. This reflects mainly a higher than expected accumulation of government
deposits at the central bank in December. Data are not yet available to explain the
breakdown of the higher than programmed government deposits. This could reflect a
combination of delays in the execution of spending and higher than programmed net
external financing during December.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation
with Nicaragua
On January 18, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Nicaragua.1
Background
Nicaragua has made many important advances in the last few years. The economy has grown and
poverty has fallen in the context of a stable macroeconomic environment that has supported real
incomes of the poor and created more jobs. Several key reforms have advanced in the areas of
improving revenues, and strengthening governance and the financial sector framework.
Following a decade of economic decline, the return to democracy and adoption of economic
reforms in the early 1990s generated a strong recovery. Nonetheless, this period also saw the
emergence of new vulnerabilities, including high fiscal deficits and a widening current account
deficit financed in large part by official transfers. Moreover public sector debt levels remained
elevated at close to 200 percent of GDP. In 2000-01, the economy deteriorated sharply following a
severe banking crisis, a weakening of fiscal and monetary policy and a deterioration in the external
environment.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2The government that took office in 2002 moved quickly to address the large imbalances, tightening
the fiscal and monetary policy stance. The authorities’ economic program was supported by a
PRGF arrangement approved in December 2002. Real GDP growth increased from 0.8 percent in
2002 to 5.1 percent in 2004 and inflation remained stable, averaging 6.6 percent in this period.
Nicaragua reached the HIPC completion point in January 2004 and the NPV of the country’s
external debt should fall from 120 percent of GDP at end-2004 to 70 percent of GDP upon full
delivery of expected HIPC relief.
Subsequently, the economy has been adversely affected by the increase in international oil prices,
which has slowed growth and contributed to higher inflation. Real GDP growth is expected to have
moderated to 4 percent y/y in 2005 while inflation ended the year at 9.6 percent y/y and the foreign
currency reserve coverage ratio decreased to about 2.6 months of imports. The program went offtrack at the end of 2004 reflecting the impact of heightened political tensions on policy
implementation. Since then the authorities have sought to reforge the domestic political consensus
for economic reforms, strengthen the macro-policy framework and advance key structural reforms
to bring the program back on track. They have taken measures to bolster fiscal performance such
that the consolidated public sector (CPS) deficit after grants is expected to fall to 2.2 percent of
GDP in 2005. Meanwhile, monetary policy has continued to be conducted in the context of the
crawling peg exchange rate regime with the currency depreciating by 5 percent per annum.
In order to strengthen the macro-policy framework further, the 2006 budget targets an unchanged
CPS deficit in 2006 at 2.2 percent of GDP which should support stability in the run-up to this year’s
elections. To preserve competitiveness and the room for poverty spending, the budget contains the
growth of the public sector wage bill broadly in line with expected inflation. Since adoption of
Nicaragua’s first PRSP in 2001, poverty reducing spending has been increased from about 10
percent of GDP in 2002 to 13½ percent of GDP projected for 2005.
The authorities have made renewed advances on the structural reform agenda in recent months.
The assembly has approved three key financial sector laws, which together represent significant
reforms in line with FSAP recommendations. They have also approved the financial administration
law which strengthens budgetary procedures and the fiscal framework. Other measures have
sought to off set the fiscal impact of the decentralization process and contain losses in the
electricity sector.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Nicaraguan authorities for maintaining a broadly stable
macroeconomic framework, with continued growth, rising reserves, and lower fiscal deficits.
They welcomed the efforts of the authorities to strengthen the domestic consensus in favor of the
reform agenda supported by the PRGF arrangement. The recent political accord has allowed for
passage of key measures under Nicaragua’s reform program that hold the promise of
strengthening medium-term sustainability, and supporting the economic growth that will be needed
to reduce poverty levels—which remain among the highest in the region—and to achieve the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In this context, Directors welcomed the authorities’
commitment to use resources set free through the debt reduction provided by the Fund to
Nicaragua under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) for poverty-reducing spending, and

-3recommended that such spending be monitored closely. They encouraged the authorities to
continue negotiations with creditors, including non-Paris Club creditors.
Directors cautioned that, despite the positive orientation of recent policies, significant vulnerabilities
remain, including from the level of public debt—which is still high even after MDRI debt reduction—
a large current account deficit, and widespread financial system dollarization. In that light, prudent
macroeconomic policy implementation will be important, focusing on key structural reforms in the
fiscal, energy, and financial sectors aimed at fostering growth and promoting fiscal consolidation—
while increasing the scope for poverty-reducing spending. Directors welcomed Nicaragua’s
approval of the U.S.-Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR),
but noted the need to improve the investment climate, governance, and the legal and regulatory
framework further in order to leverage fully the Agreement’s potential.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ progress in implementing the poverty reduction strategy,
and the revised and improved second-generation PRSP (PRSP-II) that has been incorporated in
the 2005-2009 National Development Plan. They broadly welcomed the formulation of the PRSP-II
through a participatory process, and its emphasis on increasing economic activity and employment
in order to promote poverty reduction. Directors noted that poverty-reducing spending has
increased, resulting in an improvement in indicators in the education and water sectors.
They looked forward to the release of more recent data regarding poverty trends.
Directors commended the authorities for the disciplined fiscal policy stance of the 2006 budget,
which will support stability in the run-up to the elections. They stressed the importance of adhering
to the budget framework in the election year, and of identifying measures that could be taken in the
event of unforeseen shocks.
Directors encouraged the authorities, in light of the rapid growth of public sector wages over the
last few years, to maintain tight control over the public sector wage bill. They therefore welcomed
that the budget broadly contains the growth of the wage bill in 2006 to the expected inflation rate.
They urged the authorities to resist any pressures to increase public sector wages beyond program
levels. At the same time, a few Directors recommended that the authorities re-examine the
structure of the public sector wage bill to ensure that priority pro-poor services were not
compromised.
Directors supported the steps taken by the authorities to contain losses in the electricity sector,
which had begun to threaten the overall fiscal position, while protecting low-income electricity
consumers through targeted subsidies. Looking ahead, Directors noted that further rate increases
would likely be needed to fully eliminate losses. They emphasized the need to strengthen the
regulatory framework to attract much-needed investment in energy assets. In this regard, the
recently approved Energy Stability Law should be amended to eliminate distortional interventions
in the energy market.
Directors welcomed the central bank’s intention to tighten liquidity conditions to curb rapid credit
growth and safeguard reserves. They noted that this would also help contain the recent pick-up of
inflation, which seemed to reflect in part second-round effects of the oil shock and demand
pressures from rapid growth in credit and public wages. Directors agreed that the current crawling
peg exchange rate system is appropriate, and that keeping the rate of crawl of the depreciation of

-4the córdoba unchanged in 2006 would appropriately balance stability and competitiveness. At the
same time, Directors recommended that, after financial sector strengthening and full credibility of
the macroeconomic policy framework have been secured, the authorities should consider moving
over the medium term toward a more flexible exchange rate arrangement.
Directors stressed the importance of taking early steps to strengthen the elements of the tax code
governing the powers and operations of the tax administration. In this regard, they were concerned
that the tax code approved last year would weaken the authority of the tax administration and could
undermine revenue collection. Accordingly, Directors urged the authorities to amend the law soon
in line with international best practice, as envisaged under the program.
Directors welcomed the measures taken to safeguard the fiscal framework, including the passage
of the Financial Administration Law. They stressed that a significant fiscal reform agenda remains
to be articulated and implemented. In particular, Directors highlighted the need to develop a plan to
set the public pension system on a sound actuarial foundation and prepare a strategy to introduce
a disciplined fiscal responsibility framework. The decentralization framework needs to be reformed
to link the devolution of revenue transfers to municipalities with spending responsibilities and
accountability in a transparent manner. Directors also advised the authorities to consider reducing
earmarking of budgetary resources over time to support fiscal flexibility. They looked forward to
action in these critical areas soon after the elections.
Directors commended the authorities for the approval of several key laws on banking and
supervision, in line with many core FSAP recommendations, which they considered have
strengthened the financial sector framework. However, further work is needed to ensure smooth
implementation of these laws. Directors welcomed the authorities’ plans to incorporate additional
FSAP recommendations into their reform agenda, in particular, to strengthen central bank
independence and reinforce the protection of bank supervisors, especially against criminal
prosecution related to their good-faith official actions. The progress made in strengthening the legal
and institutional framework to counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism was noted,
but the authorities were encouraged to expand the Financial Analysis Commission and create an
independent Financial Intelligence Unit.

IMF Executive Board Approves Seventh, Eighth and Ninth Reviews Under Nicaragua’s
PRGF Arrangement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed today the seventh,
eighth and ninth reviews of Nicaragua's performance under its Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF) arrangement. In completing the reviews, the Executive Board approved
Nicaragua's requests for a waiver of performance criteria and an extension of the arrangement
from February 28, 2006 to December 12, 2006. In addition, the Executive Board completed the
financing assurances review under Nicaragua’s PRGF arrangement.
The completion of the reviews makes available SDR 13.9 million (about US$20.1 million) for
disbursement. Nicaragua's three-year PRGF arrangement amounting to SDR 97.5 million
(about US$140.9 million) was approved in December 2002 (see Press Release No. 02/53).
Completion of the latest reviews will bring total disbursements under the arrangement to
SDR 69.7 million (about US$100.7 million).
After the Executive Board's discussion of Nicaragua, Mr. Agustín Carstens, Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Chair, issued the following statement:
“Nicaragua’s performance under the PRGF arrangement has strengthened, as the domestic
consensus for economic reforms has been rebuilt despite a difficult political environment.
Key policy measures under the PRGF-supported reform program have been approved, including
fiscal and financial sector reforms. Nicaragua’s recent approval of the US-Central AmericaDominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) is also very welcome.
“Economic developments were broadly positive in 2005, notwithstanding pressure from higher oil
prices. Output continues to grow at a moderate pace, reserves have increased, and the fiscal deficit
has been contained, although the high level of inflation remains a concern. The IMF has granted
Nicaragua debt reduction under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), and the authorities
are committed to using the resources thus freed for poverty-reducing spending. At the same time,
it is important to strengthen debt reduction efforts by continuing negotiations with Nicaragua’s
creditors, including non-Paris Club creditors.

-2-

”Nicaragua nevertheless continues to face important economic vulnerabilities, in particular from a
still-high public debt, a large external current account deficit, and widespread financial
dollarization.
“The authorities’ medium-term strategy focuses on boosting growth through private sector
development while maintaining macroeconomic stability, to help further reduce poverty while
moving toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Going forward, the fiscal
consolidation process will need to continue, as will efforts to strengthen the investment climate so
as to take full advantage of the opportunities afforded by CAFTA-DR.
“The fiscal strategy for 2006 is centered on containing the budget deficit, while preserving the
room for poverty reducing spending. The authorities are committed to keeping growth of the
public sector wage bill in line with expected inflation to maintain stability, protect
competitiveness and avoid crowding out poverty spending. Steps have also been taken to
eliminate losses in the electricity sector, and the authorities intend to review the legal framework
for the sector to eliminate distortional interventions that could deter needed investment.
“Nicaragua’s key challenge going forward will be to strengthen the fiscal framework to assure
sustainability, and preserve the space for needed investment and poverty-reducing spending.
In this vein, tax administration will need to be strengthened, including by revising the tax code.
It will also be important to move ahead with reforms of the decentralization framework to ensure
that the transfer of revenues to municipalities is matched by the devolution of spending
responsibilities. Focus will also need to be placed on returning the public pension system to
actuarial soundness, and developing a credible fiscal responsibility framework.
“The authorities have moved forward with reforms to strengthen the financial sector, including
the passage of important financial sector legislation. They plan to prepare a roadmap to
implement additional reforms recommended in the context of the Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP).
“The authorities are to be commended for their strong commitment to the reform agenda, which
has helped to maintain a stable macroeconomic framework and set the stage for the
implementation of structural reforms that will be key to growth and poverty reduction.
The authorities’ focus on good governance and the fight against corruption is also essential to
achieving strong and lasting growth and poverty alleviation. At the same time, Nicaragua will
continue to depend on international support to reinforce its reform efforts,” Mr. Carstens said.

Statement by Moises Schwartz, Executive Director for Nicaragua
and Nina Conrado, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
January 18, 2006

On behalf of the Government of Nicaragua we would like to thank staff and management for
their policy advice and for their disposition for a continuous open dialogue. We would also
like to thank Executive Directors for their support to the country, especially with the recent
approval of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative. The authorities of Nicaragua are
committed to continue using freed up resources from debt relief to fight poverty and help
achieving the MDGs.
Our Nicaraguan authorities have shown a strong commitment and ownership of their
economic program, which has been supported by a PRGF arrangement. In late 2004, in the
framework of positive macroeconomic results and over performance of quantitative targets,
the program went off-track, with the approval of the 2005 budget that increased the deficit in
relation with the executive’s proposal. At the same time, the approval of constitutional
reforms without domestic consensus resulted in a tense political environment that affected
the structural reform agenda. During the first half of the year the government moved quickly
to protect the core elements of the program, identifying tax measures and implementing a
more strict control of expenditures. The fiscal targets went back on track and technical
discussions on structural reforms advanced despite the difficult political environment.
With the main objective of protecting macroeconomic stability, a wide political consensus
was achieved in the last months of 2005, which postponed approved constitutional reforms
until after the next presidential elections. With this new accord, the National Dialogue was an
effective scenario to agree on key policies, including ten prior actions to bring the PRGF
back on track. Taking into consideration the political scenario of the 2006 electoral year,
there was a front loading of economic and structural measures, which included the approval
on the 2006 budget, strengthening of financial laws, the approval of a financial
administration law, increases in electricity tariffs and reforms in the area of decentralization.
Despite uncertainties related to the political environment and the negative impact of the oil
shock, the macroeconomic framework for 2005 was positive. High oil prices not only had a
direct impact on inflation and on the current account, but also resulted in pressures for
subsidies in the transport and electricity sectors, as well as greater demands for public wage
increases. Nevertheless, the inflation rate was maintained in a single digit (9.6 percent y/y at
end 2005), the monthly indicator of economic activity for October shows a 4.9 percent
growth rate, in line with the projected GDP growth of 4 percent, and employment has been
growing. At the same time, export growth and the increase in remittances helped reduce the
impact of the oil bill on the current account, and the disbursement of external resources and
reduction of debt service made it possible to accumulate international reserves.
Based on a satisfactory macroeconomic performance and the compliance of prior actions
Nicaraguan authorities request the completion of the seventh, eight and ninth reviews under

-2the PRGF and waivers for the nonobservance of two performance criteria. The first one for a
small breach on the target for the overall balance after grants of the central government at
end 2004, and the second one on the structural PC of submitting to the National Assembly a
fiscal responsibility law. They also request an extension of the arrangement to December
2006 to continue supporting sound macroeconomic policies, especially during this electoral
year.
Fiscal policy
The fiscal strategy for 2005 and for the 2006 budget has included the strengthening of
revenues and prioritization and improvement on control over expenditures. This, coupled
with debt service relief, has permitted an increase in poverty reducing expenditures.
Revenues have been growing at a strong rate reflecting tax measures, growth in economic
activity and administrative efforts. Tax reforms during this administration have resulted in an
improvement on the composition of the tax structure, increasing revenues from income taxes.
To further strengthen tax collection and as part of the structural agenda, a Tax Code was
approved in 2005. The authorities are aware that the tax code contains weaknesses and have
already initiated technical discussions with the National Assembly to achieve the consensus
to make reforms. A PC on these reforms has been established for March 2006.
In terms of expenditures, two major policy issues refer to decentralization and the wage bill.
As part of the prior actions to complete this review, the 2006 budget approved maintains the
transfer to municipalities to 6 percent of revenues and includes a devolution of expenditures
equal to half of the transfer. The transfer law was amended to delay the increase in transfers
in the medium term, and a presidential decree was passed to curtail central government
spending in areas that should be the responsibility of municipalities. In order to further
improve the decentralization framework, an agreement was reached with political parties to
reform the municipal transfer and municipality law. A structural benchmark regarding these
reforms has been established in the program.
In relation to wage policy, the authorities are aware of the possible risks associated with rapid
wage increases and have agreed to monitor the wage bill as a PC on the program. Despite the
legal restrictions and limitations regarding wage policy, the authorities have taken corrective
measures to limit the growth of the wage bill, including eliminating vacancies and lowering
wage payments to consultants. However, it is important to mention that wage increases have
been in line with civil service reform and have been targeted to priority sectors such as health
and education.
Quasifiscal losses related to the electricity sector have also been addressed. Adjustment of
electricity tariffs to eliminate the fiscal impact of losses of the power sector started in July,
accumulating a 20 percent adjustment through January 2006, while maintaining targeted
subsidies to low usage consumers. In September an Energy Stability Law (ESL) was
approved allowing for high frequency adjustments. A PC to monitor further price
adjustments is being introduced, and a PC has been established to strengthen the ESL to
eliminate potential distortions to the sector.

-3-

In order to strengthen the fiscal framework, a Financial Administration Law was approved in
2005 and the development of a road map for the approval of a fiscal responsibility law was
established as a PC. The road map will address important vulnerabilities such as the
earmarking of spending, to be considered by the next administration. Additionally, reforms to
the pension system were postponed, and the preparation of strategy for implementation of a
new reform has been established as a PC.
Monetary and financial policy
The monetary program for 2005 was based on an effective coordination with fiscal policy,
that supported the strengthening of international reserves and the continuation of the policy
of domestic debt reduction. During the first half of the year, after over performing in 2004,
there was a moderate loss of international reserves, as a result of delays in disbursement of
external resources and lower open market operations related to uncertainties of the political
environment. Nevertheless, during the last months of 2005 monetary policy was tightened,
which coupled with a strong demand for monetary base, a stronger fiscal position than
expected, and external disbursement, resulted in the accumulation of reserves above the
annual target.
The authorities believe that their prudent monetary policy has been consistent with the
objective of supporting the exchange rate system, which has served appropriately as the main
instrument to anchor inflation expectations. At the same time, monetary policy has reduced
the central bank’s financial vulnerability by reducing the stock and financial cost of domestic
debt. For the medium term, the authorities are aware of the convenience of continuing to
reassess the exchange rate system, taking also into consideration relevant conditions such as
development of domestic capital market and sound fiscal policies among others. For 2006,
the monetary program will maintain the 5 percent crawling peg of the exchange rate and will
aim at further strengthening central bank reserve position, especially during the first
semester.
Substantial progress has been made in strengthening the legal financial framework, in line
with FSAP recommendations. In 2005, reforms were made to the banking law, the law of
superintendency of banks and the deposit insurance fund. The government plans to develop a
road map to further improve the financial sector framework.
Debt sustainability
Debt sustainability has been at the core of this government’s economic policy. Debt strategy
has included many fronts, the most important being the access to international initiatives such
as the HIPC initiative and more recently the MDRI. Other important policies have included
the strengthening of the debt framework through the implementation of the debt law, the
improvement of the debt monitoring system and the renegotiation of domestic debt. These
measures, coupled with fiscal consolidation have resulted in a positive impact on long term
sustainability, however, more still needs to be done.

-4Important steps have been taken regarding debt reduction. Thanks to the HIPC initiative,
Nicaragua has successfully completed negotiations with all its Paris Club creditors, basically
all its multilateral creditors, and nine non-Paris club creditors, covering together 61 percent
of expected HIPC debt relief. It is important to mention that in all its negotiations with
external creditors Nicaragua has adhered to the principles of comparable treatment and
equitable burden sharing.
The authorities are committed to continue implementing sound macroeconomic policies,
focusing on fiscal adjustment and a responsible debt policy. The government is committed
with the rest of the international community to advance towards debt sustainability and
liberate resources to help achieve the MDGs.
Looking forward
As part of the poverty reduction strategy, a second generation PRSP-II has been revised and
improved, and is now incorporated in the 2005-2009 National Development Plan. The
strategy focuses in four key areas: (i) economic growth for poverty reduction (ii) human
capital development and social protection, (iii) productive and social public infrastructure
and (iv) governance and state reforms.
The authorities believe that a comprehensive national plan is being presented. Private sector
led growth is being fostered with an improved investment climate based on macroeconomic
stability, improvement in public infrastructure and initiatives such as HIPC, MDRI and
CAFTA-DR. Public spending is being rationalized, supported by efforts to achieve a
multiyear budgeting process, and prioritization of poverty reducing expenditures, including
the tracking of HIPC debt relief through the Supplementary Social Fund. International
cooperation is being harmonized, the Joint Financial Agreement for General Budget Support
signed on May 2005 is another proof of the international community’s support and
confidence on the transparency and ownership of the government’s economic program, and
in 2006 the first investments of the US funded Millennium Challenge Account are expected
to take place.
The Nicaraguan government believes that the completion of the pending reviews of the
PRGF as well as the extension of the program will serve as basis for the continuation of
sound macroeconomic policies during the last year of this administration and during this
year’s electoral period, and will provide an appropriate framework for Nicaragua’s long term
objective of growth and poverty reduction. In line with the government’s transparency policy
the authorities intent to publish the related documents of this review.
