IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation
with the United Kingdom
On February 12, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with the United Kingdom.
The UK economy has been growing steadily. Economic recovery has been driven by robust
expansion of private domestic demand and has supported rapid job growth, with the
unemployment rate falling to 5.1 percent in late 2015.
Looking forward, growth looks set to continue, averaging around 2.2 percent over the medium
term. Inflation, which is currently very low (0.3 percent in January 2016), is expected to rise
slowly as disinflationary effects from past commodity price falls and sterling appreciation
dissipate, and as wages increase. However, this relatively benign scenario is subject to risks and
is sensitive to movements in global growth, asset prices, and productivity growth, among other
factors.
Policies have been directed to supporting growth, while strengthening public finances and
promoting financial stability. The overall fiscal deficit has been halved since 2009, and budget
plans aim for further gradual consolidation over the medium term, reaching a surplus by Fiscal
Year 2019/20. Accommodative monetary policy has helped offset contractionary effects from
fiscal consolidation, with the Bank of England maintaining the policy rate at 0.5 percent, given
subdued inflationary pressures. At the same time, financial sector policies have overseen steady
improvement in banks’ capital positions while also overhauling the financial regulatory
framework, laying out a comprehensive regime to support bank resolution, and directing
increased attention to the nonbank financial sector. However, notwithstanding some recent
deceleration in house prices and efforts to boost supply and contain housing-related risks, house
price pressures remain elevated, posing continued challenges for both macroprudential and
housing supply policies.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the United Kingdom’s strong economic performance, which has
delivered robust growth, record high employment, a significant reduction in fiscal deficits, and
increased financial sector resilience. Directors noted, however, that the relatively positive
outlook is subject to risks and uncertainties, including those related to the global outlook,
sluggish productivity growth, a weak external position, still-high levels of household debt, and
the forthcoming referendum on EU membership. They encouraged the authorities to remain
vigilant to the challenges ahead and to continue their policy efforts to promote growth and
further boost resilience.
Directors commended the authorities’ substantial fiscal consolidation efforts thus far and
supported their plans to sustain measures to achieve stronger public finances and further rebuild
buffers. They highlighted the importance of further strengthening the pro-growth and prostability aspects of the consolidation, including by scaling back distortionary tax expenditures,
reforming the property tax, and reducing the tax code’s bias toward debt. Directors encouraged
the authorities to explore both revenue and expenditure measures, while protecting spending in
priority areas, including healthcare, education, and infrastructure. They emphasized that
flexibility in the fiscal framework should be used to modify the pace of adjustment in the event
of weaker demand growth.
Directors supported maintaining an accommodative monetary policy while remaining vigilant in
case conditions change. They underscored that when monetary policy begins to normalize,
policies should be carefully communicated to ensure a smooth lift-off. More generally, Directors
agreed that a policy mix of tight fiscal and accommodative monetary policies should also assist
in external rebalancing.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue their prudent approach to financial sector
regulation and supervision. They emphasized that ensuring the safety of the UK financial sector
is critical for maintaining domestic and global financial stability. In this context, they encouraged
continued vigilance as the regulatory environment stabilizes following a period of considerable
reform and as the credit cycle matures, including by addressing emerging risks early, actively
using countercyclical capital buffers, and ensuring that risks do not migrate outside of the
regulatory perimeter. Directors welcomed efforts to strengthen standards for financial market
conduct, encouraged close monitoring of the nonbank financial sector, and looked forward to the
results of the ongoing Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP).

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors stressed that the buoyant housing market requires ongoing efforts to contain
macroprudential risks and address long-standing supply problems. They welcomed
macroprudential measures introduced since mid-2014, but noted that further measures may be
necessary if the reduction in high loan-to-income mortgages does not continue. Directors also
encouraged the authorities to extend the Financial Policy Committee’s powers of direction to the
buy-to-let market to mirror those they currently have over the owner-occupied market. They
noted that ongoing efforts to reduce housing supply constraints, such as changes to planning
processes, have improved prospects for increasing supply but require continued attention to
implementation.
Directors agreed that structural reforms should continue to complement macroeconomic policy
to help sustain growth and employment. They welcomed the authorities’ focus on improving
productivity, particularly by alleviating infrastructure constraints, addressing skills and labor
supply, and increasing housing supply.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Considerable progress has been achieved in the post-crisis repair of the UK
economy. Private-sector indebtedness has been reduced, the financial sector regulatory
framework has been overhauled, the fiscal deficit has been cut in half, and the
employment rate has reached a record high. With the output gap now nearly closed,
growth is expected to average near its potential rate of around 2¼ percent over the
medium term, with inflation rising slowly from its current low levels to the 2 percent
target by end-2017. However, this benign baseline is subject to risks, including those
related to potential shocks to global growth and asset prices, still-high levels of
household debt, the elevated current account deficit, and the degree to which
productivity growth will recover. Uncertainty associated with the outcome of the
forthcoming referendum on EU membership could also weigh on the outlook.
Continued efforts are needed to complete the post-crisis repair, promote growth,
and further bolster resilience.


In the baseline scenario, fiscal consolidation should continue as planned to rebuild
buffers, with flexibility exercised in the event of shocks. Efforts should continue to
make consolidation more pro-growth, including by scaling back distortionary tax
expenditures, reforming property taxes, and reducing the tax code’s bias toward
debt.



Monetary policy should remain on hold for now to help offset headwinds from fiscal
consolidation and given currently weak inflationary pressures. This mix of tight fiscal
and loose monetary policy should also help narrow the wide current account deficit.



As the credit cycle shifts and the financial sector’s new regulatory architecture sets in,
maintenance of an intrusive and conservative approach to supervision and
regulation will be essential to continue to mitigate risks.



Further tightening of mortgage-related macroprudential measures may be needed if
the recent reduction in high-leverage mortgages does not continue.



Structural reform priorities include measures to ensure that growth is not hampered
by constraints on housing supply, skills, labor supply, and infrastructure.

FOCUS OF THE CONSULTATION
1.
Economic growth and reforms have assisted repair of the UK economy following the
global financial crisis, but challenges remain. In recent years, the UK has experienced steady
growth with low inflation. Considerable progress has been made in repairing public finances and
private-sector balance sheets, and new fiscal frameworks and financial sector regulatory architecture
have been adopted. Nonetheless, important challenges and vulnerabilities remain—for example,
productivity growth is still well below pre-crisis levels; growth remains heavily dependent on
domestic demand, with a wide current account deficit; and household debt levels and fiscal deficits
are still high, despite progress in reducing them in recent years.
2.
The UK economy and financial sector also remain heavily interconnected to the rest of
the world. This is in general a source of major benefits via gains from trade, cooperation, increased
ability to specialize and realize economies of scale, and diversification of risks. However,
interconnectedness also implies that the UK is affected by global shocks and can also be a source of
important outward spillovers.
3.

Against this background, the consultation focused on the following issues:



What is the current state of the economic cycle in the UK and what factors have driven recent
economic developments?



What is the outlook for growth, job creation, and inflation?



What are the main risks and impediments to strong and steady growth?



How can the UK’s macroeconomic and financial sector policies support growth and limit risks,
both for the UK economy and globally?

MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT
In recent years the UK has enjoyed a robust economic recovery, led by private domestic demand. With
the output gap now nearly closed, growth is projected to average near its potential rate over the
medium term. Inflation, which is currently just above zero, is expected to rise slowly back to 2 percent
as one-off deflationary effects from lower commodity prices and sterling appreciation gradually
dissipate. The large current account deficit is also projected to narrow somewhat as returns on foreign
investments revert closer to historical averages. However, this relatively benign baseline scenario is
subject to large global and UK-specific risks.

A. Macroeconomic Developments and Outlook
4.
The UK economy continues to grow steadily. Output expanded by about 2¼ percent
in 2015, following a nearly 3 percent expansion in 2014. With recent upward revisions also to growth
estimates for 2011–13, the UK’s post-crisis

levels (Figures 1–2).

Productivity growth remains low, but has recently started to tick upward.



Productivity growth has been very weak during the recovery, averaging only 0.4 percent
(annualized growth in output per hour worked) during 2010–14, well below the 2.2 percent
productivity growth rate observed during the decade before the crisis.



This productivity slowdown likely reflects a combination of factors. Some of these may be
structural, given the broad-based slowdown in productivity growth across advanced economies
that predates the crisis, possibly reflecting changes in the nature of technological progress,
increased difficulties in measuring it, and/or changes in the pace of knowledge-based capital
accumulation, among other factors. However, part of the slowdown may also be cyclical and
therefore temporary, reflecting factors such as the post-crisis impairment of credit markets
inhibiting the flow of investment to more productive sectors (see the companion Selected Issues
paper).



More recently, productivity growth has started to rise somewhat, reaching 1.3 percent (y/y) in
the third quarter of 2015 (Figure 1).

7.
Looking forward, staff expects steady economic growth to continue in 2016. Lower
commodity import prices, higher global growth, buoyant residential and commercial real estate
prices (which should encourage investment), and ongoing monetary policy accommodation are
expected to support expansion, offsetting headwinds from a moderate acceleration of fiscal
consolidation (Table 3). On balance, staff projects growth in 2016 to remain around 2.2 percent.
8.
Staff projects growth to average around 2.2 percent over the medium term, as well.
This is based on the following assumptions:

labor productivity growth continues its recent acceleration, eventually reaching 1.7 percent,
(Table 2), but does not fully revert to pre-crisis productivity growth rates, given the possible

record high, soon stabilizes, and (iii) the
employment rate of those age 65+ continues
to rise in line with the trend over the last
decade, due to ongoing increases in
longevity and the state pension age.

Inflationary pressures remain subdued.



As of December 2015, headline inflation was near a record low at 0.2 percent; core inflation was
also subdued at 1.4 percent.



Low inflation partly reflects lower import prices due to (i) the 15 percent appreciation of the
NEER between Spring 2013 and end-2015 and (ii) the large drop in commodity prices since mid2014. However, domestic drivers of inflation have also been muted, with nominal private-sector
wages growing by only 2.1 percent as of November 2015 (Figure 1). Even if productivity growth
remains in the range of only 1 percent, this pace of wage growth would still be consistent with
underlying inflation of only around 1.1 percent.



Consequently, markets do not expect the BoE to raise its policy rate (currently 0.5 percent) until
2017. Under this scenario, staff expects inflation to rise gradually to 2 percent by end-2017, as
effects from past exchange rate appreciation and commodity price declines dissipate and
assuming a gradual rise in wage growth in response to tighter labor markets.

B. External Assessment
10.
The current account deficit has risen substantially in recent years, reaching 5.1 percent
of GDP in 2014 (Table 6). The increase has been due almost entirely to a weaker income balance.
Part of this decline could reflect structural factors, such as the UK’s increasingly favorable corporate
tax rates attracting more inward FDI, thereby reducing the stock of net FDI and in turn the income
derived from it (see the companion Selected Issues paper). However, part of the decline in the
income balance may also be temporary, reflecting factors such as unusually low returns on British
investments abroad, possibly due to relatively subdued growth in major investment destinations
such as continental Europe. Indeed, as the growth differential between the UK and other advanced

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED KINGDOM

economies has narrowed over the last year, the current account deficit has started to decline,
reaching 4.2 percent of GDP (sa) in the first three quarters of 2015 due to an improving income
balance.
11.
However, the current account was wider than justified by fundamentals in 2015, and
sterling appeared overvalued. For the full-year 2015, the current account is projected to be 4.1 percent of GDP. Adjusting for cyclical factors and temporary effects on the income balance yields
an underlying cyclically adjusted balance of -2.8 percent of GDP (see Annex 1 and the companion
Selected Issues paper). This compares to a current account norm of -0.3 percent of GDP, as estimated
by the EBA model, implying a current account gap of -2.5 percent of GDP and sterling overvaluation
of 11 percent. The EBA REER models provide a

associated with the high current account
deficit. First, financing of the deficit has shifted to somewhat more stable sources, such as FDI.
Second, even if exchange rate overvaluation does unwind rapidly, the BoE’s well-established
inflation-targeting framework should allow it to largely look-through the one-off effects on inflation,
as the BoE did during 2010–12, thereby avoiding pro-cyclical tightening. Third, the currency
composition of the NIIP helps act as an automatic stabilizer, as foreign assets have a higher foreigncurrency component than do foreign liabilities, such that sterling depreciation automatically
improves the NIIP and income flows via valuation effects.
13.
That said, a smaller deficit would be preferable. A large deficit may indicate underlying
imbalances, such as sub-optimally low public and

deficit—the largest among advanced economies

in 2014—and its general usefulness as an early
warning indicator suggests that the deficit should not

linkages with foreign investors. An accumulation of substantial external imbalances would thus be
best avoided, and policies that assist external adjustment could be helpful.

C. Risks and Spillovers
14.
The baseline scenario is subject to several risks. In the near term, risks to growth are
somewhat tilted to the downside, taking into account also the downturn in global asset markets in
early 2016. Specific risks are elaborated upon in the Risk Assessment Matrix (Annex 2) and include
the following:
Globally originating risks


Global downturn. Weak global growth and/or sharp declines in global asset prices would
depress near-term growth in the UK. For example, simulations suggest that the Global Asset
Market Disruption scenario outlined in the IMF’s most recent Global Financial Stability Report
would reduce output by 2.3 percent relative to the baseline scenario by 2017 (Annex 3).



China and emerging markets (EMs). A sharp slowdown in China and other EMs would likely have
only limited effects via trade channels, as they account for only 4 and 13 percent of UK exports,
respectively. However, financial sector linkages are somewhat stronger, with system-wide
exposures to China and Hong Kong SAR equal to about 150 percent of system-wide CET1 in
mid-2015. Nonetheless, the BoE’s stress tests released in December 2015 indicate that the UK
banking system’s core functions can withstand a severe downturn in China and EMs along with
lower growth in the euro area.

UK-specific risks


Medium-term productivity growth. Despite the recent pick up, productivity growth remains far
below its historical average, and the degree to which it will recover over the medium term
remains highly uncertain. If productivity growth is lower than expected, this would have large
adverse implications for medium-term output and incomes.



Real estate market-related risks. Housing and mortgage markets have decelerated somewhat
over the last year, and lenders have become more resilient. Nonetheless, house-price growth
continues to outpace income growth, and household leverage remains high by historical
standards. A leverage-driven re-acceleration of the market would further increase households
and banks’ vulnerabilities to house-price, income, and interest-rate shocks. Commercial real
estate prices also continue to rise rapidly, and a market correction could reduce business
investment and tighten corporate credit constraints, given lower collateral values (see later
sections for further details on real estate market developments).



Referendum on EU membership. The government is currently renegotiating the terms of the UK’s
membership in the EU, seeking changes such as increased leeway to limit benefits for new
immigrants and an opt-out for the UK from the objective of “ever closer union”. Following these

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED KINGDOM

negotiations, the government plans to put membership in the EU to a referendum as early as
2016 and no later than end-2017. Quantifying how a decision to leave the EU would affect the
economy is difficult, given that (i) the terms of staying in the EU are still being negotiated and (ii)
the nature of post-exit relations with the EU are unknown. However, analysts have raised
concerns that the exit debate could bring a period of uncertainty that could weigh on
investment.

years. The independent Office for
Budget Responsibility (OBR) and the BoE were both slightly more optimistic than staff on the degree
to which productivity would recover over the medium term, resulting in somewhat higher growth
projections, though the authorities agreed that uncertainty about productivity growth remained
large and was a key risk. Staff’s external assessment was viewed as reasonable. However, the
authorities noted that the external stock position remained relatively sound, not least because BoE
analysis showed that it would still be positive if all external assets and liabilities were measured at
market value.

POLICIES TO PROMOTE GROWTH AND STABILITY
Significant economic adjustment and policy reforms have been achieved since the crisis, with policies
since the last Article IV being largely in line with past staff advice (Annex 4). However, further efforts
are needed to complete the repair process. In particular, monetary policy should remain on hold until
inflationary pressures are clearer and to help offset headwinds from fiscal consolidation, which is
needed to help rebuild buffers. Such a mix of tight fiscal and loose monetary should also assist external
adjustment. Mortgage-related macroprudential policies may need to tighten if the recent moderation
of housing-related risks does not continue, financial sector supervision and regulation should remain
conservative and intrusive, and the structural
reform agenda should be completed.

A. Fiscal Policy
16.
The authorities have achieved
substantial fiscal consolidation over the last
five years. The overall deficit has been halved,
falling from 10 percent of GDP in FY09/10 to
5 percent of GDP in FY14/15. Nonetheless, both

UNITED KINGDOM

the deficit and debt ratio remain high relative to those in other advanced economies. Consolidation
has been achieved primarily by spending restraint (Figure 3).
17.

The authorities plan to continue gradual fiscal consolidation over the medium term.



The consolidation plan aims for gradual deficit reduction and an eventual surplus by FY19/20
(Figure 3, Table 3). As a result, the gross debt ratio is expected to decline steadily over the
medium term (Annex 5).



Consolidation will continue to rely
mostly on spending restraint, especially
for certain departments (e.g.,
Communities and Local Government).
Selected priority areas will remain
protected, including spending on the
National Health Service, which will
continue to increase every year in real
terms, and foreign development
assistance, which will be maintained at
0.7 percent of gross national income. Key
revenue measures include changes to
social insurance contributions and to
dividend tax.



Relative to the last pre-election budget
(March 2015), the authorities’ latest
fiscal plans as announced in the 2015
Autumn Statement envisage a smoother
path of deficit reduction. Consolidation
is also now based somewhat less on
spending cuts than previously projected,
partly due to revised revenue and
interest expenditure projections and
new revenue measures.

18.
The consolidation path is appropriate in the baseline scenario. Continued consolidation
is needed to rebuild buffers, thereby allowing more aggressive countercyclical policy during the next
recession. Such an approach should yield net gains, as fiscal multipliers are likely lower now than
they will be during the next recession, given that the output gap is nearly closed and that monetary
policy over the next few years would likely be tighter in the absence of fiscal consolidation. The
policy mix of tight fiscal and accommodative monetary policies should also support external
adjustment.

19.
However, automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate freely, and the fiscal path
may need to be eased if growth slows markedly. The stabilizers should operate symmetrically in
response to small deviations of a cyclical nature. In the event of an extended period of sluggish
demand growth—for example, if private investment is less robust than projected in the baseline—
the flexibility in the fiscal framework (see below) should also be used to modify the pace of
structural adjustment. In addition, the envisaged reductions in some categories of expenditure
remain sizable, and the government may need to show flexibility in finding alternative fiscal
measures if anticipated spending efficiency gains fail to materialize.
20.
Pro-growth and pro-stability aspects of the consolidation could be further
strengthened. Specific reform options along these lines include the following:


Scaling back distortionary tax expenditures (e.g., nonstandard zero VAT rates) could improve
efficiency, increase tax neutrality, and free up resources for other uses. Such uses could include
higher spending on priority items such as infrastructure, given that needs in this area are still
high despite recent increases in capital spending relative to previous projections. Such priority
items could also be funded by phasing
out the “triple-lock” for pensions, which
guarantees that state pensions rise each
year by the highest of CPI inflation,
wage inflation, or 2.5 percent. This
approach is costly, poorly targeted to
those most in need, and inconsistent
with international best practice, which is
generally to maintain a constant real
income in retirement via indexation only
to the CPI.



Property tax reform, along the lines recommended in the Mirrlees Review, could help reduce
vulnerabilities in the housing market by easing supply constraints. For example, rebalancing
taxation away from transactions and towards property values could boost mobility and
encourage more efficient use of the housing stock. Reducing council tax discounts for singleoccupant properties could also increase the utilization of these properties (see companion
Selected Issues paper).



Reducing the tax code’s bias toward debt could also promote financial stability. This could be
achieved by, for example, adopting an Allowance for Corporate Equity, with offsetting changes
in other corporate tax parameters to ensure revenue neutrality.

21.
The fiscal framework has been revised. Consistent with the medium-term fiscal plans, the
authorities have adopted a new fiscal rule requiring a budget surplus, starting in FY19/20, as long as
rolling 4Q on 4Q GDP growth exceeds 1 percent. Once projected growth falls below 1 percent, the
rule allows the government to run a deficit until conditions allow a return to surplus. The rule is not
a strictly binding one (as, for example, if it were enshrined in a constitution), but instead effectively

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

UNITED KINGDOM

operates on a “comply or explain” basis, adding another degree of flexibility. The rule is
supplemented by a target for public sector net debt to fall as a percent of GDP in every year to
FY19/20.
22.
The authorities recently announced plans to start producing a regular analysis of fiscal
risks. In mid-2015, the government undertook a review of the OBR to reflect on lessons learned
during its five years of existence. The review concluded that the OBR was functioning well, but made
some recommendations to further strengthen its operations. One of the key recommendations was
for the OBR to start preparing a new report on fiscal risks, as recommend by the IMF’s Fiscal
Transparency Code. The OBR plans to produce the first such report within the next two years.
Authorities’ views
23.
The authorities viewed their
fiscal plans as helping to bolster fiscal
resilience and improve public-sector
efficiency. They emphasized that
responsible fiscal policy should rebuild
buffers to allow for the fact that the UK
economy will continue to be hit by shocks
in the future. They agreed with the need to
maintain flexibility in the event of large
shocks, but noted that the new fiscal
framework covered most contingencies in
this regard, as UK growth has exhibited a “bi-modal” tendency in which it has been either relatively
strong (e.g., growth above 2¼ percent) or sufficiently weak that it would trigger the 1 percent
escape clause (see text chart). The authorities stressed that the composition of consolidation aimed
to support a competitive low-tax economic environment and prioritize efficiency gains, while
continuing to provide high-quality outputs in key areas such as science, infrastructure, education,
and health. In this regard, they emphasized that the pace of real cuts in departmental spending was
significantly slower than in the previous parliament.

B. Monetary Policy
24.
Monetary conditions remain accommodative. Current monetary policy settings—a policy
rate of 0.5 percent and QE assets of £375 billion—have remained unchanged since the last Article IV
consultation.
25.


12

Monetary policy should stay on hold until inflationary pressures are clearer.
Both headline and core inflation are well below target. Forward-looking indicators—such as
inflation expectations and wage growth in excess of productivity growth—are also wellcontained (Figure 1).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED KINGDOM



While the output gap is nearly closed, continued monetary policy accommodation is likely to be
needed to keep the output gap from re-opening, given the moderate acceleration of fiscal
consolidation.



Moreover, risks to policy errors are asymmetric, as the costs to inflation undershooting likely
exceed those of overshooting due to the increased complications related to easing monetary
policy when interest rates are near the effective lower bound (ELB). In this regard, some
moderate overshooting of the 2 percent target may even be desirable to more firmly escape the
ELB.



Current monetary policy settings thus remain appropriate until inflationary pressures become
stronger. However, policy should also stay data dependent and may need to adjust quickly if
conditions change, especially if core inflation or wage growth in excess of productivity growth
rises quickly.
UK: Real Yields on Government Securities 1/

26.
The medium-term neutral real rate is
likely to be lower than before the crisis. Market
expectations of future interest rates, as indicated
by long-term bond yields, have fallen sharply over
the last two decades, likely reflecting high global
savings and lower potential growth due to slower
population growth, among other factors.
27.
A lower neutral rate has at least two
important implications.



First, it implies that the current policy rate may not be providing as much monetary stimulus as it
may initially appear. This in turn may partly explain why inflationary pressures remain modest
despite a nearly closed output gap and further underscores the case for keeping rates on hold.



Second, a lower neutral rate implies that the odds of hitting the ELB will be higher going forward
than in the past. Consequently, contingency planning for addressing ELB-related problems that
may arise again over the longer run is welcome. Such planning could include, for example,
ensuring that the financial sector’s IT systems and legal contracts can incorporate negative
interest rates, among other issues.

Authorities’ views
28.
Monetary policy settings were viewed as appropriate. When the MPC judges it
appropriate to raise Bank Rate, careful communication will be important to ensure a smooth lift-off.
The BoE reiterated that the process of normalizing monetary policy should begin with rises in Bank
Rate and proceed gradually—with the neutral rate likely to remain below levels seen prior to the
financial crisis—and that QE asset sales should only be considered once Bank Rate had reached a
level from which it could be cut materially in the face of a negative shock.



Asset quality. Stronger capital positions have been supported by improving asset quality, with
the non-performing loan ratio falling to 1.8 percent at end-2014—less than half its post-crisis
peak (text table, Figure 4). Since the global financial crisis, UK banks have shifted the
composition of their loan portfolios towards domestic lending and away from foreign lending
and reduced their direct credit exposures to both other banks and nonbank financial institutions,
lowering their interconnectedness.



Profitability. Profitability, however, remains low relative to historic levels. In aggregate, UK banks
currently generate a return on assets about half that prior to the global financial crisis (text table,
Figure 4). In parallel, the shares of the major UK banks now trade at around their book value,
about half the multiple prior to the global financial crisis. The weak profitability of UK banks in
recent years has been driven by lower trading income, lower net interest income, and high
misconduct costs.



Liquidity. UK banks have strengthened their liquidity positions, with most major banks disclosing
that they have already satisfied the full Basel III end-point liquidity coverage ratio requirement of
100 percent. Banks have also reduced their reliance on short-term wholesale funding while
increasing deposits (text table, Figure 4), raising the overall stability of their funding.

30.
The government still has ownership stakes in Lloyds Banking Group (LBG) and the
Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), as legacies from crisis bailouts. With a business model focused on
UK mortgage lending, LBG has benefited from robust UK growth. The government plans to divest its
remaining ownership stake of less than 10 percent in the near future as market conditions allow. In
contrast, RBS remains in the midst of a major restructuring and deleveraging, designed to simplify
its business model and make it more domestically oriented. The government plans to divest at least
three-quarters of its 73 percent ownership stake gradually over the course of this parliament.
31.

The banking sector’s resilience to shocks is now regularly assessed by stress tests.



The 2015 stress test scenario featured a deep global macroeconomic downturn accompanied by
an abrupt tightening of financial conditions, concentrated in China and the Euro Area. The test
also incorporated severe but plausible future misconduct costs. The results, released in
December 2015, indicate that all seven major UK banks—which collectively account for over
80 percent of domestic bank credit provision to the domestic economy—have the capacity to
maintain lending under such a scenario, given their capital plans, including actions taken in 2015
(e.g., Standard Chartered announced in November 2015 that it planned to raise $5.1 billion in
shares and cut 15,000 jobs).



Beginning in 2016, the BoE plans to conduct two banking sector stress tests per year, combining
an annual cyclical scenario—the severity of which will vary with the financial cycle—with a
biennial exploratory scenario designed to probe resilience to other risks in between the biennial
European Banking Authority stress tests. Going forward, the integration of systemically
important nonbank financial institutions, such as central counterparties (CCPs), into the stresstesting framework should be a priority.

Balance sheet repair has helped shift aggregate bank credit growth back into slightly
positive territory, supporting economic activity. Going forward, bank credit growth is expected
to converge gradually toward nominal GDP growth rates, now that the bank credit-to-GDP ratio has
returned near pre-boom levels (i.e., circa 2000).

33.
As the credit cycle shifts and the new regulatory architecture sets in, continuation of
an intrusive and conservative approach to supervision and regulation will be essential. UK
financial sector stability is essential not only for domestic macro-stability, but also to avoid adverse
outward spillovers to the rest of the world, given the UK’s role as a global financial center. Priorities
for reducing risks include the following:


Addressing emerging risks early. Given its central coordinating role in maintaining financial
stability, the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) needs to continue scanning the horizon for
emerging systemic risks, while taking action in concert with the Prudential Regulation Authority
and the Financial Conduct Authority to remove or reduce them. In this context, the authorities
should, in addition to their ongoing monitoring of large financial institutions, continue to
monitor systemic risk arising from small and medium-sized financial institutions—which tend to
have correlated business models—through robust thematic microprudential supervision. Also,
the authorities’ recent efforts to push banks to bolster resilience to cyber attacks are welcome.



Countercyclical capital buffer (CCB). As the incipient financial cycle upturn in the UK gains
momentum, the FPC should raise the CCB from its current level of 0 percent and continue
raising it as warranted by credit conditions. While this is unlikely to significantly moderate the
financial cycle, it will enhance the resilience of the banking sector in line with the level of
systemic risk it faces. In this regard, the FPC indicated in November 2015 that a hike in the near
future was likely, though any initial increase in the CCB would likely be at least partly offset by
reductions in existing buffers, such that the first CCB hikes would probably not add to total
capital requirements for individual banks, but rather increase the transparency of the nature of
these buffers.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED KINGDOM



Risk weights. Supervisors should also
continue to carefully scrutinize risk
weights in banks’ internal models,
including to ensure that they are not
overly pro-cyclical. Although the
leverage ratio requirement helps
mitigate risks associated with internal
models, heavy reliance on the
leverage ratio as the binding capital
adequacy constraint could incentivize
banks to adopt excessively risky
lending behavior. In this context,
recently announced plans by the Basel Committee—in which the UK plays an important role—to
complete work to address the problem of excessive variability in risk weights by end-2016 are
welcome. Should the authorities identify immediate risks, the imposition of sectoral risk-weight
floors and heightened risk-weight disclosure requirements should also be considered.

34.
A comprehensive set of arrangements to support bank resolution is being established.
The UK regulatory framework includes three main elements relevant to resolution:


Ring-fencing. Effective January 2019, the major UK banks will be required to ring-fence their core
retail operations, insulating them from risks arising in their investment banking arms. The
Prudential Regulation Authority plans to complete its consultation process and publish final
ring-fencing rules well before January 2019, to give banks sufficient time to implement them.



Total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC). The Financial Stability Board recently finalized a TLAC
standard for global systemically-important banks (G-SIBs)—of which the UK is the home
jurisdiction for four—designed to ensure that they have sufficient equity plus eligible liabilities
to absorb losses and be recapitalized in resolution. Consistent with the EU’s Bank Recovery and
Resolution Directive, the BoE plans to impose a minimum requirement for own funds and
eligible liabilities (MREL) on all UK banks that will apply as of January 2019 for G-SIBs and
January 2020 for other banks. For UK G-SIBs, MREL will be set so as to implement the FSB’s TLAC
standard.



Resolution planning. The BoE conducts resolution planning for all UK banks, which will be
required to remove any substantive barriers identified to implementing the BoE’s preferred
resolution strategy. Discussions are also ongoing with other jurisdictions on the issue of
clarifying modalities for cross-border resolution.

These complementary requirements aim to mitigate the too-big-to-fail problem by (i) reducing the
likelihood of a systemic banking crisis by subjecting the major banks to greater market discipline
through their funding costs and (ii) reducing the macroeconomic costs of a major bank failure by
facilitating orderly resolution while insulating taxpayers from losses.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

UNITED KINGDOM

35.

It will be equally important to continue closely monitoring risks in nonbanks.



Nonbank financial institutions now account for nearly 50 percent of UK financial sector assets,
up from less than 40 percent prior to the global financial crisis. This expansion has been
concentrated among broker-dealers, pension funds, and investment funds. The resilience of
broker-dealers continues to improve, with their leverage ratios having roughly doubled since the
global financial crisis. Nevertheless, it is important that the FPC continue to assess the adequacy
of the regulatory perimeter to guard against the migration of financial stability risks outside of it.



Another priority is to ensure that UK insurers are resilient to the low interest-rate environment.
Although insurers’ assets and liabilities have well-matched durations, the low interest-rate
environment has steadily eroded their investment income as maturing assets have been
reinvested in lower-yielding securities. Nevertheless, UK insurers are sufficiently capitalized to
withstand the stresses specified by Solvency II, which came into force in January 2016.



The ongoing FSAP, which is due to be completed in mid-2016, will be an opportunity to further
assess the adequacy of steps taken to reduce risks in nonbanks, as well as to review broader
changes (e.g., the liquidity framework) to the financial sector framework since the last FSAP in
2011.

36.
The reform of ethics and conduct in the financial sector is ongoing. Financial institutions
in the UK have been charged substantial misconduct costs, and the restoration of public trust in the
ethical underpinnings of the financial sector remains elusive. The UK authorities are strengthening
incentives for financial institutions to provide financial services in an ethical manner, in part by
pushing accountability for misconduct down to the individual level, including via new measures such
as the Senior Managers Regime, which increases the responsibility of managers for misconduct that
occurs on their watch. Applying effective, proportionate, and dissuasive sanctions for misconduct,
including for AML/CFT violations, should enhance compliance and promote financial integrity. The
authorities’ efforts to promote global standards for the ethical provision of financial services are
welcome.
Authorities’ Views
37.
Post-crisis reforms were viewed as having bolstered financial sector resilience, though
challenges remain. The FPC judged that, on a system-wide basis, significant further capital-raising
was unlikely to be required. As a result, it foresees the sector transitioning to a more neutral phase
of the cycle in which credit growth is more able to support sustainable growth. At the same time,
newer risks, such as those related to cyber-security and expansion of the nonbank financial sector,
were gaining prominence and warranted close attention. On mortgage risk weights, the BoE agreed
that in some cases these were too pro-cyclical, but emphasized that leverage ratio requirements,
stress testing, and hypothetical portfolio exercises provided mitigating backstops, as did measures
under Pillar II of the Basel framework.

D. Real Estate Markets and Related Macroprudential Policies
38.
Housing markets have decelerated somewhat since mid-2014, but significant pressures
remain.


House-price growth has eased from 12 percent (y/y) in mid-2014 to around 8 percent in late
2015. The percentage of new mortgages with high loan-to-value or high loan-to-income ratios
has also declined (Figure 5). This moderate deceleration of housing and mortgage markets may
partly reflect policy actions, including tougher mortgage lending requirements (the FCA’s
Mortgage Market Review) and an FPC restriction that no more than 15 percent of a lender’s new
mortgages be at or above a loan-to-income
ratio of 4.5. Though the latter restriction was
not binding for the vast majority of lenders, it
may have had a signaling effect that prompted
them to reduce high loan-to-income
mortgages.2



Despite the recent slowdown, house prices are
still rising faster than incomes. Consequently,
the average price-to-income ratio is climbing
back toward its pre-crisis peak and has
exceeded it in London (Figure 5).

including of skilled workers, who are difficult to rehire quickly. Several smaller builders exited the
market, and some remaining ones have seen their financing conditions worsen. Together, these
factors have helped prevent housing completions from keeping pace with new household formation
since 2008. The rapid rise in house prices in recent years without an accompanying surge in net
mortgage lending (Figure 5) further points to supply constraints as an important driver of the
increase in prices.

Banks account for over 90 percent of mortgage lending.

40.
High house prices result in some households taking on high leverage, posing financial
stability risks. Despite recent declines, the percentage of new mortgages at high LTI ratios remains
well above pre-boom (i.e., circa 2000) levels, as does the aggregate household debt-to-income ratio,
which has stopped declining and is higher than in most other G7 countries. Such high leverage
significantly exposes households and banks to interest-rate, income, and house-price shocks.
41.
Further macroprudential tightening may thus be needed if the reduction in highleverage mortgages does not continue.


If needed, such tightening could take the form of tighter LTI and/or LTV limits on new
mortgages. Priority should also be given to the consolidation of household-level credit data so
as to allow a shift from LTI limits to debt-to-income limits, which cannot be evaded by taking
out multiple loans.



In addition, the authorities should extend the FPC’s powers of direction to the buy-to-let market,
which has accounted for about one-third of gross mortgage growth since 2012 and is
dominated by small-scale landlords (owning three properties or less), to avoid biasing the
market toward this segment. The powers of direction should mirror those the FPC currently has
over the owner-occupied market. Somewhat looser restrictions could be considered for
borrowing for new construction to avoid unintentionally restricting supply.

42.
Other policies also affect housing demand. The authorities should continue to monitor
the Help to Buy program and consider if it needs to be adjusted to avoid adding to demand for
existing houses. In addition, continuing to carefully monitor beneficial ownership of legal entities
and arrangements holding real estate is crucial for effectively implementing AML/CFT controls.
43.
Ongoing efforts to address supply constraints remain essential. Increased housing
supply will support near-term growth, reduce the need for excessive household leverage, and
promote social cohesion by lessening wealth inequality, as rising house prices have been a key
contributor to the latter in the UK. The government has undertaken a number of welcome initiatives
to boost housing supply in recent years, such as improving incentives for local governments to
approve new construction. The authorities should remain vigilant against local-level resistance to
effective implementation of these initiatives—otherwise
the risks associated with an approval process perceived
by many to be slow and unpredictable will remain. The
authorities should continue efforts to mobilize unused
publicly-owned lands for construction and explore ways
in which property tax reform could ease supply
constraints (see fiscal section above).
44.
Commercial real estate (CRE), with its rapidly
growing prices, warrants close monitoring. The CRE
market has been buoyant, with annual price growth
exceeding 10 percent as of mid-2015. Domestic banks

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED KINGDOM

have reduced their commercial real estate exposure, but international investors and nonbanks have
picked up the slack. CRE is particularly sensitive to swings in sentiment about economic prospects.
Since many firms rely on CRE as collateral to support their borrowing, a fall in prices could tighten
corporate credit constraints, reducing business investment and economic activity. Such an event
could also have negative outward spillovers via the sector’s cross-border financial linkages.
Authorities’ Views
45.
The authorities will continue to monitor real estate-related financial stability risks
closely, including household debt levels and also buy-to-let lending. In the second half of 2015,
the government introduced a suite of measures, such as reduced interest-deductibility for buy-to-let
mortgages and higher transaction taxes on buy-to-let purchases. The FPC are closely monitoring the
impact of these reforms on the housing market and have indicated that they are ready to take
further macroprudential action if necessary. After the mission, the government also announced a
consultation on providing the BoE with powers of direction over buy-to-let lending. At the same
time, the authorities emphasized that supply-side constraints were the main force behind high
house prices and reiterated that much had already been done, including significant reforms to the
planning system, and they remained committed to going further.

E. Structural Reforms
46.
Structural reforms are an important complement to other macroeconomic policies. UK
goods and labor markets are relatively competitive, with few major barriers to entry. Nevertheless,
structural reforms could help boost potential growth, thereby also raising real interest rates and
reducing ELB-related problems. Structural reforms will also increase competitiveness, assisting
external adjustment, and help address regional disparities.
47.

Reform priorities include infrastructure, skills, and labor supply:



Infrastructure: Domestic regional development and external trade are notably held back by
transport bottlenecks. Increased spending on infrastructure and an enhanced focus on
decentralization are therefore welcome. An important innovation is the recent formation of a
nonpartisan National Infrastructure Commission that is mandated to lay out long-term plans for
northern connectivity, London transport, and energy policy. This could usefully depoliticize
infrastructure planning and make infrastructure externalities more predictable for UK firms.



Education: Increasing signs of tightness in the market for skilled labor highlight the need for
ongoing investment in skills—only four-fifths of those aged 15–19 are enrolled in education,
below the OECD average. Further expansion of vocational training would help reduce doubledigit youth unemployment and make growth more inclusive. To this end, recent support for
apprenticeship programs is welcome.

Labor force participation is high overall but,
despite recent improvement, remains
below the OECD average for single women
with children. Recent changes to childcare
and to benefit conditionality could increase
participation.

economy is likely to continue; this may be

accompanied by increasing agglomeration
effects as knowledge-based jobs are concentrated in major metropolitan areas. Hence, housing
supply reforms are crucial to support a well-functioning flow of potential employees for such jobs
and to ensure that workers in critical support services—health, education, policing, and emergency
services—are not squeezed out of metropolitan areas. To this end, the development of
commercially-managed rental accommodation may be increasingly important. As discussed earlier
in the section on real estate markets, key policy measures in this area include continuing efforts to
reform planning regulations and improve incentives for local governments to approve new
construction.
Authorities’ Views
49.
The authorities agreed with the mission’s attention to infrastructure, education, and
labor participation issues. The current National Infrastructure Plan identified transportation and
connectivity as crucial for long-term development. In addition, the newly-formed National
Infrastructure Commission would take evidence and independently make recommendations for the
National Infrastructure Delivery Plan in early 2016. Skills and human capital were key components of
the productivity plan, published in 2015, to close the productivity gap between the UK and its peers.
Labor participation was at its highest level in almost 25 years; although female labor participation
was lower than the OECD average, the rate had been increasing in recent years, and childcare
benefits had been adjusted in the Autumn Statement to support those on low incomes.

STAFF APPRAISAL
50.
The UK’s recent economic performance has been strong, and considerable progress
has been achieved in addressing underlying vulnerabilities. Growth has been robust, the
unemployment rate has fallen substantially, employment has reached an historic high, the fiscal
deficit has been reduced, and financial sector resilience has increased.
51.
Steady growth looks likely to continue over the next few years, and inflation should
gradually return to target. Staff expects labor productivity to slowly improve, while lower

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED KINGDOM

commodity import prices, higher global growth, and ongoing monetary policy accommodation
would support growth and offset moderate fiscal consolidation. Inflation is expected to revert to
target gradually, as effects from commodity price falls and sterling appreciation dissipate and wages
increase.
52.
However, this relatively benign baseline is subject to risks. These include uncertainties
related to global growth, the degree to which productivity growth will recover, and the outcome of
the referendum on EU membership, as well as risks related to still-high levels of household debt,
elevated commercial and residential real estate markets, and a current account deficit that is wider
than justified by fundamentals. Risks related to the latter are mitigated by a naturally-hedged
international investment position and a well-entrenched inflation-targeting regime that should help
monetary policies look through any one-off price-level shocks. Nonetheless, the current account
deficit is strikingly large, and confidence shocks could reduce external capital flows into the UK,
adversely affecting growth.
53.
Given the outlook and these challenges, the current policy mix is broadly appropriate.
Steady and measured fiscal consolidation is warranted to restore healthier public finances and
rebuild buffers; supportive monetary policy will make this task easier, while also assisting external
rebalancing. Recent macroprudential policy measures have somewhat reduced housing-related risks,
and ongoing financial sector policies should help promote financial sector stability.
54.
The planned pace of fiscal consolidation is justified under the baseline scenario. The
planned path of deficit reduction over the medium term is notably smoother than foreseen at the
time of the 2014 Article IV consultation. In addition, revised revenue and interest expenditure
projections and new revenue measures allow deficit reduction to be based less on expenditure
consolidation than originally projected. Efforts to safeguard priority items such as foreign
development assistance are also commendable. Nonetheless, the envisaged reductions in some
categories of expenditure remain sizable, and the government may need to show flexibility in
finding alternative fiscal measures if anticipated spending efficiency gains fail to materialize. More
neutrality in the tax system—such as by scaling back distortionary tax expenditures, reforming
property taxes, and reducing the corporate tax code’s bias toward debt—and could help promote
efficiency and stability.
55.
The transparency of the new fiscal rule—with a focus on headline balances and a
simple and well-defined escape clause in the event of very low growth—is welcome. The
“comply or explain” nature of the rule, which requires the Chancellor to explain to parliament any
deviation from the rule but does not mandate any specific sanctions, adds another appropriate level
of flexibility. Plans to undertake regular analyses of fiscal risks should further bolster the fiscal
framework.
56.
Monetary policy should stay on hold until inflationary pressures are clearer. Although
low inflation mostly reflects temporary external factors, indicators of domestic-driven inflation are
also muted. Moreover, risks of policy errors are asymmetric—when the policy rate is close to its
lower bound, the costs of inflation undershooting exceed those of overshooting. And the policy rate

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

UNITED KINGDOM

associated with a neutral monetary stance is likely lower than what historical averages would
suggest, implying that the current policy rate is less stimulative than it first appears.
57.
The authorities should continue to take a prudent and intrusive approach to financial
sector regulation and supervision. The soundness of the banking sector has improved notably
since the crisis, and stress tests indicate its resilience to shocks. But finance is an inherently risky
business, and the financial sector in the UK is very large. Ensuring the safety of the UK financial
sector is not only a domestic concern, but is also critical to maintaining global financial stability. It
will be important to maintain vigilance as the regulatory environment settles, including by
addressing emerging risks early, actively using the countercyclical capital buffer, and continuing
close scrutiny of risk weights in banks’ internal models. Given its rising importance, the nonbank
financial sector should be monitored closely, including to ensure that risks do not migrate outside of
the regulatory perimeter and that insurers remain resilient in the low interest-rate environment.
58.
Financial market conduct and culture remain concerns. In this regard, the UK authorities’
efforts to promote (i) stronger standards domestically via measures such as the Senior Managers
Regime and (ii) a set of global standards for ethical behavior in the financial system are important
contributions to the global public good of well-functioning financial markets. Strong follow-through
and implementation of these initiatives will be key.
59.
The housing market requires ongoing efforts to contain macroprudential risks and
address long-standing supply problems. Macroprudential measures introduced by the FPC since
mid-2014 have eased but not eliminated risks to household finances. Further macroprudential
measures may therefore be necessary if the reduction in high-leverage mortgages does not
continue. The authorities should also extend the FPC’s powers of direction to the buy-to-let market
to mirror those they currently have over the owner-occupied market. In addition, the authorities
should continue to monitor the parameters of the Help to Buy program and consider if they need to
be adjusted. Continued efforts to reduce housing supply constraints are equally important; changes
to planning processes have improved the prospects for increasing supply, but require ongoing
attention to implementation.
60.
Continued structural reforms are necessary to complement the macroeconomic policy
mix and sustain growth and employment. In addition to important supply measures for the
housing market and strong implementation of reforms of the financial sector architecture—sectors
that are particularly important for the UK economy—measures are needed to ensure that growth is
not hampered by constraints on skills, labor supply, and infrastructure.
61.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place within the next 12
months. A mandatory financial stability assessment is also expected to be conducted in time for the
2016 Article IV consultation, in line with the five-year cycle for members or members’ territories with
financial sectors that are determined to be systemically important pursuant to Decision No. 15495(13/111), adopted December 6, 2013.

Annex 1. External Sector Assessment
United Kingdom
Foreign asset
and liability
position and
trajectory

Background. The net international investment position (NIIP) stood at -24 percent of GDP in 2014. The revised series shows a
declining external position from 2011. Staff projections for the current account and GDP suggest that the official NIIP to GDP
ratio would stabilize at around -30 to -45 percent of GDP by 2021, though the importance of uncertain valuation effects implies
significant uncertainty to these estimates. Gross assets and liabilities are more than 500 percent of GDP, reflecting the
international activities of large financial institutions.
Assessment. The NIIP and sustainability issues are not yet a concern. But fluctuations in the underlying gross positions are a
source of external vulnerability to the extent that they could lead to large changes in the net position.

Current
account

Background. During the recovery from the crisis, the current account (CA) balance deteriorated from -3 to -5 percent of GDP.
The decline in the CA balance is accounted for primarily by a lower income balance, reflecting a fall in earnings on the UK’s
foreign direct investment abroad, notably earnings on investment exposed to the euro area. The trade balance has been stable
at around -2 percent of GDP, despite a 9½ percent real exchange rate depreciation between 2007 and 2014. In the first three
quarters of 2015, the current account balance improved to -4.2 percent of GDP, helped by the recent oil price drop and an
improvement in the income balance.
Household and non-financial sector saving-investment balances have declined, more than offsetting the slight improvement in
the general government balance.
Assessment. The EBA CA regression approach estimates a CA gap of around -3.5 percent of GDP for 2015. However, the recent
deterioration in the income balance is not expected to be all permanent, suggesting a smaller underlying CA deficit and smaller
CA gap than implied by the EBA model. Taking this and other factors (such as the CA gaps implied by the REER regressions
discussed below) into account, staff assesses the 2015 cyclically-adjusted CA balance to be 1.5 to 3.5 percent of GDP weaker than
the current account norm.

Real exchange
rate

Assessment. For 2015, the EBA exchange rate assessment implied by the EBA CA regression model (adjusted by staff for
estimates of temporary effects on the income balance) indicates an overvaluation of 11 percent. The EBA REER regressions
estimate an overvaluation of 10 percent (REER Level model) and 12 percent (REER Index model). Staff assesses the 2015 REER as
5–15 percent above the level consistent with fundamentals and desirable policy settings; this assessment is informed by and
consistent with the staff’s CA assessment.

37

Capital and
financial
accounts: flows
and policy
measures

Background. Given the UK’s role as an international financial center, portfolio investment and financial derivatives are the key
components of the financial account.

FX intervention
and reserves
level

Background. The pound has the status of a global reserve currency.

Assessment. Large fluctuations in capital flows are inherent to financial transactions in countries with a large financial services
sector. This volatility is a potential source of vulnerability.

Assessment. Reserves held by the UK are typically low relative to standard metrics, and the currency is free floating.

Overall Assessment:
The external position in 2015 is weaker
than implied by medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policy
settings.
External deficits reflect insufficient
public and private saving rates.

Potential policy responses:
Sustaining a strong and durable
recovery in the UK requires rebalancing
away from public support toward
private-sector led demand, along with
greater reliance on external demand.
The current fiscal consolidation plan
implemented within a medium-term
framework and an accommodative
monetary policy stance contribute to
the goal of external rebalancing.
Further structural reforms focused on
broadening the skill base and investing
in public infrastructure will boost
productivity, improving the
competitiveness of the economy.

UNITED KINGDOM

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Background. For 2014 as a whole, the average REER was 8 percent more appreciated than for 2013. As of November 2015, the
REER has strengthened by 10 percent from its average level in 2014. This appreciation may reflect the UK’s relatively strong
domestic demand and differences in interest rates (both current and prospective) between the UK and many advanced
economies.

Source of Risks and Relative Likelihood

Expected Impact of Risk

Medium

High

Tighter or more volatile global financial conditions:



Sharp asset price decline and decompression of
credit spreads as investors reassess underlying risk and
respond to unanticipated changes in growth and
financial fundamentals in large economies, Fed policy
rate path, and increases in U.S. term premia, with poor
market liquidity amplifying volatility (short-term).



Tightened financial conditions and
market discontinuity.



Depressed investment, consumption,
and GDP growth due to increased
uncertainty.



Sharp reduction in asset and house
prices (including from reduced demand
from foreigners), suppressing aggregate
demand.

Low-Medium / Medium / High-Medium
Sharper-than-expected global growth slowdown:



Slowdown in GDP growth.





Persistently low real interest rates
complicating the operation of monetary
policy due to effective lower bound
problems.



Widening of the current account deficit.



A China slowdown’s effects via trade
may be limited, as China accounts for



Medium-High

Significant China slowdown, triggered by corporate
distress that propagates through shadow banks,
precipitating deleveraging, uncertainty and capital
outflows. Weak domestic demand further suppresses
commodity prices, roils global financial markets, and
reduces global growth (low in short-term, medium
thereafter)
Significant slowdown in other large EMs/frontier

Policy Recommendation if
Risk Occurs



Continue with
accommodative monetary
policy—including, if
necessary, rate cuts and
restarting QE—to offset
market volatility.



Allow automatic fiscal
stabilizers to operate; ease
fiscal path if growth slows
sharply.



Continue to allow liquidity
policies to be a backstop
against market volatility.



Continue with
accommodative monetary
policy for longer to
support demand. If
further support is needed,
cut the policy rate to at
least zero, followed, if
necessary, by restarting
QE.



Allow automatic fiscal
stabilizers to operate; ease

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The
relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a
probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of
concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

released in December 2015 indicate that
the UK banking system’s core functions
can withstand a severe downturn in
China and EMs along with lower growth
in the euro area.

Structurally weak growth in key advanced and
emerging economies. Weak demand and persistently
low inflation from a failure to fully address crisis
legacies and undertake structural reforms, leading to
low medium-term growth and persisting financial
imbalances in the Euro area and Japan (high likelihood).
Easy global financial conditions coming o an end and
insufficient reform progress undermine medium-term
growth in emerging markets and suppress commodity
prices (medium likelihood).
High

Persistently lower energy prices, triggered by supply
factors reversing only gradually.



Lower energy prices may boost
disposable income and consumption,
but weigh on investment in the energy
sector.



Headline inflation may be lower for
longer.

Disruptions to trade and capital flows:



The government is currently renegotiating the terms of
its membership in the EU. Following these negotiations,
a referendum on EU membership is planned by end2017, which could lead to an exit from the EU.

Medium-High



Quantifying how a decision to leave the
EU would affect the economy is difficult,
given that (i) the terms of staying in the
EU are still being negotiated and (ii) the
nature of post-exit relations with the EU
are unknown. However, analysts have
raised concerns that the exit debate
could bring a period of uncertainty that
could weigh on investment.



Implement structural
policies to boost
investment, productivity
and competitiveness.



Continue to allow liquidity
policies to be a backstop
against market volatility.



If persistently low energy
prices produce secondround effects that depress
medium-term inflation
expectations and core
price-setting behavior,
monetary policy may
need to be
accommodative for
longer.





Increased household leverage.







Higher exposure of the financial system

A rapid rise in house price-to-income ratios driven by
increased leverage would raise the vulnerability of
banks and households to adverse shocks to house
prices, income, and interest rates.
Medium

The current account deficit does not decline over the
medium term:



Yields on foreign investments could remain depressed,
hampering adjustment of the net income balance, and
external adjustment arising from the policy mix of tight
fiscal and loose monetary might not be adequate to
offset this.

Low



A build-up of large external imbalances
would raise risks of abrupt capital
outflows that could reduce business
investment and economic activity.



Large external imbalances also raise
risks of a sharp currency depreciation
that yields a burst of inflation. However,
this risk is mitigated by the BoE’s
inflation-targeting framework and by
well-anchored inflation expectations,
which should allow the BoE to mostly
look through the inflationary effects of a
one-off depreciation.



Aggregate balance sheet effects of
sterling depreciation should also be
positive, but dislocations could occur in
specific sectors/institutions.



Accelerate the
implementation of
productivity-enhancing
structural reforms.



Tighten monetary policy if
earnings increase ahead
of productivity.



Tighten macroprudential
policy by using new
macroprudential tools
(DTI and LTV limits).



Tighten parameters of
Help-to-Buy by restricting
the qualification criteria.



If the current account fails
to adjust, re-double
efforts to boost
productivity through
structural reforms and
raise saving via the fiscal
and monetary mix (i.e.,
further tighten fiscal
policy; this would allow
looser monetary policy,
thereby facilitating
adjustment of sterling
overvaluation and external
imbalances).

Annex 3. The Global Asset Market Disruption Scenario:
Effects on the United Kingdom
This annex documents the effects on the United Kingdom of the Global Asset Market
Disruption scenario in Chapter 1 of the Fall 2015 Global Financial Stability Report. This
global downside risk scenario is simulated using the Global Macrofinancial Model documented in
Vitek (2015).1
Under the Global Asset Market Disruption scenario, the realization of financial stability
risks delays or stalls monetary normalization in the systemic advanced economies. It
assumes an abrupt decompression of asset risk premia relative to the baseline amplified by low
secondary market liquidity in all of the systemic advanced economies as financial risk-taking
unwinds, interacted with the reemergence of financial stress in the Euro Area periphery. It also
assumes credit cycle downturns in all emerging economies to varying degrees, together with a
disorderly deleveraging in China, represented by additional increases in the default rate on bank
loans to nonfinancial corporates. Finally, it assumes suppressed economic risk-taking worldwide,
represented by additional confidence-driven private domestic-demand decreases. These specific
assumptions are show in Table 1.

The Global Asset Market Disruption
Simulated output effects, 2017
scenario generates a wide range of
macroeconomic impacts worldwide.
Reflecting lower financial and economic
risk-taking, output contracts by 2.6 percent
in the systemic advanced economies, by
1.6 percent in other advanced economies,
by 2.6 percent in China, and by 2.4 percent
in other emerging economies, relative to
the baseline by 2017. This wide variation in
output losses across economies reflects differences in shocks, exposures, vulnerabilities, and
policy space. In aggregate, world output contracts by 2.4 percent by 2017, while energy and
nonenergy commodity prices fall by 22.9 and 11.9 percent, respectively.
Under the Global Asset Market Disruption scenario, the United Kingdom experiences a
medium macroeconomic impact. Output contracts by 2.3 percent relative to the baseline by
2017, while consumption price inflation falls by 1.4 percentage points, and the unemployment
rate rises by 0.7 percentage points. However, net effects on the current account balance would
be modest.

Annex 4. Authorities’ Response to Past IMF Policy
Recommendations
IMF 2014 Article IV Recommendations
Fiscal Policy
Fiscal tightening for FY14/15 is appropriate. Given
the need to put debt on a downward path, the
government’s objective of eliminating the overall
deficit by FY18/19 is also appropriate.

Both revenue and expenditure items should be
explored to meet the medium-term fiscal
objectives. Consolidation efforts should carefully
consider issues of equity and efficiency.
Any new fiscal framework should have clearly
defined operating targets that can be directly
controlled by policymakers and are closely linked
to debt and its sustainability (such as overall
deficits), while allowing for flexibility to deal with
unexpected shocks.

Authorities’ Responses

The cyclically-adjusted primary balance was
broadly unchanged in FY14/15, but fiscal
tightening is budgeted for FY15/16 and
subsequent years. The deficit is expected to reach
a small surplus in FY19/20, which will put debt on
a firmly downward path.
Revised revenue and interest expenditure
projections and new revenue measures allow
deficit reduction to be based less on expenditure
consolidation than originally projected.
The new fiscal rule is transparent and simple. It
specifies a surplus in “normal” times, focuses on
the overall balance, and includes a well-defined
escape clause in the event of very low growth.

Monetary Policy
Monetary policy should stay accommodative.

The MPC has maintained an accommodative
monetary policy stance, keeping the policy rate
and stock of QE assets unchanged.

Housing Market
Prudential, rather than monetary policy
tightening, tools should be the first line of
defense against financial risks from the housing
market.
Supply-side measures are crucial to safeguard
affordability and mitigate financial risks.

Help to Buy should be regularly assessed.

The FPC has been granted powers of direction
over LTV and DTI limits in respect of mortgages
on owner-occupied properties. The Treasury is
consulting on granting similar powers for the
buy-to-let sector.
Planning regulations have been changed to
accelerate new developments. However, the July
2015 Budget imposes 1 percent annual rent
reductions in the social rented sector, which the
OBR assesses is likely to reduce affordable
housebuilding.
HMT monitoring shows Help to Buy accounts for
a small percentage of overall mortgage
transactions, mostly outside of London, and
predominantly at values well below the national
average. Mortgage guarantee loans have been
restricted to 4.5 times borrowers’ income, in line
with FPC LTI limits.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

43

UNITED KINGDOM

Financial Sector Policies
Further capital effort will likely be needed over
the medium term.
The multi-pronged approach to a more robust
regulatory capital framework is appropriate but
the authorities will need to communicate clearly
and early their regulatory expectations to
alleviate uncertainty.

Broadening the institutional perimeter of the
stress tests and strengthening supervision
beyond the major banks would be important.

The major G-SIBs have increased CET1 ratios and
are now broadly in line with peers.
The FPC announced in December 2015 its capital
requirements framework. In particular, the FPC
judged the appropriate aggregate Tier 1 equity
requirement for the banking system to be 11
percent at this time and viewed that, on a
system-wide basis, significant further capitalraising is unlikely to be required. In addition, the
FPC announced that it intends to make active use
of the time-varying countercyclical capital buffer
(currently set at 0).
The BoE wants to conduct system-wide stress
tests that would broaden their coverage to
include investment funds and other major
nonbank financial institutions. On supervision, the
BoE is engaged in efforts to develop a CRE debt
database to address CRE-related vulnerabilities.

Structural Financial Reforms
Stronger liquidity backstops will provide a buffer
against shocks, but supervision should be
strengthened commensurately to address a
potential increase in risk-taking.

The BoE has revised its liquidity insurance
framework to cover a broader range of key
financial institutions and markets, against a wider
range of collateral and for longer maturities. The
BoE regulates all recipients of liquidity insurance.

Reforms to address the problem of TooImportant-To-Fail institutions should be
completed. The agenda should ensure
international consistency of national reforms and
guard against regulatory arbitrage.

A comprehensive bank resolution regime has
been designed and will be in place by 2020
combining ring-fencing, TLAC, and resolution
planning requirements.

Supply-side Policies
Infrastructure. A further expansion in public
investment in infrastructure projects, within the
medium-term fiscal framework, along with the
implementation of well-designed guarantee
schemes, could provide the necessary
infrastructure to address capacity constraints.
Education. A further expansion in vocational
training and apprenticeship programs could
provide the needed skills for the young.

44

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

The Autumn Statement increased the
government’s infrastructure spending plans by
£20 billion in this parliament compared to the last
parliament.

The new government announced an
apprenticeship levy to finance apprenticeships.
The program aims to encourage more employers
to hire apprentices with the cost borne by large
employers.

Annex 5. Debt Sustainability Analysis1
The level of public sector debt remains high, but the authorities’ fiscal consolidation efforts in recent
years are starting to have an effect on the debt level. Public sector gross debt is projected to have
stabilized in FY14/15 at about 87 percent of GDP, and staff forecasts that it will decline to
80 percent of GDP by FY20. Fiscal consolidation will need to continue in the medium term to ensure
the debt ratio stays on a downward path and to rebuild buffers over time. All debt profile
vulnerabilities are below early warning benchmarks, but the projected debt trajectory is susceptible
to various shocks, especially a negative real GDP growth shock.
Baseline and Realism of Projections


Macroeconomic assumptions. Real GDP in FY15/16 is projected to grow by 2.1 percent,
supported by robust private domestic demand. In subsequent years, growth is projected to stay
around 2.2 percent. Inflation is projected to gradually rise closer to 2 percent in the medium
term. Short-term interest rates are projected to start rising from FY16/17, gradually increasing
by a total of 140 basis points by FY20/21.



Fiscal adjustment. The authorities aim to eliminate the overall budget deficit by FY19/20. In
staff’s baseline projections, the primary balance strengthens over the medium term from a
deficit of 2.6 percent of GDP in FY15/16 to a surplus of 2 percent of GDP in FY20/21.



Heat map and debt profile vulnerabilities. Risks from the debt level are deemed high by
DSA standards, as the level of debt exceeds the benchmark of 85 percent of GDP under the
baseline and stress scenarios. However, gross financing needs—estimated at around
12 percent of GDP in FY14/15—remain comfortably below the benchmark of 20 percent of
GDP, and all debt profile vulnerability indicators are below early warning thresholds.2 Interest
rates and CDS spreads also suggest that markets view debt vulnerabilities as low.



Realism of baseline assumptions. The median forecast errors for real GDP growth and
inflation (actual minus projection) during FY06/07–FY14/15 are -0.6 percent and -0.2 percent,
respectively, suggesting a slight upward bias in staff’s past projections. The median forecast
error for the primary balance is 0.4 percent of GDP, suggesting that staff projections have
been slightly pessimistic. The cross-country experience suggests that the envisaged CAPB
adjustment of 3.5 percentage points of GDP in FY15/16–FY17/18 appears to be slightly
ambitious. However, given the authorities’ commitment to fiscal consolidation, the path
appears credible provided that output continues to grow in line with the baseline projections.

The data are presented on fiscal year (April-March) basis with ratios calculated using fiscal year GDP (not
centered-fiscal year GDP). Public debt series include housing associations starting from FY14/15.

Gross financing needs are defined as overall new borrowing requirement plus debt maturing during the year
(including short-term debt).

UNITED KINGDOM

Shocks and Stress Tests
The DSA suggests that medium-term debt dynamics are not highly sensitive to interest rate
shocks given the long average maturity of government debt (about 14 years), but remain
susceptible to growth shocks.


Growth shock. In this scenario, real output growth rates are lowered by one standard
deviation in FY16/17 and FY17/18. The primary balance improves much more slowly than in
the baseline, reaching a surplus of 0.1 percent of GDP only in FY20/21. Under these
assumptions, the debt-to-GDP ratio rises to 93 percent of GDP by FY17/18 and declines only
gradually thereafter. Gross financing needs rise slightly to about 13 percent of GDP by
FY17/18 and stays above 12 percent through FY20/21.



Primary balance shock. This scenario assumes that fiscal consolidation stalls between
FY15/16 and FY16/17, with no change in the primary balance. The debt-to GDP ratio rises
slightly to 88.5 percent of GDP in FY16/17 and falls thereafter to 82 percent of GDP by
FY20/21, about 4 percentage points of GDP higher than the baseline. Gross financing needs
also rise to 12 percent of GDP by FY17/18.



Interest rate shock. In this scenario, a 200 basis points increase in interest rates is assumed
from FY16/17 on. The effective interest rate edges up to 3.7 percent by FY20/21, but only
½ percentage points higher than the baseline. The impacts on debt and gross financing
needs are expected to be mild.



Combined macro-fiscal scenario. This scenario aggregates shocks to real growth, the
interest rate, and the primary balance. Under these assumptions, the debt-to-GDP ratio
reaches close to 94 percent of GDP in FY17/18 and declines only gradually to 93 percent of
GDP by FY20/21. Gross financing needs would rise to 13 percent by FY20/21.



Contingent fiscal shock. This scenario assumes, hypothetically, that a banking crisis leads to
one-time bail out of the financial sector, raising non-interest expenditure by 3 percent of
banking sector assets in FY16/17. Real GDP is also reduced by one standard deviation for two
years. Under this hypothetical scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio would rise to 102 percent of
GDP in FY17/18, and gross financing needs would exceed 20 percent of GDP at their peak.



Stagnant growth and low inflation scenario. This scenario assumes that real growth would
slow and remain stagnant while inflation also stays well below the inflation target throughout
the projection period. This event could be triggered by globally weak demand and
persistently low inflation in advanced economies. With subdued growth rates, revenue
growth would lack buoyancy, and the revenue-to-GDP ratio would fall short of that in the
baseline by one percentage point of GDP. Debt would not be put on a clear downward path,
with the debt ratio staying above the FY14/15 level. Gross financing needs would hover
around 11 percent of GDP.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Economic and financial data provided to the Fund are considered adequate for surveillance
purposes. The United Kingdom subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and
meets the SDDS specifications for the coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of data. SDDS metadata
are posted on the Dissemination Standard Bulletin Board (DSBB). The UK has adopted the European
System of National and Regional Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010) and the Balance of Payment and
International Investment Position Manual, sixth edition (BPM6).
The UK government has commissioned a review of the UK’s current and future statistical needs and
the capacity to meet those needs, prompted by increasing difficulty in measuring output and
productivity and a perception that official data could be improved. An interim report, published in
December 2015, found that conventional statistical measures and methods are increasingly
challenged as the UK economy becomes more service oriented, as businesses operate more across
national borders, as digitization of economic activities increases, and the boundaries between
market and home production become more blurred. These issues are relevant to a number of
advanced and transition economies. The interim report recommends a number of specific steps,
such as greater integration of data sources and use of administrative data, addressing shortcomings
to national accounts and flow of funds measures, and improvements to UK trade, construction, and
CPI statistics. Staff welcomes these recommendations. The final report will be published by the
March 2016 Budget.

Statement by Mr. Stephen Field, Executive Director for the United Kingdom
February 12, 2016
I thank staff for a very productive mission and thorough Article IV report. My authorities
broadly agree with the staff analysis, note that staff considers the overall policy mix is
appropriate and, notwithstanding the steady growth the UK has experienced, agree with staff
that they should continue to take action to ensure the economy remains resilient to ongoing
domestic and external challenges.
Economic Outlook
As staff notes, the UK’s recent economic performance has been strong and considerable
progress has been made in addressing underlying vulnerabilities. Growth has been robust,
unemployment has fallen substantially, employment has reached a historic high, the fiscal
deficit has been reduced and financial sector resilience has increased.
The economy continues to perform strongly with the recovery becoming more broadly
entrenched. Even with the weaker global picture, staff expects growth to remain steady at
2.2 per cent this year and next. A tighter labour market and rising productivity growth is
expected to support real incomes and consumption while business investment is forecast to
grow at 7.4 per cent this year. The employment picture also continues to be positive, with
unemployment falling from a peak of 8.4 per cent in 2011 to close to 5 per cent and the
highest employment rate in the UK’s history.
Recent falls in oil and other commodity prices and weaker than anticipated wage growth (due
in part to lower realised inflation) are contributing to a slower recovery in CPI inflation. The
scale of the recent commodity price falls means that CPI inflation is likely to remain below 1
per cent until the end of the year, but it is expected to exceed the 2 per cent target slightly at
the two year point, as drags from external factors unwind and domestic cost pressures build.
Core inflation has picked up since the middle of last year and is now around its pre-crisis
average, at 1.4 per cent in the latest data, and the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) judges
that inflation expectations remain well anchored.
Risks to the outlook
Against this broadly positive economic outlook, we welcome staff analysis of a number of
key risks and challenges. These include global risks, from lower global growth and a
slowdown in emerging economies, and domestic risks, arising from the housing market and
lower than expected productivity growth.
Staff has also provided a helpful external assessment, supported by new analysis, of the
current account deficit, which in recent years has been large by historical and international
standards, and currently stands at 3.7 per cent of GDP. As the staff report notes, however,
some of the weakness in the external position is expected to be temporary and should unwind
as partner economies strengthen. Moreover, the nature of the capital flows financing the
deficit does not suggest a particular vulnerability (in addition to its size), and the external
balance sheet has become more resilient to shocks.

In a world where the global risks are increasing it remains of the utmost importance that the
Government continues to work through its plan to build resilience and better prepare the UK
for whatever lies ahead both externally and domestically. The Government’s strategy for
doing so is built on four key pillars of: monetary activism; deficit reduction; structural
reforms; and reforms to strengthen the resilience of the financial sector.
Monetary activism
Monetary policy continues to play an important role in supporting economic activity. Since
the global financial crisis, the MPC has reduced and held Bank Rate at its historically low
level of 0.5 per cent and purchased a stock of assets amounting to £375 billion. The MPC
continues to make clear that given the likely persistence of the headwinds weighing on the
economy, when Bank Rate does begin to rise, it is expected to do so only gradually and to a
level lower than in recent cycles. The actual path that Bank Rate will follow over the next
few years will depend on the economic circumstances.
Macroprudential policies and the housing market
The Financial Policy Committee (FPC) has been created with a remit to identify risks to
financial stability and has already taken action to mitigate risks emanating from the housing
market, traditionally a source of vulnerability for the UK economy, and a focus of the 2014
Article IV. In June 2014, the FPC judged that household indebtedness did not pose an
imminent threat to stability, but that it was prudent to introduce two policies to insure against
the risk of a marked loosening in underwriting standards and a further significant rise in the
number of highly indebted households. House price growth subsequently eased somewhat,
but with household debt to income still at high levels the FPC has judged that the insurance
provided by the June 2014 Recommendations remains warranted.
The FPC is now looking at buy-to-let mortgages, where lending has continued to grow. In the
year to 2015 Q3, the stock of buy-to-let lending rose by 10 per cent, compared to just
0.4 percent for lending to owner-occupiers. Assessed against relevant affordability metrics,
buy-to-let borrowers appear more vulnerable to an unexpected rise in interest rates or a fall in
income. The FPC is alert to financial stability risks arising from growth in buy-to-let
mortgage lending and has made clear that it stands ready to take action if necessary to protect
and enhance financial stability. Tax changes to the buy-to-let market announced last year are
also expected to dampen demand from buy-to-let investors, although over time some of this
may be offset by increased demand from existing and potential owner-occupiers.
The long term answer to the country’s housing problems is to build more homes and in the
Budget and Autumn Statement the Chancellor announced a doubling of the housing budget
to over £2 billion per year. As a result the UK is embarking on the biggest home-building
programme by any government since the 1970s. Further reforms to the planning system have
also been announced to improve supply, and public and commercial land is being released
for house-building.

Deficit reduction
Another key risk identified by staff is the high levels of public borrowing and debt. Reducing
the deficit has been central to the Government’s strategy since 2010, when it was set to be
11.1 per cent of national income, a peacetime record. This year it is set to fall to close to a
third of that, 3.9 per cent, but at over £70 billion this year, borrowing is still far too high. The
UK currently has the second largest fiscal deficit in the G7 as a share of national income,
alongside its large current account deficit.
The recent Spending Review sets out spending plans that will see the deficit and debt fall
every year, and we are expected to reach a surplus by the end of the Parliament. The deficit
reduction plan is based on simple rules set out in the new Charter for Budget Responsibility,
which commits the Government to reducing the debt to GDP ratio in each and every year of
this Parliament, to reaching a surplus in the year 2019-20, and to maintaining that surplus in
‘normal times’ in order to rebuild buffers. Within the new framework, the surplus rule will be
suspended if the economy is hit by a significant negative shock, defined as real GDP growth
of less than 1 per cent on a rolling 4 quarter-on-4 quarter basis. This provides flexibility to
allow the automatic stabilisers to operate freely when needed.
In line with the IMF’s Fiscal Transparency Code, the new Charter also requires the Office for
Budget Responsibility to produce a fiscal risks statement setting out the main risks to the
public finances, including macroeconomic risks and specific fiscal risks. This will be
produced at least once every 2 years, and the OBR plans to produce the first such report
within the next two years.
Structural reform
Productivity continues to be a challenge for the UK, with output per hour still 15 per cent
below its pre-crisis trend. In 2015, the government published a plan for strengthening
productivity growth over the next decade, setting out a number of concrete policy measures.
These are designed to encourage long-term investment in economic capital (including
infrastructure, skills and knowledge) and promote a more dynamic economy that encourages
innovation and helps resources flow to their most productive use. The government is also
committed to boosting productivity by investing in human capital. A new Apprenticeship
Levy was announced in the summer Budget of 2015 that will come into effect in April 2017,
and the government has committed to an additional 3 million apprenticeships in England by
2020.
At the end of 2015, the government set up the National Infrastructure Commission to
determine Britain’s infrastructure priorities and hold governments to account for their
delivery. The Commission will produce a report at the start of each five-year Parliament,
offering recommendations for priority infrastructure projects. At the Spending Review the
Government also committed £100 billion of spending by 2020 for new roads, rail, flood
defences and other vital projects.

Reform of the Financial System
The resilience of the banking system had continued to strengthen in recent years, reflecting
the introduction of higher regulatory requirements. The aggregate Tier 1 capital position of
major UK banks was 13 per cent of risk-weighted assets in September 2015. In its most
recent stress test, the Bank of England assessed the resilience of the banking sector to a
deterioration in global financial market conditions and the macroeconomic environment,
including in emerging market economies. The stress-test results and banks’ capital plans,
taken together, indicate that the banking system would have the capacity to maintain its core
functions, notably lending capacity, in a stress scenario.
The FPC has judged that the appropriate equity requirement for the banking system was
broadly in line with internationally agreed Basel III requirements, which would be fully
phased in by 2019, and has clarified that it is therefore not seeking further structural increases
in capital requirements for the system as a whole. The FPC has also announced its intention
to make active use of the time-varying countercyclical capital buffer that will apply to banks’
UK exposures, and is actively considering the appropriate setting.
The Fair and Effective Markets Review was established in June 2014, to conduct a
comprehensive and forward-looking assessment of the way wholesale financial markets
operate, help to restore trust in those markets in the wake of a number of recent high profile
abuses and influence the international debate on trading practices. In June 2015, the review
published its final report and the recommendations are currently being taken forward.
Looking ahead staff is currently undertaking the UK’s Financial Sector Assessment Program
that is expected to come to the Board in July 2016.
EU membership
As staff highlight in the report, the UK is currently seeking reforms to address the concerns
of the British people over its membership of the European Union. A date for a referendum
will be set as soon as the Prime Minister gets a substantial agreement for reform in the EU,
and will be at the latest by the end of 2017. We welcome the Managing Director’s
commitment to look at this issue in more detail in the 2016 Article IV.
