STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION,
SEVENTH REVIEW UNDER THE STAND-BY ARRANGEMENT
AND FINANCING ASSURANCES REVIEW, REQUEST FOR
WAIVER OF NONOBSERVANCE OF PERFORMANCE
CRITERION AND REQUEST FOR WAIVER OF APPLICABILITY

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Context. In response to the severe effects of the global financial crisis, the Executive
Board approved a 36-month Stand-By Arrangement on June 7, 2010, to support fiscal
adjustment, debt restructuring, the reduction of arrears and flow relief, and fiscal and
financial structural reforms. The first review was completed on October 29, 2010, the
combined second and third review was completed on March 30, 2011, and the
combined fourth, fifth, and sixth review was completed on June 1, 2012.
Economic developments. After three years of contraction the economy is expected to
grow by 1 percent in 2012 led by construction and tourist arrivals. Inflation rose to over
5 percent yoy in early 2012 due to the lagged effect of high oil and food prices, but fell
to 3½ percent yoy in July, consistent with a year-end projection of 3 percent. The
current account deficit is expected to widen marginally to 11½ percent of GDP in 2012
as domestic demand recovers, but will remain well below pre-crisis levels.
Program review. All quantitative performance criteria for end-June were met, except
for the continuous performance criterion on external arrears which was missed by a
small amount due to a temporary delay in payments. Available information indicates
that the authorities are on track to meet the performance criteria for end-September.
Appraisal. The authorities continue to show strong commitment to their fiscal
consolidation program. Based on generally satisfactory performance under the macroprogram, staff supports the completion of the seventh review and financing assurances
review under the Stand-By Arrangement. Risks to the program remain substantial,
including to the implementation of structural reforms for which the authorities face
capacity constraints and political resistance.

Article IV consultation. The last Article IV consultation was concluded on
June 7, 2010. The staff report and summing up of the Executive Director’s discussion
and policy recommendations are available at: Country Report No. 10/279. The
recommendations are embedded in the current program and staff has reported on
progress in program reviews. Antigua and Barbuda has accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions
on making payments and transfers for current international transactions.
Data provision. Data provision is adequate for surveillance and program monitoring,
although significant areas for improvement remain.

CONTEXT
1.
A 36-month Stand-By Arrangement for 600 percent of quota was approved by the IMF
Executive Board on June 7, 2010. The program was requested in response to a looming fiscal crisis
precipitated by large fiscal deficits and a rapid increase in debt in the run-up to the international
financial crisis. The main goals were fiscal consolidation and debt restructuring to bring public sector
debt to a more sustainable level, and structural reforms to strengthen the fiscal position and address
financial sector vulnerabilities.
2.
Performance under the program has been affected by financial sector problems.
Significant progress has been achieved in debt restructuring, and fiscal consolidation has moved
forward, despite some challenges. The first review was concluded as expected on October 29, 2010.
The second review was delayed due to the need to assess the condition of an indigenous bank, and
was completed in conjunction with the third review on March 30, 2011. The fourth, fifth, and sixth
reviews were delayed after the intervention of an indigenous bank (ABIB) by the Eastern Caribbean
Central Bank (ECCB) in July 2011, which led to uncertainty about the cost of resolution and its
implications for the fiscal program. The three reviews were completed together on June 1, 2012, and
the program was revised to include a pessimistic scenario for the cost of resolution and an adjustor
for the fiscal program, should the cost turn out to be different. The revised program also placed a
greater emphasis on structural measures in the financial sector and lowered access to 500 percent of
quota, in line with a reduced balance of payments financing need.

ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS

consumption rising by 3½ percent. Based on
these indicators staff maintains its projection for real GDP growth of 1 percent for the year.
4.
Headline inflation has been trending down after a high of 5½ percent in January 2012
due to the lagged effect of high food and fuel prices. Core inflation also rose early in 2012 due
to one-off adjustments in core categories (mainly medical and education services), but has
decelerated in recent months. In July, headline inflation fell to 3½ percent yoy while core inflation

5

ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA

was 2½ percent yoy. CPI inflation is expected to end the year at around 3 percent, as the projected
decline in international oil prices is expected to more than offset the effect of higher imported food
prices.
5.
The current account deficit is expected to widen in 2012 as domestic demand and
external financing recover. Preliminary data suggest that the CIF value of imports (including
imports for re-export) rose by 7 percent in the first half of the year, while tourism receipts rose by
5 percent. The current account deficit is expected to widen to 11½ percent of GDP in 2012
compared to 10¾ percent in 2011. Although imported food prices are expected to rise in 2012, their
effect on the current account deficit is expected to be more than offset by a decline in imported fuel
prices.
6.
A weak economy continues to weigh on bank balance sheets. Deposits remained broadly
unchanged in the first half of the year, and

conservatorship of the ECCB―is well above the regulatory minimum of 8 percent.
7.
The current political environment is relatively calm although aggressive policy
implementation is constrained. The ruling United Progressive Party (UPP) has 9 of the 17 seats in
the House of Representatives, and the support of the Barbuda People's Movement (BPM), which has
1 seat. However, this majority is not sufficient to push through difficult reform measures, especially
as the next general election nears. A no-confidence motion against the Prime Minister was filed by
the opposition Antigua Labor Party (ALP) in May 2012, but never debated. National elections take
place on a 5-year cycle and the next one is constitutionally due by April 2014.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
8.
An illustrative medium-term scenario envisions a return to a conservative
medium-term growth path by 2015. After a gradual recovery in 2012–13, real GDP is expected to
return to a conservative long-term historical trend of between 3 and 3½ percent growth per annum,
predicated on an improving external environment (although still below the level before the crisis)
and a return of tourism and investment activity. Consumer price inflation is expected to trend down
to around 3 percent, close to trading partner inflation, assuming stable international commodity
prices and a continuation of the fixed peg to the US dollar. Fiscal policy is assumed to continue to
be oriented to reaching a target ratio of debt-to-GDP of 60 percent by 2020. Under current
6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA

assumptions about the cost of the ABIB resolution, this would require a primary surplus of
3½ percent of GDP in 2013 and beyond, consistent with an overall fiscal surplus of 0.6–0.8 percent
of GDP. This would lead to a decline in the ratio of debt-to-GDP from close to 100 percent in 2012
in this scenario, to 76 percent in 2016. The current account deficit is expected to widen with
increased domestic demand related to a recovery in private investment and tourism activity, but to
remain somewhat below historical levels due to the higher level of public savings and the relative
scarcity of external financing after the program concludes in 2013.

However, risks are predominantly to the downside.1


Growth may turn out to be lower than expected. A deepening of the euro-zone
crisis and a slowdown in advanced economies could continue to affect main tourism
markets and sources of foreign direct investment.



Fiscal consolidation and debt sustainability remain a challenge. The fiscal and
debt paths depend critically on the sustained implementation of reforms in revenue
administration and public financial management, which are facing some obstacles.
There is also a risk that contingent liabilities for the public sector (including in
statutory bodies and the financial sector) could continue to materialize, further
eroding the fiscal position and constraining public investment.



The financial sector remains weak. Additional shocks to the already weakened
balance sheets of commercial banks could put stress on the financial system, and
lead to a loss of confidence in the system and the economy.



The economy is very vulnerable to terms of trade shocks. An increase in oil and
food prices or other terms of trade shocks could put further pressure on the balance
of payments, international financing and inflation. The economy is highly dependent

on imports, although a move to diversify production to agricultural products may
mitigate somewhat the effects of imported food prices.


The probability of a natural disaster is higher than in most other countries.
According to data from the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Natural
Disasters, a natural disaster inflicting damage equivalent to 2 percent of a country’s
GDP can be expected to hit one of the countries in the ECCU roughly once every
2½ years.

PROGRAM PERFORMANCE AND REVIEW
A. ABIB Resolution and Financial Sector Measures
10.
Progress on the resolution of ABIB has been slower than expected. The authorities are
waiting for the valuation update to be concluded so that the purchase and assumption transaction
can take place. The ECCB received the first draft of the report in early October, and the process for
the transfer of assets was expected to begin shortly thereafter. Since the intervention, a number of
resolution options have been considered; the current plan is to establish a holding company to own
the new bank that will result from the purchase and assumption transaction.2 An external consultant
and the shareholders of the new bank have begun preparing the business plan that will be
submitted for the licensing process. The authorities expect the new bank to be licensed and begin
operation by the end of November, 2012.
11.
An asset management company (AMC) which will dispose of the impaired assets of
ABIB has been incorporated by the government, but is not yet staffed and operational. The
authorities prefer to wait for the resolution process before bringing the company into full operation.
A board of directors has been identified, from which a managing director will be selected. An
external consultant is working with the authorities to address any legal and funding issues, although
no challenges are expected.
12.
There has been limited progress on the completion of other financial sector
benchmarks:


Provision of a strategic plan for the new bank (August 2012 - delayed). The submission
of a strategic business plan for the new bank under the licensing process is expected in late
October, in line with the timetable for resolution.



Provision of a strategic plan for restructuring the indigenous banks in Antigua and
Barbuda (August 2012 – delayed). The ECCB has presented the outline of a plan for the
consolidation of the indigenous banks in the ECCU in which the consolidation of the
indigenous banks in Antigua and Barbuda is the first step. However, this outline provides few

National Bank of Dominica; Bank of St. Vincent and the Grenadines; and the Government of Antigua and Barbuda.

specifics on how the process will be carried out. In particular, the strategic plan needs to be
developed to address: (a) how the mergers of private institutions would be managed; and
(b) the conduct of a comprehensive assessment of the balance sheets of the banks to be
merged, so that these can be cleaned up and any deficiency in capital made up by
shareholders.


Conducting on-site full scope examinations of remaining indigenous banks
(August 2012 - completed). The ECCB completed these examinations in July, and the
results confirm the information generated by the Task Force on the ECCU Financial System.3

B. Fiscal Policy
13.

The fiscal outturn for the first half of 2012 was in line with the program.


Revenue. The revenue objectives under the program were broadly met. Tax revenue
increased by 9 percent in nominal terms compared to the first half of 2011. Taxes on
domestic transactions over-performed, while customs revenue lagged. Stamp duties more
than tripled compared to the first half of 2011 due to a large one-off real estate transaction
in February, and revenue from the Antigua and Barbuda Sales Tax (ABST) revenue increased
by 8 percent. However, taxes on international transactions remained flat in nominal terms
and fell as a percent of the CIF value of imports.



Expenditure. Current expenditure was higher than envisaged under the program by
0.7 percent of GDP, due to unexpected one-off payments on wage settlements and
compensation indemnities (0.4 percent of GDP) related to a legal claim, and unexpected
transfers to statutory bodies. These transfers were made to cover external debt payments
guaranteed by the central government (0.2 percent of GDP for Antigua Public Utilities
Authority (APUA) and St. John’s Development Corporation) and operational costs for the
Antigua and Barbuda Port Authority (0.1 percent of GDP). To compensate for the higher
current expenditure, capital expenditure was cut well below program levels (by 0.5 percent
of GDP). Interest payments were also lower due to favorable exchange rate movements and
some liability management operations on domestic debt.



Overall balance. The performance criterion on the overall balance was met. The outcome
was a deficit of EC$16 million (0.5 percent of GDP), in line to meet the end-September
performance criterion of a EC$32 million deficit (1 percent of GDP).



Primary balance. The indicative target on the primary balance was missed by a margin of
EC$8 million (0.3 percent of GDP), as the savings on interest payments were used to

The Task Force on the ECCU Financial System was set up by the Monetary Council of the ECCU in October 2011. It is
chaired by the Governor of the ECCB and comprises senior staff of the ECCB, Ministries of Finance of the ECCU
countries, and staff from the Caribbean Development Bank, International Monetary Fund and World Bank. Its main
task to date has been to conduct a diagnostic analysis of the ECCU financial system and prepare a comprehensive
strategy for reform.

accommodate part of the larger than programmed current expenditure. Despite this
slippage the authorities expect to meet their end-September primary balance target.
14.
Performance criteria on external debt and domestic arrears were met, although the
continuous performance criterion on external debt arrears was missed. Arrears of EC$1 million
were accumulated on a payment to the Caribbean Development Bank due in June, but these were
cleared by early July. A waiver is being requested on the basis that the nonobservance was minor
and temporary and has been corrected.

Preliminary numbers indicate that the performance criteria for end-September are
expected to be met. Revenue performance continues improving with total revenue collected at the
Inland Revenue Department (IRD) up 18.4 percent in nominal terms in January-August 2012 over the
same period in 2011, while Customs and Excise Department (CED) revenue is up 6.2 percent over the
same period. Data on expenditure and financing are only available with a six-week lag, and a
supplement will be provided on end-August performance before the Board meeting. The seasonality
of the deficit targets allows the authorities twice the space in the third quarter (with a total deficit of
EC$16 million) as in the first two quarters (with a deficit of EC$8 million in each).
16.
The fiscal position is expected to deteriorate significantly this year reflecting the costs
of resolution of ABIB (Figure 2). The underlying overall balance (excluding resolution costs) is
expected to be in deficit by 1.3 percent of GDP, consistent with an underlying primary surplus of
1.7 percent of GDP. The resolution of ABIB will require the issuance of a bond to recapitalize the new
bank, which could be as large as 10.7 percent of GDP (EC$340 million) in the program’s baseline
scenario, bringing the overall deficit to 12 percent of GDP and the primary balance to a deficit of
9 percent of GDP.
17.
The issuance of a recapitalization bond will result in a significant increase in the public
and publicly guaranteed debt. The underlying debt ratio (excluding ABIB resolution costs) is
expected to decline from 93 percent in 2011 to 87 percent in 2012 due to the effects of nominal
GDP growth and a debt restructuring worth EC$101 million (about 3.2 percent of GDP). However,
the issuance of a recapitalization bond would bring the debt ratio back up to 98 percent of GDP.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA

18.
As discussed in the last staff report, for 2013, the fiscal program puts in place the
average primary surplus necessary to reach the debt target of 60 percent of GDP in 2020.
Given prudent assumptions for growth, inflation and nominal interest rates (see DSA appendix), staff
and authorities agree that an average primary surplus of 3½ percent of GDP over the period from
2013 to 2020 would bring the debt to GDP ratio down to the target of 60 percent. The overall
balance consistent with this primary balance surplus implies targeting a budget surplus of
0.6 percent of GDP in 2013.


Revenues. Tax revenues are projected to increase to 21.3 percent of GDP in 2013 from
19.6 percent of GDP in 2012. The projection assumes an increase of 1½ percent of GDP
based on additional measures and the expected yields from structural reforms being
supported by technical assistance. Non-tax and capital revenue is maintained at the same
nominal level as in 2012, but grants are estimated to be much higher in 2013, reaching
EC$25 million, mainly from capital donations for airport construction. The authorities will
implement additional measures amounting to EC$50.2 million (1½ percent of GDP) if
necessary to achieve the targeted primary surplus. These measures would be sufficient to
reach a primary surplus of 4 percent of GDP in 2013.



Expenditure. Primary current expenditure is projected to fall again to 16.8 percent of GDP in
2013 from 18 percent of GDP in 2012, reflecting a nominal freeze in most headline
categories, and lower transfers. Capital expenditure is projected to be 3.1 percent of GDP,
more than double the level in 2011 to make up for compressed levels of investment in
previous years. The authorities have signaled that any additional fiscal space in 2013 and
beyond that might result from a lower outcome of the recapitalization bond would be used
for public investments in infrastructure including refurbishing roads and equipment at the
Port Authority.

19.
A symmetric adjustor will allow for a revision of the fiscal targets for 2013 if the size of
the recapitalization bond were to be different from EC$340 million. The adjustor is based on a
simple linear formula to maintain consistency with implementing the average primary balance
necessary to reach the debt target by 2020. The adjustor would lower the primary surplus to
2.6 percent of GDP in the most optimistic case consistent with a recapitalization bond of
EC$150 million (4.7 percent of GDP). In all cases the adjusted target for the performance criterion
would be set in nominal terms as the overall balance consistent with the primary balance surplus
calculated in the adjustor minus interest payments.

C. Structural Reforms
20.
Progress on the fiscal reform agenda has also been limited, although there has been
progress in the Inland Revenue Department (IRD). The Minister of Finance is committed to the
overall reform, despite some political resistance and delays in the Customs and Excise Department
(CED).

garnishing of taxes has been folded into this legislation, which is expected to receive its
second and third readings in parliament in October and November 2012. The full law would
not come into effect until January 1, 2013.



Compliance of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) with tax obligations (June 2012 –
delayed). Compliance has been confirmed for 12 SOEs by end-August and three more are
expected to enter into compliance by end-October. The largest SOEs are in compliance, and
most are in compliance with monthly obligations, though late on their obligations for annual
filing.



Compliance of 40 percent of professionals with tax obligations (September 2012 delayed). IRD has not met this benchmark, although compliance has improved considerably.
Compliance for chartered accountants has been increased to 60 percent at end-September,
and the IRD is working on increasing compliance of lawyers (historically around 20 percent)
and medical professionals at the Mount St. John’s Medical Center to 40 percent by
December 2012.



Valuation/compliance audit on petroleum imports (June 2012 – delayed). The
Comptroller of Customs and Excise has been reticent to implement the audit, but agreed to
do it with the benefit of technical assistance beginning in September 2012, to be concluded
by early November 2012.



Implementation of the HS 2007 code in customs (June 2012 – delayed). The
implementation of the code will allow for a much clearer classification of imports for the
purpose of assessing valuation and duties. It has been approved but has not been gazetted
due to a strike at the government’s printing press. The code is expected to be gazetted and
fully implemented by end-October 2012.



Presentation and passage of New Customs Act (September 2012 - delayed). The
Customs Act was ready to be sent to parliament by end-September, but awaits the
completion of an explanatory memorandum before it can proceed to parliament. It is
expected to be passed by end-October.



Completion of a tax expenditure study (September 2012 - delayed). A recent technical
assistance report (June 2012) determined that collections could be as low as 30 percent of
potential, mainly due to concessions, exemptions and tax incentives. The regime for tax
exemptions gives discretion to Ministers to grant exemptions. With technical assistance on
the ground in September, the authorities agreed that a tax expenditure study will be

concluded by end-October 2012 with a view to designing a strategy for the reform of tax
expenditures.
21.
Public financial management and civil service reforms have also been delayed. A draft
of the revised public service legislation has been completed, but the other three benchmarks in this
area due before end-September are likely to be delayed (see Table 2).

D. Debt Management
22.
Following the multilateral agreement with the Paris Club, the bilateral agreement with
Brazil remains to be ratified, while discussions with non-Paris Club creditors for restructuring
on comparable terms continue. Agreements with Trinidad and Tobago and Kuwait remain
outstanding but the government is making best efforts to pursue negotiation. Negotiations with the
two remaining external private creditors are also ongoing and the government is making good faith
efforts to conclude them as soon as possible. The government is also pursuing a debt for nature
swap with Brazil.4 On the domestic side, the government has successfully completed four Treasury
bill issues on the Regional Government Securities Market (RGSM) for EC$47.6 million, which it
intends to use to pay down arrears and overdrafts with domestic creditors and roll over some of its
existing RGSM liabilities. This is part of the government’s initiative to maintain activity on the RGSM,
creating a track record of regular issuance and repayment.

MEDIUM-TERM POLICY DISCUSSIONS
23.
Antigua and Barbuda faces a number of important policy choices to restore growth
and secure macroeconomic stability in the medium term. Staff held discussions with authorities,
private sector and members of civil society on three broad medium-term policy issues: growth and
improving competitiveness; fiscal consolidation and debt sustainability; and financial stability.

A. Growth and Competitiveness
24.
Growth has been declining for some years, even before the crisis. As in other ECCU
countries, this reflects the small size and lack of diversification of the economy, as well as its
openness and vulnerability to external shocks. Tourism drives over 60–70 percent of economic
activity, with the remaining 30–40 percent attributed mostly to government and financial services.
During the current crisis, the strong decline in tourism source markets, a contraction in government
services and weakness in the local banking sector have contributed to a precipitous fall in real
output. Antigua and Barbuda has also lost competitiveness in the tourism industry, while real
expenditure per tourist has declined (Box 1).

4

In the model being considered, The Nature Conservancy (TNC) would purchase outstanding debt of Antigua and
Barbuda to Brazil at a discount, and in return the Government of Antigua and Barbuda would fund a conservation
trust to finance projects related to climate adaptation and marine ecosystem preservation.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA

25.
Weak output growth and a declining share of the Caribbean tourist market point to a
loss in competitiveness (Box 2). REER measures suggest a modest loss of competitiveness from
2008, and unit labor costs, the highest in the ECCU in 2010, are rising as productivity has fallen more
rapidly than real wages. CGER estimates point to an overvaluation of the REER, ranging from
6.7 percent (macro balance approach) to 15.8 percent (external sustainability approach).
26.
The mission discussed policies for boosting medium-term growth and
competitiveness:


Raising productivity in the public sector. The authorities recognized that the productivity
of public workers needs to be improved, particularly since the public sector is the largest
employer and civil service employment is a benchmark for other parts of the economy. The
government has already implemented a wage and hiring freeze in the central government,
but the civil service remains fragmented, and contains a large number of non-established
employees, generally free from strict controls over benefits and accountability provisions.
The mission emphasized the importance of including a provision for the unification of the
civil service in the forthcoming draft Public Service Act.



Measures to improve structural competitiveness:
o

14

Labor market reform is important. Labor market rigidities, particularly the
ability to hire temporary or seasonal workers, are cited by the private sector as
an impediment to competitiveness. In addition, minimum wages are high relative
to other Caribbean tourism destinations. A first step would be improving labor
market statistics, which are nonexistent in Antigua and Barbuda. The authorities
indicated they will begin a new harmonized labor force survey in 2013,
implemented on an annual basis with other ECCU countries. A harmonized labor
code across the ECCU could also level the regulatory playing field, but the
authorities indicated this would be politically challenging. Although they agreed
on the need to improve labor productivity, the authorities saw little scope for
traditional fiscal devaluation policies (a more broad based and lower labor tax
accompanied by a VAT increase) as labor taxes are already low.

tourism shock faced by the island. All told, about
three-quarters of the economic contraction in Antigua and Barbuda from 2009–11 is estimated to have
come from the slowdown of tourism related subsectors.

The crisis changed the composition of tourists going to Antigua and Barbuda. The US has overtaken
the UK as the largest source market, with its share of arrivals growing from 30 to 35 percent between 2007
and 2011, while the UK’s share dropped from 37 to 28 percent. There was also a slight drop in the share of
Caribbean visitors, from 18 to 15 percent. The most notable development was the rise in the share of
Canadian tourists, which more than doubled, from 4 percent in 2007 to 10 percent in 2011—a testament to
the strong recovery of the Canadian economy.
The change in tourist composition has had a
negative impact on tourist expenditures, which
were already on the decline. Real expenditure per
tourist fell by 19 percent from 1999–2011, in contrast
to the global trend. Visitors from the UK were
typically known to yield the most receipts per tourist
as they stayed at relatively high tier accommodations
for relatively longer periods of time (two weeks, on
average). US tourists, who have taken over as the
largest market segment, typically stay for shorter
periods, while Canadian tourists, the most rapidly
growing segment, are also known to yield less per
visitor due to lower-tier accommodations and shorter
stays.

Antigua and Barbuda lost some exchange rate
competitiveness in the past four years, although
the REER is still below its 2005 level. Nominal and
real effective exchange rates have been appreciating
since mid 2008. The NEER appreciated by some 20
percent, largely reflecting the appreciation of the US
dollar vis-à-vis other trade partners (principally
Europe). With inflation in Antigua and Barbuda below
that of its trade partners, the REER appreciated by
some 15 percent since 2008.

Alternative REER measures also point to a loss in
competitiveness. Tourist competitor- and customer-based real exchange rates diverged since 2008, with
the competitor-based rate appreciating by over 15 percent and the customer-based rate fluctuating around
2008 levels. Decomposing competitor- and customer-based rates reveals that Antigua and Barbuda is losing
competitiveness vis-à-vis other ECCU countries and the UK (traditionally its largest tourist source market)
since 2009.
Rising unit labor costs (ULCs) contributed to the erosion of price competitiveness. ULCs rose by an
estimated 15 percent since 2008 as output contracted by more than real wages and employment. While the
rise in ULCs looks modest compared to other ECCU countries, the level of ULCs in Antigua and Barbuda is
already the highest in the ECCU. However, these numbers must be treated with caution as the underlying
data are based on different sources and coverage.1
CGER estimates consistently indicate that the REER is overvalued, underscoring the need to improve
price competitiveness. The Macro-Balance (MB) and External-Sustainability (ES) approaches yield estimates



Improving the business climate is also important. While Antigua and
Barbuda’s ranking in the World Bank’s Doing Business Indicators is high relative
to the rest of the Caribbean, it has been deteriorating since 2006, and particular
weaknesses are related to cross-border trading, tax administration and the cost
of electricity. Ongoing reforms in the Inland Revenue Department and the
Customs and Excise Department, including the introduction of codes of conduct
and greater transparency and efficiency in operations could help reduce the cost
of doing business. In addition, the authorities agreed that significant reforms in
the Antigua Public Utilities Authority along with other statutory bodies could
improve the provision of essential services such as electricity and transport.

Economic diversification. The government has put a renewed emphasis on agriculture,
including incentives for fruit and vegetable production and a large poultry project. Other
projects include the sub-region’s first comprehensive cancer treatment center, and sports
tourism.

B. Fiscal Consolidation and Debt Sustainability
27.
The high level of public debt presents a challenge to macroeconomic management.
There is little space for cushioning shocks in an economy that has a high level of external
vulnerability and for which fiscal policy is the only instrument for macroeconomic management. It is
thus critical to reduce debt and recapture fiscal policy space through rationalizing expenditure and
reforms in public sector financial management. There are considerable downside risks for fiscal
consolidation going forward including contingent liabilities from further distress in the banking
system, or hidden liabilities in the state owned enterprises (SOEs) (Box 3).
28.

The mission discussed possible measures to reduce risks in four different areas:


Expenditure Rationalization and Structural Reforms. The authorities agreed that it would
be important to explore the feasibility of savings in current spending, including from more
targeted subsidies and transfers, rationalizing public benefit packages, and improving
government services through outsourcing, amalgamating departments, and forming a single
civil service. They also agreed that sustained implementation of current revenue
administration, public financial management and macro-financial planning reforms
under the EU program will be key to maintain momentum on fiscal consolidation. Enhancing
capacity and institutionalizing reforms will be critical to making gains sustainable.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Box 3. Contingent Liabilities from SOEs are a Major Source of Fiscal Risk
Antigua and Barbuda has 28 SOEs which account
for a significant amount of public employment
and spending. At end-2009, employment in SOEs
was equivalent to slightly less than one half of
employment in the central government, and their
expenditures were equivalent to 40 percent of the
central government budget’s primary spending.
Expenditures of SOEs are partly funded by transfers
from the budget, which grew from about 2.1 percent
of GDP in 2010 to almost 5 percent in 2011, but they
can also access financing from domestic banks
(though often only with a government guarantee).

Services

Pensions
10%
Transfers

The financial information of SOEs is often incomplete and not sufficiently reliable to provide a timely
and accurate assessment of the fiscal risk from this source. Most SOEs do not fully comply with the
reporting requirements of the Financial Administration Act (FAA). Only 12 out of the 28 SOEs reported
financial information in 2010. Available information mostly relates to the budget of the entities, but detailed
execution information on revenues, expenditures and reconciliation with financing is absent for most SOEs.
The quality of available information is also dubious as audited statements have a lag of four to five years and
have not been submitted to the parliament as required by the FAA.
Oversight, governance and risk management of the SOEs is weak. Currently there is no SOE oversight
unit in the Ministry of Finance to monitor the financial situation and potential contingent liabilities of SOEs.
The existing oversight and governance regime is inadequate for enforcing a hard budget constraint on the
SOEs and ensuring that resources are used in a cost-effective manner, safeguarding the budget from
contingent liabilities (including running arrears).
Several SOEs are currently experiencing financial difficulties. In early 2012, the Antigua and Barbuda
Public Utilities Authority (APUA) and St. John’s Development Corporation (SJDC) faced debt defaults and the
government had to make transfers to service the loans guaranteed by the government. In June 2012,
Antigua Port Authority (APA) failed to pay wages on time which triggered a strike by the workers and
required additional unexpected transfers from the central government. In addition, the finances of Antigua
and Barbuda Social Security Board (ABSSB) have deteriorated significantly since 2007 and the national
pension scheme is unsustainable under current parameters, despite a relatively favorable dependency ratio.
The contingent liabilities from SOEs pose significant fiscal risks for the government. By end-2011, the
government’s guaranteed debt of SOEs amounted to 15.7 percent of the total public sector debt
(14.6 percent of GDP). More seriously, ABSSB has been running cash deficits since 2007 and is projected to
run losses in 2019 with its reserves depleted by 2029 if no action is taken. The actuarial deficit over
2009–50 was estimated to be 151 percent of GDP according to the June 2010 FAD TA report.



Tax reform. Authorities agreed that broadening the tax base by eliminating exemptions
would be a good way to enhance revenue, and acknowledged the importance of carrying
out a tax expenditure study under the program to identify possible reforms.



SOE oversight and reform. The authorities agreed that the structural benchmarks under the
program (Set up an oversight, institutional and reporting framework for SOEs, due in
December 2012, and commence reviews of selected SOEs to assess fiscal risks, due in
January 2013) would be important to begin to address financial risks from SOEs.



Parametric reforms in the pension system. These are needed to ensure the sustainability
of the pension schemes and minimize the fiscal costs. The social security system is not
sustainable under current parameters. An IMF TA mission in June 2010 found the social
security system has been running cash deficits since 2007 despite a favorable dependency
ratio. Staff recommended raising the contribution rate, increasing the retirement age, and
changing the formula for calculating pensionable earnings. Similar measures were also
recommended for the non-contributory civil service pension scheme. The authorities have
established a Pension Modernization Commission to pursue reforms and are exploring
seeking further technical assistance in this area.

C. Financial Sector Stability
29.
The diagnostic work of the Task Force on the ECCU Financial System has brought to
light weaknesses in the banking sector and supervision (Box 4).5 The mission discussed two
areas of vulnerability:


Offshore banks and non-bank financial institutions. The Financial Services Regulatory
Commission (FSRC) is an organ of the Government of Antigua and Barbuda that oversees
the offshore banks and other non-bank financial institutions. The FSRC has undergone
significant reform in recent years and the authorities are set to present new legislation to
parliament to govern the FSRC by December as a structural benchmark under the program.
Staff voiced a strong concern about the need for a more coordinated approach to
supervision that takes into account possible links between off-shore institutions and the
domestic financial system. Staff recommended that consolidated supervision be put in place
or that contemporaneous examinations of linked offshore and onshore entities be
conducted.



Banking supervision and regulatory reform. The mission discussed the need for the
introduction of consolidated supervision, and inquired about the status of plans for
improvements in the regulations for asset classification and loan loss provisioning, tighter
prudential regulations and the introduction of risk-based supervision. The mission also

Box 4. Recent Bank Failures Point to the Need for Reform
Antigua and Barbuda has the largest financial sector in the ECCU, in absolute terms and relative to GDP.
With EC$ 8.8 billion in assets (292 percent of GDP), Antigua and Barbuda’s financial system is deep relative to the
size of the economy and highly monetized (the ratio of M2 to GDP was around 98 percent in 2011). Commercial
banks dominate the financial system, accounting for 61 percent of total assets, but Antigua also has the largest
offshore financial center in the ECCU. The sector is highly interconnected, and the Government of Antigua and
Barbuda is closely linked to the country’s indigenous banks, both in terms of credit and deposit exposures as well
as through a significant ownership stake in one of
the institutions (ECAB).
Monetary Council
Ministry of Finance
Regulation and supervision of the financial
sector is shared by the government and the
ECCB. The ECCB is responsible for the regulation
and supervision of commercial banks (domestic
and foreign) in Antigua and Barbuda and the rest
of the ECCU. The regulation and supervision of
the rest of the financial system, including the
offshore center and all domestic non-bank
financial institutions, is the responsibility of an
independent regulatory body called the Financial
Services Regulatory Commission (FSRC).

Antigua and Barbuda’s indigenous banks were hit hard by the global financial crisis. NPLs of indigenous and
foreign banks have been rising since 2009 while the level of provisioning for loan losses at the indigenous banks is
relatively low. In addition, liquidity at some of the indigenous banks has tightened significantly. The combination
of rising credit risk and tighter liquidity has had negative consequences for profitability, with the return on assets
for indigenous banks falling from 2.4 percent in 2007 to 0.2 percent in 2011.
The recent failures of two indigenous banks offer important lessons for reform in the regulatory and
supervisory framework. The failures of the Bank of Antigua and ABIB (in 2009 and 2011, respectively) revealed
challenges in supervision of commercial banks—including infrequent onsite examinations and weak enforcement
of corrective actions for noncompliance. The failures also revealed the need for closer coordination between the
ECCB and FSRC and for consolidated supervision of financial conglomerates, as well as for a proper resolution
framework with well defined participants, procedures, roles and responsibilities.
Addressing the weaknesses in the supervisory and regulatory framework is a critical priority. There is a need
to update and modernize the Banking Act and regulations, including to revise and strengthen regulations for asset
classification and provisioning, tighten regulations for capital adequacy, and develop a proper resolution
framework for failed institutions. In addition, more frequent, risk-based and consolidated supervision will be
essential going forward, given the interconnectedness of the system and the existence of financial conglomerates.
Finally, the recent bank failures also point to the need to eventually establish some form of deposit insurance and
to strengthen AML/CFT supervision.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA

discussed the need to change the legal framework to allow for stronger corrective action
and enforcement on the part of supervisors and continue to improve the AML/CFT
supervisory framework in line with the action plan agreed with the Financial Action Task
Force. The authorities acknowledged the need for changes in regulations and the legal
framework but pointed out that these initiatives have to be implemented on an ECCU-wide
basis and would require significant coordination across different countries. Actions that
could be taken immediately include increasing the frequency of on-site examinations with a
specific focus on consolidated supervision, and revising regulations for asset classification
and loan loss provisioning.

PROGRAM ISSUES
30.
A revised Letter of Intent (LOI), Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
(MEFP) and Technical Memorandum of Understandings (TMU) are attached. There are no
significant revisions and the authorities’ program continues to be guided by the LOI and MEFP of
May 2012.
31.
Full implementation of the program should ensure Antigua and Barbuda’s capacity to
repay the Fund in a timely manner. Outstanding credit to the Fund reached 3.7 percent of GDP in
2011 and is expected to peak at 8 percent of GDP in 2013 (Table 12). Debt service to the Fund is
expected to peak at 1.9 percent of GDP and 3.7 percent of exports of goods and services in 2016
and decline thereafter. An update safeguards assessment of the ECCB was completed in April 2012
in accordance with the four year cycle of assessment applicable to regional central banks under the
safeguard policy. No significant safeguards risks were identified.

STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
The authorities continue to show strong commitment to their fiscal consolidation
program, despite the need for more progress in customs. They met most of the performance
criteria under the program and are on track to meet their overall fiscal balance target for the year.
The continuous performance criterion on external debt arrears was missed by a very small amount
and the arrears were cleared quickly. There are signs of a gradual recovery in the economy after
three years of contraction and inflation remains contained, which should help consolidation efforts
going forward.
33.
Progress on revenue reform has been mixed. The authorities met their revenue goals for
the first half of the year, partly through a large one-off transaction in real estate, but also because
reforms in tax collection on the ABST and other domestic taxes have begun to take hold. However
collection of taxes on international transactions remained flat, and fell per unit of CIF imports.
34.
The materialization of contingent liabilities is affecting the fiscal outcome. While the
authorities met their target on the overall balance, they had to compensate for an increase in
current expenditure related to higher transfers to statutory bodies and one-off wage and benefits
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA

payments related to an adverse judgment on settlements and compensation indemnities. The
authorities should work to quantify risks from contingent liabilities more carefully in the context of
setting up a macro fiscal unit within the Ministry of Finance and improving oversight and reporting
of state-owned enterprises. There is also a need to make decisive efforts to modernize the public
pension system.
35.
The pattern of adjustment continues to be less than desirable. Current primary
expenditure overruns with respect to the program have been compensated by lower capital
spending, continuing a pattern begun in 2011. The authorities should work to secure space for
much-needed capital spending going forward by implementing expenditure rationalization and
structural reforms.
36.
The authorities should be commended for their debt management efforts. On the
external front, they continue to pursue debt renegotiations which will help ease the debt burden. On
the domestic front, debt management efforts have succeeded in reducing the interest burden by
rolling over expensive overdraft credits into lower interest RGSM instruments and at the same time
establishing a good track record of issuance and redemption on the RGSM.
37.
Progress on the resolution of ABIB and financial sector measures has been slower than
expected. The long delay illustrates the constraints the ECCB faces in implementing resolution
strategies and the need for a clearer and more expedited bank resolution framework. There have
also been significant delays in the implementation of other financial sector benchmarks. Although
the ECCB has presented an outline of a plan for the amalgamation of the indigenous banking
system in the ECCU, a number of significant details need to be fleshed out as soon as possible, so
that the plan can credibly be put into action. The authorities should also ensure that the AMC is
ready to receive and manage the assets that will be transferred from ABIB, with sufficient time to
ensure that adequate controls over information can be put in place.
38.
Progress in the implementation of structural benchmarks outside the financial sector
has also been disappointing. All structural benchmarks due to be implemented by end-June were
delayed, and are now due to be completed in October or December. Furthermore, of the seven
other benchmarks due to be completed before or by end-September, one was completed and six
will be delayed. In some areas (e.g. tax compliance in the Inland Revenue Department) tangible
progress has been made, and delays reflect a lack of capacity for implementation. In other cases, as
in customs administration and some legal reforms, the delays reflect political opposition and
deliberations within the cabinet. Staff has emphasized that adhering to the structural reform
agenda is critical to the success of the fiscal consolidation program.
39.
Staff supports the completion of the seventh review and the granting of associated
waivers. Based on the demonstrated performance and the authorities’ commitment to their
program of fiscal consolidation supported by the current Stand-By Arrangement, staff supports the
completion of the seventh review, and the authorities’ request for a waiver of nonobservance on the
continuous performance criterion on external debt arrears, and a waiver of applicability for the
end-September performance criteria.

Weak indigenous banks.

Implementation of structural reforms
has proven challenging due to
capacity constraints and political

fiscal discipline may flag as 2014
elections approach.
High
The central government has
guaranteed external debt of statutory
bodies.
Current expenditure was higher than
planned in H1 of 2012 due to
payments for SOEs’ external debt
and operational costs.
Central government is final
guarantor of deposits in the banking
system.

Geo-political uncertainties could
trigger a sharp oil price increase.
Weather shocks could lead to poor
harvests and raise the price of staple
crops.

Data from the Center for Research
on the Epidemiology of Natural
Disasters suggests a severe natural
disaster could be expected to hit one
of the ECCU countries once every
2.5 years.



High
Lower tourism receipts and lower
FDI could lead to a much lower or
negative growth outcome affecting
fiscal revenues and the debt ratio.
High
Further debt restructuring might be
necessary as flow relief expires in
2017.
Lower confidence would have a
negative effect on FDI and private
sector investment, further affecting
growth.

High
Materialization of contingent
liabilities could further damage the
public debt trajectory and investor
confidence, crowding out productive
capital investment which is already
at minimal levels.

High
A further shock to the already
weakened balance sheets of the
indigenous banks could lead to the
failure of another bank, which would
severely damage confidence in the
system, and raise fiscal costs.
Medium
Antigua is highly dependent on
imports and a simultaneous increase
in oil and food prices could put
significant pressure on the balance of
payments, external financing needs
and inflation.
High
A severe hurricane or natural disaster
could be very destructive and
disruptive for Antigua’s physical
infrastructure, economic activity and
public finances.

ANNEX 1. LETTER OF INTENT
St. Johns, Antigua
October 17, 2012
Mme. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street N.W.
Washington DC, 20431
Dear Madame Lagarde,
Our fiscal consolidation program supported by the Stand-by Arrangement (SBA) from the Fund
continues to be implemented as envisioned, despite a challenging external and domestic
environment. Fiscal consolidation is on track, debt restructuring efforts continue, and we are actively
pursuing our structural reform agenda. At the same time, the resolution of ABIB is moving forward
and plans are underway to begin to reform the legislative and regulatory environment for the
banking sector.
Within this context, Antigua and Barbuda’s performance under the SBA continues to be strong. We
have met all of the performance criteria under the program for end-June 2012, except for the
continuous performance criterion on external arrears, which was missed by a very small amount
(0.03 percent of GDP) due to a delay in loan payments of less than a month to the Caribbean
Development Bank. Accordingly, we are requesting a waiver of nonobservance for this performance
criterion based on the fact that the deviation from the performance criterion was small and
temporary. We have also made progress on meeting structural benchmarks under the program.
Although some benchmarks have been delayed, decisive action has been taken to move reforms
forward, particularly in the area of revenue administration, and we remain committed to the reform
agenda in customs, public financial management, and civil service and public enterprise reform. We
have also made progress on benchmarks in the financial sector, although there have been some
delays related to the need to wait for the conclusion of an updated valuation of ABIB’s balance sheet
to conclude the resolution of the bank.
With respect to the rest of 2012 and 2013, the government reiterates its commitment to the policies
described in our Letter of Intent (LOI) and Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP)
of May 21, 2012, and the Letter from the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) of May 9, 2012,
which encompasses continued fiscal consolidation, laying the groundwork for a gradual reduction in
the ratio of debt to GDP, as well as the resolution of ABIB and restructuring and reform of the
financial sector. We also remain committed to our structural reform agenda as described in the
previous letter of intent with revised timing in the attached table of structural benchmarks. In
42

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA

addition, we remain committed to reaching the fiscal and debt targets in the attached table on
performance criteria, which are unchanged from our previous LOI.
The attached MEFP describes recent economic developments and our performance under the
program in more detail, and updates our policies, particularly in the area of structural reforms. Fiscal,
debt and financial sector policies remain largely as described in our previous MEFP. On the basis of
past performance, these policies, and our continued commitment to our fiscal consolidation
program, we request completion of the seventh program and financing assurances reviews under
the Stand-By Arrangement, and a waiver of applicability of the end-September 2012 performance
criteria.
We are confident that the economic and financial policies set forth in the Memorandum of
Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) are adequate to ensure that the objectives of our program
are met. However, should there be any unforeseen events or external shocks, the Government of
Antigua and Barbuda stands ready to adopt the necessary policies and measures to secure the
objectives of the program. The Government of Antigua and Barbuda will consult with the IMF on the
adoption of such policies and measures, and in advance of revisions to the policies contained in the
above mentioned MEFP, in accordance with the Fund’s policies on such consultations. In addition,
the Government of Antigua and Barbuda does not intend to impose new, or to intensify existing,
trade restrictions for balance of payments purposes, or enter into bilateral payment agreements
which are inconsistent with Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. In line with our
commitment to transparency, we authorize the Fund to publish this letter of intent, the MEFP, the
Technical Memorandum of Understandings, and the accompanying staff report.
Sincerely yours,

/s/
Hon. Harold Lovell
Minister of Finance, the Economy and Public Administration

ATTACHMENT I. MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES,
2012–2013
I. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
1.
The economy is expected to recover gradually this year after the contraction in the last
three years caused by the international financial crisis:


Growth and inflation. Real economic activity seems to be recovering, driven by a small pickup
in tourist and construction activity. Headline inflation has been trending down during the year,
from 5.6 percent year-on-year in January 2012 to 3½ percent year-on-year in July.



Balance of payments. The current account deficit is expected to widen marginally in 2012 (by
about ¾ percent of GDP to 11½ percent of GDP) as domestic demand and imports recover with
economic activity.



Banking sector. Banks continue to be challenged by the steep decline in economic activity in
the last few years that continues to have a negative effect on their portfolios. The ratio of
non-performing loans has increased from 12.8 percent in December 2011 to 13.9 percent in
June 2012, but still remains below its peak of 17.7 percent in March, 2009.

II. PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PROGRAM
2.
Fiscal performance criteria for end-June under the program were met, although there
was a small and temporary breach of the performance criterion on external arrears.


Overall balance. The performance criterion on the overall deficit of the central government was
met exactly (the outcome of a deficit of EC$16 million was equal to the performance criterion).
The government met its tax revenue objectives under the program as reforms to the Inland
Revenue Department have begun to bear fruit. However, current expenditure was slightly higher
than expected due to unexpected payments for government personnel, compensation payments
that have been ordered by the Court, and transfers to the statutory bodies (external debt
payments guaranteed by the central government, and operational costs for the Port Authority).
These were offset by lower capital expenditure and lower interest payments than projected.



Primary balance. The indicative target on the primary balance was missed by a small margin
(0.3 percent of GDP) due to higher current expenditure than envisaged.



External debt and arrears. The performance criteria on external short term debt and the
contracting or guaranteeing of external debt by the non-financial public sector were met.
However, the continuous performance criterion on external arrears was breached as arrears of
EC$1 million (0.01 percent of GDP) were accumulated due to a payment that was due to the

44

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA

Caribbean Development Bank in late June that was not paid until early July. We are requesting a
waiver for this performance criterion based on the fact that the arrears were very small and paid
less than a month after the due date.


Domestic expenditure arrears. The continuous performance criterion on domestic expenditure
arrears was met.

3.
We have been implementing our structural reform agenda, although there have been
some delays.


Financial sector benchmarks. On the financial sector, the ECCB completed the on-site full
scope examinations of indigenous banks, but the presentation of strategic plan for the new bank
has been delayed until the completion of the updated valuation of ABIB, which was completed
in early October 2012. Also the amalgamation of the domestic banking system has been delayed
by slower than anticipated progress with finalizing the resolution of ABIB, which is expected in
late November 2012. Although the asset management company to dispose of the impaired
assets from the ABIB resolution has been incorporated, it is not expected to become fully
operational until the resolution of ABIB is complete. The Government will receive assistance from
an international accounting firm to flesh out the precise operational structure of the company
and develop the appropriate strategy for disposing of the impaired assets.



Internal revenue administration benchmarks. The activation of garnishment legislation for
overdue taxes has been delayed as it was folded into the new Tax Administration and
Procedures Act (TAPA), which harmonizes tax laws and is expected to be enacted by
end-November, 2012. Compliance of 15 out of 23 State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) with tax
obligations was due in June but has been delayed; however, this target is expected to have been
met by end-October, and compliance for all 23 SOEs is expected by December. We expect to
have met the benchmark for 40 percent of professionals to be compliant with their tax
obligations by end-December.



Customs administration benchmarks. Reform of customs has been delayed. The new HS 2007
customs code was due to be published in the Official Gazette in October, but the
valuation/compliance audit on petroleum imports has been postponed awaiting technical
assistance, and is now expected to be completed by end-October. The presentation and passage
of a New Customs Act is expected by end-October. The completion of a tax expenditure study
(due in September 2012) will most likely be delayed until end-October due to the need for
significant technical assistance to carry it out.



Public financial management and civil service reform. Work has commenced towards
activation of the purchase order module of FreeBalance, but technical and hardware challenges
have delayed its completion, which is now expected by end October. A strategic plan for the
Audit Department has been delayed pending technical assistance which is expected to
commence in October 2012. We expect the strategic plan will be adopted by Cabinet by
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

45

ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA

end-November 2012. With the assistance of the PFM resident advisor and technical assistance
the Treasury is on target to clear the backlog of Government financial accounts by December
2012. The draft of the new civil service bill has been completed and we are developing a Public
Sector and Social Transformation (PSST) project with the World Bank which will support our
public sector reform, social protection and active labor market policy objectives. Progress on the
functional reviews of ministries was slower than expected due to delays in concluding funding
arrangements for the technical assistance. We expect to finalize the terms of reference and
commence the process of selecting the consultants before end September 2012 and start the
functional reviews by November 2012.
4.
The process of resolution of ABIB is being carried forward. An updated valuation is
being conducted by an international accounting firm in accordance with terms of reference that
were agreed with the Fund as a prior action for the combined fourth, fifth and sixth review. The
ECCB and prospective shareholders have agreed to wait until the conclusion of the valuation before
transferring assets from ABIB to the new bank. This valuation was concluded in the early October,
2012, allowing the resolution process to be concluded by end- November. In the meantime, the
prospective shareholders of the new bank are preparing a strategic management and business plan
which will be presented at the time the new bank is licensed.

III. POLICIES FOR THE REST OF 2012 AND 2013

A. Growth and Inflation
5.
We continue to project a moderate recovery of the economy for 2012–13. For 2012 we
are projecting growth of 1 percent based on a modest pick up in tourism and some construction
activity. We are assuming inflation will ease to 3 percent by year-end given the expected softening
of fuel prices. For 2013, we are projecting growth of 1.5 percent based on improved external
conditions and a consequent improvement in tourism and FDI. Inflation is expected to remain stable
at 3 percent in 2013 given forecasts for a reduction in food and fuel prices.

B. Fiscal Policy
6.
Fiscal policy will continue to be guided by the policies laid out in our previous MEFP
(May 2012). Our fiscal consolidation program is anchored by the objective of reaching a ratio of
debt-to-GDP of 60 percent by 2020. For 2012 we have programmed an underlying primary surplus
for the central government (excluding the cost of ABIB’s resolution) of 1.7 percent of GDP and an
overall deficit of 1.3 percent of GDP. For 2013 the fiscal program is consistent with an adverse
scenario for the issuance of a recapitalization bond for ABIB of EC$340 million (10.7 percent of GDP)
with a symmetric adjustor that would change the fiscal targets if the resolution turns out to be less
costly. Under this adverse scenario, an additional effort for 2013 would target a primary surplus of
3.5 percent of GDP which we estimate is the medium-term primary surplus necessary under this
adverse scenario to bring the debt ratio to 60 percent of GDP in 2020.

46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA

7.
We reiterate our commitment to put in place the fiscal measures necessary to reach
our fiscal targets in 2013. We have identified measures that could yield a primary surplus of up to
4 percent of GDP if necessary, including:




An increase in the specific consumption tax on fuel by 20 cents per gallon (0.3 percent of GDP);
An increase in the value added tax rate of up to 2 percent (from 15 percent to 17 percent) (0.9
percent of GDP);
A reduction in transfers to the airport authority based on the collection of new passenger fees
(0.4 percent of GDP).

C. Recapitalization Bond
8.
The issuance of the recapitalization bond will continue to be guided by the following
principles:


The recapitalization bond will be issued by the Government of Antigua and Barbuda to the new
bank when it is licensed and begins operating.



The issuance of the recapitalization bond shall reflect the analysis of the valuation of the assets
presented in the updated valuation. Specifically, the bond will be equal to the difference
between the updated valuation of the assets to be transferred and the liabilities to be
transferred and will be sufficient to bring the net worth of the new bank to zero.



If in the process of establishment of the new bank the purchasers decide, in agreement with the
ECCB, to value the assets to be transferred at a higher price than suggested in the updated
valuation report, this will not affect the value of the recapitalization bond to be issued on the
balance sheet of the new bank, and the capitalization of the new bank will be based on the
valuation of assets as presented in the updated valuation report.

D. Financial Sector Policies
9.
The Eastern Caribbean Central Bank continues to be committed to take the measures
described in its letter of May 9, 2012 in a timely manner:
Resolution of ABIB


Independent valuation of the assets to be transferred to the new bank. As mentioned
above, a valuation is being undertaken and we expect it to be concluded by the end of October.



Strategic plan for the new bank. This plan is being undertaken and will be presented in the
context of the licensing of the new bank, which is expected to take place in November, 2012.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

47

ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA

Rest of the Financial System


Other indigenous banks. The ECCB has submitted a plan to restructure the indigenous banking
system in the ECCU.

10.
As part of the efforts to reduce systemic risk in the ECCU, the ECCB, under the guidance
of the monetary council, is in the process of developing plans to revise provisioning regulations and
capital adequacy in the ECCU in the medium-term. We continue to follow these developments
closely as we regard them as important measures in safeguarding the domestic banking system.

E. Structural Reforms and Social Policies
11.
Our structural reform agenda remains unchanged, but there have been delays in
implementation (Table 2). We are continuing to move the agenda forward, but have faced
challenges in our capacity to implement reforms. Some of these challenges are related to the need
for technical assistance, while others are due to technical issues beyond the control of the
government. We continue to be committed to the reform agenda and are moving forward as quickly
as possible.

F. Program Monitoring
12.
Progress in the implementation of policies under this program will be monitored
through quarterly reviews and through quantitative criteria, with indicative targets as well as
structural benchmarks. The performance criteria and indicative targets are set out in Table 1, and
structural benchmarks are presented in Table 2. Definitions for all relevant variables and reporting
requirements are contained in the attached Technical Memorandum of Understandings. The eighth,
ninth and tenth program and financing assurances reviews are expected to be completed by
December 15, 2012, March 15, 2013 and June 6, 2013 respectively.
13.
We will adhere to the safeguards policy in the case of Fund budget financing. In
accordance with the recommendations of the 2012 safeguards assessment of the ECCB, we will
maintain our foreign exchange balances only with the ECCB.

ATTACHMENT II. TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDINGS
1.
Performance under the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) will be assessed on the basis of
quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets, as well as structural benchmarks. This
Technical Memorandum of Understandings presents the definitions of variables set out in Table 1 of
the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) and the reporting requirements to
adequately monitor performance under the program.
2.
For the purposes of the program, the exchange rate of the Eastern Caribbean dollar (EC$) to
the U.S. dollar is set at EC$2.70 = US$1. Foreign currency accounts denominated in currencies other
than the U.S. dollar, excluding SDRs, will be first valued in the U.S. dollar at actual end-of-period
exchange rates used by the ECCB to calculate the official exchange rates. SDR-denominated
accounts will be valued at the program exchange rate of U.S. dollar 1.5 per SDR.

I. COVERAGE
3.
For the purpose of the program, the central government will cover all items included in the
government budget.
4.
The nonfinancial public sector is defined as the total central government and nonfinancial
public enterprises. Nonfinancial public enterprises consist of Agricultural Development Corporation,
Antigua and Barbuda Hospitality Training Institute, Antigua and Barbuda Institute of Continuing
Education, Antigua and Barbuda Investment Authority, Antigua and Barbuda Social Security Board of
Control, Antigua Barbuda Airport Authority, Antigua Barbuda Bureau of Standards Board, Antigua
Barbuda Development Bank, Antigua Barbuda Tourism Authority, Antigua Barbuda Transport Board,
Antigua Pier Group Limited, Antigua Port Authority, Antigua Public Utilities Authority, Board of
Education 1994 Limited, Central Housing and Planning Authority, Central Marketing Corporation,
Development Control Authority, Financial Services Regulatory Commission, Industrial Development
Board, Medical Benefit Scheme, Mt. St. John Medical Centre, National Parks Authority, National Solid
Waste Management Authority, PDV Caribe, St John’s Development Corporation, State Insurance
Corporation and Youth Empowerment Corporation.
5.
External debt is defined as all debt owed to creditors residing outside of Antigua and
Barbuda, while domestic debt covers all debt owed to residents of Antigua and Barbuda. All bonds
issued at the Regional Government Securities Market (RGSM) will be regarded as domestic debt.

II. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA

A. Central Government’s Overall Balance
6.
The central government’s overall balance will cover all its revenue, grants, expenditure,
and transfers. Revenues will exclude any proceeds from the sale of public assets, which will be
considered as financing.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

51

ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA

7.
The central government’s overall deficit will be measured from the financing side as the
sum of the net domestic financing plus net external financing.
8.

Net domestic financing of the central government is the sum of:



net domestic bank financing as measured by the change in the domestic banking system
credit to the central government, as reported by the consolidated balance sheet of the
monetary authorities and commercial banks, including special tranches from the ECCB and
bonds issued on the RGSM held by domestic banks;



net nonbank financing as measured by the net changes in holdings of government securities
by nonbanks, including bonds issued on the RGSM, and net borrowing from nonbank
institutions;



the change in the stock of domestic arrears of the central government defined as net
changes in unpaid checks issued, unprocessed claims, pending invoices, plus accrued
interest payments, and other forms of expenditures recorded above the line but not paid;



gross receipts from divestment are defined as proceeds received from any
privatization/divestment; and



any exceptional financing (including rescheduled principal and interest).

9.

Net external financing of the central government is defined as the sum of:



disbursements of project and non-project loans, including securitization;



proceeds from bonds issued abroad (with an original maturity of one year or greater;



exceptional financing (including rescheduled principal and interest);



net changes in central government cash deposits held outside the domestic banking system;



net changes in short-term external debt excluding exceptional financing (with an original
maturity of less than one year);



any change in arrears on external interest or principal payments and other forms of external
expenditures recorded above the line but not paid;

less:


52

payments of principal on current maturities for bonds and loans on a due basis, including
any prepayment of external debt but excluding repayments to the IMF.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA

10.
Measurement of the overall balance for purposes of the performance criterion in 2012 and
of the indicative primary surplus in 2012 will exclude the recapitalization bond issued for the
resolution of ABIB.
11.

The ceiling on the overall deficit of the central government for 2012 will be adjusted:
(i) upward to the extent that grants fall short of the programmed amounts as specified in Table 1
for 2012. Grants are defined as noncompulsory transfers, in cash or in kind, received from other
governments or from international organizations;

12.
The ceiling on the overall deficit of the central government for end-March 2013 will be
adjusted according to the size of the bond to be issued to recapitalize ABIB. Denominated in
EC$ million, the adjustor for the overall balance at end-March 2013 is determined by the following
formula:
Adjustor =
where b denotes the recapitalization bond (in EC$ million) to be issued by the Government to close
the gap between liabilities and assets to be transferred to the new bank, with the value of the assets
determined by an independent valuation.1 The adjusted target will be equal to the programmed
target plus the adjustor.
1

The formula is derived as follows. The adjustor can be expressed as:

(1)
where

is the overall balance,

is the primary balance, and is interest payments, and the superscript b denotes the

baseline projections for 2013. The revised primary balance (p) is a function of the bond issued to recapitalize ABIB (b)
according to the following linear formula:

(2)
The revised interest payments (i) are also a function of the size of the bond:

(3)
Substituting equation (2) and (3) into (1), replacing the baseline projections with nominal figures
and dividing by 4 to arrive at a quarterly adjustor yields the formula for the adjustor.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

53

ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA

13.
The ceiling on the overall deficit of the central government for end-March 2013 will be
further adjusted upward to the extent that grants fall short of the programmed amounts up to
EC$6.125 million. Grants are defined as noncompulsory transfers, in cash or in kind, received from
other governments or from international organizations.

B. Stock of Central Government Short-Term External Debt
14.
The limit on short-term external debt applies to debt owed or guaranteed by the central
government of Antigua and Barbuda (see definition in paragraph 18), with an original maturity of up
to and including one year. Excluded from the limit are any rescheduling operations (including the
deferral of interest on commercial debt) and normal import-related credits. Normal import credit is
understood to be a self-liquidating operation where the proceeds from sales of imports are used to
retire the debt. Debt falling within the limit shall be valued in U.S. dollars at the time the contract or
guarantee becomes effective.

C. External Arrears of the Central Government
15.
The non-accumulation of arrears to external creditors will be a continuous performance
criterion under the program. This performance criterion applies to debt contracted or guaranteed by
the central government from multilateral or bilateral official creditors. External payment arrears
consist of external debt service obligations (principal and interest) falling due after December 31,
2009 that have not been paid at the time due, taking into account the grace periods specified in
contractual agreements. Arrears resulting from the nonpayment of debt service for which a
clearance framework has been agreed or a rescheduling agreement is being sought are excluded
from this definition.

D. Budget Expenditure Arrears
16.
A ceiling is set on central government budget expenditure arrears to domestic private
parties, equal to the stock of such arrears as at December 31, 2011 (Table 2). This ceiling will be
monitored on a continuous basis. Budget expenditure arrears are defined as the sum of: (1) any
invoice that has been received by a spending agency from a supplier of goods, services, and capital
goods delivered and verified, and for which payment has not been made within the contractually
agreed period, or, in the absence of a grace period, within 60 days; and (2) unpaid wages, pensions,
or transfers, pending for longer than 60 days to domestic or foreign residents, irrespective of the
currency denomination of the obligation.

E. External Debt Contracted or Guaranteed by the Nonfinancial Public Sector
17.
The ceiling on external debt will be applied to contracting or guaranteeing of debt by the
nonfinancial public sector. The contracting and guaranteeing of debt will be monitored and
reported to the Fund staff by the Debt Management Unit on a monthly basis.
18.
This performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined in point No. 9 of the
―Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to External Debt in Fund Arrangements‖ adopted
by the Decision No. 14416-(09/91) of the Executive Board of the IMF, as amended effective
December 1, 2009 but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been
received:
(a) For the purpose of this guideline, the term ―debt‖ will be understood to mean a current, i.e., not
contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the
form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or more
payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some future point(s) in time; these
payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts
can take a number of forms, the primary ones being as follows:

(i) loans, i.e., advances of money to obligor by the lender made on the basis of an
undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits, bonds,
debentures, commercial loans, and buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that
are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is required to repay the
funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future
(such as repurchase agreements and official swap arrangements);
(ii) suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payments
until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered or services are provided; and
(iii) leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has the right
to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the total
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

55

ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA

expected service life of the property, while the lessor retains the title to the property. For the
purpose of the guideline, the debt is the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all
lease payments expected to be made during the period of the agreement excluding those
payments that cover the operation, repair or maintenance of the property.
(b) Under the definition of debt set out in point 10(a) above, arrears, penalties, and judicially
awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual obligation that
constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not considered debt
under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.‖
19.
Excluded from the ceiling are credits from the IMF and credits from the Caribbean
Development Bank contracted before March 4, 2011, any development policy loans contracted with
the World Bank in 2012, and loans contracted with The Export-Import Bank of China for airport
improvement and power plant repair, as described in the loan agreements of September 13, 2011,
up to 210 million Chinese yuan and 28.4 million Chinese yuan respectively2.1Also excluded are all
external loans contracted by PDV Caribe under the Petrocaribe program.
20.
The contracting of external debt for the purpose of refinancing existing obligations shall be
excluded from the ceiling, up to the amount of the existing obligation to be paid.

III. INDICATIVE TARGET ON THE PRIMARY BALANCE OF THE CENTRAL
GOVERNMENT
21.
The central government’s primary balance is defined as revenue and grants minus noninterest expenditures. As in the definition of the overall balance, revenues will exclude privatization
proceeds. Net lending is a non-interest expenditure item (negative net lending is a revenue item).
Interest expenditures include interest payments on outstanding arrears, as defined above in sections
C and D (at their contractual rates) converted to a cash basis.
22.
The floor on the primary balance of the central government will be monitored from
above the line on a cash basis. Transfers among entities of the central government are mutually
offsetting; hence, the difference between the simple sum of revenues and the simple sum of primary
expenditures across all central government entities yields the consolidated central government
primary balance. Should discrepancies arise, reconciliation between reported transfers and reported
revenues from other central government entities will be required so that compliance with the central
government primary balance target.

2

As of March 4, 2011, undisbursed balances of CDB loans already contracted with Antigua and Barbuda totaled
US$26.5 million.

56

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA

23.

The floor on the primary balance of the central government will be adjusted:



downward (i.e., a smaller primary surplus target would apply) to the extent that grants fall short
of the programmed amounts as specified in Table 1 for 2012; and



downward (i.e., a smaller primary surplus target would apply) to the extent that grants fall short
of the programmed amounts as specified in paragraph 13 of this memorandum for 2013; and



Denominated in EC$ million, the adjustor for the primary balance at end-March 2013 is
determined by the following formula:
Adjustor=
where b denotes the recapitalization bond (in EC$ million) as in the adjustor in paragraph 12.

ANNEX II. DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
1.
The current assessment of debt sustainability remains unchanged from the last
assessment in May 2012 which concluded that keeping Antigua and Barbuda’s debt on a
sustainable path is very challenging but possible under the program. Successful restructuring
with external and domestic creditors since 2009, combined with fiscal adjustment under the
program, helped bring debt on a downward path. The fiscal and financial sector measures included
in the previous program reviews will help contain Antigua and Barbuda’s risk of debt distress going
forward.
2.
The macroeconomic outlook and financial environment has remained broadly
unchanged since May 2012:


The growth forecast for 2012 and the medium term, at 1 percent and 3.5 percent respectively,
remains unchanged from the previous DSA assessment.



Inflation is now expected to rise slightly to 3.8 percent in 2012 (3.4 percent in the May 2012
assessment) and fall to around 2.3 percent over the medium term.



The current account deficit (excluding interest payments) is projected to remain at 10.6 percent
of GDP in 2012 and to gradually rise to 15.3 percent of GDP in the medium term.



The average interest rate on public debt is expected to stay at 3.3 percent in 2012 and rise only
slightly to 3.7 percent in the medium term, benefitting from the substantial debt restructuring.



The issuance of a bond for the resolution of ABIB is kept at the higher end of capitalization
estimates (EC$340 million) pending the updated valuation report of KPMG.



The domestic debt has been adjusted to exclude EC$2.75 million in December 2011 that was
double counted.

3.
As in the May 2012 assessment, Staff’s new DSA takes as a baseline the adverse
scenario that entails issuance of a recapitalization bond of EC$340 million (10.7 percent of
GDP). Under this scenario, an average primary surplus of 3.5 percent of GDP over the period from
2013 to 2020 would be required to bring the debt to GDP ratio down from a projected 97.7 percent
of GDP in 2012 to the target of 60 percent in 2020 (Table 1).
4.
Strong fiscal adjustment measures identified in the previous program reviews will put
Antigua and Barbuda’s public debt on a sustainable path, but considerable risks remain. With
the implementation of the fiscal measures identified in the previous reviews to meet the
programmed primary surplus under the adverse scenario for the resolution costs, debt would
gradually converge to a sustainable level by 2020. The bound tests show that this downward
trajectory is relatively resilient to a number of standard shocks, including higher funding costs, fiscal
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

59

ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA

slippages, real depreciation and contingent liabilities shocks, or a combination of these shocks
(Figure 1). However, public debt remains vulnerable to a growth shock, which could reverse its
downward trajectory. Beyond those risks captured in the bound tests, Antigua and Barbuda’s debt
sustainability remains vulnerable to external risks, natural disasters, and contingent liability risks
from SOEs (Box 3) and the financial sector.
5.
External debt service burden and external vulnerabilities have been significantly
reduced after successful debt restructuring with external creditors. External debt is now
projected to reach just over 20 percent of GDP in 2017, almost half the level in 2011 (Table 2).
However, Antigua’s gross external financing needs will increase substantially in the next few years,
reaching close to 20 percent of GDP in 2017 when the country starts to service the loans from the
Paris Club countries. Despite a significant decline in the external debt to GDP ratio over the medium
term, vulnerability to shocks will continue to exist. In particular, the external debt trajectory remains
highly vulnerable to a current account shock (Figure 2).
6.
In conclusion, strict adherence to the fiscal and financial sector measures under the
program will be key to maintain debt sustainability in Antigua and Barbuda. Building fiscal
buffers for the high financing needs over the medium term and the counter-cyclical policy needs will
also be important.

2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

ANNEX III. INFORMATIONAL ANNEX SUMMARY
Fund Relations
Antigua and Barbuda has outstanding obligations to the Fund of SDR 40.50 million, or 300 percent
of quota, arising from cumulative disbursements under the Standby Arrangement. The last Article IV
Consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on June 7, 2010. Missions from the Caribbean
Regional Technical Assistance Centre (CARTAC) and the Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) have visited
Antigua and Barbuda since 2006 to assist in strengthening revenue collection and public financial
management.
Antigua and Barbuda is a member of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), which manages
monetary policy and the exchange system for its eight members. The common currency, the Eastern
Caribbean dollar, has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar since
July 1976. Antigua and Barbuda has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and
maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions.
Relations with the World Bank Group
The World Bank Board discussed the Eastern Caribbean Sub-Region Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) for FY 2010–14 on June 3, 2010. The four-year CAS aims to support the sub-region’s
development agenda through two main pillars: (i) building resilience to exogenous shocks;
(ii) enhancing competitiveness and stimulating growth to help reduce poverty. There are currently
no active World Bank lending projects in Antigua and Barbuda. However, the Bank is engaged with
the authorities in the preparation of a US$7 million investment loan to: (i) strengthen public sector
human resource management; (ii) enhance the government’s capacity to develop and implement
effective social sector policies; and (iii) strengthen and broaden the coverage of vocational training
programs to increase employment and retention levels. The project is scheduled to go to the Bank’s
Board in September 2012.
Relations with the Caribbean Development Bank
The CDB supports the economic and social development of Antigua and Barbuda through policy
dialogue, the financing of priority capital projects and technical assistance. As of December 31, 2011,
the CDB had approved loans totalling US$102.5 million, with US$13.1 million undisbursed. In
December 2009, the CDB Board approved a US$30 million policy based loan to support the
government’s program of fiscal and administrative reforms. Other projects under implementation
include an airport and seaport security enhancement project, and technical assistance projects to
strengthen the operations of public Ministries.
Statistical Issues
Antigua and Barbuda participates in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). Data
provided to the Fund are broadly adequate for surveillance purposes but some weaknesses remain,
particularly in the real sector (including the consumer price index), fiscal and balance of payments
data. An April 2007 data ROSC mission assessing monetary and financial statistics noted some
improvements and identified some shortcomings in the ECCB’s monetary statistics, which were
addressed in a technical assistance mission in December 2009.

X. Exchange Rate: Antigua and Barbuda is a member of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB),
which manages monetary policy and the exchange system for its eight members. The common
currency, the Eastern Caribbean dollar, has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 per
U.S. dollar since July 1976. In practice, the ECCB has operated like a quasi-currency board,
maintaining foreign exchange backing of its currency and demand liabilities of close to 100 percent.
Antigua and Barbuda accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 in November 1983.
It maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions.
XI. Safeguards Assessment: An update safeguards assessment of the ECCB was completed in
April 2012, concluding that adequate safeguards were in place to manage resources, including IMF
disbursements.
XII. Last Article IV Consultation: Antigua and Barbuda is on the standard 12-month cycle. The last
Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on June 7, 2010. The staff report is
EBS/10/96, and its supplements are Supplement 1 (Debt Sustainability Analysis), Supplement 2
(Informational Annex), and Supplement 3 (Draft Public Information Notice).
XIII. FSAP Participation, ROSCs, and OFC Assessments: Antigua and Barbuda participated in the
regional ECCU FSAP conducted in September and October 2003. The FSSA is available at
www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2004/cr04293.pdf. A ROSC for a BCP assessment of Antigua and
Barbuda’s offshore sector is www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2004/cr04366.pdf.

ANNEX II. RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
GROUP
(As of May 16, 2012)
The World Bank Group’s Management presented to its Board the Organization of the Eastern
Caribbean States (OECS) Regional Partnership Strategy (RPS) on June 8, 2010. The RPS covers the
five year period July 2009—June 2014. It sets forth the terms of engagement of the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Development Association
(IDA) and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) with the countries of the Eastern Caribbean,
sub-regional organizations and other development partners in pursuit of the following strategic
objectives: (a) building resilience; and (b) enhancing competitiveness and stimulating growth
over the medium term.
To help build resilience, the Bank Group will support interventions aimed at promoting fiscal and
debt sustainability, protecting and improving human capital―particularly social safety nets,
education and health―and strengthening climate resilience. To help enhance competitiveness
and stimulate sustainable growth, it will focus its support on two critical areas: strengthening the
countries’ domestic financial sectors and improving access to quality services to create more
competitive business environments. The Strategy will provide urgent remedial measures to
address the crippling effects of the global and regional crises, while supporting key policy
reforms that establish a platform for growth in the medium term.
The planned program of support will entail new commitments totaling up to about
US$120 million on IBRD terms and up to US$73 million of IDA financing for the six Bank
Members of the OECS, including Antigua and Barbuda. IBRD lending to Antigua and Barbuda
may be up to US$20 million during the period of the RPS. There are currently no active
World Bank lending projects in Antigua and Barbuda.
Projects
The Bank is engaged with the authorities in the preparation of a US$7 million investment loan
aimed at: (i) strengthening the management of the public sector and making more efficient use
of its human resources; (ii) enhancing the government’s capacity to develop coherent and
efficient social sector policies and interventions on the basis of evidence; and (iii) strengthening
and increasing the coverage of intermediation services and competency-based training
programs to enhance their effectiveness in increasing the ability of adults of 18 years and older
to find and maintain a job. The project is scheduled to go to the World Bank Board in
September 2012.

ANNEX IV. STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of October 2, 2012)

I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Most
affected areas include the national accounts, fiscal, and balance of payments statistics.
Real Sector Statistics: The national accounts were rebased to a more recent year (2006) in
accordance with the methodology of the 1993 System of National Accounts in 2010. The rebasing
has led to significant improvements in the revised GDP estimates in current and constant prices,
along with broader data coverage, conceptual and methodological changes, and improved
estimation procedures. The ECCB has started a project for compiling GDP by expenditure
category for its member countries (including Antigua and Barbuda) last year.
The ECCU also rebased the national CPI to a more recent year (January 2010) and the new index
was published in December 2010. The new basket of goods and services (e.g., owner-occupied
housing, cell phones, MP3 players, and college tuition and expenses) and expanded samples of
outlets improved the CPI by reflecting current patterns in consumer purchases, making it more
representative of the entire country.
There is no comprehensive labor force survey and thus little coverage of labor market
developments. An Annual Wages and Hours Worked Survey for the private sector was conducted
in 2003, although the coverage of Barbuda was limited. The latest population census was
conducted in 2011 and preliminary results were released in February 2012.
Government finance statistics: Annual and quarterly data on central government finances
published by the ECCB are compiled broadly in line with the methodology set out in the 1986
Government Financial Statistics Manual. To better understand the underlying fiscal situation of
member countries, the ECCB has agreed that the ECCU would implement the methodology of
the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). Work is in progress in this area.
Monetary statistics: Monetary statistics are compiled by the ECCB on a monthly basis with a lag
of six weeks. In November 2009, an STA mission helped the ECCB develop report forms (returns)
to collect monetary data from non-bank financial institutions in an effort to expand the coverage
of the Other Depository Corporations Survey (ODCs) to include mortgage companies, finance
companies, building societies, credit unions, and development banks. The mission also helped
develop a financial corporations’ survey, which would include other financial corporations (OFCs)
such as offshore banks, trust companies, mutual funds, money service firms, and insurance
companies. The ECCB has developed an action plan to implement these recommendations.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA

Balance of payments: The ECCB is preparing new BOP survey forms, which will include trade in
services and provide a better coverage of foreign direct investment. In the medium-term, the
improved forms will allow for the presentation of the BOP in the Extended Balance of Payments
Services (EBOPS) and for the preparation of the International Investment Position (IIP). However,
due to delays in updating the software to reflect changes made to the survey form, the launch of
the new survey forms has been postponed.
II. Data Standards and Quality

improvement for most of the categories
(except central government debt, depository

III. Reporting to STA
Annual national account statistics are provided to the IMF for publication in the International
Financial Statistics (IFS). Antigua and Barbuda does not report government finance statistics to
the IMF for inclusion in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) and the International
Financial Statistics (IFS). In July 2006, the ECCB started reporting monetary and financial statistics
to the IMF in accordance with the methodology of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual
(MFSM 2000); the associated data have been published in the IFS since September 2006. The
ECCB reports annual balance of payments statistics for dissemination in the Balance of Payments
Statistics Yearbook (BOPSY). However, Antigua and Barbuda does not report trade data for
publication in the Direction of Trade Statistics Yearbook (DOTS).

IMF Executive Board Completes Seventh Review Under Stand-by Arrangement for
Antigua and Barbuda and Approves US$5.2 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the seventh
review of Antigua and Barbuda’s economic performance under a program supported by a
36-month Stand-by Arrangement (SBA). The completion of the review allows the immediate
disbursement of an amount equivalent to SDR 3.375 million (about US$5.2 million),
bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to an amount equivalent to
SDR 43.875 million (about US$67.6 million).
In completing the review, the Executive Board approved the authorities' request for a waiver
of nonobservance of the performance criterion on the central government external payments
arrears. The waiver was granted on the grounds of temporary and minor deviations from the
program objectives and the corrective measures undertaken by the authorities. The Executive
Board also approved a request for a waiver of applicability for the end-September 2012
performance criteria (PC). This waiver was necessary because the Executive Board meeting
was scheduled to take place after end-September but prior to the availability of data to assess
the relevant end-September PCs. In addition, data revisions indicate that the reported basis
for the Executive Board granting a waiver of the end-September 2011 performance criterion
on the central government overall deficit was off by a small amount, which was deemed to be
irrelevant from a macroeconomic perspective, and the Executive Board approved the relevant
waiver of the related condition.
The SBA was approved on June 7, 2010 (see Press Release No. 10/232), for an original
amount of total access equivalent to SDR 81 million (about US$128 million), which was
later adjusted pursuant to the authorities’ request and consistent with Antigua and Barbuda’s
lower balance of payments need (see Press Release No. 12/202).
Following the Executive Board’s discussion, Mr. Min Zhu, Deputy Managing Director and
Acting Chair, made the following statement:

2

“The economy of Antigua and Barbuda is expected to recover gradually in 2012 after a
significant contraction in the last three years, reflecting the global financial crisis.
Nevertheless, weaker domestic activity and an uncertain global environment continue to pose
a risk for growth prospects, which remain well below their pre-crisis levels.
“In the face of these challenges, the authorities’ have continued to make progress on the
fiscal consolidation program through control of expenditures and improvements in revenue
administration. All of the performance criteria under the program for end-June 2012 were
met, except for a minor and temporary breach of the continuous performance criterion on
external arrears. The authorities have continued their successful efforts in debt restructuring
to reduce the burden of debt service and lower the level of public debt, although contingent
liabilities in state-owned enterprises and the banking sector are presenting challenges.
“The process for resolution of Antigua and Barbuda Investment Bank is at an advanced stage
and the authorities are making efforts to conclude the resolution as soon as possible.
Measures on banking supervision, bank restructuring and updating the regulatory and legal
framework are being planned to maintain the stability of the financial system going forward.
“Continued successful implementation of the program in the fiscal area is key to a steady
reduction of the public debt burden and to fiscal sustainability. This calls for sustained fiscal
discipline and resolute implementation of structural reforms in revenue administration and
public financial management. Fiscal reforms will also enhance the quality of adjustment and
provide the space needed to accelerate job- and growth-enhancing expenditures, particularly
public infrastructure investment.”

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Antigua and Barbuda
On October 31, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Antigua and Barbuda. 1
Background
Antigua and Barbuda is recovering gradually from a deep recession. A sharp contraction
in tourism activity and foreign direct investment led to an economic contraction of over
20 percent in the last three years. For 2012, real GDP is expected to grow by 1 percent,
based on a modest recovery in tourism, and construction activity related to government
initiatives. Weak domestic demand has kept core inflation subdued, and a spike in
headline inflation early in 2012, related to the lagged pass-through of high international
fuel prices in 2011, has been reversed. Headline inflation is expected to end the year at
around the long-term average of 3 percent. The external current account deficit shrank
substantially during the crisis along with the contraction in domestic demand and tighter
external financing, but with the recovery is expected to widen marginally, from
10¾ percent of GDP in 2011 to 11 ½ percent of GDP in 2012. Downside risks to the
near-term outlook have intensified with heightened global uncertainty, and the
materialization of fiscal contingent liabilities could further challenge the government’s
fiscal consolidation program.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2

The banking system felt the effects of the economic contraction. Credit to the private
sector has contracted, and the share of non-performing loans has risen. Profitability has
weakened with declining credit quality and tighter liquidity at indigenous banks.
Nevertheless, the overall banking system remains relatively well capitalized and liquid,
providing adequate buffers. In July 2011 the ECCB intervened the Antigua and Barbuda
Investment Bank (ABIB) and has held the bank in conservatorship pending resolution.
However, progress on the resolution of ABIB and other financial sector measures has
been slower than expected.
Fiscal consolidation has progressed despite a very difficult environment. Government
revenues have fallen with the decline in economic activity, although they are expected to
recover slightly in 2012 due to the authorities’ reforms in the Inland Revenue
Department. In the face of the contraction in revenue, the authorities adjusted
expenditure to reach their fiscal targets by maintaining primary current spending
constant and sharply contracting capital spending. Significant fiscal savings also came
from lower interest payments, as the authorities successfully pursued debt restructuring
on the external front (mainly from the Paris Club) and from domestic creditors. Fiscal
consolidation and debt relief led to a decline in the ratio of debt to GDP from over 100
percent in 2009 to around 90 percent in 2011, despite the large contraction in GDP.
However, for 2012 the debt ratio is expected to rise again due to the impact of the
resolution of ABIB by the government.
The authorities requested IMF financial assistance in support of their fiscal consolidation
and economic reform program. The main objective of the authorities’ program is to put
the public debt firmly on a downward trajectory through fiscal consolidation, debt
restructuring and comprehensive reforms in revenue administration and public financial
management. The program also focuses on reforms in financial sector supervision and
regulation to ensure financial stability. The reform program was designed to catalyze
financing from other international and regional financial institutions and created the
framework for a successful debt renegotiation. The program is supported by a 36-month
Stand-By Arrangement from the IMF which was approved by the Executive Board on
June 7, 2010 (see Press Release 10/232 of June 8, 2010).

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed signs of recovery in Antigua and Barbuda’s economy
after three years of contraction, and commended the authorities’ strong commitment to
their economic program. Noting the significant challenges still posed by the difficult
global and domestic environment, Directors called for continued steadfast
implementation of the program. Accelerating structural reforms, especially fiscal and
financial sector reforms, will be essential to restore growth and ensure macroeconomic
and financial stability.
Directors supported the authorities’ commitment to fiscal consolidation and efforts to
reduce public debt, with some cautioning that consolidation should not come at the
expense of the fragile economic recovery. To ensure fiscal sustainability and create a
buffer against shocks, Directors stressed the importance of improved public financial

3
management and expenditure rationalization, without constraining the much-needed
capital spending. They stressed that reversing delays in the structural reform agenda,
including broadening the tax base, especially by eliminating tax exemptions, would help
enhance revenue. Directors also considered reform of the pension system and improved
oversight of state-owned enterprises to be important priorities going forward.
Directors underscored the importance of continued efforts to improve financial sector
stability. They called for timely resolution of Antigua and Barbuda Investment Bank and
other financial sector measures, including operation of the asset management company.
Directors stressed the need for stronger supervision of banks and non-bank financial
institutions, including through consolidated supervision of financial conglomerates. They
urged the authorities to move forward in tightening regulations on asset classification
and loan loss provisioning, and introducing risk-based supervision, with more frequent
onsite examinations of banks. Directors also stressed the importance of regional
cooperation on developing a well-defined bank resolution framework. They encouraged
the authorities to continue to improve the AML/CFT supervisory framework.
Directors emphasized that restoring growth must be a priority. Reforms to improve
competitiveness, which has been eroded in recent years, and diversify the economy
should focus on enhancing productivity, reforming the labor market, and improving the
business climate.
