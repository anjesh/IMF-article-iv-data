I. INTRODUCTION AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.
The U.S. expansion solidified during the past year despite higher world oil prices.
Robust productivity growth and high corporate profits have contributed to a strong rebound
in business investment and some acceleration in employment. Growth is again projected to
outstrip that of other G-7 countries by a wide margin in 2005, although the recent softness in
indicators has caused some scaling back of growth projections.
2.
The policy focus has appropriately shifted toward the removal of stimulus. Having
cut the federal funds rate aggressively over the downturn, the Federal Reserve reversed
course in mid-2004 as deflation risks receded, and has since raised the rate by a cumulative
2¼ percentage points. The Administration has reaffirmed its commitment to reducing the
budget deficit to below 2 percent of GDP by FY 2009 through rigorous spending restraint,
and to making earlier tax cuts permanent.
3.
Against the backdrop of widening global current account imbalances and low
national saving, discussions centered on the importance of safeguarding the near-term
economic outlook and preparing for demographic challenges:
•

Removing macroeconomic stimulus. With margins of economic slack falling, the
mission noted that the pace of interest rate hikes may need to accelerate if inflationary
pressures were to mount. At the same time, the team stressed that the burden on
monetary policy and the current account would be eased considerably with the
adoption of a more ambitious fiscal objective.

•

Preparing for an aging population. The team reemphasized that the government debt
ratio should be placed on a clear downward path to prepare for the spending pressures
from population aging, and that delaying needed reforms of Social Security and the
health care system would make subsequent adjustments more painful.

•

Maintaining high-productivity growth. The mission discussed tax and other options
for enhancing saving incentives and improving investment efficiency, while
cautioning that the trade imbalance is beginning to foster protectionism and could
undermine U.S. leadership in bringing the Doha Round to a successful conclusion.

-4-

Box 1. Impact of Past Fund Advice
U.S. officials generally emphasized that there is a broad consensus with the Fund on the
fundamental factors underlying growth in the United States. Chief among these are strong
property rights, sound institutions—including world class financial regulators—the flexibility
of U.S. factor markets, low taxation, the relatively small size of government, and a high degree
of transparency of economic policy decisions.
The Fund has been broadly supportive of the Federal Reserve’s conduct of monetary policy
in recent years. In July 2004, the Board commended the Fed for its earlier forceful response to
signs of deflationary pressures and endorsed the shift in the policy stance in mid-2004 toward a
gradual removal of stimulus.1 The staff has long recommended an explicit statement of the
Federal Reserve’s long-term inflation objective, but the authorities have argued that the
potential benefits would be modest.
More significant differences of view have emerged on the size and speed of fiscal
consolidation and global current account imbalances:
•

The Fund and the authorities share the view that the fiscal deficit is too large and needs to
be reduced. The Administration has adopted a target of reducing the federal deficit to
slightly below its long-term average of around 2 percent of GDP by FY 2009. The staff
has called for a more ambitious consolidation effort, aimed at balancing the federal budget
excluding Social Security over a period of 5-10 years.

•

The Fund has also cautioned that revenue measures could be used to support deficit
reduction—especially those broadening the tax base and shifting the burden from income
to consumption—while the authorities have argued strongly that higher taxes would have
damaging efficiency consequences and fuel wasteful government spending.

•

Although the authorities and the Fund agreed on the need to boost U.S. national saving,
the authorities have disagreed that the large U.S. current account deficit—which they see
as largely reflecting weak demand growth in key partners—poses a significant risk of
“disorderly adjustment” or that it argues for more aggressive fiscal adjustment.

The Fund has long urged the authorities to address the underfunding of the Social Security
and Medicare systems. Although 2003 legislation significantly worsened the financial position
of the Medicare system, the Administration has taken encouraging steps to place the Social
Security system on a sound financial footing.

The U.S. economy has continued
to lead the global recovery over the last
year (see Figure on next page). The
expansion was initially slowed by the
effects of the bursting of the IT bubble
and geopolitical developments following
the 2001 terrorist attacks. More recently,
household spending has remained robust
and business investment has rebounded,
supported by low interest rates. Despite
having eased somewhat as the expansion
has matured, productivity growth has
remained well above longer-term trends
and supported record-high corporate
profits.

The U.S. expansion and low interest rates have provided a substantial boost to the
rest of the world at a time of significant global slack. U.S. net imports have increased
growth in the rest of the world by about ¼ percentage point a year since 2001. U.S. financial
conditions have also helped compress risk premiums, lowering interest spreads and
supporting activity across a wide range of emerging markets.
7.
High oil prices appear to have contributed to a recent softening in U.S. activity.

first quarter of 2005. A spate of weaker indicators on activity and spending in March
suggested that some softening of growth might persist into the second quarter, although
recent reports indicate that domestic demand remains solid.
8.
As economic slack has narrowed, the inflation environment has become less
benign. Although the core deflator for personal consumption expenditure—the Fed’s
preferred inflation measure—has risen only modestly and currently stands at just above
1½ percent (12-month rate), higher energy prices have pushed headline CPI inflation to
3½ percent in recent months, accompanied by a moderate uptick in inflation expectations.
The labor market has exhibited few signs of overheating—employment growth has been
moderate by historical standards and the drop in the unemployment rate to 5.1 percent
appears to have largely reflected lower participation. However, weaker productivity growth
since mid-2004 has contributed to an acceleration in unit labor costs.
9.
The current account deficit has steadily widened as U.S. growth has continued to
outpace that of most trading partners. Despite the depreciation of the U.S. dollar by about
15 percent in real effective terms over the past three years, the current account deficit
increased to 6½ percent of GDP in the first quarter of 2005. This has been mainly driven by
sustained strong growth in real imports of consumption and capital goods and higher oil

Financial flows have departed from long-term trends and appear unsustainable,
with foreign savings and corporate profits increasingly financing government and household
spending.
•

Foreign savings are being provided at record levels. The counterpart of the record
current account deficit has been massive capital inflows, and U.S. net international
liabilities are estimated to have risen to about 25 percent of GDP.

•

Net lending by the corporate sector is also at record highs. Notwithstanding
difficulties with auto and airline sectors, businesses have used high profits to
strengthen balance sheets that—along with foreign inflows—has contributed to low
long-term interest rates.1

•

Tax cuts and expenditure increases have turned the public sector into a significant
borrower. The federal government budget shifted from a 2½ percent of GDP surplus
in FY 2000 to a 3½ percent of GDP deficit in FY 2004, leaving the general
government deficit at 4¼ percent of GDP in calendar year 2004.

•

The household saving rate has fallen to record lows. Even accounting for the boost
from strong asset markets, the staff estimates that the saving rate is currently some
1½-2 percentage points below a level consistent with household income and wealth.2
Chapter 2 of the Selected Issues discusses how technological change and trade
openness may be tending to reduce the share of national income going to labor.
B. Short-Term Outlook and Risks

11.
Barring shocks, the staff projects growth of 3½ percent in 2005 and 2006, slightly
above potential and close to the consensus forecast. Reflecting some rebalancing of growth
and normalizing domestic financial flows, both the personal and national saving rate would
gradually rise while stronger investment would reduce corporate net lending. Although the
trade balance would benefit somewhat from lagged exchange rate effects, the current account
deficit would remain at over 6 percent of GDP (assuming an unchanged real effective
exchange rate) as increasing foreign debt and higher interest rates would weigh on the
income balance. This scenario assumes that:
•

Short-term interest rates gradually increase through 2006 and the fiscal balance
improves modestly.

The low level of long-term interest rates are discussed in Box 1.2 in the April 2005 World Economic Outlook.

Based on an update of analysis presented in Chapter 1 of United States—Selected Issues (IMF Country
Report 03/245).

-9-

•

Real long-term interest rates and spreads return to more typical values as business
investment and national saving rebound, while residential investment growth eases.

•

Productivity growth decelerates further as the economy returns to full employment
before settling at 2¼ percent, supporting potential growth of 3¼ percent.3

•

Inflation remains contained as slack is eroded only gradually and robust labor
productivity growth limits unit labor cost increases.

Officials were in broad agreement with the staff’s outlook, and saw short-term risks
as largely balanced. Federal Reserve officials noted, in particular, that the pace of growth in
the latter half of 2004 had prompted fears that inflation pressures were building, and that
some slowing was an appropriate response to the withdrawal of monetary stimulus. Prospects
for business investment remained favorable, given healthy corporate balance sheets, signs
that capital stocks remained below trend in some sectors, and still easy financial conditions.
Notwithstanding recent softness in business and consumer sentiment, steady employment and
income growth, together with buoyant household net wealth, would support solid increases in
consumption.

that substantial uncertainty
surrounded estimates of its potential
growth. The large financial imbalances facing the United States left it vulnerable to a
sustained slowdown in productivity, which could increase cost pressures, shift investor
preferences away from U.S. assets, and push up global interest rates and risk premia.4

Officials acknowledged the risk that sustained high oil prices could weigh on
activity. Federal Reserve officials suggested that recent oil price developments are
dampening household spending and confidence, and lowering growth by ½-¾ percentage
points during 2005. Although this shock was unlikely to derail the expansion, past experience
suggested that the macroeconomic response could be stronger than model predictions,
especially if higher energy prices were viewed as more than temporary.
15.
Officials also noted signs of “froth” in the housing sector. House prices in some
regions had moved above levels consistent with personal incomes and rents, and there were
signs of increased speculative activity, including more widespread purchases of second
homes and use of interest-only loans. However, the situation at the national level was less of
a concern, and the most likely scenario was a flattening of prices rather than outright
declines. This would affect consumer spending, particularly given recent support through
home equity withdrawals. Staff agreed that house price stagnation was the most likely
scenario and that, while standard multipliers would imply a reduction in consumption growth
of less than 1 percent a year from such an outcome, the impact could be larger given the
already extremely low household saving rate.
Risks from Global Imbalances

Officials agreed that the U.S. current account was likely to widen further in 2005 in
the absence of a significant pick-up in partner country growth (see Figure on next page).

had been broadly consistent with their economic model, and that several factors limited
prospects for a significant narrowing in the near-term:
•

Trade elasticities. The income elasticity of U.S. demand for imports is typically
estimated to be significantly larger than that of foreign demand for U.S. goods.

•

Openness. Exports represent only 10 percent of GDP and, with imports half again as
large, exports volumes have to grow significantly faster than imports simply to keep
the deficit unchanged.

•

Pass-through and trade shares. Recent analyses at the Fed and the Fund suggest that
the pass-through may have fallen over time, possibly reflecting changing trade
patterns, reducing the impact of exchange rate depreciation on the trade balance (see
Box 2 as well as Chapter 3 of the Selected Issues paper, which examine reasons for
the rapid fall in the trade balance in recent years).

•

Debt dynamics. Larger international liabilities, particularly in debt securities, are
expected to weaken the income balance of the current account, especially as U.S.
interest rates rise. This would increase the correction in the trade balance needed to
stabilize the U.S. net international investment position.5

17.
Officials tended to downplay the Fund’s well-publicized concerns about a
“disorderly adjustment.” The United States’ economic strength and large, liquid financial
markets—as well as the absence of more attractive destinations for global capital—meant a
sharp reversal of investor sentiment was unlikely. They noted the recent strengthening of the
dollar, brisk foreign demand for U.S. corporate bonds, as well as recent analysis suggesting
global investment portfolios were generally not overweight in U.S. assets. (Chapter 4 of the
Selected Issues paper arrives at a similar finding but also suggests that the United States’
negative international investment position is large once the size of its economy is taken into
account). Fed officials agreed that a significant depreciation of the dollar would be needed to
narrow the trade balance and stabilize the net investment position (Box 2 discusses the
dollar’s overvaluation), although the dollar denomination of U.S. foreign liabilities meant
that revaluation of wealth would work in favor of U.S. residents.
18.
The authorities also observed that there was little more that U.S. policies could do
to address global imbalances. They had acknowledged the need to raise U.S. national saving
and, under the G-7 Agenda for Growth, had agreed to halve the nominal federal budget

Box 2. Why Has the U.S. Trade Balance Deteriorated So Fast?1
The U.S. trade deficit has widened rapidly
in recent years, notwithstanding the dollar’s
15 percent real effective depreciation since
early 2002. Similar to many other
forecasters, the staff’s trade model would
have projected significantly stronger exports
and weaker imports over that period, even
accounting for robust U.S. growth and higher
oil prices. This Box discusses two factors that
may have muted the impact of the dollar’s
fall on the external accounts.

entry of low-cost producing countries. For
example, if U.S. dollar prices of imports respond less to exchange rate movements, then the adjustment
of trade volumes to depreciation will be smaller. In this case, staff estimates would suggest some
diminution in the short-term impact of the real exchange rate on import prices of manufactures, although
whether this reflects slower dynamics or smaller long-term pass through remains unclear (see Chapter 3
of the Selected Issues paper). Geographic data on trade prices suggest a regional pattern—unlike for
Asian countries, the prices of imports from Canada and Europe responded similarly to exchange rate
changes as in the past.
Rapidly changing trade patterns could also be leading to an overestimation of the gain in U.S.
external competitiveness. China’s weight in U.S.

Staff analysis suggests that the U.S. dollar remains significantly overvalued. U.S. exports have lost
some market share in recent years, and the current account deficit appears at least 3 percent of GDP
higher than suggested by medium-term fundamentals. The Fed’s broad CPI-based real effective
exchange rate is also above its estimated value using a modified purchasing parity approach. The large
correction against major industrial countries since 2002, most notably the euro, has been blunted by
almost no movement against the currencies of emerging markets as a group, which account for almost
half the weights in the Fed’s U.S. exchange rate index.

deficit by FY 2009. However, the current account balance was not an appropriate target for
U.S. policies, and empirical evidence to support the “twin deficits” hypothesis was weak.6
Staff were more confident about the link between deficit reduction, saving, and the external
balance (simulations in Appendix IV as well as Chapter 5 of the Selected Issues paper
suggest that a permanent change in the fiscal balance generates a significant current account
improvement) but agreed that an international strategy—as outlined in the latest IMFC
communiqué—was needed to help move the U.S. external deficit to sustainable levels.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS: SUSTAINING THE RECOVERY
A. Withdrawing Monetary Stimulus
19.
In mid-2004, the Federal Reserve began to gradually withdraw monetary
accommodation. After having kept overnight rates at 1 percent for over a year to head off
deflationary pressures, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has raised the federal
funds rate by 25 basis points at each of its meetings since June 2004, to 3¼ percent. Although
the FOMC noted in its June 30 statement that pressures on inflation stayed elevated and
monetary conditions remained accommodative, it also observed that long-term inflation
expectations were well contained and “policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that
is likely to be measured.”
20.
The mission raised for discussion whether the pace of monetary tightening needed
to be accelerated to forestall a further pickup in inflation. Although the careful withdrawal
of accommodation had been effective in supporting the expansion and avoiding disruption to
bond markets, real short-term interest rates were still around zero. Extremely low long-term
rates also suggested that market participants could be unduly discounting future rate hikes,
especially given the potential for higher energy prices and rising unit labor costs to feed cost
pressures.
21.
Fed officials replied that the current policy stance appropriately balanced the goals
of price stability and growth. In line with a “risk management” approach to monetary policy,
the FOMC had explicitly shifted its attention to inflation over the past year.7 Against this
background, officials saw signs that the withdrawal of monetary stimulus had helped
moderate the pace of economic growth to a more sustainable level, suggesting that policy
was not overly stimulative. At the same time, they viewed underlying price pressures as
relatively benign given the low rate of core PCE inflation, stable inflation expectations, and
signs that underlying unit labor cost increases were well contained.

6

The Federal Reserve has estimated that a deficit reduction of 1 percent of GDP would lead to only a
0.2 percentage point increase in the current account balance.

22.
Against a background of unusually low global bond yields, the Fed’s policy stance
would necessarily become more data-dependent as interest rates returned to neutral levels.
Officials agreed that short-term interest rates remained well below most estimates of an
“equilibrium” neutral rate but noted that this rate was not invariant to economic
circumstances. They doubted that the flatness of the yield curve reflected headwinds facing
the economy, such as high oil prices and a low household saving rate. More likely
explanations for the low level of long-term interest rates internationally included greater
confidence that inflation pressures were contained and the strength of global saving relative
to investment, which was still suffering from the collapse of the IT bubble.
23.
Staff commended the FOMC’s skillful communication policy in recent years. Fed
officials explained that this reflected lessons learned from the 1994 period, when market
participants began to feel that policymakers had fallen behind the curve. Then, the Fed was
forced to hike the federal funds rate by 125 basis points in two quick steps, which had
prompted bond yields to overshoot significantly. In the present cycle, the FOMC had sought
to avoid a repetition of this earlier experience by communicating clearly its commitment to
price stability early in the tightening cycle while emphasizing that a gradual withdrawal of
stimulus was the more likely course.
24.
The mission repeated its long-standing suggestion that a more explicit long-term
inflation objective could further anchor expectations and long-term bond yields (see Box 3,

Box 3. Would An Explicit Definition of Price Stability Reduce Bond Price Volatility?1
This Box compares the volatility of U.S. bond yields and inflation expectations with those of Canada and the

the suggestion put forward by proponents of a more explicit objective for inflation that such a target could help
stabilize medium-term inflation expectations and improve financial intermediation.
Since 1990, daily volatility of changes in
benchmark bond yields has trended down in
Canada and the United Kingdom, and is now
below that of the United States. A similar pattern
exists when volatility is calculated on a weekly and

as well as Chapter 6 of the Selected Issues paper). Officials noted that the FOMC had
debated this issue recently, but had not reached a consensus. Officials also cautioned that the
Federal Reserve was subject to a dual mandate—price stability and maximum employment—
and that quantifying the inflation objective could trigger efforts to define full employment
and unduly constrain the Committee’s room for maneuver. In any event, officials stressed
that the Fed was already one of the most open central banks in the world, and the FOMC was
committed to continued improvements in other areas of transparency.
25.
Officials stressed the headway Administration had made toward its objective of
bringing the federal fiscal deficit below 2 percent of GDP by FY 2009. Government
revenues had rebounded strongly over the past year, owing to high corporate profits and
steady income growth. Partly as a result, the FY 2004 deficit came in at 3½ percent of
GDP—1 percentage point better than expected—and the outcome for FY 2005 could be
under 3 percent of GDP. Moreover, prospects for containing the FY 2006 deficit had been
boosted by Congress’ budget resolution, which was broadly consistent with the
Administration’s expenditure reduction plans
B. The Pace of Fiscal Consolidation
26.
The mission welcomed the progress made toward fiscal consolidation, but stressed
that this seemed to reflect principally cyclical rather than structural gains. The structural
primary balance—which excludes both cyclical revenue fluctuations and the effects of low
interest rates on the cost of servicing government debt—remained close to historic lows, with
the budget implying only a modest 1½ percent of GDP improvement over the next five years.
The mission also noted that medium-term budget projections assume unprecedented
compression of nondefense discretionary spending, which would be difficult to sustain (see
chart on next page). In addition, budget projections took no account of funding for operations
in Iraq and Afghanistan after FY 2006 or of pressures to limit the growing scope of the
Alternative Minimum Tax.

deficit by roughly 1 percent of GDP per annum over the next few years would reduce
the burden on monetary policy to address domestic financial imbalances without
placing an undue drag on activity in the short term, as illustrated by an alternative
scenario (Appendix IV).
•

Low national saving and large external deficit. The staff’s simulation suggests that a
4 percent of GDP permanent increase in the fiscal balance raises national saving by
some 3 percent of GDP over the next 5 years, while reducing the external deficit by
almost 2 percent of GDP (Appendix IV). This would move the current account closer
to a sustainable level while significantly improving investment and growth at home
and abroad.

•

Global policy coordination. By taking decisive steps toward fiscal consolidation, the
United States would demonstrate leadership in implementing the G-7 Agenda for
Growth, and possibly catalyze other countries to take bolder action, further reducing
global current account imbalances and associated vulnerabilities.

•

Supporting long-term fiscal sustainability (see Figure on next page). Most
importantly, consolidation formed an essential element in moving toward long-term
fiscal sustainability.8 Putting the government debt ratio on a clear downward path
would improve intergenerational fairness by reducing the burden on future
generations to pay for the increases in expenditures associated with population aging.
Deficit reduction would also allow time to develop and phase in gradually measures
needed to reform health and retirement programs.

28.
Officials agreed that raising national saving was an important policy priority, but
saw no need to strengthen their fiscal objective. The Administration had made substantial
progress in putting in place a framework for identifying expenditure priorities and improving
spending efficiency that would yield savings in the coming years.9 Officials emphasized that
revenue enhancements could spur higher spending, and the key to fiscal sustainability was
the reform of entitlement programs, rather than achieving a more ambitious near-term deficit
target. In their view, a fiscal deficit below 2 percent of GDP—which they were confident of
reaching—was appropriate since it was well within the range of historical budget deficits and
fiscal positions in other industrial countries.
29.
Nevertheless, the mission suggested that fiscal sustainability would likely require
revenue measures. The President’s Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform has been charged
with reporting on ways to simplify and improve the efficiency of the tax system in a revenueneutral manner, which officials explained meant a baseline that included AMT revenues. The

mission strongly supported this undertaking, but argued that the magnitude of the fiscal
adjustment that was needed and already ambitious plans for spending discipline suggested
that options for revenue enhancements should be actively considered. Officials responded
that some additional revenues could be expected from higher growth due to greater economic
efficiency.
30.
There was broad agreement that a legislated fiscal rule could support consolidation
efforts. Notwithstanding last year’s defeat of a similar bill, the Administration has sought to
re-authorize discretionary spending caps and pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) provisions that
require the costs of proposals increasing the deficit to be offset elsewhere in the budget.
Unlike the mission, however, the Administration preferred that PAYGO provisions apply
only to expenditure since they viewed revenue offsets as a potential encouragement to taxfinanced spending increases.
C. Long-Term Fiscal Sustainability and Entitlement Reform
31.
The authorities agreed that long-term unfunded obligations, particularly for health
care, posed the largest challenge to U.S. long-term fiscal sustainability. Although much of
the recent debate has been on Social Security, federal health care spending has been rising at
a much faster pace. This trend is projected to continue, mainly reflecting cost pressures
associated with shifts in demand, technological improvements and, to a smaller extent, the
effects of population aging. As a result, the actuarial liability of the Social Security system
over the next 75 years—estimated at 30 percent of GDP—is dwarfed by the estimated
200 percent of GDP unfunded liability of the Medicare system, a third of which arose from
the prescription drug benefit enacted in 2003.10
There is scope for increasing efficiency in health care
spending.

32.
With public spending financing half of
all U.S. health care outlays, the mission
questioned whether Medicare and Medicaid
spending could be contained without reforms
in the overall health sector (Box 4). The
United States spends almost twice as much on
health care as a ratio to GDP than other OECD
countries—a gap only partly explained by
income elasticities and consumer preferences.

Pension projections are subject to some demographic risks, but are relatively invariant to changes in
economic variables such as underlying productivity growth. Accordingly, the main uncertainties relate to health
spending, where Medicare estimates are subject to upside risks. Actuarial calculations assume per-beneficiary
spending grows at 1 percentage point a year above the growth rate of per-capita GDP, while the excess over the
last decade has been more like 2–2½ percent, a value that would approximately double the unfunded liability
over 75 years. In addition, both federal and state governments face future budgetary pressures from Medicaid.

Box 4. Medicare and Medicaid1
This box describes the financing of the two main publicly financed entitlement health care
programs—Medicare and Medicaid. These programs currently foot over one-third of all U.S. health
spending, and are projected to growth rapidly in coming years as health costs rise and the population
ages.
Medicare is a federal government program that provides health care for the elderly and disabled.
Outlays of some 2½ percent of GDP comprise:
•

Hospital insurance (HI). Funded by a 2.9 percent payroll tax, it is currently running a small surplus
(¼ percent of GDP), with assets held in a trust fund. However, HI deficits are projected from 2018,
and the trust fund will be exhausted by 2030.

•

Supplemental Medical Insurance (SMI). About one-quarter of costs are funded by premiums, with
the balance coming from general
government revenues.
United States: Health spending

•

Prescription drug coverage. Legislated in
2003, benefits will become available on
January 1, 2006. Only about 25 percent of
program costs will be covered by premiums
and the cost of standard basic coverage is
estimated at $593 billion over the 20042013 period by the Congressional Budget
Office (CBO).

FY 2006 Budget contains proposals that would further shift fiscal responsibility for Medicaid to the
states, reducing federal financing by about $45 billion over ten years. The existing cost-sharing
arrangement would be replaced by block grants to states that would be indexed to CPI inflation, rather
than increases in the states’ outlays. Certain financing vehicles used by the states to increase federal
share of funds would be streamlined, and payments to state and local hospitals and nursing homes would
be capped. In addition, states would be given more flexibility to reduce the cost of prescription drugs and
prevent abuse of the Medicare’s long-term care coverage by non-needy individuals through a transfer of
funds to their families.

outcomes also seem to stem from inefficiencies and weak incentive structures in the private
health insurance system, as well as the large uninsured population (see Chapter 7 of the
Selected Issues paper).
33.
Officials emphasized that steps had already been taken to strengthen the health
care system. They noted that legal challenges to the operations of health maintenance
organizations had undermined the ability of private insurers to rationalize and economize on
medical benefits. Accordingly, the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) had
introduced tax-preferred Health Savings Accounts aimed at increasing the cost-sensitivity of
consumers by encouraging high deductible insurance plans. The MMA also required pilot
projects starting in 2010 to test whether competition between private and traditional fee-forservice plans could improve health care delivery and reduce costs. Moreover, the
Administration was promoting tax preferences for purchases of health insurance by lowincome workers, as well as tort reform to curb defensive medicine. Several years would be
needed to gauge the success of these initiatives, during which the difficult political hurdles of
Social Security and tax reform could be addressed. Thereafter, a broader national debate on
health care reform could well be needed.
34.
The mission welcomed the impetus the President had recently provided to the
debate on fully funding Social Security (Box 5). Officials explained that, by linking future
increases in initial benefits to a sliding combination of wage and price indexes, “progressive
indexing”—which the President had endorsed—would eliminate some 70 percent of the
system’s unfunded liabilities while preserving replacement ratios for low-income workers. If
needed, this approach would enable further adjustment of indexation formulas in the future
and, if coupled with other reforms—such as increasing the statutory retirement age—would
close the system’s 75-year actuarial gap and yield a positive cash flow at the end of the 75year period. The Administration viewed the latter objective as a critical criterion for judging
sustainability.
35.
The team cautioned that it would be important to couple the introduction of
personal retirement accounts (PRAs) with measures to ensure the long-term solvency of
the Social Security system. PRAs would permit younger workers to shift up to 4 percentage
points of social security contributions into PRAs, coupled with an equivalent reduction (in
net present value terms) in future Social Security benefits. As discussed in Chapter 8 of the
Selected Issues paper, the proposal would cause a significant increase in federal deficits and
debt over several decades as implicit liabilities are recognized and transitional costs borne,
even though its direct impact on national saving and financial markets would likely be
marginal. This underscores the importance of ensuring that PRAs not be introduced without
measures to eliminate the system’s unfunded liabilities.

- 24 -

Box 5. U.S. Social Security Proposals in an International Context1
Social Security reform eliminating the system’s funding gap and involving Personal Retirement Accounts
(PRAs) is a top priority of the Administration. The President recently endorsed “progressive indexation” of
benefits, which maintains indexation formulas for low-wage workers but slow benefit growth for higherincome workers, and could eliminate some three-quarters of Social Security’s 75-year funding gap. The
President has expressed a willingness to adopt additional measures to eliminate the remaining funding gap.
PRAs would reduce the size of the current Social Security system. Individuals could direct up to 4 percentage
points of their Social Security payroll contributions into PRAs, and have their traditional Social Security
benefits scaled back using a 3 percent offset rate. PRA payments would be phased in gradually and individuals
would not be able to borrow against PRAs. To minimize risks and administrative costs, PRAs would have strict
guidelines, including limited investment options and obligatory annuitization at retirement.
Several industrial countries, facing fiscal pressures from aging populations, have moved toward partially
privatized, multi-tier pension systems. Australia, Canada, Sweden, and the United Kingdom have adopted
pension systems comprising a public minimum safety net supplemented by various types of vehicles invested
by professional asset managers—employment-based retirement accounts that are mandatory in Australia and
Canada and voluntary in the United Kingdom, and income-based mandatory accounts in Sweden.2 In all
countries, the public system is supplemented by a number of tax-preferred private and corporate retirement
accounts. A number of emerging market economies, following the lead of Chile, have also introduced pension
systems that rely fully on private retirement accounts.
Such pension reforms have successfully reduced long-term unfunded liabilities, but concerns about the
adequacy of private savings have been an issue in many countries.3 Most countries supplemented partial
privatization efforts with some benefit modification, significantly reducing public pension liabilities. While
Australia’s mandatory second tier has boosted overall national saving, voluntary private retirement accounts
have generated limited retirement savings, reflecting low opt-in rates and insufficient investment expertise of
account owners, while high management costs—particularly in systems with less regulation of accounts—have
reduced returns. Insufficient private savings may leave some population groups vulnerable to a loss of income
at old age, with potential consequences for public finances and the social safety net.

In Sweden, income-based individual accounts are notional—i.e. although contributions are being credited to
individual accounts, funds are being used to pay benefits to current retirees.

37.
Officials emphasized that raising the personal saving rate was a core objective of
the Administration’s plans for tax reform. Tax rates had been lowered significantly on
dividends and capital gains, and the Administration supported the complete elimination of
the double taxation of the returns to saving. Also, the FY 2006 budget included proposals to
consolidate, simplify, and extend existing tax-preferred saving schemes. There were also
encouraging signs that key members of Congress would seek to develop a plan that would
address tax and Social Security reform in a comprehensive manner that both strengthened
individual incentives for saving for retirement security, bolstered regulations governing
corporate pension plans, and placed the public pension system on a sustainable footing.
38.
The mission cautioned that fiscal incentives would be most effective in raising
national saving if they were fully financed. As elaborated in Chapter 8 of the Selected Issues
paper, reducing the double taxation of capital income would not necessarily raise national
saving and investment unless fiscal revenue losses were offset. The staff also cautioned that
the Administration’s promotion of an “ownership society”—intended to increase share
ownership among U.S. citizens—would increasingly shift financial risks on to households
already facing reductions in coverage by employer health and defined-benefit (DB) pension
plans. Against this background, the mission welcomed recent efforts to promote the use of
automatic enrollment and default investment options in private pension plans.

- 26 -

39.
Staff and officials concurred that there was considerable scope for reducing
complexity and inefficiencies in the tax system.11 The U.S. tax system has higher statutory
tax rates and lower revenue yields than the OECD average, reflecting widespread personal
and corporate income tax preferences. These account for about 40 percent of potential tax
revenue, and include significant preferences for employer-provided medical insurance,
pension contributions, and charitable giving. In particular, the mission noted that tax benefits
for housing—including interest mortgage deductibility, the treatment of property taxation,
and capital gains—were the most generous in the G-7 and helped to explain the relatively
high ratio of U.S. residential to business investment.
40.
Officials expected the President’s Tax Advisory Panel to provide suggestions for
significant tax reforms, including base broadening to offset the costs of eliminating the
AMT. They noted that the costs of replacing future AMT revenues were substantial and
would rise rapidly over time. Therefore, the panel’s report—due in September—would likely
need to recommend cutbacks in major tax expenditures, although the panel had been charged
with taking into account “the importance of homeownership and charity in American
society.”

E. Financial Sector and Trade Issues
42.
The U.S. financial sector remains resilient and well regulated. At the time of the
discussions, supervisory officials were satisfied by the increase in interest rate spreads,

particularly on high yield instruments, from surprisingly low earlier levels. They explained
that consumer business had been a major source of bank revenues, with strong gains from
home-equity loans and mortgage servicing offsetting slower growth of credit card loans and
mortgage originations.
43.
Risks to banks from a correction
in housing markets were judged relatively
low. Despite froth in some regional
markets and increasing use of riskier
mortgage products, such as interest-only
and adjustable rate loans, trends on a
national level were less of a concern and
loan portfolios were well diversified
geographically. Supervisory agencies
indicated they were close to finalizing a
guidance note (subsequently issued in
May) requiring banks to strengthen risk
management with regard to riskier
mortgage products, a move welcomed by
staff.
44.
The mission also discussed other
efforts to improve supervision in the bank
and nonbank sector:

Government-sponsored housing enterprises (GSEs). The mission supported the

subsequently taken up this issue, but draft legislation has not included adequate
measures to limit the size of GSE portfolios.

Insurance. Following the recent discovery of irregularities in the insurance sector,
the mission inquired whether there was a need for a national approach to regulating
systematically important insurance companies, which presently fall under state
jurisdiction. The officials responded that state supervision appeared to be adequate
and that there was a strong and effective working relationship between federal and
state supervisors.

45.
The authorities welcomed recent progress made in the Doha Round negotiations,
but cautioned that key issues remained unresolved. Officials were pleased with the fresh
momentum behind agricultural discussions following the resolution of differences over the
conversion of specific into ad valorem tariffs. Priorities now were to secure sharp reductions
in agricultural tariffs among the large industrial and developing countries, while minimizing
the list of sheltered products, and achieving progress in other areas, notably non-agricultural
market access and services. Outstanding issues would have to be largely settled before the
WTO’s ministerial meeting in Hong Kong if the Round was to conclude in 2006.
46.
Officials hoped for higher-quality offers in the WTO services negotiations,
particularly from developing countries. In order to speed the progress of negotiations, the
Administration was exploring ways to streamline the cumbersome request-offer process,
including through the design of benchmark offers of varying ambition. Officials indicated
that U.S. flexibility on liberalizing services requiring the temporary movement of natural
persons—an area of particular interest to developing countries—was severely constrained by
immigration and security concerns.

- 29 -

47.
The authorities reiterated that U.S. free trade agreements (FTAs) were an effective
means for promoting multilateral trade liberalization. Officials emphasized that these were
comprehensive in scope, including ambitious commitments for most goods and setting a high
standard for multilateral negotiations. The mission stressed the importance of ensuring that
this approach did not undermine the fabric of the multilateral trading system, which was
based on non-discrimination. There was also a risk of complicating the administration of
trade and taxing the limited negotiating capacities of countries to the detriment of the Doha
Round.
48.
The staff expressed concerns over rising protectionist sentiment in the U.S.
Congress. Officials cautioned that containing protectionist sentiment on Capitol Hill would
be difficult without a change in Chinese exchange rate policy. In response to surging textile
imports from China after quotas expired at end-2004, the United States had introduced
safeguard measures on seven textile products in May. Officials emphasized that these were
compatible with the protocol for China’s WTO accession and preferable to self-imposed
export restraints by China or recent measures proposed in Congress. The mission noted that
the impact of China-specific safeguards on U.S. manufacturers was uncertain, given that
Chinese imports appeared to have displaced primarily suppliers from other foreign
countries.12
49.
Officials noted the rise in the U.S. ODA/GNI ratio while observing there were other
channels for foreign assistance. The ODA/GNI ratio had jumped to 0.16 percent in 2004, up
from 0.11 in 2001. While this partly reflected spending on Iraq and Afghanistan, underlying
funding had increased, and the Administration remained committed to maintaining the
assistance provided by USAID even as the Millennium Challenge Account was becoming
operational. In response to the staff’s observation on the relatively low level of the U.S.
ODA/GNI ratio, the authorities noted that U.S. assistance to foreign countries was several
times higher once sizeable private donations and outlays such as defense were taken into
account.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
50.
The United States has continued to be the main locomotive of global growth, and
nearer term prospects appear broadly favorable. There have been signs in recent months
that the pace of expansion has eased somewhat, and concerns about the record-low household
saving rate endure. Nonetheless, growth is likely to remain slightly above trend as inflation
pressures appear to have been contained despite the rise in world oil prices. U.S. growth is
again expected to outperform the rest of the G-7 in 2005.
51.
Looking forward, however, U.S. policymakers face important challenges. The
United States’ heavy reliance on foreign saving and the still-large fiscal deficit have
12

See Chapter 7 of IMF Country Report 04/228. The mission also cited evidence that Chinese competition
primarily affected U.S. producers through lower unit prices, which would not be reversed by import constraints.

- 30 -

contributed to global current account imbalances and fears of systemic risks, especially if
U.S. productivity growth were to falter. In concert with the adoption of structural reforms
and greater exchange rate flexibility abroad, the critical priority for the United States is
ambitious fiscal consolidation coupled with measures to ensure the long-term sustainability
of public health and retirement systems.
52.
The Federal Reserve’s gradual and flexible approach to monetary tightening has
been been effective. Interest rate hikes have been coupled with clear messages that more
forceful action would be required if price pressures continued to intensify, which has helped
anchor inflation expectations and allowed a gradual pace of tightening. Looking forward,
however, monetary conditions still appear accomodative and—especially against the
background of low unemployment, the recent rise in unit labor costs, and house price
inflation—a more aggressive pace of interest rate hikes cannot be ruled out.
53.
The Federal Open Market Committee has recently taken the welcome step of
debating the merits of a more explicit inflation objective. The Federal Reserve is already
among the most transparent central banks in the world. Nonetheless, the experience in other
countries suggests that a clearer definition of the central bank’s inflation objective can help
further anchor inflation expectations and long-term bond yields, without unduly constraining
the ability of policymakers to meet shorter-term stabilization objectives.
54.
The Administration’s call for deficit reduction is welcome, but more ambitious
efforts appear warranted, especially in the face of looming demographic pressures.
Encouragingly, revenues have strengthened and may again contribute to a better-thanexpected fiscal outcomes this year. Nonetheless, budget targets for next year and beyond
would yield relatively modest adjustments in the government’s structural position, and even
these gains may be difficult to achieve given the expected reliance on an unprecedented
compression in nondefense discretionary spending. It would be particularly worrisome if the
U.S. fiscal deficit and debt remained high until the end of the decade, just as the pressures on
entitlement programs from the baby boom generation begin to intensify.
55.
The current favorable growth conjuncture suggests room for bolder deficit
reduction over the coming years. Achieving a balanced budget excluding Social Security
early in the next decade would support national saving, domestic investment, and the external
position, forming an important pillar in the international strategy for reducing external
imbalances. Most importantly, significantly lowering the federal debt ratio over time would
provide room to cope with impending pressures on health and retirement programs and
reduce the burden on future generations.
56.
Expenditure discipline will be an essential part of any deficit reduction, but tax
reform should also play a role in supporting fiscal sustainability. The magnitude of the
fiscal adjustment needed and the strict spending discipline already assumed make it seem
prudent to explore options for revenue enhancements. To avoid having to unwind recent cuts
in tax rates, consideration should be given to broadening the income tax base—by curbing
deductions, such as the generous treatment of mortgage interest—or to taxing consumption

- 31 -

more directly in the form of a national consumption or energy tax. A legislated budget rule
could also help support fiscal responsibility, and re-authorization of the Budget Enforcement
Act (BEA) provisions—including pay-as-you-go provisions that cover revenue measures—
would seem appropriate.
57.
Demographic and other pressures imply that Medicare outlays are on an
unsustainable path. Administration proposals and the provisions of the 2003 Medicare
Modernization Act could help moderate price pressures. However, with the Medicaid system
under similar strains, a large uninsured population, growing numbers of the elderly, and a
projected tripling of public health care outlays as a ratio to GDP in coming decades, further
steps are urgently needed to improve the efficiency of the health care system. Indeed, given
similar pressures being faced by the private health care sector, a broader reform effort may be
required.
58.
Encouraging steps have been taken to address the solvency of the Social Security
system. The Administration has helpfully offered support to one proposal for slowing the
growth of benefits, and relatively modest additional measures would be required to eliminate
the system’s underfunding and to ensure a positive cash flow over the foreseeable future. The
Administration’s proposal for personal retirement accounts (PRAs) would not help place the
system on a sustainable basis and would significantly raise federal deficits and debt in
coming decades, and it will be important to combine PRAs with a comprehensive plan to
ensure the long-run solvency of the Social Security system. The key priority is to avoid
delays in reforms that fully fund the system, since this would only increase the adjustments
that will eventually be needed.
59.
Structural reforms to support saving and capital accumulation would help sustain
high labor productivity growth. The steady decline in coverage by defined-benefit pension
plans and employer-sponsored health care plans in recent years has meant that financial risks
carried by households have already been increasing. This suggests the importance of public
policies that encourage appropriate saving decisions, including by promoting retirement
plans in which participation is the default option.
60.
The U.S. financial sector has proven exceptionally resilient in recent years, but
there remains scope for further reform. The Administration has placed an appropriate
emphasis on strengthening pension funding and improving supervision and shrinking the
balance sheets of the housing government sponsored enterprises (GSEs). At the same time,
recent irregularities in the insurance sector suggest that there may be a need for supervision
of systemically important entities at a national level. Recent regulatory moves to tighten
lending standards on mortgage instruments are appropriate, particularly given signs that
home prices may be exceeding equilibrium levels in some parts of the country.
61.
As demonstrated by its role in securing last year’s framework agreement for the
Doha Round, the United States is an important leader in the quest for global trade
liberalization. Administration proposals for deep reductions in agricultural and nonagricultural tariffs, as well as plans to offer and elicit stronger commitments for liberalization

- 32 -

in services, have been particularly helpful. At the same time, care should be taken to ensure
that the U.S. strategy of negotiating a large number of bilateral free trade agreements is
consistent with the multilateral trading system. It is also critically important to ensure that the
authorities resist protectionism—including in the wake of the expiration of textiles quotas—
which is not in the interest of U.S. consumers or the rest of the world.
62.
Recent increases in U.S. official development assistance (ODA) and progress on the
Millennium Challenge Account are welcome. However, U.S. ODA relative to GNI remains
among the lowest across industrial countries, arguing for continued efforts to boost U.S.
foreign assistance.
63.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place within the standard
12-month cycle.

APPENDIX III

United States—Debt Sustainability
1.
This appendix subjects projections for U.S. public debt and external debt to a series
of macroeconomic stress tests. The first set of tests follows the methodology prescribed in
“Assessing Sustainability,” (www.imf.org, May 28, 2002), in which baseline trajectories for
these debt variables are determined by setting key macroeconomic variables, including the
primary fiscal deficit and the non-interest current account at values projected by staff. The
fiscal and external baselines are then subjected to two-standard deviation shocks in domestic
interest rates, real growth, inflation, real exchange rates, primary fiscal deficit (government
debt only) and non-interest current account (external debt only), each lasting two years.
2.
The exercise focuses on short- to medium-term vulnerabilities for the general
government. Accordingly, net general government debt is defined by combining the net
financial liabilities of federal, state, and local government debt to the public (that is,
excluding government debt held by the social insurance trust funds). On the external side,
staff uses gross external liabilities as the measure of the stock of external financing.
3.
In all but one case shocks to the fiscal baseline initially boost public debt, but then
resume the downward trend of the baseline scenario (Table 1a and figure 1a). Shocks
lasting two years in interest rate, primary balance, real exchange rate, and flow of liabilities
(shock lasting one year) reveal no persistence in the net government debt-to-GDP ratio after
the first two years. Only a shock to real growth presents a persistence problem that may
require alternative policy actions.
4.
U.S. external debt appears resilient to shocks in real growth and domestic prices
(Table 1b and figure 2a). Shocks in the first two years raise the debt ratio, but it then resumes
the trend of the baseline forecast. The interest rate shock also initially raises the level of
external debt, but following the shock, debt levels then rise slower than in all other scenarios
including the baseline.
5.
Alternative stress tests using vector autoregressions (VAR) found persistent shocks
to growth and inflation to pose greater threats to domestic debt sustainability than interest
rates. The staff used a VAR to estimate the impact of growth, inflation and interest shocks on
government net debt. A persistent one standard deviation increase in short term interest rates
initially accelerates debt accumulation faster than similarly calibrated higher inflation or
lower growth, but then stabilizes with debt at 69 percentage points of GDP, whereas
persistent shocks to growth and inflation imply continuing increases in government debt over
the medium term (figure 1b). Staff also used the VAR model to estimate a 95 percent
confidence interval from all macroeconomic shocks included in the VAR (growth, inflation,
short- and long-term interest rates, general government fiscal balance, and real effective
exchange rates). This experiment suggests that more temporary shocks imply relatively
limited risks to the government debt path, with uncertainty of around +/- 5 percentage points
of GDP after 5 years.

- 36 -

APPENDIX III

6.
The external sector VAR finds that persistent real effective exchange rate shocks
could marginally worsen the U.S. debt position while higher inflation or lower growth may
actually improve the debt profile. For this exercise, staff used the net international investment
position (IIP) to better control for the outflow of investment funds by U.S. nationals relative
to the financing needs of the current account (figure 2b). Given susceptibility of net
international investment position to interest rate, growth, inflation, and real exchange rate
shocks, the VAR estimates a 95% confidence interval of +/- 6 percentage points of GDP in
the fifth year of the staff forecast.

1a. Static stress tests indicates general government net debt
ratio is most susceptible to a sudden increase in debt flows.

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
9/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
10/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
4/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
5/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain
at their levels of the last projection year.

B1. Nominal interest rate is at historical average plus two standard deviations in 2005 and 2006
B2. Real GDP growth is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2005 and 2006
B3. Change in US dollar GDP deflator is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2005 and 2006
B4. Non-interest current account is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2005 and 2006
B5. Combination of B1-B4 using one standard deviation shocks
B6. One time 30 percent nominal depreciation in 2005

APPENDIX IV

Alternative Scenario of the Impact of Fund Policy Advice
To assess the potential impact of Fund policy advice, staff used the Global Fiscal Model
(GFM) to simulate a permanent 4 percent of GDP improvement in the fiscal deficit
building over 5 years. As discussed further in Chapters 5 and 8 of the Selected Issues paper,
GFM is a model developed in the Fund to examine the impact of fiscal policy. It features
liquidity constraints consumers and forward-looking individuals who have a wedge between
their discount rate and the real short-term interest rate, as well as monopolistic competition
and real rigidities, but currently does not include nominal rigidities.
The simulation assumes that labor taxes are raised so as to strengthen the fiscal balance
by a percentage point of GDP a year between 2006 and 2009. Over time, as interest costs
fall, the labor tax rate is reduced to maintain a constant improvement in the deficit. As a
crude adjustment for the impact of nominal rigidities, responses in 2006 were reduced by
two-thirds and in 2007 by one-third, except for the impact on the budget deficit. Monetary
policy is assumed to aim at stabilizing activity and prices.
As can be seen in the Table, the impact on real activity of this fiscal consolidation path is
limited. Growth falls by around ¼ percent a year for the first three years, and then starts to
recover as the significant fall in consumption is largely offset by higher investment and
stronger net exports. There are significant improvements in government and international
indebtedness. By 2010, government debt is some 13 percentage points below its baseline
value and net foreign assets are some 7 percentage points of GDP higher.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
July 22, 2005

1.
This note reports on information that has become available since the staff report
was issued. The topics covered include the budget outlook, legislative developments, and
recent economic and financial market developments. They do not affect the staff appraisal.
Recent economic and financial market developments
2.
Recent developments have been favorable, reducing concerns of a soft patch in
activity. June payroll employment continued its recent steady progress, rising by 146,000
(1¼ percent on an annualized basis) while the unemployment rate fell 0.1 percentage points
to 5 percent. In the same month, industrial production and retail sales increased by a largerthan-anticipated 0.9 percent and 1.7 percent (month-on-month), respectively, and relatively
strong export growth as well as the benefit from a temporary dip in oil prices helped reduce
the trade deficit to $55.3 billion in May from the previous month’s $56.9 billion. Consumer
and producer sentiment have also improved.
3.
Inflation pressures appear to be contained. The June 12-month increase in overall
and core consumer prices moderated to 2.5 percent and 2.1 percent, respectively, both below
market expectations. Similarly, headline and core producer price inflation fell to 3.6 percent
and 2.2 percent, respectively, and spreads between conventional and inflation-indexed 10year bonds declined slightly to around 2¼ percent.
4.
These developments have elicited limited financial market responses. Long-term
bond yields have increased by about ¼ percentage point to around 4¼ percent on stronger
growth prospects. Market expectations about the Federal Reserve’s policy course have
remained largely unchanged, with a further 75 basis points of tightening expected by end2005. Stock prices have strengthened somewhat, and—after some appreciation in early
July—the dollar has returned to its June level.
Monetary, fiscal and legislative developments
5.
The Federal Reserve’s semi-annual Monetary Policy Report (MPR) was presented
to Congress yesterday by Chairman Greenspan. The MPR projects core PCE inflation will
remain below 2 percent and economic growth will be sustained at around 3½ percent this
year and next, assuming no further oil price spikes. With economic slack diminishing, the
Chairman indicated that further monetary tightening would likely be necessary.
6.
Recent budget data suggest a more favorable budget outlook for the current year
(FY 2005, ending September 30) and beyond. Reflecting strong and broad-based revenue
growth through June, the Administration’s Mid-Session Review lowered the projected
unified deficit for this year to $333 billion (2¾ percent of GDP), compared with the February
estimate of $412 billion (3½ percent of GDP). Stronger revenues have also led to a reduction

-2-

in anticipated deficits of around ½ percent of GDP in subsequent years. Consequently, after
remaining at 2¾ percent of GDP in FY 2006, the unified federal deficit is now projected to
fall to almost 1 percent of GDP by FY 2010, even including some costs in FY 2009 and
FY 2010 from the assumed introduction of Personal Retirement Accounts.
7.
Limited further progress has been made on moving ahead with Social Security
reform. A consensus has yet to emerge in Congress on steps to reduce the Social Security
system’s actuarial deficit or whether Personal Retirement Accounts (PRAs) should be
introduced, and debate on reform options has been postponed until after the August recess.
8.
Legislative work on corporate pensions, energy policy, and the Central America
Free Trade Agreement continues. A reconciliation of energy bills passed by the two
chambers is underway. A corporate pension reform bill that would tighten defined-benefit
pension funding requirements is on track for a vote by the full House. The Central America
Free Trade Agreement has passed the Senate, but has yet to be voted on in the House.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with the
United States
On July 22, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the United States.1
Background
The U.S. economy has continued to lead the global recovery over the last year. Output growth
had been slowed by the effects of the bursting of the IT bubble and geopolitical developments
following the 2001 terrorist attacks, but household spending has remained robust and business
investment has rebounded, supported by low interest rates. Despite having eased somewhat
as the expansion has matured, productivity growth has remained well above longer-term
trends and supported record-high corporate profits.
The economy has proved resilient in the face of high energy prices. After expanding at a
4½ percent rate in 2004, real GDP growth eased to 3¾ percent in the first quarter of 2005.
Some further softening may have taken place in the second quarter, but recent indicators
suggest that activity will regain momentum in the second half. In particular, domestic demand
remains solid, based on steady employment gains, a firming of business sentiment,
investment, and improving consumer confidence.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2As economic slack has narrowed, the inflation environment has become less benign. Although
the core deflator for personal consumption expenditure—the Federal Reserve’s preferred
inflation indicator—has risen only modestly to just above 1½ percent (12-month rate), higher
energy prices pushed headline CPI inflation to 2½ percent in recent months. The labor market
has exhibited few signs of overheating—employment growth has been moderate by historical
standards and the drop in the unemployment rate to 5 percent appears to have largely
reflected lower participation. However, slower productivity growth since mid-2004 has
contributed to an acceleration in unit labor costs.
The policy focus in the United States has appropriately shifted toward the removal of stimulus.
Having cut the federal funds rate aggressively over the downturn, the Federal Reserve
reversed course in mid-2004 as deflation risks receded, and has since raised the rate by a
cumulative 2¼ percentage points. The Administration has reaffirmed its commitment to
reducing the budget deficit to below 2 percent of GDP by FY2009 through rigorous spending
restraint, and to making earlier tax cuts permanent.
The U.S. expansion and low interest rates have provided a substantial boost to the rest of the
world at a time of significant global slack. U.S. net imports have increased growth in the rest of
the world by about ¼ percentage point a year since 2001. U.S. financial conditions have also
helped compress risk premiums, lowering interest spreads and supporting activity across a
wide range of emerging markets.
The current account deficit has steadily widened, however, as U.S. growth has continued to
outpace that of most trading partners. Despite the depreciation of the U.S. dollar by about
12 percent in real effective terms over the past three years, the current account deficit
increased to a record 6½ percent of GDP in the first quarter of 2005. This has been mainly
driven by sustained strong growth in real imports of consumption goods and higher oil prices.
Financial flows in the United States have also departed from long-term trends and appear
unsustainable, with foreign savings and corporate profits increasingly financing government
and household spending.
•

The counterpart of the current account deficit has been massive foreign capital inflows,
with U.S. net international liabilities estimated to have risen to over 20 percent of GDP.

•

Net lending by the corporate sector is also at record highs. Notwithstanding difficulties with
auto and airline sectors, businesses have used high profits to strengthen balance sheets
that—along with foreign inflows—have contributed to low long-term interest rates.

•

Tax cuts and expenditure increases have turned the public sector into a significant
borrower. The federal government budget shifted from a 2½ percent of GDP surplus in
FY 2000 to a 3½ percent of GDP deficit in FY2004, leaving the general government deficit
at 4¼ percent of GDP in calendar year 2004. Reflecting buoyant revenue growth, however,
both deficit measures are expected to continue to improve notably over the medium term.

-3•

The household saving rate has fallen to record lows. Even accounting for the boost from
strong asset markets, the IMF staff estimates that the saving rate is currently some
1½-2 percentage points below a level consistent with household income and wealth.

Barring shocks, the staff projects growth of 3½ percent in 2005 and 2006, slightly above
potential and close to the consensus forecast. Reflecting some rebalancing of growth and
normalizing domestic financial flows, both the personal and national saving rate would
gradually rise while stronger investment would reduce corporate net lending. Although the
trade balance would benefit somewhat from lagged exchange rate effects, the current account
deficit would remain at over 6 percent of GDP (assuming an unchanged real exchange rate) as
increasing foreign debt and higher interest rates would weigh on the income balance.
The financial sector appears well positioned to provide continued support to the recovery.
Equity prices have risen, long-term interest rates remain low, banks are well capitalized and
highly profitable, and indicators of credit quality remain strong. The robust housing market has
caused financial regulators to tighten oversight of home equity and other residential loans.
Notwithstanding strong house price increases in many regions, securitization of mortgage debt
has limited systemic financial sector risks by allowing significant diversification of real estate
exposures.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that, despite higher oil prices, the U.S. economy continues to lead
the global expansion based on strong fundamentals. U.S. productivity growth has remained
well above longer-term trends, supporting corporate profits, a rebound in business investment
spending, and some acceleration in employment. Against this background, the policy focus in
the United States has appropriately shifted toward the removal of policy stimulus.
Directors observed that, while subject to risks, the near-term outlook for the U.S. economy
remains broadly favorable. A moderation in consumption growth as monetary conditions
continue to tighten will likely be largely offset by rising investment and an improvement in real
net exports. However, Directors cautioned that higher oil prices could begin to weigh more
heavily on domestic demand. Many Directors also expressed concern about the rapid inflation
of U.S. house prices in recent years, increased reliance of some households on less
conventional mortgage products, and the already low personal saving rate. In addition,
Directors noted that—with the U.S. external current account deficit expected to remain large
well into the medium term—the staff’s analysis suggests that the level of the U.S. dollar still
remains above that necessary to avoid continuing increases in U.S. net external indebtedness.
Against this background, Directors agreed that this underscores the importance of the
cooperative strategy for addressing global imbalances.
Directors viewed the extremely low U.S. national saving rate as posing a key policy challenge
going forward. In the context of the wide differences in growth across major regions of the
world, this has contributed to a widening of global current account imbalances, which pose
further associated systemic risks, especially if U.S. productivity growth were to falter. Most
Directors accordingly stressed the importance of taking advantage of the present cyclical
strength of the U.S. economy to set in train ambitious fiscal consolidation in coming years

-4which, coupled with reforms to public retirement and health care systems, would help ensure
their sustainability in the face of longer-term demographic pressures. Directors recognized that
fiscal consolidation in the United States should be complemented by appropriate actions in
other regions as part of a shared responsibility.
Against this background, Directors welcomed the commitment to fiscal deficit reduction in the
FY2006 budget and the recent improvement in the budgetary outlook due to strong tax
receipts. Nonetheless, most Directors considered the Administration’s goal of halving the
budget deficit to be relatively unambitious, as this would imply limited adjustment in the
structural fiscal position in coming years. It is also subject to considerable risk, given the
assumption of an unprecedented compression in nondefense discretionary spending.
Many Directors agreed that balancing the budget excluding Social Security by early in the next
decade would support national saving, domestic investment, and the external position.
This approach would significantly lower the federal debt ratio, providing the room to cope with
impending pressures on entitlement programs and improve intergenerational equity.
Most Directors noted that existing fiscal plans already assume strict spending discipline, and
accordingly it would be prudent to explore options for revenue enhancements to support deficit
reduction. To avoid having to unwind recent cuts in tax rates, many Directors felt that
consideration should be given to broadening the income tax base or to taxing consumption
more directly in the form of a national consumption or energy tax. A few noted that a legislated
budget rule would also help support fiscal discipline, and re-authorization of the Budget
Enforcement Act (BEA) provisions—including pay-as-you-go provisions that cover revenue
measures—would be appropriate. Many Directors called for a simplification of the tax system
and welcomed the establishment of the Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform.
Directors recognized the need to address the severe underfunding of the Social Security and,
especially, Medicare systems. While the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act contained a
number of provisions that could help moderate price pressures, the new prescription drug
benefit significantly increases Medicare’s underfunding. Thus, with public health care spending
projected to triple as a ratio to GDP in coming decades, further steps are urgently needed to
improve the efficiency of the overall health care system.
Directors welcomed the Administration’s recent commitment to placing the Social Security
system on a sustainable basis and the proposed introduction of personal retirement accounts
(PRAs). However, they noted that PRAs will not reduce the system’s funding gap, and that it
was important to introduce accompanying measures that would ensure the system’s long-run
solvency. In this regard, they welcomed the Administration’s recent support for specific
measures to reduce the system’s unfunded liabilities, and called for early legislative action to
eliminate the funding shortfall.
Directors commended the Federal Reserve’s gradual and flexible approach to monetary
tightening, which has been effective in supporting activity while preserving price stability.
Interest rate hikes have been coupled with clear messages that more forceful action would be
required if price pressures continued to intensify. Indeed, as monetary conditions still appear

-5accommodative, a more aggressive pace of interest rate hikes could not be ruled out if price
pressures increase.
Directors noted that the Federal Reserve is already among the most transparent central banks
in the world. Drawing on experience in other countries, a few Directors suggested that a
clearer definition of the Federal Reserve’s inflation objective could help further anchor inflation
expectations and long-term bond yields, without unduly constraining the ability of policymakers
to meet shorter-term stabilization objectives. Most Directors agreed, however, that with the
Federal Reserve’s impressive track record of maintaining low inflation and effective
communication on policy intentions with financial markets, the additional gain from establishing
a more explicit inflation objective would be relatively modest.
Directors recognized the importance of structural reforms to support saving, capital
accumulation, and high labor productivity growth. These could include aligning the tax burden
on saving and consumption, and promoting retirement plans in which participation is the
default option.
Directors welcomed the Administration’s recent emphasis on strengthening pension funding
and improving supervision and shrinking the balance sheets of the housing governmentsponsored enterprises (GSEs). At the same time, a few Directors noted that recent
irregularities in the insurance sector suggest that there may be a need for supervision of
systemically important entities at a national level. Finally, Directors welcomed the recent
regulatory moves to tighten lending standards on mortgage instruments.
Directors welcomed Administration proposals for deep cuts in agricultural and non-agricultural
tariffs as part of the Doha Round negotiations, as well as efforts to offer and elicit stronger
commitments for liberalization in services. At the same time, many cautioned that care should
be taken to ensure that the U.S. strategy of negotiating a large number of bilateral free trade
agreements is consistent with the multilateral trading system. Directors emphasized that the
recent protectionist pressures—including in the wake of the expiration of textiles quotas—are
in the interest of neither the United States nor the rest of the world, and should be resisted
vigorously.
Directors praised the recent increases in U.S. official development assistance (ODA), and the
progress on the Millennium Challenge Account. They noted that U.S. ODA levels as a
proportion of Gross National Income (GNI) remain one of the lowest among industrial countries
and encouraged the authorities to further increase flows of such assistance.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
