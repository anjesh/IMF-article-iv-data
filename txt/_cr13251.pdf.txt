STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 12, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context and Outlook: On the back of sizeable fiscal consolidation and low confidence,
the recovery stalled in 2012. Fiscal consolidation remains very substantial in 2013, and
output is projected to contract slightly this year and to grow moderately in 2014.
Structural rigidities in labor and product markets, and comparatively low profit shares,
have undermined the economy’s growth potential and contributed to loss of export
performance. On the positive side, credit conditions remain supportive, and private
demand is unencumbered by balance sheet repair issues and so is more apt to respond
favorably to an improvement in confidence.
Risks: The main risks lie in precarious growth prospects in Europe, a possible resurgence
of financial market stress, domestic policy uncertainty, notably in regard to future fiscal
policy choices, and a stalling of domestic structural reforms. A failure of growth to
recover would make it more difficult to reverse debt dynamics in the short run. Financial
stability risks have abated considerably since the last report, as banks have completed
their deleveraging objectives and strengthened their capital and liquidity buffers. Low
bank profitability remains a risk factor.
Policy Recommendations: With much of the required fiscal consolidation expected to
be completed by 2013, the pace of adjustment should be eased in 2014 relative to
current plans in order to support the recovery. Adjustment should also be rebalanced
toward expenditure containment, with a view to improving the quality of adjustment and
removing policy uncertainty that weighs on private spending decisions. Credible
expenditure containment should be backed by structural fiscal measures: some savings
have been identified and the upcoming pension reform will be a key element of the
strategy, but there is scope to rationalize public spending on a larger scale. The
authorities have given structural reforms an important forward momentum with
measures to improve competitiveness (notably a reduction of the labor tax wedge), a
broad reform to move the labor market toward greater “flexicurity”, planned
improvements in worker training mechanisms and regulatory simplification. The reform
momentum will need to be powered up, by deepening labor market reforms and
opening product markets to greater competition (notably in services) as an important
lever of productivity growth and employment creation. Financial sector policies should
aim at consolidating the significant progress achieved in strengthening financial stability
and preserving the capacity of banks to provide credit as they adapt to new prudential
requirements, notably by better aligning tax incentives on financial products to
regulatory objectives.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. A Hesitant Recovery
1.
Following an initial recovery in 2010–11,
the economy flat lined in 2012, and registered
two quarters of negative growth in 2012Q4 and
2013Q1. While the French economy weathered the
crisis relatively well compared to peers, its
subsequent performance has proven fairly muted,
reflecting the sizeable fiscal consolidation
undertaken since 2010 and a failure of confidence
to recover. Output remains below pre-crisis levels,
with an estimated output gap of -1.8 percent
in 2012.

2.
Private consumption, the main driver of growth in the pre-crisis period, recovered
strongly in 2010 but has since lost steam owing to faltering income growth. In the face of weak
employment growth and rising taxes, household real disposable income contracted by nearly
1 percent in 2012. Its impact on consumption was offset only in part by a decline in the household
saving rate. In 2012 investment also stalled because of low business confidence related to domestic
policy uncertainty and the weak outlook. Since mid 2012, policy uncertainty has been on the rise in
France, in contrast to the European trend. Only exports and government consumption contributed
positively to growth (Figure 1).

3.
After considerable stickiness, inflation has declined at a rapid pace since August 2012
in response to the slack in the economy (Figure 2). Downward pressure on core inflation reflected
in part lower telecommunication prices linked to the entry of a fourth mobile telecommunication
operator. Despite disinflation pressures and the steady rise in unemployment, wage growth has
remained remarkably stable, at around 2 percent year-on-year in 2012. The low sensitivity of wages
to labor market conditions, captured by a relatively flat Phillips Curve, results in part from the
indexation of the minimum wage, which acts as a reference for wage agreements.
4.
Strong fiscal adjustment
in 2012 resulted in a structural
budget improvement of
1.1 percent of GDP, which came
on top of a similar effort in
2011. However, because of a
widening cyclical component, the
2012 deficit declined by only ½
a percent of GDP relative to 2011.
At 4.8 percent of GDP, the 2012
fiscal deficit exceeded the level
projected in the last staff report
by 0.3 percent of GDP owing to
lower-than-projected growth and
exceptional factors (including
recapitalization of Dexia).

5.
With a view to closing the gap relative to the EC’s Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP),
the pace of adjustment was accelerated further under the 2013 budget, with a targeted
structural adjustment of 1.8 percent of GDP. Tax measures are expected to contribute
1.4 percentage points of this adjustment, with the rest coming from a reduction of structural
spending in relation to GDP. In all, the rapid fiscal consolidation of 2011–13 has relied heavily on
revenue measures, with a projected increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio of 3.7 percentage points over 3
years. Over the same period, expenditure growth was also reduced considerably (to an annual real
growth averaging 0.6 against trend growth estimated at 1.5 percent), but the ratio of structural
spending to potential GDP has declined by only 0.3 percentage points.

The external position appears to be moderately weak compared to medium-term
fundamentals. Following a trend deterioration, the current account deficit widened further in 2012
(to 2.2 percent of GDP). This was driven by a drop in net investment income, while the trade deficit
improved slightly, owing to strong sales in aeronautics and a relatively weak cyclical position.1 From
a medium-term perspective, the steady worsening of the current account since the late 1990s
reflects a broad-based erosion of the net trade in goods, only partly offset, recently, by a rising
surplus in services. The IMF External Balance Assessment suggests medium-sized gaps relative to the
current account and real exchange rate “norms,” in the order of 1-3 and 0-5 percent, respectively.2
While external imbalances do not represent an immediate cause of concern, France’s
competitiveness gap constrains its export and growth potential. The large deterioration of France’s
Net International Investment Position (NIIP) since 2007 (from near balance to around -22.5 percent
of GDP) could also affect external sustainability over the medium term. About 55 percent of this
deterioration is due to valuation losses, which could be reversed in a stronger global recovery.

The declining exports performance is reflected in a steady loss of market shares, both
globally and relative to peers. This trend deterioration is confirmed by a number of related
indicators: (i) sizeable declines in the share of manufacturing production and employment; (ii) a
deterioration of cost competitiveness, with wages outpacing productivity growth since the
early 2000s, and unit labor cost levels standing above Germany since the mid-2000s, and more
recently losing ground to the euro area periphery countries; (iii) a low and narrowing of profit shares
in value added.

The gap relative to the NFA stabilizing current account is found to be negligible. The CGER approach yields
somewhat different current account and real exchange rate gaps compared with EBA: the current account gap is
estimated at +1.4 percent of GDP (rather than -2.5 percent under EBA); and real exchange rate overvaluation is
estimated at 4 percent (rather than 1 percent under EBA).

Financial stability risks have abated considerably, but banks’ profitability is relatively
low and they remain exposed to wholesale funding. Banks achieved their deleveraging objectives
in 2012, and are well positioned to meet Basel III capital requirements (Figure 4). In the twelve
months ending in 2012Q3, the four largest banks reduced assets by 2.4 percent and risk-weighted
assets (RWA) by 7.2 percent through disposal of legacy assets, non-core assets (such as trade and
project finance), and subsidiaries in periphery countries. Combined with capital increases (through
retained earnings), these actions led to a 1.5 percentage points average improvement in their core
Tier 1 ratios.3 Liquidity risk has diminished by lessening reliance on US dollar and short-term
wholesale funding and building up liquidity reserves, including borrowing from the European
Central Bank (ECB).4 Liquidity buffers of French banks covered 137 percent of short-term wholesale
funding at end-March 2013 and asset encumbrance remains low (ranging from 20 to 60 percent).
However, while two of the largest banks already meet the target of 100 percent coverage, the Basel
III liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) for the system as a whole still falls short of regulatory requirements
and funding profiles are more vulnerable than those of peers. Continued access to stable sources—
even under difficult market conditions—including private placements, retail sales, and covered
bonds is a mitigating factor. Banks completed between 50 and 67 percent of their planned issuance
programs by April 2013.

The leverage ratio decreased by 3 points from 2011Q3 to 2012Q3. About two-thirds of the decrease in leverage is
ratio reflected in a capital increase and one third in a decrease in assets.

Liquidity reserves comprise central bank deposits and central-bank eligible unencumbered assets. Use of the ECB’s
Long Term Refinancing Operations (LTRO) has decreased by 42 percent since its end-2012 peak to around €101
billion as banks have started repaying loans. Deposits at the ECB peaked at €139 billion in mid-2012 and have since
decreased to €39 billion.

Monetary easing by the European Central Bank (ECB) has been transmitted to
domestic lending rates with no evident credit crunch effect from deleveraging. Banks’
financing conditions improved markedly in 2012, reflecting their swift progress in meeting new
solvency requirements and the positive effect of measures adopted by the ECB. The global rise in
interest rates since the May 2013 trough has raised bank funding costs by about 30 basis points, but
bank yields remain lower than pre-crisis.5 Banks passed on the benefit of lower funding costs to
customers: rates on small business loans have fallen below 3 percent, although recently they have
been rising in real terms because of declining inflation expectations (Figure 4). Existing margins for
the quick disposal of non-core assets enabled banks to achieve their deleveraging goals while
preserving positive domestic credit growth, although those margins have shrunk. While housing
loans and non-financial corporations (NFC) loans continue to expand, consumer credit is
contracting. Low credit expansion appears to reflect subdued loan demand and increased reliance
on market financing by NFCs rather than a tightening of credit conditions (Figure 5).

Other indicators including interbank rates and bank CDS spreads imply currently favorable funding conditions
(Table 5) although recent developments point to higher rate expectations. The EONIA (Euro overnight index
averages) forward rates—especially at longer tenors—have risen sharply since the Fed meeting on June 18 and CDS
spreads have increased by around 15 basis points during the same period.

B. Outlook, Risks and Spillovers
10.
Supported by a recent improvement in leading indicators, the recovery is projected to
unfold gradually in the second half of 2013. Given the impact of fiscal consolidation and low
confidence, real GDP would still contract by 0.2 percent this year, but then grow by 0.8 percent in
2014, under the added stimulus of improved external conditions and supportive monetary policy.
The projected decline in the households’ saving rate (to 15.2 percent in 2013 from 15.6 percent in
2012) should help stabilize consumption in the face of a further fall in disposable income. The
decline of the saving rate is predicated on an improvement in confidence, but also reflects the fact
that tax increases have fallen mostly on higher income households who have a higher capacity to
adjust their saving rate to smooth consumption (Figure 6).

Private demand is unencumbered by balance sheet repair issues and can thus respond
relatively quickly to an improvement in confidence and profit shares. The financial situation of
households and enterprises remains relatively healthy (in an aggregate sense) as measured by debt
ratios. Given relatively low profit shares, enterprises are more dependent on external financing than
enterprises in Germany, for instance, but should be able to mobilize required financing in an upturn.

12.
Low capacity utilization should continue to hold inflation down. The muted increase of
the minimum wage this year (0.3 percent in January 2013) and labor market slack should weigh on
wage growth. Downward pressures on inflation will be partly offset by the anticipated increase in
VAT in 2014 (to finance part of the reduction of the labor tax wedge). In all, headline inflation should
ease to around 1½ percent in 2013–14, down from 2 percent in 2012.

Europe would spill over to France

contrast, growth spillover analysis suggests that French output co-moves less with global output
6

By way of example, the GRAM shock simulation of a protracted period of slower European growth carried out by
RES would result in a growth shortfall for France, averaging -1.75 percentage points over 2014-18. Owing to the debt
overhang on firms’ balance sheets, this scenario entails a 3 percent and 5 percent decline in euro area private
investment (relative to baseline) in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Lower than expected growth outcomes prevent the
anticipated fiscal improvement, pushing up sovereign risk premium and triggering further tightening in fiscal stances.
The magnitudes of the jumps in sovereign risk premium would be proportional to the country’s level of debt and
dependence on foreign funding.

shocks than output of Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, or Germany, for instance.7 Reemergence of
financial stress could impact French sovereign yields and disrupt funding markets even if France has
enjoyed a relatively safe have status. However, exposures of banks have declined relative to the
banking spillover analysis carried out for the last Staff Report.8 Higher funding costs and largerthan-expected provisions against Italian or Spanish exposures could, in turn, undermine banks’
earnings. Notwithstanding wholesale funding exposures, banks have ample collateral to access ECB
financing.
15.
By virtue of their size and interconnectedness, French banks could have potentially
large outward spillover effects. There is no evidence that deleveraging by French banks has so far
created adverse effects on other regions, as banks with stronger balance sheets often stepped in to
fill the gap. However, adverse spillovers could occur if French banks were forced into an accelerated
retrenchment from corporate and investment banking, from retail operations in Italy and Spain, and
from their derivatives business. Staff analysis suggests that financial spillovers to and from French
SIFIs are likely to affect mostly other European SIFIs in the U.K., Belgium, the Southern periphery,
and U.S. banks.9
16.
The main domestic risk is a stalled recovery of private demand. The forecast supposes
that the household saving ratio will continue to decline this and next year. However, uncertainty
over tax and transfer policies during the remaining consolidation period—and lagged effects from
previously implemented austerity—could further delay spending decisions. The recovery could also
be held back if structural reforms are inadequately ambitious. A growth failure in France would have
significant outward spillovers to its neighbors, particularly small open economies in the euro area,
and smaller but still measurable impacts on Italy and Spain.10

their peak in 2011 Q3 (Figure 7). In the
absence of a large confidence shock, the housing valuation gap is expected to close through a very
gradual price correction reflecting favorable demographics, a structural undersupply, and low
household indebtedness. The macroeconomic impact of such a price correction is expected to be
limited given weak wealth effects, reflecting the absence of home equity loans and limited use of
real estate as collateral, generally. The impact on banks should be similarly contained owing to
underwriting criteria that emphasize debt servicing capacity rather than collateral value.12 13 A more
abrupt correction in house prices may lead to further compression in banks’ profit margins.

18.
Market concerns about fiscal sustainability appear to have diminished. While headline
deficit targets have been missed in the face of a stagnating economy, the strong record of structural
adjustment has lent credibility to the authorities’ medium-term commitments. Sovereign yields have
increased by nearly 60 basis points since May trough; interest rate assumption underlying the
baseline projections had incorporporated an increase of about this magnitude. In any event, with an
average maturity of 7 years, sovereign debt dynamics are not very responsive to changes in interest
rates, except in the case of a very extreme shock such as the one illustrated in the Debt
Sustainability Analysis (Appendix IV).

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
19.
Staff Diagnostic: In the face of a trend decline in total factor productivity (TFP) growth since
the 1990s, real wage growth in France has been sustained at the expense of the share of income
going to profits. This shift in the distribution of value added has helped support consumption, but
has also undermined, over time, the capacity of enterprises to innovate and remain competitive in
international markets. Meanwhile, the extensive social insurance and redistribution system, which
has contributed to the economy’s resilience to shocks, has also become more difficult to sustain
since the income base from which it is financed lost buoyancy. The related pressures to correct a
long standing structural fiscal imbalance have so far been met by increasing the tax burden, with a
risk of undermining potential growth.

A. Scope for Easing Fiscal Adjustment, but Refocused on Expenditure
Containment
20.
Faced with lower-than-expected growth in 2013, the authorities decided not to take
additional measures in pursuit of the nominal deficit target, but to allow automatic stabilizers
to work in full. Even so, the degree of adjustment (1.8 percent of GDP in structural terms) remains
large, and staff considered that less front-loading would have been preferable on cyclical grounds.
The authorities explained that fiscal policy decisions for 2013 had been constrained by European
commitments and the need to solidify market confidence. The deficit is projected to decline from
4.8 percent of GDP in 2012 to 3.9 percent in 2013.
21.
Under the Stability Program of April 2013, structural adjustment would remain
substantial in 2014, with a proposed 70 percent contribution from expenditure containment
and 30 percent from revenue measures. Adjustment would moderate thereafter until a small
structural surplus is reached in 2016. The Stability Program is built on more optimistic growth
assumptions than those of staff. Differences in estimated potential GDP and output gaps result in
differences in measured structural fiscal adjustment for the same underlying fiscal effort. These
differences are illustrated in Figure 8. Thus, whereas the Stability Program (blue line in Figure 8)
estimates structural fiscal adjustment to be 1 percent of GDP in 2014, the same underlying effort
produces a structural adjustment of 0.8 when using the staff’s macroeconomic framework (green
line in Figure 8). Similarly, based on the staff’s macroeconomic assumptions, the structural fiscal

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

FRANCE

balance would still be in a deficit of about 0.3 percent of potential GDP in 2016, compared to a
0.2 percent surplus in the authorities’ scenario.
22.
The authorities confirmed that they would henceforth by guided by structural deficit
targets (Box 1). They welcomed the role played by the Fund in swaying the policy debate in this
direction, and underscored that structural deficit targets would not only avoid procyclicality but also
make policy making more predictable. They also stressed the need to maintain potential growth
assumptions unchanged over the policy horizon in order to provide a stable framework for
measuring the fiscal effort. Staff agreed that the metric by which adjustment is measured should be
stable. However, as Figure 8 illustrates, the use of optimistic potential growth assumptions implies
that the medium-term target may not be reached in the intended time frame. As stressed in the
previous consultation, staff suggested that prudent growth assumptions would be preferable since
the implications of an upward revision to potential GDP (e.g., the opening of additional fiscal space)
are much easier to handle than the opposite.15 In its commentary on the Stability Program, the
newly created Fiscal Council also urged the use of less optimistic macroeconomic assumptions in
policy planning.

Box 1. Moving to Structural Fiscal Targets: Framework and Challenges
The October 2012 “organic law” aligning French laws to the requirement of the European Treaty on
Stability, Coordination, and Governance stipulates that the multi-year fiscal laws (Lois de Programmation
des Finances Publiques, LPFP) define annual structural deficit targets (in euros) over a five-year policy
horizon. The LPFP covering 2013–2017, which was adopted in December 2012, is the first LPFP to meet
these criteria and thus sets the annual targets against which performance will be measured until 2017. The
Stability Programs submitted to the European Commission in April can modify the projections but the
structural targets have to remain consistent with the LPFP.
Annual budget laws have to be consistent with the trajectory set in the LPFP. The fiscal council (Haut
Conseil des Finances Publiques, HCPF) established by the organic law has to provide an independent
opinion on the macroeconomic assumption underlying draft budgets and their consistency with the LPFP
targets. The HCPF also verifies ex-post execution of the budget and issues an alert if the fiscal outturn
deviates from the medium-term trajectory by more than 0.5 percent of GDP in one year or cumulatively
over two subsequent years. The Government then has to implement corrective measures.
In order to monitor performance under this framework, structural targets should ideally only reflect policy
choices and not revisions of potential GDP.1 For this reason, the authorities and the HCFP have decided to
monitor future fiscal performance based on the potential GDP as estimated in the last LPFP, regardless of
future revisions to potential GDP.
Even for a given level of potential GDP, revisions in national accounts can affect the measurement of
structural fiscal deficits. For instance, the recent upward revision of the 2011 GDP (and associated revision
of the output gap) mechanically increased the 2012 structural deficit by 0.3 points. Following this revision,
no corrective measures have been recommended for 2012, but it will be up to the HCFP to advise whether
this deviation, together with the 2013 fiscal outturn, calls for a correction.

for 2011 was revised from 3.7 percent to 4.9 percent of potential GDP owing to a change in the estimated potential
GDP.

Staff recommended easing somewhat the pace of fiscal consolidation in 2014 relative
to the Stability Plan in order to support the uncertain recovery. The structural adjustment
expected to be completed over 2011-13 (4 percentage points of GDP) covers 2/3 of the estimated
cumulative effort needed to reach the medium-term structural balance objective. Given this track
record, and in order not to undermine the fragile recovery, staff recommended retaining only the
expenditure containment part (i.e., 70 percent) of the adjustment proposed for 2014 under the
Stability Program (red line in Figure 8). This would deliver structural adjustment of 0.5 percent of
GDP in 2014. The foregone adjustment in 2014 (0.3 percent of GDP) is relatively small and would be
recovered by maintaining a steady pace of structural adjustment over a longer period of time than
envisaged under the Stability Program (Figure 8).

Staff stressed that the move to structural deficit targeting should also be the occasion
for anchoring medium-term adjustment to an explicit expenditure norm while stabilizing the
tax burden. As noted above, tax measures have raised the tax burden to 46 percent of GDP, one of
the highest levels in Europe. The perceived risk that taxation will rise further appears to be one of
the factors holding back spending by households and enterprises. Staff emphasized the importance
of targeting more explicitly expenditure growth at the general government level to strengthen fiscal
credibility and improve the growth potential. Staff noted that the pace of public expenditure growth
implied by the Stability Program for 2014-15 (0.4 percent in real terms in 2014 and 0.2 percent in
2015) was appropriate. Combined with a stabilization of the revenue-to-GDP ratio at its 2013 level,
this expenditure path would result in a
Debt-to-GDP ratio
deficit of around 3½ percent of GDP in
2014 and under 3 percent in 2015,
consistent with the recent proposed
recommendations of the European
Commission. Real expenditure growth
could then be capped at around
0.3 percent a year until the structural
budget balance objective is reached in
2017, i.e., one year later than
envisaged by the authorities. The
debt-to-GDP ratio would peak in 2014
at 95 percent of GDP. Because of the
sensitivity of the debt path to growth

outcomes (Appendix IV), stronger expenditure containment might become necessary over the
medium term.
25.
The authorities confirmed that the adjustment effort would be rebalanced toward
expenditure containment starting in 2014, but that revenue measures may still be necessary.
They noted that reducing tax expenditures could be an efficient adjustment instrument, even
though it would raise the tax-to-GDP ratio, as in the case of the recently announced reduction in the
family tax allowance. Furthermore, reducing tax expenditures was, in many cases, akin to reducing
transfers in terms of its economic impact. At the same time, the authorities have stated that they
would stabilize tax incentives pertaining to enterprises in order to reduce tax uncertainty.
26.
Delivering the ambitious degree of expenditure containment embedded in the
Stability Program for 2014 and 2015 (and supported by staff) depends on identifying
structural spending measures that can be deployed over time. The proposed expenditure path
represents a significant departure from trend expenditure growth which the authorities estimate at
around 1.5 percent annually. Given the structure of government spending, the public sector wage
bill and social transfers will need to bear much of the adjustment. Pushed by the expansion of
spending by local governments and state agencies (ODAC), the general government wage stands
above 13 percent of GDP (2 points higher than the EU average) with no clear downward trend. Also,
the pursuit of social objectives has pushed social transfers to the highest level among OECD
countries (in terms of GDP). However, social outcomes are not uniformly better than in the rest of
the OECD, which suggests that the social protection objectives of public policy could be achieved
more efficiently.16 Staff noted that the Audit Court (Cour des comptes) has identified and
documented potentially large efficiency gains in the public sector (education, firm subsidies, health,
professional training, and housing subsidies) which could guide future government policies.

27.
The authorities underlined that
a number of reforms in progress
would sustain expenditure
containment. They noted that
expenditure norms were already in effect
at the central government level and for
health spending. Ongoing cuts in
transfers to local governments would
reduce their resources by 0.2 percent of
GDP by 2015. The inter-ministerial
committee charged with rationalizing
public policies (Modernisation de l’ action
publique, i.e., MAP) would be the main
instrument to identify future expenditure
measures. The MAP is currently reviewing policies accounting for 20 percent of government
spending. The government has also announced its intention to reform the pension and
unemployment insurance systems by year end, with a view to closing the deficit of the pension
system by 2020 (0.8 percent of GDP).

B. A Multi-Pronged Structural Reform Strategy to Revive Growth
28.
The overarching objective of structural policies should be to close the gap between the
cost of labor and productivity and to increase activation of underused labor resources. The
preferred outcome would be to raise productivity and reduce the non-wage cost of hiring and doing
business by removing rigidities in the labor market and obstacles to competition in product markets.
To the extent that the wage-productivity gap is too large to be closed by acting on these levers,
however, an adjustment in wages may be necessary. There is also scope to generate growth by
increasing incentives to seek employment and remain in the labor force.
29.
The authorities have undertaken reforms on a broad front to meet these objectives
(Appendices III and IV). They shared the mission’s diagnostic that the institutional and regulatory
environment in which enterprises operate needs to be more supportive of investment and growth
and that direct and implicit costs need to be reduced to restore profits shares. They underscored the
actions taken to improve cost competitiveness (reduction of the labor tax wedge) and reduce labor
market rigidities (labor market reform), as well as planned reforms to strengthen labor training and
simplify regulations. The authorities had not yet decided on an approach to product market reform.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Labor market policies and reforms
30.
A significant competitiveness boost has been provided by the reduction of the labor
tax wedge which is expected to cut labor costs by about 3 percent by 2015.17 The related
increase in profit margins should enable enterprises to improve competitiveness through lower
prices or through investment. The budgetary cost of the measure (about 1 percent of GDP) will be
split evenly between lower expenditure and higher other taxes (VAT and yet-to-be-identified
environmental taxes).
31.
The broad labor market agreement negotiated by social partners and its transposition
into law represent a very significant step toward flexicurity (Box 2). The authorities pointed out
that the success of the negotiations opened the door to a more collaborative relation between
social partners and thus better labor market outcomes. The government’s decisions to adopt the
agreement without any changes gives it added legitimacy. The reform creates flexibility for firms
under economic pressure to renegotiate (within certain limits) wages and working hours. It also aims
at reducing labor market duality by encouraging a shift from reliance on short-term contracts as the
primary labor market shock absorber to a model where regular (open-ended) contracts provide
sufficient flexibility to accommodate shocks. The extent to which the flexibility provisions of the law
will increase incentives to hire and reduce the duality of the labor market depends in large part on
implementation and the effective reduction of judicial uncertainty associated with labor disputes.
The authorities emphasized that this reform should be allowed to bear fruit before contemplating
additional reforms. Staff noted that the reform goes in the right direction but would need to go
further to effectively reduce labor market duality.

17

As explained in IMF Country Report 12/342, the measure was implemented through a tax credit based on the wage
bill (Crédit d’impôt pour la compétitivité et l’emploi, CICE), rather than a reduction of social security contributions,
although the economic impact is the same.

Box 2. Labor Market Reform on a Forward Momentum
The role of social partners. In the face of poor labor market outcomes (e.g., rising structural unemployment
and a dysfunctional dual labor market), the new government decided to launch a broad reform in July 2012. To
give the reform legitimacy and weight, it tasked social partners to negotiate a deal. The resulting agreement of
January 2013 (Accord National Interprofessionnel, or ANI), was signed by a majority of the unions and of
employers’ federations, and was transposed into law in May. It is the broadest labor market reform since the
1980s, and the successful negotiation marks a very significant improvement in labor market relations (top right
chart below).
The reform. The reform trades off more flexibility in adjusting working conditions at the enterprise level for
enhanced security and training opportunities for employees. By reducing the (implicit) cost of labor, the
flexibility provisions should increase firms’ incentives to hire. Greater security for workers can be expected to
translate into higher and better training (both in the workplace and during job transitions), raising productivity
growth.
The flexibility part of the agreement has two main components:

Internal flexibility: To preserve jobs in the face of a downturn, the “agreements on safeguarding jobs”
allow companies to negotiate a reduction of working hours and/or wages (no lower than 1.2 times the
minimum wage) during a maximum period of two years. Any employee that refuses the agreement can be
dismissed under simplified dismissal procedures. Internal mobility within companies under restructuring is
facilitated by removing formal redundancy procedures (which prevent the transfer of workers across units).

External flexibility: Both collective and individual dismissals will be eased. Owing to a very complex
labor code, long prescription periods, and lengthy judicial processes, France’s job protection system has been
particularly cumbersome. There is ample evidence that legal uncertainty over dismissals inhibits hiring by firms,
besides acting as a hindrance to competitiveness.1 Following the reform, redundancy plans will be decided by
collective agreement and endorsed by the labor ministry within short delays. Although workers will still be able
to challenge collective dismissal in court, the prescription period is shortened from 12 to 2 months. On
individual dismissals, the agreement facilitates conciliation by setting benchmark compensations for
separations, which should help reach settlements and shorten legal procedures.
The security dimension of the agreement expands health and unemployment insurance, provides for more
effective training, and discourages the use of fixed-term contracts to reduce labor market duality, all of which
should improve economic efficiency.

Expanded health and unemployment insurance: (i) Health insurance. In 2012, social security covered
78 percent of health costs, with a supplemental health insurance being provided by employers to their
employees on a voluntary basis. To reduce inequality, complementary health insurance will be extended to 3.5
million additional workers by 2016 at the latest, and financed by an increase in employers’ and employees’
social contributions (equally split); (ii) Unemployment insurance. To improve job search incentives, employees
will be allowed to carry their accrued unemployment benefits’ rights to another job or from an unemployment
situation to a job (droits rechargeables).

Reduced labor market duality: Some 12 percent of private sector employees work under temporary
contracts, but, because of their revolving nature, these contracts account for 85 percent of hiring and have de
facto been used by enterprises to adjust the labor force in response to changing demand conditions. To

Box 2. Labor Market Reform on a Forward Momentum (Concluded)
internalize the social costs of overusing these contracts, employers’ unemployment contributions will be
increased by 4-7 percent for contracts shorter than 3 months. Permanent contracts will be encouraged by
waving the first three months of employers’ contributions to unemployment benefits for new hires under 26
years old.

Better targeted training: Under the current system, social security contributions finance part of training,
but the rights to training acquired in one job are not easily transferred to another job or even to
unemployment status. The result is that training is poorly targeted, and benefits those already in a permanent
job rather than on job seekers. To improve employability, workers will receive a personal “training account”
which they will be able to draw from at any point during their career.

Next steps. The fact that trade
unions and employers were able to
find a compromise is positive and
paves the way for broader reforms.
To remove existing distortions and
lift employment durably, significant
avenues for reform remain in the
areas of unemployment benefits,
geographical and professional
mobility, and further simplification of
individual dismissal procedures.

The minimum wage remains an obstacle to employment at the lower-skill end of the
labor force and for youth, despite substantial reductions in the tax wedge and employment
subsidies targeted to these group. Even after such targeted reductions, the cost of unskilled labor
compares unfavorably to that of other European countries. Budget constraints limit the potential for
reducing the tax wedge any further. The authorities expected substantial job creation from the
expansion of subsidy schemes (see Appendix IV). The mission suggested that a temporary freeze of
the minimum wage indexation could help bridge the productivity-labor cost wedge. The next index
jump will take place in January 2014.

Training and activation policies are also critical to improving labor market outcomes.
Spending on training comes to about 1.5 percent of GDP, but is broadly recognized to be poorly
targeted and ineffective. In addition to creating personal “training accounts” (Box 2), the
government has launched a broader reform process aimed at broadening the reach of training
programs to those most in need (e.g., the unemployed), and upgrading the quality of the training.
While the planned reforms of the pension and the unemployment insurance systems (paragraph 27)
are primarily intended to close financial deficits, they should also be seen as instruments to increase
employment rates. The 2010 pension reform and phasing out of various early-retirement schemes
have already increased the employment rate of older workers, but the gap relative to other
countries remains large, as it is for young workers. Thus, staff recommended that these reforms
focus on lengthening professional lives and increasing incentives to shorten unemployment spells,
rather than increasing contribution rates.

Regulatory and Product Market Reform
34.
Staff reemphasized the potential benefits of product market liberalization carried out
in conjunction with labor market reforms. It pointed to the productivity gains and employment
opportunities that could be created by removing regulatory and administrative obstacles to
competition in the services sector (regulated professions, transportation and distribution) and
redistributing the associated rents (through lower prices). Non-tradable sectors are characterized by
lower competitive pressures, weaker TFP growth and, relatedly, higher ULC increases.18 Because of
their high forward linkages to the rest of the economy, inefficiencies in the non-tradable sectors are
transmitted to the exposed sectors. Given the imbalance between the powerful vested interests of
protected sectors and the diffused benefits of liberalization, staff suggested that a stronger role be
given to the competition authority as an advocate of reform, by empowering it to review practices
and regulations and guiding the public debate through an enhanced consultative role. This would
enable a more ambitious implementation of the EU Services Directive.19
35.
The authorities saw the benefits of services liberalization as being too uncertain
relative to the adjustment costs. They emphasized the possible backlash against a broad
liberalization effort because of possible short-term adverse effects on employment, and indicated
that selected and opportunistic initiatives to increase competition would be more effective. They
noted that efforts to protect consumers against anti-competitive practices were being strengthened,
notably through the introduction of a class action provision in the new consumer law (the first such
provision in France).
36.
The authorities have announced a “simplification shock” to alleviate the regulatory
burden on enterprises. They recognized that the business environment needed to be stabilized
and improved. In addition to a commitment to tax stability for enterprises, the “simplification shock”
would lighten administrative procedures and shorten response delays (Appendix IV). Indeed, the
regulatory and tax systems appear to create important threshold effects in the enterprise sector. 20
For example, a firm becomes subject to more than 30 additional laws and regulations when it
exceeds 50 workers. One implication is the much smaller median size of French enterprises
compared with German enterprises, which also acts as an impediment to accessing export markets.
37.
Given the limited success of policies to promote housing construction and ownership,
the authorities have redirected efforts toward addressing supply rigidities. There is increasing
recognition that tax incentives and financing advantages that stimulate demand without addressing
constraints on the supply side have in fact contributed to raising prices, making housing less
18

A sector breakdown of TFP growth over the pre-crisis period shows that some market services (real estate,
professional services, wholesale and retail trade, and transport) were characterized by weak TFP gains, while sectors
exposed to deregulation (utilities and information and communication) registered rapid TFP growth.
19

The principles of “necessity, proportionality, and public interest” embedded in the Services Directive have given EU
member countries considerable latitude in how strictly to implement the Directive.

affordable to most, and benefiting property owners at the expense of taxpayers. Rising real estate
prices have been found to worsen inequality and undermine business competitiveness.21 Supply
constraints stem from zoning restrictions by local authorities and long and cumbersome procedures
on building permits.

The French financial system still needs to adapt fully to new international regulations
on bank liquidity and insurance solvency ratios. Bank credit has played a central role in the
financing of the economy. However, because household savings have been channeled (by tax
incentives) to life insurance and regulated savings products, banks have in turn relied heavily on
wholesale funding to meet demand for credit. Pressure to reduce exposure to wholesale funding is
thus creating a broader need to reorganize financial intermediation.
39.
Measures to foster more market-intermediated credit would support banks’
adaptation to new liquidity ratio requirements. Banks have started transitioning toward the
originate-and-transfer model of credit, although their ability to do so is constrained by narrow
interest margins which is compressing loan profitability. This reflects both intense competition and
cost rigidities on the funding side (discussed below). Margins on new loans have recently improved
and this should gradually improve profitability. The authorities also noted that measures were
underway to foster greater securitization of SME credit, with a first issuance planned for October
2013. Combined with a proposed rebalancing of tax incentives on life insurance policies toward
long-term riskier assets, these measures should help deepen market financing mechanisms,
especially for SMEs (Appendix IV).
40.
Continued progress towards new prudential norms would also be supported by
removing tax and regulatory incentives that undermine deposit collection by banks. Going
forward, domestic credit growth may be constrained if bank deposits cannot adequately compete
with products that benefit from tax advantages. The ceiling on regulated savings has been raised by
50 percent (to EUR 22,950 per person) since October 2012. Combined with an attractive yield, this
action has resulted in a surge in collection. Regulated savings account for 29 percent of customer
deposits and banks retain only 35 percent, on average, of these inflows. The remainder is centralized
at the Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations (CDC)22. Staff recommended more flexible sharing
arrangements with the CDC and a broader reform of financial savings taxation that levels the
playing-field between products of similar risk characteristics (e.g., maturity) in the medium-term.23

The CDC’s is a public institution mandated to finance social housing, but it has also been used to finance local
governments in the wake of the collapse of Dexia.

23

The 2013 Berger-Lefèbvre report’s recommendation to shift the tax incentives for life insurance policies toward
riskier long-term instruments decreases at the margin their substitutability with bank deposits, but at the cost of
creating yet another layer of complexity and fails to level the playing field.

The authorities agreed that tax incentives should favor long-term saving regardless of the
underlying instrument, but saw stability of financial savings taxation as important to maintain savers’
confidence. They indicated that measures based on the Berger-Lefèbvre report recommendations
will be implemented in the 2014 budget (Appendix IV), and that mechanisms to prevent the locking
of funds at CDC were being devised.

Effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism going forward could be
undermined by the rigidity of the rate on regulated saving products. The remuneration of taxfree savings passbooks was lowered in February 2013 to 1.75 percent but remains higher than
market rates. Banks considered that the regulated savings rate effectively acts as a floor on bank
deposit rates. Already, there is evidence that deposit rates for similar maturity products are higher in
France than in Germany whereas, historically, that was not the case. While the impact of higher
deposit rates on banks’ funding costs has been manageable in 2012, a continued widening of the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

35

FRANCE

spread between administered and market rates may eventually impair the monetary transmission
mechanism. The authorities agreed that such a risk could materialize in the event of future
reductions in ECB policy rates and that a tighter link between the rate on regulated saving products
and market or policy rates would be desirable, although they noted that, currently, any evidence of
fragmentation issues or funding cost rigidities was limited to deposit rates.
42.
Given the vulnerability of French global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) to
funding shocks and their potential for propagating the shock, actions to reduce perceived
risks assume critical importance.24 An essential next stage to the planned Single Supervisory
Mechanism (SSM) in 2014 is the asset quality review (AQR). Staff stressed the importance of
ensuring the highest credibility and transparency for such an exercise to be effective in restoring
confidence in the EA banking system. Given the risk of re-ignition of financial stress should the
exercise raise concerns about the burden sharing of possible capital shortfalls, staff emphasized the
importance of (1) pro-active communication on the framework and methodologies of the AQR and
(2) involvement of an independent third party. The authorities were confident that the reliance on
harmonized methodologies for NPLs, provisioning rules, and risk weights, and the involvement of
other national authorities (along with the ECB and EBA) would go a long way toward establishing
the credibility of the AQR. They were less convinced of the need to involve an independent third
party. The mission and the authorities agreed that, while loan loss provisioning ratios have stabilized
in the first quarter of 2013, corporate exposures are a key near-term risk in light of the fragile
recovery. By contrast, absent an unexpectedly large deterioration in unemployment, banks’ housing
exposures appear less risky and historical default rates have been low. Staff took note of the regular
assessments by the supervisor (Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel, or ACP) of the adequacy of risk
weights and internal risk-based models used by banks and generally conservative origination
practices for housing loans. They authorities considered that these actions placed them in a
relatively sound position ahead of the AQR. Since market participants are not fully aware of the
extent and frequency of ACP’s control measures, and because low risk ratios of French G-SIBs
relative to comparable jurisdictions have raised questions about the reliability of risk weights, staff
encouraged the authorities to publish the key findings of their regular evaluations and, more
generally, to enhance financial disclosures as recommended by the 2012 FSAP Update (Appendix
IV).
43.
The authorities restated their support for rapid progression on the three pillars of a
European banking union (supervision, resolution, and deposit insurance). They considered that
the next steps should focus on strengthening national regimes and harmonizing rules and
approaches (e.g., provisioning policies) at the European level. As regards supervisory arrangements,
the authorities believed that first-level supervision should be entrusted to joint national supervisory

24

As reported in the 2012 Spillover Report, the French, UK, and German banking system would be the most affected
by an adverse funding shock and, because of their large absolute amount of liabilities, are likely to amplify the initial
shock through interbank exposures.

teams rather than a single ECB-led team.25 Staff and the authorities agreed on the need for early
introduction of the SRM to ensure the effectiveness of the future SSM. In staff’s view, a strong Single
Resolution Authority (SRA) with the right incentives to act in a timely and least costly way, especially
on cross-border banks, is an essential basis for the SRM. In contrast to the EC’s proposal that the
Commission is best placed to be entrusted with the single decision-making authority, the French
and German authorities favored a “single resolution board” involving national resolution authorities,
with financing from the industry and national private backstop arrangements, allowing the SRA to
become operational swiftly without a Treaty change. Acknowledging that the debate on SRA had
shifted more recently toward issues of depositor preference and bail-in, the authorities noted their
preference for equal treatment of large depositors and other senior unsecured creditors, while
acknowledging that views were still evolving.26 Finally, they favored a gradual implementation of the
third and last pillar of the Banking Union, involving in a first stage a system of national deposit
guarantee schemes (DGSs) that follow harmonized rules and use own funds, with access by DGSs to
re-financing at the European level in a second stage.

As noted in the 2013 Euro Area Staff Report, outstanding legal uncertainties on the respective responsibilities of
the ECB and national competent authorities will have to be clarified to make the SSM operational.

26

Since the Article IV discussions took place, an agreement on procedures to handle failing banks was reached by EU
Finance Ministers on June 27, 2013. The agreement provides national regulators some flexibility to shield certain
types of creditors and liabilities using national backstops if hair cutting them out would put financial stability at risk
or spark contagion.

44.
The authorities have anticipated in their own banking reform the proposed EU
Recovery and Resolution Directive and possible follow-ups to the Liikanen report. The draft
banking reform law (hereafter, the law), expected to be voted in the summer of 2013, creates a new
resolution authority by reinforcing the powers of the supervisor (ACP) to prevent and manage
banking crises, under the new name of Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution (ACPR) (see
Appendices IV and V). It also requires banks to put in place recovery and resolution plans and gives
the ACPR the authority to mandate organizational changes in entities when the existing organization
could potentially complicate resolution. The law provides for the possibility of bail-in of
subordinated creditors. The structural provisions of the law aim at carving out only those activities
that do not significantly contribute to the financing of the economy, thus exempting market-making
activities which are considered critical to serving corporate clients. In response to the mission’s
concern about consistency of these reforms with future EU-wide provisions, the authorities indicated
that the national resolution framework—including the stance on bail-in rule and other provisions of
the law related to structural bank reforms—would be adjusted as needed to ensure compliance with
the evolving EU framework. Similarly, they expected the EU financial transactions tax (FTT) to replace
the French FTT introduced in August 2012. The mission argued that the far-reaching market
implications of the EU FTT (particularly for French banks which are major players in the derivatives
markets) warrant a reconsideration of its planned introduction next year. The authorities agreed with
the mission that the initial proposal would likely be amended leading to some delays in
introduction, but reiterated their support for an FTT.

STAFF APPRAISAL
45.
Recent improvements in economic indicators support the expectation of a gradual
turnaround in economic conditions in the second half of 2013, although downside risks
remain substantial. In a context of continued rapid fiscal adjustment, the recovery of domestic
demand depends critically on reducing the policy uncertainty that weighs on spending decisions of
households and enterprises. On the positive side, the relatively sound financial position of
households and enterprises implies that an improvement in confidence can translate relatively
quickly into a demand response.
46.
While fiscal consolidation needed to restore the health of public finances remains
considerable, there is scope to ease the pace of adjustment in 2014 while rebalancing it
toward stronger expenditure containment. A somewhat smoother adjustment in 2014 (than
envisioned by the authorities’ Stability Program) would support the fragile recovery. At the same
time, the adjustment effort may well need to be sustained for a longer period to reach structural
balance, than the authorities’ optimistic medium-term growth assumptions suggest. The transition
to structural deficit targeting is a welcome change in the fiscal policy framework and should provide
greater stability in policy planning. It should, however, be anchored by an explicit commitment to
contain expenditure growth as the key instrument of adjustment going forward combined with
greater clarity about the sources of these expenditure savings over the medium term. Such a
rebalancing would reduce policy uncertainty and thereby strengthen the recovery.

38

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FRANCE

47.
The government expenditure containment assumed in the authorities’ Stability
Program is appropriately ambitious and as such needs to be backed by structural fiscal
measures. The authorities’ approach to spending rationalization has produced some useful
recommendations, and more is expected from the upcoming reform of pensions and
unemployment insurance. However, the scale of the expenditure adjustment needed over the
medium term will require a more ambitious approach to rationalizing spending by local authorities
and deeper reforms to improve the efficiency of social spending.
48.
Structural policy priorities should go to strengthening the economy’s growth potential
beyond the pending recovery, and improving external competitiveness. As discussed in last
year’s report, significant rigidities have hindered the economy’s capacity to grow and to create jobs,
and weakened the external accounts as noted in the staff’s external assessment. The gap relative to
European trading partners in terms of cost and non-cost competitiveness remains a dampening
factor and ultimately a risk for macroeconomic balances, notably in a context where euro area
periphery countries are registering large competitiveness gains. On the positive side, France benefits
from a number of structural strengths which, in a more supportive environment, could provide a
substantial impulse to growth. They include a high household saving rate, first rate global
enterprises, positive demographics, a strong scientific research capacity, and high quality public
infrastructure.
49.
Since the last Article IV consultation in October 2012, the authorities have made
meaningful progress on the structural reform front. The reduction of the labor tax wedge gives a
boost to enterprises until the impact of structural reforms gains ground. The 2013 labor market
reform represents a significant change in both approach and content. The success of the
negotiations and its broad support could portend a more collaborative relation between social
partners going forward, which, as much as institutions, is key to producing efficient labor outcomes.
On the substance, the reform introduces important elements of flexisecurity, although much will
depend on implementation.
50.
While these reforms are welcome, they are not as yet sufficient to reverse the loss of
competitiveness. Deeper reforms are needed to close the gap between labor costs and productivity
and activate France’s structural strengths. The launching of reforms on several critical fronts
(pensions, worker training, administrative reforms and simplification, activation policies and
unemployment insurance) offers an opportunity to address a number of growth impediments.
Priority should go to increasing labor market participation, reducing regulatory hindrances and
opening product markets to greater competition. As demand recovers it will become increasingly
important to increase employment incentives, especially at the two ends of the age distribution.
Also, while it is important to allow the labor market reform to gain ground, there is scope to go
further in enhancing the flexibility of the labor market. Enhancing competition in product markets,
especially in the sheltered services sector, is an important lever of productivity growth and
employment creation. Notwithstanding potential adjustment costs, enhanced competition,
combined with the French social safety net, could be an effective instrument of economic
inclusiveness by redistributing rents and creating new business opportunities and thus jobs. Even

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

39

FRANCE

with productivity enhancing measures, the cost of labor remains a critical obstacle to employment at
the lower-skill end of the labor market, particularly for new entrants. To improve employment
outcomes, the rationing effect of the high minimum wage should be reduced and contractual work
arrangements could be eased for first-time entrants into the labor force.
51.
Financial sector priorities should go to solidifying the significant progress achieved in
terms of financial stability and ensuring that the efficiency of financial intermediation is
preserved as financial institutions adjust to new prudential requirements. Balance sheet
restructuring on the part of banks has greatly reduced financial stability concerns. Signs of
stabilization in loan loss provision ratios in the first quarter of 2013 are encouraging, although
continued vigilance is necessary to ensure adequate provisioning levels given uncertain recovery
prospects. Regular and strict assessments by the supervisor suggest that the French banking system
is comparatively well positioned ahead of the AQR. Reaching regulatory liquidity and funding ratios
remains a challenge for many French banks requiring continued improvement in funding structures,
higher deposit collection and a move toward more market-intermediated credit. It would be
important, in this regard, to ensure that tax incentives on financial products are better aligned with
bank regulatory objectives, for instance by limiting the capture of saving by government financial
institutions, phasing out regulated interest rates, and taking maturity-based rather than a productbased approach to tax incentives.
52.
Finally, it is important to underscore the positive role played by the authorities to
maintain the process of European convergence toward the Single Supervisory Mechanism and
Single Resolution Mechanism in the European Union on track. Apart from the efforts deployed
at the European level, the domestic banking reform now before Parliament contributes to the
process by aligning the resolution regime to the EU directives in line with FSAP recommendations.
53.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with France be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Appendix I. Main Recommendations of the 2012 Article IV
Consultation and Authorities’ Response
Fund Recommendations

Policy Actions

Fiscal Policy

“Many Directors stressed that adherence to the EU’s
fiscal target in 2013 would be crucial to preserve
credibility”. “Other Directors encouraged the
authorities to refrain from additional fiscal
tightening in the event of slower than-expected
growth in 2013.”

In light of the sharp deterioration of the macroeconomic outlook, the authorities
decided to maintain the pace of structural adjustment unchanged and let automatic
stabilizers operate fully. As a result, the 2013 fiscal deficit is projected at 3.9 percent of
GDP, compared to 3 percent in the budget.

Rebalance fiscal adjustment over the medium term
toward additional expenditure containment

The authorities are rebalancing the fiscal adjustment. According to the April 2013
Stability Plan, 70 percent of the adjustment in 2014 will come from expenditure
containment and 30 percent from revenue measures. After 2014, adjustment would
come solely from expenditure containment, and the tax-to-GDP ratio would remain
stable.

Financial Sector Policy

Further tax reform to create a level playing field and
remove disincentives against bank deposits.

The current reform proposal rebalances tax incentives provided to life insurance savings
toward equity investments over fixed income investments. A broader reform of financial
income is not on the table.

Structural Reforms

Address the competitiveness shortfall through deep
labor market reforms.

The broad labor market reform negotiated by social partners has been transposed into
law.

Open the services sector to more competition.

The entry of a fourth mobile telecommunication license in 2012 has led to increased
competition and lower prices
No other significant measure has been taken to increase competition in the services
sector.

Pursue wage moderation to support the reduction
in social security contributions.

Source: IMF Staff

48

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

The government continues the policy of wage moderation for civil servants introduced in
2010. In January 2013, the minimum wage was increased in line with the indexation
formula (0.3 percent), but no additional (discretionary) increase was granted.

EUR 20 billion (1 percent of GDP) allocated to reduce the labor tax wedge through a
corporate tax credit linked to the payroll (excluding wages above 2.5 times the minimum
wage). The tax credit is phased in over three years. The rebate amounts to a 3 percent cut in
labor costs. The tax credit will be financed in equal measure by revenue measures (VAT and a
new green tax) and expenditure measures

Implementation in course

Existing tax incentives, including rebates for research SME investments, will be kept over the
next 5 years

Commitment

The Public Investment Bank (BPI), created in 2012 by merging the three existing public
investment entities, will provide about EUR 42 billion in the form of public guarantees and
equity participations to SMEs in 2013. New government guarantees worth EUR 500 million
will be provided to ease financing schemes of SMEs

Implementation in course

The BPI will provide personalized help to 1,000 SMEs and intermediate-sized firms to access
and expand their presence in international markets; the revamped export bpifrance label (an
enhanced partnership between bpifrance, Coface and UBIFRANCE) will provide easier access
to export-financing products, and assist enterprises more effectively. A new "export
development loan" will be created; international corporate volunteers will be increased by
25 percent over the next three years to assist SMEs with market prospection; a "France
Brand" will be launched to promote French products

Commitment

EUR 35 billion program over ten years to promote innovation in enterprises; priority sectors
include renewable energy and health; the National Conference of Industry will be
restructured to better manage the "contrats de filières" (reciprocal commitments of industry
and the state to reinforce competitiveness within specific sectors)

"contrats de filières" have already
been signed for a number of
sectors, including, automobile,

administrative delays)
without parallel removal of other(s) of at least an equivalent size; and the reform of
commercial courts to improve the efficiency of the business justice
State commitment to pay faster

The state will target a payment deadline of 20 days to its suppliers. Up to 2 percent of public
procurement will go to SMEs and innovative intermediate-sized firms by 2020.

Imminent adoption

Commitment

Disseminating the use of digital technologies
Actions will be articulated around three axes: Making digital technologies a central part of
education and learning; promoting innovation and economies of agglomeration in digital
technologies through ”quartiers numériques” (digital neighborhoods); and promoting
inclusiveness (e.g. high-speed internet will be deployed throughout the country; public
employment services will use of digital technologies more effectively to improve the
matching between labor supply and demand)
Raising households' purchasing power and lowering costs for other sectors through structural reforms
Housing supply
Administrative regulations constraining the housing supply are simplified (loi sur le logement
et l'urbanisme, loi sur la mobilisation du foncier public en faveur du logement) and a grant of
EUR 1350 to low income households for insulation (plan d'investissemnt d'urgence pour le
logement)
New consumer law

Draft bill on railway reform

The "class action" provision under the new law will improve the contestability of rents earned
in protected sectors; enhance information provided to consumers; and raise awareness of
their rights
A draft bill will set a roadmap for bringing the management of the network and the provision
of maintenance services within a unified infrastructure manager. The role of the regulator will
be enhanced and public services will be updated. More competition should reduce costs for
enterprises and improve the quality of the services provided

More than 100 actions have
already been taken. The creation
of digital neighborhoods has been
initiated in Paris ("Paris Capitale

Description

Measures to Curb Unemployment
New contractual arrangements to promote youth's job inclusiveness
Emplois d'avenir
Emplois d'avenir are open-ended contracts or fixed-term arrangements longer than 3 years
addressed to low-skilled workers. The employer commits to a reinforced training program
and receives, in return, a subsidy of up to 75 percent of the minimum wage in the non-market
sector (35 percent in the market sector). The target is to create 150,000 jobs under this
scheme by end-2014.
Contrats de génération
Firms hiring young workers on open-ended contracts while preserving the jobs of their senior
employees benefit from a yearly lump-sum of EUR 4,000 (per worker hired) during the 3-year
term following recruitment. These contracts are meant to facilitate the intergenerational
transmission of knowledge. The target is to create 500,000 jobs under this scheme over the
next five years (of which 100,000 by end-2013).
Strenghtening incentives to exit unemployment
Reform of the unemployment insurance

Reform of professional training

Objective of the reform is to close the deficit of the unemployment insurance system
(0.13 percent of GDP in 2012). Choice of parametric reform (raising contributions vs.
tightening benefits and eligibility) will have an impact on labor market outcomes.

Implementation in course

Unemployment insurance is
managed by social partners who
have primary responsibility for its
reform. The government will
launch the process at the June
2013 social conference.
The reform falls in part under the
responsibility of social partners
because they contribute to the
funding of job training. The
government will launch the
process at the June 2013 social
conference, with a view to having a
reform before parliament by end2013.

FRANCE

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

The current system is ill-targeted, besides suffering from non-transparent financing. To
improve the effectiveness of training throughout life, the labor market reform passed into law
in May 2013 promotes portability of training rights through the creation of a personal
account. This will be followed by more comprehensive reform later this year to direct it to
those who need it most (jobseekers, less skilled workers, youth). The regions will have more
prominent role in the administration of training funds. Target of the reform is also to
generate fiscal savings of EUR 1.3 billion (0.06 percent of GDP). The adult training systems
costs 1.5 percent of GDP (including contributions by the state and social partners)

Public Spending
Modernisation de l'action publique

Audit by 2017 all public policies with a view to reduce their fiscal cost, to increase policies
efficiency, and to simplify them: 40 audits (covering 20 percent of General Government
spending) were launched in the first half of 2013 and 9 additional ones will be launched in the
second half of 2013. These audits include family allowances, professional training, and
subsidies to firms (see below).

Being implemented

Pension reform

● The pension reform aims at ensuring the financial sustainability, increasing the fairness of
the system, and simplifying it. The deficit should be reduced starting in 2014 with a view to
reaching financial balance at the latest in 2020. The means to achieve this objective will be
discussed with the social partners based on the analytical input by the Conseil d'orientation
des retraites (COR) and the reform proposals by the Commission pour l’avenir des retraites
(CAR).

Preparatory diagnostic by the COR
was completed in January 2013. A
report by the CAR was done in
June 2013. Discussions with the
social partners began in June, with
a view to have a draft reform
before parliament by end-2013.
Implemented as of April 1, 2014

● Social partners agreed to a 3-year under-indexation) of supplementary pensions (under the
mandatory system of retraites complémentaires) and an increase in contributions by
0.2 percentage points. Estimated fiscal gain: EUR 1 billion in 2014 (0.05 percent of GDP) of
which EUR 0.7 billion from the increase in contributions.
Health spending

Tightening of the spending growth ceiling (ONDAM) to 2.6 percent in 2014 and 2.5 percent
during 2015-17 (trend growth is estimated at above 4 percent). Estimated fiscal saving of EUR
3 billion in 2014 (0.14 percent of GDP).

Done

Family allowances

The law caps tax expenditure which benefits mostly families with children (quotient familial).
Estimated fiscal gain: EUR 1 billion in 2014 (0.05 percent of GDP). Total spending on family
allowances (tax expenditure plus outright transfers) was 2.8 percent of GDP in 2012.

Done

State subsidies to firms

Targeted reduction by EUR 2 billion by 2015 (0.1 percent of GDP out of a total subsidies of
1.8 percent of GDP, and 2.8 percent when tax expenditures are included)

Announced

Decentralization

Three laws will reinforce decentralization by transferring additional competencies from the
center to local governments (regional transport, student housing, promotion of local
languages) while clarifying responsibilities of each level of government so as to avoid
duplication. Introduction of larger metropolitan area authorities (beyond city boundaries) to
rationalize spending.

The first draft law is under
discussion in Parliament.
Parliament will discuss the second
draft law in the fall. The third law
will be discussed in 2014

their business model. By July 1, 2015 French banks will have to isolate their proprietary
trading activities in a subsidiary separately capitalized and self-funded. The trading entity will
be prohibited from: (i) ownership of, or unsecured lending to, hedge funds; (ii) high-frequency
trading; and (iii) involvement in agricultural commodity derivatives. Banks will continue to
provide a wide range of services to their clients under the universal banking model, including
hedging, financing, and investment. In contrast to the EU-wide proposals of the Liikanen
Committee, market-making activities will be permitted within the bank, on grounds that they
support market liquidity and hence benefit clients

The draft law is under discussion in
Parliament. The reform is expected
to be adopted by the summer of
2013. See:

Financial Sector Reforms
Draft Law on Banking Reform
Separation of Activities

Bank Resolution

Macroprudential Surveillance

● The draft law aligns the resolution regime to the draft EU Recovery and Resolution
Directive. The new regime requires recovery and resolution plans for large banks and
investment companies. It also gives the banking supervisor new responsibilities for banking
crisis preparedness and resolution, under the new name of Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et
de Résolution (ACPR)
● The draft law also allows the ACPR To involve the deposit guarantee fund in bank
resolution, under the new name of the Fonds de Garantie des Dépôts et de Résolution

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

● The draft law gives the authorities powers to separate failing entities into good and bad
banks and to establish bridge banks, in line with FSAP Update recommendations, and will
gradually increase the prefunding of the deposit guarantee fund from the current €2 billion to
€10 billion
The institutional framework for macroprudential surveillance will be strengthened. The draft
law broadens the powers of the current structure (Conseil de régulation financière et du
risque systémique) under a new name of Haut conseil de stabilité financière (HCSF). The
HCSF’s composition will remain unchanged (Minister of Finance, Governor of Banque de
France, Vice-President of ACP, Presidents of Autorité des Marchés Financiers and of Autorité
des Normes Comptables, as well as three independent board members). The HCSF will be able
to recommend measures to maintain financial stability, including a capital surcharge on banks
during periods of "financial bubbles" "; activation of the measures will be only possible
following a proposal by the Governor of the Banque de France, who will be solely entrusted
with this responsibility. The HCSF’s powers to implement macroprudential measures will be
legally binding, consistent with the provisions of the Capital Requirement Directive IV/Capital
Requirement Regulation.

Supervisory Powers

Description
Supervisory powers over governance of financial institutions will be strengthened, in line with
FSAP Update recommendations. ACPR will be able to oppose the nomination of managers of
credit institutions, investment firms, and insurance companies, if they do not meet fit-andproper requirements. ACPR will also be able to suspend managers during their mandate.
Other measures will also broaden the powers of the securities regulator

Raise financing available to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), social housing, and high-growth sectors
Higher ceilings on regulated savings products
The ceilings on the LDD and Livret A will be doubled to increase supply of financing for social
housing and SMEs (the former through CDC loans for the construction of social housing and
the latter through refinancing facilities at the BPI)

Reform of tax incentives for life insurance
policies

Status

● The Berger-Lefèbvre report (hereafter, Report) recommends making tax incentives for life
insurance policies that carry a capital guarantee (i.e., contrats en euros)conditional on a
minimum risk investment (e.g., in contrats en unités de compte, contrats euros-diversifiés, or
the new contrats Euro croissance) past a €500,000 amount. About 1 percent of the
households that own life insurance savings are expected to be affected by this measure

The ceiling on the LDD was
doubled from €6,000 to €12,000 in
October 2012. The ceiling on the
Livret A was raised by 50 percent in
two steps (October 2012 and
January 2013), to the current
amount of €22,950. No further
increases in the Livret A ceiling
have been announced
Measures based on the
recommendations of the report
are expected to be passed in the
2014 budget

● The Report also recommends extending fiscal incentives (with no ceiling) to a new contrat
Euro croissance (life insurance product with capital guaranteed only at maturity). By removing
the liquidity constraint resulting from the need to provide a capital guarantee throughout the
life of the policy, insurers are expected to be able to invest the proceeds in riskier, longduration, assets, including unlisted equity
Raise equity financing of high-growth sectors
and SMEs

The report recommends the creation of a Plan d'épargne en actions-PME (investment product
in equity of SMEs), modelled on the existing Plan d'épargne en actions (vehicle for
investments in listed stocks or stock mutual funds with income and capital gains exempt from
income tax if held for a minimum of 5 years), and which would be open to both retail and
institutional investors.

Access by SMEs to market-intermediated credit

A securitization company will be created to issue asset backed securities (ABS) backed by
bank loans to SMEs. Only loans currently eligible for re-financing at the Banque de France will
be accepted for securitization. The Banque de France will publish ratings for the ABS on the
basis of the ratings it already prepares for the SME universe concerned (and which are
currently used by banks as input in the origination process)

of financial information for the main banking groups as adequate. The
authorities will continue to report on financial sector developments in
the context of BdF, ACP, and Corefris annual reports, BdF annual

but have no plans to publish more comprehensive information and

additional responsibilities given to ACP by the draft banking law. The
removal of headcount limits is not expected in the near-term given
pressure not to expand budgets.

Partly Done. A draft law on banking reform currently before Parliament
will extend ACP powers to apply the fit-and-proper test to directors,
both upon their appointment and throughout their mandate, and will
grant ACP the ability to veto the nomination of or require the removal
of a Board member individually. The draft law will also give ACP the
ability to establish direct contact with the Board, and to summon and
jointly hear Board members.
Partly Done. The draft banking law will strengthen ACP’s capacity to
review major acquisitions by banks. No other legislative initiatives on
the matter are expected in the near term. The authorities indicated that
granting ACP formal approval powers for acquisition of EU financial
institutions would be inconsistent with EU law (Directive 2007/44/EC).

Appendix IV. Debt Sustainability Analysis 1
A.

Background

1.
Debt ratio. The combined
effect of low growth over several years
and the persistence of high fiscal
deficits (due to the impact of large
automatic stabilizers and of the fiscal
stimulus) have increased the debt-toGDP ratio by 26 percentage points in
five years to 90.2 percent in 2012. Part
of the increase (2.4 percent of GDP as
of end-2012) reflects financial support
to other Euro area countries.2 Such
support is projected to increase to
3.3 percent of GDP by 2014. The debt
ratio would continue to increase in the
short term peaking at 95 percent of
GDP in 2014-15 and decline thereafter.
2.
Sovereign yields. Currently,
yields on French debt are at historically
low levels. The benchmark yield (10
years) has declined from 4.7 percent in
July 2008 about 2.2 percent in midJuly 2013. The spreads over German
Bunds, which had increased to almost
200 basis points in November 2011,
were back to 57 basis points at midJuly 2013.

3.
Debt service. Owing to the sharp decline in interest rates, the rising debt has had a limited
impact on the debt service. Interest payments amounted to 2.6 percent of GDP in 2012, the same
level as in 2006.
4.
Contingent liabilities. Financial sector guarantees are estimated at 4 percent of GDP in
2013, of which about 1/3 is accounted for by Dexia.

rate. An interest rate shock could
be triggered by renewed tensions
in the euro area, more generalized
financial stress, including closure of

The scenario illustrates the impact
of a 200 basis points increase in

Combined shock. This
scenario combines the growth
shock with the interest rate shock
and the first expenditure shock
(one time increase of spending by

combination of multiple shocks

complete information on government assets and liabilities as well as disclosure of contingent
liabilities. Accounting standards have been changed to reflect accruals principles in a number of
areas, and these standards are clearly explained. The staff suggested that further steps could be
taken to identify and report quasi-fiscal activities in the budget presentation, provide a more
consolidated picture of fiscal activity outside the appropriation process, and improve the
reconciliation of stated policies with outcomes at the general government level.
These issues have been addressed in the Loi organique aux lois de finance (LOLF), which has become
fully effective on January 1, 2006. In addition to the annual appropriations, the first multi-annual
fiscal framework law was adopted in January 2009, and contains fiscal objectives for the
period 2009–12. The budget is organized along missions and provides details on the level of
appropriations for each mission and performance indicators by which the expected results of the
mission will be assessed ex post. The State Audit Office has been given the new assignment of
certifying the public accounts, and implementation of accruals basis accounting has been confirmed.
Parliamentary oversight powers have been strengthened.

Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies—Update

IMF Country Report
No. 02/248, 11/13/02

Summary: The 2000 ROSC noticed that transparency of financial policies is accorded a high priority
by all financial agencies assessed, and they are in observance of the good practices of the Code of
Good Practices on Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies. The major agencies disclose their
objectives, their legal and institutional frameworks, and have open processes of policymaking and
regulation. The principles of transparency are observed by dissemination of relevant information to
the public and in the agencies’ arrangements for internal conduct, integrity, and accountability.
However, the staff noted that the framework for supervision and regulation applicable to mutual
insurance firms is not as well defined and suggested to improve its transparency. The transparency
of monetary policy was not assessed by the Fund team as the Banque de France is a member of the
European System of Central Banks and no longer conducts independent monetary policy.

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FRANCE

Subsequently, the framework for supervision and regulation applicable to a specific group of mutual
insurance firms was modified in a number of steps. In August 2003, legislation created a single
supervisory body, the Commission de Contrôle des Assurances, Mutuelles et Institutions de
Prévoyance (CCAMIP) by merging the regular insurance supervisor (CCA) and mutualities’ supervisor
(CCMIP). Coordination with the banking sector supervisors was strengthened and the powers of the
supervisory authorities extended.

No. 05/398, 11/07/05

Summary: The report found that France is in observance of the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS). In particular, the mandate of INSEE and the Banque de France for the production
of the six macroeconomic datasets is clearly defined, with the reporting burden and the
confidentiality provisions given special consideration notably through the CNIS. Professionalism is
central to the statistical operations of the two institutions, internationally and/or European accepted
methodologies are generally followed, the degree of accuracy and reliability of the six datasets is
remarkable, statistics are relevant and provided on a timely basis, and they are accessible to the
public.
The report made a number of suggestions for further improvements: the responsibility of INSEE as
the producer of government finance statistics should be clarified; data sharing between the Banque
de France and the rest of the French statistical system improved; classification and valuation
methods in balance-of-payments statistics reviewed; consistency between the current account of the
balance of payments and the goods and services account in the national accounts improved; the
timing of revisions in the quarterly and annual national accounts aligned; and identification of data
production units of INSEE facilitated.
France continues to implement several of the 2003 ROSC Data Module recommendations, including
by promoting a broader understanding of statistical data revisions, making greater use of firm-level

France–Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA)

IMF Country Report
No. 12/341, 12/07/12

Summary: The 2004 report concluded that France’s financial sector is strong and well supervised.
No weaknesses that could cause systemic risks were identified. The strength of the system is
supported by the financial soundness indicators and the strong conformity to the supervisory and
regulatory standards approved by the Basel Committee, IAIS, IOSCO, FATF, and CPSS. The degree of
observance of the transparency code is high in all relevant areas. The French banking sector has
been modernized and restructured over the past two decades and is well capitalized. Systemic
vulnerabilities in the important insurance sector are well contained. Securities markets are large and
sophisticated.
The FSAP Update undertaken in January and June 2012 confirmed the resilience of France’s financial
system to severe market pressures but also identified challenges faced by the system. While its
structure has contributed to solid profit generation, the crisis exposed the risks posed by the banks’
size, complexity, and dependence on wholesale funding. The larger banks have been actively
restructuring their balance sheets—moving to more stable sources of funding; reducing their crossborder presence; and building up capital. They remain, however, vulnerable to sustained disruptions
in funding markets and reduced profitability, which would cause delays in meeting capital-raising
plans.

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FRANCE

The 2012 report confirmed that the regulatory and supervisory regime for banks, insurance, and
securities market was of a very high standard. Areas for improvement that emerged from the FSAP
Update included greater de jure independence of supervisory authorities; disclosure of the capital
treatment and related financial interactions within complex banking groups; a move toward a more
economic risk-focused approach to insurance regulation and supervision; and enhanced supervision
of investment service providers and financial advisors.
The 2012 report also found disclosure-related shortcomings. French banks and listed companies,
more generally, make extensive public financial disclosures under IFRS, and as a result of bank
regulations (Pillar III of Basel II). Nonetheless, disclosure of financial sector data falls short of
international best practice and enhancements would be highly desirable. Market discipline would
benefit from the publication of regular and comparable data on an institution-by-institution basis,
as well as detailed official analyses of financial sector developments in France.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
The economic database is comprehensive and of high quality, and data provision to the Fund is
adequate for surveillance. The authorities regularly publish a full range of economic and financial
data, and calendar dates of main statistical releases are also provided. France subscribes to the
Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard. The transmission of data in electronic form from INSEE
(Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques) and the profusion of data from various
institutions (Banque de France, INSEE, ministry of finance, ministry of labor and solidarity) have
helped to build an infrastructure, in which all data can be easily accessed through the Economic
Data Sharing System. A data ROSC mission conducted an assessment of the statistical system in
March 2003, and the report was published in October 2003. A factual update to the main report was
published in November 2004.
France’s monetary and banking statistics methodology conforms with the European Central Bank
framework, which provides comparable details as the Standardized Report Forms developed by STA.
Statistics for International Financial Statistics on banking institutions and monetary aggregates are
prepared on a monthly basis and are timely. Monetary data are also disseminated in the quarterly
IFS Supplement on monetary and financial statistics. France follows the European System of
Integrated Economic Accounts 1995 (ESA95). Data for GDP and its expenditure components are
available from 1978 onwards. Both annual and quarterly accounts provide reliable information,
although estimates from the two accounts differ slightly before the quarterly accounts are revised to
be aligned to the annual ones. In 2005, national accounts estimates were rebased to 2000 prices.
Government finance statistics have been strengthened recently. Both central and general
government data are presented in a more comprehensive fashion than previously and the data
for 2006 and 2007 also reflect the various impacts of recent budgetary reform. Although the source
data is collected by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, INSEE is principally responsible for the
compilation and dissemination of fiscal data in a framework that is consistent with ESA95. INSEE’s
website has recently been enhanced; in particular, it includes expenditure tables and government
revenues by subsector (central government, miscellaneous central government agencies, local
governments, and social security administration).
Balance-of-payments statistics should be interpreted with caution, given large errors and omissions.
Greater coherence between the external current account and the rest of the world account in the
national accounts is needed. In this regard, work with promising early results has been undertaken
on the transportation account.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with France
On July 29, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with France.1
Background
In a context of weakening economic conditions in Europe, sizeable fiscal consolidation, and
domestic policy uncertainty the economy flat lined in 2012, but recent improvements in
economic indicators support the expectation of a gradual recovery in the second half of 2013.
Credit conditions remain supportive, and private demand is unencumbered by balance sheet
repair issues and so is more apt to respond favorably to an improvement in confidence. In all,
the economy is projected to contract by 0.2 percent in 2013 and to grow by 0.8 percent in 2014.
The economy’s growth potential, beyond its cyclical recovery, is hindered by structural rigidities
in labor and product markets, which have, over time, contributed to a gradual loss of cost
competitiveness and export performance. These have been accompanied by sizeable declines
in the share of manufacturing production and employment and a narrowing of profit shares in
national income. Structural reforms to address these constraints have been given an important
forward momentum by the recent reduction in labor taxes and reform of the labor market reform
toward greater “flexicurity.”
The pace of fiscal consolidation was accelerated further in 2013, with a structural adjustment
equivalent to 1.8 percent of GDP, which comes on top of adjustment of 2.2 percent of GDP
sustained over the previous two years. IMF Staff projects that the fiscal deficit will decline to 3.9
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
percent of GDP in 2013, from 4.8 percent in 2012. The bulk of the adjustment to date (about 90
percent) has been realized through revenue measures, whereas IMF staff had suggested a
more balanced distribution of the effort. Under the new fiscal government framework, the
government has announced that it would henceforth be setting and monitoring fiscal objectives
in terms of the structural deficit, thus increasing the stability and reducing the procyclicality of
fiscal policy. The Stability Program of April 2013 targets an easing of the pace of adjustment
starting in 2014 and a rebalancing of the adjustment effort toward expenditure measures.
Financial stability risks have abated considerably, as banks have completed their deleveraging
objectives and strengthened capital and liquidity buffers. However, bank profitability remains
low. The French financial system still needs to adapt fully to new international regulations on
bank liquidity.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors were encouraged by recent improvements in economic indicators,
supporting the expectation of a gradual recovery during the second half of the year. Given
remaining risks, including from uncertain euro area prospects, Directors underscored the
importance of pursuing structural reforms to support the recovery of private demand and
strengthen competitiveness, while continuing efforts to ensure fiscal sustainability and
safeguard financial stability.
Directors welcomed the significant progress already achieved towards consolidating public
finances. Going forward, many Directors saw merit in allowing for a smoother pace of
adjustment than envisaged in the Stability Program to support the hesitant recovery. Many other
Directors advised the authorities to persevere with the consolidation plans under the program,
noting that it already allows automatic stabilizers to operate. While Directors welcomed the shift
to structural deficit targeting, a number of them noted that nominal targets should not be
neglected. With tax rates already at a very high level, Directors stressed that rebalancing fiscal
adjustment toward expenditure containment is critical, including in the areas of social security
and local spending where there is room for improved efficiency.
Directors welcomed the progress made on structural reforms. They noted that the reduction in
the labor tax wedge would boost enterprise competitiveness until the impact of deeper structural
reforms gains ground. They commended the broad labor market reform of 2013 and its
contribution to greater labor market flexibility while still protecting worker security, and
encouraged the authorities to follow up on its implementation.
Directors underscored the importance of pursuing reforms on a broader front to improve
competitiveness and growth prospects. They welcomed ongoing efforts to simplify the
regulatory framework and improve labor training mechanisms, and urged the authorities to
reform pensions in a way that increases labor market participation rather than contribution rates.
Directors called for deeper labor market reforms to increase employment of the young and lowskilled, and underscored the potential growth and employment gains from opening product and
services markets to greater competition.

3
Directors welcomed the significant progress achieved in reducing financial vulnerabilities while
preserving the capacity of banks to provide credit. Nonetheless, the combination of low bank
profitability and weak growth prospects calls for continued vigilance. Directors also noted that
the French financial system would need to adapt further to prudential requirements, notably in
regard to bank funding structures, which continue to rely heavily on wholesale funding. To that
end, Directors recommended that tax incentives on financial products be better aligned with
regulatory objectives, including by removing tax disincentives against deposits and phasing out
regulated interest rates.
Directors welcomed the efforts deployed by the authorities to keep the process of convergence
toward the Single Supervisory Mechanism and Single Resolution Mechanism in the European
Union on track. They commended the banking reform for aligning the resolution regime to the
EU directive, in line with FSAP recommendations, ring-fencing trading activities, and
strengthening the macro-prudential framework.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Mr. Hervé de Villeroché, Executive Director for France—
July 29, 2013
We would like to thank staff for a very interesting and well-written set of papers that offers a
balanced assessment both of the challenges that France is facing and of the policy actions
that have been taken to address them. Discussions with my authorities during the Article IV
mission have been thorough and fruitful, notably thanks to the open and frank approach taken
by the mission team.
Macroeconomic outlook
After two quarters of weaker than expected activity in late 2012 and early 2013, early signs
of returning growth are beginning to show for the second quarter of 2013. In this regard, my
authorities concur with staff analysis that growth should progressively pick up during the
second part of the calendar year, due to a gradual rebound of internal and external private
demand. . The size of the rebound in 2014 compared to 2013, as estimated by staff, is quite in
line with what my authorities expect.
Nevertheless, we forecast a higher level of growth than staff in 2013 as well as in 2014, even
if these forecasts will be reassessed for the 2014 budget law draft. This difference notably
comes from the fact that my authorities include the macroeconomic impact of the National
Pact for growth, competitiveness and employment that was adopted in November, and
notably the corporate tax credit that was introduced as part of this package, which will
amount to 20bn€ (1% of GDP) as of next year, based on payrolls (with an estimated
reduction in the cost of targeted labor force of more than 4%, yielding a total reduction of 3%
of overall labor costs). Its effects on competitiveness should help boost exports performance
and contribute to the rebound.
We also have a different view than staff regarding the potential negative impact of policy
uncertainty on growth. The determination of our authorities to keep on a fiscal adjustment
mostly driven by reducing expenditures and to implement structural reforms in order to boost
competitiveness is strong and clearly stated. Consulting stakeholders, notably social partners,
might entail a longer process, but it ensures full ownership. Indeed the experience with the
labor market agreement in January 2013 has shown how productive social dialogue can be.
In this regard, we do not think it is appropriate to say that policy uncertainty has increased,
especially based on a somewhat uncertain indicator.
Fiscal policy
My authorities’ stance on fiscal policy has been unchanged since the last Article IV
consultation, in line with our European commitments and also with recommendations of the
IMF: the main focus of our medium-term consolidation plan is still on structural adjustment,
so that debt will be put on a firm downward path, while at the same time letting the automatic
stabilizers fully play in case the outlook deteriorates, which happened in end 2012-early

2
2013. Consistent with that approach, the Council of the European Union has decided to
postpone the target of reaching a 3 percent of GDP nominal deficit of the general
Government by two years, to 2015. The consolidation path still entails a substantial structural
effort, continuing what has been achieved already in 2012 and 2013.
In terms of composition of the fiscal adjustment, France has also chosen a mix that is
consistent with the fiscal stance recommended by the IMF and aims at minimizing the
induced drag on growth (notably by targeting the efforts on better-off households and on big
enterprises),The bulk of the effort is progressively shifting from revenue raising to
rationalization of expenditures (the balance should thus shift from 70% of the effort in new
revenue and 30% in expenditures containment to 30% and 70% respectively). On this
question, we would like to stress two points:
–

First, as a methodological point, it should be noted that social entitlement schemes,
and more generally public policies, often take the form of tax rebates and exemptions
alongside direct cash transfers. Closing tax loopholes and rationalizing exemptions
should thus be considered as much an expenditures side reform as a revenue side
measure. This was typically the case in the recently announced reform of family
benefits, where the reform consists in a mix of reducing direct cash transfers and
implementing a lower ceiling for the reduction on income tax that benefit parents;

–

Second, a lot is underway to ensure more efficient public spending. Mechanisms do
already exist, that help with containing expenditures growth at levels even below their
natural trend. This is not only true for the central Government, where spending freeze
in real terms represents a notable effort, but also for social security administrations,
where for instance the progression of healthcare insurance spending has been firmly
kept in check, as noted by staff in the selected issues paper on expenditure savings.
Local governments’ deficit is constrained by a golden rule that prevents them from
financing current expenditures or debt rollover through new debt. All major public
policies are currently under review with the objective of improving their efficiency.
In particular, we agree with staff that the pension reform will be a key element of this
strategy. Following a first move by social partners on mandatory supplementary
pensions (3-year under-indexation as of next year), the Government should be in a
position to present a draft law to Parliament by the end of summer.

Last but not least as regards fiscal policy, we would like to underline that much attention has
been given to public finances governance these last years, putting France at the highest
standard in this matter with mechanisms that allow for flexibility while ensuring credible
enforcement of medium-term fiscal targets, in line with our European commitments. As part
of this new framework, the new independent fiscal council, the Haut conseil des finances
publiques (High Council for Public Finances), has begun its work and already issued a first
assessment of macroeconomic assumptions underlying the Government projections. More
public advices will follow in the fall as a contribution to the discussions on the 2014 budget.

3
Structural agenda
The main issue at the moment remains employment. As explained in the framework of the
previous Article IV discussion, the roll-out of the emplois d’avenir (subsidized jobs targeted
at low-skilled young people), and the contrat de génération (contracts that grant firms with a
subsidy when they hire young workers while keeping older ones, geared to boost
employment at the bottom and top of the age range) should help curb the increase in
unemployment. The staff report also rightly emphasizes the importance of the agreement
reached between social partners in January (Accord national interprofessionnel sur l’emploi
– ANI – interprofessional agreement on employment) and its transcription into the law
without changes. My authorities are confident that its implementation will give more
flexibility to enterprises to adapt to economic conditions and provide workers with a higher
degree of security. The fact that many decisions will now be taken at firm level, notably
temporary reductions of wages and working hours in case of a downturn, will provide
flexibility to adapt to short term economic developments while enhancing social dialogue at
enterprise level.
Two reforms are also planned, that should contribute to increase further the flexibility of the
job market and the labor force participation rate: social partner are discussing a reform of the
unemployment insurance scheme, which should enhance active unemployment measures,
and also the reform of the pension system, which should continue increasing the incentives to
work longer and thus senior workforce participation.
We do not entirely concur with staff’s appraisal on the minimum wage. Indeed reductions in
the tax wedge are sizable. They have proven effective to offset the negative effect on labor
demand of the minimum wage and to stabilize the share of unskilled labor in total
employment. It has to be noted that the automatic minimum wage increase should be
relatively low due to subdued inflation. My authorities are not convinced by the proposed
freeze of the minimum wage, at a time when indexation rules just changed in 2013.
Building on the social dialog method that has successfully been experimented for the ANI,
the Government has tasked social partners on the 8th of July to reach an agreement on an
overhaul of the system of professional training, where room for improvement is considerable,
as underlined by staff. Their proposals should be made in the fall, in time for the Government
to be able to propose a draft law on this basis before the end of 2013.
My authorities also intend to implement the comprehensive agenda that was launched last
fall with the National Pact for growth, competitiveness and employment. The French trade
balance has started to regain ground both in terms of price and non-price competitiveness
(the commercial deficit outside energy stands at 5bn€ at end-May (0.25% of GDP),
compared to 15bn€ at the same period in 2011 (0.75% of GDP)). The competitiveness
agenda is also epitomized by the long term investment plan of 12bn€ presented on July 9

4
(which will be funded mostly through the selling of public stakes in listed enterprises), but it
is larger than these specific action plans and permeate a number of other structural policies.
My authorities are also launching a series of measures aimed at simplifying the business
environment and enhancing the quality of public service, as noted by staff. The last Comité
interministériel pour la modernisation de l’Etat (Cabinet meeting on State administration
modernization) on July 17 has seen the Government approving a number of concrete
measures to give substance to the “simplification shock” announced by the President of the
Republic. Inter alia, it has been decided to reverse one of the overarching principles of
French administrative law, which required an explicit approval of the administration for
individual decisions in most fields. In the future, tacit approval will be the norm - in most
fields, absence of reaction in a two-month delay will be considered approval.
A law is currently debated in the Parliament on rationalizing competences between the
various levels of local administration by transferring some powers to the level deemed the
most efficient for each policy and by designating a clear leader in a number of policy fields.
It will notably give reinforced powers to the metropolitan level, with a view to create strong
institutions covering each of the major urban areas so as to overcome the institutional
weaknesses and the lack of coordination between fragmented city councils, without adding to
the layers of local government (see for instance specific measures for the future métropoles
of Paris, Lyon and Marseille).
As regards housing market developments, which in the past years have weighed not only on
household’s consumption but also on the overall competitiveness evolution, my authorities
concur with staff’s appraisal that prices are modestly overvalued, although we would
estimate the probability of a price correction in the short-term as “low-medium” rather than
“medium”. In a medium-term perspective, my authorities are committed to address
shortcomings on the supply side, both by making a portion of public landing property
available for construction and by preparing measures intended at simplifying the way new
construction is decided at local level.
As regards markets for goods and services, we concur with staff that a number of bottlenecks
should be lifted in the medium-run to boost productivity and employment. It should be noted
that France will participate during the next two years in a review exercise of the Services
directive, aimed notably at assessing transparency of regulated professions. In the
transportation sector, the reform currently underway aims at reuniting infrastructure and
maintenance activities into one entity so that management of the network infrastructure will
be more efficient. This prepares the railway sector to competition, which should be opened
around 2019, depending on new European directives currently under discussion. It should
also be noted that the draft law on decentralization mentioned above also contains measures
to liberalize interregional bus transportation services.

5
Financial sector
We concur with staff’s analysis on the good health of the French financial system, as
demonstrated also in last year’s FSAP. French banking groups have pursued the rebalancing
of their funding model, in line with the French supervisory authority (ACP, Autorité de
contrôle prudentiel) and the IMF recommendations, and have reinforced their capital base
with the objective of complying with Basel III’s new rules already in 2013.
We welcome the follow-up of the FSAP, which is useful to keep a fruitful ongoing dialog
with the authorities. Indeed, measures relating to powers of the ACP and to governance of
financial institutions (banking and insurance sectors) have been included in the banking law
that the Parliament definitely adopted a few days ago. This law represents a substantial
enhancement of the legislative framework in three main elements:
–

It introduces the cantonment of speculative business lines, with the financing of the
real economy as a key criterion;

–

It reinforces the crisis management framework by setting up a resolution authority
with the ACP at its core, now relabeled ACPR (Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de
resolution). It receives new powers to prevent and manage banking crisis (notably
regarding the internal organization of banking groups, in line with mandatory
individual recovery and resolution plans), under the direction of a resolution board
that comprises all stakeholders. This whole set up is in line with the framework of the
future European resolution directive, on which the ECOFIN Council reached an
agreement two weeks ago;

–

Regarding macroprudential supervision, it transforms the COREFRIS (Comité de
regulation financière et du risque systémique – Committee on Financial Regulation
and Systemic Risk) into a new body endowed with legally binding powers, the Haut
Conseil de Stabilité Financière (High Council for Financial Stability), which draws
heavily on the expertise of the Banque de France under the presidency of the Minister
for Finance.

We also welcome the assessment by staff that supervision by the ACP is of high quality,
based on a culture of intrusive and on-site supervision. We are notably pleased that the staff
takes note of the seriousness of ACP’s controls over the adequacy of risk weights and
internal risk-based models used by banks.
On the financing of the economy, we concur with staff that the overall robustness of the
banking sector has resulted in a more resilient credit flow to the real economy. We also
concur with the thrust of staff’s appraisal regarding the reforms needed to accompany the
structural transformation underway, towards a more disintermediated system, and to better
mobilize long-term savings for long-term financing projects. Recourse by corporates to
capital markets has substantially risen in the past years, and initiatives have been launched to

6
help securitize SME loans. Long-term savings mobilization is underway through a
multipronged approach:
–

The creation of the Banque Publique d’Investissement brings together a number
of public tools for investment both in equity and in debt, that were scattered and
will be better coordinated;

–

Rebalancing of tax incentives regarding different products of long-term savings is
underway and the recommendations of the Berger-Lefebvre report offer a good
basis in this regard. Changes in the life-insurance framework should also be
noted, which will enable insurance group to invest more in SMEs debt;

–

Lastly, the Government announced last week that 30bn€ of regulated savings
product (notably livret A) should be given back to commercial banks
(“decentralized”) to enhance their capacity to lend to SMEs, thus making it easier
for them to beef up their liquidity ratios and lessening the impact of this specific
system.

Déclaration de M. Hervé de Villeroché, Administrateur pour la France
29 juillet 2013
Je voudrais remercier les services du FMI de l’ensemble de documents très intéressants et
bien écrits qu’ils ont préparés et qui offrent une évaluation équilibrée à la fois des défis
auxquels la France est confrontée et des actions entreprises pour y répondre. Les entretiens
qui ont eu lieu avec les autorités françaises dans le cadre des consultations au titre de l’article
IV ont été exhaustifs et fructueux, grâce notamment à l’esprit d’ouverture et à la franchise
des membres de la mission.
Perspectives macroéconomiques
Après deux trimestres, fin 2012 et début 2013, durant lesquels l’activité a été plus faible que
prévu, les premiers signes d’un retour de la croissance commencent à apparaître pour le
deuxième trimestre de 2013. À cet égard, les autorités françaises partagent l’analyse des
services du FMI selon laquelle la croissance devrait s’accélérer progressivement pendant le
second semestre de l’année, grâce à un rebond graduel de la demande intérieure et extérieure.
L’ampleur de ce rebond en 2014 par rapport à 2013, tel qu’il ressort des estimations des
services du FMI, correspond tout à fait à ce que prévoient les autorités françaises.
Cependant, nous prévoyons pour 2013 et 2014 une croissance plus forte que les services du
FMI, même si ces prévisions seront revues pour le projet de loi de finances 2014. Cette
différence tient notamment au fait que les autorités françaises tiennent compte de l’effet
macroéconomique du Pacte national pour la croissance, la compétitivité et l’emploi qui a été
adopté en novembre, et notamment du crédit d’impôt pour les entreprises mis en place dans
ce cadre, basé sur la masse salariale, dont le montant atteindra 20 milliards d’euros (1 % du
PIB) l’année prochaine (avec une réduction estimative de plus de 4 % du coût de la
maind’oeuvre visée, ce qui entraînera une réduction totale de 3 % du coût global du travail).
Par ses effets sur la compétitivité, le Pacte devrait aider à stimuler les exportations et
contribuer au rebond de l’activité.
Notre avis diffère aussi de celui des services du FMI en ce qui concerne l’effet negative
potentiel sur la croissance de l’incertitude qui entourerait l’action des pouvoirs publics. Les
autorités françaises ont clairement exprimé leur ferme volonté de poursuivre un ajustement
budgétaire axé essentiellement sur la réduction des dépenses et de mettre en oeuvre des
réformes structurelles pour renforcer la compétitivité. La consultation des parties prenantes,
notamment des partenaires sociaux, est certes susceptible d’allonger le processus, mais elle
garantit l’adhésion de tous à l’action engagée. À cet égard, l’expérience de l’accord de
janvier 2013 sur la réforme du marché du travail a montré à quel point le dialogue social
pouvait être productif. Il nous semble donc inexact de dire que l’incertitude entourant l’action
des pouvoirs publics s’est accentuée, surtout en se fondant sur un indicateur à la fiabilité
incertaine.
Politique budgétaire

2
L’orientation de la politique budgétaire n’a pas varié depuis les dernières consultations au
titre de l’article IV, conformément à nos engagements européens et aussi aux
ecommandations du FMI : le pilier central de notre plan de rééquilibrage à moyen terme reste
l’ajustement structurel, afin de remettre fermement la dette sur une trajectoir e descendante
tout en laissant jouer pleinement les stabilisateurs automatiques en cas de dégradation des
perspectives, comme cela s’est produit fin 2012–début 2013. En coherence avec cette
approche, le Conseil de l’Union européenne a décidé de différer de deux ans, jusqu’à 2015,
l’objectif de réduction du déficit nominal des administrations publiques à 3 % du PIB. La
poursuite du rééquilibrage suppose encore un effort considérable sur le plan structurel, dans
le prolongement de ce qui a déjà été réalisé en 2012 et 2013.
En ce qui concerne la composition de l’ajustement budgétaire, la France a aussi choisi un
ensemble de mesures qui correspond à l’orientation budgétaire recommandée par le FMI et
vise à limiter autant que possible les effets négatifs sur la croissance (notamment en ciblant
les efforts sur les ménages les plus aisés et sur les grandes entreprises). Le plus gros de
l’effort est progressivement transféré de la mobilisation de recettes vers la rationalisation des
dépenses (la proportion devrait ainsi passer de 70 % de l’effort pour l’augmentation des
recettes et 30 % pour la limitation des dépenses à 30 % et 70 % respectivement). À ce sujet,
je voudrais souligner deux points:
–

Premièrement, du point de vue méthodologique, il convient de noter que les
dispositifs de prestations sociales, et plus généralement les politiques publiques,
prennent souvent la forme d’exonérations et de dégrèvements fiscaux, aux côtés des
transferts monétaires directs. La suppression des niches fiscales et la simplification
des exonérations devraient donc être considérées autant comme desmesures touchant
aux dépenses que comme des mesures touchant aux recettes. Tel a été le cas, en
particulier, avec la réforme des allocations familiales annoncée récemment, qui
prévoit à la fois une réduction des transferts monétaires directs et l’abaissement du
plafond applicable pour la réduction de l’impôt sur le revenue dont bénéficient les
parents;
– Deuxièmement, un grand nombre de mesures sont en cours pour assurer une plus
grande efficacité des dépenses publiques. Existe déjà des mécanismes qui aident à
limiter l’accroissement des dépenses en le maintenant à un niveau qui est meme en
deçà de sa tendance naturelle. Il en est ainsi non seulement pour l’administration
centrale, où le gel des dépenses en termes réels représente un effort notable, mais
aussi pour les administrations de sécurité sociale, où, par exemple, la progression des
dépenses d’assurance-santé est fermement maîtrisée, comme le relèvent les services
du FMI dans leur document sur les economies réalisables du côté des dépenses. Le
déficit des collectivités locales est soumis à une règle d’or qui empêche celles-ci de
financer leurs dépenses courantes ou le refinancement de leurs dettes par de nouveaux
emprunts. Les grandes politiques publiques font actuellement l’objet d’un réexamen
dont l’objectif est d’en améliorer l’efficacité. En particulier, nous partageons l’avis
des services du FMI qui estiment que la réforme des retraites sera un élément clé de

3
cette stratégie. Après une première avancée des partenaires sociaux concernant les
retraites complémentaires obligatoires (sous-indexation pendant trois ans à compter
de l’année prochaine), le gouvernement devrait être en mesure de présenter un projet
de loi au Parlement d’ici à la fin de l’été.
Dernière considération, mais non des moindres, concernant la politique budgétaire, nous
voudrions souligner que, ces dernières années, une grande attention a été accordée à la
gouvernance des finances publiques. La France observe ainsi les norms les plus strictes en la
matière, au moyen de mécanismes qui permettent une certain souplesse tout en assurant de
façon crédible le respect des objectifs budgétaires à moyen terme, conformément à nos
engagements européens. Dans ce nouveau cadre, le Haut Conseil des finances publiques,
instance indépendante nouvellement créée, a commencé ses travaux et a déjà publié une
première évaluation des hypotheses macroéconomiques qui sous-tendent les projections du
gouvernement. De nouveaux avis publics suivront à l’automne pour alimenter le débat sur le
budget 2014.
Programme structurel
Actuellement, le chômage reste la principale préoccupation. Comme cela a été expliqué lors
des précédents entretiens au titre de l’article IV, le lancement des emplois d’avenir (employs
subventionnés destinés aux jeunes peu qualifiés) et des contrats de génération (contrats qui
accordent une subvention aux entreprises lorsqu’elles recrutent de jeunes travailleurs en
gardant ceux qui sont plus âgés, et dont l’objectif est de stimuler l’emploi dans les tranches
d’âge inférieure et supérieure) devrait contribuer à ralentir la progression du chômage. Le
rapport des services du FMI insiste à juste titre sur l’importance de l’Accord national
interprofessionnel sur l’emploi (ANI), accord conclu entre les partenaires sociaux en janvier,
et de sa transposition dans la loi sans modifications. Les autorités que je représente sont
convaincues que la mise en oeuvre de cet accord donnera une plus grande souplesse aux
entreprises pour s’adapter aux conditions économiques et offrir aux travailleurs davantage de
sécurité. Nombre de décisions seront désormais prises au niveau des entreprises, notamment
pour ce qui est des réductions temporaires des salaires et des heures de travail en cas de
ralentissement de l’activité, ce qui leur permettra de mieux s’adapter à l’évolution
économique à court terme tout en renforçant le dialogue social au niveau de l’entreprise.
Deux réformes sont aussi prévues qui devraient contribuer à assouplir encore le marché du
travail et à accroître le taux d’activité : les partenaires sociaux débattent actuellement d’une
réforme du système d’assurance-chômage, qui devrait renforcer les mesures actives contre le
chômage, mais aussi de la réforme du système de retraite, qui devrait continuer à accroître les
incitations à travailler plus longtemps et donc la participation des seniors au marché du
travail.
Nous ne sommes pas tout à fait d’accord avec l’évaluation des services du FMI concernant le
salaire minimum. En effet, les réductions du «coin» fiscal sont importantes. Elles se sont

4
révélées efficaces pour compenser l’effet négatif du salaire minimum sur la demande de
travail et pour stabiliser la proportion de main-d’oeuvre non qualifiée dans l’emploi total. Il
convient de noter que l’augmentation automatique du salaire minimum devrait être
relativement faible compte tenu du niveau modéré de l’inflation. Les autorités françaises ne
sont pas convaincues par la proposition de gel du salaire minimum, alors que les règles
d’indexation viennent d’être modifiées en 2013.
En s’appuyant sur la méthode de dialogue social appliquée avec succès pour l’ANI, le
gouvernement a demandé le 8 juillet aux partenaires sociaux de se mettre d’accord sur une
refonte du système de formation professionnelle, domaine où les possibilités d’amélioration
sont considérables, comme l’ont souligné les services du FMI. Ils devraient présenter leurs
suggestions à l’automne pour permettre au gouvernement de proposer un projet de loi avant
la fin de 2013.
Les autorités françaises entendent aussi mettre en oeuvre le vaste programme lancé à
l’automne dernier dans le cadre du Pacte national pour la croissance, la compétitivité et
l’emploi. La balance commerciale française a commencé à se redresser à la fois en termes de
compétitivité par les prix et hors prix (le déficit commercial hors énergie s’établissait fin mai
à 5 milliards d’euros (0,25 % du PIB), contre 15 milliards d’euros pour la même période de
2011 (0,75 % du PIB)). Le programme pour la compétitivité est aussi illustré par le plan
d’investissement à long terme d’un montant de 12 milliards d’euros présenté le 9 juillet (qui
sera financé principalement par la vente de participations de l’État dans des enterprises
cotées), mais il va au-delà de ces plans d’action spécifiques et fait aussi intervenir plusieurs
autres politiques structurelles.
Les autorités françaises ont également engagé une série de mesures destinées à simplifier
l’environnement administratif dans lequel les entreprises exercent leurs activités et à
accroître la qualité du service public, comme l’ont noté les services du FMI. Le dernier
Comité interministériel pour la modernisation de l’État, qui s’est réuni le 17 juillet, a vu
legouvernement approuver plusieurs mesures concrètes pour donner corps au «choc de
simplification» annoncé par le Président de la République. Entre autres, il a été décidé de
revenir sur l’un des principes fondamentaux du droit administratif français, en vertu duquel
l’approbation explicite de l’administration est requise pour chaque décision dans la plupart
des domaines. À l’avenir, l’approbation tacite sera la norme — dans la plupart des domaines,
l’absence de réaction dans un délai de deux mois vaudra approbation.
Une loi est actuellement débattue au Parlement sur la rationalisation des compétences entre
les différents niveaux de l’administration locale : certains pouvoirs seront transférés au
niveau considéré le plus efficace pour chaque politique et un dirigeant sera clairement
désigné pour un certain nombre de domaines de l’action publique. La loi conférera
notamment des pouvoirs renforcés au niveau métropolitain, l’objectif étant de créer des
institutions solides couvrant chacune des grandes zones urbaines de manière à remédier aux
carences institutionnelles et à l’absence de coordination entre des municipalités fragmentées,

5
sans pour autant ajouter de nouvelles strates administratives au niveau local (voir par
exemple, les mesures spécifiques concernant les futures métropoles de Paris, Lyon et
Marseille).
En ce qui concerne l’évolution du marché immobilier, qui ces dernières années a pesé non
seulement sur la consommation des ménages mais aussi sur l’évolution globale de la
compétitivité, les autorités françaises souscrivent à l’évaluation des services du FMI, selon
laquelle les prix sont légèrement surévalués, même si nous estimons qu’à court terme la
probabilité d’une correction des prix est «faible à moyenne» plutôt que «moyenne». Dans
une perspective de moyen terme, les autorités françaises sont déterminées à corriger
l’insuffisance de l’offre, à la fois en ouvrant à la construction une partie des terrains de l’État
et en préparant des mesures pour simplifier la manière dont les décisions en matière de
construction sont prises au niveau local.
Pour ce qui est des marchés de biens et de services, nous estimons, comme les services du
FMI, qu’un certain nombre de goulets d’étranglement devraient être supprimés à moyen
terme pour stimuler la productivité et l’emploi. Il convient de noter que la France participera
au cours des deux années à venir à un exercice de revue de la directive Services, visant
notamment à évaluer la transparence des professions réglementées.
Dans le secteur des transports, la réforme en cours a pour but de réunir les activités
d’infrastructure et de maintenance en une seule entité afin d’assurer une gestion plus
efficiente de l’infrastructure du réseau. Il s’agit de préparer le secteur ferroviaire à la
concurrence, qui devrait être ouverte aux environs de 2019, en fonction du résultat des
négociations en cours sur les nouvelles directives européennes. Il convient enfin de noter que
le projet de loi de décentralisation mentionné plus haut comporte aussi des mesures visant à
libéraliser les services de transport interrégionaux par car.
Secteur financier
Nous partageons l’analyse des services du FMI sur la bonne santé du système financier
français, attestée également par le PESF de l’année dernière. Les groupes bancaires français
ont continué à rééquilibrer leur mode de financement, conformément aux recommandations
de l’Autorité de contrôle prudentiel (ACP) et du FMI, et ont renforcé leurs capitaux propres
pour se conformer aux nouvelles règles de Bâle III dès 2013.
Nous nous félicitons du suivi du PESF, démarche utile pour assurer la poursuite d’un
dialogue fructueux avec les autorités. De fait, les mesures relatives aux compétences de
l’ACP et à la gouvernance des institutions financières (secteurs de la banque et de
l’assurance) ont été intégrées à la loi bancaire, que le Parlement a adoptée définitivement il y
a quelques jours. Cette loi représente une amélioration substantielle du cadre législatif dans
trois domaines clés :

6
–

elle instaure le cantonnement des activités spéculatives, avec le financement de
l’économie réelle comme critère essentiel;

–

elle renforce le cadre de gestion des crises en créant une autorité de resolution dont
l’ACP, désormais dénommée ACPR (Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de
résolution), est la pièce maîtresse. Celle-ci est investie de nouveaux pouvoirs pour
prévenir et gérer des crises bancaires (en particulier en ce qui concerne l’organisation
interne des groupes bancaires, en phase avec les plans obligatoires de redressement et
de résolution), sous la direction d’un conseil de resolution regroupant toutes les
parties prenantes. L’ensemble de ce dispositif est conforme au cadre de la future
directive européenne relative à la résolution des banques, sur laquelle le Conseil
ÉCOFIN est parvenu à un accord il y a deux semaines;

–

en ce qui concerne la supervision macroprudentielle, elle transforme le Comité de
régulation financière et du risque systémique (COREFRIS) en un nouvel organisme
doté de pouvoirs juridiquement contraignants, le Haut conseil de stabilité financière,
qui met largement à contribution l’expertise de la Banque de France sous la
présidence du Ministre des finances.

Nous nous réjouissons également de l’opinion des services du FMI selon laquelle la
supervision exercée par l’ACP est de grande qualité et fondée sur une culture de supervision
intrusive et sur place. En particulier, nous sommes heureux de constater que les services du
FMI prennent acte du sérieux dont l’ACP fait preuve en contrôlant la validité des
pondérations des risques ainsi que celle des modèles internes basés sur le risque utilisés par
les banques.
Pour ce qui est du financement de l’économie, nous partageons l’avis des services du FMI
qui estiment que la solidité globale du secteur bancaire a conduit à une plus grande resilience
des flux de crédit vers l’économie réelle. Nous partageons aussi pour l’essentiel l’évaluation
des réformes nécessaires pour accompagner la transformation structurelle en cours vers un
système axé davantage sur la désintermédiation et pour mieux mobiliser l’épargne à long
terme au profit des projets de financement à long terme. Le recours des entreprises aux
marchés financiers s’est fortement accru ces dernières années, et des initiatives ont été
lancées pour promouvoir la titrisation des prêts aux PME. La mobilisation de l’épargne à
long terme est en cours à travers une approche à plusieurs volets :
–

la création de la Banque publique d’investissement, qui regroupe plusieurs outils
publics permettant d’effectuer des investissements sous forme de prises de
participation et de prêts, outils qui étaient dispersés et qui seront désormais mieux
coordonnés;

–

le rééquilibrage des incitations fiscales relatives à divers produits d’épargne à long
terme est en cours et les recommandations du rapport Berger-Lefebvre constituent
une bonne base à cet égard. Il convient également de noter les modifications

7
apportées au cadre de l’assurance-vie, qui permettront aux groups d’assurance
d’investir davantage dans le crédit aux PME;
–

enfin, le gouvernement a annoncé la semaine dernière que 30 milliards d’euros de
produits d’épargne réglementés (notamment le livret A) seraient reversés aux banques
commerciales («décentralisés») pour accroître leur capacité de prêt aux PME, ce qui
les aidera à renforcer leurs ratios de liquidité et atténuera l’impact de ce système
spécifique.
