IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Myanmar
On January 25, 2017, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Myanmar.
Myanmar’s economy grew broadly as expected in FY 2015/16 (ending March 31), at a healthy
pace of 7.3 percent, despite massive floods during July–September 2015. Activity softened
during the first half of FY 2016/17, but is expected to recover in the second half on account of
the resumption of construction in Yangon after a temporary halt for regulatory compliance
purposes. The growth of agricultural production was softer than expected. The external
environment has been weak due to slowing demand from major trading partners and significant
natural gas and other commodity price declines in 2015 and 2016. Macroeconomic imbalances
persist, with continuing inflation pressure, an increased fiscal deficit, and a widening external
current account deficit.
Taking into account sluggish activity in the first half of the year, growth for FY 2016/17 is
projected at slower rate of 6.3 percent. Inflation is projected to be around 7 percent on average
for FY 2016/17, and the external current account deficit to increase to about 6.5 percent of GDP.
Risks to the growth outlook are tilted toward downside and relate to: (i) concerns over policy
clarity; (ii) financial sector vulnerability on the back of rapid credit growth in recent years; (iii)
weak commodity prices and slow export demand; (iv) global financial market volatility; and (v)
natural disasters.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every
year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's
economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for
discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Myanmar’s continuing progress on economic and political
transition, and noted the robust growth performance in 2015/16. As Myanmar continues with its
transition, Directors saw good opportunities to expand inclusive growth, which will require a
strengthening of macroeconomic and financial stability and a deepening of structural reforms, as
well as effective communication of economic policies and development plans to support
confidence.
Directors highlighted the critical role of exchange rate flexibility in strengthening Myanmar’s
external position and protecting foreign exchange reserves. They observed that the official
reference exchange rate should reflect market conditions consistent with the managed float
exchange rate regime, and welcomed the authorities’ interest in exploring options for a
transparent mechanism for setting the reference rate. Directors stressed that continued structural
reform to improve the business environment is critical to strengthening Myanmar’s external
position over the longer run.
Directors agreed that monetary conditions should be tightened to contain inflation and reduce
pressure on the exchange rate. In this regard, they welcomed the authorities’ commitment to
phasing out financing by the Central Bank of Myanmar. A number of Directors encouraged a
faster phase out of central bank financing, but a few others suggested caution in view of its
potential impact on financing costs and credit flow to the private sector, given the
underdeveloped bond market. In light of past monetary expansion and continued strong credit
growth, Directors also supported a more active liquidity management in line with reserve money
targets that are consistent with the medium term inflation objective.
While recognizing Myanmar’s significant development needs, Directors emphasized the
importance of fiscal restraint and improved spending efficiency to maintain debt sustainability.
Directors welcomed improvements in tax administration, and encouraged continued efforts to
increase fiscal revenues, including by swiftly moving to the next phase of revenue reform and
streamlining tax exemptions and incentives. They also recommended prioritizing key
infrastructure and social expenditure, and welcomed preparations for revised Financial Rules and
Regulations and a public financial management law. Directors also underscored the importance
of containing fiscal risks from state enterprises and public private partnerships.
Directors commended progress on financial sector reform, and called for further steps to reduce
financial system risks. They urged the expeditious completion of full scope examinations of all
banks, as well as the timely issuance of regulations to implement the Financial Institutions Law.
Directors encouraged the authorities to accelerate the reform of systemically important state
owned banks and to further increase financial sector supervision capacity. In order to improve
access to credit for the agricultural sector and SMEs, Directors saw scope for a carefully

sequenced loosening of controls on lending interest rates, supported by appropriate supervision.
Directors also emphasized that ongoing work on anti-money laundering/combating the financing
of terrorism (AML/CFT) should remain a priority.
Directors welcomed the progress in capacity development in Myanmar and encouraged the
authorities’ further use of Fund technical assistance and training. They emphasized the
importance of improved macroeconomic statistics for surveillance and macroeconomic
management.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
December 29, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context: Myanmar’s historic general elections in late 2015 resulted in a wave of
optimism. Foreign investor interest is strong and development partners are scaling up
their engagement. The new government was formed in April and is articulating its
economic plans as an integral part of political and economic transition.
Economic situation and outlook: Activity slowed during the first half of FY 2016/17 but
is expected to recover during the second half. The slowdown, largely due to transitionrelated weakness in construction activity and a sluggish agricultural recovery from the
impact of Cyclone Komen in 2015, has occurred amid continued inflation pressure, a
weaker external position and emerging financial sector risks. Risks to the growth outlook
are tilted toward downside.
Medium term prospects: With continued structural reform and strengthening foreign
direct investment, economic prospects remain favorable. Maintaining macrofinancial
stability and deepening structural reforms will be critical for sustaining growth.
Policy recommendations:






Monetary policy should be tightened to contain inflation, by phasing out central
bank financing of the fiscal deficit and more proactive liquidity management.
The government should keep the fiscal deficit in check and build fiscal space by
continuing to advance domestic revenue mobilization, expenditure prioritization,
and spending efficiency.
Greater exchange rate flexibility is needed to strengthen Myanmar’s external
position and maintain competitiveness.
The authorities should accelerate financial sector reform to protect financial stability
and enable greater financial inclusion, thereby supporting inclusive growth.

CONTEXT
1.
The National League for Democracy led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi formed a new
government in April 2016 after historic elections in November 2015. Following decades of
isolation, prospects and expectations for the economy are high in both the private and public
sectors. Development partners have been scaling up their engagement and support for Myanmar,
and in October the United States lifted all remaining sanctions on trade, investment and financial
flows.
2.
The new government faces formidable challenges, and has prioritized the peace
process amid ongoing ethnic conflict. First steps towards peace commenced with the 21st Century
Panglong Peace conference in late August, which sought to bring into the peace process the armed
ethnic groups currently outside of the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement. Peace and national
reconciliation will remain a priority for the new government as it continues with the effort to build a
stable political foundation for socioeconomic development. Regional growth has been uneven, and
GDP per capita and living standards differ significantly across regions and states. Progress on the
peace process would improve the reach of infrastructure and social services and enhance the
inclusiveness of growth.
3.
The new government has launched a high-level economic vision and is in the process
of articulating detailed action plans. With the economy hitting a soft patch in the first half of
FY 2016/17, the authorities have strengthened consultation with the business community to address
concerns over policy uncertainty, including by expediting passage of the Investment Law.
Nevertheless, the government continues to face challenges, including capacity constraints, in
formulating detailed economic policies and supporting regulations, which are urgently needed to
provide clarity on the business environment.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
4.
Although growth fundamentals remain strong, activity slowed in the first half of
FY 2016/17. The economy grew broadly as expected in FY 2015/16, at a healthy pace of 7.3 percent,
despite massive floods after Cyclone Komen in July 2015 and a weak external environment. Taking
into account sluggish activity in the first half of the year, staff projects a slower growth rate of
6.3 percent for FY 2016/17—a downward revision of around 2 percentage points from last year’s
projection (which was made amid signs of economic overheating). The slowdown was largely
associated with a temporary halt in construction projects in Yangon—which accounts for more than
20 percent of the country’s economic activity—for regulatory compliance purposes. The growth of
agricultural production was also softer than expected, disappointing predictions of a rebound from
last year’s floods, while the suspension of investment approvals by the Myanmar Investment
Commission (MIC) earlier in the year contributed to the slowdown. At the same time, the external
environment has been weak due to slowing demand from major trading partners and significant
natural gas and other commodity price declines in 2015–16.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5.
Inflation and credit growth remain strong, notwithstanding some recent moderation.1
Inflation has been underpinned by money supply growth resulting from CBM purchases of
government securities (Box 1), with flood effects on food prices adding further pressure. Inflation
peaked at 14 percent in November 2015, before base effects caused a significant decline to
3.6 percent (y/y) in October 2016. However, inflation averaged 8 percent for the year to October,
and excluding base effects underlying inflation remained at around 7 percent in October (Text
Chart). Meanwhile, credit growth continued at 34 percent (y/y) in March, far outpacing nominal GDP
growth. Preliminary data suggest that bank credit remains concentrated in the trade and
construction sectors, and that credit expansion in the latter has slowed (Text Chart). While the strong
credit growth partly reflects deepening from a very low base, it also raises potential credit risks.

6.
The fiscal deficit widened sharply in FY 2015/16, reaching 4.1 percent of GDP from
0.9 percent in FY 2014/15. The increase in the deficit resulted mainly from a decline in revenues
from underperforming state economic enterprises (SEEs), on the back of lower energy prices and
inefficiencies, as well as a rise in public sector wages (Table 2). Nevertheless, the deficit outturn was
below the original budget estimate of 4.9 percent of GDP, as a result of over-performance in tax
collection, under-execution of capital expenditure, and commendable efforts by the government to
rationalize current expenditure. In net terms the deficit was entirely financed by the Central Bank of
Myanmar (CBM) through automatic purchases of treasury bills.
7.
The external position has weakened due to a widening trade deficit and lower-thanexpected FDI flows. The current account deficit widened from 3.3 percent of GDP in FY 2014/15 to
5.2 percent of GDP in FY 2015/16, mainly driven by falling revenue from natural gas exports and
continued import growth. At the same time, FDI inflows fell short of expectations in FY 2015/16,
partly reflecting a pre-election wait-and-see approach to disbursement of committed investment. As
a result, foreign reserves at the CBM fell to 2.6 months of prospective imports at end-March 2016
and further to 2.3 months at end-October, well below the estimated adequate level of 5–6 months
of prospective imports (Box 3). In addition, the foreign exchange (FX) position of state-owned

banks (SOBs) has also declined (Figure 1).2 Mirroring the weaker BOP position, the kyat has fallen in
value, having depreciated by about 17 percent against the U.S. dollar from mid-2015 to
end-November 2016. However, in real effective terms the kyat moderately appreciated, due to
Myanmar’s high inflation.
8.
Staff projects a recovery in economic activity in coming months. This outlook is
underpinned by an expected recovery in construction activity in Yangon and FDI inflows and
increased development partner disbursements in the second half of FY 2016/17—following the
resumption of both construction permit and FDI approval processes. Inflation is expected to remain
elevated at 7 percent on average in FY 2016/17. Financial deepening will continue to boost credit
growth, albeit at a more moderate pace as the stock of credit rises and slower economic activity
(relative to previous years) weighs on demand. The fiscal deficit is projected to increase slightly to
4.6 percent of GDP in FY 2016/17, while the external current account deficit is likely to increase
further to about 6.5 percent of GDP. The CBM’s foreign reserves are projected at 2.3 months of
prospective imports, before gradually improving on account of improved foreign exchange inflows,
including from FDI and development partner inflows as noted above.
9.
Despite the positive outlook, risks are weighted towards the downside and challenges
to maintain macrofinancial stability are significant.


Downside risk arises from concerns over policy clarity. Delays in phasing out CBM financing of
the fiscal deficit could prolong high inflation, lowering real incomes, real interest rates, and
external competitiveness. Rapid credit growth over the recent past may have weakened banks’
balance sheets, which remain opaque. Weak gas prices and inefficiencies are weighing on SEE
performance and thus government revenues. Natural disasters continue to pose significant risks
to the economy, as shown by last year’s floods and the earthquake earlier this year.3



On the external front, commodity prices remain a key risk, with lower gas prices dampening
export receipts and government revenues. In addition, risks continue to arise from volatile
global financial markets and the rebalancing of the Chinese economy. The potential for change
in U.S. economic policy towards Asia as a result of the recent U.S. elections creates additional
uncertainty.

10.
Should these downside risks materialize, Myanmar’s economy would grow below
potential in the near term and could even see the potential growth rate reduced over the
longer run (Text Chart). A slow or stalled reform process—including a continued high level of

for Myanmar’s long-term growth potential). Despite the modest size of the growth gain, faster
reform implementation would improve the sustainability of growth through lowering debt and
strengthening the external position, thereby reducing downside risks. For this scenario to materialize,
a strong and coherent set of policies needs to be put in place quickly, which would lead to early
phase out of central bank financing, accelerated structural reforms (e.g., strong revenue and PFM
efforts, SEE and SOB restructuring, and financial sector reform), and a boost to business confidence
that would underpin strong FDI and aid inflows.

11.
The authorities have taken a number of steps to address downside risks, many of
which were identified in past Article IV consultations (Appendix I). In particular, they have for the
first time outlined a plan gradually to phase out central bank financing of the fiscal deficit and
launched a T-bond auction earlier this year. Significant progress has been made in revenue
administration, and reform of public financial management is accelerating. The parliament has
approved the Financial Institutions Law (FIL), and the CBM has brought banks in compliance with
reserve requirements and made impressive strides in bank supervision. Nevertheless, continued
efforts are needed to reduce macro imbalances and reduce financial sector risks, including through
greater exchange rate flexibility and expeditious issuance of key prudential regulations.

Authorities’ views
12.
The authorities broadly shared the staff’s assessment of recent developments, the
outlook and risks. They agreed with staff’s growth outlook and concurred that factors weighing on
growth in the first half of 2016/17 were temporary and that activity should pick up in the coming
months. They were also concerned about persistent macroeconomic imbalances, and their forecasts
of inflation and the current account balance were in line with staff projections. The authorities
broadly agreed with staff’s assessment of risks, but considered risks to growth to be more balanced.
They highlighted external risks, given the continued effects of low commodity prices and weak
export demand on the trade balance and the exchange rate. The authorities noted that the new
government was taking steps to improve the business environment, including the recent passage of
the Investment Law and strengthened communications with the business community.

SAFEGUARDING MACROFINANCIAL STABILITY WHILE
LAYING FOUNDATIONS FOR INCLUSIVE GROWTH
Achieving these twin objectives calls for a strengthened policy mix. Safeguarding macrofinancial
stability requires tighter monetary conditions, greater exchange rate flexibility, and swift actions to
continue strengthening bank regulation and supervision. While the current level of fiscal deficit is
broadly appropriate in view of the huge development needs, the authorities should prioritize the
phasing-out of monetary financing to help anchor inflation and exchange rate expectations.
Meanwhile, to improve key infrastructure and social services, continued fiscal reforms to mobilize
required domestic revenue are needed along with improved expenditure efficiency. Together with
further reforms of the financial sector and business regulation, these are critical to creating conditions
for inclusive growth.

A. Ensuring Exchange Rate Flexibility for External Stability
13.
Greater exchange rate flexibility is needed to strengthen the external position. As
noted earlier, despite nominal depreciation against the dollar, the kyat has appreciated moderately
in real effective terms due to higher domestic inflation relative to trading partners. The real
appreciation has not been offset by commensurate productivity improvements, and as a result, the
real exchange rate is assessed to be moderately overvalued (Box 3). This assessment is consistent
with the observed weakening of Myanmar’s external position, including the falling net FX assets of
SOBs. Staff took note of the authorities’ concern over the impact of exchange rate depreciation on
inflation and stressed the need for tighter monetary policy to prevent potential feedback effects
between inflation and exchange rate depreciation. Staff also encouraged the authorities to
strengthen communications on their policies which should help guide exchange rate expectations.
14.
The exchange rate needs to be set through a transparent mechanism that reflects
market conditions, in line with the de jure managed float regime. Staff continues to support
Myanmar’s managed float exchange rate regime, which has helped to mitigate terms of trade
shocks with limited foreign reserves. In order for the exchange rate regime to fulfill this important
role, the CBM needs to conduct the daily FX auction in a manner to serve as a price discovery
mechanism, rather than a signaling device (Box 4). Specifically, the cut-off rate, or the reference rate,
at the auction must reflect demand and supply conditions in the broad, deep parallel markets to
avoid persistent excess demand at the auction.4 The misalignment between the auction rate and
parallel market rates is detrimental to the long-term objective of achieving a unified, deep FX
market, and to the exchange rate adjustment necessary for strengthening the external position. If
the authorities are unable to change their current practice in conducting the auction, an alternative
mechanism to set the exchange rate could be explored, such as setting the exchange rate based on
market transactions, and accelerating inter-bank market development. However, should an
alternative be pursued, any rate setting mechanism must operate in a transparent and independent
4

However, staff has not identified at this time instances of shortages in the formal FX market.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MYANMAR

manner. In addition, the government and SEEs would need to commit to using the new marketbased reference rate for their FX transactions.
15.
Continued structural reform is critical to strengthening Myanmar’s external position in
the longer run. Staff estimates that the CBM’s current FX reserves are well below the estimated
adequate level of 5–6 months of prospective imports, and baseline projections suggest a slow
accumulation over the medium term. Tighter monetary policy and a flexible exchange rate, together
with automatic transfer of state-owned foreign exchange from SOBs to the CBM, are key to
preventing FX reserves from declining further. Moreover, Myanmar needs to deepen structural
reforms in order to strengthen its external position on a sustained basis. Apart from infrastructure
impediments (for example, inadequate electricity supply and transport networks), the business
community considers onerous regulation and limited credit access for SMEs and agriculture to be
major constraints to growth, including of exports. Staff encourages the development of a coherent
plan to create an enabling environment for private enterprise, building on the existing national
export strategy supported by the Diagnostic Trade Integration Study, national financial inclusion
roadmap, and the Investment Law. In addition, staff encourages the timely release of regulations
under the Investment Law and expeditious approval of the company law. These reforms would also
help contain Myanmar’s risk of debt distress, which is assessed to be low on account of prudent
fiscal policy and expected broadening of the export base over time (see the Debt Sustainability
Analysis).

Authorities’ views
16.
The authorities remained committed to the managed float exchange rate regime,
while expressing concern about continued depreciation pressures. They recognized the
importance of sound fiscal and monetary policies in anchoring the exchange rate and agreed that a
more flexible reference rate was needed to unify the foreign exchange markets. However, the
authorities were concerned about a potential depreciation-inflation spiral, and found it challenging
to manage communications on the exchange rate regime and currency volatility in light of the
public’s desire for exchange rate stability. In this context, the CBM welcomed the discussion of
options in setting the reference rate, and requested TA to study the feasibility of a fixing regime
based on market transactions. The CBM believed that such a regime would help ease its
communication challenge by attributing exchange rate volatility more to the market than mainly to
the CBM.

B. Tightening Monetary Policy to Contain Inflation
17.
Despite the recent economic slowdown, a stimulatory monetary policy is inappropriate
at this juncture, as inflation and exchange rate pressures persist. A tighter monetary policy
stance is needed to reduce inflation and depreciation pressures on the exchange rate. High inflation
has eroded the purchasing power of households and negatively affected investment and
competitiveness. In addition, rising inflation has pushed down real interest rates, reducing returns to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MYANMAR

depositors and making it more difficult for lenders to price credit risk as nominal lending and
deposit interest rates are administratively set (paragraphs 28 and 29).
18.
Staff encourages the authorities to accelerate the phase-out of monetary financing of
the fiscal deficit. The government plans to cap central bank financing at 40 percent of domestic
financing in FY 2016/17, with gradual declines thereafter. While welcoming the right direction this
plan sets, staff continues to recommend a faster switch from CBM to domestic market financing,
over the next two years, and stress the importance of market-determined interest rates in attracting
investors at the T-bill and T-bond auctions. The recent change to allow foreign banks to participate
in the government securities auctions is a positive step.
19.
To prevent high inflation from becoming entrenched, the CBM should step up deposit
auctions to mop up liquidity. Bringing banks into compliance with reserve requirements and
issuing the instruction to impose automatic penalties on non-compliant banks, have been important
achievements. To attract sufficient volumes of bank deposits, the CBM should ensure that the
interest rate at the deposit auctions is fully determined by the market.
20.
Adopting a medium-term inflation objective would help improve monetary policy
communication and anchor inflation expectations. Staff considers an inflation objective of
around 5 percent as appropriate, in keeping with inflation targets/objectives for peer countries at
similar stages of development. The objective should be framed as a medium-term guide rather than
a fully fledged inflation target. By guiding reserve money targets the objective would clarify the
nominal anchor for the economy, facilitating monetary policy communication and the setting of
inflation expectations. To strengthen the design and implementation of monetary policy, staff
encouraged the CBM to set up a monetary policy committee, supported by a monetary policy
working group.

Authorities’ views
21.
While acknowledging the inflationary impact of CBM financing of the fiscal deficit, the
authorities preferred a gradual approach to phasing out such financing due to concerns about
the increased cost to the budget of market financing. They also believed that a gradual approach
would help ensure that targets are achievable in switching to market financing. The authorities
recognized that such a switch would require a major scaling up of treasury auctions and close
cooperation between the CBM and the Ministry of Planning and Finance. Having granted permission
for foreign banks in Myanmar to participate in the T-bill and T-bond auctions, the authorities
expected treasury issuance to grow over time as interest rates were increasingly determined by the
market. The CBM welcomed staff’s recommendation to set a medium-term inflation objective and
noted its intention to continue using the reserve money targeting framework to manage liquidity
and respond to inflation, with continued enforcement of reserve requirements and scaling up of
deposit auctions as needed.

C. Balancing Fiscal Sustainability and Development Needs
22.
The FY 2015/16 fiscal outcome was broadly in line with an adequate medium-term
target that is consistent with long-term debt sustainability, and a prudent fiscal stance will
help anchor inflation and exchange rate expectations. Debt sustainability analysis suggests that a
fiscal deficit of around 4½ percent of GDP over the medium term would be consistent with keeping
Myanmar at low risk of debt distress while providing some fiscal space to respond to shocks,
including frequent, climate-related natural disasters.5 In addition to phasing out central bank
financing, deeper reforms to mobilize domestic revenue are needed (see below), and the authorities
should continue to prioritize expenditure on critical infrastructure and social services while
improving efficiency, and containing fiscal risks—especially those emerging from SEEs (including
SOBs) as well as public private partnerships.
23.
Building on considerable achievements, it is time for the next phase of revenue
reform. Myanmar has significantly improved revenue administration, including by establishing a
large taxpayer office (LTO), with general government revenue (excluding grants) rising from
12 percent of GDP in FY 2011/12 to around 20 percent in FY 2015/16.6 Myanmar now needs to
tackle its tax system at a deeper level, including updating tax legislation, beginning with the income
tax law. Meanwhile, high-level commitment will be needed to accelerate the reform of SEEs, to
improve their efficiency and revenue contribution, while reducing contingent liabilities, including
those in the banking sector. Over time, Myanmar should also tap its large revenue potential in the
mining sector, building on good progress made in implementing the EITI. Priority actions on the
revenue front include the following:


Rationalize tax exemptions and investment incentives. As the first step, tax expenditures should
be presented in annual budgets to increase

24.
Sustained efforts are needed to improve the efficiency of public spending and build
fiscal buffers for future shocks. As the authorities continue to prioritize spending on key
infrastructure and service delivery, greater attention needs to be paid to balanced allocation within
sectors to achieve better development outcomes. Moreover, the authorities should continue to
improve the medium-term fiscal framework, better integrate recurrent and capital expenditures,
strengthen in-year monitoring and reporting (which would be greatly facilitated by automation), and
improve cash management. To put these reforms on a sound legal footing, the authorities should
ensure early approval of the Financial Rules and Regulations while preparing ground for a Public
Financial Management (PFM) law. Given Myanmar’s vulnerability to natural disasters, more
budgetary resources should be allocated to reserves to meet contingency spending needs.7

Authorities’ views
25.
The authorities broadly concurred with staff’s recommendations. They intended to keep
the fiscal deficit within 3–4 percent of GDP (authorities’ accounting method definition) for 2017/18
and over the medium term, and were committed to maintaining a low risk of debt distress. The
authorities fully recognized the importance of revenue mobilization and were working closely with
the Fund and other development partners to continue deepening reforms including by moving to
Phase II of revenue reform. On expenditure management, the authorities planned to release an
update on the Financial Rules and Regulations in the near term while preparing the groundwork for
a PFM Law. Improving the performance of SEEs was a key policy priority, and the authorities were
working with development partners to formulate a reform strategy. Increasing investment in key
infrastructure and social services remained a priority for the authorities, though they noted the
constraints on absorptive capacity in the short term.

D. Addressing Financial Sector Risks and Improving Intermediation
26.
The financial sector reform agenda is well underway. A new FIL was passed in early
2016, and progress has been made in finalizing regulations and strengthening supervision.
Important advances have been made in undertaking full-scope bank examinations, and financial
soundness indicators (excluding SOBs) have been developed with a view to publication in 2017.
Efforts to extend T-bill maturity, the launch of T-bond auctions, and the recent change to allow
foreign banks to participate in treasury auctions have been welcome. In addition, banks now fully
comply with reserve requirements, as noted above. Given progress in improving the AML/CFT
regime, Myanmar is no longer subject to the FATF’s monitoring process under its on-going global
AML/CFT compliance process. Ongoing work to address outstanding AML/CFT issues, including
preparing for the national risk assessment, remains a priority.
27.
Further reforms are needed given a growing, largely opaque, and undercapitalized
financial system. Despite the recent slowdown in credit growth, and the fact that credit is extended
in local currency and funded by deposits, concerns remain regarding the quality of banks’ assets
7

See footnote 5.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MYANMAR

given the limited availability of prudential data, ever-greening practices, concentration risk, and
weak risk management. The banking system in general remains undercapitalized relative to risks,
and the CBM is working with several banks to bring capital levels up to the requirements of the FIL.
However, this process is being impeded by delays in the issuance of supporting regulations for the
FIL, including those on capital adequacy and asset classifications. At the same time, growth in the
number of banks operating in Myanmar continues to stretch supervisory capacity—arguing against
permitting additional banks to enter the market until supervisory capacity has been substantially
strengthened.
28.
Reform of systemically important SOBs should be accelerated. Although their
dominance of the financial system has declined, SOBs retain the largest network of bank branches
and attract 36 percent of national deposits. Given the large amount of deposits at the SOBs and
their poor financial conditions, key objectives of reform should include minimizing risks to the
financial system and public finance, and to improve financial intermediation and inclusion. An
immediate priority is to clarify the SOB’s capital and net FX open positions. Ultimately, a
restructuring plan needs to be formulated to guide the reform process, building on the World
Bank’s continued support in this area.
29.
Despite the rapid credit growth over the last few years, agriculture and small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have been underserved. With nearly two-thirds of households
engaged in agriculture, this sector is key to inclusive growth. However, productivity levels are low
due to the lack of modern inputs and technologies (seeds, fertilizer, irrigation facilities, and postharvest services). In part this reflects lack of access to credit. Extensive controls in the wake of past
banking crises—including a floor on deposit rates (8 percent) and a ceiling on lending rates
(13 percent)—have made it difficult for farm households and SMEs to access credit. Over the past
year, high inflation has exacerbated financial repression and there has been growing call for rapid
liberalization of interest rates, which could bring large benefits. However, Myanmar is not yet ready
for full liberalization of interest rates, and needs to continue working on the necessary conditions,
including by further strengthening bank regulation and supervision, improving banks’ risk
management, and anchoring inflation expectations.
30.
Staff recommends a carefully sequenced increase in lending interest rates, supported
by appropriate complementary policies. Higher, tiered lending rates for new loan products
permitted under the FIL (including unsecured and secured on moveable collateral) should be
allowed, to help develop an interest rate structure for loans of longer than one year. In view of the
critical need to improve access to finance for agriculture and SMEs, the authorities could also raise
the interest rate caps on microfinance loans, along with measures to ensure their adequate
supervision and regulation. Staff also encourages the authorities to consider complementary policy
measures to ensure that the benefits of gradual financial liberalization are widely distributed. For
example, improving rural infrastructure (particularly electricity supply and transport networks, which
would increase access to mobile banking and bank branches), financial literacy, and business book
keeping, as well as establishing a credit bureau, would help rural households and SMEs share the
benefits of financial liberalization. Liberalization of interest rates without complementary measures

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

MYANMAR

to improve financial access to the rural population and SMEs could increase income inequality, as
the bulk of the benefits from liberalization would accrue to businesses and households that already
have access to finance.8
31.

Current priority actions for financial sector reform include the following: 9



Issue and enforce bank regulations as soon as possible. This would empower the supervisors to
enforce the FIL.



Complete full-scope bank examinations of all banks (including state-owned and policy banks),
identify and audit weak banks, and require capital and liquidity recovery plans to meet new
regulatory requirements.



Further increase the size and training of the supervision team at the CBM, including on AML/CFT.



Resource the function at the CBM to develop plans for bank recovery and resolution, to enable the
CBM to deal with weak banks using its new FIL powers and to develop lender of last resort
capabilities.

Authorities’ views
32.
The authorities broadly shared staff’s views on financial sector risks and reform
priorities and were moving forward with their reform agenda. They were near completion of
full-scope examinations of all banks, and were targeting end-March 2017 for issuing five key
regulations to implement the FIL. With regard to bank capital adequacy, the authorities were
committed to implementing, as the next step, more stringent capital requirements aligned closely
with enhanced international standards. The authorities appreciated the importance of strengthening
the supervision team and were seeking more resources while continuing with training. They planned
to accelerate interbank money market development and contingency planning for bank recovery
and resolution, and have requested TA in both areas. With regard to gradual liberalization of interest
rates, they preferred to change bank lending and deposit rates simultaneously but keep rates on
microfinancing low.

CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER ISSUES

Myanmar is a top recipient of Fund capacity development resources and has made
substantial progress in strengthening capacity (Appendix III).10 Staff exchanged views with the

The authorities welcomed Fund assistance and provided feedback on how to enhance the
effectiveness of Fund capacity development, including through early engagement and close
interactions at the planning and delivery stages and tailoring Fund recommendations to capacity
constraints to improve short-term absorption and long-term sustainability.
34.
Statistics. Improvement has been made in reducing the time lags in releasing data, and the
recent rebased CPI series is a major achievement. However, data shortcomings continue to hamper
surveillance significantly, particularly in the areas of external sector and government finance
statistics. Sustained efforts will be needed for further progress (Information Annex III), and staff
appreciated the authorities’ strong commitment to improving statistics.
35.
Article VIII issues. The authorities plan to accept Myanmar’s obligations under Article VIII
soon. An exchange restriction relating to transfer of salaries abroad was removed with the passage
of the FIL, and work is in progress to remove the last remaining exchange restriction, relating to a
tax certification requirement. The authorities have requested Fund approval of the multiple currency
practice arising from the multiple-price FX auction.

STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
The successful general elections in November 2015 ushered in a historic period of
political and socioeconomic transition. Peace and national reconciliation will help lay the
foundation for stability and shared prosperity, and continued economic reform is integral to this
great endeavor. Maintaining economic and financial stability is important for the transition.
37.
Greater exchange rate flexibility is critical to strengthening Myanmar’s external
position and developing a fully unified FX market. Staff continues to support the managed float
regime and encourages the CBM to conduct the daily FX auction in a competitive manner, which
would minimize the exchange rate spread between the formal and informal markets. Should it be
impossible to achieve these objectives under the auction regime, the authorities could explore an
alternative way of setting the reference rate based on prices of market transactions.
38.
Monetary policy should be tightened by phasing out CBM financing of the fiscal
deficit and stepping up deposit auctions to mop up liquidity. These steps are essential to
containing inflation and reducing pressure on the exchange rate. Market-determined interest rates
for treasury securities are required to ensure the successful transition from CBM to domestic market
financing. Staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to phasing out monetary deficit financing
and encourages a more ambitious pace.
39.
Deeper fiscal reforms are needed to balance development and sustainability needs. The
current fiscal stance is appropriate, and the authorities should keep the fiscal deficit in check going
forward to build fiscal buffers and maintain low risk of debt distress. To finance large needs for
infrastructure development and social services, domestic revenue mobilization should move to the
next level, including reform to tax legislation, building on the success of the first phase of reform. At

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

MYANMAR

the same time, continued efforts are required to ensure effective prioritization and implementation
of expenditure plans.
40.
Further financial sector reform is critical to safeguarding financial stability and
improving financial intermediation. Rapid credit growth and lack of transparency in the banking
system could pose systemic risks and contingent fiscal liabilities. Staff commends the authorities for
passing the FIL and strengthening supervisory capacity, and continues to urge the authorities to
issue supporting regulations for the FIL soon, and to formulate an SOB reform plan.
41.
Staff appreciates the authorities’ commitment to improving macroeconomic statistics,
and envisages a full capacity development agenda. Building on good progress, further
development of macroeconomic statistics is needed to better inform policy decision making and
improve transparency. Staff looks forward to continuing capacity development work with Myanmar
in statistics and other policy areas.
42.
Staff supports the authorities’ request for approval of a multiple currency practice
subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII, Section 3. The MCP arises from the mechanism of
the foreign exchange auction which allows for a multiplicity of winning bids (Information Annex on
Fund Relations), and is maintained principally for non-balance of payments reasons. The MCP does
not materially impede the member’s balance of payments adjustment, harm the interests of other
members, or discriminate among members; it is temporary; and the authorities are unable to replace
it at present. Staff therefore recommends Executive Board approval for its retention until January 18,
2018 or the conclusion of the next Article IV consultation, whichever is earlier. The authorities did
not request, and staff does recommend, approval of the exchange restriction maintained
inconsistent with Article VIII obligations.
43.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

Box 1. Myanmar: Recent Inflation Dynamics1
Myanmar’s inflation has been persistently above 10 percent since mid-2015, apart from recent data that
has reflected base effects from the flood.2 The higher inflation rates appear to have mainly resulted from rising
food prices, which represented more than two-thirds of the CPI basket. This can partly be explained by the severe
floods in July–September 2015, caused by Cyclone ‘Komen’. However, the double-digit inflation has been more
persistent than can be explained by supply shocks alone. This box, therefore, aims to analyze other possible factors
that have been driving inflation dynamics in recent years.
Using quarterly data from 2005:Q1 to 2016:Q2, inflation in Myanmar is found to be driven by its past
dynamics, reserve money supply, international food prices, public sector wage growth, and exchange rate
depreciation (pass-through effect).3 Past dynamics have contributed to approximately 40 percent of
contemporaneous inflation for the whole period of the study. However, this contribution declined during the
period 2011–2016:Q2 whereas changes in the exchange rate and money supply have increasingly driven inflation
dynamics. Public sector wage growth has also contributed to inflation in the latter period. This includes the latest
increase of public wages in FY 2015/16, which occurred at around the same time as the floods and may have
contributed to inflation persistence.
A variance decomposition of inflation confirms the role of past inflation, the exchange rate, and money
supply in driving inflation dynamics. For the first year, exchange rate pass-through explained around 20 percent
of inflation variation, international food prices around 7 percent, and money supply around 5 percent. Over the
medium term, exchange rate pass-through and changes in money supply have gained further explanatory power,
contributing approximately 30 percent and 25 percent, respectively, to inflation variance. International food prices
have a minimal contribution to inflation variation over the medium term.
The above results suggest that a tighter monetary will be required to bring down persistently high
inflation. Monetization of the increased fiscal deficit in 2015/16 contributed significantly to the expansion of
reserve money. At the same time, the CBM has not mopped up excess liquidity sufficiently through deposit
auctions to offset deficit monetization. Although inflation itself is likely to have contributed to exchange rate
depreciation, a rising current account deficit suggests that aggregate demand has outpaced domestic supply,
putting pressure on the exchange rate.

Box 2. Myanmar: Potential Growth1
Reliable estimates of potential output are critical to
formulating an appropriate macroeconomic policy
framework. They are an essential input for calculating output
gaps that help policymakers determine the cyclical position of
the economy and for designing sustainable macroeconomic
policies over the medium and long run. In the case of Myanmar,
there has been limited empirical work in estimating its potential
output even though rapid structural change over the last few
years has made it imperative to gauge the country’s new growth
potential. This box presents preliminary results from three
approaches: analysis of historical comparisons, the HP filter, and
the Cobb-Douglass production function.

Myanmar’s growth potential is substantial based on the
experience of its regional peers. The growth record of
Cambodia, China, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam suggests that,
with appropriate policies, high growth in the range of
7-8 percent can be sustained over a relatively long period of
time. Myanmar’s per capita income today (about US$1,400 in
constant 2011 PPP U.S. dollars) is similar to the levels of these
countries (US$1,000-2,000 in constant PPP U.S. dollars) when
they embarked on economic reforms and subsequently
achieved sustained growth at 7-8 percent per year. China
achieved even higher growth.
The results from the other two approaches also suggest that
Myanmar can achieve long-term growth in the 7-8 percent
range. Both the HP filter and production function approaches
show a notable pickup in trend growth since 2011 when
Myanmar embarked on political and economic reforms (Charts 2
and 3). The estimated production function shows that the
growth contribution of total factor productivity (TFP) has been
rising in recent years, although the pace of factor
accumulation—at 10 percent per year for capital and 1.1 percent
for labor force since 2011—has been modest compared with
that in neighboring countries during their economic expansion.
Myanmar needs to take advantage of its current position to
emulate the successes of its neighbors. The slowdown of
global economic growth since the Global Financial Crisis makes
it more difficult for Myanmar to increase its exports to advanced countries. However, China’s rebalancing and moving up
value chains have provided Myanmar with opportunities to export labor-intensive products and services, including
through attracting Chinese FDI and tourists. Over the long run, there is also potential for Myanmar to export laborintensive manufactured goods directly to China, in addition to agricultural and horticultural products. For this to
materialize, Myanmar needs to continue improving its productivity, particularly given its low fertility rate that reduces
demographic dividends. Continued efforts to build up human capital and integrate with regional economies are key to
achieving sustained growth.

improvement, and falling international reserves over the past
year.

Model-based estimates of the external position suggest the kyat is now moderately overvalued. All three
IMF models—the Current Account (CA), REER, and external sustainability (ES) approaches—show that the real
exchange rate (RER) is moderately stronger than the level consistent with external balance, medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policy settings (Table 1). The CA approach suggests an RER overvaluation of
3.3 percent in 2016/17, but after adjusting for the adverse flood effects, the overvaluation disappears. The REER
approach suggests a somewhat

Anecdotal evidence suggests
Myanmar has lost some
competitiveness over the past year. There have been increasing complaints by domestic producers that imports,
including possibly smuggled imports, of processed foods, have posed strong competition to domestic products. It
has also been reported that Myanmar rice, a major foreign exchange earner for the country, has also been facing
sluggish demand overseas because it is too expensive. Thus it appears that rising domestic inflation has
contributed to the loss of competitiveness, which also continues to be hampered by non-price factors. Business
surveys show that despite low wages, weak domestic supply chains and poor access to electricity, transport
services and affordable financing are major impediments to business activity.
Improving competitiveness would also help improve the CBM’s foreign reserves buffer, which is assessed
to be far below the estimated adequate level. At end-September 2016 the CBM’s net foreign reserves stood at
US$4.5 billion and covered about 2.3 months of prospective imports, well below the estimated adequate level of
5-6 months of imports.3 Inadequate reserves also suggest that it is important for the CBM to maintain a flexible
exchange rate to absorb external shocks.

estimates put Myanmar’s current NFA at -22.5 percent of GDP. It is assumed that with large development
needs, Myanmar will increasingly rely on foreign saving over the next 20 years, pushing NFA to -40 percent of GDP.
3

This estimate is based on the method set out in IMF Board Paper SM/14/334, which results in a reserve adequacy metric
of 4 months of imports for a free floating exchange rate regime. However, given Myanmar’s vulnerability to natural
disasters and the fact that its exchange rate de facto is not fully flexible, the metric has been revised upwards.

The auction has been under stress over the past two
years and its function has been undermined by
failures to adhere to the rules. The auction served its
purposes well in most of the period up to late 2014,
when a strengthening of the U.S. dollar and adverse
terms of trade shocks led the CBM to deviate from the
well-designed auction rules. The reference rate has
frequently deviated from the parallel market rate by
more than 0.8 percent and the CBM has limited FX sales
at the auction (see the chart below).1 At deviations of
such magnitude, authorized dealers that are bound by
the band cannot compete with dealers in the parallel
markets. Although technical difficulties contributed to
some of the deviations, as parallel market rates have
drifted away from the reference rate after it is set in the
morning auction, heavy smoothing of the reference rate
by the CBM has been the main reason for the
deviations. Such smoothing occurs when the CBM does
not determine the cut off rate based on broad demand
and supply conditions. In such instances the CBM no
longer makes the bid allocation on the basis of relative
prices.

Deviation Between Reference and Informal Market Rates

Mar-15

Myanmar’s exchange rate regime is underpinned by
a daily foreign exchange auction. The multi-price,
two-way auction was designed to enable authorized
dealers—mostly domestic banks—to bid for purchase
and sale of FX in a competitive manner. The cut-off rate,
which is intended to maximize market transactions and
equilibrate demand and supply, is set in the early
morning each day to serve as the reference rate for the
day for the formal market—trade between authorized
dealers, customers, and the CBM and the government.
There is a trading band of 0.8 percent on either side of
the reference rate.

Box 5. Myanmar: Domestic Revenue Mobilization1
Myanmar has one of the lowest tax revenue collections in the world with high potential to collect more. Tax
revenues total 7.5 percent of GDP, compared to the regional average of 14.6 percent. Less than half of the total
revenue is derived from taxes. IMF estimates a ratio of 15 percent tax to GDP is needed to achieve sustainable
growth. A revenue mobilization program began in 2012 based on IMF recommendations.
The revenue reform momentum achieved by the Internal Revenue Department (IRD) is very encouraging.
Since 2012 tax revenues have increased on average by around 20 percent year-on-year. The new Large Taxpayer
Office (LTO) became operational in 2014, and is adopting international good practice for a self-assessment system.
Compliance by large taxpayers with core tax obligations (registration, on-time filing and payment) is nearing
international good practice. Policy reforms include a separate excise tax (Specific Goods Tax) and some reform of
the commercial tax; and the IRD headquarters was restructured to introduce some modern management and
governance practices.
Nevertheless, strategic revenue reforms of this nature need continuous and unwavering political
commitment and support from key stakeholders including development partners. Good progress has been
made in formulating an updated reform plan, which forms the basis of communications and priorities for Phase II
(2017-2022) of the reform program. Phase II needs to focus on:








Modernizing the tax policy and legislation framework to increase certainty of tax liability and remove
loopholes – start with income tax and a unified tax procedure law to streamline taxpayers’ rights and
obligations across all tax types.
Extending the new processes and systems to medium size taxpayers.
Introducing a new technology system. Sufficient budget will be needed to allow this to happen.
Recruiting experienced staff and developing existing staff to match the skills of professional tax advisors in
the private sector.
Developing an environment of integrity and good governance with modern human resource
management practices to provide transparency of taxpayer rights and mechanisms that guarantee integrity.
Building strong political support and stronger public understanding about the importance of taxation.

Reforms in the Myanmar Customs Department (MCD) are in their early stages but some progress has been
made. MCD has progressively received more assistance from the IMF and some recommendations have been
partly implemented. Greater recognition of the importance of the Strategic Plan and the operational plan would
help strengthen reform traction in MCD. MCD should focus on: upgrading its capacity to scan the environment
and develop and manage the reform program on its own, developing the MCD information and communication
technology strategy; and implementing effective management systems and practices, including human resource
management.
The MCD will need ongoing external assistance and support. This support will be most needed in: (i)
consolidating and modernizing the customs legislation; (ii) introducing modern risk-based procedures; and (iii)
reinforcing powers and capacities in the detection and investigation of commercial fraud. Procedures and
processes will have to be reviewed, rationalized and simplified to reflect opportunities offered by new technology,
e.g., the Myanmar Automated Customs Clearance System (MACCS).

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective
assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50
percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Exchange Rate Arrangement
The kyat had been pegged to the SDR at K 8.5057 per SDR since May 2, 1977. On April 1, 2012, the
authorities replaced the official peg to the SDR with a managed float. The Central Bank of Myanmar
(CBM) started daily two-way multiple-price foreign currency auctions with technical assistance (TA)
provided by the Monetary and Capital Markets Department (MCM). The auctions provide a
mechanism for the market to determine an exchange rate that the CBM can use to set its new
reference rate. However, the CBM reserves the right to intervene to moderate excessive exchange
rate volatility in the foreign exchange market. The de jure exchange rate arrangement was
reclassified as managed float, and the de facto exchange rate regime is classified as other managed
arrangement.
Myanmar continues to avail itself of transitional arrangements under Article XIV, although it has
eliminated all Article XIV restrictions. Myanmar has made significant progress toward satisfying
Article VIII obligations. Almost all current account restrictions have been removed through the
implementation of the 2012 Foreign Exchange Management Law. However, Myanmar still maintains
an exchange restriction and a multiple currency practice (MCP) subject to Fund approval under
Article VIII. The exchange restriction subject to Fund jurisdiction arises from the requirement of tax
certification for authorizing transfers of net investment income abroad. The MCP arises from the
two-way, multi-price foreign currency auction in the absence of a mechanism for maintaining
winning bids within 2 percent of each other, and the authorities have sought a further IMF approval
of the retention of this MCP.
Article IV Consultation
Myanmar is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation
discussions were conducted on June 17–July 1, 2015 in Yangon and Nay Pyi Taw. The Executive
Board concluded the 2015 Article IV consultation on August 28, 2015.
Technical Assistance
Myanmar is now one of the largest recipients of IMF technical assistance (TA). Delivery is through a
mix of resident advisors; experts in the Bangkok-based Technical Assistance Office for Lao P.D.R.
and Myanmar (TAOLAM) and short-term HQ and expert missions. The key areas of focus are:


Central Banking: a resident foreign exchange advisor and a monetary operations advisor based
in TAOLAM provided frequent responsive advice, supported by HQ missions. In addition, regular
expert missions were conducted in order to assist the CBM strengthen its accounting framework
and systems. Both advisors have completed their assignments, and their replacements are
scheduled to take duty over the coming months.



Financial Sector Supervision: work in this area is led by a resident advisor in Yangon supported
by HQ and expert missions. AML/CFT TA is delivered by HQ staff and short-term expert.



Revenue Reform: a resident tax administration advisor is supported by HQ and expert missions
aimed at modernizing the Internal Revenue Department (IRD). Work on tax policy is delivered
through HQ missions.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MYANMAR



Public Financial Management: the focus is on capacity development of the Treasury Department,
following its establishment in September 2014, which was led by an advisor based in TAOLAM
and supported by HQ and expert missions.



Statistics: the work plan in this area has been developed following a multi-sector diagnostic
mission in 2013. As a result, external sector and government finance statistics advisors have
taken up duties in TAOLAM and expert visits continue to assist in the development of price
statistics. A rebased CPI was released in August 2016.



Macroeconomic Analysis: an advisor based in TAOLAM leads the work in this area that is closely
integrated with the broader IMF training program.

In all areas the IMF coordinates closely with other development partners. In the financial sector, the
IMF team has assisted the Central Bank of Myanmar in developing a framework for coordination of
international technical assistance.
Resident Representative
Mr. Yasuhisa Ojima has been the Resident Representative of the country and stationed in Yangon,
since September 2015.
The Technical Assistance Office for Lao P.D.R. and Myanmar (TAOLAM)
The IMF opened TAOLAM in Bangkok in October 2012. The new office has been providing IMF
technical assistance and training, in collaboration with the Bank of Thailand and the Government of
Japan. There are currently four TA advisors in the office, covering public financial management,
macroeconomics training, government financial statistics, and external sector statistics, for both Lao
P.D. R. and Myanmar. TA and training have recently been extended to Cambodia and Vietnam.
Mr. David Cowen has headed the office since September 2015.

WORLD BANK-IMF COLLABORATION
(November 2016)
The Fund and the Bank country teams for Myanmar, led by Mr. Yang (International Monetary
Fund, IMF) and by Mr. Zachau (World Bank Group, WBG), maintain excellent working relations
and dialogue on macroeconomic and structural issues.
The level of cooperation and coordination is strong, and is becoming more regular as both
institutions have been scaling up their engagement in Myanmar. Staffs routinely share country
documents prepared by both institutions for their respective Executive Boards and collaborate
regularly in areas of mutual interest.
Following the clearance of arrears to the International Development Association (IDA) in
January 2013, the Bank has resumed normal lending relations with Myanmar and the
International Finance Corporation (IFC) commenced its investment and advisory activities. A
pre-arrears clearance IDA grant to finance a National Community Driven Development Project
preceded an initial Development Policy Operation in support of a program around macroeconomic
stability and arrears clearance. Since then, 10 IDA financed projects have been approved by the
Executive Board of Directors with commitments exceeding US$1.5 billion in electricity,
telecommunications, public financial management, education, health, agriculture, and river basin
management. The IFC has made investments in infrastructure, microfinance, hospitality and banking
sectors and is developing its pipeline of investments in several sectors. The WBG has also
significantly scaled up its analytical and advisory services.
Following the completion of the 2013 Staff Monitored Program, the IMF is continuing to
provide intensive policy advice and technical assistance to Myanmar. On the surveillance side,
annual Article IV consultations are supplemented with regular staff visits and frequent engagement
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

through the resident representative office which was opened in 2013. Technical Assistance continues
to intensify with two (three up to July 2015) resident advisors in Myanmar and five (up to October
2016) in the Bangkok-based TAOLAM alongside regular HQ-missions. Key TA priorities include
development of monetary and exchange rate policy tools, enhancing bank supervision,
strengthening tax policy and administration, enhancing budget preparation and execution,
strengthening macro policy analysis and developing macroeconomic statistics. The Fund also has a
wide-ranging training program for Myanmar.
There is strong collaboration between the WBG and IMF.


Macroeconomic policy advice to the authorities. WB and IMF regularly exchange views on
macroeconomic developments, carry out the joint Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA),
coordinate messages to the authorities, and coordinate TA, including on macroeconomic
monitoring and forecasting.



In the financial sector, the World Bank and IMF have been coordinating technical assistance
through regular information sharing based on an earlier joint note on the IMF-WB Financial
Sector TA Plan for Myanmar. World Bank TA has focused on strengthening the financial sector
legal and regulatory framework (including technical input on the now approved Financial
Institutions Law, and microfinance and insurance regulation and supervision); state-owned
bank reform, through completion of diagnostics of the four main state-owned banks;
regulatory framework for mobile financial services; and development of a Financial Sector
Development Strategy.



On fiscal management, the World Bank and the Fund have exchanged views on priorities for
the Second Public Expenditure Review; coordinating TA to the Large Taxpayers’ Office in its
efforts to introduce a risk-based audit system; coordinating TA to the Treasury Department
and the Myanmar Economic Bank on strengthening of the payment and settlement system;
and coordinating policy dialogue through participation in the PFM sector working group.



On structural reforms, during the process of the preparation of the Myanmar Investment Law,
the WBG has consulted frequently with the IMF on many provisions, in particular on issues
related to capital and current account transfers and taxation. The IMF provided written
comments on the first and second drafts of the Investment Law to the IFC and the
government.



On statistics, there has been good ongoing collaboration including joint IMF-ADB-WB
missions to Myanmar under the auspices of the National Strategy for the Development of
Statistics (NSDS) project to coordinate support and advice to the government. The IMF is
primarily providing TA to government finance statistics (Ministry of Finance), balance of
payments (Central Bank of Myanmar), prices (Central Statistical Organization), monetary
statistics/central bank balance sheets, and financial soundness indicators. The ADB is providing
TA on the SNA compilation framework. The World Bank is currently focusing support to
overall statistical strategy development, institutional reform, and poverty monitoring.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MYANMAR

Based on the above partnership, the World Bank and the Fund share a common view about
Myanmar’s macroeconomic and structural reform priorities. Important reform priorities include:


Promoting long-term growth and diversification. Modernizing Myanmar’s economy will
require removing impediments to growth by enhancing the business and investment climate,
encouraging financial sector development, and further liberalizing trade and foreign direct
investment. The government’s Framework for Economic and Social Reform would benefit from
coordination across government agencies, broader consultation with stakeholders, and
lessons from other countries’ experiences through substantial capacity building efforts.



Macroeconomic stability. Sustainable and inclusive growth will require macroeconomic
stability, which must be underpinned by a consistent macroeconomic policy mix.
Macroeconomic imbalances in Myanmar have increased over the past year as seen in rising
inflation and higher current account and fiscal deficits. These imbalances need to be
addressed by a tightening of monetary policy and a prudent fiscal policy, along with exchange
rate flexibility.



Foreign exchange policy. The authorities have come a long way in liberalizing the foreign
exchange regime, including the realignment of exchange rates and the introduction of a daily
FX auction in 2012. Foreign Exchange Management Regulations have been issued by the CBM.
Deepening the foreign exchange market will require strong commitment by the CBM to follow
the FX auction rules under the managed floating regime and further development of the
interbank foreign exchange market.



Monetary policy. Strengthening the CBM’s capacity to conduct monetary policy is a critical
prerequisite for macroeconomic management. To this end, the authorities need to ensure the
CBM is granted full budgetary autonomy with a strengthened balance sheet and improved
accounting systems. Continued attention to building tools and capacity for monetary policy is
required. Priorities include regularly conducting basic open market operations, enforcing
reserve requirements, and refining the reserve money forecasting and targeting framework.



Financial sector. Liberalization of the financial sector needs to be complemented with a
stronger regulatory and supervisory framework to maintain financial stability. Changes should
be implemented step by step, in line with the development of needed supervisory capability
and banks’ capacity. For instance, developing money markets and improving banks’ risk
management are necessary precursors to liberalization of lending rates and maturities. The
new Financial Institutions Law is expected to help set the sector on a modern footing. The next
step is the issuance of modernized prudential regulations, including on bank capital, loan
classification, connected lending, related parties, and large exposures. Other priorities include
developing a plan to reform the state-owned banks, developing plans for bank recovery and
resolution, establishing appropriate regulation of nonbank financial institutions, enhancing
financial inclusion, modernizing financial infrastructure including the payments system and a
credit bureau, and allowing banks to provide trade finance based on documentary collection.



Fiscal discipline and sustainability. Myanmar faces considerable fiscal pressures due to
significant spending needs on the one hand and a narrow revenue base on the other. Priorities

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

MYANMAR

include: (i) improved revenue collection, including through the system of tax self-assessment;
(ii) strengthened debt management through implementation of the newly adopted Public
Debt Law (2016); (iii) efficiency of expenditure, particularly related to public investments; and
(iv) ensuring fiscal discipline of State Economic Enterprises.


Prioritizing fiscal policies toward social and infrastructure spending. Continued increases
in budgetary allocations towards health and education are welcome. There is still room for
reallocating further resources to social sectors where spending levels remain relatively low.
Further room remains also for increased efficiency in spending on infrastructure which is
currently in a poor state and negatively affecting the business climate.



Strengthening statistical capacity. The government has outlined six priority areas for
statistical development: (i) modernizing the system of national accounts by adopting the
SNA 2008 framework and improving source data; (ii) strengthening the monitoring of poverty
and living conditions; (iii) revising and updating the Central Statistical Authority Act 1952; (iv)
developing and adopting a National Strategy for Development of Statistics; (v) establishing
inter-agency statistical clusters to improve coordination and collaboration on statistical issues;
(vi) strengthen capacity of Central Statistics Organization including through staffing and
budget allocations.
These are very sensible priorities, which will need to be implemented in a prioritized and
sequenced manner. In the short term the government aims to implement SNA 2008 (today
they broadly follow SNA 1968). This implies developing complementary data systems to
produce the minimum required data sets and constructing a Supply-Use Table (SUT). The ADB
is providing TA on the compilation framework/SUT and IMF is providing TA to selected
sectors.
WB is in discussions with the government on financial and technical support for a new
household survey. Besides information on poverty and household living conditions, a new
household survey will be an important source of data on the household final consumption for
the SUT.



Private Sector Development. To enhance investment (especially FDI) reforms are needed to
streamline procedures around funds transfers, including the inflow and repatriate of profits
and capital. The Investment Law ensures the rights for funds transfer, but there is uncertainty
in regard to the procedures and time required for funds transfers to be approved by the CBM.
The teams are committed to continue their close cooperation going forward. The table
below details the specific activities planned by the two country teams over the period
November 2016–October 2017.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP1
(November 2016)
Myanmar became a member of the World Bank in 1952, IFC in 1956, IDA in 1962, and MIGA in 2013.
By 1987, the Bank’s total portfolio amounted to US$804 million equivalent, of which
US$752.8 million equivalent had been disbursed. New lending ceased after 1987. The last formal
Consultative Group meeting was held in January 1986 in Tokyo, chaired by the World Bank.
Myanmar went into arrears with the World Bank in January 1998 and subsequently into nonaccrual
status in September 1998. All credits that had been approved but which had not fully disbursed
were cancelled and Myanmar was not eligible for new loans. The World Bank’s engagement with
Myanmar became limited to monitoring economic and social developments in the country.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MYANMAR

Relations between Myanmar and the World Bank were recently normalized. The World Bank
provided a US$80 million grant in 2012 for a Community Driven Development Project. The
Government of Myanmar cleared the full amount of its arrears to the World Bank in January 2013, in
the amount of US$420 million through a bridge loan from the Government of Japan. The World
Bank resumed lending to support Myanmar’s foreign exchange needs, including those associated
with IDA arrears clearance.
The World Bank opened its first ever country office in Myanmar on August 1, 2012. Initial
engagement with Myanmar was guided by an Interim Strategy Note (FY13–14). This was followed by
a Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) that identified priorities for accelerating progress towards the
twin goals that the WBG has committed to helping attain in its member countries: ending poverty
and boosting shared prosperity.
The SCD provided the basis for a Country Partnership Framework (CPF), the first full country strategy
for Myanmar since 1984. The CPF program, which runs from FY2015 to FY2017, has three areas of
focus: reducing rural poverty; investing in people and effective institutions for people; and
supporting a dynamic private sector to create jobs.
Myanmar’s IDA 17 allocation is US$1.6 billion. The CPF identifies an indicative program based on this
amount, with significant frontloading. In addition, IFC expects to provide up to US$1 billion in
investments over the CPF period and US$20 million in technical assistance. MIGA will provide
insurance against political risks based on demand by private investors.
Since the approval of the pre-arrears grant to finance a National Community Driven Development
Project, ten IDA lending projects have been approved by the Executive Board of Directors in
agriculture, additional financing for the community driven development project, river basin
management, electricity, telecommunications, public financial management, health, education, and
agriculture. IFC has made investments in infrastructure, microfinance, hospitality and banking,
There are several WB lending projects in the pipeline for delivery within the next 12 months: on
financial inclusion, health financing, and policy-based lending. IFC is developing its pipeline of
investments in several sectors. Apart from lending programs, the World Bank has significantly scaled
up its analytical and advisory services.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK2
(November 2016)
Myanmar joined the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) in 1973 and operations started the same year.
In 2012, as the international community resumed engagement with Myanmar as a result of
significant economic and political reforms, the AsDB developed a road map for resumption of
normal operations. The activities included initial assessments of the economy and of key sectors,

MYANMAR

provision of technical assistance, and development of an interim country partnership strategy
for 2012–2014.
AsDB’s interim country partnership strategy for 2012–2014 (extended to 2016) seeks to support the
government in achieving sustainable and inclusive growth. It focuses on (i) building human
resources and capacities (capacity building in ministries in core areas of AsDB involvement, and
education); (ii) promoting an enabling economic environment (macroeconomic and fiscal
management; and trade, investment and financial sector reform); and (iii) creating access and
connectivity (rural livelihoods and infrastructure development, especially energy and transport).
AsDB has mainstreamed the thematic areas of good governance, environmental sustainability,
private sector development, and regional cooperation and integration into its operations. AsDB will
focus on the crosscutting areas of knowledge and partnerships. The AsDB Country Operations
Business Plan 2014–2016 (finalized in November 2013), laid out an investment program covering
energy, transport (roads), agriculture and natural resources, and urban development.
In 2016, AsDB completed the analytical and consultative work for a full Country Partnership Strategy,
planned for the period 2017–2021, to be submitted for Board endorsement in early 2017. The
Country Partnership Strategy as well as the annual Country Operations Business Plan for 2017–2019
(finalized in October 2016) reflect a gradual shift towards increased sector focus, concentrating on
infrastructure (transport, energy, and urban development), education and training, and rural
development as priority activities. It will apply a long-term approach in the priority areas, and is
coordinated and aligned with evolving strategies and sector activities of other development
partners.
Myanmar cleared its arrears to AsDB in January 2013. The AsDB has so far provided 43 loans and
grants totaling US$1,532.4 million for 37 projects and one policy-based operation. Of these, two
loans amounting to US$6.6 million were from the AsDB’s ordinary capital resources (OCR) which
have already been pre-paid, 34 loans were from concessional Asian Development Fund resources,
and 7 were grant-financed. The AsDB has so far provided technical assistance (TA) totaling
US$67.8 million for 97 projects. Of these 71 TA projects, 54 were approved since AsDB reengaged
with Myanmar in 2012.
With resumption of its engagement with the international community, Myanmar is an increasingly
active participant in the Greater Mekong Subregion Economic Cooperation Program and the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). AsDB coordinates closely with the IMF, the World
Bank, the UNDP, and other development partners and is actively engaged in various sector and
thematic working groups formed by the government for aid coordination purposes.
The largest share of AsDB assistance has been provided to support public sector management,
followed by development of the agricultural sector (largely prior to 1988). The sector composition of
AsDB accumulated lending to Myanmar is shown below:

STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of December 15, 2016
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance. Data are not provided in a
timely manner, and official and independent estimates of key macroeconomic variables differ widely.
National Accounts: Myanmar’s national accounts follow the 1968 System of National Accounts. National accounts
data are only available on an annual basis. Quarterly data are also compiled, but are not disseminated. Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) estimates are compiled at current and constant prices by production and expenditure
approaches, with 2010/2011 as base year. Significant discrepancies exist between the two approaches. GDP is
estimated at producer prices, instead of the internationally recommended market prices. The quality of the GDP
measures is hampered by inadequate source data and the lack of relevant price indexes, such as the producer price
index. National accounts estimates do not completely account for informal sector activity. Estimates of some
economic activities, particularly in agriculture, construction, and public administration, need major improvement.
Resource constraints at the Planning Department and the Central Statistical Organization, along with the lack of
interagency coordination and a clear delineation of responsibilities, limit the conduct of surveys and other data
collection. Technical assistance (TA) is being provided by Asian Development Bank (AsDB) and United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) to improve the national accounts and to implement the 2008 SNA.
Price Statistics: The IMF Statistics Department (STA) has been providing TA to develop a new CPI since
March 2013. The new CPI covering the whole country was released in August 2016. The new CPI is based on
the 2012 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES), and is according to international standards and best
practices. The new index includes 274 products and services, compared to 158 in the previous one.
Government Finance Statistics: There is no comprehensive monthly or quarterly compilation of fiscal data.
Monthly cash-based budget execution data are available in local language, but are not published. Annual
comprehensive data are compiled with delays of up to 12 months after the end of the reference year. In addition,
some transactions of state economic enterprises are recorded partly on an accrual and partly on a cash basis. Fiscal
and monetary data are not consistent. Budget estimates and actual expenditures tend to differ by wide margins. In
addition, recording of debt statistics is not comprehensive.
Myanmar is participating in a three-year program funded by the government of Japan designed to improve
government finance statistics in the Asia and Pacific Region. In addition, a long-term GFS advisor is currently
stationed at the IMF's Technical Assistance Office for the Lao PDR and the Republic of the Union of Myanmar
(TAOLAM) in Bangkok, Thailand, also funded by the government of Japan, but under a separate program. Regular
TA visits to the country are undertaken by the GFS Advisor.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: The monetary survey compiled by the Central Bank of Myanmar (CBM) covers
the central bank and all commercial banks (public and private). Reporting of monetary data in the Standardized
Report Forms, which accord with the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual classification principles, was
established in January 2012. Nine finance companies and a multiple of deposit taking microfinance institutions
have been established in 2013–14. In addition, nine foreign bank branches commenced their operations in 2015
and were included in the monetary statistics. The quality of monetary statistics could be further improved by: (i)

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MYANMAR

expanding the coverage of institutions; (ii) monitoring the consistency of the reciprocal/interbank accounts that
show positions between the CBM and the commercial banks; and initiating data review and resolution of large
inconsistencies; (iii) using electronic means to capture and share data to minimize mistakes; and (iv) in due course,
adopting market or fair value-based valuation of financial instruments.
Financial sector surveillance: The authorities do not provide financial soundness indicators (FSI) to STA for
dissemination, but compilation program for the Financial Soundness Indicators is currently under development,
which will be critical for effective surveillance of the financial sector. The CBM is currently implementing regulatory
prudential measures, which will improve the FSI data quality.
External sector statistics: The balance of payments (BOP) and international investment position (IIP) are compiled
on the basis of the sixth edition of the IMF Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual
(BPM6) since 2015 and quarterly figures are reported to STA. Myanmar has not yet participated in the Coordinated
Direct Investment Survey (CDIS). Although recent revisions have resulted in more accurate classifications of
transactions and positions, the reliability of the balance of payments and IIP remains broadly impacted by coverage
gaps in most components of (e.g., some services, direct investment assets, portfolio investment assets and
liabilities, and other investment assets). The revaluation of the national currency in April 2012 resulted in a large
break in the balance of payments and IIP series.
A STA three-year project on the Improvement of External Sector Statistics in Lao P.D.R. and Myanmar started in
March 2014. Under the project, TA is provided by the external sector statistics resident advisor stationed at the
TAOLAM in Bangkok, Thailand.

II. Data Standards and Quality
Myanmar began participating in the IMF’s General
Data Dissemination System (GDDS) in
November 2013, which was superseded by the
enhanced GDDS (e-GDDS) in 2015.
A Fund mission on e-GDDS to Myanmar in early
2016 under a Japan government-funded project for
enhancing data dissemination in the Asia and Pacific
region facilitated the authorities’ progress in
implementing the e-GDDS.

No data ROSC is available.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By Markus Rodlauer and
Steven Barnett (IMF), and John Panzer (IDA)

Prepared By
International Monetary Fund
International Development Association

Myanmar is assessed to remain at low risk of debt distress.123 Under the baseline
scenario, public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt burden indicators are
projected to remain below their indicative thresholds. Similarly, total public debt is also
projected to remain below the benchmark in the baseline, though stress tests lead to
breaches in the event of an extreme shock, fiscal slippages and a severe natural disaster.
These vulnerabilities call for close monitoring, in particular because there is potential for
both domestic and external downside risks (such as uncertain growth in China and
weak natural gas prices) to materialize that may adversely affect the level of debt.
Therefore, to keep Myanmar at low risk of debt distress, the authorities need gradually
to consolidate the fiscal position while continuing to strengthen economic resilience,
including by building up policy buffers and broadening the productive base. Use of
nonconcessional borrowing should be limited to high-return projects.

1

External public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt and public domestic debt dynamics are assessed using
the LIC DSA framework, which recognizes that better policies and institutions allow countries to manage
higher levels of debt, and thus the threshold levels are policy dependent. The quality of a country’s policies
and institutions are normally measured by the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment
(CPIA). The most conservative thresholds are applied for the purposes of this DSA based on the average CPIA
index of the last two years which indicate a weak rating for Myanmar.
2
3

The DSA was jointly prepared by the IMF and the World Bank staffs.

This risk rating is unchanged from the previous DSA, published in September 2015, as a part of the staff
report for the 2015 Article IV consultation with Myanmar (SR/15/267)
http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=43293.0

MYANMAR

BACKGROUND
1.
The external and public debt sustainability analyses are based on the standard LIC DSA
framework. The DSA framework presents the projected path of Myanmar’s external and public sector debt
burden indicators, and draws conclusions on the sustainability of debt.
2.
The underlying macroeconomic assumptions remain broadly unchanged from the last DSA
but updates have been made taking into account several changes in both the external and domestic
environment since the last Article IV consultation. Myanmar is undergoing a major economic transition,
and its long-term economic prospects are favorable on account of continued reform and external support.
Main macroeconomic assumptions:


Growth remained robust in 2015/16 at about 7.3 percent, but is expected to soften in 2016/2017 as a
result of a number of transitory factors since the new government took office in April 2016. Over the
medium term, growth is expected to converge to its estimated potential rate of 7-8 percent, as private
investments begin to accelerate and production in the special economic zones gradually rises. Over the
longer term, growth will slow down to somewhat below 7 percent (see Table 1), as Myanmar’s income
levels rise.



Inflation (GDP deflator, percent change y/y) is projected to fall slowly and average around 7.2 percent
over the medium term (2021/22). Long-term inflation is expected to settle at around 5 percent in line
with staff’s recommended inflation objective.



The fiscal deficit widened in 2015/2016 to 4.1 percent of GDP, and is expected to remain above
4 percent in 2016/2017, reflecting slowdown in revenue growth and in part an expected increase in
expenditure on key infrastructure and social services. The staff advises the authorities to keep the fiscal
deficit at no more than 4.5 percent of GDP in the medium term and gradually reducing the deficit
below that level over the longer term in line with slower GDP growth.



The current account deficit is expected to remain relatively high over the medium term at between
6-7 percent, reflecting Myanmar’s strong investment and development needs, but is expected to fall
over time as export capacity strengthens.

3.
Reliance on external concessional financing is expected to rise over the medium term,
similar to the previous DSA. While bilateral creditors (Japan and China) remain the biggest lenders to
Myanmar (see Table 2), the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank are gradually stepping up
concessional financing to Myanmar. In the medium term, external debt commitments from multilaterals
and other concessional lenders (i.e., JICA) are expected to rise,4 although lags in disbursements may occur
given weak project implementation capacity. Reliance on nonconcessional borrowing is expected to
decline over the medium term, as concessional financing from multilateral and bilateral lenders becomes
more readily available. However, we assume that the share of nonconcessional borrowing in the total
external borrowing will gradually increase over the long term as Myanmar becomes more developed and
able to access financial markets.

DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
4.
Total external public and publicly guaranteed debt increased in 2015 for the first time in
10 years, to 15.9 percent of GDP from 13.9 percent a year earlier. Total public debt also increased in
2015 to 34.1 percent of GDP from 29.2 percent in 2014, largely as a result of a large increase in the central
bank financing of the widened fiscal deficit, which has raised concerns about the inflationary impact of
budget financing and underscores the importance of increasing market financing.
5.
The new government has taken steps to ensure continued debt sustainability by passing a
new Public Debt Management Law (PDML) and starting preparation of a comprehensive
Medium-Term Fiscal Framework. The government continued its efforts in shifting from short-term
towards medium-term financing through issuance of Treasury Bonds. Additionally, for 2016/17 the
authorities set a cap of 40 percent for CBM financing of the total public deficit, with gradual declines
thereafter. These are steps in the right direction and should help to keep public debt on a sustainable path
in the future. Nevertheless, a more ambitious pace of phase out of CBM financing, replaced by domestic
debt issuance, would help more forcefully address inflationary pressures.

6.
Public and publically guaranteed external debt is projected to remain below the indicative
thresholds throughout the projection period. Debt indicators also remain below the various thresholds
under the baseline assumptions and the standard and alternative stress tests.5 Nevertheless, some
indicators, such as the PV of debt-to-GDP and PV of debt-to-export ratios, are relatively sensitive to the
exports shock, the depreciation shock, and the combination of shocks. For example, the exports shock (due
to further drop in gas prices) causes a significant rise in the debt-to-exports ratio, as shown in Figure 1a,
chart c. Given Myanmar’s large current account deficit and vulnerabilities to exogenous shocks, such as
commodity price volatility and natural disasters, the authorities need to pursue prudent macroeconomic
policies and build up policy buffers, particularly foreign reserves. Over the long run, economic
diversification will be important, with improvements in productivity and export competitiveness in
manufacturing and agriculture. Building on the new Investment Law, further efforts will be needed to
attract FDI to fund investment projects.
7.
Total public sector debt will also remain below the indicative benchmark under the baseline
scenario, but it is vulnerable to shocks. In the baseline, the PV of total public debt as a percentage of
GDP stays below the indicative benchmark throughout the projection period. However, the standard stress
tests show that the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio could breach the benchmark toward the end of the projection
period if shocks result in a significant decline in GDP growth and if fiscal slippages result in a failure in
gradual fiscal consolidation.6
8.
Myanmar is prone to large scale weather related natural disasters and is one of the
most vulnerable countries among developing Asian countries (see selected issues paper on
“Macro-Fiscal Risks: The Challenge of Climate Related Disasters”). In light of this risk, an alternative
stress test is conducted, a scenario whereby a severe natural disaster of a magnitude similar to the
impact of Cyclone Nargis in 2008 is assumed to happen in fiscal year 2017/2018 (almost ten years
after). 7 This stress test leads the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio to breach the benchmark threshold in the long
run after 2029/2030. To manage these risks, Myanmar needs to continue with structural reforms to improve
its growth potential and resilience. A continued commitment to prudent fiscal policy is essential.

The Asian Development Bank is expected to approve a total of US$3 billion in sovereign and non-sovereign loans
over 2013–2018. The World Bank is expected to commit about US$1 billion in 2016–2018. In November 2015, the
Prime Minister of Japan announced that Japan will commit an ¥800 billion (US$7.7 billion) package, which will
comprise funding from both the public (through Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)) and private sectors
to be spread over five years.
4

The typical historical scenario is not shown in this analysis. In the case of Myanmar, the historical scenario would
imply an unlikely return to pre-reform policies: low noninterest current account deficits (consistent with binding
international sanctions) and sustained real exchange rate pressures.
5

6 For

the PV of total public debt to GDP ratio, the most extreme shock is the growth shock which causes a breach in
the indicative benchmark in 2025/26, while fixing the primary balance leads to a breach in 2029/30.
7 The

alternative cyclone scenario is based on the following assumptions: projected GDP growth is reduced by
two-thirds in 2017 and 2018; the nominal exchange rate depreciates by 35 percent in 2017-2019; inflation is
expected to double in 2017 and 2018; following historical experience both government revenue and expenditures are
adjusted downward; financial aid and concessional finance is expected to increase.

STAFF ASSESSMENT
9.
Myanmar is assessed to remain at low risk of debt distress. Public and publicly guaranteed
(PPG) external debt is generally resilient to shocks under standard and alternative stress tests, although it is
sensitive to export and exchange rate depreciation shocks. Continuation of export-market and exchange
rate risks should be monitored carefully, given high uncertainty over growth in China and commodity price
outlook. Downside realization of these risks, especially if combined with other risks, could shift risk ratings
higher in a relatively short period of time. Total public debt is projected to stay below the benchmark, but it
is vulnerable to growth shocks and fiscal slippages. These findings suggest that Myanmar needs to
strengthen its economic resilience, including through broadening its production and export base and
building up policy buffers such as higher foreign reserves. Moreover, given the sharp rise in the fiscal deficit
in 2015/16 and potential shocks including natural disasters, gradual fiscal consolidation and a long-term
commitment to fiscal prudence are critical to preserving debt sustainability.

Authorities’ Views
10.
The authorities broadly agreed with these conclusions and the analysis. They planned to take
a conservative approach to external borrowing that balances development needs with long-term fiscal
sustainability. They shared staff’s view that nonconcessional external borrowing should be used only to
finance high-return projects in priority sectors, at levels that are in line with the new PDML and consistent
with low risk of debt distress. The authorities were committed to improving the medium-term fiscal
framework, including by developing a medium-term debt management strategy.

2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Statement by IMF Staff Representative on Myanmar
January 25, 2017
The information below has become available following the issuance of the staff report
(SM/17/1). It does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
In December 2016, the parliament passed a supplementary budget for FY 2016/17
that would increase the overall fiscal deficit by 0.7 percent of GDP, but full budget
implementation is unlikely (Text Table 1). The supplementary budget would increase the
overall fiscal deficit to 5.3 percent of GDP from 4.6 percent for FY 2016/17 if fully implemented,
making the fiscal policy stance more expansionary than envisaged. However, full budget
implementation is considered unlikely, given historical under-execution of budgeted
expenditures (by 2 percent of GDP on average for the past 5 years). Staff therefore does not
expect the supplementary budget to have a major impact on the baseline assessment of the
Myanmar economy.
2.
The additional spending is mostly in the areas of infrastructure (including
transportation), social services, and security. Detailed information on the supplementary
budget is not yet available, but according to the available data the supplementary budget
included 1.5 percent of GDP of spending, offset by 0.5 percent of under-executed spending for a
net spending increase of 1.0 percent of GDP. Budgeted revenues were increased by 0.3 percent
of GDP, leading to an additional financing need of 0.7 percent of GDP (0.5 percent for domestic
financing and 0.2 for external financing).

Statement by Marzunisham Omar, Executive Director for Myanmar
and Ms. May Toe Win, Advisor to the Executive Director
January 25, 2017
Introduction
1.
On behalf of the Myanmar authorities, we thank staff and management for the Fund’s
active engagement with Myanmar, including the constructive policy discussions that took place
in Yangon and Nay Pyi Taw from October 14 to 28, 2016.
The staff report reflects a good account of these discussions. The authorities appreciate staff’s
policy advice to address macroeconomic imbalances, including keeping the fiscal deficit in
check, tightening monetary policy in light of growing inflationary pressures, allowing greater
exchange rate flexibility, strengthening financial sector stability, and accelerating structural
reforms to lay the foundation for more resilient and inclusive growth. The authorities broadly
concur with the assessment and would take the recommendations into consideration in
formulating future policies.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
2.
After experiencing a rapid expansion of 7.3 percent in FY12015/16, economic activity
softened in the first half of FY2016/17 due to weak external demand, low commodity prices and
sluggish growth in the construction and investment sectors. Nevertheless, economic activity is
expected to pick-up over the remainder of FY2016/17 and into FY2017/18 against the backdrop
of the new government’s policies that are expected to boost investor confidence. Under the
National Development Strategy, medium-term growth is projected to average 8.2 percent
annually in the next 5 years, underpinned by improved macroeconomic management, increased
natural gas production and exports, and stronger performance in the non-gas sectors as the
economy opens up to foreign investment.
3.
Inflation declined to 6.3 percent in August and is projected to average at 7 percent in
FY2016/17 primarily on account of money supply growth. The current account deficit widened
to 5.2 percent of GDP in FY2015/16 as a result of lower natural gas exports and continued strong
import growth. The Central Bank of Myanmar’s (CBM) foreign reserves was lower by about
US$290 million due mainly to a decline in FDI inflows amidst uncertainty during the political
transition. The Kyat depreciated by about 17 percent against the U.S. dollar in nominal terms
over the course of the fiscal year, but appreciated in real effective terms on account of high
inflation.

1

The fiscal year (FY) starts on April 1 and ends on March 31.

2
4.
The authorities consider the risks to growth to be more balanced. In particular, as
uncertainties associated with the political transition subside and the new government’s policies to
promote private investment start to bear fruit, upside risks to growth could materialize. On the
external front, uncertainty over commodity prices and the rebalancing of the Chinese economy
continue to pose downside risks to growth. Weak natural gas prices are weighing on export and
government revenues while natural disasters remain a significant risk to the economy, as
demonstrated by the massive floods in 2015 and the earthquake earlier in 2016. The authorities
remain vigilant of the downside risks and will continue to undertake measures and reforms to
enhance macro-financial stability and ensure economic resilience.
Fiscal Policy
5.
After a sharp increase in the fiscal deficit to 4.1 percent of GDP in FY2015/16, the
authorities plan to maintain the deficit at around 4.5 percent of GDP over the medium term,
which in staff view would be consistent with keeping Myanmar at low risk of debt distress while
providing fiscal space to respond to shocks (including from frequent natural disasters) and
meeting the large development needs.
6.
Keeping the deficit in check is essential to maintain long-term debt sustainability and
anchor inflation and exchange rate expectations. Therefore, Myanmar remains committed to the
implementation of fiscal reforms, particularly tax and custom administration and tax policy
reforms aimed at strengthening domestic revenue mobilization. Notable progress has been made
on improving revenue administration, including the establishment of the large taxpayer office.
The authorities are working closely with the Fund and other development partners to continue
deepening the fiscal reforms, including by moving to Phase II of the revenue reform agenda.
They also recognize the need to ensure consistency and clarity of tax legislation and to pass the
Tax Administration Procedure Law, which is currently in drafting stage, in order to provide a
stable and transparent legal basis for tax collection.
7.
On expenditure management, the authorities will continue to prioritize expenditure on
critical infrastructure and social services while improving efficiency, and containing fiscal risks especially those emerging from State Economic Enterprises (SEEs), State-owned Banks (SOBs)
and public-private partnerships (PPPs). Thus, they are developing the groundwork for the Public
Financial Management Law while updating the Financial Rules and Regulations in the near term.
The authorities, with the assistance of development partners, are also in the process of
formulating reform strategies to improve SEE performance.
8.
The authorities have agreed to switch to the GFS2 definition of fiscal deficit as soon as
practicable, which would increase transparency and boost confidence of the business community
and development partners in the government’s public financial management.

9.
While public debt remains sustainable with the debt sustainability analysis showing a low
risk of debt distress, the authorities are determined to continue improving the medium-term fiscal
framework, particularly by developing a medium-term debt management strategy.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
10.
Myanmar has made important improvements to the monetary policy framework and
managed float exchange rate system in the last several years. These reforms include the
realignment of the reference rate with parallel market exchange rates in 2015, the conduct of
deposit auctions to mop up liquidity and the introduction of treasury bill (T-Bill) auctions. The
deposit auction, which was introduced in September 2012, facilitated market-driven interest rate
determination and more terms of deposits with greater participation by commercial banks and
greater flexibility for the CBM to target specific types of banks in the deposit auctions. In
addition, the reserve requirements for banks, introduced in April 2015, have been fully complied
with since October 2016.
11.
The CBM continues to tighten monetary conditions to prevent further increases in
macroeconomic imbalances and welcome staff’s recommendation to consider adopting a
medium-term inflation objective of around 5 percent to anchor inflation expectations and guide
its reserve money targeting.
12.
A key measure to control inflation is the phasing out of central bank financing of the
fiscal deficit. For the first time, the authorities will limit the central bank deficit financing to 40
percent of domestic financing in FY2016/17. This limit will be reduced gradually over the
medium term to ensure the potential increase in cost to the budget and any unintended crowding
out effects on private sector credit flows are manageable.
13.
To facilitate the phasing out of central bank deficit financing, T-bill and Treasury Bond
(T-bond) auctions were introduced in January 2015 and September 2016 respectively. Progress
has been made with the T-bill auctions with market-determined interest rates and extended T-bill
maturities. Foreign banks have been allowed to purchase government securities, which will also
help to promote the development of the market.
14.
Myanmar maintains and remains committed to a managed float exchange rate regime.
Kyat depreciated by 17% against the USD between mid-2015 to end-Nov 2016, which is
substantial and underscores that the exchange rate is flexible. In managing the exchange rate, the
authorities need to strike a careful balance - excessive depreciation will further exacerbate
inflation and could also affect confidence. Rather, the appreciation of real exchange rate is due to
high inflation and thus, the measures by the CBM to tighten monetary conditions and reduce
CBM financing of fiscal deficit. At the same time, the authorities agree that a more flexible
reference rate setting mechanism is needed. In this context, the authorities agree on the options
presented by staff in setting the reference rate, and requested Fund TA to study possible

4
realignment between the auction rate and parallel market rate based on market transactions as
advised by staff.
Financial Stability
15.
Notable progress has been achieved in strengthening financial stability. The Financial
Institutions Law (FIL) has been enacted and bank regulation and supervision has been
strengthened, including major advances made in full scope bank examinations, issuance of
Mobile Financial Services Regulation and publication of IMF financial soundness indicators.
16.
However, in view of the rapid credit growth due mainly to the large demand for credit by
productive sectors and still-weak capital levels in some banks, the authorities are committed to
further strengthening the financial supervision and regulatory framework. The CBM targets to
issue and enforce prudential regulations by end-March 2017, as well as enforcing the FIL,
completing full-scope examinations of all banks, and requiring banks to have capital and
liquidity recovery plans to meet the new regulatory requirements. In this connection, the
authorities agree with staff on the need to strengthen the capacity, including by having more
human resource at the CBM, to develop plans for bank recovery and resolution to enable the
CBM to deal with weak banks using its new FIL powers and to develop lender-of-last-resort
capabilities. The authorities’ welcome staff advice to carefully sequence higher lending rates
under the FIL, accelerate reforms of SOBs and deepen the money and foreign exchange markets.
Myanmar looks forward to further Fund support in the development of the interbank money
market and contingency planning for bank recovery and resolution.
17.
Achieving resilient and inclusive growth requires continued reforms to the financial
sector to improve financial intermediation and inclusion. In this regard, the authorities are
implementing measures to expand the branch network of the banking system, encourage
microfinance, and roll-out innovations in ATMs, point-of-sale systems and mobile banking. The
CBM issued the Mobile Financial Services Regulation in March 2016 which now allows the
participation of mobile network operators in mobile money market and mobile payments. In
addition, the payment and settlement systems will be further enhanced with the establishment of
the CBM Net system.
18.
Important steps have been taken to further strengthen the AML/CFT framework with the
passage of the Anti-Money Laundering Law and the Counter Terrorism Law, including its
accompanying regulations since 2015 as well as a Risk Management Guidance Note and the
updated risk based customer due diligence Directive for the compliance of financial institutions.
As a result, the FATF removed Myanmar from the list of countries under the ICRG process in
June 2016. A National Risk Assessment (NRA) on ML/TF is being conducted with the
assistance of the IMF, and the NRA Report is expected to be issued in mid-2017.

5
Structural Reforms to Achieve Resilient and Inclusive Growth
19.
After a smooth political transition in April 2016, the new government’s economic
priorities are focused on implementing sound macroeconomic policies, enhancing human capital,
developing the essential economic infrastructure as well as the agriculture and industry sectors,
and promoting balanced economic development across the states and regions in the country. A
