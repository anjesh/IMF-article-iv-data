IMF Executive Board Concludes 2017 Article IV Consultation with Turkey
On January 11, 2017, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Turkey.1
Following a strong performance in 2015, growth has slowed. The July failed coup attempt
heightened the spectrum of political uncertainty, and Russian sanctions have also negatively
affected confidence. Growth remains consumption-driven. Investment is weak amid heightened
uncertainty and a sharp deceleration of credit growth. Inflation has moderated but is still well
above target. The current account deficit remains sizeable, as the decline in tourism offsets
savings from low energy prices. Progress on structural reforms has been slow.
Fiscal policy turned expansionary in 2016. Higher government spending is driven by an increase
in the minimum wage and related subsidies, hiring in the education and health sectors, as well as
higher security outlays. The government granted a number of temporary tax
reductions/exemptions and expanded investment incentives during the second half of the year to
revive growth.
The central bank of Turkey (CBRT) eased monetary conditions, by cutting the overnight lending
rate by 250 basis points in the process of narrowing the interest rate corridor between March and
September 2016. After a sharp depreciation of the Lira in November, the CBRT raised the repo
rate to 8 percent and partly withdrew the liquidity provided to banks in the wake of the failed
coup attempt.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
Bank capital levels remain high, although some buffers are decreasing. Higher profits boosted
capital adequacy, reflecting in part lower overnight borrowing costs and relaxation of prudential
norms. Non-performing loans are increasing from a low level that partly reflects accommodating
rules for loan restructuring. Credit growth slowed markedly in 2016, due to both demand and
supply factors. Progress in strengthening the financial stability framework was assessed in detail
during this Article IV consultation as part of the IMF’s Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP), which analyzes financial sector health and associated policies. The FSAP’s findings are
summarized in the accompanying Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA).
Growth is projected to be below potential in 2016–17. The political focus on transitioning to a
presidential system; renewed questions over the future of the EU-Turkey relations; and tense
security situation in the South-East and conflicts in neighboring countries are expected to
prolong the uncertainty, keeping domestic demand subdued. Fiscal stimulus and the expected
completion of the gradual lifting of Russian sanctions are expected to support growth. Over the
medium-term, growth is projected to firm around 3.5 percent. Inflation is expected to stay above
target and the current account deficit to remain sizeable.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the Turkish economy’s resilience in the face of severe and
increasing challenges and the authorities’ efforts to avoid an excessive slowdown in the near
term. At the same time, Directors cautioned that the economy faces considerable downside
risks—with high inflation, external imbalances, and substantial reliance on external financing
continuing to generate vulnerabilities—while dealing with complex geopolitical and security
challenges. They underscored the overarching priority of rebalancing the economy through
policies aimed at increasing domestic savings and raising potential growth, while ensuring
strong and credible public institutions and policy frameworks that are clearly communicated.
Most Directors supported a near-term moderate fiscal expansion to address cyclical
developments, given the current available fiscal space. However, Directors advised that a tighter
fiscal stance is required in the medium term to reduce external imbalances and lower inflation.
They encouraged the authorities to strengthen the fiscal risk management framework, given that
contingent liabilities are increasing, in particular due to a continued expansion in
infrastructure-related PPPs.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ steps to simplify the monetary policy framework.
Continued efforts in this area would further improve communications and enhance monetary

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

policy transmission and credibility. Directors emphasized that the authorities should remain
vigilant and tighten monetary policy to address sharp lira depreciation, contain high and rising
inflation, and counteract intensifying external pressures. Directors also recommended rebuilding
international reserve buffers as conditions permit.
Directors welcomed that the banking sector remains well capitalized, and encouraged continued
vigilance in light of a deterioration in asset quality. Directors cautioned that banks face
substantially higher credit risks, and called for further strengthening of supervision and bank
governance. Directors recommended that macroprudential policy should be strengthened,
focusing on foreign exchange and other systemic risks, and not be used for demand
management. They welcomed the FSAP’s findings and recommendations, and highlighted the
desirability of further strengthening the independence of financial sector supervisory authorities,
deepening and broadening the risk assessment nature of financial supervision and follow up, and
strengthening the role of the Financial Stability Committee to support more effective systemic
risk oversight and management.
Directors encouraged the authorities to intensify the pace of structural reforms to promote
economic rebalancing and boost productivity. They welcomed progress made to reform the
voluntary pension system, and urged continued efforts to increase domestic saving. Directors
also underscored the importance of improving the investment climate and labor market
competitiveness. They commended the authorities for hosting a large number of refugees and
for their efforts to integrate them into the labor market, while stressing the importance of
continued international assistance.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2017 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
December 20, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context: After robust growth through Q1 2016, the expansion has slowed. Growth is
projected at 2.7 percent in 2016 and 2.9 percent in 2017 with considerable downward
risks. Domestic consumption is the main growth driver, supported by a large increase in
public expenditure and a hike in the minimum wage. However, political uncertainty,
weakened corporate profitability, anemic credit growth, and a sharp fall in tourism have
taken a toll on investment and net exports. The monetary stance and macro prudential
measures were loosened, but credit growth continues to slow. A negative output gap is
opening, but sticky expectations are keeping inflation above target. External imbalances
persist: the current account deficit remains large and the NIIP is projected to become
more negative. External financing conditions were favorable in the first semester,
helping the rollover of large financing needs and supporting the Lira. However, political
uncertainty after the failed coup attempt and a less favorable external environment are
weakening the Lira and increasing the cost of external financing.
Policies: The overarching goals are twofold: (1) avoiding an excessive slowdown of the
economy; and (2) addressing external imbalances and reducing inflation. In 2017, some
discretionary fiscal measures should be used. In outer years, tightening is needed as
external imbalances and inflation remain high. The authorities should continue
simplifying the monetary framework, keeping a broadly neutral monetary policy stance.
Monetary tightening could be required to limit excessive Lira volatility and its spillovers
to inflation. The central bank should continue to accumulate foreign reserves to build
buffers, against the backdrop of a choppier external environment. Macroprudential
policies should focus squarely on ensuring the soundness of the financial system.
Structural reforms should focus on increasing private domestic savings, improving the
business climate, and reducing informality.

CONTEXT
1.
Turkey has a dynamic economy, but needs to
invigorate growth. Since the 2001 financial crisis,
strengthened macroeconomic policies have dramatically
improved socio-economic outcomes. Over the period,
real per capita income increased by 50 percent, the
incidence of poverty was more than halved, and life
expectancy increased by 5 years. Enrolment and
graduation rates increased significantly at all education
levels, while gender gaps narrowed. The transformation
into an industrial and service economy is ongoing, with
agriculture still accounting for over one fifth of total
employment. However, Turkey’s catch-up with advanced
economies has slowed since 2008, and progress has
increasingly diverged from the historic record of best
performers. Moreover, growth has been unbalanced, as it
has been accompanied by rising private sector and
external indebtedness, leading to increased private
balance-sheet stress.

percent of US per capita GDP) was similar to that of
Korea in 1987.

2.
Political and economic uncertainty have increased following the failed coup attempt in
July 2016. Since then, a state of emergency has been imposed. More than 140,000 public
employees, including one fifth of all judges and prosecutors and over one third of the staff of the
banking supervisory agency (BRSA) and some economic ministries, have been suspended or
dismissed. Around 40,000 people have been detained and over 4,000 companies and institutions
with assets of close to US$4 billion have been shut, or taken over by the state. A referendum that
would expand presidential powers is likely in 2017.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Following a strong performance in the preceding
year, growth slowed in 2016. In the first half of 2016, GDP
growth was 3.9 percent (year-on-year), but its
quarter-on-quarter pace decelerated sharply, despite the easing
of fiscal and monetary policies. Growth remains
consumption-driven, reflecting the boost to real disposable
incomes from the January minimum wage hike and low energy
prices. Investment is weak, on the back of heightened
uncertainty and a sharp deceleration of credit growth. The
external sector subtracted from growth, due to the surge in real
imports and fall in tourist arrivals. The latter has had a negative
effect on a range of sectors, especially for accommodation,
transportation, and food services (Box 1).

The central bank (CBRT) has eased monetary

interbank overnight lending rate. At end-November, the CBRT
raised the one-week repo and overnight lending rates after a
steep Lira depreciation. In the wake of the failed coup attempt,
the CBRT lowered reserve requirements, allowed greater use of
gold and foreign currency, and offered unlimited Lira liquidity

Bank capital levels remain high, although some buffers
are decreasing. Higher bank profits and the credit growth
slowdown boosted the system-wide Tier 1 CAR to 13.7 percent
(Table 6). However, part of the CAR improvement was due to a
relaxation of prudential norms that released provisions and lowered
regulatory risk weights on consumer loans. Regulatory changes
reduced the provisioning requirements for restructured loans in
the tourism and energy sectors, as well as consumer loans and
credit cards. A broader definition of impaired loans that includes
restructured credits shows a deterioration in asset quality,
especially in the household and SME sectors.1 Bank profitability
has increased, as the drop in domestic funding costs has not
been fully passed on to borrowers, and also due to cost saving
measures and one-off factors. Banks’ negative on-balance-sheet,
net open FX position decreased from minus 30 to minus
8 percent of regulatory capital as residents’ FX deposits declined
and the reliance on short term FX funding decreased.

spending was partially offset by higher tax and non-tax
revenues. Following the failed coup attempt, the government announced a number of temporary tax
reductions/exemptions partly offset by an increase in fuel excises. The current Medium Term
Program (MTP) envisions a widening of the 2016 general government deficit by around 2 percent of
GDP. The public debt is sustainable, but a combination of growth and contingent liability shocks
would lead to a substantial increase in the public debt to GDP ratio (Annex IV.)

11.
The current account deficit remains sizeable at over
4.5 percent of GDP. The positive contribution from low world oil
prices has been broadly offset by the weak tourism season and
lower export prices. Non-oil real imports surged in 2016: H1,
spurred by the pick-up in consumption and REER appreciation.
Turkey’s external position remains weaker than the level consistent
with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings. The
current account deficit is 1–4 percent higher than the estimated
norm, implying a REER overvaluation of 5–15 percent on average
in 2016 (Annex II).

sector have so far refinanced maturing debt in international
markets flush with global liquidity. As of 2016:Q3, the pace of external debt accumulation has
slowed, reflecting the weakening economy and domestic credit, but also increased investor
concerns. Sovereign rating downgrades contributed to a rise in the cost of external funding, with
interest rates on syndicated loans increasing by 25-40 basis points. Portfolio inflows turned positive
with a net inflow reaching US$8 billion in the first nine months of 2016, following a drought in 2015.
The positive trend reversed in 2016:Q4, with non-resident withdrawals of US$2.5 billion by
mid-November reflecting Moody’s cut of the sovereign rating to below-investment and the
November emerging markets rout.

13.
Turkey’s external debt is sustainable, but remains vulnerable to interest and exchange
rate risks. Turkey’s external debt of around 60 percent of GDP is vulnerable to valuation shocks
(Annex III). Debt service costs are sensitive to tightening of global liquidity conditions and changes
in investor sentiment, given the still large share of short-term liabilities and loans with variable
interest rates.
14.
Net international reserves (NIR) have increased from a low base. NIR (adjusted for
public sector FX deposits) increased to about US$33 billion by November 2016, as the CBRT
suspended FX auctions in April and reduced FX sales to state-owned energy companies. This,

alongside the issuance of government debt in foreign currency and CBRT measures to provide Lira
liquidity against FX collateral, contributed to the increase in gross international reserves (GIR) (Figure
2). The November CBRT measures in support of the weakening Lira pared some of the gains in GIR,
which hover slightly above 90 percent of the IMF’s reserves adequacy (ARA) metric.
15.
Turkish financial markets have underperformed other large emerging markets in 2016.
Markets sagged in the wake of the failed coup attempt, but Turkey was also among the countries
most affected by the sell-off of emerging market assets that started in November 2016 (Figure 5).

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
16.
Growth is projected to be below potential in 2016–18. Domestic political turmoil,
uncertain future of the EU-Turkey relations, tensions in the South-East regions, and military
involvement in neighboring countries are expected to weigh in on domestic demand. However,
population growth and rising wages will support consumption, while macroprudential loosening and
fiscal incentives will benefit investment.2 Bank credit to the private sector is expected to remain
subdued and, hence, not to be a significant factor in the growth recovery.3 Net exports are expected
to improve somewhat, as a result of the Lira depreciation, the domestic demand retrenchment, and
the expected lifting of Russian sanctions but security concerns are likely to hold back the full
recovery in tourist arrivals. Uncertainty and changing global financing conditions are expected keep
the cost of external borrowing elevated. As a result, short-term growth prospects have worsened
considerably. Over the medium-term, growth is projected to be at around 3.5 percent, unchanged
from previous estimates,4 but internal and external imbalances are expected to persist, with inflation
remaining well above target and external debt rising.
17.

On balance, the risks to the medium-term baseline are tilted to the downside (Annex I):



On the upside, increased trade with Iran and a stronger than expected recovery in the EU
could help reduce external imbalances. Prompt implementation of planned structural
reforms may yield better results earlier than currently envisaged.



Downside risks relate to the high exposure to FX risk of non-financial corporations,5 large
annual external financing needs against the backdrop of low net international reserves (NIR),
the sizeable short-term capital inflows, and the expected further widening of the negative

While the largest firms seem relatively resilient to both FX and interest rate shocks, the performance of second-tier
firms (between top 20–100 largest firms) is noticeably weaker given their weak starting positions and lack of hedges
against currency depreciation (Turkey 2016 FSSA). The consequent deterioration in corporate credit quality from
these second tier firms under the stress scenarios is rapid and significant.

NIIP. These weaknesses could exacerbate the negative effects of a possible increase in the
cost of external financing caused, for instance, by rapid interest rate increases by the U.S.
Federal Reserve or a generalized increase in global risk premia. Deleveraging could
accelerate, leading to a credit-income contraction cycle and ultimately to a recession. A
possible further deterioration in geopolitical relations could undermine investor confidence.

Authorities’ views
18.
The authorities believe growth will recover strongly in 2017. They attribute the
economic slowing primarily to the drop in tourism, which shaved more than 1 percentage point off
growth in 2016. However, thanks to a relaxation in macroprudential measures, a reduction in
domestic interest rates, and investment stimulus packages, consumption and investment is expected
to recover in 2017. Improved relations with Russia and growth in traditional trading partners will
help the recovery of tourism and exports. With the help of political stability and structural reforms,
they expect Turkey to perform strongly. The Medium-Term Program projects growth at 4.4 percent
in 2017 and 5.0 percent in 2018.

POLICY AGENDA
19.
The overarching goals are: (1) avoiding an excessive slowdown of the economy; and
(2) addressing external imbalances and reducing inflation. The growth slowdown and the Lira
depreciation have put pressure on non-financial corporations and could ultimately generate risks for
the financial sector. Avoiding an adverse loop between the slowing economy, large depreciation,
and private balance sheets is the immediate goal. Addressing the external imbalances remains the
main medium-term priority, requiring macro policies and structural reforms to increase private
saving and reduce dependence on external financing.
20.
These challenges call in the short run for a broadly neutral monetary stance—to the
extent consistent with orderly FX market conditions—and a moderately looser fiscal stance.
Monetary policy tightening could be required to prevent excessive Lira volatility in the short-run and
contain its spillovers to inflation. Use of some fiscal space could help cushion the impact of negative
shocks and possible tighter liquidity conditions on the economy. Financial sector policies should aim
at preserving financial stability via maintaining a robust macroprudential regime, including measures
to lower foreign exchange risk in the economy, and further strengthening supervision and bank
governance.

A. Monetary Policy
21.
Staff welcomed the simplification of the monetary framework. A framework in which
liquidity is provided at a policy rate would improve the transmission of monetary policy. Future steps
in this direction should aim at closing the gap between the average cost of CBRT funding and the
policy (one-week repo) rate and making the interest rate corridor symmetric around that rate, while
keeping the real cost of liquidity provision in positive territory. This would help better manage the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

TURKEY

variability of interest rates and liquidity certainty, and increase the clarity of the monetary policy
signal. The increase of the one-week repo rate at end-November helps achieve this objective.
22.
Staff advised maintaining the current monetary stance. Staff saw the current positive,
real CBRT funds rate as balancing the need to contain imbalances and provide a backstop to the
slowing economy. The monetary stance should be tightened if the recovery is stronger than
expected and/or inflation fails to decline to its target. A tighter monetary stance could be also
required to limit excessive Lira volatility and its inflationary spillovers. The enhanced provision of Lira
liquidity after the failed coup attempt was appropriate, but this extra liquidity should be gradually
withdrawn.
23.
Staff recommended increasing international reserves. Staff welcomed the suspension of
the regular foreign exchange auctions and reduced FX sales to state-owned enterprises. Conditional
on global liquidity conditions being favorable, staff advised a further increase of net international
reserves (NIR) through (partially) sterilized interventions communicated in advance to avoid market
disruptions, and by increasing the credit limit facility for the EXIM Bank. NIR would need to be
increased by about US$10 billion for GIR to reach 100 percent of the IMF’s ARA metric.

Authorities’ views
24.
The authorities re-affirmed their commitment to complete the simplification of the
monetary policy framework. They saw the timing of further steps in the process as being
dependent on inflation dynamics and external conditions. The authorities have also started a
gradual withdrawal of the extraordinary provision of Lira liquidity against FX collateral in the
aftermath of the failed coup attempt. While agreeing on the need to build reserves, they considered
the current conditions unsupportive of a rapid accumulation.

B. Fiscal Policy
25.
Moderate fiscal loosening in 2017 is appropriate, but a credible medium-term
consolidation plan is needed. The projected widening of the general government structural
primary balance by ½ percent of GDP in 2017 would support domestic demand, without
exacerbating external imbalances. Staff urged authorities to let automatic stabilizers work and
argued that an extension of the minimum wage subsidy at an appropriately lower level could be an
effective means of supporting growth and employment. Staff welcomed the planned increase in
public investment. However, staff cautioned that the announced investment incentives may not be
effective to achieve the desired effect, given the high level of uncertainty and elevated private debt
burden (Box 2). Tax incentives would have to be well-targeted and supported by macroeconomic
stability and rule of law to be effective. While broadly supportive of the authorities’ 2017
expenditure plan, staff considers the authorities’ 2017 revenue projections to be overly optimistic,
with the tax-to-GDP ratio projected to increase by 0.4 percent of GDP in 2017. Tax expenditures
remain an issue and revisions suggest they are in fact over 3 percent of GDP higher than previously
estimated. For 2018-19, the planned reduction of current transfers by 1 percent of GDP in 2018–19
is appropriate, but needs to be backed by specific measures to contain the wage bill, pension and
health care spending and limit the increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio in the medium term.

substantial rollover needs, call for prudence in using the fiscal space.
27.
Enhanced management of fiscal risks is warranted. Contingent liabilities are increasing,
due to continued reliance on PPPs for infrastructure investment. At the same time, the legal and
oversight framework for PPPs is fragmented. A growing share of fiscal risks falls outside the
Treasury’s established approval and monitoring system and is not public (Box 4). Staff urged
stronger central oversight, approval, and disclosure procedures for all public guarantees, backed by
a comprehensive PPP framework law. Staff viewed the newly announced investment incentives as
adding to existing fiscal risks, as in some cases they would involve the extension of purchase and
other guarantees. 6 The recently established sovereign wealth fund, to be funded by privatization
receipts and possible capital market financing, carries added potential for fiscal and financial risks.
Staff therefore recommended that the governance of the fund should be aligned with international
best practices, including published annual reports, audited financial statements, and a transparent
investment policy. Staff reiterated its recommendation to publish an explicit fiscal risk statement.

Authorities’ views
28.
The authorities believe that their policies appropriately address the need to stimulate
the economy while remaining fiscally responsible. They emphasized the relatively low level of
public debt and its composition as strengths, and reiterated their intention to maintain fiscal
discipline. The central government overall deficit is envisioned to remain below 2 percent of GDP
throughout the MTP horizon, which would ensure a declining trend in public debt. They believed
that the new incentive schemes would boost investment as they offer a wide spectrum of benefits to
the potential investors in a flexible manner.
29.
The authorities deem fiscal risks to be manageable. They also acknowledged the
desirability of expanding fiscal risk disclosure to entities beyond the Treasury, and strengthening
PPP governance. The authorities also reiterated their intention to align the sovereign wealth fund
with international best practices.

C. Financial Sector Policies
30.
Staff advised further strengthening of supervision and bank governance, building on
the enhanced legal framework for financial regulation. Banks face rising credit risks in the

downward phase of the economic cycle. The share of non-performing loans has increased in
consumer and more recently corporate loans. Restructuring of credits to sectors hit hardest by the
economic slowdown masks the extent of asset quality impairment. Drawing upon the findings of the
recent FSAP assessment (Box 5), staff urged authorities to evaluate and revise the definition of credit
classifications to bring them more in line with international norms and strengthen enforcement, and
to strengthen the supervisory processes and banks’ governance standards.
31.
Staff questioned the rationale behind the recent loosening of macroprudential
regulations for consumer loans. Macroprudential policies should focus squarely on ensuring the
soundness of the financial system—not on active domestic demand management. Staff argued that
the macroprudential loosening risks being counterproductive in the context of high private
indebtedness. Even if it is temporarily successful in spurring demand, it adds to existing financial
vulnerabilities that policies would need to address in the future.
32.
Staff argued that the macroprudential regime for corporate FX borrowing should aim
at lowering the foreign exchange risk in the economy. Specific measures in this area, drawn from
the recent FSAP assessment, are manifold: (i) quicker phase-in of reserve requirement measures
aimed at lengthening the maturity of banks’ external financing as well as the net stable funding
ratio; (ii) increasing the remuneration differential between Lira and FX reserves to further slow banks’
FX wholesale borrowing; (iii) increasing capital charges and/or provisioning on FX loans aimed at
internalizing the increased indirect credit risk associated with FX lending; (iv) bringing the prudential
treatment of FX-indexed lending in line with that of FX lending; and (v) introducing tax measures to
discourage NFCs from borrowing in FX, both domestically and externally.
33.
Turkey continues to make progress toward implementing international standards for
anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism. Staff encouraged the authorities
to implement the FSAP recommendations in the area (Box 5).

Authorities’ views
34.
The authorities see the loosening of macroprudential measures for consumer lending
as stabilizing domestic demand and thereby lowering financial sector risks. While aware of the
challenges stemming from the corporate sector’s elevated negative FX position, the authorities
maintain that relaxation in macroprudential measures will help recovery in credit growth, which has
been subdued for three years.

D. Contingency Planning
35.
Additional policy space should be used in case of a marked growth slowdown. Political
uncertainty could take a heavier toll, particularly if actions related to the private sector have the
effect of elevating counterparty risk. The weak business climate could further dampen anemic
private investment, and bring consumption growth to a standstill. Such dynamics could engender a
vicious macro-financial cycle of deleveraging, cuts in investment by over-indebted corporates, and

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TURKEY

ultimately income contraction.7 Staff argued that in such a situation some additional fiscal space
could be used and monetary policy could assign a bigger weight on the output gap than on the
overshooting of the inflation target; however, relaxation of macroprudential policy should not be
used for countercyclical purposes. The authorities should require prompt recapitalization if stress
tests show a capital shortfall.
36.
In case of large capital outflows—or, in extremis, a sudden stop—a tighter monetary
stance would be unavoidable. In disorderly market conditions, banks and corporates would have
difficulties rolling over external debt, and the renewal of FX hedges could become prohibitively
expensive. Banks would likely react by not rolling over corporates’ domestic FX loans, precisely at
the time when corporates would be under strain to repay them. In such a scenario, a recession
would be likely, and the Lira would be under pressure. Under such circumstances, staff argued that
the policy rate would need to be increased sharply to avoid a more damaging and disruptive
depreciation. Given that net international reserves are low, the scope for credible FX intervention is
limited. In the event of a recession, fiscal policy should be loosened, as public debt sustainability is
not an immediate concern. Still, corporate default and bank liquidity or solvency problems could
occur. In this regard, staff reiterated the recommendation to strengthen supervisory processes and
banks’ governance standards and emphasized the importance of putting in place of a robust
debt-restructuring framework.

Authorities’ views
37.
The authorities stressed that the economy has been resilient in the face of several
negative shocks. The low level of public debt and its composition, solid bank balance sheets,
flexibility of the real sector, and renewed political stability contribute to the stability of the economy.

E. Structural Reforms
38.
Restoring business confidence and improving the investment climate are key
priorities. This will require enhancing the predictability of the regulatory environment, while
ensuring adequate public institutional capacity in the wake of the failed coup attempt. The
investment climate should be further enhanced by simplifying regulations and administrative
procedures for starting a business, as well as increasing the efficiency of the legal system.
39.
There was agreement on the need to make labor markets more flexible, and on raising
competitiveness. Staff welcomed recent legislative amendments aimed at liberalizing fixed-term
contracts and temporary work agency services. Staff reiterated the importance of reforming and
pre-funding the severance pay system—which currently covers only part of formal employment and
is overly burdensome for enterprises—for enhancing labor mobility. In addition, staff argued that
extension of the minimum wage subsidy at an appropriately lower level would provide relief to
strained firms in the formal sector. The 2016 minimum wage increase was large and its impacts will
be staggered over the next two years, as union contracts are typically negotiated every 2 to 3 years

7

This is described in details in the 2016 Article IV Staff report
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

TURKEY

and use the minimum wage increases as a starting point in negotiations. While a nominal freeze in
the minimum wage will help restore competitiveness more quickly, it is not politically feasible.
Hence, staff called for moderate minimum wage increases aligned with expected inflation and
productivity gains, which in turn differ across regions. To this end, staff argued that the cost of labor
could be appropriately differentiated according to regional economic developments.
40.
Staff welcomed the new pension auto-enrollment law, but cautioned that its current
form curbs its impact on private saving. While it is a step in the right direction, important design
weaknesses risk undermining its key policy objectives (Box 6). Staff advocated for the need to
(i) centralize the collection of contributions in the Social Security Institute; (ii) create capacity in the
Pension Monitoring Center to act as procurement board and carry out record keeping; and (iii) open
competitive international auctions for asset management now and for custodianship in the future. In
addition, staff argued that the contribution rate should be increased to at least 6 percent, in order
for the new regime to have a meaningful impact on private saving.
41.
There was agreement on the need for better integration of refugees. Turkey is hosting a
large number of refugees, who are entitled to public services and work in the informal sector.
Legislative changes in January 2016 allowed Syrian refugees to apply for work permits. Thus far, the
uptake has been very low, due to legislative restrictions, skill mismatches, and administrative hurdles
for employers and employees (Box 7). Staff argued for simplification of the application process for
work permits and an active communication strategy to improve the uptake. In March 2016, the EU
and Turkey agreed on a framework to reduce irregular migration and channel international
assistance to refugees in Turkey. The disbursement of earmarked funds has been slow, due to the
complexity of the task of coordinating the work of a large number of NGOs and public agencies,
while ensuring proper utilization of funds. Full implementation of the agreement would help
improve the refugees’ access to education, health care, and public utilities.

Authorities’ views
42.
The authorities agreed on structural reform objectives, and their associated
challenges. They highlighted their structural reform vision as follows:


The new private pension automatic enrollment law should help stimulate saving and rebalance
the economy. The specific design features of the reform were prepared based on extensive
research of international best practices. They pointed to the fact that government has the
authority to increase contribution rates, if necessary.



Structural reforms to enhance the business climate will focus on legislative amendments to
simplify administrative and bureaucratic procedures, and implementation of the regional
investment incentive scheme.



Labor market conditions are to be improved through changes to the labor code to support
flexible employment, increased access to childcare facilities, and provision of relevant skill
training and effective internship programs. More progress is needed on the severance pay

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TURKEY

reform, and a careful, broad-based consultation with stakeholders is needed to support
successful implementation.
43.
The authorities broadly shared staff views on rising labor costs, competitiveness, and
refugee integration. They viewed the temporary minimum wage subsidy as appropriate. On the
integration of refugees into the workforce, the authorities attributed the slow uptake in work
permits to skill mismatch rather than administrative hurdles. The authorities called for strong
commitment of international financial assistance to make further progress on integrating refugees.

STAFF APPRAISAL
44.
The challenges facing Turkey have increased considerably since the last Article IV
Consultation. Domestic political uncertainty has increased significantly, taking a toll on economic
activity and testing several key domestic institutions. International conditions have also become
more challenging, marked by a rise in interest rates and dollar strength. Weak confidence and a
rapidly depreciating lira are reinforcing one another, raising concerns about the resilience of the
nonfinancial sector. The preceding benign period has not resolved pre-existing weaknesses,
including large current account deficits, high external financing needs, large FX-denominated debt
in nonfinancial corporates, a weak business climate, and high inflation. Moreover, productivity is
lagging and growth potential has declined against the background of structural bottlenecks and low
private investment rates.
45.
Institutional strength is a pre-requisite to tackle these challenges. Particularly in the
aftermath of the failed coup attempt, it is essential that key economic and financial public
institutions remain strong and credible, with their mandates preserved, and their policy frameworks
brought further towards international best practice. As staff has emphasized, there is a need to
strengthen the monetary transmission mechanism, and to enhance the management of contingent
liabilities. The FSAP underscores important avenues by which financial sector oversight and
supervision could be strengthened.
46.
Stronger macro-financial policies are necessary to bring down stubbornly high
inflation and reduce external vulnerabilities. The root causes of Turkey’s vulnerabilities are
structural (low private saving) and cyclical (externally funded, private sector up-leveraging favored
by easy international financing conditions). These weaknesses are exacerbated by the persistent
overshooting of the inflation target and risks stemming from the large, negative FX position of the
economy. Banks and corporates are leveraged and highly exposed to risks stemming from the high
share of borrowing in foreign currency.
47.
Avoiding an excessive slowdown is essential in the short run. While some near-term
slowdown in economic activity is beneficial to reduce external imbalances, a large fall in GDP growth
could lead to a vicious credit-income contraction cycle. Appropriate demand management calls for a
broadly neutral monetary stance—to the extent consistent with orderly FX market conditions—and
allowing automatic fiscal stabilizers to operate in full. Tighter monetary stance could be required to
prevent excessive Lira volatility. Turkey has some fiscal space to provide discretionary measures,
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

TURKEY

however any fiscal stimulus should internalize the role played by fiscal policy as a stability anchor,
particularly given the scarce credibility of monetary policy.
48.
In the medium-term, rebuilding buffers and tackling structural weaknesses is
important. Simplifying of the monetary policy framework and rebuilding credibility by appropriate
tightening of monetary policy are necessary steps toward reducing inflation. The recent loosening of
macroprudential measures risks being counterproductive in the context of high private
indebtedness. The focus of macroprudential policies should be kept squarely on maintaining the
soundness of the financial system. Finally, net international reserves should be increased.
49.
Slow progress with structural reforms and heightened political and economic
uncertainty are keeping the economy from reaching its full potential. Policies should aim at
improving the investment climate and ensuring adequate public institutional capacity in the wake of
the failed coup attempt. Further steps are needed to boost the internal and external competitiveness
of the formal economy, including keeping future minimum wage increases in check and addressing
labor market rigidities. The low private saving rate is limiting the balanced growth potential of the
economy. In this respect, the reform of the voluntary pension system is a step in the right direction,
but its impact will be limited unless its design is further aligned with international best practices.
50.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Turkey be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Box 1. Assessing the Impact of Shocks to Tourism
A decade of vibrant development made the tourism sector an important driver of the economic
activity. Turkey’s share in the global inbound tourist flows increased from 1.5 percent in early 2000s to
about 3 percent in 2015. Over that period the number of foreign tourists’ arrivals tripled and reached
36.2 million people. In 2007 the government launched a sector development program (Strategy 2023), which
included investment incentives, measures to address transportation and infrastructure bottlenecks, and
marketing activities. In 8 years, country’s capacity to accommodate tourists increased 2.5 times. In 2015,
travel services earned around US$27bn of exports revenues (3.7 percent of GDP and about 13 percent of
total export proceeds). In selected regions, it is one of the key employers. Overall, the tourism sector was
estimated to directly generate about 600 000 jobs (2.3 percent of the total employment), additional
approximately one million of is estimated to be created indirectly1.
In 2016 Turkey was hit by a major fall in foreign tourists’
arrivals, and recovery prospects remain subdued. Tourist
arrivals from Europe fell by over 30 percent, against the
backdrop of a sharp rise in the number of and a severity of
terrorist attacks in Turkey in the last few years. In addition to
that, Russian restrictions on charter flights and travel tours cut
the Russian tourists by more than two-thirds in
January-September. This contributed to about 30 percent drop
in exports of transportation services, and had negative
spillovers to the food and accommodation sectors. Studies
show that repeated terrorist attacks coupled with political
uncertainty tend to have long lasting effect on foreign tourist
arrivals. While the Russian sanctions were lifted in 3Q 2016,
repeated incidences of violence suggest that recovery of the
tourist inflows may appear weak due to security concerns.
Given linkages between tourism and other sectors, a
10 percent shock to foreign arrivals is estimated to have
0.3-0.5 percent impact on GDP in the first year after the
shock.2 This accounts for the fall in gross value added in food
and accommodation and transportation of about 2 percent
and 3 percent respectively. These three sectors represent over
46 percent of total tourist expenditures, and are the first to
experience the shock. The assessment is based on a Bayesian
VAR model estimated on quarterly data between 1998 and
2015. The model predicted that absent of policy measure to
offset the impact of the weak tourism sector and other positive
shocks GDP would decelerate to around 2 percent in 2016.

Box 2. Turkey: Benchmarking Private Debt Burdens
Aggregate debt risk metrics appear relatively benign in
Turkey. Turkey’s private debt-to-GDP ratio is significantly
below the threshold of 160 percent, used for
unconsolidated data in the EU Macroeconomic Imbalances
Procedure. At the same time, the aggregate debt burden in
Turkey is higher than in the Czech Republic and Poland—
two European countries with higher per capita incomes
known for a balanced development of credit markets.

However, sector-specific solvency risk metrics raise

in the exposure of Turkish corporates and households to
vulnerabilities stemming from indebtedness in the years
following the global financial crisis. As a result, Turkey now
ranks second in solvency risk exposure across European
countries outside the euro area. The readings of both the

Box 3. Turkey: Residential House Prices
Turkish house prices have been markedly increasing for several years. The prices for homes rose
cumulatively by 110 percent in nominal and 35 percent in real terms between end-2010 and July 2016.
Valuation appears stretched by a number of metrics, such as price-to-income and price-to-rent ratios. The
burden of household debt has also increased.

Demographic and socio-economic factors underpin the strong demand for housing. A young and
rapidly growing population combined with a high and rising rate of urbanization drive demand for
residential housing. In addition, the number of households has increased with a decline in average
household size. Household preferences have also shifted toward newer and larger houses, with stronger
construction codes.
Special sales campaigns and government
stimulus have buoyed house sales since July
2016. The government launched a campaign for
subsidized sales of 60,000 houses with mortgages
offered at below-market lending rates and higher
LTV ratios than the regulatory ceiling, in addition
to applying moral suasion on banks to lower
mortgage rates. Following the adoption of these
measures, total house sales rose by 2 percent
year-on-year in August. Since then, the LTV ceiling
was raised from 75 to 80 percent.

Box 4. Turkey: Contingent Liabilities Related to PPP and other Treasury Guarantees
The size of the overall PPP portfolio in Turkey has sharply risen
in recent years, reflecting the active infrastructure agenda of the
authorities. Total investment size has increased fivefold since 2010,
mostly in transportation, energy, and health (Figure 1). Total
investment value stands at $53 billion for 211 projects, of which
33 PPP projects with total investment value of US$38.8 billion are
under construction.
Management of PPPs and their fiscal risks is fragmented. The
legal and regulatory framework for PPPs is highly fragmented both
across sectors and type of PPP arrangements. For example, health,
education, and energy PPPs are subject to specific legislation apart
from the existing BOT law. Similarly, fiscal risks arising from
PPP-related guarantees are subject to different degrees of
monitoring, depending whether they are under the control of
20
the Treasury or other public entities (see below). Annual budget
16
laws set upper limits for contingent liabilities, but only for those
provided by the Treasury.

addition, the Debt Assumption Commitments (DACs)—wherein
senior loan payment guarantees could be extended by the
Treasury as well as by the special budget administrations and
SOEs for PPP projects that satisfy certain conditions—have also
been used from 2012 onwards. The outstanding stock of Treasury guaranteed external debt stood at
US$12 billion, and separately, the loans for which Treasury offered debt assumption for 3 PPP projects stood
at US$8.7 billion.
Information on guarantees issued by other public entities is scarce. The size and terms of contractual
obligations are generally not disclosed for PPP projects under line ministries and other public agencies. This
applies to both DACs issued by other public entities and FX-denominated price and volume guarantees
provided to various PPP projects. Quantification of the size of overall exposure is challenging due to lack of
information. Focusing on exposure from DACs on projects under construction and assuming that: (a) only the
minimum 20 percent of the total investment is equity financed; and (b) all of the remaining financing is
external debt covered by DACs, the estimated size of contingent liabilities would be roughly 4 percent of GDP
(including the Treasury DACs above). The size of overall contingent

The stock of standard Treasury guarantees to public banks has
risen in recent years. The share of financial institutions in
Treasury guaranteed external debt has risen to over 80 percent in
2015 from 43 percent in 2006 (Figure 2). The share of public banks
increased especially sharply, from 2 percent of external debt
guarantees in 2006 to 55 percent in 2015. The authorities justified
this shift by the superior internal risk management expertise of
these institutions relative to other beneficiaries.

Box 5. Turkey: Summary of FSAP Findings and Recommendations
Turkish banks can reasonably withstand severe stress provided it is short-lived, but capital shortfalls can
become significant should stress persist, and systemic risks and spillovers become high.
Supervision of banks, insurance companies, and FMIs. Assessments against international standards
spotlighted areas requiring further enhancements: (i) further development and deepening of the risk
assessment nature of banking inspections and follow up; (ii) applying greater rigor to the supervisory
evaluation and enforcement of credit risk and corporate governance rules; (iii) stronger governance,
independence and accountability would advance insurance supervision, which would be further enhanced by
the closer integration of supervisory functions, and additional focus on corporate governance and internal
controls within insurers; (iv) for the National Payments System (NPS), authorities should address
concentration of intraday liquidity at the end of the day, and institute a risk management framework for
interdependencies among FMIs.
Oversight and management of systemic risks. Stronger arrangements would be beneficial. In particular:
(i) additional clarity on the roles and responsibilities of the Financial Stability Committee (FSC), the Council of
Ministers, and of FSC member authorities, would be helpful; (ii) an explicit financial stability objective could
be provided for all FSC members; (iii) procedures to support more integrated risk identification and ensure
ex ante review of alternative policy options by the FSC could be implemented; (iv) coordination of policy
actions and follow-up would be strengthened by an agreement by member agencies to consider and to
respond to FSC recommendations in advance of taking policy decisions; and (iv) overall transparency and
disclosure need to be enhanced to foster credibility and accountability.
Crisis management and resolution., Key priorities include: legal changes to (i) equip BRSA with effective
recovery planning powers and empower SDIF to undertake resolvability assessments and resolution
planning, and to empower both agencies to require banks to make necessary changes to make plans
implementable; (ii) establish new resolutions tools for the SDIF, including powers for more comprehensive
business transfer, for establishing and capitalizing bridge banks, and for implementing bail-in; and
(iii) facilitate international bank data sharing by SDIF. Institutional arrangements should be strengthened to:
(i) provide additional clarification on various agencies’ responsibilities; (ii) limit BRSA involvement to pulling
the trigger for resolution and not also defining the type of resolution; (iii) provide more effective
coordination with FSC activities; and review resolution funding arrangements with the aim to reduce
contingent claims on taxpayers. Cross-border recovery and resolution arrangements should be bolstered
Systemic liquidity management. key priorities include: (i) orienting liquidity provision towards a single key
policy rate; (ii) increase net reserves such that gross reserves are within the range of 100–150 percent of the
ARA metric; (iii) redefine CBRT FX lending facility as ELA and increase conditionality; and (v) improve ELA
capacity (testing procedures, expand range of collateral, processes for government indemnities for CBRT).
Development of capital markets. This could decrease reliance on foreign currency. Policies to support the
consolidation of an interest rate derivatives market and stimulate liquidity in government and corporate
bond markets could facilitate hedging against interest rate fluctuations and enhance demand for capital
market products. Improvements in issuance regulations, disclosure and governance standards could restore
investor confidence, which has been recently shaken by renegotiations of corporate debt and poor
performance of IPOs.
Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT). Priorities include:
(i) completing the national ML/TF risk assessment; (ii) addressing the low level of convictions for ML; and
(iii) introducing customer due diligence requirements for politically exposed persons in line with the FATF
standard, as well as measures to mitigate the associated risks; (iv) effectively implementing the UN Security
Council Resolutions requirements relating to terrorist funds, and implementing and strengthening measures
to monitor cross-border transportation of cash.

Box 6. Turkey: Reform of Voluntary Private Pension System
Starting in 2017, workers will be enrolled automatically in a private pension plan, with a minimum
contribution of 3 percent of their gross wages. Staying in the system after the two-month opt-out period
would be rewarded by a one-off payment of TL1,000. In addition, the government will top-up employee
contributions by 25 percent and offer a 5 percent bonus on the accumulated amount, if at the time of
withdrawal, participants elect to receive an annuity.
The reform is a welcome step in the right direction. It preserves the freedom of individuals to choose;
exploits consumer inertia to maximize the impact on aggregate savings; caps asset management fees to
much lower levels than observed in the existing voluntary system; and attempts to reduce wasteful
competition in the market. However, the legislation passed suffers from serious design weaknesses that
weaken consumer protection and risk popular resentment, thereby undermining the reform’s key objectives:



The reform does not establish a public procurement board for periodic auctions of pension services,
with the exception of asset management. Employers are unlikely to be more skilled than individuals in
choosing pension plans for their workers.



Fee rates are charged on heterogeneous bases (asset under management) thus promoting competition
in the market and unnecessary marketing expenses. Fee rates would become obsolete over time and it
will be necessary to lower them periodically exposing the authorities to the risk of regulatory capture.



The Social Security Institute will not collect pension contributions so average costs are not minimized.



Pension firms’ sales forces are used to retain individuals in the system, generating incentives and
opportunities for mis-selling. A political appointee is in charge of investment rules.



The governance of the investment advisory committee is yet to be defined. Only Turkey-incorporated
asset managers are allowed to participate in the auctions.



Finally, the reform is not projected to increase sufficiently national savings.

Box 7. Turkey: Refugees in Turkey – Recent Developments
Turkey is one of the largest refugee-hosting countries with around 3 million of refugees. Officially
registered Syrian refugees are about 2.75 million (45 percent of whom are children aged below 18) (UNHCR,
2016), and refugees of other nationalities are estimated to be almost 0.3 million. However, some registered
refugees might have left, while there may be other non-registered refugees in Turkey, making precise
estimation of refugee numbers difficult. The government has begun validating the registration records and
plans to complete this exercise by mid-2017. This would also provide information on refugee movements
within Turkey, and thus improve targeting of financial assistance.
Given the large number of refugees, social and economic integration is challenging but crucial.
Around 90 percent of Syrian refugees had left the temporary protection centers (AFAD, 2016). Prior to 2016,
they could only work in the informal sector, which seems to have negatively affected local informal workers
with low labor force attachments, such as women and the low-skilled (Del Carpio and Wagner, 2015).
Legislative changes in January 2016 allow Syrian refugees to apply for work permits. However, at
end-October, only around 13,000 applications by Syrian refugees have been received (of which 10,000 were
approved, with one-third of the permits granted to the textile and wholesale and retail industries). The low
uptake may be explained by restrictions, such as firm-level quotas and requiring refugees to apply for
permits only in the municipality of initial registration, administrative hurdles, and limited communication.
Qualifications recognition, skill mismatch, and language difficulties may also contribute to limited
integration into formal employment.
International assistance could play an important role. Under the EU-Turkey agreement to reduce
irregular migration, the Facility for Refugees in Turkey was set up to provide support to refugees in Turkey in
the areas of humanitarian assistance, education, migration management, health, municipal infrastructure,
and socio-economic development. The Facility has an initial budget of €3 billion for 2016–17, and additional
funding of up to €3 billion by end-2018. As of end-October, of the overall initial budget, the total funding
allocated for implementation on humanitarian and non-humanitarian actions stood at €2.2 billion. Of these
€2.2 billion, 34 projects have been contracted worth €1.2 billion, out of which €677 million have been
disbursed to the implementation units.


The largest humanitarian support under the Facility is the

(allocated only): Total of €2.2 billion
Emergency Social Safety Net (ESSN), which provides direct
monthly cash transfers through debit cards to cover basic
needs of the most vulnerable refugee families. The entire

since more than two-thirds of school-aged Syrian refugees
remain out of the national education system. The direct grant for education should enable around half a
million Syrian students to receive education in Turkish.

Investors withdraw from specific risk asset classes
as they reassess underlying economic and financial

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize
in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant
to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30
and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the
authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly. “Short term” and “medium term” are meant to indicate
that the risk could materialize within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

Background. Turkey’s net international investment position (NIIP) widened to about -56 percent of GDP in
the end of 3Q2016 (mainly on the back of debt accumulation in the beginning of the year) and remains
weaker than those of peers. Foreign liabilities are just below 90 percent of GDP, including about 53 percent of
GDP in foreign currency. External debt is sustainable. Debt maturity improved, but risks remain significant
risks given short-term debt and portfolio investments in debt securities of about 30 percent of GDP and 42
percent of long-term debt have floating interest rates.
Assessment. The composition of liabilities exposes Turkey to liquidity shocks, investors sentiment and
increases in global interest rates. Unless the current account deficit (CAD) improves substantially in the years
ahead, Turkey’s NIIP would continue to deteriorate by some 10 percentage points of GDP in medium term.

Current
account

Background. The CAD is projected to remain close to its 2015 level of 4.5 percent of GDP. Weak tourism
season, Russian sanctions on trade and strong non-oil imports likely to outweigh the effect of lower energy
costs1/. The EBA model estimates that in 2016 the cyclically-adjusted CA was some 3.6 percent of GDP weaker
than the level implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. External sustainability (ES)
approach suggested the CAD was 1–2 percentage points above the level consistent with stabilizing NIIP at
the current level.
Assessment. Staff assesses that the CA gap remains in the range of -1 to -4 percent of GDP. This is consistent
with a CA norm in the range of -1 to -3.5 percent of GDP, reflecting the large investment needs of a fuel
importing emerging economy.
Background. Since hitting a 12-years minimum in September 2015, REER has increased by about 10 percent,
as Lira remained broadly stable and inflation showed persistence. As of October 2016 the REER was slightly
above its average 2015 level. The EBA REER index approach estimates a 4.2 percent overvaluation in 2016; the
REER level regression suggests a 15.4 percent overvaluation. Based on the ES approach, about 6 percent REER
adjustment is required to stabilize NIIP. In November Lira depreciated by about 10 percent amid capital
outflow from emerging markets.
Assessment. Consistent with the assessment of the CA gap, staff assesses that the REER remained overvalued
by about 5–15 percent on average in 2016.

Capital and
financial
accounts:
flows and
policy
measures

Background. Significant external financing needs have been comfortably met due to ample global liquidity.
The government and the private sector enjoy access to the international capital markets, net portfolio inflows
turned positive in 2016 and were enough to compensate for lower rollover ratio on syndicated loans in 3Q.
Turkey has not made use of capital controls on inflows or outflows.
Assessment. Still large share of short-term debt exposes Turkey to significant rollover risks. Gross external
financing needs are estimated at about 27 percent of GDP in 2016, making Turkey vulnerable to changes in
global market conditions.

FX
intervention
and reserves
level

Background. The exchange rate is floating. In April 2016 the central bank stopped selling foreign exchange to
commercial banks through regular auctions and significantly reduced direct sales of FX to energy importing
SOEs. By October, Turkey’s gross reserves (GIR) have increased by about US$8 billion due to government
borrowings and rediscount credit operations, and net reserves increased to US$35billion. Most of the gains in
GIR were lost in November as a result of falling banks required reserves and restriction imposed on the use of
FX collateral. GIR level is about 90 percent of the ARA metric, and reserves coverage of short-term debt is
about 70 percent. Adjusting the level of reserves for ROM-related reserve holdings and banks swap positions
vis-à-vis the CBRT, reduced it to 60 percent of the composite adequacy metric at the end of October 20162/.
Net reserves available for intervention are significantly lower than GIR.
Assessment. Given low net international reserves, further reserve accumulation is warranted. Foreign
exchange sales should be restricted to periods of disorderly market conditions.

In 2016, Turkey’s external position remains
weaker than the level consistent with mediumterm fundamentals and desirable policy settings.
The current account deficit remains sizable
despite gains from lower oil prices.
Net international reserves are still low, and the
NIIP will continue to deteriorate until the CA
deficit is reduced. Moreover, given large
financing needs and a high share of short-term
capital inflows, Turkey remains vulnerable to
capital flow reversal.
Potential policy responses:
Reducing the CA deficit is necessary to diminish
vulnerabilities The on-going economic
slowdown and deceleration of credit growth
help rebalancing. Some temporary fiscal
loosening is appropriate to avoid excessive
slowdown. However, a credible medium-term
consolidation plan to support increase public
saving over the medium term is necessary.
Further monetary easing should be avoided,
and real policy interest rates should remain
positive. Macroprudential measure should be
strengthened to lower foreign currency risk in
the economy. The CBRT should continue to
increase net international reserves, limiting
foreign exchange sales to smoothing periods of
excessive volatility.
Structural reforms are needed to enhance
private savings and allow higher growth with a
sustainable current account deficit. The new
pension auto-enrollment law is a step in the
right direction, however in the current form the
reform will have only marginal effect on
aggregate savings.

Technical Background Notes 1/ The windfall of lower energy prices are estimated at about 1 percent of GDP in 2016. The fuel trade balance was -5.9 percent of GDP on average
in 2011–2015. At the same time, in the first nine months, foreign tourist’s arrivals fell by 32 percent due to Russian sanctions and amid rising security concerns. This contributed to
a fall in exports proceeds from travel (-31 percent), transportation (-30 percent), and the shuttle trade (-14 percent).
2/ ROM (Reserve Option Mechanism) allows commercial banks to meet their reserve requirements on lira-denominated liabilities by using foreign exchange and gold. The ROM
FX and gold reserves are held at the blocked accounts in the CBRT for 14 days, and may be fully substituted with Lira liquidity after this maintenance period. Domestic banks may
also use their FX deposits in the CBRT as collateral for Lira liquidity facilities, including swaps with maturities of up to 1 month. As of September 2016 the total amount of FX
included in gross international reserves and related to ROM and swap operations with domestic banks stood at about US$27bn (23 percent of total reserves).

Annex III. External Debt Sustainability
Turkey’s external debt, while sustainable, is high and vulnerable to valuation shocks.1 Under the
baseline, debt is forecast to stabilize at around 60 percent of GDP in the medium term. However, it is
susceptible to a large Lira depreciation. In addition, annual external financing needs in excess of 30
percent of GDP expose the economy to high liquidity and rollover risks.

Background and assumptions
1.
External debt continued to increase and is estimated to reach 59 percent of GDP in
2016. A large share of the external debt, about 26 percent of GDP, resides with banks who
intermediate capital inflows into domestic loans, mostly in Lira but also in foreign currency.
Non-financial corporates (NFC) also recently have been borrowing directly from abroad. NFC’s
external debt is estimated to exceed 19 percent of GDP in 2016, increasing by about US$12bn over
the year. Bank loans constitute about over 60 percent of total external debt of the outstanding debt
stock of the private sector. However, the role of portfolio flows has increased recently, reflecting
lower demand for project loans, borrower’s efforts to diversify investor, as well as changes in
creditor preferences in favor of more liquid instruments. Private creditors, including bondholders,
hold close to 90 percent of Turkey’s total external debt.

2.
While the maturity structure has recently improved, the cost of financing is increasing.
The stock of short-term debt with original maturity of less than 12 months fell markedly in 2015. An
increase in reserve requirements on short term liabilities encouraged banks to take debt with longer
maturities, while NFCs were borrowing directly from abroad with medium and long-term debt
maturities. In practice, however, a significant part of the short-term syndicated loans was extended
by just a few days or months beyond the critical threshold of 365 days. Rating downgrades have

contributed to the increase in the cost of external funding, which has already been rising due to,
among other factors, maturity extension.

Assessment
3.
Turkey’s external debt, while sustainable, is vulnerable to valuation shocks. The debt
trajectory stabilizes under the baseline at around 64 percent of GDP. Given that over 90 percent of
Turkish external debt is denominated in foreign currency, the debt path is susceptible to exchange
rate movements. Standard stress tests suggest debt level could increase substantially under the real
depreciation shock. A permanent Lira depreciation by 30 percent would push the external debt stock
to 85 percent of GDP by 2021. This analysis however does not account for the potential contraction
of the current account deficit associated with such sharp currency movements. A steeper recovery of
fuel prices, leading to non-interest current deficit of about 4.2 percent would push the debt ratio to
around 69 percent of GDP over the medium term.
4.
Large external financing requirements and a significant share of debt with adjustable
rates make the economy vulnerable to shifts in global liquidity. Despite some increase in
average maturity of external debt, annual rollover needs remain close to a quarter of GDP. Total
external financing needs are about 30 percent of GDP over the next few years. Over 60 percent of
total external debt, including debt with short maturities, is indexed to global interest rates. As a
result, a tightening of global liquidity conditions, an increase in Turkey spreads, or capital outflows
from emerging markets in general could quickly translate into higher borrowing costs. According to
the DSA simulation results, an increase in interest rates by 1 standard deviation compared to the
baseline would increase the debt level by additional 3 percentage points to 66 percent of GDP.
Moreover, a sudden stop in capital flows may trigger a simultaneous rise in both borrowing costs
and exchange rate pressure.

Annex IV. Public Debt Sustainability
At about 35 percent of GDP (measured as general government gross debt according to Maastricht
criteria), Turkey’s public debt ratio is well below its historical ten-year average. Gross public sector
financing needs have declined significantly and will remain low over the medium term. The DSA
suggests that Turkey’s government debt is sustainable under different shock scenarios. Given the debt
structure (average maturity of 6.2 years, 68 percent of total debt at fixed interest rates, and only
35 percent of the debt in foreign exchange) the direct interest and exchange rate pass-through to the
budget is relatively low. Lower GDP growth rates, potentially combined with other macro shocks or a
contingent liability shock, would lead to an increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio. While all public debt
profile indicators are below early warning benchmarks, the high external financing requirements point
to risks arising from the external debt position.

Baseline and Realism of Projections1
1.
Debt-levels. Turkey’s debt-to-GDP ratio is moderate at 32.9 percent at end-2015. Staff
forecast that the ratio will slightly increase in the short-run due to the ongoing and projected fiscal
expansion before resuming its declining path. The debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to reach
34.8 percent in 2021—up by 2 pp since end-2015. The interest rate/growth differential contributes
to the decline in debt-to-GDP ratio, while the primary balance first contributes to an increase then a
decrease in the debt-to-GDP ratio. At 5.3 percent of GDP in 2015, gross public financing needs have
declined from 15 percent on average for 2005–13—a significant accomplishment.
2.
Growth. Past projections of growth outcomes show high forecast errors, possibly due to
high volatility of GDP in Turkey, but don’t seem to have a systematic bias that undermine the
assessment of sustainability. The current growth projections are similar to the levels for 2014–15,
which lessens their positive impact in reducing the level of debt. A negative output gap is opening,
but is projected to close over the medium term. Turkey’s debt is highly sensitive to big swings in
GDP growth, highlighting the relevance of growth shocks in the stress tests.
3.
Sovereign yields. Turkey’s yields remain volatile, although they remain below the levels of
the first quarter of 2014. The spreads against the US bonds in the last three months remained on
average at 331 bps, higher than its lowest value of 118 bps observed in May 2013. The effective
interest rate is forecast to decline from 8.8 percent in 2015 to 8.1 percent in 2016. However, in the
medium term the effective rates are expected to increase due to the push from international rates.
4.
Fiscal adjustment. In the baseline the structural primary balance improves in the medium
term. The maximum projected 3-year adjustment of the cyclically-adjusted primary balance is 2
percent of GDP, while the maximum projected 3-year average level of cyclically-adjusted primary
balance is 0.8 percent of GDP.

The new DSA framework is described in (http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2013/050913.pdf).

5.
Maturity and rollover. Given the current debt structure (average maturity of 6.2 years,
69 percent share of fixed interest debt to total debt, and only 35 percent denominated in foreign
currency), the direct interest and exchange rate pass-through to the budget are small.
Shocks and Stress Tests
6.
Primary balance and interest rate shocks do not affect the debt dynamics substantially, while
growth shock and contingent liability shocks lead to a temporary increase in debt.


Primary balance shock. A deterioration of 1.0pp of GDP in the primary balance for 2 years
slows down the downward trend of debt-to-GDP ratio relative to the baseline. Sovereign
borrowing costs are pushed up (25 bps for each 1 percent of GDP worsening in the primary
balance). The impact on the debt-to-GDP ratio and gross financing needs levels by 2021 is
modest.



Growth shock. Real output growth rates are lowered by 1 standard deviation, or 4.2 percentage
points, for 2 years starting in 2017. The decline in growth leads to lower inflation
(0.25 percentage points per 1 percentage point decrease in GDP growth). The nominal primary
balance deteriorates significantly compared to the baseline, as nominal revenues fall against
unchanged expenditure plans, reaching -5 percent of GDP by 2018. The deterioration in primary
balance leads to higher sovereign borrowing costs. The debt-to-GDP ratio increases to about
46 percent during the growth shock and then gradually trends down. Gross public financing
needs climb toward 16.3 percent of GDP before trending down to 14.2 percent of GDP by the
end of the period.



Interest rate shock. The real effective rate reaches similar levels as in 2009, which implies a
permanent increase in spreads by about 400bps. The government’s interest bill reaches an
implicit average interest rate of 15 percent by 2021. The debt-to-GDP ratio climbs to around
39 percent, and gross public financing needs increase to around 13 percent of GDP by 2021.



Contingent liability shock. A one-time bail out of the financial sector is assumed to increase
non-interest expenditures by 10 percent of banking sector assets.2 This is combined with real
GDP growth shock (1 standard deviation for 2 years). Sovereign borrowing costs are pushed up
(25 bps for each 1 percent of GDP worsening in the primary balance) while inflation declines
(0.25 percentage points per 1 percentage point decrease in GDP growth). Debt rises to
45 percent of GDP in 2018 and then gradually declines. Gross public financing needs increase to
about 14 percent of GDP in the medium term.

2

This shock is equivalent to 4.8 percent of GDP. The shock could also be seen to cover (a combination of) other
contingencies, part of which could be a bailout of PPP projects or loan guarantees. PPP projects with treasury
investment guarantees amount to 0.9 percent of GDP, treasury guaranteed loans (outside the general government)
amount to 1.6 percent of GDP, and loan subject to debt assumption amount to 1.1 percent of GDP.

WORLD BANK RELATIONS
1.

Turkey and the World Bank Group (WBG) have a strong partnership, that is based on

Turkey’s National Development Plans (NDPs). The 10th Development Plan (2014–18) outlines the
priority development areas for the Government, and the WBG’s current and future programs aim to
support key aspects of this plan. The WBG is preparing a Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD), which
have been shared with the Government and will soon be finalized. This SCD discusses the main
challenges to reducing poverty and sustaining growth in Turkey. The SCD and NDP both provide a strong
foundation for the new WBG Country Partnership Framework (CPF) that is under preparation. The CPF will
outline the WBG’s strategy for FY17–21 and articulate the main areas of the WBG engagement, both
technically and financially.
2.

The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) FY12-16 has delivered financing of over US$9.6

billion. Throughout the CPS period, project implementation has been smooth, meeting disbursement
targets and development objectives. The CPS financing includes US$4.3 billion through the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), US$3.6 billion through the International Finance
Corporation (IFC), and nearly US$1.7 billion though the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
(MIGA).

A. International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
3.

Turkey is the sixth-largest borrower of the IBRD in terms of debt outstanding. Turkey’s

active portfolio of investment operations with the World Bank’s IBRD financing includes 12 projects with
total net commitments of US$4.5 billion (as of November 2016). The investment portfolio and pipeline
support the energy sector, financial and private sector development, urban development, and health care.
4.

Turkey values the WBG’s analytical and technical knowledge work. Analytical work allowed

the WBG to provide knowledge in priority areas that were supportive of a wide range of Turkey`s
development challenges. The WBG responded to client demand for partnership in delivering global
knowledge and analytical work. A growing area of common interest is sharing Turkey’s experiences with
other developing countries.
5.

A key engagement also concerns the Syrian refugees living in Turkey. The WBG is currently

providing assistance in the area of social support and adaptation, labor markets, and the economy, and
education, as well as in the cross-cutting areas of data collection, measurement, and monitoring.

B. International Finance Corporation
6.

With the committed portfolio of around US$3.8 billion, Turkey represents the

second-largest country exposure for the IFC globally. In FY16, the IFC had a fourth consecutive record
year in Turkey, investing US$1.8 billion in projects to improve municipal services, combat climate change,
develop local capital markets, bolster supplies of renewable energy, and support smaller businesses.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TURKEY

7.

IFC’s committed portfolio at the beginning of the CPS period (FY12) stood at US$2.3 billion

(own account), while at the end of the FY16 it increased to US$3.8 billion. The portfolio has been
further diversified, with financial markets operations decreasing from 48 percent in FY12 to 41 percent in
FY16, infrastructure increasing from 27 to 34 percent, manufacturing, services and agriculture portfolio
falling from about 22 to 20 percent, and media, technology and telecommunications increasing from 3 to
5 percent. The quality of the portfolio also improved, as NPLs decreased from $68.6 million at the
beginning of the CPS period to $15.3 million at the end of FY16 (or from 3.9 percent to 0.6 percent of
outstanding loan portfolio).

C. Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
8.

Turkey is MIGA’s largest country by gross exposure, representing almost 12 percent of

MIGA’s gross portfolio. In FY16, MIGA’s portfolio in the country comprised a number of projects in the
infrastructure, financial, and services sectors with gross exposure of US$1.695 billion or net exposure of
US$537 million. MIGA intervention helped mobilize foreign private financing in support of key strategic
areas of the economy, such as healthcare, the financial sector, and the transport sector. MIGA’s product
mix include the traditional political risk insurance as well as the non-honoring, credit guarantee product.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of December 1, 2016)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision to the Fund is broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, despite some
shortcomings especially in national accounts and government finance statistics.
National Accounts: Quarterly national accounts are published with a 2–3 month lag. The Turkish
Statistical Institute (TURKSTAT) compiles and disseminates quarterly GDP by production and
expenditure approaches, in current prices and in volume terms. The annual GDP is a sum of the
four quarters. The GDP by income approach was estimated for 2002–2012, but the results are not
yet published. The main weaknesses of the system for compiling quarterly GDP at current prices
are the lack of annual benchmarks and the reliance of fixed ratios that are outdated (ratios from
the 2002 Supply and Use Tables (SUTs) are used). TURKSTAT is now putting in place a regular
compilation system for independent annual estimates of GDP and for quarterly GDP
benchmarked to annual data. TURKSTAT plans to disseminate revised series of national accounts
estimates—both annual and quarterly data, covering the period 2009–15—based on the System of
National Accounts 2008 (2008 SNA)/The European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010) in the
coming months. Sectoral financial balance sheets are compiled on a quarterly basis. Sectoral
income accounts data for 2009–15 are expected to be published in the coming months.
Price Statistics: The consumer price index (CPI) and the producer price index (PPI) generally
conform to international standards. The CPI does not cover owner-occupied dwellings,
commodities produced by households for own consumption, and expenditures on commodities
obtained through in-kind payments. The PPI is compiled only by product (and not by economic
activity).
Government Finance Statistics: Coverage of the budget is largely complete. Data for some fiscal
operations conducted through extra budgetary funds are available only with long lags. Fiscal
analysis is further complicated by some quasi-fiscal operations carried out by state banks, state
owned enterprises (SOEs), and other public entities; and technical problems associated with
consolidating the cash-based accounts of governmental entities with the accrual-based
accounting of SEEs. It is difficult to reconcile fiscal data with monetary and BOP data, especially in
the accounting of external debt flows and central government deposits.
The latest data available for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook are for
2015 and cover the general government sector and its subsectors with coverage of both stocks
and flows, including a full general government balance sheet. Monthly budgetary data on a cash
basis and quarterly general government data on an accrual basis are reported on an irregular
basis for publication in International Financial Statistics (IFS), starting from September 2009.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2017 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Prepared By

The European Department

The purpose of this supplement is to inform the Board about the latest economic and
policy developments and recent revisions to Turkey’s national accounts data. On December
8th, a policy package in support of the economy was announced. On December 12th,
historical GDP data have been revised up. The measures and the statistical revision do not
alter the thrust of the staff appraisal, as the underlying economic developments and their
implications for policies appear unchanged.

Update of recent developments
1.
The economy contracted in Q3 2016 but there are signs of stabilization
in Q4. After slowing in Q2, the seasonally and calendar adjusted GDP contracted by
2.7 percent in Q3 2016 compared to the previous quarter, mostly as high public
expenditures could not offset weakness in private consumption and investment. In Q4,
high frequency indicators, including sales of durable goods, house sales, VAT on
imports, consumer loan growth, suggest stabilization (and mild recovery in some
sectors) for domestic private consumption. However, industrial production, consumer
as well as business sentiment, and job creation remain weak.
2.
The Lira continued weakening in December, bringing the depreciation
in the last three months to about 20 percent with respect to the US dollars. This
has further amplified the pressures on corporate balance sheets and bank asset quality,
stemming from the high share of foreign currency (FX) loans. The government has
taken steps to reduce domestic use of FX. It has instructed public institutions to collect
FX receivables in lira in the short term, and make new public procurement contracts
payable in lira. Gross international reserves (GIR) have declined by US$4 billion to
US$114 billion in November and continued to fall in December. Net international
reserves remained broadly stable, as the fall in GIR was driven mainly by the withdrawal
of banks’ FX deposits, including due to lower reserve requirements.
3.
On December 8th, the government announced a package of measures to
revive growth and support the currency. The measures include the following:
(1) Increasing the capital of the Turkish Eximbank; (2) Providing state guarantees of up

TURKEY

to TRY25 billion (US$7.2 billion or 1.2 percent of GDP) through the Credit Guarantee Fund for
corporate loans, with preferential terms for exporters and SMEs; (3) Capping the interest rate on
public sector deposits at public banks below current market rates for longer maturities, reduction
until end-2017 of general provisions on loans to firms, and easing the conditions for banks to
restructure non-performing loans; and (4) Temporary cuts in taxes and deferring social security
contributions of employers from the first to the fourth quarter of 2017 to support employment and
promote industrial investment.
4.
The new measures are intended to be financed by (unidentified) expenditure
reallocation. The authorities estimate the cost of the state guarantees to be no greater than TRY
17.5 billion (0.6–0.7 percent of GDP) for state guarantees and TRY 15–16 billion (0.7 percent of GDP)
for the other measures over three years. The authorities plan to fund these measures by shifting
existing budgetary allocations, and have ruled out tax increases or additional borrowing for the new
measures. However, sources of financing have not been identified within the budget.

Revision of national accounts data
5.
On December 12th, 2016, the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat) announced major
revisions to national accounts data. The revision and newly published data address some areas
identified by staff as needing improvement in the national statistics.1 The revisions primarily affect
the period 2009–15. The data changes are mostly on account of updated methodology, improved
estimation methods, and implementation of the latest versions of international statistics
standards—System of National Accounts, 2008 and European System of Accounts, 2010.2
6.
Both nominal and real GDP were revised up. The largest changes are for the period
2011–2015, over which annual real GDP growth has been revised up by an average of
2.7 percentage points (Table 1.) The upward revision mostly affected construction and financial
service sectors, as well as investment.

Staff assessment
7.
The authorities’ policy measures build on the approach they have taken to date to
strengthen demand, but staff maintains the reservations noted in the staff report. The new
measures may ease existing loan supply constraints but their effect is probably limited in the current
uncertain situation. The measures do not address the underlying causes of the credit slowdown,
including the heightened counterparty risk resulting from domestic uncertainty, and the effect of a
weakening currency on the corporate debt overhang. At the same time, the government’s

are now derived independently, based on the 2012 Supply and Use Table. Nominal GDP by income approach and
sectoral income accounts are now published for 2009–2015.

Since then, there has not been any further consultation with STA on this matter.

contingent liabilities will rise, and asset quality issues could deteriorate, requiring banks to conserve
capital.
8.
The data revisions improved external sector indicators but not enough to change
staff’s assessment of the external sector position. The revisions lower the current account (CA)
deficit in 2015 to 3.8 percent of GDP (0.7 percent of GDP lower than before the revision.) Ratios of
the external debt and the net international investment position (NIIP) to GDP stand at 46 and
44 percent at end-2015 (9 percentage points lower than before the revision) with similar
adjustments expected in 2016. Consequently, staff assesses that the 2016 CA gap is in the range
of -1 to -3 percent of GDP, and Turkey’s external position remains weaker than the level consistent
with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings. The external debt remains
sustainable, but the NIIP is still projected to widen significantly over the medium term.
9.
Similarly, staff’s assessment of fiscal space remains broadly unchanged. The GDP data
revisions imply that the 2015 fiscal deficit is 0.2 percent of GDP lower (Figure 1.) The decline in the
end-2015 public debt ratio is 5 percent of GDP. However, data revisions also imply lower fiscal
revenues relative to the size of the economy. Public debt is sustainable and there is some fiscal
space for temporary stimulus. However, persistent external imbalances, and the dependence of the
banking and corporate sectors on external financing with substantial rollover needs, call for
prudence in using fiscal space.
10.
The statistical revision and policy initiatives do not alter the thrust of the staff
appraisal. Staff’s assessment of underlying economic developments post-data revision, is consistent
with its views at the time of the Article IV consultation policy discussions. The GDP data confirm that
the economy has been contracting. Therefore, staff maintains its recommendation for moderately
looser fiscal and tighter monetary stance. The new measures further ease the macroprudential
regime and add to public contingent liabilities, increasing the risks which are discussed in the Staff
Report.
11.
The authorities indicated that the revised national accounts data will not alter their
objectives and key tenets of economic policy making. Economic policies will focus on increasing
stable and inclusive growth, reducing inflation, preserving the downward trend in the current
account deficit, enhancing competitiveness, employment and productivity, improving the quality of
fiscal discipline, and strengthening public finances in the medium term.

Statement by Mr. Taşkın Temiz, Alternate Executive Director for Turkey
January 11, 2017
We thank staff for the comprehensive papers. The Turkish authorities convey their
appreciation for the constructive discussions and comprehensive analyses during the Article
IV and FSAP consultations.
I.

Overview

Political, macroeconomic and financial stability have been the basis for Turkey’s
economic performance and structural transformation, raising Turkey’s status to an upper
middle-income country and increasing its resilience to shocks.
External and domestic uncertainties have heightened recently. External headwinds
include the subdued global economic and productivity growth, bouts of financial market
volatility, the strengthening US dollar, sluggish global trade prospects, the ongoing
realignments in China and commodity exporter countries as well as the current difficult
geopolitical environment. Turkey has also faced homegrown challenges stemming from the
huge influx of refugees, terrorist attacks and a failed coup attempt. Turkey has managed to
mitigate the implications of all these challenges weighing on its economic outlook and
preserved its resilience to both external and internal shocks mostly owing to its solid
macroeconomic fundamentals and sound macro-framework, which are based on the
following three long-standing pillars:
1. A prudent public sector financial management framework. The strong fiscal position
and economic growth, together with decelerating real interest rates, put public debt on a
downward trend to sustainable levels.
2. Sound implementation of monetary policy. An independent central bank, inflation
targeting and flexible exchange-rate regimes have been essential for securing financial
stability and bringing the inflation rate closer to the target.
3. A strong financial sector with a solid regulation and supervision framework.
Together, the Turkish Treasury, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT), the
Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA), the Capital Markets Board (CMB)
and the Savings Deposit Insurance Fund (SDIF) have established solid risk management
and monitoring capabilities. The financial system, without any solvency problems, is
supported by robust macro-prudential and resolution frameworks while the regulatory
framework has been significantly upgraded. The Financial Stability Committee has been
an effective coordinating body. Local currency bond and equity markets have developed
further; the financial instruments are diversified and maturities extended.
In addition, an open economy, Turkey has a dynamic and flexible private sector; households
with no FX liabilities; increasing per capita income; a diversified and large economy; a
favorable demographic structure with a young population and an increasing female labor
participation; diverse trade linkages and improved physical infrastructure.

2
The authorities remain determined to address the persistent structural issues. The low
productivity level, relatively low saving rates, a noticeable current account deficit, gross
external financing need and labor market rigidities weigh on the Turkish economy. The
authorities have been taking the necessary policy actions and measures to promote growth
and further boost the economy’s resilience by implementing sound macroeconomic policies
and the structural reforms as laid out in the 2014–2018 Development Plan and in the
2017–2019 Medium-Term Program (MTP).
II.

Recent Macroeconomic Developments

Despite the strong headwinds, the Turkish economy has remained resilient thanks to
strong fiscal and monetary policies and a sound financial system. Economic activity
remained buoyant and expanded by 3.9 percent in the first half of 2016, driven mostly by
domestic demand and supported by the services and industrial sectors. The tourism sector
contracted amid geopolitical tensions and the output in the agricultural sector remained
lackluster due to adverse weather conditions. The failed coup attempt took its toll on
confidence and weighed on consumption and investment expenditures, resulting in a decline
in economic activity in the third quarter of 2016. It is worth emphasizing that calendar effects
have also played a major role in limiting the growth prospects in the third quarter. Economic
activity rebounded in the last quarter due to increased domestic demand following the
recovery in consumer loans. The authorities estimate headline growth to remain moderate in
2016.
Immediately after the coup attempt, the Turkish authorities introduced measures to
shore up financial markets operations and liquidity. The CBRT announced measures
geared toward providing banks with the needed liquidity. At the same time, banks were
allowed to place FX deposits as collateral without limits for needed Turkish Lira liquidity.
The CBRT has started a gradual withdrawal of the unlimited provision of Turkish Lira
liquidity against FX collateral since November 2016.1
The inflation rate has remained high mostly due to food prices and the domestic
currency depreciation and the increases in energy prices on the back of tax adjustments
and administered prices. Food inflation, which had been among the main drivers of
headline inflation, lost steam as tourism fell and the decline in exports to Russia lifted the
pressure on domestic food prices. The lagging effects of the cumulative exchange rate
developments and tax adjustments continue to weigh on the annual inflation and core
inflation figures. Wage developments added to the cost side pressures and limited the
improvement in the consumer price inflation in 2016.

1

Implementation of limits for FX collateral deposits placed with the CBRT restarted as of November 11, 2016.
Banks’ limits are applied as four times the limits allocated before July 17, 2016.

3
Plunging tourism revenues impacted the improvement in the current account shortfall.
Tourism receipts have been a major element in mitigating the chronic deficit in the trade
balance. Although the deterioration in tourism in 2016 is estimated to have wiped out around
1 percent of GDP, the improvement in the energy balance and the gains in market share in
the EU helped mitigate the impact on the current account deficit.
TURKSTAT recently revised the GDP series and its breakdown to align the
methodology with the EU and UN. The revisions may affect the assessments of the
Turkish economy. But, considering the cut-off date and data set in the staff report, the
economic references in this statement—unless otherwise stated—apply the old GDP series.
The revised national accounts data, despite implying great policy buffers, will not alter
the objectives and key tenets of the economic policy making. Policies will be geared
toward promoting stable and inclusive growth, lowering the inflation rate toward the target
level, preserving the downward trend in external imbalances, enhancing competitiveness,
employment and productivity, improving the quality of fiscal discipline, and strengthening
public finances.
III.

Economic Outlook

The 2017–2019 MTP, announced in October 2016, envisages a slightly higher growth
outlook compared to staff’s projections. Growth is expected to gain pace and reach
4.4 percent next year on the back of a recovery in the tourism sector and domestic demand
driven by a pickup in private investment and consumption in response to measures
introduced by the government recently. The authorities expect a growth rate of 5 percent in
2018 and 2019 as global and domestic uncertainties gradually wane, private investments,
supported by investment incentives, should improve, while structural reforms are expected to
raise total factor productivity (TFP).
Price pressures will ease gradually bringing the inflation rate closer to the target in the
medium term. The authorities expect inflation to gradually decline in 2017 and reach
5 percent in 2018, supported by a cautious monetary policy stance and structural measures to
reduce the rigidities especially in food prices. The CBRT remains wary of the potential
upside risks which the recent currency weakness could pose on the inflation outlook and will
maintain its price stability oriented monetary policy stance.
External rebalancing will prevail at a modest pace. With the normalization of the relations
with Russia and the improving confidence, tourism revenues are estimated to rebound
gradually. The recent depreciation in the exchange rate, even though cyclical, will also help
the rebalancing. Structural reforms to decelerate Turkey’s import dependency are expected to
lower the current account deficit in the medium term.

IV.

Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy

The CBRT intends to complete the monetary policy simplification process to improve
the transmission mechanism, align the short-term market rates with the funding rate
and ultimately ensure funding via a single policy rate. The CBRT slashed its marginal
funding rate onwards cumulatively by 250 basis points (bp) to 8.25 percent since March 2016
while keeping the one-week repo and overnight borrowing rates constant until November.
The Turkish Lira came under pressure in October due to global and local factors. Concerned
about the possible spillovers of the recent FX depreciation on the inflation expectations and
pricing behavior, the CBRT hiked the one-week repo rate by 50 basis points to 8.00 percent
and the upper end of the corridor by 25 basis points to 8.5 percent in November. In addition
to the rate hikes, the FX reserve requirement was cut by 50 bp which released US$1.5 billion
to the market and the maximum maturity on FX rediscounts was extended to March 2017
allowing exporters to keep FX proceeds until March 2017. As indicated in the most recent
Monetary Policy Committee meeting, inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other
factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and the cautious monetary policy stance
will be maintained.
The exchange rate movements are closely monitored. The Central Bank stopped providing
direct FX liquidity to the banking system through FX auctions at the end of April in a bid to
preserve the level of net FX reserves2 and did not directly intervene in the FX market in the
most recent episode of currency volatility but expressed its readiness to intervene directly or
provide FX liquidity through flexible auctions if deemed necessary to avert disorderly market
conditions. In the meantime, the CBRT has made a number of changes in the FX liquidity
provision to ease the pressure on FX supply. FX reserve option coefficients were cut in
October and November, providing additional FX liquidity of US$1.3 billion. Moreover, the
upper limit of FX reserve requirements that can be maintained on average were increased by
1 point in October, which enabled banks to use US$2.9 billion to meet their FX liquidity
needs. To strengthen its reserves, the CBRT has continued to provide export rediscount
credits to exporters, improved the conditions of these credits and recently introduced a new
facility of the admission of wrought or scrap gold as required reserves.
V.

Fiscal Policy

Public debt is low and sustainable with a strong composition and management. The
public debt burden is projected to fall to 32.9 percent of GDP in 2016 and is envisioned to be
below 30 percent at the end of 2019. In addition to the level of public debt its composition in
terms of maturity, interest rate, and currency has improved in the last decade. The share of
fixed rate debt is 70 percent of the central government debt, boosting the resilience to interest
rate shocks. Since around 65 percent is local currency denominated, an additional buffer to
foreign currency shocks is provided. The duration of domestic and external debt is around

Treasury also diversified its portfolio to enhance investor bases and to support local currency

The budget deficit has been under control and supportive for macroeconomic stability.
The central government and public sector overall deficits are expected at 1.6 percent and
1.7 percent of GDP respectively in 2016 and are projected to remain below 2 percent of GDP
throughout the MTP period. Taking into account the level of around 2.5 percent of GDP
interest payments, the level of the overall deficits explicitly implies positive primary
surpluses which would still ensure a declining trend in the public debt burden.
Public finance remains supportive to economic growth. Since the 2001 financial crisis,
fiscal policy in Turkey was geared toward bringing public debt down to sustainable levels,
containing the high inflation and current account deficit via creating high primary surpluses.3
A significant tightening of the primary fiscal balance has helped contain the public debt
dynamics and accumulate fiscal buffers. As public debt sustainability is not a concern and
given the risks to the growth outlook, the fiscal policy stance was revised in a bid to support
near-term growth and also to raise the potential growth in the medium term, while ensuring
that the debt-to-GDP ratio remains on a sustainable track. In this respect, the MTP envisages
that fiscal policy will aim at boosting growth, maintaining economic stability, keeping the
current account deficit at a sustainable level, and stimulating domestic savings and
investments. Public infrastructure investments, regional development, education, R&D
support and incentives will be the main expenditures.
Fiscal risks are manageable. The Turkish Treasury closely monitors, conducts risk analyses
and internally reports all contingent liabilities and risks to the Treasury Debt and Risk
Management Committee on a regular basis. Additionally, the Ministry of Finance issued a
secondary legislation in July 2015 to enhance the coverage of public institutions beyond the
Treasury. The authorities acknowledge the desirability of expanding fiscal risk disclosure to
the entities beyond the Turkish Treasury, and strengthening PPP governance. Regarding
PPPs specifically, the government declared in the MTP that the process of planning,
implementation, monitoring and evaluation of PPP projects will be enhanced; the capacity of
public institutions will be improved, and monitoring and managing the risks to debt
sustainability stemming from contingent liabilities arising from public investment guarantees
and commitments including PPP schemes, will be strengthened. The authorities have already
started working on a PPP Framework legislation which is envisaged to be in line with best
practices in project monitoring, risk oversight and disclosure. The authorities also reiterate
their intention to align the sovereign wealth fund with international best practices.

Financial Sector Policies and FSAP

Turkey has a strong regulatory, supervisory and policy framework. The General
Framework for the regulation and supervision of the financial sector, oversight and

The average (IMF-defined) primary surplus of the public sector between 2003–2008 was 4 percent and
2.2 percent between 2003–2015. The IMF-defined primary surplus is an indicator introduced in 1999 to monitor
the entire public sector (including SOEs), subtracting many one-off revenues such as dividend payments from
Central Banks and state banks and privatization revenues.

management of systemic risks, managing systemic liquidity, financial safety nets, bank
resolution, and crisis management arrangements and AML/CFT, has been significantly
enhanced in the last five years. Moreover, the authorities have made good progress in
developing a macro-prudential policy framework and have applied a wide range of tools to
contain and mitigate the cyclical build-up of risks, as well as to strengthen the structural
resilience and robustness of the Turkish financial system by correcting misaligned incentives
and lowering systemic vulnerabilities. With the strategic oversight of the Financial Stability
Committee, which brings together the heads of the financial regulatory agencies to exchange
views on emerging systemic risks and policy responses, the management of systemic risks
further improved.
Turkish banks are well-regulated and remain resilient to shocks4. Banks’ capital buffers
remain high with an overall capital adequacy ratio of 16 percent, conservative risk weighing
and low leverage while liquidity and FX risk management has become more challenging.
FSAP stress tests conclude that banks are well-placed to handle short-term liquidity stress.
The banking sector dominates the Turkish financial industry, around 90 percent of all
financial services, while insurance services and other financial activities also show
significant growth potential. The FX debt rollover risk of the banking sector remains limited
thanks to the extended maturity of external debt on the back of the amendments in reserve
requirement ratios that are inversely related to the maturity of liabilities, and the
improvement in the diversification of banks’ external funding across countries as well as
long lasting relationships with creditors. The financial sector’s profitability, which has been
on the rise driven by the rebound in net interest income and the decline in non-interest
expenditures, will benefit from the revisions in the general provision rates in consumer loans
and credit cards5.
While the non-financial corporate sector’s (NFCs) debt burden has been elevated, FX
assets and the composition of the FX debt provide room to weather exchange rate
volatility. NFCs’ FX debt is mostly concentrated in a number of sectors including
transportation, energy, construction and health which either generate FX revenues or provide
services under the state-guaranteed PPP projects. Moreover, the maturity of FX loans has
lengthened (over five years for the majority of loans) and firms’ short-term FX positions are
balanced. Additionally, the authorities have been working on a set of macro-prudential
measures based on a well-structured methodology. This tool would facilitate hedging FX
risks and help the non-financial corporates to be more resilient to potential shocks.
Some macro-prudential measures on consumer lending have been calibrated to
revitalize domestic demand and thereby lower the risks to financial stability. A revision

in macro-prudential measures is expected to help the recovery in credit growth, which has
been subdued in the last three years.
The Turkish authorities are aware of the challenges weighing on the Turkish financial
sector. The policy reaction to these challenges has predominantly been structural reforms
such as developing money and capital markets, diversifying instruments, extending
maturities and enhancing capacity and transparency. In this respect, the Turkish authorities
very much appreciate the FSAP, took note of its recommendations and will take them into
consideration to enhance the soundness of the Turkish financial market.
VII.

Structural Reforms

The structural reform agenda is key to achieve high, sustainable and inclusive growth,
to raise the national savings rates, to contain the current account deficit and reduce the
reliance on external financing, to increase labor force participation and quality and
productivity and to improve the rule of law. The government has announced the structural
reform program in both 10th Development Plan and the 2017–2019 MTP and has introduced
the following reforms in 2016:


Boosting domestic savings: The government initiated a budgetary subsidy to savings
account holders that have at least 3 years for the first house and/or for their marriage.
Additionally, the new private pension automatic enrollment system will help stimulate
total savings and contribute to the rebalancing.6
Incentivizing Research and Development (R&D): The minimum headcount
requirement for setting up an R&D company was reduced; the duration of government
subsidies to researcher salaries was extended to 2 years and tax exemption was granted to
these companies. The new Patent Law was ratified by the Parliament in December as
well.
Improving judicial processes: Istanbul Arbitration Centers and Appeals Courts were
established, Expert Witness Act and Intellectual Property Act were enacted, which will
help further improve the business environment by enhancing the quality of judicial
system.
Enhancing the business climate: The authorities have focused on legislative
amendments to simplify the administrative and bureaucratic procedures and provide
project-based incentives that will lower the tax burden on investment spending, support
innovative high-tech projects, deepen the capital markets and strengthen the formal
economy. The government has also introduced new regional investment incentive
schemes to establish investment hubs in the eastern and southeastern provinces.

The specific design features of the reform were discussed extensively with stakeholders and are based on
international best practices, country specific circumstances, institutional capacities and market conditions. The
government has the authority to increase the contribution rates, if deemed necessary going forward.

Additionally, leveraging public procurement will be utilized to increase localization in
potential industries.
Enhancing the access of SMEs to bank loans: A new regulation was enacted for
collateral registries for movable assets, enabling SMEs to provide their all movable assets
as collateral.
Improving the labor market conditions: The flexible employment mechanism was
added to the Labor Code to support employment; Private Employment Agencies were set
up; maternity rights, access to childcare facilities and part-time work allowance for
women until their children reach the age of entry into formal schooling were enhanced to
increase female labor force participation; and provision of relevant skill training and
effective internship programs implemented. The authorities acknowledge that more
progress is needed on the severance pay reform, which requires broad-based
consultations with relevant stakeholders in order to support the successful
implementation.
Improving the SOE governance: The authorities have also been working on the SOE
governance in order to align the governance structure of the SOEs with international best
practices and help these enterprises better compete with private companies.
Reforming the Turkish Development Bank: The Turkish Development Bank, in
collaboration with some key international stakeholders, is undergoing a restructuring
process to enhance the corporate capacity and competitiveness in line with international
best practices.

Further reforms are planned. Looking ahead, the government is going to establish an
Academy for Teachers, develop vocational and technical training to increase the skill sets of
the labor force, implement school-based budgeting, provide better foreign language training
and compulsory pre-school. Furthermore, tax and expenditure reviews will be the backbones
of the fiscal management reforms. Treasury’s commitment to Credit Guarantee Funds will be
raised to TRY 25 billion, which could be leveraged up by the Banks to TRY250 billion, from
its current commitment level of TRY 2 billion. This step is going to improve the access to
finance Turkish SMEs. To enhance entrepreneurship and access to finance, Turkey has also
recently introduced the business angel scheme, and is working on the launch of the
crowd-funding system.
The authorities broadly share staff’s views on rising labor costs, competitiveness, and
refugee integration. The temporary minimum wage government subsidy is appropriate and
fiscally manageable. The integration of refugees into the workforce remains critical and
requires strong international commitment.
VIII. Conclusion
Turkey has preserved its resilience to both external and internal shocks mostly owing to its
solid macroeconomic fundamentals and sound macro-framework. The prudent fiscal position
with sustainable low debt, sound monetary policies and a strong financial sector with a solid
regulation and supervision framework have been the major pillars. Its open and large
economy, dynamic private sector, diversified economy, young and dynamic demography
together with its committed institutions have been supportive under high uncertainties. The

9
Turkish government and authorities are aware of the longstanding structural problems and
continue to show their strong commitment to resolve them with ambitious structural reforms.
We believe that the staff reports could have been more explicit about these factors to draw a
more balanced picture of the Turkish economy.
