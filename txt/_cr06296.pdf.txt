EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
An economic boom initiated by expansion in the aluminum sector has generated large and
growing imbalances in the current account, aggregate demand, and inflation. During the
upswing, the balance sheets of Icelandic banks grew notably. Early in the year, international
markets became concerned that the macro imbalances and the rapid pace of banks’ growth
had generated vulnerabilities that could threaten financial stability should the imbalances
unwind sharply. Both monetary and fiscal policy have been tightening, but monetary policy
has done the largest share.
Key policy issues
Outlook and Risks: Growth is forecast to remain robust and imbalances persist for the
remainder of 2006, but moderate in 2007. Domestic demand is projected to remain the driver
of growth generating a still large current account deficit in 2006. However, imbalances are
expected to moderate in 2007 with investment returning to a normal level and private
consumption contracting. Inflation is forecast to remain well above the 2½ percent target
over the next year and a half. Views differ regarding the risks to the outlook, with staff and
the central bank concerned that in the absence of decisive and coordinated policy actions,
financial market turbulence could lead to a sharp and severe downturn. The fiscal authorities,
however, saw this risk as low, given their view that market turbulence early in the year
reflected a temporary misreading of Iceland’s fundamentals.
Fiscal policy: Given concerns over the resolution of imbalances and the associated impact on
the real economy and the financial sector, staff see a strong case for a tighter-than-budgeted
fiscal stance in 2006 and, if warranted, in 2007. The authorities perceive less need to take
urgent fiscal action in 2006, but see some scope for tightening in 2007 should the economy
not cool as required.
Monetary policy: There is consensus that the policy rate will need to rise further to contain
expectations and return inflation to target. Expeditious reform of the state-owned Housing
Financing Fund is viewed by all to be essential to increase the effectiveness of monetary
policy, though staff consider the initial proposal to fall short of what will be required.
Financial sector: Although traditional indicators of financial sector health suggest the banks
remain sound, the rapid expansion of their balance sheets has increased key risks in liquidity,
credit, and interconnectedness through crossholdings of equity. However, banks have taken
considerable steps to ensure their liquidity requirements are met; credit quality has remained
high; and crossholdings of equity are being reduced. This notwithstanding, the process needs
to continue to further reduce risks.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
An economic boom initiated by expansion in the aluminum sector has generated
large and growing imbalances. During the upswing, the current account deficit widened
appreciably and the balance sheets of Icelandic banks grew tremendously. Early in the year,
international markets became concerned that the macro imbalances and the rapid pace of
banks’ growth had generated vulnerabilities that could threaten financial stability should the
imbalances unwind sharply.
II. BACKGROUND
2.
Over the last three years, a rapid expansion in domestic demand has
dramatically widened the current account deficit (Tables 1–2, Figure 1). Following a
3 percent increase in 2003, GDP growth jumped to 8.2 percent in 2004, and slowed only
modestly to 5½ percent in 2005. With the expansion being stimulated by new investment
projects in the aluminum sector, a rapid pickup in investment was expected. However, the
response of consumption surprised on the upside. The stimulus to household income and
confidence was amplified by income tax cuts and increased competition in the mortgage
market. The current account deficit reached 16½ percent of GDP in 2005, double the initial
forecast, with the bulk of the surprise reflecting increased imports of consumption goods.
Roughly one-third of the deficit reflects the new investment projects.

estimated peak in the late 1990s. During this upswing, temporary work visas have made it
easier for firms to utilize imported labor and labor market participation remained strong.
However, this has not prevented the unemployment rate from falling below 1½ percent, and
reported vacancies remain high. CPI inflation has been persistently above the central bank’s
4 percent upper tolerance limit. Inflation has been driven by house price rises that more than
offset the effect of earlier currency appreciation and rapid increases in service prices. In light
of labor productivity developments, wage inflation of over 8 percent is well above the rate
consistent with the central bank’s inflation target. Limited pass-through of exchange rate
appreciation into import prices over the last half of 2005 suggests that pressures on capacity
are high. Equity prices rose more than 50 percent in each of the last three years.
4.
Monetary policy has tightened, but, until recently, the impact has been
channeled primarily through the exchange rate (Figure 4). In response to growing
inflationary pressures, the policy rate was increased from 5.3 percent in May 2004 to
12¼ percent at end-June 2006. However, households and firms have not felt the full impact
of the tightening and bank credit growth has accelerated. Benign conditions in global
financial markets enabled some firms to borrow at low foreign rates, and real mortgage rates
declined. Also, through early February, the currency appreciated in response to interest rate
spreads, focusing the impact of the tightening on the export sector. However, the market
turbulence that set in thereafter has led effective lending rates to better reflect the policy rate.

6.
Against the background of accumulating imbalances, a series of negative reports
from ratings agencies and analysts stoked market concerns early this year (Figure 5). In
mid-February, a report from Fitch Ratings changed the outlook on sovereign debt from stable
to negative, citing concerns over widening macro imbalances and vulnerabilities in the highly
leveraged financial sector. Some additional negative reports followed, heightening the
sensitivity to loss among leveraged investors (global carry trades) as global monetary policy
conditions tightened (Box 1). Consequently, the exchange rate depreciated, the equity market
declined, banks’ bond prices fell, and spreads widened—all by appreciable amounts.

Box 1. Icelandic Financial Markets in a Global Context
In the first half of 2006, financial market participants became increasingly concerned about several countries
with high-yielding currencies, at times citing their external positions as worrisome. Countries frequently
mentioned by analysts include Iceland, New Zealand, Turkey, Brazil, and Indonesia. The timing of
movements across countries suggests that Iceland and New Zealand may have simply been the first countries
to feel the impact of those concerns, possibly reflecting their large external imbalances. In Iceland and New
Zealand the depreciations and stock market declines started in February. However, in Turkey, Brazil and
Indonesia, they occurred mostly in May, in the context of a broader re-assessment of vulnerabilities and
asset valuations in emerging market.

The financial market turbulence early in the year ended the favorable conditions
that had allowed banks to fund rapid balance sheet growth (Figure 6 and Table 3). High
levels of capitalization, strong profitability, and low default rates resulted in high credit
ratings for Icelandic banks. With benign global financial market conditions, banks were able
to significantly increase foreign liabilities, with a large portion reflecting banks’ acquisition
of financial firms in Europe. Although this expansion diversified banks’ income
streams,concerns about the resolution of Iceland’s imbalances and tightening global credit
conditions raised doubts about banks’ near-term prospects (Box 2). In particular, concerns
centered on their ability to refinance liabilities falling due over the remainder of 2006 and
2007.

Box 2. Icelandic Banks’ Foreign Expansion and its Impact on their Risk Profile1
The rapid foreign expansion of Icelandic banks in 2004-05 diversified revenues and added deposit base.
Banks achieved record profitability in 2006Q1, despite the financial turmoil, partly due to foreign
subsidiaries’ performance.

But risks have also increased. First, banks’ reliance on wholesale funding has increased considerably
owing to some foreign acquisitions that are wholesale-funded, increasing banks’ refinancing risks.
Second, integrating newly acquired businesses could be challenging in a lesser known environment,
which complicates managing credit risk and market risks.
To mitigate such risks, the Financial Supervisory Authority (FME) has signed Memoranda of
Understanding with host supervisors to enhance cooperation and information sharing. Moreover, the
FME has also conducted onsite supervision in select subsidiaries. Based on FSAP recommendations, the
FME now requires banks to report on their policies and procedures for identifying and controlling
country risk in their international lending and investments.

Fiscal policy was tightened in 2005, but remained less restrictive than during the
last cycle (Figure 7 and Table 4). The general government balance moved from a deficit of
almost 2 percent of GDP in 2003 to a surplus of roughly 3 percent of GDP in 2005.
Approximately half of the 2005 surplus reflects unexpectedly higher tax receipts, buoyed by
the consumption and housing market booms. In cyclically-adjusted terms, a deficit of
1 percent of GDP in 2004 swung to a surplus of roughly 1 percent of GDP in 2005. However,
given the magnitude of the cycle, fiscal policy has not been as restrictive in level terms as it
was in the previous cycle because of income tax cuts and nominal public consumption
growth in excess of 8 percent in 2005.

Box 3. Implementation of Past Fund Policy Advice
The authorities have generally pursued policies consistent with Fund advice in structural, financial, and
monetary policy areas. There has been, however, more resistance to Fund advice on fiscal policy.
The 2001 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) served as the basis for strengthening the
financial supervisory legal framework and established standards for controlling and managing risk in the
payments system. Following the 2005 consultation, the central bank introduced changes to its
communication strategy and the Financial Supervisory Authority increased the breadth and stringency of
its stress tests, both consistent with Fund advice.
On fiscal policy, introducing multi-year spending targets into the budget was consistent with Fund
advice on strengthening the fiscal framework. However, there has been considerably less agreement with
the advice on the appropriate cyclical fiscal stance. Further, the authorities have been reluctant to follow
Fund advice on reforming the state-owned HFF, the largest mortgage lending institution in Iceland. The
HFF reform process has only recently been initiated.

III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
9.
Given concerns over the resolution of imbalances and the associated impact on
the real economy and the financial sector, discussions focused on the policies to help
ensure a soft landing and financial stability. There was agreement that the increased
flexibility and sound structural fundamentals of the Icelandic economy were aspects that
stood to aid the benign resolution of the current imbalances. However, staff stressed that the
heightened level of concern in financial markets and the real costs associated with a hard
landing made it imperative that policy actions be taken to stabilize confidence, and help
ensure an orderly adjustment and maintain financial stability. Accordingly, discussions
focused selectively on the following imperative policy priorities:
•

the needed contribution of fiscal restraint, and in particular, the prospects for
achieving a tighter-than-budgeted fiscal stance in 2006 and, if warranted, beyond;

•

the path for the policy interest rate required to return inflation to target without a
larger than necessary slowing in economic activity; and

•

the authorities’ role in strengthening the financial sector and ensuring speedy reform
of the HFF.

10.
Although there was broad agreement in many areas, there were key differences
between staff and fiscal authorities who saw less need for a tightening in fiscal policy.
The official view on fiscal policy reflected a lower estimate of excess demand, constraints on
implementing a tighter stance, and a perception that the market turbulence early in the year
was driven by misinformation that had subsequently been corrected.

13
A. Outlook and Risks
11.
In both the authorities’ and staff’s baseline projection, growth is likely to remain
robust and imbalances persist for the remainder of 2006, but moderate in 2007
(Table 5). GDP growth is expected to be in the range of 4 to 5 percent in 2006 and 1 to
2 percent in 2007. The completion of the aluminum sector projects and continued strong
private consumption are seen to be the drivers of growth in 2006. Accordingly, despite some
improvement, the strength in domestic demand is projected to generate a still large current
account deficit in 2006 (12½ percent of GDP versus 16½ percent of GDP in 2005). However,
with investment returning to a normal level and private consumption contracting due to
exchange rate depreciation and tightening credit conditions, domestic demand is projected to
fall in 2007, cutting the current account deficit by more than half. In 2007, export growth due
to increased aluminum production and a more favorable exchange rate is forecast to
rebalance growth and contribute to the improvement in the current account.

12.
Although there was broad agreement that inflation would remain above the
central bank’s target over the next year and a half, the fiscal authorities forecast less
persistence. Staff and the central bank see exchange rate depreciation, and pressures in
goods and labor markets keeping CPI inflation well above the 2½ percent target. However,
reflecting different assumptions about how quickly aluminum sector investment should be
added to productive capital,1 the fiscal authorities estimate less excess demand. In addition,
they saw less pressure on wages, assuming a more favorable outcome to the potential
revisiting of the wage agreement in November2 and expecting labor market pressures to ease

flows to the capital stock only after the associated plant and equipment has become fully productive.
2

The multi-year wage agreement contains the provision to revisit previously agreed wage increases should
inflation persistently exceed the central bank’s 4 percent upper tolerance limit, as is the case this year. At the
end of June, the social partners agreed to keep the wage agreement in force given the government’s
commitment to change to the personal exemption for income tax. The change will be financed by reducing the
2007 cut in the income tax rate from 2 percentage points to 1 percentage point.

14
following the opening of the labor market to the new EU member states on May 1, 2006.
Most of the mission’s stakeholders projected that house price appreciation, which until
recently had been the key driver of inflation, would moderate as mortgage credit conditions
tighten and housing supply increases. Few saw a significant risk of house price declines.
13.
There were notable differences in views regarding the risks to the outlook. In the
absence of decisive and coordinated policy actions that cool the economy and re-anchor
confidence, staff saw significant risks that further financial market turbulence could lead to a
sharp and severe downturn, a concern shared by the central bank. While in an uncertain
environment various scenarios are possible, the main concern was that financial market
discomfort, given imbalances and their potential impact on a perceived vulnerable financial
sector, could spark tightening in banks’ liquidity conditions and rapid currency depreciation.
This in turn could force the banks to curtail domestic credit growth abruptly. Consequently,
the contraction in domestic demand could be amplified, with negative implications for
incomes and second-round affects on banks. With inflation receiving further stimulus from
currency depreciation, the central bank would be forced to sustain tighter monetary
conditions longer, resulting in a prolonged period with output below potential. The fiscal
authorities, however, saw this risk as low, given their view that market turbulence primarily
reflected a temporary misreading of Iceland’s fundamentals.
B. Fiscal Policy
14.
Although some merit was seen in tightening the fiscal stance over the remainder
of 2006, the authorities pointed to several factors that would make it difficult. With
imbalances larger than expected at the time of the 2006 budget, staff recommended that

15.
The authorities saw some scope for tightening the fiscal stance in 2007. Staff
advised that an announcement be made that the 2007 budget would contain measures to
reduce aggregate demand should the economy not cool as required. Staff pointed to delaying
planned income tax cuts, slowing public consumption growth and reducing the pickup in
public investment as possibilities. The authorities noted that the latter possibility was indeed
being considered and talks to this end were underway.3 While reiterating that the 2007 tax cut
would come when domestic demand was expected to be contracting, they noted that the cut
could be modified to help avoid an inflationary change to the multi-year wage agreement.
16.
The authorities noted that the fiscal framework had been improved in a number
of ways and did not see much scope for further strengthening in the near term. Building
on previous mission work, staff noted how a rules-based fiscal policy delivering a
consistently countercyclical fiscal stance could contribute to stabilizing the Icelandic
economy (Box 4). Because of the large economic shocks in Iceland, it is more important than
in other industrial countries that fiscal policy strongly reinforce monetary policy. The
authorities agreed in principle, and argued that the current framework, with multi-year
spending targets and countercyclical adjustments to public investment, was a “quasi” fiscal
rule. However, they acknowledged that generating the three-year spending targets using the
central bank’s inflation target rather than their inflation forecast would increase the counter
cyclicality of fiscal policy, transparency, and accountability. Nevertheless, because of the
strong indexing culture in Iceland, building the political consensus for such a change would
take time. However, the authorities expressed interest in working with staff to develop a
range of feasible rules-based frameworks.

3

On June 27 the government announced a reduction in public investment in 2007 close the amount suggested
by staff. Further, the maximum loans and loan-to-value ratios at the government-owned HFF were also reduced.

Box 4. Rules-based Fiscal Policy and Inflation and Output Variability in Iceland

Systematic coordination of monetary and fiscal
policy, however, could help improve the trade-off.
The introduction of a simple fiscal rule designed to
simultaneously ensure a consistently
countercyclical fiscal stance and achieve a stable
public debt target shifts the efficient frontier
toward the southwest, reducing inflation, output,
interest rate, and exchange rate variability.1

C. Monetary Policy
17.
The tightening in monetary policy over the last year was jointly viewed as
appropriate, but mortgage market developments had limited its impact on domestic
demand. With inflation persistently above the central bank’s 4 percent upper tolerance limit,
monetary conditions needed to tighten. However, competition in the mortgage market
between the banks and the HFF kept real mortgage rates low and loan conditions easy.
Consequently, the increase in the policy rate was prevented from having a significant impact
on household credit conditions. There was agreement that reform of the HFF would help
restore a more traditional transmission mechanism for monetary policy and thereby improve
its effectiveness. However, with predominantly long-term fixed-real-rate mortgages that
amortize inflation surprises over the remaining term, the policy rate was likely to be less
effective than in other countries having largely shorter-term, nominal-rate mortgage
contracts. Nonetheless, it was thought possible that following effective HFF reform,
mortgage contracts could evolve to give the policy rate greater impact on household credit
conditions.4

4

Even in the current market, some banks have introduced mortgages which reset the interest rate every five
years.

17
18.
The authorities outlined the initial proposal for reforming the HFF; however,
banks expressed strong reservations to which staff were sympathetic. The proposal
involved a new state-owned entity that would raise funds, design mortgage products, and
control credit approval. Banks would sell these products under their own brands, and bear the
credit risk during the initial few years of the mortgage. The banks expressed their desire for
the state to withdraw from the mortgage market, wind down the HFF, and create a new
privately held wholesale financing entity. Such a system would allow them to retain the
mortgages on their balance sheets, design products they felt best suited the market, and retain
loan approval authority.
19.
There was consensus that the policy rate would need to rise further to contain
expectations and return inflation to target over a reasonable horizon. With additional
inflationary pressures expected from currency depreciation, and tight goods and labor
markets, it was agreed that the central bank needed to act decisively to raise real interest rates
and anchor expectations. ISK Euro bonds maturing in the last quarter of the year were
anticipated to weaken the currency and there were no strong indicators that demand pressures
were starting to ease. Given the very high output costs of re-anchoring inflation at target once
high inflation becomes entrenched in expectations, there was broad agreement that, at this
juncture, the central bank should be biased toward a tight monetary stance. Following the
mission, the central bank raised its policy rate by 75 basis points, and markets expect
additional increases will be forthcoming.
20.
The authorities viewed the introduction of the preannounced schedule for
monetary policy meetings as successful and stressed that the framework would continue
to evolve. It was noted that the preannounced policy meetings had enhanced internal
procedures and communication, and helped anchor expectations. There was some agreement
with staff’s suggestion of having more than 6 preannounced meeting per year, particularly
when the time comes to ease policy. Smaller, more frequent steps might allow for more
caution. Further, the response has been favorable to the authorities’ public discussions of
their assessment of the interest rate adjustment necessary to return inflation to target. They
expect the presentation of this assessment to become more detailed and explicit as their
experience increases. The authorities expressed disagreement with the Mishkin and
Herbertsson report5 recommendation to alter the way house prices enter the inflation target.
The authorities argued, and staff concurred, that house price inflation is often a leading
indicator of general inflationary pressures and cannot be ignored. Further, the wide use of
headline CPI inflation in indexed contracts means that it is the appropriate index to stabilize
from a welfare perspective. However, research will proceed, as staff previously advised, to
identify less volatile indices that include house prices and are highly correlated in the

medium-term with headline CPI. Once headline CPI inflation has been re-anchored at the
target rate, it would then be appropriate to consider alternatives.
D. Competitiveness
21.
There was agreement that the year-to-date depreciation in the currency was an
appropriate adjustment from an overvalued level. Although the depreciation, reflecting
market forces, occurred sooner and faster than expected, the currency is now close to most
observers’ estimate of equilibrium. Despite the high degree of uncertainty associated with
such estimates, particularly in a country undergoing such large structural changes as Iceland
(Box 5), there is broad consensus that the equilibrium for the nominal effective exchange rate
(ISK) index lies between 125 and 140. Given the magnitude of imbalances in the economy,
most observers expect some undershooting of the exchange rate before it stabilizes in the
medium term. The export sector, which has become adept at adjusting to currency
Box 5. The Equilibrium Exchange Rate in Iceland
The recent sharp widening of the current account balance in Iceland has raised concerns about the country’s
long-term external sustainability. Using the estimated parameters from Chinn and Ito (2005), the current
account balance consistent with long-run balances in saving and investment in Iceland lies in the range of -½
to -1½ percent of GDP.1 A simple regression of the changes in the current account balance and the real
exchange rate suggests that the real exchange rate would need to depreciate by roughly 10-15 percent to bring
down the deficit to the level implied by the S-I norm. Such adjustment could take the form of lower inflation
or depreciation in the nominal exchange rate, but assuming that inflation will decline to target, the implied
equilibrium rate for the nominal ISK exchange rate index would need to be in the range of 125-140 (at the
end of June the ISK index stood at 130). However, estimating the equilibrium exchange rate entails large
uncertainties. This is in part attributed to differences in methodology, the choice of variables used as proxies
for the fundamental determinants of the equilibrium rate, and the period studied. Also, the various estimation
approaches are particularly difficult to implement in a country like Iceland, where substantial structural
change in recent years make underlying economic relationships unstable. Moreover, it is not clear whether
such adjustment will stabilize the ratio of net foreign assets to GDP given the growing role played by banks’
assets in the Iceland’s net IIP position.

fluctuations, will nevertheless receive a needed boost to profitability. In turn this should spur
investment, further improving competitiveness.
22.
Although there are pockets of support, euro adoption is not broadly viewed to be
viable for Iceland. The authorities noted that support for euro adoption only arises during
periods of market stress. Even those currently in favor see it as part of a medium-term rather
than a near-term strategy. Those opposed argue that the probability is quite low that euro area
monetary policy would ever be set appropriately for Iceland’s cyclical conditions. For
example, it was noted that the current boom could have been much larger if Iceland had
enjoyed euro area interest rates.
E. The Financial Sector
23.
There was consensus that banks’ rapid expansion had increased their risk
profile, but measures have and should continue to be taken to make those risks
manageable (Box 6). The authorities shared staff’s view that the key risks in the banking
sector were liquidity, credit, and interconnectedness through crossholdings of equity. The
discussions revealed the following:
•

banks have taken considerable steps to ensure their liquidity requirements are met
(see Box 6 for details);

•

credit quality has remained high and appears robust to large movements in exchange
and interest rates; and

•

crossholdings of equity are being reduced and associated connected lending is
monitored closely by supervisors.

Despite the steps banks have taken, there was broad agreement among staff, supervisors, and
banks that the process needs to continue. In particular, banks must further diversify their
funding, grow their balance sheets cautiously, be increasingly vigilant regarding credit
quality, and continue to reduce crossholdings of equity.

20

Box 6. Assessment of the Risks in the Icelandic Banking Sector
The mission assessed the vulnerability of the banking system—of which Kaupthing, Landsbanki and Glitnir
represent more than 80 percent—to the main risks: credit, liquidity, and interconnectedness through the
crossholdings of equity.
• Liquidity risk: The high rate of asset growth of banks and a low deposit base imply that banks are heavily
reliant on wholesale funding, mostly from international investors.

The refusal, early in the year, of US money market funds to rollover the banks’ 13-month extendible debts
signaled the likelihood of banks facing higher refinancing costs. Bank bond prices have fallen with spreads
(above EURIBOR) rising to 100bp before settling at 60bp recently. Although all three banks face heavy
refinancing needs in 2006-07, discussions with the banks and the FME suggested that there is no immediate
threat of a liquidity crunch due to lack of market access. Although foreign liabilities maturing in 3-6months are
more than covered by liquid assets (excluding market securities and credit lines), those maturing in
6-12 months are not. However, banks have mostly closed their 2006 funding gap, and have credible plans for
closing 2007 needs. In addition, banks have to meet the central bank mandated liquidity ratio of over 1 in the 03 month horizon and banks have developed foreign exchange liquidity management policies and contingency
plans based on FME guidelines.
The vulnerability to liquidity risks is partly
mitigated by:
• committed back-up facilities, mostly from
European banks;

Box 6. Assessment of the Risks in the Icelandic Banking Sector (cont’d)
If banks used bond issues to close their 6-12 month liquidity gap, the extra refinancing cost is estimated to have
a small impact on profitability—less than ½ percentage point of aggregate return on assets (ROA) at a spread of
100bp.
• Credit risk: Credit growth averaging 44 percent y-o-y 2003-05, in an already deep financial market has
increased the risk that loan quality may have been overestimated. Although default rates and the nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio are low, these are susceptible to rapid increases when the cycle turns.

Private Sector Credit Growth

The FME estimates that the nominal value of NPLs rose by 22 percent y-o-y 2004-05. Being a backwardlooking indicator, the NPL ratio can turn with a down-cycle due to highly leveraged counterparties—private
sector debt/GDP ratio is nearly 200 percent. But, given that most fx loans are made to hedged customers and
most household loan contracts are indexed to inflation, the impact of exchange rate and interest rate changes on
loan quality is expected to be small.
Banks’ exposure to credit risk could be aggravated by the following vulnerabilities, although accompanying
mitigants exist:
• Crossholdings: The complex web of ownership extends to crossholdings by banks of companies they lend
to. This reduces transparency while exposing banks to double-sided risks of being hit on the assets by declining
equity prices of their crossholdings, and on capitalization from possible deterioration of credit quality of the
borrower. However, banks require equity-collateral of 150-200 percent of the loan, with margin calls starting at
140-160 percent (varying by banks). Also, FME deducts equity holdings in financial companies from banks’
regulatory capital. All three banks have started reducing crossholdings and this process needs to continue.
• Connected lending: The FME monitors connected lending through its guidelines and reporting
requirements to ensure loans to connected parties are made on an arm’s length basis. However, the FME does
not have a mandate to set up limits on such loans, to deduct their amounts from capital, or to require banks to
collateralize them.

22
24.
Traditional indicators of financial sector health suggest the banks remain sound.
Stress tests performed by the FME and central bank indicate that bank capital appears
adequate to withstand large shocks (Box 7). Profitability, although having recently been
driven to record highs by gains from equity trading and exchange rate movements, should
remain strong in the absence of these factors. Core profitability has been increasing, in part
reflecting the impact of banks’ foreign expansion.
Box 7. Stress Tests on Solvency of the Banking System
Overall, the banking sector achieved record ROA in 2006Q1, but vulnerabilities have slightly
increased. FME stress tests done quarterly show that the system is resilient to the simultaneous
occurrence of large shocks—increase in write-off of non-performing loans/impaired loans by
20 percent, write-offs of non-mortgage and mortgage loans increasing to their historical highs (1.8 and
0.2 percent respectively), price declines of 35 percent in domestic equities and 25 percent in foreign
equities, fall in marketable bond portfolio by 7percent, and depreciation of the ISK index by
25 percent. Applying the tests on 2005Q4 and 2006Q1 results shows that the post-shock capital
adequacy ratio (CAR) is marginally closer to the 8 percent minimum in 2006Q1 than in 2005Q4. Each
of the bars in the figure show the post-shock effect of each of the tests and all tests together on the
CAR.

The design and magnitudes of the shocks, except the interest rate shock, provide an adequate stress test
of the banking system. The CAR is sensitive to the design of the interest rate shock —duration and
magnitude—on the trading bond portfolio. It would be preferable if the test was based on the likely
change in interest rates along the yield curve as domestic and global monetary policy conditions
tighten, rather than by value of portfolio. To enhance transparency, the assumptions underlying the
stress tests (especially “credit risk 1”) could be discussed more on the website and with the banks.
Encouragingly, the FME has decided not to reduce the stringency of the test following the large
adjustments in markets that have occurred year-to-date.

25.
The supervisory and financial stability frameworks continue to be strengthened.
The FME has now implemented most of the FSAP recommendations including issuing
guidelines on connected lending and monitoring of country risk. Consistent with previous
Article IV recommendations, capital-adequacy stress tests have been broadened and made
more stringent. The central bank and the FME have strengthened their cooperation and

23
recently undertook a joint contingency exercise simulating various stress scenarios. Early in
the year, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed by the relevant ministries, the central
bank, and the FME on consultation concerning financial stability and contingency plans in
the event of severe stress.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
Although current imbalances need to be addressed resolutely, the medium-term
outlook for the Icelandic economy remains highly favorable. At the current juncture,
mounting imbalances in the current account, excess demand, and inflation, plus the
associated threats to stability are concerns that policymakers must address promptly.
However, the structural fundamentals are sound. Institutions and policy frameworks are
strong. Markets are open and flexible, and the skillful management of the country’s natural
endowments has diversified the economy and helped to ensure sustainability. Further, these
factors are combined with a culture of entrepreneurial dynamism that has led to economic
outcomes that belie the country’s small size.
27.
Although public debt is low and declining, an adjustment to the current fiscal
plan is required to reduce imbalances and avert related risks. Macroeconomic
imbalances that are wider than expected at the time of the 2006 budget have increased the
risk that the economy could experience an abrupt and disruptive contraction. The downturn
could be exacerbated if international financial market conditions become less favorable for
Iceland. On current plans, the fiscal surplus will decline in 2006 relative to what was
achieved in 2005. The high growth budgeted for nominal public consumption should be
reduced and more public investment should be delayed to maintain fiscal restraint in 2006 at
the same level as in 2005. The government ought to announce that additional fiscal restraint
will be introduced in the budget for 2007 if domestic demand pressures do not abate as
required. Areas for potential adjustment include planned tax cuts, public investment, and
public consumption.
28.
The fiscal framework should continue to be strengthened to help reduce the
volatility in the Icelandic economy in the future. The introduction of multi-year budgeting
was the first step along the path to a rules-based framework. The next step is to add more
structure to the budgeting and implementation processes to ensure that fiscal policy provides
consistent and substantial offsets to the fluctuations in private demand that have generated
large swings in economic activity in Iceland. Such a systematic approach to fiscal policy
would consistently reinforce monetary policy and increase economic stability.
29.
Further increases in the policy rate, sufficient to increase real interest rates, will
be required to anchor expectations, and return inflation to target. Although house prices,
which have driven inflation well above target in the recent past, are starting to show some
signs of moderation, rising prices of imported and domestic goods and services are forecast
to keep inflation persistently high for an extended period.

24
30.
Given the high output cost of returning inflation to target should expectations of
high inflation become entrenched, the central bank should be biased toward a tight
monetary stance. There are comforting signs that monetary policy is starting to have more
of an impact on the credit conditions faced by households and firms, and these developments
will need to be monitored carefully to gauge the appropriate degree of monetary restraint.
Moreover, inflation expectations should now be better anchored with the introduction of the
preannounced schedule of monetary policy meetings and the central bank’s open discussion
of the interest rate path required to return inflation to target.
31.
The flexible exchange rate regime, introduced in 2001, has worked well.
Although high domestic interest rates attracted carry trade investors, contributing to
exchange rate variability, domestic agents did not taken significant currency exposure.
Consequently, the depreciation in the exchange rate early in the year, which has moved the
currency close to its equilibrium value, has not adversely affected domestic balance sheets.
32.
The financial system appears sound, but actions should continue to be taken to
reduce vulnerabilities. The balance sheets of Icelandic banks have been growing at a
remarkable pace. International markets are concerned that this pace of growth has exposed
the Icelandic financial system to vulnerabilities that could undermine its health as the
economy adjusts to restore balance. Potential vulnerabilities include considerable near-term
refinancing needs, credit quality, the long-term sustainability of the banks’ presence in the
domestic mortgage market, and the crossholdings of equity. Banks are taking significant
steps to meet their funding needs over the near term. Should systemic issues arise, the
authorities have put in place a consultation process and contingency plans to support
financial stability. In addition, the banks have begun reducing crossholdings of equity,
thereby making ownership structures more transparent. At this point in the economic cycle, it
will also be important for banks to be increasingly vigilant regarding credit quality. Given
global credit conditions, banks need to expand their balance sheets more cautiously than in
the recent past and diversify their funding. Stress tests performed by the central bank and the
FME suggest that banks’ capitalization can withstand very large shocks. Should there be a
sharp downturn in the economy, the impact would likely show up in reduced profitability
through a reversal of trading gains, higher financing costs, and increases in non-performing
loans.
33.
The continued strengthening of the supervisory framework is welcome. For
example, the broadening and increased stringency in the stress tests should provide positive
assurance for international markets, as should the banks’ willingness to make the bank-bybank results of these tests public. To further improve the stress tests, the FME should make
the interest rate component more closely match how interest rates along the yield curve
adjust as monetary policy tightens.
34.
The HFF needs immediate reform. The competition between the banks and the
state-subsidized HFF has undermined the effectiveness of monetary policy, unnecessarily

25
exacerbated macroeconomic imbalances, and threatened financial stability. The initial reform
proposal, with continued public ownership, falls short of what is required. Instead, winding
down the existing HFF and creating a new privately-held wholesale funding institution would
retain important economies of scale in mortgage funding and allow for healthy competition
among the banks in the mortgage market. As international experience proves, the social
objective of adequate access to mortgage financing can be achieved with more efficient and
targeted public programs.
35.

It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation occur on the 12-month cycle.

Appendix II: Iceland: External Debt Sustainability
Significant current account deficit, driven by the investment projects coupled with expansion
of Icelandic firms and commercial banks abroad, resulted in a sharp increase of the external
debt (from 143.0 percent of GDP in 2003 to 291.3 in 2005). In net term the level of debt has
risen by about 60 percentage points to 158.1 percent of GDP in 2005. As Table A1 indicates,
in the baseline scenario external debt is projected to stabilize just below 150 percent of GDP.
The alternative scenarios and bound tests indicate that while various shocks could drive the
net external debt to up to 165 percent of GDP, an additional 30 percent depreciation in real
terms could push the level of net external debt to 250 percent of GDP. It should be noted
however, that the baseline scenario already assumes 15 percent depreciation in nominal terms
in 2006.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
August 4, 2006
1. This statement provides an update on developments in Iceland since the circulation of the
staff report to the Board. The new information does not change the thrust of the staff
appraisal, but developments in the external accounts and inflation heighten the risks and
strengthen the case for a more restrictive fiscal stance.
2. Iceland’s external imbalance continues to widen and inflation has accelerated
further. In 2006Q1, imports grew by 17.5 percent while exports shrunk by 7.5 percent,
doubling the current account deficit with respect to a year earlier. Monthly trade data
suggest that this trend continued in the second quarter with June’s trade deficit reaching a
record level. Annual CPI inflation reached 8.4 percent in July, while wages posted
8.8 percent year-on-year growth in June. However, the housing market, which had been a
key driver of inflation, has started to cool. Reykjavik’s housing price index rose by
0.6 percent in June bringing the 3-month rate of change down to 1.6 percent from
4.3 percent the previous three months.
3. The Central Bank responded by raising its policy rate. The policy interest rate was
increased by 75 basis points to 13 percent on July 6 and an additional policy setting
meeting has been announced for August 16. Market participants expect the policy rate to
rise following the meeting and possibly reach 14.5 percent by the end of the year.
Exchange rate movements since the issuance of the staff report have been more
contained: as of August 2, the ISK nominal effective exchange rate index had appreciated
by slightly under 3 percent relative to the last observation of June 12 presented in the
staff report.
4. The government has announced planned measures to reduce demand pressures in
the economy. The maximum loan-to-value ratio on loans issued by the Housing Finance
Fund (HFF) has been temporarily decreased from 90 to 80 percent and the HFF’s loan
limits have been temporarily reduced from ISK 18 to 17 million. Tenders and
commencement of new central government investment projects will be postponed and
discussions are underway with local governments to reduce investment this year and
next. Some local governments have announced plans to do so. This is being done against
the background of an improving fiscal position. In the first quarter of 2006, the general
government financial balance rose to a surplus of 1.5 percent of annual GDP (against
0.7 percent a year ago).
5. The Government, trade unions, and the employers’ confederation reached a
consensus to maintain the current wage agreement which could have been canceled
in November 2006 owing to high inflation. To maintain the current wage agreement,
the government has committed to increase the tax-free income threshold by 14 percent
starting in 2007, index this threshold to inflation thereafter, and increase the minimum
wage by 15.7 percent. To finance these changes, the reduction in the income tax rate set
to occur in January 2007 has been reduced to 1 percentage point rather than the
previously planned 2 percentage points.

2
6. Second quarter bank results suggest that profitability remains strong despite losses
on equity holdings. Net earnings of Kaupthing Bank and Landsbanki declined in the
second quarter compared to the first (by 57 and 35 percent correspondingly), while those
of Glitnir increased by 21 percent. However, all the banks reported that their net profits
for the first six months of 2006 have grown relative to the same period a year ago,
although to a different degree (26 percent for Kaupthing Bank, 84 percent for
Landsbanki, and 91 for Glitnir).

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with
Iceland
On August 4, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Iceland.1

Background
Driven by an expansion of the aluminum sector, Iceland is going through an economic boom that
is generating large imbalances. Strong domestic demand, reflecting rapidly growing investment
and private consumption, is overheating the economy and leading to high inflation and record
current account deficits. As global monetary policy tightened early in the year, volatility in Icelandic
financial markets increased as international investors became concerned about the risks
associated with macroeconomic imbalances and potential vulnerabilities in the financial sector.
Following a recession in 2002, economic growth accelerated sharply reaching 8.2 percent in 2004,
slowing only modestly to 5.5 percent in 2005. Pre-announced income tax cuts, an appreciated
exchange rate, and an easing in household credit constraints stimulated private consumption. With
investment also growing rapidly due to the aluminum sector projects, domestic demand posted
growth of 10.5 percent in 2004 and 15.1 percent in 2005. As domestic demand gathered speed,
the trade deficit more than doubled, reaching 12.8 percent of GDP in 2005 and the current account
deficit hit 16.5 percent of GDP. Meanwhile inflation rose to 8.4 percent year-on-year in June 2006,
well above the 4 percent upper bound of Central Bank’s tolerance range.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during
the August 4, 2006 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

2

Monetary authorities responded to growing demand pressures by raising interest rates to
13 percent in July 2006 from 5.3 percent in May 2004. However, until recently, the monetary
tightening impacted economy primarily through an appreciated exchange rate because the
increased competition between the state-owned Housing Finance Fund (HFF) and commercial
banks lowered long-term mortgage rates and increased the availability of household credit.
The fiscal stance also tightened with the general government balance moving to a surplus of
3.2 percent of GDP in 2005 from a deficit of 2.0 percent of GDP in 2003.
In the first half of 2006, a series of negative reports by analysts and rating agents increased
international investors’ concerns about the consequences of Iceland’s macroeconomic imbalances.
As global monetary conditions tightened, investor concerns lead to an unwinding of carry-trade
positions, putting downward pressure on the exchange rate and equity prices, as well as widening
credit spreads for Icelandic banks whose balance sheets had been expanding rapidly.
GDP is forecast to grow by 4.0 percent in 2006, reflecting completion of the investment projects
and continued strong private consumption. However, as investment returns to normal levels and
consumption weakens due to currency depreciation and tighter credit conditions, growth is
projected to fall to 1.0 percent in 2007. Inflationary pressures are expected to persist and further
tightening of monetary policy is likely. The fiscal surplus is projected to decline slightly, although
steps, undertaken mid year, to postpone additional public investment projects should improve the
fiscal balance relative to that previously expected as well as help ease demand pressures. The
current account deficit is forecast to remain high in 2006 (12.5 percent of GDP) and then improve
sharply in 2007 (4.4 percent of GDP) as growth rebalances toward the export sector reflecting, in
part, increased aluminum-sector capacity and a more competitive exchange rate.

Executive Board Assessment
The Executive Directors noted that, while medium-term prospects are favorable, large and
growing imbalances, evidenced by current account and inflation developments, pose risks to
real growth and financial stability in the short term. Thus, Directors welcomed measures taken
to curb demand pressures, including those recently announced, but they called for further
decisive policy actions to stabilize confidence, help ensure an orderly adjustment, and
maintain financial stability.
Directors emphasized that, despite low and declining public debt, further fiscal restraint,
beyond current plans, is essential to reducing imbalances and averting their associated risks.
The required fiscal tightening could be achieved by some combination of postponing additional
public investment projects and reducing growth in public consumption expenditure. Looking
ahead, Directors stressed that there is a strong case for considering further restraint in the
budget for 2007 if domestic demand pressures do not abate as required.
Directors called for a further strengthening of the medium-term fiscal framework to help reduce
volatility in the Icelandic economy. They observed that the introduction of multi-year budgeting
was the first step along the path to a rules-based multi-year framework. Adding more structure
to the budgeting and implementation processes will ensure a consistently countercyclical fiscal
stance that would reinforce monetary policy and thereby increase economic stability.

3
Directors agreed that further increases in the monetary policy rate would likely be required to
anchor expectations and return inflation to target. With additional inflationary pressures
expected from currency depreciation, and tight goods and labor markets, real interest rates
needed to rise. In
this context, Directors viewed the recent rate increases as appropriate and welcomed the early
signs that monetary policy is starting to have more of an impact on credit conditions faced by
households and firms. The recent consensus reached by the social partners to maintain the
current wage agreement should also help reduce uncertainty. This notwithstanding, given the
high output cost of returning inflation to target should inflationary expectations become
entrenched, Directors concurred that monetary policy should be biased toward a tight stance.
Directors noted that the flexible exchange rate regime in the context of the inflation-targeting
monetary policy framework has served Iceland well. Although the year-to-date depreciation of
the krona occurred sooner and faster than expected, Directors generally viewed the
depreciation in the currency as an appropriate adjustment toward its equilibrium value.
Directors stressed the importance of actions directed at reducing vulnerabilities in the financial
sector. Despite the strong balance sheets of financial institutions, the banks’ rapid expansion
has increased their risk profile. Directors welcomed the steps banks have taken so far to make
these risks more manageable. Nevertheless, they stressed that the process needs to continue,
with the encouragement and close monitoring of the supervisory authorities.
Directors welcomed the strengthening of the supervisory and financial stability frameworks.
They commended the Financial Supervisory Authority (FME) for quickly implementing broader
and more stringent stress tests, which should provide positive assurance to the markets.
Directors recommended an immediate reform of the Housing Finance Fund. They noted that
the increased competition in the mortgage market between the banks and the state-owned
Housing Finance Fund had undermined the effectiveness of monetary policy, exacerbated
excess demand, and increased the risks to financial stability. Following international
experiences, Directors encouraged the authorities to consider a new privately-held wholesale
funding institution that would retain the positive features of the current system as well as allow
for healthy competition in the mortgage market.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
