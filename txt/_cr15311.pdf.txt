IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Finland

On November 11, 2015 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Finland.
The Finnish economy has been in recession for three years. It has experienced a unique
confluence of structural and cyclical shocks since 2007. Exports have suffered due to the
declines of Nokia and the paper industry, compounded by weak external demand, especially
from the euro area and Russia. Wage hikes in 2008–10 and weak productivity growth have hurt
competitiveness. Rapid population aging is a further drag on growth. As a result, the current
account and fiscal balances have deteriorated, with the 2014 fiscal deficit breaching the Stability
and Growth Pact’s (SGP) 3 percent of GDP criterion.
A modest recovery is projected to begin this year and gradually strengthen in 2016. However,
absent further reforms, growth is likely to remain much lower than pre-crisis. Downside risks
heighten the fragility of the recovery. Weaker-than-expected growth in key trade partners would
be a drag on exports and spillovers from an external financial shock would create tighter
financial conditions, with negative effects on output. Domestically, procyclical fiscal tightening
could weaken the recovery more than already anticipated.
The new government has announced a broad structural reform program, including labor market
and benefits reforms to reduce unit labor costs and improve competitiveness. Pension reforms to
lengthen working careers were recently introduced to Parliament and should help mitigate the
impact of population aging on labor force growth. Reforms to improve public sector productivity
and contain aging related fiscal pressures, especially in health and social services, are being
developed. The government’s medium-term fiscal plan envisages substantial consolidation that
aims to bring the deficit back in line with the SGP criterion next year and begin closing the long-

run fiscal sustainability gap. Legislation passed last year introduced a number of improvements
in financial sector policy, including a new macroprudential policy framework.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted that a confluence of adverse cyclical and structural shocks has sharply
weakened Finland’s economic performance in recent years. While welcoming recent signs of a
modest recovery, Directors underscored that reviving economic growth remains Finland’s central
policy challenge. In this context, they called for strong measures to facilitate the reallocation of
resources between sectors, boost productivity, and raise labor supply. They acknowledged that
Finland’s strengths in different areas can help it tackle these challenges.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ comprehensive structural reform agenda. They highlighted
the recent progress on pension reforms and liberalizing shop opening hours. They noted,
however, that other elements still need to be further developed and implemented. They
emphasized the need to increase the flexibility of the wage bargaining system and curtail the
long duration of unemployment benefits. They noted that this should be done in conjunction with
a strengthening of active labor market programs and urged the authorities to reconsider plans to
reduce funding for these programs. They also cautioned that intended cuts in R&D spending
could weaken medium-term productivity growth. Directors welcomed plans to reform the
delivery of health and social services, but noted that outcomes should be closely monitored to
avoid deterioration in the quality of services.
Directors concurred that fiscal adjustment is needed to close the sustainability gap and comply
with the Stability and Growth Pact. They stressed, however, that this should be balanced with the
need to protect the fragile recovery. In this regard, they agreed that consolidation efforts should
prioritize measures that address aging-related spending pressures, such as health, social services,
and pension reforms. In the short run, they suggested making the composition of fiscal
adjustment more growth-friendly, including by shifting cuts from public investment to
consumption. Many Directors considered that consolidation could be further smoothed by
frontloading some spending from the growth package. A number of Directors, however, viewed
the planned pace of adjustment to be appropriate and cautioned against slowing it. Directors
underscored that automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate if growth disappoints and
that fiscal costs from a significant surge in refugees should be accommodated.
Directors commended the authorities for introducing a new macroprudential policy framework
and implementing the EU’s Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive. They noted that there is
scope to strengthen the macroprudential framework further, including through the introduction of

a systemic risk buffer. They also highlighted the importance of enhancing regional cooperation
on financial stability, supervisory, and bank resolution issues. Directors looked forward to the
coordinated FSAPs for Finland and Sweden in 2016.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
October 26, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Finland has suffered a unique confluence of structural and cyclical shocks. This has
driven the economy into recession for the past three years. The impact on growth and
exports of the parallel structural declines of Nokia and the paper industry has been
exacerbated by weak external demand, including from Russia and the euro area. Wage
hikes in 2008–10 and weak productivity growth have hurt competitiveness. Rapid
population aging is a further drag on growth. Pre-crisis current account surpluses have
become deficits and the fiscal position has deteriorated. The nascent recovery is fragile
and, absent reforms, medium-term growth will be much slower than before the crisis.
Reviving growth is Finland’s central challenge. Policy imperatives include:


Structural reforms. Robust implementation of structural reforms—including in the
areas of wage bargaining, unemployment insurance, ALMPs, and the delivery of
health care—would help facilitate reallocation of labor between sectors, boost
productivity, and raise labor supply growth. The government’s reform program
covers the key issues but needs to be fully developed and vigorously implemented.



Fiscal policy. Fiscal consolidation is needed to address long-term spending
pressures and respect the SGP, but poses risks to growth. The composition of the
consolidation should be made as growth friendly as possible, including by protecting
public investment and delaying hikes in unemployment insurance contributions. The
government’s growth package of one-off investments could partially mitigate the
consolidation’s growth impact, especially if it is made more frontloaded.



Financial sector and macroprudential policies. The new macroprudential
framework should be fully implemented. Further measures, particularly a systemic
risk buffer, would strengthen the framework. Greater coordination between financial
sector supervisors in the region is critical to contain cross-border spillover risks. The
2016 FSAP will provide an opportunity for detailed recommendations.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. Recent Developments
1.
Finland has suffered three years of recession. Though Finland initially bounced back from
the global financial crisis in 2010–11, GDP declined by a cumulative 3 percent in 2012–14 (Table 1).
Both domestic and external demand have been weak

unemployment, which increased to 8.7 percent in
2014, modest wage increases, and already indebted
105
households contributed to a slowdown in private
100
consumption in 2013–14. Weak growth, both at home

dampened firms’ ”animal spirits”, causing private

average in 2013 to 1.2 percent in 2014, with end-of2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015

period inflation at 0.6 percent. The decline is due
largely to falling oil and food prices. The same factors are expected to lower average headline
inflation further to 0.0 percent in 2015, while average core inflation is forecast at around 0.6 percent.
2.
The cyclical headwinds buffeting Finland have coincided with large structural shocks.
The most important shock has been the sharp decline in the ICT sector since 2007, due largely to the
abrupt decline of Nokia’s handset business, which it sold to Microsoft in 2013 (Figure 2). The steep
drop in demand during the crisis also accelerated the secular decline in the paper industry. The
shrinkage of these high productivity industries explains a substantial fraction of the decline in
aggregate productivity growth since 2007. Longer-term structural factors also contribute to
Finland’s growth challenges, especially the rapidly aging workforce and slow labor supply growth.

3.
The current account has shifted to persistent deficits since the crisis. With the exportoriented electronics and wood and paper industries declining, nominal exports have fallen more
than 10 percent from their peak in 2008. With imports only falling 1 percent over the same period,
the trade balance has deteriorated (Figure 3). A wage agreement in 2007 that generated rapid wage
increases in 2008–10 also contributed to a loss of competitiveness just as the crisis struck. As a result
of the wage increases and falling productivity, unit labor costs (ULCs) have risen 25 percent since
2007. Pre-crisis current account surpluses have given way to persistent deficits, causing the net
international investment position to deteriorate (Tables 2 and 3). However, the real effective
exchange rate appears broadly in line with fundamentals (Box 1).

program, including labor market and benefits reforms to reduce unit labor costs and improve
competitiveness. The medium-term fiscal plan envisages a consolidation worth around 2 percent of
GDP over 2016–19. It aims to bring the deficit back in line with the SGP criterion next year and begin
closing the long-run fiscal sustainability gap. A number of financial sector policy reforms legislated
last year, including a new macroprudential policy framework, are now being implemented.

B. Outlook and Risks
6.
The economy’s return to growth will likely be slow. The outlook is for growth of
0.4 percent in 2015 and 0.9 percent in 2016 (down from April 2015 WEO projections of 0.8 and
1.4 percent, respectively). Despite modest nominal wage increases, growth in 2015 is partly driven
by a projected pick-up in private consumption. Consumption growth is supported by lower inflation,
which boosts households’ real purchasing power, and one-off mortgage amortization holidays
offered by major banks (worth about 0.3 percent of GDP in total), which increased discretionary
income in the first half of 2015. Private investment is expected to start contributing positively to
growth in 2016, partly driven by sizable investments

(Billions of euros, quarterly average)
recovery will also be supported by the bottoming

crisis, rising to only 1.6 percent in 2020. By then the

will still be slightly negative. Unemployment is

gradually declining in 2017. Headline inflation is
projected to pick-up again in 2016 to 1.3 percent as the effects of falling commodity prices abate.
While a protracted bout of deflation is therefore unlikely, in the short run low inflation could hamper
relative price adjustments and contribute to households’ debt burdens.
7.
Spillovers from weaker-than-expected external demand, a financial shock, and the
growth impact of fiscal tightening are the main sources of risk (Table 6). Slower growth in key
export partners, including Russia, the rest of the Nordic region, or the euro area, would be a drag on
export growth and likely retard the recovery. Spillovers from a financial shock, whether originating in
the region (e.g., severe housing market decline in one of the other Nordics) or elsewhere in the euro
area (e.g., deeper and more protracted turbulence related to Greece), could be channeled through
Swedish or Danish banks. Such a shock could cause a tightening of financial conditions in Finland,
with a potentially significant impact on investment, consumption, and the housing market.
Domestically, the main risk is that the procyclical fiscal consolidation would weaken the recovery
more than has been accounted for in the baseline (e.g., if fiscal multipliers are higher than expected).

could be positive for labor force growth, but will have short-run fiscal costs.

Authorities’ Views
8.
The authorities saw weaker external demand or financial shocks as the main risks. They
agreed with staff that such shocks had the potential to impair the fragile recovery. They noted,
however, that the drop in exports to Russia last year was sharper than expected and that, given the
scale of the realized decline, any further weakening should have a smaller impact. The authorities
acknowledged that fiscal consolidation will have a negative impact on growth. However, they
thought the likelihood of this being large was low, arguing that most of the conditions that could
increase fiscal multipliers are not significant for Finland. In particular, they noted fiscal multipliers in
small open economies are typically small and that the share of liquidity constrained consumers is
smaller in Finland than in most other euro area countries. Also, interest rates at the zero lower
bound are unlikely to affect multipliers in Finland since, as a small member of a monetary union,
monetary policy does not respond to fiscal policy changes in Finland even in normal times.

POLICY DISCUSSION
9.
Finland’s primary challenge is to revive growth. Tackling this challenge will require bold
and comprehensive structural reforms, including in the labor market, to address low productivity
and labor supply growth. Fiscal policy should balance consolidation needs against growth objectives
to avoid derailing the fragile recovery. The macroprudential policy toolkit and regional cooperation
on financial stability issues should be further strengthened to guard against future risks.

A. Structural Policies: Raising Finland’s Growth Potential
10.
Structural reforms are needed to facilitate resource reallocation between sectors,
boost productivity, and raise labor supply growth. The precipitous decline of once rapidly
growing high-productivity sectors has negatively impacted aggregate labor productivity and total
factor productivity (TFP) growth, with the latter forecast to be only half its pre-crisis average over the
medium-term.1 Reallocating resources from declining industries to growing ones is critical to
restoring growth and raising TFP. Impediments to labor mobility—such as too little affordable
housing in Helsinki and limited retraining opportunities—can hamper this reallocation. Also, the
centralized wage setting system compresses the wage distribution. This constrains firms’ ability to
adjust wages in line with firm-specific productivity developments and effectively causes a relatively
high minimum wage that may make it more difficult for low-skilled workers to find jobs, reducing
participation and raising structural unemployment. Coupled with generous unemployment benefits
(500 days duration), wage compression may have also discouraged skill development that can
facilitate inter-sectoral labor mobility. Meanwhile, labor force growth has fallen sharply as the impact

of population aging has been compounded by a decline in the participation rate of 25–54 year olds
(by 4 percentage points since 2008) and a relatively low participation rate for 65–69 year olds
(13 percent versus 25 percent OECD average).2

competitiveness and raise growth through
both product and labor market reforms.
Additionally, the authorities seek to
improve public sector productivity and

Labor market reforms focus on reducing unit labor costs and raising the labor supply.
Pension reforms, agreed last year, aim to increase the average effective retirement age to 62.4 by
2025 (from 61 years currently). The reforms should slow the decline in labor supply growth and help
address the long-run sustainability gap in public finances. Plans to tighten requirements on student
aid should help reduce very long tertiary study duration and increase labor force participation by
younger people. The government also seeks to reduce unit labor costs, including via a reduction of
employers’ social security contributions and via unremunerated increases in working hours (the

modalities of how the latter is to be achieved are
subject of ongoing discussions with the social
partners). The government has indicated its
intention to increase the flexibility of the wage
bargaining system at the firm-level and appointed
an internal government expert to make specific
proposals to achieve this. Reforms to unemployment
benefits that would trim their generosity and
duration are also planned, but will not be
implemented before 2017.

13.
The reform program also aims to improve public sector productivity, especially in the
provision of health and social services. Measures aimed at reducing bureaucratic requirements
and increasing local governments’ flexibility in service delivery—easing the minimum staff-tochildren ratio in day cares, for example—should increase productivity in the near-term. The planned
reform of the provision of health and social services, however, will be a more complex, medium-term
endeavor. This reform aims to shift responsibility for delivering health and social services from
municipalities to regional bodies to streamline administration, reap economies of scale, and
facilitate the dissemination of best practices.
14.
Measures are also planned to support private sector productivity growth and increase
the availability of housing. A recent proposal to Parliament to liberalize shop opening hours
should help increase competition and have an immediate positive effect on retail sector output and
employment. Other initiatives aim to reduce various administrative and regulatory burdens on
business, including streamlining permitting processes, but many details remain to be specified. Plans

15.
The government’s reform program is promising, but needs to be further developed
and implemented. Staff welcomed the reform intentions, but noted that the effects of key reforms,
including of the wage bargaining system, unemployment insurance, and health and social services,
would depend on their precise modalities and implementation. Thus, the authorities should quickly

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

FINLAND

flesh out the details of their reform agenda. The outcomes of reforms to increase the local
governments’ flexibility in the delivery of services should be closely monitored to ensure they do not
result in lower quality of services. The impact of the pension reform should also be assessed over
time to ensure it is achieving its aims.
16.
The reform program could also be strengthened in some areas. With unemployment
high and rising, active labor market programs (ALMP) should be expanded to increase retraining
and skill development opportunities. Strengthening ALMPs can also help ensure that reforms that
increase labor supply do not lead to higher structural unemployment. The government’s plan to cut
ALMP funding therefore raises concern and should be reconsidered. Direct investment in affordable
housing and related infrastructure in the main urban areas would also support labor mobility
between regions. Similarly, overall public investment in R&D and innovation could be increased (and
should at least be maintained at current levels), as evidence suggests such spending is associated
with faster private sector TFP growth over the medium-term. There is also scope for further product
market reforms, including reducing planning restrictions on real estate developments for retail
locations that can limit market entry and economies of scale.

Authorities’ Views
17.
The authorities agreed with staff on the structural challenges and were determined to
move ahead with planned reforms. The authorities wanted to proceed quickly with reforms but
cautioned that implementing too many measures simultaneously could create resistance and be
counterproductive. In line with Finnish tradition, taking decisions based on broad consensus with
social partners was the government’s strongly preferred option. The authorities were adamant,
however, that they would take required measures even if consensus could not be secured. For
example, after recent efforts to reach a “social contract” with employers and trade unions on a
reduction of unit labor costs had failed, the authorities had introduced proposals to amend
legislation governing collective agreements and bypass trade unions. The authorities fully agreed
with staff on the need for more flexibility in collective wage setting, but believed that radical
changes to the system could prove costly and disruptive. Hence, they are exploring options to
increase firm-level flexibility in wage formation within the broad contours of the existing system,
such as by adding opt-out clauses to collective agreements. The authorities considered the pension
reform that comes into force in 2017 sufficient to put pension expenditure on a sustainable path.
However, they assured staff they will monitor developments and reassess the need for further
reforms at five-year intervals. On ALMP and R&D spending cuts, the authorities indicated that there
was scope to cut less effective programs to help satisfy fiscal consolidation needs.

B. Fiscal Policy: A Difficult Balance
18.
Fiscal consolidation is needed to ensure long-run sustainability and respect SGP rules.
The long-run fiscal sustainability gap is sizable (estimated at around 5 percent of GDP) and is
primarily due to projected aging related spending pressures. Partly due to such pressures, public
expenditure has already increased 12 percentage points of GDP since 2007, suggesting a need to

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FINLAND

begin addressing the sustainability gap now. Also, after breaching of the SGP’s deficit criterion in
2014, fiscal consolidation is needed to ensure the deficit is brought back below the 3 percent
threshold next year and that the public debt-to-GDP ratio is on a downward path by 2020 (see
Appendix I). To address these issues, the new government is planning fiscal adjustment of nearly
2 percent of GDP over 2016–19. While this consolidation generates only a small improvement in the
structural fiscal balance, it prevents a further deterioration of the structural balance (e.g., from rising
aging related spending) that would have occurred without the measures. The consolidation path is
slightly frontloaded, with more than three fifths of the consolidation occurring in the first two years.
The proposed 2016 budget envisages consolidation measures worth about 0.6 percent of GDP.

19.
However, in the short term the consolidation poses a risk to the recovery. Staff’s
projections include the estimated growth impact of consolidation. Assuming a fiscal multiplier of
0.6—the estimated average over the cycle—the consolidation in 2016 is expected to reduce growth
by about 0.3 percentage points relative to the April 2015 WEO projection. However, there is
significant uncertainty around multiplier estimates and the growth impact of the consolidation could
be larger. The impact on growth will also depend on the composition of fiscal adjustment.
20.
The authorities’ consolidation plan is heavily weighted towards spending cuts.
Spending reductions are more than ¾ of the planned consolidation measures over 2016–19.
Education, foreign aid, and social benefits are targeted for some of the most substantial cuts,
though how some of these savings will be achieved remains to be determined. Despite high and
rising unemployment, spending on ALMP will be reduced, while plans to reform unemployment
benefits, generating savings of 0.1 percent of GDP per year, will be delayed to 2017. Public
investment in new projects, such as the City Rail Loop in Helsinki, will be reduced, though these cuts
will be partially offset by increased maintenance of existing infrastructure (see below).
21.
Local governments will be responsible for about 20 percent of the savings. This will be
achieved in part by the central government reducing their responsibilities and allowing them greater
flexibility in the delivery of services. In addition, a General Government Fiscal Plan has been

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

FINLAND

introduced that sets out medium-term spending and deficit limits on both the central and local
governments. However, municipalities have substantial fiscal autonomy under the constitution, and
it is unclear if spending limits at the municipal level can be fully enforced.
22.
On the revenue side, the net impact of envisaged tax policy measures will be small. The
budget proposal includes a hike in unemployment insurance (UI) taxes to generate 0.1 percent of
GDP per year in 2016–17. Other revenue raising measures for 2016–19 include phasing out the tax
deductibility of mortgage interest and excise tax increases. These measures will be largely offset,
however, by lower income, capital, and corporate taxes, including an earned income tax credit
increase worth about 0.2 percent of GDP.
23.
A “growth package” is planned to mitigate the adverse impact of consolidation. Similar
to a comparable package that was introduced in 2014, the growth package consists of one-off
investments in infrastructure maintenance (0.3 percent of 2016 GDP) and other key projects,
including investments in innovation and digitization of government services. In total, the growth
package is worth about 0.7 percent of GDP, with about 0.15 percent of GDP spent in 2016 and
0.3 percent of GDP spent 2017 and 2018 each. Financing for the package comes from a combination
of asset sales, increased dividends from public enterprises, and cuts to new infrastructure projects
(the latter reduce the net impact of the package’s infrastructure component by about half).
24.
Staff supported measures to curb long-term spending pressures, but suggested that
the pace of consolidation could be smoothed to reduce growth risks. For instance, there would
seem to be some scope for a more even consolidation path within the constraints posed by the SGP.
Moreover, frontloading some of the spending from the currently backloaded growth package would
also help reduce the effective fiscal consolidation and ameliorate the growth impact. In particular, it
should be feasible to bring forward some of the planned infrastructure maintenance spending.
Additionally, if growth is weaker than expected, automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate
and fiscal costs from a significant surge in refugees should be accommodated.
25.
The composition of consolidation should also be made as growth friendly as possible.
In the government’s current plan most of the measures on the revenue side shift the tax
composition away from direct (income) taxes towards indirect (consumption) taxes. This should be
beneficial for growth in the medium- to long-run. However, the planned increase in the UI
contribution tax—which is driven by the rules governing the UI fund—increases labor costs at a time
when labor demand is already weak. It would be better to delay this tax increase until
unemployment is closer to normal levels. On the expenditure side, spending on ALMP should be
increased rather than cut, to help reduce high unemployment. Also, planned cuts to productive
public investment and R&D should be avoided, as they are most damaging to growth. Staff’s
analysis suggests that for a given amount of consolidation, shifting cuts from public investment and
targeted transfers to public consumption and untargeted transfers could reduce the negative shortrun effects on output by about one third.3

In the longer-run, structural reforms are essential to contain aging related spending
pressures and ensure fiscal sustainability. The pension reforms that will be legislated this year are

27.
The authorities acknowledged that consolidation posed risks to growth, but felt it was
important to have sufficient buffers to ensure compliance with the SGP. They argued that
savings needed to be locked-in early to make sure the public debt-to-GDP ratio is on a downward
path by 2020. They indicated that the timing of the growth package spending will partly depend on
the availability of financing from planned sources and saw limited scope for frontloading of
investments. The authorities believed that the negative growth impact from cuts to public
investment and R&D in Finland would not be as high as the literature suggests, as the country’s
infrastructure levels and R&D spending were near the frontier. The authorities agreed that reforms
to improve public sector productivity, especially in health and social services, were critical, but noted
that the careful design and implementation of such reforms would take time.

C. Financial Sector Policies: Safeguarding Sustained Stability
28.
There are few indications of imminent domestic financial stability risks. Even after an
extended period of very low interest rates, the banking system remains profitable and appears
relatively well capitalized (Table 7). Also, despite the weak economy, non-performing loans (NPLs)
remain low at 1.5 percent of total loans, having fallen from 1.8 percent at end-2014. Credit to nonfinancial and housing corporations has been growing fairly steadily at around 5 percent in 2014 and
the first half of 2015, while household credit growth has been around 2 percent. The household debt
ratio has risen to about 120 percent of disposable income, which is moderate relative to comparator
countries (Figure 5). Meanwhile, the housing market has cooled and standard metrics suggest that
average house prices are broadly in line with fundamentals.
29.
However, ensuring adequate frameworks to deal with future shocks is key. While
currently healthy, banks’ could still be weakened if very low interest rates continue much longer or if
the projected recovery fails to materialize. Prolonged stagnation and higher unemployment could
also conceivably cause house prices to decline and prompt deleveraging by the most highly

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

indebted households. Moreover, with the economy in a weakened state, financial shocks (including
external ones) could cause particularly severe damage. Conversely, it is also important that the
authorities have an adequate toolset to contain risks once the recovery gathers steam. Important
structural vulnerabilities also remain in the financial sector, including the banking system’s
concentration, regional interconnectedness, and heavy reliance on wholesale funding.
30.
A new macroprudential policy framework was introduced, but there is scope for
further measures. The implementation of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) in
national legislation, including establishing a resolution authority and a new deposit guarantee and
resolution fund is a positive step. In addition, the Act on Credit Institutions passed last year
introduced the macroprudential policy tools required by CRR/CRD-IV, as well as a loan-to-value
(LTV) ratio cap for new mortgages to apply from mid-2016. It also established the independent
Board of the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority (FIN-FSA) as the macroprudential authority.
There is scope to further strengthen the macroprudential toolkit, including adding a systemic risk
buffer (SRB), as recommended by an internal study group. Adding this optional CRD instrument
would better align Finland with the regulatory standards that its large foreign banks face in their
home jurisdictions. In view of banks’ increasing reliance on wholesale funding, which creates
potential funding and liquidity risks, the authorities should implement the Basel III net stable
funding ratio and liquidity coverage ratio requirements as soon as is feasible.

31.
Further enhancing regional cooperation on financial stability issues is also important.
The Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) became the competent microprudential regulator for the
three largest Finnish banks last year. However, as two of these—Nordea and Danske Bank—are
subsidiaries of parent institutions outside of the banking union, the need for close cooperation on
financial stability issues and cross-border resolution frameworks remains. The issue is accentuated
by Nordea’s plans to convert its Finnish subsidiary into a branch. If this materializes, it will be
important that the Finnish authorities retain the capacity to closely monitor this systemically

important bank (which accounts for about 30 percent of loans and deposits in the Finnish banking
system) for the purposes of financial stability risk analysis and macroprudential policy formulation.
Moreover, it would be critical that robust cross-border supervisory cooperation, such as on
information sharing, depositor protection, and resolution arrangements, is agreed between the
relevant Finnish, Swedish, and European authorities.
32.
The 2016 FSAP will provide an opportunity to delve deeper into financial sector issues.
The upcoming Finland FSAP—which will be closely coordinated with the Sweden FSAP—will include
a thorough examination of the financial sector and financial stability risks, as well as an integral
assessment of the regulatory environment.

Authorities’ Views
33.
The authorities agreed that there is scope to strengthen the policy framework. The
authorities supported the working group’s recommendation to introduce a SRB but expected that
this proposal will probably not be taken up before next year owing to the priority of other legislative
proposals. While noting that a framework for regional cooperation on financial sector issues was in
place, the authorities agreed that a deepening of cooperation was useful in view of Nordea’s plans
to convert its subsidiary into a branch. On the latter issue, the authorities voiced concerns about the
potential detrimental consequences on macroprudential policies and microprudential level playing
field, and on resolvability, considering the systemic importance of the Nordea subsidiary in the
Finnish banking sector. The authorities were broadly positive on their experience with the SSM
assuming supervision of the three largest banks, while noting that there had been a learning curve
and that the workload of the FIN-FSA had somewhat increased.

STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
The Finnish economy has been in recession for three years. It has experienced a unique
confluence of structural and cyclical shocks since 2007. Exports have suffered due to the declines of
Nokia and the paper industry, as well as weak external demand, especially from the euro area and
Russia. Wage hikes in 2008–10 and weak productivity growth have hurt competitiveness. Rapid
population aging is a further drag on growth. As a result, the current account and fiscal balances
have deteriorated, with the 2014 fiscal deficit breaching the SGP’s 3 percent of GDP criterion.
35.
The recovery will likely be slow and is subject to significant downside risks. A moderate
recovery is projected to start in 2015 and to gradually strengthen in 2016. However, absent further
reforms, growth is likely to remain much lower than before the crisis. Moreover, downside risks
heighten the fragility of the recovery. Weaker-than-expected growth in key trade partners would be
a drag on exports and spillovers from an external financial shock could cause financial conditions to
tighten, with negative effects on output. Domestically, the procyclical fiscal tightening could weaken
the recovery more than already anticipated. While the recent surge in refugees creates short-run
fiscal risks, over the medium-term it should support labor supply growth.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

FINLAND

36.
The main challenge is to revive growth. Productivity growth has fallen sharply, including
because of changes in the economy’s sectoral composition, and labor supply growth has slowed
owing to population aging. Addressing these issues will require structural reforms to boost
productivity growth, facilitate the reallocation of resources from declining industries to growing
ones, and raise labor participation rates.
37.
The government’s structural reform program is promising, but needs to be further
developed and implemented. The initiative to liberalize shop opening hours is a welcome step that
should have immediate positive impact on output and employment. Proposals to reduce unit labor
costs have the potential to increase competitiveness. The government’s intention to increase the
flexibility of the wage bargaining system and curb the long duration of unemployment benefits are
also welcome and developing concrete proposals in these areas should be a priority. Such reforms
should be paired with a strengthening of ALMP, so current plans to cut ALMP spending seem illadvised. Giving municipalities greater flexibility in delivering services could improve public sector
productivity, but outcomes should be carefully monitored. Increasing spending on R&D, if welltargeted, could raise medium-term growth and plans to cut such spending should be reconsidered.
38.
Fiscal policy should balance consolidation needs against growth objectives. Fiscal
adjustment is needed to close the sustainability gap and to ensure compliance with the SGP, but
poses risks to growth. Consolidation efforts should focus on items that address long-term agingrelated spending pressures, such as health and social services reforms. The pace of the consolidation
could be smoothed to reduce negative growth effects and still respect the SGP. Growth package
spending should be frontloaded. The composition of fiscal adjustment could also be made more
growth friendly by shifting cuts from public investment to consumption. UI contribution increases
raise labor costs at a time when labor demand is already weak and should be delayed until
unemployment is lower. Automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate if growth disappoints
and fiscal costs from a significant surge in refugees should be accommodated.
39.
Financial sector risks appear contained for the moment, but ensuring robust policy
frameworks to deal with future risks is key. With the economy in a fragile state, financial shocks
(including external ones) could be particularly damaging. It is also important that the authorities
have an adequate toolset to contain risks once the recovery gathers steam. The development of a
macroprudential policy framework last year has been a major positive step, but there remains scope
to strengthen the policy toolkit, particularly by adding a SRB. Also, regional cooperation on financial
sector issues should be further enhanced, including to address issues raised by Nordea’s plans to
convert it Finnish subsidiary into a branch.
40.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Finland occur on the standard
12-month cycle.

Box 1. External Sector Assessment
Sizable pre-crisis current account (CA) surpluses have turned into persistent deficits. In the decade up
to 2007, Finland’s annual CA surplus averaged 5½ percent of GDP. Since 2011, however, the CA has shown a
deficit of about 2 percent of GDP. The shift to CA deficits has eroded the net international investment
position (NIIP). The deficit in the current account is balanced by a surplus in the financial account. From
2009–12, positive portfolio debt investments due to Finland’s status as a “safe haven” contributed
substantially to the financial account surplus. In 2014, foreign direct investment became more important as
Microsoft purchased Nokia’s handset business. Portfolio inflows will continue to be an important component
of the financial account, averaging about 6 percent of GDP per year out to 2020.
The CA deterioration is mainly driven by the decline of Nokia and wood and paper exports. Exports of
electrical and optical equipment have fallen from their pre-crisis peak of 8½ percent of GDP to 3 percent in
2014. Wood and paper exports have declined more steadily, by about 2½ percentage points of GDP since
2002 to 5½ percent in 2014. These declines have only been partially mitigated by rising exports from other
industries, such as chemicals, so Finland’s share of global exports has declined (see Figure 3, lower left
panel). This has been exacerbated by ULCs rising nearly 25 percent since 2007, due to a mix of rapid wage
increases during 2008–10 and falling productivity as result of the sectoral changes in the economy.
However, exports appear to be stabilizing and the trade balance is expected to move back into
surplus. As a result, the CA balance is expected to improve by a cumulative ½ percent of GDP to -0.2
percent in 2020. Given continued CA deficits, the NIIP is forecast to continue deteriorating, from -0.8 percent
of GDP in 2014 to -12 percent in 2020. The change in the NIIP can mostly be attributed to net foreign direct
investment, which falls by 9½ percentage points of GDP from 2014 to 2020. Net portfolio investment also
deteriorates slightly, by about ½ percentage points of GDP over the same period. Net other investments (e.g.,
loans, deposits, and trade credit), though negative, offset some of this decline. Projected valuation effects
from exchange rate changes also play a role. Gross external debt is expected to remain around 220–230
percent of GDP, while net external debt will average around 50 percent of GDP through 2020.
Staff views the external position as broadly in line with fundamentals. This is supported by the External
Balance Assessment (EBA). The EBA’s CA, REER (Index and Level), and External Sustainability (ES) analyses all
suggest the REER was slightly overvalued in 2014. Given the substantial uncertainty surrounding such
estimates, the staff continues to assess the REER as broadly in line with fundamentals. This is consistent with
the fact that the deterioration in the CA

Policy response:

Full implementation of the macroprudential policy toolkit will help reduce

materialize in the view of the IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks
surrounding this baseline. The RAM reflects staff's views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of

Appendix I. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Public debt rose in 2014, driven by a higher than expected fiscal deficit, and is forecast to exceed
60 percent of GDP in 2015. Under the baseline debt to GDP is expected to peak in 2019 and to
gradually decline thereafter. A contingent liability shock is the stress scenario with the greatest impact
on the public debt-to-GDP ratio. Under the assumptions of this scenario, the debt ratio would rise to
nearly 94 percent of GDP by 2020.

A. Baseline Scenario
1.
Macroeconomic assumptions. Real GDP growth is expected to gradually pick-up, from
0.4 percent in 2015 to 1.6 percent in 2020. While GDP deflator inflation declines to a low of
0.7 percent in 2015, due largely to the effects of energy and food price declines since mid-2014, it is
expected to rebound relatively quickly to 1.4 percent in 2016 and rise to 2.1 percent by 2020.
Interest rates are expected to remain subdued due to QE and the likely gradual pace of rates rises
once monetary policy begins to normalize.
2.
Finland’s debt level is expected to breach 60 percent of GDP in 2015, which calls for
using the higher scrutiny framework. Though this is the first year debt is breaching the 60 percent
of GDP threshold, it is projected to continue rising until 2019 and remain above 60 percent over the
forecast horizon. The Finnish government has announced fiscal consolidation plans to stabilize and
begin reducing the debt. The impact of these efforts on the debt ratio is partially undermined by the
expected negative growth impact of the measures, which is already incorporated in the baseline.
However, given the relatively long average maturity of Finnish public debt, the gross financing needs
remain below 15 percent of GDP every year in the baseline scenario. Moreover, the net debt ratio
remains negative due to the large stock of pension assets, though the net debt deteriorates more
than gross debt rises over time as pension assets are used to pay benefits.
3.
Realism of baseline assumptions. The median forecast error for real GDP growth is
relatively large at -1.27 percent (18th percentile). This is mostly driven by the large negative shock
Finland suffered in 2009 and the initial rapid rebound from the crisis. Median forecast errors for the
primary balance (-0.03 percent of GDP) and inflation (0.2 percent) are modest.
4.
The forecast fiscal adjustment is not large in either absolute terms or by comparison to
other countries’ experiences. The 3-year average change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance
(CAPB) is around 0.5 percent of potential output. This places it firmly in the middle of the
distribution of CAPB adjustments across countries.

B. Stress Testing
5.
Finland’s debt ratio would remain under 100 percent of GDP even in the worst shock
scenario examined. For the standard macro-fiscal stress scenarios, the debt ratio stays below

30

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FINLAND

70 percent of GDP, except in the real GDP shock scenario. The contingent liability shock scenario
causes the largest debt ratio increase, to a peak of around 94 percent of GDP in 2019.
6.

The shock scenarios include:



Real GDP growth shock. Under this scenario, growth is one-standard deviation lower than the
baseline in 2016 and 2017 (i.e., 3.9 percentage points lower). This also causes inflation to be
25 basis points (bps) lower in these years and interest rates to be higher, by 71 bps in 2016 and
by 143 bps in 2017. The debt ratio peaks at 82 percent of GDP in 2019 and the gross financing
need (GFN) exceeds 20 percent of GDP in 2017.



Primary balance shock. In this scenario, the primary balance (PB) is 1.6 percentage points of
GDP lower than in the baseline in 2016 and 2017. The debt ratio almost reaches 70 percent of
GDP in 2019, while the GFN peaks at 15 percent of GDP in 2017.



Real interest rate and real exchange rate shocks. Under the real interest rate shock scenario,
the real interest rate is 274 bps higher than the baseline over 2016-20. Despite this, debt only
reaches 68 percent of GDP by 2020 and the GFN remains below 15 percent of GDP. The impact
of the real exchange rate shock is even smaller, with the debt ratio only 1 percent of GDP higher
than in the baseline at its peak in 2019 and the GFN remains almost identical to the GFN in the
baseline scenario.



Combined macro-fiscal shock. This scenario is a combination of the effects of the macro-fiscal
scenarios above. In this scenario, growth and inflation fall, the primary balance deteriorates, the
exchange rate depreciates, and interest rates rise relative to the baseline. The debt ratio rises
above 85 percent of GDP by 2020, while the GFN hits an apex of 21 percent of GDP in 2017.



Contingent liability shock. In this scenario, the contingent liability shock in 2016 equals about
17 percent of GDP. Additionally, growth falls as in the real GDP shock scenario and the real
interest rate spikes 441 bps in 2016. As a result, the debt ratio jumps more than 20 percentage
points of GDP between 2015 and 2016 and the GFN peaks at around 30 percent of GDP in 2016.
The debt ratio peaks near 94 percent of GDP in 2019.

PAST FUND STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS AND
IMPLEMENTATION
Past Staff Recommendations

Implementation
Fiscal Policy

Gradual fiscal adjustment in line with the
strength of the economy, focused on mediumterm reforms to close the sustainability gap.

Since 2011 the government has implemented
fiscal consolidation measures worth about 3
percent of GDP in nominal terms. Pension
reforms should reduce the fiscal sustainability
gap by 1 percentage point of GDP.

Make the composition of adjustment as growth
friendly as possible.

The standard VAT rate, energy and excise taxes
were raised to allow for a broadly revenue
neutral corporate income tax rate cut in 2014.

Allow automatic stabilizers to operate if growth
is weaker than expected.

Unemployment benefit spending was allowed to
rise in 2014 as growth disappointed.

Labor Market Policy
Pension reforms to lift the effective retirement
age would support labor force growth.

Pension reforms currently being legislated will
raise the average effective retirement age to 62.4
years old by 2025.

Reforms of tertiary education and student aid
could promote longer working lives.

Measures to reform tertiary education financing,
including reducing the duration of student aid
are being implemented.

Increasing the quantity of affordable housing in
Helsinki would facilitate labor mobility.

An agreement was reached between the central
government and municipalities in the Helsinki
area to increase land available for development.

Competition Policy
Measures to increase competition in services and
product markets can boost productivity growth.

Proposals to liberalize shop opening hours
should increase retail sector competition.

Financial Sector Policy
Implement the European macroprudential policy
framework (CRD-IV/CRR), including a systemic
risk buffer and binding loan-to-value (LTV) ratio.

The 2014 Act on Credit Institutions introduced
the required CRD IV/CRR instruments, as well as
a maximum LTV ratio.

Designate the independent Board of the FIN-FSA
as the macroprudential policy authority.

The Act established the FIN-FSA as the
designated macroprudential authority and the
FIN-FSA board as the decision making body for
macroprudential decisions.

Statement by Mr. Audun Groenn, Executive Director for Finland and
Mr. Paavo Miettinen, Advisor to the Executive Director
November 11, 2015
Our Finnish authorities would like to thank staff for comprehensive and candid discussions
during the consultations and for an in-depth analysis of the state of economy, reform
programs and the policy framework. The authorities’ views have been accurately
documented, and the authorities would like to only make comments on economic
developments and the new government’s program for reviving growth and consolidating
public finances. The Finnish authorities broadly concur with staff’s appraisal and the overall
policy recommendations and analysis. The appraisal lends support to the government’s goal
to reverse the deterioration in competitiveness and to strengthen the Finnish economy.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
Finland is undergoing an extended period of slow economic growth that is among the
weakest on record. GDP in 2015 is projected to be more than five percentage points below
the 2008 level, and unemployment figures have risen close to double digits. It is of particular
concern that lately the long term and structural unemployment rates have increased rapidly.
Finland has experienced several asymmetric shocks that include the decline in two important
export industries, deterioration in productivity, rapid rise in unit labor costs, weakness in the
main trading partners’ economies and a quickly aging population. These developments are
well described in the staff report and the selected issues papers.
The economic projections for Finland envisage only a slow recovery and a continuation of
low growth. The risks for the near term are also on the downside. The Ministry of Finance
projects close to zero growth for this year and a tepid strengthening of the recovery to an
annual 1.3 percent GDP growth in 2016. While domestic consumption will remain weak due
to a moderate pick-up in inflation and the fiscal consolidation measures, investment activity
should be accelerating due to some large investments that are already under way or in the
pipeline in the forestry industry, as well as and in chemical and construction industries.
Moreover, the external environment will support growth as many of Finland’s main trading
partners are growing reasonably well supported by accommodative monetary policies and
low oil prices. The contribution of net exports to growth in Finland will remain weak in
2016, as imports pick up due to investment growth. Also weakness in many emerging
markets and continued volatility in financial markets pose risks to the external environment.
Recently the wave of refugees to Europe is having its impact on public finances in Finland as
well.
Fiscal policy: a balancing act geared to consolidation of public finances and reviving
growth
Finland, being a small open economy, is very dependent on exports of both goods and
increasingly also of services, and hence the key priority is to maintain competitiveness in
global markets. This is also a prerequisite for the sustainability of the Nordic welfare model.
The new government is committed to an ambitious reform agenda aimed at raising the
employment rate, promoting entrepreneurship, and the long term growth potential. That said,

the authorities are fully aware of the urgent need to implement structural reforms in order to
revive economic growth and consolidate public finances to a sustainable level. However,
most structural reforms will start to have impact only in the medium term, but their
implementation is long overdue.
The government is committed to making decisions to cover the entire sustainability gap of 10
billion Euros. The consolidation of public finances will firstly halt by the end of the
Government term and then reverse the increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio in 2021. In the short
run, the authorities are pursuing a balancing act with necessary consolidation efforts while
trying to induce economic recovery. The authorities are determined to preserve the
confidence in fiscal stability in Finland and to comply with fiscal rules of the EU. The
consolidation measures include mainly expenditure reductions, but will also raise revenue by
excise tax increases, and an accelerated removal of mortgage interest rate deductions. At the
same time, the income taxes for the low and middle income earners are somewhat reduced in
order to promote work incentives. As noted in the staff report, the magnitude of the negative
effects from consolidation measures depend on the size of the fiscal multipliers that are
highly uncertain. The impact of asylum seekers and refugees is taken into account and the
government has already proposed an addendum to the budget to account for the fiscal costs
related to the rapid inflow of asylum seekers.
The government’s reform program is supported with a one-off investment package worth 1.6
billion euros that will also off-set some of the negative effects from the consolidation
measures. About a third of the package is directed to reducing the infrastructure repair debt
and the remainder is devoted to the advancement of the Government’s key projects and
reforms.
Structural reforms to be implemented without delay
Closing the competitiveness gap. For a small open economy like Finland, the more rapid
increase in unit labor costs in comparison to peers and the persistent current account deficits
in the past few years that is forecast to last until 2020 illustrate a deeper structural problem of
the economy. Due to the loss of the ICT-intensive export base there was a shift from high
labor productivity output to lower labor productivity production that resulted in a loss of
competitiveness in the exports sector.
The government’s goal is to reverse the deterioration in the Finnish competitiveness. While
the negotiations for a social contract with labor unions and employers’ federations broke
down, the government is proceeding with legislative measures to reduce unit labor costs. To
regain competitiveness, these measures need to be complemented with a sustained period of
very moderate pay increases, and companies and communities need to make individual
efforts to improve their efficiency.
The government has prepared a set of measures to reduce the unit labor costs by 5 percentage
points while also strengthening the employees’ redundancy security. The proposed measures
include a removal of two public holidays, reductions in paid sick-leave and in holiday
allowance, and a cut in the public sector annual leave to 6 weeks. The employees’
redundancy security is improved by forcing medium and large companies to provide health

benefits for six months, and an option to receive re-employment coaching that is worth the
company’s average one-month pay in a layoff situation. These measures would enter into
force as mandatory ceilings by the time of the next collective wage bargaining agreement in
2016, if enacted, and they would remain in force for three years. In the meantime, the labor
unions and the employer federations continue discussions to find alternative ways to achieve
the targeted reduction in unit labor costs.
Labor market reforms. The Ministry of Employment and the Economy is considering
proposals that would pave the way for wider use of localized wage agreements and a more
flexible use of working-time. The proposals also underline that the employees should have
representation in the firm’s decision-making bodies to improve information sharing,
transparency and to build trust for the local level wage bargaining. The proposal received
mixed reviews by the labor market representatives, but the Ministry will continue to finalize
the proposal, which is part of the government’s program to reform the wage bargaining
process.
The government has also proposed to reduce the earnings-related unemployment benefits to
400 days from the current 500 days starting from 2017, as part of the fiscal consolidation
package and to increase labor supply. On ALMP, the government´s program introduces a
project to increase the efficiency of the public employment services (PES). The priorities of
the reform are to make full use of digitalization in the PES, to create closer contacts with the
employers and to respond to their recruitment needs and to enhance the role of the private
employment services. In order to decrease income trap due to a high participation tax rate,
from 2014 on, an income of 300 Euros per month is allowed without reduction of
unemployment benefits or housing subsidy.
The government program also supports the increase of housing supply in the Helsinki
metropolitan area that would promote labor mobility.
Education reform to increase working life/labor force participation. The government has
introduced cuts in education and R & D. The latter is not supported by staff, but the
authorities see room for a more efficient use of the remaining funding. According to the
authorities, the reform program envisages a better cooperation between institutions of tertiary
education and business life as well as accelerating graduation and transition to working life,
and this would result in savings.
Innovation and deregulation. The reform program gives also special emphasis to
development of bio-economy and clean technologies for achieving climate goals and
improving export performance. In addition, the program envisages increased use of
digitalization and dismantling of unnecessary regulation and zoning restrictions. The changes
also aim to promote complementary construction and to significantly increase the supply of
both housing and building sites. A proposal to liberalize shop opening hours has already been
tabled in the parliament.
Finalizing key reforms in health care and municipalities
The government has indicated that it will reduce municipalities’ responsibilities that would

achieve about one billion euros in savings by 2019. The Government’s fiscal plan for 20162019 contains a maximum limit of expenditures for the local governments and it includes a
number of measures aimed at strengthening local government finances.
The government’s social welfare and health care reform work is underway. A draft
Government proposal will be circulated for comment in April 2016. The Government
proposal will be submitted to parliament in October 2016.
The objective of the reform of social welfare and health care services is to narrow health
disparities and manage costs (so called SOTE reform). The current system is fragmented,
disintegrated and inefficient. Hence, the reform will be implemented with a complete
horizontal and vertical integration of services, and by strengthening the capacity of service
providers. The integration is expected to have a significant impact on the sustainability in
public finances. With SOTE reform, the Government seeks to reduce the cost of social
welfare and health care services by 3 billion euros by 2029 (at 2019 prices). The estimated
impact to sustainability gap would be -1.25 percent of GDP.
The new structure for social welfare and health care services will be based on autonomous
regions. The service provision is consolidated from municipalities to these larger regions that
may also use the private sector in service production. In order to control for the expenditure
on social and health care services and enhance efficiency, the possibility of opening up the
market (for more) private competition will be explored. Additionally, the details regarding a
freedom of choice model will be explored, as well as the legislative amendments required by
EU directive on Patient Mobility.
Financial sector stability
The Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV) was adopted in the Finnish legislation in
2014. The FIN-FSA was appointed as the designated macro prudential authority and the
FINFSA Board was given the responsibility for macroprudential policy decisions. The
Finnish authorities support the establishment of a systemic risk buffer, but the legislation
process would most likely be postponed until next year due to the existing legislation
backlog. The authorities see a deepened regional cooperation on financial sector issues of
utmost importance between the Nordic and Baltic countries. Finally, the authorities
appreciate the plan to conduct FSAPs for Finland and Sweden back-to-back in 2016, as these
assessments will provide a thorough review of the Finnish financial sector performance and a
framework to identify systemic vulnerabilities. The combination of these exercises offers
also an assessment of the Nordic financial and insurance institutions and their operating
environment.
