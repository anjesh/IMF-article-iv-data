STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION DISCUSSIONS

KEY ISSUES
Setting: Montserrat has made enormous progress in its recovery from the 1995
eruption of a long dormant volcano, with substantial support from the UK and the EU.
However, the volcano, which remains intermittently active, has had a large and lasting
demographic, economic, and social impact, and in some respects the recovery is still
under way. Donor support also buffered the impact of the global crisis in 2009–10. The
2011 Article IV Consultation Discussions represent the Fund’s first formal bilateral
dialogue with this British overseas territory, building on the annual Eastern Caribbean
Currency Union Common Policies discussions.
Addressing financial vulnerabilities: The recession and the failure of two regional
insurance companies (CLICO/BAICO) have weakened several financial institutions, and
the authorities are developing a strategy to address vulnerabilities. It will be important
to clean up the balance sheets of the financial institutions with impaired assets and to
obtain new capital where necessary. An action plan is needed that spells out the
respective roles of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, the Montserratian government,
and the Financial Services Commission (FSC) of Montserrat. Efforts to strengthen
nonbank supervision should continue.
Increasing fiscal independence: The guiding principles for fiscal policy have been to
target an overall balance while reducing dependence on UK grants over time. The
medium-term fiscal framework needs to be revisited to close financing gaps from 2012
onwards, as the roadmap for reducing dependence was built on assumptions for
growth and revenue that have not been borne out. Efforts to simplify the tax system
and to improve tax administration should continue. The immediate policy challenge is
to agree with the UK on a revised quantitative framework and reform timetable.
Enhancing growth prospects: There are several promising opportunities to enhance
long-term growth prospects and viability. The construction of a new capital and port is
the keystone of the public investment program, and overcoming implementation
delays should be a key short-run policy priority. There is substantial scope to enhance
the tourism product and access to the island. A new framework is being put in place for
the mining of volcanic sands, the only goods export. Looking ahead, lowering energy
costs including through geothermal sources could improve economic prospects.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

SETTING
1.
Montserrat, a small island with
limited natural resources, was devastated
by the eruption beginning in 1995 of a long
dormant volcano, which has continued to
cycle through periods of activity and
inactivity. The eruption took place at a time
when a vibrant economy had reemerged after
Hurricane Hugo destroyed 95 percent of the
island’s structures in 1989. The volcano left
more than half of the island uninhabitable,
including the former capital, airport, port, and
the best agricultural land. Although the
volcano has been inactive since early 2010,
certain areas are subject to evacuation during
periods of high volcanic activity.
2.
The island has made enormous
progress in its recovery, with substantial
support from the UK government, the
European Union, and other donors.
Nevertheless, the eruption has had a large and
lasting demographic, economic and social
impact. In a number of key respects the
economy has not fully adapted to living with a
volcano (Box 1). Much of the government
remains in temporary quarters, and the
construction of a new capital city and of a
permanent port is at an early stage. The
government dominates the economy and
accounts for over half of employment.
3.
The volcano led about three
quarters of the population to emigrate,
redefining the island’s demographics. There
remain skill shortages from significant brain
drain, an aging population, and inadequate
housing. Unemployment is estimated at
14 percent. The population shrank from about
14,000 persons to a low of around 3,500, and

has since recovered to about 5,000. A
significant portion of emigration was to the UK
where Montserratians are automatically
citizens, and also to North America and other
Caribbean countries.
4.
The economy has been losing
ground, with tourism in a continued
decline. First, residential tourism by part-year
residents and retired expatriates has had to
confront volcano-related hassles, including ash
clouds and evacuations of certain areas during
periods of high volcanic activity. Second,
access to the island has become more difficult.
The discontinuation of fast ferry service in
2005 led to a large drop in day visitors from
Antigua, and the current limited ferry service
has faced operational difficulties over the past
year. Two air carriers provide service with small
airplanes (less than ten seats) after a regional
carrier flying larger planes (with 19 seats)
rationalized its routes in December 2010.
Cruise ship visits are sporadic.
5.
The island’s only goods export is
volcanic sand used for construction, and
import dependence is very high. The small
capacity of the port and unpredictable weather
conditions further increase the cost of
importing and exporting. There has been
progress toward self sufficiency in some
agricultural products, complicated by
concentration in land ownership. The island is
a net sender of remittances, despite the high
level of emigration, reflecting remittances by
relatively more recent immigrants. Foreign
investment, largely in residential real estate, is
limited.

6.
Montserrat’s budget is sustained by
grants from the UK, which finance around
half of expenditure. The ability to mobilize
revenue domestically is constrained by the
dominant role of the government and donor
activity which is not taxable.

7.
Resources mobilized by the two
commercial banks are primarily directed
abroad due to limited domestic lending
opportunities. Most domestic lending is for
real estate and personal loans. The banking
system does not finance the government.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
8.
UK grants buffered the impact of
the global crisis on Montserrat. Although the
economy grew in 2009, it contracted in 2010
due in part to a small volcanic eruption and
the passage of Hurricane Earl in 2010. These
events contributed to a decline in the number
of stayover visitors and weak import demand.
However, growth in credit to the (very small)
private sector was sustained at previous levels.
Inflation remained low at around 2.5 percent in
2009–10.
9.
Although grants sustained
expenditure in 2009, the fiscal stance in
2010 was contractionary. In that year, grants
and to a lesser extent revenue fell off,
notwithstanding a tax amnesty which yielded
0.6 percent of GDP, and current expenditure
was curtailed. The fiscal stance and weak
activity reflect in part implementation delays in
key capital projects.

10.
Public sector debt is low at 5 percent
of GDP. The debt consists primarily of
borrowing from the Caribbean Development
Bank for the construction of the former port.
However, the large exposures of the public
sector and financial system to CLICO/BAICO
(49 percent of GDP) are to some extent explicit
or implicit contingent liabilities of the
government.
11.
Loan quality deteriorated since the
onset of the global crisis, but not to the
same extent as the rest of the ECCU. Loan
write-offs have reduced profitability and
capital ratios, but capital adequacy is well
above required levels.
12.
The economic outlook hinges upon
progress with major public capital projects,
improving access to the island, and
strengthening the private sector. Staff
projections assume that capital projects
contribute to an initial burst of growth in near
term, and that growth converges in the
medium-term to 3 percent.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

POLICY ISSUES
The key policy challenges are addressing financial sector vulnerabilities, increasing fiscal
independence, and enhancing growth prospects.

A. Addressing Financial Vulnerabilities
13.
Due in part to limited domestic
investment opportunities, Montserrat’s
financial and public sector institutions
became heavily exposed to CLICO/BAICO.
The overall exposure is EC$ 76 million (nearly
half of GDP). The only indigenous commercial
bank, although exposed to CLICO/BAICO, has
been provisioning for its exposures, and plans
to be fully provisioned by 2012. The bank is
solvent, based on available information, but
has recognized the need to strengthen its
capital base.

Estimated Exposure to CLICO and BAICO 1/
(In millions of EC$)



The only credit union has been running
a loss. In addition to its exposure to
CLICO/BAICO, its NPLs have been
increasing, and it has not published
audited accounts since 2007.

The Government Savings Bank (GSB)
also has significant exposure to

Nonbank financial institutions also
have significant exposures. These institutions
are supervised by a single regulatory unit, the
Financial Services Commission (FSC), with the
exception of the Building Society which is
conservatively managed and does not pose
risks to the financial sector.1 Nevertheless, it
should be brought under the authority of the
FSC.

15.
The offshore banking sector has
been shrinking in assets and deposits. There
are six offshore banks, all subsidiaries of banks
outside the Caribbean subject to home
country supervision, and none with a physical
presence in Montserrat. The indigenous bank
also has an offshore license as it takes deposits
from individuals who are not full year
residents. The offshore banking sector does
not appear to be a source of vulnerability to
Montserrat’s financial system.
16.
The authorities should continue to
strengthen the regulation and supervision
of the financial sector. A joint regional task
force is being formed to determine the size of
the liquidity and capital shortfalls in
indigenous institutions, assess direct and
indirect linkages, and develop resolution
strategies. It will be important to move
urgently and preemptively to shore up the
balance sheets of those institutions with
impaired assets and to obtain new capital
where necessary. An action plan is needed that
spells out the respective roles of the
Montserratian government, the Eastern
Caribbean Central Bank, and the FSC.
17.
The authorities welcomed the staff’s
assessment and recognized the need to
shore up weak financial institutions,
pointing to several initiatives in this regard.
In particular, the government is working
closely with the indigenous bank to strengthen
its capital base, including by converting its
claims on the bank to equity. At the same time,
they recognize the need for a regional
approach.2 The government has retained a
consultant to assess options for strengthening

the credit union, relying on new legislation
which has strengthened the FSC’s powers. The
government is defining options to shore up
the GSB’s finances and to restructure its
operations.

B. Increasing Fiscal Independence
18.
The guiding principles for fiscal
policy have been to target an overall
balance, while reducing dependence on
UK grants over time. In 2011, UK current
grants are expected to fall below the unusually
high levels in 2009-10 and the reduction in
current grants is expected to continue in 2013
and beyond. As a result, although revenue is
expected to improve, expenditure will fall by
3 percentage points of GDP.
19.
The immediate fiscal policy
challenge is to agree on a revised
quantitative framework and timetable for
reforms in discussion with the UK. The
roadmap agreed in 2009 with the UK to reduce
dependence on current grants, from
EC$ 57 million in 2009 to EC$ 44 million in
2014, was built upon assumptions for
economic growth and revenue which have not
been borne out.3 This in part reflects delays in
the implementation of capital projects,
including the construction of a new capital and
port that would have stimulated economic
activity. Given that the scope in the near term
to increase revenue appears limited given the
small size of the private sector, a new medium
term framework could define new trajectories
for current grants and expenditure. Transfers

The fiscal projections in Tables 2a-b incorporate the
roadmap’s trajectory for grants with staff projections
for revenue and expenditure.

UNITED KINGDOM–MONTSERRAT–BRITISH OVERSEAS TERRITORY

should be targeted toward vulnerable groups,
while allowing full passthrough of changes in
international prices, in accordance with a 2008
ECCB Monetary Council decision.4 In addition,
the fiscal framework should also address
contingent liabilities stemming from the
territory’s large BAICO/CLICO exposure.
20.
The medium-term trajectory for
capital expenditure will be determined
primarily by the pace of implementation of
the major donor-financed projects. The
authorities should assess with particular care
any future projects with a loan financing
component to ensure that they will generate a
revenue stream sufficient to repay the loan.
21.
Significant efforts have been made
to improve tax administration. The merger
of Inland Revenue and Customs has led to
efficiency gains, and the merged services have
increased the yield of taxes on international
trade, launched an income tax amnesty
program which has yielded EC$ 1 million, and
increased compliance with tax legislation. The
planned creation of a single Taxpayer
Identification Number and the addition of an
income tax module to the existing ASYCUDA
World system for customs would provide a
single technology platform for tax
administration.
22.
The staff also supports plans to
simplify the tax system. The authorities
intend to replace the Service Tax and the
multi-rate Consumption Tax with a General
Consumption Tax in a revenue neutral manner.
4

The UK’s subsequent mid-term budget review
recognized that current revenue and expenditure
targets are no longer achievable and it was agreed to
develop a new roadmap and reform timetable later
this year.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

The tax is envisioned to have a single rate of
15 percent with limited exemptions for food
and other necessities. In addition, the
authorities will introduce excise taxes on
goods with inelastic demand to be identified.
Taxation of income will become more
progressive, with the introduction of a higher
40 percent tax rate for individuals with high
income while reducing the tax burden for tax
payers below a threshold. The staff encourages
the authorities to take the opportunity to
rationalize the system of fees and non-tax
revenues and to remove nuisance taxes. When
the new framework for the export of volcanic
sands is in place, the government should
consider raising the royalty on sand mining. A
levy on over-flights of the volcano originating
in Antigua could also be explored.
23.
The government has adopted
measures to improve the sustainability of
the Social Security Fund. According to a 2005
actuarial review, the Fund will extend the
expected date of asset depletion beyond 2034.
The Legislative Council adopted a Pension
Amendment which will gradually increase the
retirement age of civil servants from 55 to 65,
adjust the pension accrual rate from two to
one percent, and cap the combination of
Social Security payments and Civil Service
Pension at 85 percent of salary. The next
actuarial review should assess to what extent
the passage of the Pension Amendment has
stabilized the Social Security Fund finances and
indicate if any additional measures are needed.
The review will also need to account for the
Fund’s CLICO/BAICO exposure, which was over
one third of the Fund’s investment portfolio at
end-2009. In addition, the government should
settle its obligations to the Social Security
Fund of EC$ 21 million per an agreement in
June 2009.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

24.
The authorities recognized the
needs to revise the medium-term
framework. They observed that the scope for
cutting current expenditure was limited
without scaling back government services or
labor shedding that would lead to additional

emigration to the UK, undercutting population
objectives. They recognized the desirability of
rationalizing the system of fees and non-tax
revenue, and will explore the scope for higher
royalties from sand mining once the new
framework is in place.

C. Enhancing Growth Prospects
25.
Montserrat has a number of
promising opportunities to enhance its
growth prospects and the viability of its
economy. These include constructing a new
capital and port, enhancing the tourism
product and access to the island, putting in
place a sound framework for the export of
volcanic sand, lowering energy costs, and
harnessing the resources of the diaspora.
26.
The keystone of this investment
program, the construction of a new capital
and port in Little Bay, has faced delays in
implementation. A larger port would allow
simultaneous docking of a cruise ship and the
ferry to Antigua. A new capital would provide a
focal point for public and private sector
activity, which could encompass government
buildings, offices and retail outlets, and a
foreign financed hotel. The project is likely to
be completed in 2013. The short-run priority
should be to accelerate the investment
program by overcoming implementation
constraints and obtaining grant financing.
27.
Improving access to the island and
enhancing the tourism product are also
priorities. The government and its
development partners are exploring options to
restore fast ferry service and to reestablish
service by a regional airline. In addition, an
investment program is underway to enrich the
tourist experience by taking advantage of
Montserrat’s unique characteristics. There is

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

scope to gain more benefit from volcanobased tourism.
28.
The current problematic approach
for the mining of volcanic sands, the only
goods export, is being replaced with a
sound and sustainable strategy. The mining
of sand, which flowed during the eruption
through a quiet center of residential tourism,
and trucking it across the island has entailed
numerous negative externalities while placing
the industry at a cost disadvantage. The new
strategy would put in place a new dedicated
jetty near the mining operations with legal and
regulatory safeguards aimed at minimizing
negative environmental impacts while
increasing industry and government revenue.
Establishing a national consensus behind the
new strategy will be crucial for it to succeed in
resolving a highly controversial issue.
29.
Lowering energy costs including
through geothermal energy would improve
economic prospects. In the near term, a new
diesel generation facility to be financed by the
Caribbean Development Bank will improve
efficiency and help reduce the state electricity
company’s operating losses, which may also
require tariff revisions. Prospects for
geothermal energy production are good, and
the authorities are seeking financing to drill an
exploratory production well, which if successful
could become operational in two years.
Subsequently, exporting electricity to

UNITED KINGDOM–MONTSERRAT–BRITISH OVERSEAS TERRITORY

neighboring islands is a realistic possibility,
and there have been early consultations with
potential foreign investors. The island, which
was dropped from the Caribbean fiber optic
link after the eruption, is also seeking to
improve communications linkages.
30.
Improving the business environment
will be essential to rebuilding a viable
private sector. The business community noted
some strengths, such as the ability to clear
items through customs within the day taking
advantage of the full computerization of
customs using ASYCUDA World. However,
some other administrative and legal
procedures are cumbersome. Staff
recommended establishing a one-stop shop
for investors, making a more formal assessing
of the business environment to provide a
diagnostic and benchmark for progress.
Although two of three quantitative methods
used to assess the level of the exchange rate
suggest large overvaluations of 39–56 percent
(Box 2), these may reflect Montserrat's
grant-driven balance of payments and
significant data limitations, and private sector
representatives did not raise the issue.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

31.
The authorities have recognized the
need to increase the population in order to
achieve a viable scale for the economy. The
population has been growing gradually in
recent years, driven more by immigration from
the Caribbean region rather than from
returning residents. Nevertheless, there would
be significant gains from better harnessing the
resources of the diaspora. The staff noted the
potential for an investors’ conference to shift
perceptions by highlighting the numerous
initiatives that are approaching fruition, and
the authorities plan several events aimed at
foreign investors and former residents.
32.
The authorities with concurred with
the staff on the range of opportunities
available to enhance growth. They
recognized the need to accelerate the
investment program. They are hopeful the new
framework for sand mining, which was
developed after extensive consultation, will
address widespread concerns in a mutually
beneficial manner. They are exploring
measures to monitor and enhance the
business environment, and have already held
several events directed at investors and former
residents.

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
Montserrat has made considerable
progress in recovering from the eruption of
the volcano, which remains intermittently
active. However, in many respects, the island’s
economy is still out of equilibrium, as it adapts
to living with the volcano while exploiting
related opportunities. The economy is
sustained by grants from the UK and is
expected to gradually recover and reduce its
dependence.
34.
The authorities need to undertake a
range of actions to take advantage of

opportunities to promote long run growth.
Access to the island is an important bottleneck
that impedes economic growth generally and
the growth of tourism specifically. Restoration
of fast ferry service and expansion of the port
would address this concern. Construction of a
new capital would provide a focal point for
private and public activity, and the short-run
priority should be to accelerate the investment
program by overcoming implementation
constraints and obtaining grant financing. The
authorities are putting in place a sound

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

UNITED KINGDOM–MONTSERRAT–BRITISH OVERSEAS TERRITORY

framework for the mining of volcanic sands,
which is a promising export industry, but has
also imposed several negative externalities on
the island. Notwithstanding indicators of
possible overvaluation, the private sector did
not identify the level of the exchange rate as
an issue.
35.
Ensuring a reliable energy supply
and minimizing its cost is essential for
faster growth. The authorities should
continue with the development of the diesel
generating capacity and also fully explore the
possibility to develop geothermal energy
sources. Lower energy costs could transform
the island’s economy.
36.
Reducing dependence on recurrent
and capital grants is a key objective of fiscal
policy. After the volcanic eruption, fiscal
operations have centered on maintaining an
overall balance. The immediate challenge is to
reach agreement with the UK on a revised

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

fiscal framework and timetable for reforms in
light of implementation delays in key projects
and the current economic environment.
37.
The authorities have made
commendable progress in improving the
tax administration. They should maintain this
momentum through further progress with its
reform strategy including introducing a single
Taxpayer Identification Number and
integrating IT systems.
38.
The government has already
developed a strategy for addressing
financial vulnerabilities and made initial
progress. Urgent and preemptive action is
essential, as is an action plan spelling out the
roles of the key players. Regulation and
supervision of the nonbank financial sector
needs to be further improved, and the building
society should be brought under the purview
the FSC.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 1. Living with the Volcano
After a long period of dormancy, the
volcano’s eruption in 1995 redefined the
island geographically, economically and
demographically. The eruption affected
most of the southern part of the island,
destroying the economic center of the island,
including the capital city, the port, the airport,
and the best agricultural land. The volcano
has subsequently gone through five cycles of
activity and inactivity, and it is unpredictable
if and when the current period of inactivity
will end. Certain zones must be evacuated
during periods of high activity, which along
with other hassles has led some expatriates to
leave over time.

Efforts to exploit the economic benefits of
the volcano are at an early stage.


The mining of volcanic sand has
entailed many negative externalities.
The sand is mined in a valley where many
expatriates have homes. Furthermore, it is
trucked to the other end of the island
along the main highway to the port at
Little Bay, which has damaged the road
and increased costs. A new framework is
being implemented to address these
issues.



The potential for volcano-based
tourism is also not fully developed.
Tourists can see the volcano and its
impact on the former capital city,
described as a modern Pompei, by air and
by sea, and a museum is being
developed. However, the only air tours
are based in Antigua, with no benefit to
Montserrat.



There is a high probability of an
exploitable geothermal system which
could be used to produce energy. The
next step is to find financing to drill a
production well to prove the existence of
a viable resource before approaching
private investors. The well would be in the
exclusion zone, while the generation
facility would not.

Despite progress toward recovery, in many
respects the economy is still adjusting to a
new equilibrium:




The post-eruption economy has been
sustained by grants, although the
eventual goal is to reduce dependence.
The public sector employs the majority of
the labor force, and tourism, which is
largely residential, has been declining,
with the number of total visitors falling
from 40,000 annually prior to the volcanic
eruption to about 9,400 in 2010. The
island’s only goods export is volcanic
sand used for construction, while the
island imports 95 percent of its
consumption.
The construction of a new port and
capital in Little Bay is at an early stage,
and much of the government is still in
temporary quarters. The redevelopment
of the existing port is expected to take
several years to complete.

on a declining trend in the last two years. The
customer-based real effective exchange rate has
been on a declining trend since 2009, when it
appreciated due to increases in global food and fuel
prices. It then moved in line with US dollar
depreciation against major customer currencies. The
competitor-based real effective exchange rate has
stayed broadly constant since 2005.

The external sustainability approach2 suggests an
overvaluation of 56 percent. This approach
indicates that the NFA-stabilizing CA is minus
14.6 percent of GDP while the underlying CA is
minus 23.7 percent of GDP, implying a large
depreciation would be needed to stabilize net
foreign assets.

2003–2011 (July)

The assessment of the exchange rate using CGER
methodologies is constrained by significant data
limitations.

120

The fundamentals-based equilibrium real
exchange rate (ERER) approach, which looks at
fundamentals that are believed to determine the
equilibrium REER, indicates that the actual real
effective exchange rate has been close to its
long-run equilibrium.1 During 2004–10, the REER
has indeed remained within a 90 percent confidence
interval around the equilibrium.
The macroeconomic balance approach, points to
an overvaluation of 39 percent. The CGER
methodology based on a world sample of
111 countries suggests that the current account (CA)
norm is minus 17.3 percent of GDP against the
underlying CA of minus 23.7 percent of GDP.
Closing the gap between the norm and the current
account in the medium term would therefore require
the specified large depreciation. The implied
overvaluation reflects the island’s high dependence
on imports, imports being greater than exports,
inducing a very low CA balance to GDP elasticity.

2/ The sharp movements in the competitor-based real exchange rate in
2002–04 were largely driven by the Dominican Republic’s peso.

The estimation of the equilibrium exchange rate takes
into account productivity differential in the tourism sector
(using per capital tourist arrivals instead of per capital
GDP), terms of trade for tourism, government
consumption, and net foreign assets. For more details see:

estimation for the ECCU region, as they represent an
important source of financing.

International Monetary Fund

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation Discussions
with United Kingdom–Montserrat–British Overseas Territory

On November 28, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the first ever Article IV consultation discussions with United Kingdom–
Montserrat–British Overseas Territory.1
Background
Montserrat has made enormous progress in its recovery from the 1995 eruption of a long
dormant volcano, which remains intermittently active. The economy is sustained by grants
from the UK. Low growth is expected in 2011 after sharp output contractions in 2009–10.
Stress in the financial sector and slower than expected development of the major capital
investment projects continue to limit prospects for growth.
The island has made enormous progress in its recovery, with generous support from the
UK government, the European Union, and other donors. Nevertheless, the eruption has
had a large and lasting demographic, economic and social impact.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country or territory, collects economic and
financial information, and discusses with officials the economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

UNITED KINGDOM–MONTSERRAT–BRITISH OVERSEAS TERRITORY

Grants from the UK finance around half of expenditure. The ability to mobilize revenue
domestically is constrained by the dominant role of government and donor activity which is
not taxable. UK grants buffered the impact of the global crisis on Montserrat. The economy
contracted in 2009–10 due in part to a small volcanic eruption and the passage of
Hurricane Earl in 2010. Inflation remained low at around 2.5 percent in 2009–10. Although
UK grants sustained expenditure in 2009, the fiscal stance in 2010 was contractionary. The
fiscal stance and weak activity reflect in part implementation delays in key capital projects.
The economic outlook hinges upon progress with major public capital projects, improving
access to the island, and strengthening the private sector.
Executive Board Assessment
The Executive Directors welcomed Montserrat’s significant progress in recovering from the
eruption of the volcano, which remains intermittently active. At the same time, they noted
that in many respects the island’s economy is still out of equilibrium, as it adapts to living
with the volcano while exploiting related opportunities. They supported the authorities in
their efforts with support from the United Kingdom to gradually reduce dependence on
external grants.
Directors welcomed the development of a strategy for addressing financial vulnerabilities
and the initial progress in implementing it. They supported preemptive action to minimize
costs and risks and preparation of an action plan spelling out the roles of the key players.
They urged the authorities to further improve regulation and supervision of the nonbank
financial sector and bringing the building society under the purview of the Financial
Services Commission.
Directors agreed that reducing dependence on recurrent and capital grants should be a key
objective of fiscal policy. They urged the authorities to reach agreement with the United
Kingdom on a revised fiscal framework and timetable for reforms in light of implementation
delays in key projects and the current economic environment. Directors commended the
authorities’ progress in improving tax administration and urged them to maintain
momentum with reforms including by introducing a single Taxpayer Identification Number
and integrating IT systems.
Directors encouraged the authorities to take advantage of a range of opportunities to
promote long-run growth. They noted that improving access to the island would remove an
important bottleneck that impedes economic growth generally and tourism in particular. In
addition, construction of a new capital would provide a focal point for private and public
activity. They suggested that the short-run priority should be to accelerate the investment
program by overcoming implementation constraints and obtaining grant financing. Directors
welcomed steps toward putting in place a sound framework for the mining of volcanic
sands which would facilitate exports while addressing negative externalities.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Directors underscored that ensuring a reliable energy supply and minimizing its cost would
be essential for faster growth. They encouraged the authorities to continue improving
energy generating capacity and fully exploring the possibility to develop geothermal energy
sources.
Directors welcomed the Montserratian authorities’ decision to propose the first ever Article
IV Consultation Discussions, which had helped provide context for the 2011 Eastern
Caribbean Currency Union Common Policies Discussions, and hoped that the close dialog
developed would continue.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

ANNEX II. MONTSERRAT’S RELATIONS WITH THE
CARIBBEAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (CDB)
(As of July 31, 2011)
The CDB’s interventions in Montserrat in the
aftermath of the volcanic eruptions which
began in 1995 have been primarily limited to
the provision of technical assistance (TA) for
capacity building and small-scale infrastructure
projects financed under the Basic Needs Trust
Fund (BNTF) programme. However, even
these capacity building efforts are challenged
by human resource deficiencies which are
evident as the country seeks to restore viability
through the rebuilding of social and economic
infrastructure.
Under the BNTF programme, TA is being
provided in a number of critical areas relevant
to community upliftment and empowerment,
leading to the enhancement of social and
human capital. Table 1 shows the grant
amounts approved and disbursed within the
various categories during the 2006–10 period.
Between October 2006 and December 2009, a
number of public servants in Montserrat
benefited from a CDB sponsored Project Cycle
Management Training Programme designed to
improve project administration capacity within
the Bank’s borrowing member countries. In
addition to attending a number of training
modules in Trinidad and Tobago, a separate
module on Procurement and Contract
Management was delivered in Montserrat in
recognition of the dearth of skills and hence
the need to build expertise within the country.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Montserrat has further benefited from other
regional TA programs sponsored or
co-sponsored by CDB. In April 2011,
representatives from Montserrat participated
in a Public Sector Investment Planning
workshop jointly funded by CDB and the
Eastern Caribbean Central Bank designed to
build capacity in PSIP formulation,
implementation and management. During the
same month, the country also participated in
TA training to enhance long-term social and
economic development through improving
capacity for long-range planning.
In May, 2011, CDB Board of Directors
approved a soft loan to the Government of
Montserrat (GOM) in the amount of
USD2.5 million for the construction of a
permanent power station to provide efficient,
secure and reliable electricity services. This
loan was accompanied by a TA grant of
US$364,170 for institutional strengthening of
the Finance and Accounting Division of
Montserrat Utilities Limited. The total cost of
the project is estimated at USD13.4 million
with the United Kingdom Department for
International Development providing a grant
equivalent to 62% of the cost.
GOM has not borrowed externally since the
volcanic eruptions started in 1995 and as at
July 29, 2011, loans outstanding to CDB by
GOM totalled USD2.9 million.

ANNEX III. STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of November 15, 2011
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Macroeconomic statistics have some shortcomings, but are broadly adequate for
surveillance. There are shortcomings in coverage, accuracy, frequency, and timeliness. Priority
should be given to compilation and dissemination of labor market data.
Real Sector: National account data are based on the 1993 System on National Accounts. They
are compiled and disseminated annually; Montserrat does not disseminate quarterly GDP data.
Montserrat recently rebased its national accounts to base year 2006 for the period 2000 to 2009
and new GDP data have 2006 for the base year. The rebasing led to a significant increase in the
nominal GDP due to an extension of data compilation to previously underestimated sectors and
activities, for example communication. GDP data by type of expenditure are not available at
constant prices. Private final consumption expenditure is estimated as a residual. Monthly CPI
data are reported regularly but with a long lag. An important weakness of macroeconomic
statistics is the lack of appropriate labor market data.
External Sector Statistics: The Eastern Caribbean Central Bank monitors the external sector in
collaboration with member countries’ statistical offices. BOP data are published annually in a
format that is consistent with the fifth edition of the IMF Balance of Payments Manual. There are
no data on private external debt.
Government Finance Statistics: The data on central government finances are published by the
ECCB and are broadly in line with the methodology in the Government Finance Statistics Manual
1986. The data are published annually with a lag of approximate six months.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Monetary data are compiled by the ECCB on a monthly basis
and reported regularly to the Fund. There is a need to improve the institutional coverage that
currently only comprises the ECCB and commercial banks.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Montserrat does not participate in the General
No data ROSC is available.
Data Dissemination System.
III. Reporting to STA
The authorities do not report fiscal data for publication in IFS. The ECCB provides monetary and
financial statistics data to STA.
