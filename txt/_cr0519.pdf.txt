EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
A three-year arrangement under the PRGF, in an amount equivalent to SDR 80.45 million
(50 percent of quota) was approved on July 2, 2001. Four disbursements under this
arrangement have been made through December 2003. Staff held discussions on the fourth
review, as well as on the 2004 Article IV consultations, in Baku from October 13–27.
Macroeconomic developments remain broadly in line with program objectives. Real
GDP grew 9.9 percent in the first nine months of the year, and the real effective exchange
rate has remained broadly stable. Inflation has been higher than targeted. The non-oil deficit
for 2004, as a percentage of non-oil GDP, is projected to be one percent lower than targeted,
as a result of a favorable impact of tax administration reforms and tax policy changes.
Over the medium-term, the key challenge facing the authorities is to efficiently manage
the forthcoming massive but temporary surge in oil revenue. A long-term oil revenue
management strategy has been adopted by the authorities, targeting a path of non-oil deficits
over the medium-term that seeks to preserve macroeconomic stability and also avoid
overstretching implementation capacity. To ensure coherent fiscal policy, annual budgets
will need to start from the poverty reduction strategy, and incorporate the public investment
and regional development programs. Other key challenges include improving governance
and accelerating structural and institutional reforms to support growth in the non-oil sectors,
hopefully contributing to reducing poverty. Azerbaijan maintains an exchange system free
from restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions, except for restrictions maintained for security reasons which have been notified
to the Fund in accordance with Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51).
Performance under the program has been satisfactory. All quantitative performance
criteria under the program were met. The reserve money indicative targets were missed by
significant margins, and the indicative limits on unpaid government bills were exceeded by
small amounts. While several structural performance criteria were missed, policies subject to
most of them have now been implemented, following acceleration of structural reforms in
recent months.
Understandings were reached on a Supplementary Letter of Intent for 2005. Real GDP
is projected to grow by more than 20 percent, and the current account deficit to improve
sharply following completion of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil export pipeline. The program
targets a 2.4 percent increase in the non-oil fiscal deficit relative to non-oil GDP, which will
remain well under the long-term sustainable level, as well as a decline in inflation. To ensure
the latter is achieved, the program envisages utilization of ANB bills as an instrument for
sterilization, and acknowledges the possibility of modest nominal appreciation of the
exchange rate of the manat. The government’s structural reform agenda focuses on fostering
competition in the banking sector, in part by tendering all financial services of the treasury,
improving fiscal management through better budget preparation, and strengthening financial
discipline in the public sector by closer oversight of large state-owned companies.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The Executive Board completed the 2003 Article IV consultation with Azerbaijan on
May 14, 2003, and approved the request to complete the third review under the PRGF on
December 19, 2003. On both occasions, Directors commended the authorities for
implementing prudent financial policies, and urged them to develop a long-term strategy for
the use of oil revenues and to continue aggressive implementation of structural reforms.
Directors also stressed the importance of completing bank privatization and accelerating
energy sector restructuring.
2.
In the attached Supplementary Letter of Intent (SLOI), the authorities describe their
performance under the PRGF arrangement and their planned economic program for 2005,
and propose performance criteria and indicative targets for end-December 2004, end-March
2005, and end-April 2005. The authorities also request several waivers, an extension of the
PRGF arrangement through July 4, 2005, and cancellation of the previously planned sixth
review and correspondingly reduced access under the arrangement.
3.
Azerbaijan accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 effective
November 30, 2004, and is committed to maintain an exchange system free of restrictions in
making payments and transfers for current international transactions. Summaries of
Azerbaijan’s relations with the Fund and World Bank are provided in Appendices I and II,
respectively, and statistical issues are reviewed in Appendix III.
II. OVERVIEW
4.
Azerbaijan’s economy has been, and will continue to be, dominated by oil. Oil
and oil products comprised 86 percent of total 2003 exports; 2004 is expected to be similar.
In addition, massive oil and gas projects—in 2004, foreign direct investment (FDI) in these
projects will be equivalent to almost 40 percent of GDP—have played a major role in
Azerbaijan’s economy in recent years. Starting in 2005, as the first of these projects is
completed, oil exports will increase dramatically—from around 175,000 barrels per day now
to 1.25 million barrels per day by 2010. However, this surge will be temporary; by around
2024 exports will return to current levels. The management of this oil wealth presents the key
medium- and long-term challenge for the government of Azerbaijan.
5.
Azerbaijan’s macroeconomic performance in recent years has been impressive,
with strong growth, low inflation, and a stable exchange rate (Figure 1). Real GDP grew by
an annual average of over 10 percent during 2000–03, driven by oil-sector FDI and related
spillover effects in the construction and transportations sectors, substantial gains in
agriculture following land reform in the mid-1990s, and robust growth in non-oil exports
(primarily agriculture and chemical products). Except for the acceptance of the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, there have been no major developments in Azerbaijan’s
exchange system since the conclusion of the 2003 Article IV consultations.

6.
The National Bank of Azerbaijan (ANB) has continued its policy of informally
targeting the manat/U.S. dollar exchange rate to anchor the price level, allowing for
movements in this rate within a narrow band. Until recently, it targeted a gradual
depreciation in the nominal manat/U.S. dollar rate (2-4 percent a year), a policy that was
consistent with low, single-digit inflation. Starting in late 2003, however, foreign exchange
inflows increased considerably, due to higher FDI and exports, and the ANB has allowed for
modest nominal appreciation to counter increasing inflationary pressures (see below).
7.
Fiscal policy has been prudent since the start of the stabilization program in
1996, and the composition of expenditures has improved. The non-oil consolidated deficit
increased from more than 10 percent of non-oil GDP in 2001 to an average of about
15 percent during 2002-04—still well below the long-run sustainable level, as estimated in
the IMF Country Report No. 03/130. The authorities are paying increasing attention to
infrastructure investment, with domestically financed investment spending as a share of total
government spending (net of foreign financed spending and energy subsidies) increasing
from less than 5 percent in 1998 to over 17 percent in 2004. Fiscal and quasi-fiscal energy
subsidies have also been reduced sharply, from about 22 percent of GDP in 2000 to an
estimated 10 percent in 2003. The share of wages in total spending is relatively high and
rising, reflecting excessive government employment, but the level of public sector wages is
still low.
8.
Progress in structural reforms has been mixed, with periods of fast progress
followed by gridlock. In early 2001 the authorities embarked on a comprehensive structural
reform program, which was supported by a PRGF arrangement starting in July 2001. During
most of that year, the authorities aggressively pursued reforms designed to (i) improve
transparency of government spending, including by establishing clear rules for the operation
of the Oil Fund, creating a supreme audit institution, and including in the budget previously
quasi-fiscal energy-related subsidies (QFS); (ii) reform the Ministry of Tax (MOT) and State
Customs Committee (SCC); and (iii) start financial sector restructuring (IMF Country Report
No. 02/40). During 2002, key structural reforms in the energy and banking sectors were
delayed, and a number of ad-hoc decisions on spending Oil Fund assets were made.
Following an acceleration of reforms for most of 2003—enhancing financial discipline in the
energy sector, strengthening the budget preparation and implementation process, and
improving the business environment (IMF Country Report No. 04/9)— reforms stalled again
in late 2003. The authorities have recently resolved internal disputes on outstanding issues,
and the pace of structural reforms has picked up.
9.
The authorities face the challenge of managing the coming oil boom, with
government revenues from oil exports projected to grow about 65 percent in 2005, and by an
average of over 128 percent per year during 2006–09. Despite the recently adopted oil
revenue management strategy, designed to ensure the revenue windfall is managed
effectively, policy coordination remains weak and progress on energy and banking sector
reforms has been slow.

- 10 -

10.
Over the last few years, the Fund has supported Azerbaijan’s economic reforms
through the PRGF and Article IV consultations, and has provided technical assistance on a
wide range of issues. The authorities have continued their track record of effective use of this
assistance, although at times they have implemented the advice more slowly than
recommended. In recent years, this assistance has contributed to further development of the
Treasury system, a more modern and comprehensive Budget Systems Law, improved tax and
customs administration, strengthened banking supervision, improvements in national
accounts statistics, and most recently substantially improved banking sector legislation.
III. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PROGRAM
11.
Macroeconomic developments remain broadly in line with program objectives
(Tables 1–6). Real GDP grew 9.9 percent during January–September relative to the same
period of 2003, driven by oil-related FDI and strong growth in non-oil exports. The real
effective exchange rate has remained broadly stable, following a depreciation of about
8 percent in 2002 and 11 percent in 2003.
12.
However, inflation has been higher than targeted under the program. Foreign
exchange inflows increased considerably toward the end of 2003, due to greater domestic
expenditures of oil-related FDI and higher than projected oil and non-oil export revenues.
This created pressure for appreciation of the manat. Initially, the ANB increased unsterilized
purchases of foreign exchange to resist nominal appreciation. This led to a sharp acceleration
in reserve and broad money growth. Together with the impact of strong government wage
increases in the second half of 2003, this contributed to an acceleration in inflation from
1.9 percent at end-June 2003 to 3.6 percent at end-2003, and further to 6.8 percent at endApril 2004. To slow the growth in monetary aggregates, starting in March the ANB allowed
the nominal exchange rate to appreciate modestly, and began selling ANB bills in August.
While these steps helped slow reserve money growth, growth in monetary aggregates has
continued. Despite this growth, inflation declined, with 12-month inflation of 4.9 percent at
end-September, reflecting rapid remonetization.
13.
Reversing this trend, inflation accelerated sharply in October, with monthly
inflation of 4.4 percent. This acceleration seems to have been largely due to one time and
temporary factors: (i) the elimination on October 1 of the VAT exemption for imported
grain; (ii) price increases in advance of the expected increases in domestic energy product
prices; and (iii) the border closing by Russia due to security concerns (now reopened), which
resulted in temporarily higher prices for products imported through this border, primarily
meat products.
14.
Monetary and credit aggregates expanded rapidly in 2003 and the first nine
months of 2004. Following the purchases of foreign exchange by ANB noted above, the
12-month growth rate of manat reserve money accelerated from 11 percent at end-2002, to
24 percent and 38 percent, respectively, at end-2003 and end-September 2004. Deposit
growth was also strong, growing by nearly 70 percent in the 12 months through

- 11 -

end-September 2004, contributing to an increase of about 50 percent in bank lending,
albeit from a low base.
15.
Nonperforming loans increased slightly at end-2003 relative to end-2002, before
declining in the first half of 2004. Due to increased provisioning by banks, the ratio of
nonperforming loans net of provisions declined to 18 percent of capital at end-2003, from
28 percent at end-2002. Dollarization of the economy remains high, with the share of
foreign currency deposits to broad money at end-September 2004 increasing to 53 percent,
from 47 percent at end-2002, and the share of lending in foreign currency increasing from
67 percent to 76 percent by end-June 2004.1
16.
While interest rates have continued to decline, real lending rates remain well
above 10 percent. The spread between deposit and lending rates has increased, due
primarily to an increase in the share of lending going to small and medium-sized enterprises,
which are perceived to be riskier customers. The recently adopted Accounting Law, which
mandates the implementation of International Accounting Standards, should help in
assessing risks. The interest rate on treasury bills declined from 10.2 percent at end-2002 to
3.9 percent at end-September 2004, reflecting a sharp decline in the stock of treasury bills
outstanding, while the interest rate on recently introduced ANB bills stands at 4.3 percent.
17.
Fiscal policy was modestly expansionary in 2003, but tightened in 2004 due to
lower-than-budgeted expenditures and buoyant revenue. The latter reflects the positive
impact of tax administration reforms, as well as tax policy changes (the broadening of the
VAT base and simplification of the personal income tax schedule). A non-oil deficit of
14.4 of non-oil GDP is projected for 2004, 1.3 percent lower than targeted under the
program.
18.
There has been little improvement in SOCAR’s financial discipline. Despite much
higher-than-budgeted oil prices, its cash tax payments through the first three quarters of 2004
were below the budget target, as a larger share than projected was paid through tax credits
related to unpaid fuel deliveries to Azerenergy and Azerigas.
19.
Balance of payments developments remained positive in 2003 and the first half
of 2004. While the current account deficit increased to nearly 30 percent of GDP in 2003,
from just over 12 percent in 2002, and is expected to decline only modestly in 2004, this is
due to oil-related imports financed by FDI. Net of oil-related imports, the current account
remained in surplus (over 8 percent of GDP in 2003, up one percent from 2002), in part due
to growth in non-oil exports of nearly 45 percent.
20.
Performance against the quantitative targets under the program was
satisfactory, while performance against the structural targets was mixed. Most
1

Reasons for this dollarization are discussed in IMF Country Report No. 03/130.

- 12 -

end-2003, and end-March, end-June, and end-September 2004 quantitative targets were
met. Indicative reserve money targets were missed as money demand exceeded projections,
and the indicative limits on unpaid government bills were exceeded by modest amounts due
to small pension arrears (less than 0.1 percent of GDP, Table 7). While seven end-December
2003, and end-January, end-March and end-June 2004 structural performance criteria
were missed (Table 8), policies related to five have since been implemented through
adoptions of the Banking System Law (BSL), National Bank Law (NBL), revenue and
expenditure plans of key state-owned enterprises, and an oil revenue management strategy.2
21.
Policies called for in two structural performance criteria have not been implemented.
First, talks on selling a 20 percent government share in IBA to EBRD continue, albeit slowly.
As the authorities have been following a strategy of selling a stake in IBA to EBRD, and
only then selling the remaining government shares, it was impossible to meet the end-June
2004 performance criterion calling for the tendering of those remaining shares. Second, the
authorities have reversed their plans to introduce an automatic adjustment mechanism for
domestic oil product prices, as discussed below.
22.
The first annual report of Azerbaijan’s State Program for Poverty Reduction
and Economic Development (SPPRED) was completed in May 2004. As noted in the JSA
(EBD/04/104), the report reflects extensive consultation with civil society. The authorities
have made progress toward a number of SPPRED goals, including the preparation of a PIP
and an MTEF in support of the SPPRED, a strengthening of the links between the SPPRED
and MDGs (Table 9), and the introduction of a new household budget survey to improve
poverty analysis. However, the report’s impact on policy appears limited, and the links
between SPPRED objectives and the allocation of budget resources is weak. Some progress
has been made in alleviating poverty and reducing the disparities in income distribution.
However, with about 45 percent of the population below the poverty line at end-2002,
combating poverty remains a key challenge.
23.
The authorities’ anti-corruption efforts have focused on public sector management
and energy sector reforms, including enhancing the transparency of budget spending,
introducing a new tax code (2001), restructuring the MOT and SCC,3 and enhancing the
independence of the supreme audit institution. In addition, Azerbaijan is a pilot EITI country
(Box 1). While these reforms have increased transparency and reduced small-scale
corruption, progress in reducing large-scale corruption has been limited, and Azerbaijan’s

review.

In late 2002, the number of tax officials was reduced by 40 percent, and the salaries of the remaining
employees substantially increased.

ranking on corruption and governance indicators remains among the worst in the world.4 The
most recent manifestation of these problems is the reported monopolization of imports for
many goods.

Box 1. Azerbaijan and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI)
The EITI, put forth by the British Prime Minister in September 2002, aims to increase transparency in payments
and contributions made by companies to governments and government-linked entities for natural resource
extraction. Upon acceptance by Azerbaijan of the Initiative’s principles in June 2003, a national committee was
formed—with the participation of ministries, NGOs, and state and foreign oil companies—to lead its
implementation.
On November 24, 2004, a memorandum of understanding was signed by the EITI committee, NGOs, and oil
companies, according to which oil companies are expected to disclose payments. The memorandum also forms a
joint commission—with two representatives each from the national committee, NGOs, and oil companies—to
select an independent auditor to aggregate the data for the report, which is to cover 2003 and the first half of
2004, and is expected to be released by the end of the year. If so, Azerbaijan will be the first country to release
such a report.

IV. ARTICLE IV DISCUSSIONS
24.
Against the backdrop of solid macroeconomic performance but slow progress in
structural reforms, the Article IV discussions focused on medium-term challenges facing
Azerbaijan: (i) ensuring an effective management of the forthcoming increase in oil-related
revenues; (ii) accelerating structural and institutional reforms aimed at supporting sustainable
growth of the non-oil sectors and reducing poverty; and (iii) tackling governance issues. The
challenge facing Azerbaijan is daunting: no country as dependent on oil revenues as
Azerbaijan is today—before the forthcoming oil boom—has succeeded in managing that
revenue in a way that allowed for sustained, substantial growth of the non-oil sectors.
25.
The mission also discussed the authorities’ track record of implementing Fund
advice, and sought their views on improving the effectiveness of such advice. Key areas of
Fund policy advice, which the authorities have implemented in recent years, include the
design of the Oil Fund, the development of a new Budget Systems Law, and the
incorporation into the budget of what previously were quasi-fiscal subsidies, as a first step
toward their elimination. Two areas where the authorities have moved slower than
recommended by the staff include increasing domestic energy product prices and financial
sector reforms. The authorities emphasized that Fund policy advice and technical assistance
had been crucial to their success in achieving and maintaining macroeconomic stability,
improving the efficiency and transparency of their budgetary process, and strengthening

Azerbaijan as one of the seven most corrupt countries in the world.

- 14 -

macroeconomic statistics. They noted that while some policies based on Fund advice with
which they agree had been implemented more slowly than recommended, this reflected the
need to reach broad consensus within the government and civil society.
A. Medium-Term Macroeconomic Framework
26.
In light of the higher WEO medium-term forecast for oil prices, the mission discussed
a revised medium-term macroeconomic framework (Tables 1–6, and 10). It was agreed
that, consistent with the adopted long-run strategy for the use of oil revenue, the non-oil
fiscal deficit would increase by 2.4 percent of non-oil GDP in 2005,5 and 1 percent per year
through 2009, and gradually decline thereafter. There was consensus that this targeted path
of non-oil fiscal deficits would need to be revised—generally on an annual basis during the
budget preparation process—to reflect changes in oil export volumes and prices, and also the
need to maintain macroeconomic stability and avoid overtaxing implementation capacity.
27.
While based on a constant real annual spending of the oil wealth, the staff estimates
the sustainable level of non-oil fiscal deficit to be over 50 percent of non-oil GDP in 2004,
based on current WEO oil price projections, the authorities’ oil revenue management
strategy appropriately sets annual limits on the change in the non-oil deficit. Such limits
are needed to smooth fluctuations in the expenditure program, minimize Dutch disease
repercussions, and reduce waste of government resources given the limited institutional
capacity of the government.6

28.
The mission worked with the
authorities on a sensitivity analysis,
examining how higher or lower oil
prices would affect the sustainable
path of non-oil deficits (Figure 2). At
current WEO projections, which are
significantly higher than the baseline
scenario of US$20 per barrel, the
authorities can afford to increase the
non-oil deficit by 1 percent annually
through 2014, or by 2 percent through
2013. Even if oil prices fell to US$15

In the IMF Country Report No. 03/130 and in its extension (“Managing the Oil Wealth: The Case of
Azerbaijan,” Special Issue paper, 2004), the staff argued to cap fluctuations in the non-oil fiscal deficit in the
range of 1-2 percent annually.

- 15 -

per barrel—just over one-third of the current 2005 WEO projections—there would still be
room to increase the non-oil deficit through 2006.
B. Exchange Rate and Financial Sector Policies
29.
There was consensus that the use of the exchange rate as a nominal anchor has
served Azerbaijan well, contributing to achieving and maintaining low inflation while
protecting the competitiveness of the non-oil sector. Going forward, the staff noted that, as
the use of oil revenues increases, the government will be selling increasingly large amounts
of foreign exchange to the ANB. While the ANB should be able to sterilize some of these
foreign exchange purchases through sales of treasury bills and/or central bank bills, the stock
of such instruments is very limited and the market undeveloped. Sterilization also carries a
risk of crowding out the private sector. Given this, and the fact that the ANB is likely to be
able to sterilize only a modest portion of these foreign exchange purchases, the result will be
real appreciation pressure. Indeed, real appreciation will be the natural result of the
substantial increase in oil exports.
30.
The authorities will thus be confronted with the challenge of managing this real
appreciation. Staff strongly recommended that the authorities continue to target low
inflation, and allow the real appreciation to take place via nominal appreciation. To
protect the competitiveness of the non-oil sectors in the face of this real appreciation, staff
advised an acceleration of structural reforms, as well as gearing fiscal expenditures financed
by these oil revenues toward improving Azerbaijan’s economic infrastructure. The
authorities agreed with this recommendation, but noted that the change in policy to allow
nominal appreciation would need to be explained effectively to the public.
31.
The staff welcomed the ongoing remonetization, but noted that this process creates
two challenges for the ANB. First, a counterpart of this money growth has been a rapid
growth in credit, which could overwhelm banks’ ability to evaluate credit risk. The staff
emphasized the importance of strengthening banking supervision to ensure this growth does
not adversely affect the quality of banks’ portfolios. The officials agreed, but noted that this
increase in credit was from very low levels, and that they had started to implement the
recommendations of the recent FSAP missions to enforce prudential standards and improve
them over time (Box 2, FSSA and SLOI, paragraph 19). Second, as continuation of this
remonetization—particularly at the pace of recent years—cannot be assured, the ANB will
have to maintain a close eye on inflation pressures. The authorities emphasized their
commitment to maintain macroeconomic stability, and noted they are prepared to tighten
monetary policy if the remonetization process slows.
C. Medium-Term Fiscal Issues
32.
Given the understandings reached on the path of non-oil deficits over the medium
term, discussions focused on the composition of those deficits. As the spending of oil
revenues will result in real appreciation, with adverse consequences for the competitiveness
of non-oil sectors, staff emphasized that the increased deficit should come about through

- 16 -

policies that increase competitiveness. The authorities agreed and noted that (i) on the
spending side, in addition to poverty-alleviation expenditures, their priority will be to
improve infrastructure and human capital; and (ii) they will continue to reduce taxes on
non-oil sectors.
Box 2. Azerbaijan: Key FSAP Recommendations
•

Continue to strengthen the supervisory capacity of the ANB as recommended by the Basel
Core Principles Assessment and strictly enforce prudential requirements for all banks.

•

Strictly adhere to the scheduled privatization of state-owned banks.

•

Liberalize the market for the provision of all banking services to the government, by
contracting these services solely on the basis of transparent competitive tenders.

•

Amend the Law on Anti-Monopoly Activity to include: (i) provisions consistent with
international best practice covering all sectors of economic activity, including the financial
sector; and (ii) provisions to endow the ANB with approval/rejection and implementation
powers regarding the banking sector.

•

Establish an interagency committee with the responsibility to take measures to develop the
government securities market, including the conversion of the existing portfolio of long term
government securities on the ANB’s books into new government securities bearing marketbased interest rates.

•

Implement reform on corporate governance and accounting and auditing standards supported
by investment in training.

•

Improve the selection mechanism of judges and strengthen sanctions for illegal behavior.

•

Complete investment in the payment systems infrastructure for small payments and in rural
areas.

33.
The staff also discussed priority fiscal reform measures over the medium term.
There was consensus that to effectively manage the forthcoming surge in revenues, it is
essential to develop a coherent medium-term fiscal policy that starts from the poverty
reduction strategy, which should incorporate their regional development and oil revenue
management strategies. From this should come the medium-term expenditure framework and
public investment program, leading to the annual budget. The authorities agreed, but stressed
their need for technical assistance to accomplish this objective. The authorities requested a
new fiscal ROSC, to provide input into the development of the fiscal reform agenda, and also
expressed interest in receiving technical assistance to review their institutional regime for
collecting social pension fund contributions. Finally, the authorities agreed on the need to

- 17 -

reform public sector employment (streamline the government sector and decompress wage
scales), and continue to reduce energy-related QFS.7
34.
The staff urged the government to reconsider its handling of oil revenues. Currently,
oil revenue related to joint venture activities goes into the Oil Fund, while oil revenue from
SOCAR’s own activities goes to the state budget. While most SOCAR tax payments are used
to finance expenditures in the state budget, taxes due to higher oil prices than assumed in the
budget are earmarked for a stabilization account. The authorities acknowledged that this
treatment of oil revenues complicates efforts to focus fiscal policy on the non-oil deficit, but
noted that achieving a consensus on a more coherent approach would take time. In the
meantime, the rules for the operation of the stabilization account have been spelled out for
the first time in a Cabinet of Ministers’ instruction.
D. Other Article IV Issues
35.
The mission discussed the authorities’ plans to strengthen governance and
reduce corruption, in the context of the recent Law on Fighting Corruption and
Anti-Corruption Decree. Understandings were reached on measures to accelerate these
efforts: completing the separation of regulatory and economic functions of the government;
embarking on a comprehensive civil service reform; adopting international accounting
standards for all firms; and accelerating the restructuring of the major state-owned companies
(SLOI, paragraphs 37–39). Some officials expressed concern about the slow progress in SCC
reforms, including on improving the transparency of customs operations, particularly in light
of the reported recent monopolization of imports of numerous goods. However, no
understandings were reached on how to address these challenges.
36.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to a liberal trade and exchange
regime. While they have continued their negotiations for WTO membership, early accession
does not appear to be a high priority for the authorities. Outstanding WTO issues include low
domestic energy prices, which are regarded as subsidies to domestic production, and
regulation of natural monopolies. Azerbaijan’s Trade Restrictiveness Index is 1, or fully
open, and there have been no significant changes in trade policy in 2004.
37.
Finally, the mission discussed the economic benefits of a possible peace agreement
with Armenia. While the direct benefits might be limited, and delayed by the need to clear
mines, the indirect impact on investment from reduced uncertainty could be significant
(Box 3).

7

After requesting technical assistance on their reform program from FAD in mid-2004, SCC inexplicably
withdrew this request.

- 18 -

Box 3. Azerbaijan: Economic Implications of a Possible
Nagorno Karabakh Peace Agreement
Azerbaijan and Armenia were at war over Nagorno Karabakh from 1988 through 1994. While
a cease fire has prevailed since then, there has been no peace agreement. Assessing the economic
impact for Azerbaijan of a possible peace agreement, in the absence of its terms, is difficult.
However, some observations can be made with reasonable confidence.
First, a peace agreement would create a more attractive environment for investments in the nonoil sectors, and also lead to increased regional trade. A 2001 World Bank study estimated that a
peace agreement would increase Azerbaijan’s exports by 11 percent of 1999 levels, and raise its GDP
by 5 percent.8 However, this may be optimistic, as the prolonged dispute has prevented the
establishment of market-based economic links between the neighboring countries in the post-Soviet
period, and infrastructure connecting the countries has been damaged or destroyed.
Second, conflict resolution could improve access to the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic
(NAR), a part of Azerbaijan with around 367,000 people that is separated from the main territory by
Armenia. A peace agreement could enable Azerbaijan to use the southern railroad to deliver goods to
NAR—replacing the current expensive practices of delivering supplies by airplane or by truck
through Iran—and to supply gas through the existing pipelines through the territory of Armenia,
reducing the need for imported electricity.
However, resettlement or development of the region would have to await clearance of mines.
According to the Azerbaijan National Agency for Mine Action (a joint project of the Government of
Azerbaijan and UNDP), it may take 30 years to clear all mines in the territory. The economic returns
from peace, for both countries, could thus be substantially delayed.

38.
Azerbaijan provides core data to the Fund, and the information is adequate for
surveillance purposes and program monitoring. While the authorities have made significant
progress in improving the quality and timeliness of macroeconomic statistics, a number of
weaknesses need to be addressed in national accounts and price statistics. In these areas,
technical assistance continues to be provided by the Fund. Given Azerbaijan’s generally
strong record of implementing Fund technical assistance recommendations, continued
assistance is justified.
39.
The authorities have started the process of SDDS subscription, and are expected to
complete it in early 2005. The authorities have implemented all but one of the 2002
safeguards assessment recommendations (Appendix I).

V. PROGRAM DISCUSSIONS
A. Macroeconomic Framework for 2005
40.
Understandings were reached on a revised macroeconomic framework for 2005,
taking into account the WEO-projected higher oil prices and much better than forecast
performance of non-oil exports in 2003 and 2004. Although higher prices and volumes will
lead to significantly higher oil exports in 2005, and the non-oil deficit is projected to increase
significantly relative to 2004, there was agreement that the impact on aggregate demand will
be moderate, as most of the additional oil revenue will be sterilized in the Oil Fund or
stabilization fund, or transferred abroad in the form of capital and profit repatriation, there
will be a significant reduction in FDI next year, and the increases in oil product prices will
reduce QFS by an estimated 0.5 percent of non-oil GDP.
B. Exchange Rate and Financial Sector Policies
41.
While 2004 inflation is projected to be close to 10 percent, in large part due to recent
energy price increases and other temporary or one-time factors, it was agreed that the
underlying inflation was closer to 5 percent. Consistent with this, and with the authorities’
continuing commitment to control inflation, the agreed 2005 monetary program targets
inflation of 5 percent, and assumes a moderate decline in velocity. There was consensus that
a moderate nominal appreciation of the exchange rate will be needed in 2005, as well as a
further increase in the stock of ANB bills, to help slow the growth of monetary aggregates,
and thus achieve the inflation objective under the program.
42.
The authorities and staff will closely monitor inflation developments over the next
few months, and the ANB is committed to tightening monetary policy if necessary, in close
consultation with Fund staff.
43.
The staff expressed disappointment regarding the continued delay in privatizing
IBA, and urged the authorities to act aggressively to sell the remaining government shares in
that bank. The authorities noted their continued commitment to this privatization, and
indicated that EBRD was partly to blame for the prolonged discussions. To curb IBA’s
monopoly and create a level playing field in the banking sector, understandings were reached
on a comprehensive package of measures, including: (i) reversing the monopolization of key
financial sector activities by IBA, (SLOI, paragraphs 21 and 34); (ii) adopting a timetable to
bring IBA into compliance with all prudential requirements (SLOI, paragraph 20);
(iii) initiating steps for the privatization of BUS Bank (SLOI, paragraph 22); and
(iv) enhancing opportunities for other banks, (SLOI, paragraph 21). In view of the missed
performance criterion on the tender for IBA, understandings were reached that the actions
reversing IBA monopolies would be prior actions.

- 20 -

C. Fiscal Issues and 2005 Budget
44.
The 2005 budget targets a non-oil deficit of 16.8 percent of non-oil GDP,
2.4 percentage points higher than the expected 2004 outcome.9 The main fiscal policy
initiatives for 2005 include a 4 percentage point reduction in the social security contribution
rate to 25 percent; an increase in the wage bill of 36 percent, including a 25 percent increase
in the minimum wage;10 and a 45 percent increase in domestically financed investments.
45.
The mission expressed concern about the rapidly increasing wage bill, which follows
a 34 percent increase in the wage bill in 2004. As a result, as a share of total government
expenditures, wages and associated pension contributions have increased from roughly
30 percent in 2003 to 34 percent in the 2005 budget, despite the continuing low government
salaries.11 The authorities agreed that the high number of employees constrained their
flexibility to increase salaries, and intend to adopt in 2005 a comprehensive medium-term
strategy to reduce the size of public sector labor force (SLOI, paragraph 30). The mission,
while noting the need for capital improvements, also cautioned the authorities not to increase
capital expenditures too rapidly, for fear of overstretching their ability to monitor and control
these expenditures.
46.
Concurring with the staff’s position that the SPF revenue forecast in the budget is
optimistic, the authorities decided to postpone a planned pension increase until the SPF
revenue collections in the first quarter have been analyzed, and there are assurances the
annual revenue projections are indeed realistic (SLOI, paragraph 35).
47.
The 2005 budget law stipulates that SOCAR should pay in cash its full 2005 tax
liability, with credits related to fuel provided to Azerenergy and Azerigas applied to its
accumulated tax arrears.12 However, it appears SOCAR will clear its arrears by early 2005.
The staff advised the government that credits to SOCAR after its arrears have been cleared
9

This increase in the non-oil deficit includes 0.8 percent of non-oil GDP which is due to increases in domestic
excise and VAT revenue coming from the increase in domestic oil prices (see below). While for program
purposes oil revenue includes all revenue from SOCAR, FAD’s general guidance on non-oil deficits calls for
excluding domestic taxes from oil revenues, since these are sustainable.

10

Minimum wages were increased a cumulative 270 percent in three steps, on October 1, 2003, January 1,
2004, and July 1, 2004. The current minimum wage is 100,000 manat, or about US$20, per month.
11

Roughly one-third of government employees reportedly will be receiving the new minimum wage of
approximately US$25 per month.

12

SOCAR is obligated to provide the electricity and gas utilities sufficient fuel to meet their needs, even though
these companies cannot pay in full for that fuel. Since 2002, the government has reflected these underpayments
as subsidies from the budget to the utility companies, and has granted tax credits to SOCAR for the value of
these subsidies. In 2003 and 2004, SOCAR paid taxes in cash equal to the difference between these subsidies
and its legal tax liability.

- 21 -

should take the form of mandatory dividends; a final decision on this issue will be taken in
early 2005.
D. Energy Sector Reforms and Financial Discipline in State-Owned Enterprises
48.
The government noted it is not prepared to adopt an automatic oil product pricing
mechanism—a missed end-2003 performance criterion—due to concerns that such
a mechanism would lead to manipulation and hoarding in advance of effectively
pre-announced price changes. At the same time, acknowledging that domestic energy product
prices being significantly below world market levels is a problem, including due to the
implicit subsidies on these products by an estimated 3.7 percent of GDP in the first half of
2004, it agreed that a gradual increase in energy prices is necessary.
49.
The staff emphasized the value of an automatic pricing mechanism—one which takes
politics out of the price setting process—but recognized the legitimacy of the concerns about
the potential for artificial shortages. The authorities were considering significant increases in
selected products, including 50 percent for diesel fuel. The staff noted that the agriculture
sector was not sufficiently cushioned against the proposed diesel fuel price increase, and
urged increases in jet fuel and naphtha prices as well. The authorities considered these
concerns, and on November 2 announced 10-12 percent increase in the prices of virtually all
oil product prices, and a 120 percent increase in the price of natural gas for households
(SLOI, paragraph 13). As a result, natural gas prices will be roughly 85 percent of average
cost, gasoline prices will be close to import parity, and prices of other oil products will be
about 40-50 percent of reference prices. It was also agreed that, going forward, the
authorities will review, and revise as appropriate, domestic energy prices at least once a year;
this strategy has been made public.
50.
The authorities agreed that strengthening financial discipline in state-owned
enterprises is essential, but noted the difficulty they have had in monitoring and enforcing
their revenue and expenditure plans in 2004. Recognizing that failure to bring discipline into
these enterprises will undermine efforts to reduce QFS, but lacking clear ideas on how to
accomplish this goal, they committed to review the 2004 financial performance of these
enterprises—adding SOCAR to the list of enterprises being monitored (SLOI,
paragraph 37)—and, based on that analysis, take steps during the first quarter of 2005 to
strengthen their performance.
VI. BALANCE OF PAYMENTS OUTLOOK AND CAPACITY TO REPAY THE FUND
51.
The current account balance is expected to improve modestly in 2004 relative to
2003, as higher oil-related imports will be more than offset by higher oil exports. Non-oil
exports are also expected to grow, by almost 30 percent, led by agricultural and chemical
products. The current account deficit is expected to decline sharply in 2005, due to increased
oil export volumes and significantly lower oil-related imports, as major oil-related projects
are completed.

- 22 -

52.
Azerbaijan has serviced its debt to the Fund in a timely manner, and the staff
expects this to continue (Table 11). Domestic debt of the government is close to zero, and
external government and government-guaranteed debt is less than 20 percent of GDP, with a
significant portion on highly concessional terms.13 Azerbaijan’s risk of debt service
difficulties is thus low, with external debt service payments expected to amount to
3.7 percent of exports of goods and services in 2004, and projected to decline to an average
of 1.1 percent during 2005–10, as oil exports increase.
53.
Azerbaijan has debt disputes with Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.
While the status of debt negotiations with these countries is unchanged from what was
reported in IMF Country Report No. 03/154, a Turkish company obtained a judgment in
Turkish courts that led to the seizure of three freighters and two aircraft operated by Azeri
state-owned companies earlier in 2004, to force repayment of what they regarded as a stateguaranteed debt. Agreement has been reached on settling this debt.
VII. RISKS TO THE PROGRAM
54.
With the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline expected to start operations in 2005,
and oil prices expected to remain high in the near future, short-term risks to the program are
low. Over the medium-term, the economy remains vulnerable to a sharp and sustained drop
in oil prices, as continued high non-oil growth rates are predicated on removing existing
bottlenecks to growth through substantial investments in infrastructure and human capital,
financed by oil revenue. On the other hand, if the expected oil revenue materializes, there is a
risk of a relaxation of the steadfast implementation of the structural and institutional reforms
needed to support sustained, significant non-oil growth, and reduce poverty. Finally, failure
to improve governance would seriously undermine non-oil growth prospects.
VIII. PROGRAM MODALITIES
55.
Structural performance criteria and benchmarks for end-December 2004, and endMarch and end-April 2005 are summarized in Table 8 and described in the SLOI
(paragraph 44). Quantitative performance criteria for end-March 2005 and indicative targets
for end-December 2004 and end-March 2005 are specified in the SLOI, Table 1. The updated
disbursement schedule is presented in Table 12.
56.
The program contains a number of structural conditions, which the staff and
authorities believe are critical to the program’s success as explained in Box 4.

This makes it unnecessary to apply standard Fund templates for debt sustainability analysis.

Box 4. Structural Conditionality Streamlining Assessment
1. Coverage of Structural Conditionality in the Program
Structural Conditionality under the proposed program includes prior actions for the fourth review of
the PRGF, and performance criteria and benchmarks for end-December 2005, and end-March and
end-April 2005 as follows:
•

Fiscal policy, through one performance criterion and one benchmark aimed at improving the
annual budget process, strengthening links between SPPRED, MTEF, PIP and annual
budgets, and increase the efficiency of the government;

•

Banking sector reform, through two prior actions and one performance criterion to help
improve competition in the sector that is dominated by IBA, as well as a prior action on the
adoption of the NBL; and

•

Enterprise restructuring, through one prior action on domestic energy product pricing and
one benchmark to strengthen financial discipline in key state-owned enterprises and reduce
further energy-related subsidies.

2. Status of Structural Conditionality from Earlier Programs
See Table 8 for performance under the program so far.
3. Structural Areas Covered by Bank Lending and Conditionality
The World Bank is currently negotiating a three-year Poverty Reduction Strategy Credit. The
program includes conditionality on (i) public, social and financial sectors; (ii) reduction of implicit
subsidies, privatization, and regulatory reform of the utilities sectors; and (iii) private sector
development.

IX. STAFF APPRAISAL
57.
Azerbaijan’s macroeconomic performance remains strong, and economic
prospects are promising. Real GDP growth is expected to remain robust, driven by oil, oil
sector FDI, and associated spillover effects. Over the medium term, planned increases in
infrastructure and human capital spending, together with ongoing structural reforms aimed at
improving the business climate, increasing competition in the financial sector, and
strengthening financial discipline in the energy sector, are expected to reduce bottlenecks to
private sector investment and growth.
58.
The long-term oil revenue management strategy adopted recently is consistent
with a sustainable use of oil wealth and growth in non-oil sectors, as well as
maintenance of macroeconomic stability. The staff welcomes the fact that the 2005 budget
has been drafted based on this strategy. The authorities are encouraged to follow the path of

- 24 -

non-oil deficits in the strategy, resisting inevitable pressures for more rapid spending, not
only to conserve assets for the future, but also to avoid overstretching implementation
capacity. In this context, staff urges the authorities to limit increases in capital expenditures
to levels they can effectively monitor and control. A careful balance also needs to be struck
between increasing spending and reducing the non-oil tax burden. In addition, it will be
important for the authorities to begin the process of reducing the size of the civil service, so
that wage levels can be increased while containing the aggregate wage bill.
59.
The use of the exchange rate as a nominal anchor has, so far, served Azerbaijan
well, and the mix of financial policies has been broadly appropriate in recent years.
Looking forward, the use of the oil wealth will bring pressures for real appreciation which,
given the limited sterilization capability, should be accommodated by allowing a nominal
appreciation of the exchange rate. Such an accommodation should help the authorities
achieve their inflation objective, in particular by ensuring that the recent one-time and
temporary price pressures are not embedded in underlying inflation.
60.
The staff welcomes the authorities’ decision to participate in EITI. However,
governance weaknesses remain a serious concern, despite improvements since the
adoption of the PRGF-supported program in 2001. The staff urges the authorities to
accelerate progress in this area by completing separation of commercial and regulatory
functions, and improving the functioning of the courts. In addition, the staff urges the
authorities to aggressively tackle the governance problems in import markets.
61.
The incidence of poverty remains high, despite the strong real GDP growth and
macroeconomic stability of recent years. The staff is concerned that, unless the benefits of
economic reforms and increasing oil revenue are distributed across the population, support
for reforms will wane. The staff urges the authorities to increase pro-poor government
spending, speed up the identification of vulnerable groups, and design an efficient safety net
to cushion these groups against the adverse impact of reforms.
62.
While the pace of structural reforms has been slower than targeted under the
program, the recent acceleration in reforms is encouraging. Adoption of the new BSL
and NBL has created a legal framework that should enhance financial sector development. In
addition, the recent adjustment of domestic energy prices is important, although higher
increases in gasoline, jet fuel, and naphtha may have been warranted. The authorities are
urged to follow through with their commitment to review and adjust these prices as
necessary, at least once a year. The approval of 2004 revenue and expenditure plans of key
state-owned enterprises, and the commitment to add SOCAR to the list of companies
monitored in 2005, is a good start. The authorities are encouraged to review periodically their
performance, and take necessary steps to ensure improvement in their financial discipline,
which will be key to a further reduction in energy-related QFS.
63.
Although the staff is encouraged that steps have been taken to reduce the IBA
monopoly of segments of Azerbaijan’s financial sector, lack of progress in privatizing
IBA is disappointing. The staff urges the authorities to accelerate discussions with EBRD

- 25 -

for the sale of 20 percent of IBA shares, and to tender its remaining shares without delay, and
to quickly bring IBA into compliance with all prudential standards. The authorities are also
encouraged to continue BUS Bank restructuring, with a view to announce a tender in 2005
for the privatization of this bank, and to press ahead with reforms that will further reduce
IBA’s monopoly grip on financial markets in Azerbaijan.
64.
The staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to subscribe to SDDS in 2005. In
addition, in light of the authorities’ strong track record in effectively implementing
technical assistance recommendations, the staff supports continued technical assistance
to Azerbaijan. Priority areas for technical assistance should be budget preparation, tax
administration, implementation of the FSAP recommendations, and further improvements in
national accounts statistics.
65.
Going forward, the main risks facing Azerbaijan stem from the challenge of
managing the rapidly growing oil revenue in a manner that allows sustained and
substantial non-oil growth. Excessively rapid expenditures could result in waste, rising
governance problems, and real appreciation that undermines competitiveness of other
sectors. In addition, this rising revenue could undermine commitment to needed reforms,
particularly to improving governance and the business environment.
66.
The staff recommends completion of the fourth review under the PRGF
arrangement. Although there were delays in implementing targeted structural reforms,
policies subject to most missed performance criteria have now been implemented. While
actions on domestic energy prices were not as ambitious as programmed, they represent a
substantial step toward market pricing. Thus staff supports the authorities’ request for
waivers related to these performance criteria. Given the delay in completing the fourth
review, staff also supports the request to extend the arrangement to July 4, 2005, rephase the
fifth review to March 31, 2005, and cancel the sixth review and correspondingly reduce
access under the PRGF.
67.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Azerbaijan be held in
accordance with the provisions of the decision on consultation cycles approved on
July 15, 2002.

2005 5/
Budget
Prog.

Sources: Azeri authorities and Fund staff estimates and projections.
1/ Starting from 2002 includes SOCAR tax credits for energy subsidies.
2/ Investment expenditure increases by 1.2 percent of non-oil GDP (0.8 percent of GDP) in 2002 and by 2.4 percent of non-oil GDP (1.7 percent of GDP)
in 2003 due to an equity investment by the government in BTC Azerbaijan.
3/ Calculated by deducting Oil Fund, AIOC and SOCAR revenue from the consolidated government budget balance.
4/ In 2005, part of the increase in the non-oil deficit (0.8 percent of non-oil GDP) is due to the increase in domestic petroleum products. This is because our program
definition for oil revenue include both domestic and export revenue. Taxation of domestic petroleum products is, however, a sustainable source of revenue.
5/ The budget column reflects the draft 2005 budget submited to the Cabinet of Ministers (based on a US$25 per barrel oil price); the projection column reflects the staff
estimates of the submited budget on the basis of (i) latest WEO oil price projections (US$42.75 per barrel), and (ii) staff's revenue estimates of the proposed policies in
this budget.

ATTACHMENT I

December 6, 2004
Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street
Washington, DC 20431
Dear Mr. de Rato:
1.
On December 19, 2003, the IMF Executive Board completed the third review under
Azerbaijan’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement, which is in
support of our economic reform program. We would like to take this opportunity to inform
you about our continuing implementation of this program, as well as our policy intentions for
2005, and to request waivers for non-compliance with several structural performance criteria.
This letter should be read as additional to our original letter of intent and Memorandum of
Economic and Financial Policies, dated June 15, 2001, as well as our letters of February 6,
2002, April 23, 2003 and December 4, 2003.
2.
Our performance relative to the quantitative performance criteria and indicative
targets for end-2003, as well as end-March, end-June and end-September 2004, and the
proposed performance criteria and targets for end-December 2004, and end-March 2005 are
presented in Table 1. Performance relative to these targets and criteria should be measured as
detailed in Annex I of our April 23, 2003 letter. While the fourth review under our PRGF
arrangement was scheduled for completion by May 15, 2004 and the fifth review by August
15, 2004, difficulties discussed below have made adherence to this schedule impossible.
Therefore, we would like to request completion of the fourth review under our PRGF
arrangement, a rephasing of the fifth review so that it be completed on or after May 15, 2005
based on performance criteria for March 31, 2005. To accommodate this rephasing of
reviews, we also request an extension of the program to July 4, 2005, from the current
expiration date of March 31, 2005. The delays in completing the fourth review, as well as
delays in completing earlier reviews, make completion of the originally planned sixth review
impossible within the 4 year maximum life of a PRGF arrangement, and thus we also request
cancellation of the sixth review and a corresponding reduction in the size of our PRGF
arrangement.
3.
Our program policies and objectives described below are fully consistent with our
State Program for Poverty Reduction and Economic Development (SPPRED).
Recent Macroeconomic Developments
4.
Macroeconomic developments remain generally favorable, with strong real GDP
growth, a stable exchange rate, and continued accumulation of foreign assets by the National

- 42 -

ATTACHMENT I

Bank of Azerbaijan (ANB) and the State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan. Real GDP grew
11.2 percent in 2003 relative to 2002, and by 9.9 percent in the first nine months of 2004
compared to the same period a year earlier, reflecting the positive impact of prudent financial
policies and comprehensive structural reforms adopted by the government, high oil prices,
and continued strong foreign direct investments in the oil sector. Gross official reserves of
ANB increased to US$952 million at end-September 2004, and are now equivalent to almost
4.1 months of non-oil imports. Given that external debt and debt service remain relatively
low—with prospective public and publicly-guaranteed external debt about 17.5 percent of
GDP, and debt service at 2.3 percent of projected 2004 exports—these foreign assets provide
a comfortable cushion against adverse external shocks.
5.
Inflation remains moderate. Although there was an acceleration in consumer price
inflation late in 2003 that continued in early 2004, 12-month consumer price inflation has
recently declined from a peak of 6.8 percent as of end-April 2004, to 4.9 percent at endSeptember 2004, moderately higher than both the 3.3 percent at end-2003 and the program
target for 2004 of 2.5 percent. We believe four factors have contributed to this increase in
inflation: the increase in wages and pensions in the second half of 2003; the increase of
nearly 20 percent in imported wheat prices; the higher than expected domestic impact of oilsector FDI; and the significant depreciation of the U.S. dollar vis-à-vis most major currencies
in late-2003 which, given our policy of using the manat/U.S. dollar exchange rate as an
anchor for monetary policy, has produced a significant real effective depreciation of the
manat relative to our trading partners. The acceleration in inflation in October, when monthly
inflation reached 4.4 percent, we attribute to a number of one time factors, including
increases in advance of the expected upward adjustment in domestic energy product prices
and the temporary closure of the border with Russia.
6.
We continue our efforts to combat poverty. As detailed in the first annual report on
our SPPRED, completed in May 2004, poverty is estimated at 44.7 percent of our total
population, while the incidence of extreme poverty is almost 10 percent. While changes in
methodology between the two most recent household surveys make comparisons difficult,
we believe there has been some reduction in poverty, and are determined to reduce it further
in the coming years.
Performance Relative to Program Targets
7.
All end-2003, as well as end-March, end-June and end-September 2004
quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets were met with comfortable
margins, with two exceptions. The indicative reserve money targets were missed by
significant margins, in large part reflecting increased money demand, while the indicative
limit on unpaid government bills for end-March, end-June and end-September were exceeded
by less than 0.1 percent of GDP, due to modest arrears on pension payments.
8.
Our performance relative to our structural commitments under the PRGF
program has been mixed. We met most of our structural performance criteria and
benchmarks for end-December 2003: we established a single uniform enterprise profit tax;

- 43 -

ATTACHMENT I

replaced specific import duties with ad valorem duties as programmed; reduced the list of
VAT exemptions and required that future changes in such exemptions be done only in the
context of the annual budget preparation process; allocated tax credits to SOCAR and
subsidies to Azerenergy and Azerigas related to unpaid fuel consumed by the utilities on a
quarterly basis in 2003; and continued adherence to the reform program for the State
Customs Committee (SCC) through end-2003.
9.
However, there were a number of structural reforms that proved more difficult
to implement than we had anticipated, with the result that we missed several structural
performance criteria under the program. First, given the importance for our economic
future of a long term strategy for the use of oil revenues, we have taken time to ensure the
development of a strategy that is both well-designed and broadly supported. While we were
not able to meet the performance criterion calling for the adoption of such a strategy by endMarch 2004, our strategy was formally adopted by a Presidential decree in September, with
the resultant path of non-oil deficits presented in the draft presidential decree on the 2005
budget.
10.
Second, while we have made serious efforts during 2004 to begin the process of
increasing the financial discipline of, and government control over the operations of, large
state-owned enterprises, the process has been very difficult. We had committed to approve
the 2004 revenue and expenditure plans of Azerchemia, Azerenergy and Azerigas by
end-March 2004 (a structural performance criterion), but these companies had difficulty
producing plans satisfactory to the government, and thus were only able to complete this
approval process in April 2004. In addition, we have found it very hard to monitor and
enforce the implementation of these plans. However, these plans were approved, and we are
making efforts to strengthen our monitoring of the execution of these plans as discussed
below.
11.
Similarly, the process of revising the legislative foundation of our banking system
has proven more complicated and thus protracted than we anticipated, as we struggled
to balance the need for independence of the ANB with the need to ensure the transparency
and effective oversight of the ANB. Deciding how to meet both these needs took longer than
expected, and as a result we were not able to adopt the Banking System Law (BSL) by endDecember 2003, or to submit the National Bank Law (NBL) to parliament by end-December
2003 (both structural performance criteria). However, as a prior action for completing the
fourth review we have adopted a BSL, and will adopt an NBL, that are both consistent with
all Basle Core Principles (BCPs). Among other important features, the laws provide for a
level playing field in the banking sector, strengthen banks’ corporate governance, bolster the
central bank’s supervisory control, improve our ability to fight money laundering and
financing of terrorism, strengthen ANB’s independence in the formulation and execution of
monetary policy, improve the accountability of the ANB, enhance ANB transparency
through an inclusion of two independent members in its Board, and establish a clear
mechanism for distributing ANB’s profits. On this basis, we request waivers of the relevant
performance criteria.

- 44 -

ATTACHMENT I

12.
Also on the banking sector, the process of privatizing International Bank of
Azerbaijan (IBA) has gone slower than we had hoped. We had planned to sell 20 percent of
IBA to EBRD, and to then issue a tender for the sale of the government’s remaining
30.1 percent of the bank. While it was a structural performance criterion to issue this tender
by end-June 2004, the discussions on the sale to EBRD have not yet been completed, and
thus it proved impossible to meet this commitment. Nonetheless, we continue our efforts to
privatize IBA (discussed in paragraphs 20 and 21 below), and are taking steps to develop a
competitive banking system.
13.
Finally, while we recognize the importance of ensuring that domestic energy
product prices reflect world market prices, we have reconsidered our plans for how to
achieve this objective. We had committed to adopt a mechanism for the automatic adjustment
of domestic energy product prices by end-December 2003 (a structural performance
criterion). However, we are now concerned that such a process could lead to artificial
shortages in advance of what would be effectively pre-announced price changes. Thus, while
we remain committed to eventually bringing domestic prices into line with world market
prices, we have decided not to adopt such a mechanism at this time. Instead, as of
November 1 this year we increased the price of natural gas 127 percent, (bringing the
average price to roughly 85 percent average cost), which will be combined with an ambitious
program to provide gas meters for all households. We have also increased the price of
gasoline, diesel fuel, home heating fuel, kerosene, motor oil, industrial oil, turbine oil,
transformer oil, other types of oil, motor fuel, jet fuel, coke, naphtha (primary gasoline),
bitumen, and compression gasoline, depending on grade, by 10-12 percent, on average.
During the coming year, based on an analysis of the impact of these increases in the first half
of 2005, we will consider the next stage in revising these prices.
14.
In part to help cushion the most vulnerable in society against these price
increases, we increased the minimum wage from 60,000 to 100,000 manat per month on
July 1, 2004, and plan further increases in both the minimum wage and minimum pension in
2005. We have also included in the 2005 budget 34 billion manat to compensate vulnerable
groups for energy price increases.
15.
In addition to these one-time price changes, our intention is to review the domestic
prices of energy products at least once per year, in the context of the annual budget
preparation process, with the goal of first ensuring all prices at least cover production costs,
and then over time ensuring these prices more closely align with world market prices. We
have publicly announced this pricing strategy. Given the recently announced price increases,
and this long-term pricing strategy, we request a waiver of the performance criterion calling
for the adoption of an automatic adjustment mechanism.

Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies and Financial Sector Reforms
16.
Our macroeconomic targets and projections for 2005 reflect our continued
strong economic growth prospects. High export prices, the anticipated completion of the
Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil export pipeline and the first phase of the Azeri-ChiragGuneshli oil field, as well the continued investments in the Shah Deniz gas field and South
Caucasus gas pipeline are expected to produce roughly 25 percent growth in the hydrocarbon
sector of our economy in 2005, at the budgeted export price of oil of US$25 per barrel. At
the same time, reflecting the continuing broad-based growth of our economy, growth in other
sectors—particularly in agriculture, agro-processing, transport and telecommunications—are
projected to lead to a fifth consecutive year of over 10 percent growth in the nonhydrocarbon sectors of our economy.
17.
We also remain committed to macroeconomic stability, and in particular to
keeping inflation under control. While underlying inflation in 2004 is projected to be
5.0 percent, as a result of the increases in energy product prices discussed above, we expect
the actual inflation level to be somewhat higher. We are targeting 2005 inflation of
5.0 percent.
18.
The ANB has in recent years used the exchange rate of the manat to help anchor
the domestic price level; we believe this policy has served us well, as it has contributed to
low inflation, increasing international reserves and growing external competitiveness, as
reflected in the rapid growth of non-oil exports in recent years. Thus, we will continue to use
the nominal exchange rate as an anchor for the nominal variables of the economy. However,
we recognize that, as our use of oil revenues increases, appreciation of the real exchange rate
will be inevitable. We will ensure that this real appreciation does not come about via higher
inflation. In part as a result, we anticipate modest nominal appreciation in 2005. We will
monitor inflation trends carefully and, if developments indicate our new inflation target is in
jeopardy, we stand ready, in consultation with Fund staff, to tighten the stance of our fiscal
and monetary policies, as necessary. To enhance our ability to conduct monetary policy, we
have recently introduced Central Bank Bills. In addition, the Ministry of Finance and the
ANB will review the issue of the long-term government bonds currently held by the ANB,
with the aim of converting them into marketable securities. We aim to have a combined total
of 500 billion manat worth of Treasury and Central Bank Bills in circulation or held by the
ANB by end-2005, but will revise this plan as necessary based on financial market
developments.
19.
The ANB will continue to follow carefully the developments in the domestic credit
market, to ensure that the recent fast pace of credit growth does not undermine the
quality of commercial bank loan portfolios. While in 2003 the stock of outstanding
commercial bank loans increased by nearly 40 percent, the stock of nonperforming loans
increased only modestly, and the ratio of nonperforming loans net of provisions declined. In
the first half of 2004, there was a modest reduction in the stock on nonperforming loans,
despite a further 20 percent increase in the outstanding stock of credit. Notwithstanding these
encouraging developments, the ANB’s supervisors are paying particular attention during on-

- 46 -

ATTACHMENT I

site inspections to ensuring that the reported loan portfolio quality does indeed reflect the
underlying financial health of banks. In addition, based on the results of the recent FSAP
assessment, we intend to improve regulations related to banking supervision, as
recommended based on the detailed BCP assessment. We will also adopt a zero-tolerance
approach to violations of prudential regulations and impose stricter penalties for such
violations.
20.
We remain committed to the privatization of IBA. However, as the privatization of
IBA has proceeded more slowly than hoped, and as privatization alone will not solve all the
problems created by IBA’s effective monopoly of key portions of the financial markets, we
are embarking on a comprehensive program to improve corporate governance and enhance
competition in the banking sector. On corporate governance, as a prior action for completing
the fourth review the ANB—having taken into account possible recapitalization
opportunities in the future—has approved a timetable for ensuring that the IBA is in
compliance with all prudential requirements. In addition, during 2005 we will review the
operation of the IBA’s supervisory board, with a view to restructuring it so as to make it
more effective in light of the demands of the market and the new banking system law.
21.
To improve competition in the banking sector, consistent with our broader antimonopoly program, we have announced as a prior action for completing the fourth review
that, effective December 1, 2004, all banks have the right to serve as collection points for gas
and water bills, and that the respective utilities will cooperate with all participating banks. In
addition, following the experience with limited tendering for government financial services
in 2004, we have announced that, during January 2005, the government will issue a tender
for all financial services purchased by the Treasury.
22.
With regard to BUS Bank, the government and the ANB will jointly review, by endMarch 2005, the appropriate role for this institution in Azerbaijan’s financial markets. We
will also take steps to strengthen the management of this institution and issue a tender for its
sale during 2005. While we have recently removed the special credit constraints on this bank,
we will closely monitor its actions to ensure the bank does not take on excessive risks.
23.
Azerbaijan has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4,
effective November 30, 2004, following the removal of a few economically insignificant
restrictions that remained in our exchange system.
24.
The government and the ANB are in full agreement with the conclusions and
recommendations of the recent FSAP exercise. We are committed to implementing these
recommendations, which will help remove impediments to financial sector development in
Azerbaijan.

As noted above, in light of the importance of proper handling of the oil revenue that
Azerbaijan is receiving already, and the much greater oil revenues we will receive in coming

- 47 -

ATTACHMENT I

years, the government has designed a long term strategy for the management of oil
revenues; this strategy has been formally adopted through a Presidential Decree. The
strategy includes the following important principles: 1) We will seek to ensure constant real
expenditures of oil revenues over time, to enable all generations of Azeris to benefit from
this exhaustible resource. 2) Fiscal policy will focus on targeting the non-oil deficit (as a
share of non-oil GDP) as the best measure of the pace of spending of oil revenues. 3) While
the current non-oil deficit is well below the sustainable level of real expenditures of oil
wealth, we will gradually move toward that sustainable level, placing an annual ceiling on
the maximum change in the non-oil deficit, seeking to ensure continued macroeconomic
stability and efficiency of spending. We have ensured that the draft 2005 budget is consistent
with these principles. In addition, as a prior action for completion of the fourth review the
Cabinet of Ministers has issued an instruction that lays out a path of non-oil deficits through
2008, targeting a 2.4 percent of non-oil GDP increase in the non-oil deficit in 2005, and a
one percent increase in subsequent years. This instruction also clearly defines the important
concepts of oil revenue, non-oil deficit, and non-oil GDP. The calculations underlying these
targets will be revised at least once a year, in the context of the annual budget preparation
process, in light of developments in oil prices and volumes, but will always be based on
conservative assumptions of oil prices and volumes; the resulting path of non-oil deficits will
be included in the annual budget, along with our Medium Term Expenditure Framework
(MTEF).
26.
The strategy we have adopted thus provides guidance on how much oil revenue we
can afford to spend in any given time period. The strategy also provides guidance on how to
spend that money. We will focus our expenditures of oil revenue on our goals of reducing
poverty, encouraging growth in the non-oil sectors, and enhancing regional development, all
of which is consistent with our State Program for Poverty Reduction and Economic
Development (SPPRED). Thus, our expenditures will focus on infrastructure development,
improvements in health and education, and tax cuts for non-oil enterprises. Now that we have
developed this broad strategy, our next task will be to convert these principles into concrete
expenditure and tax plans, including through the further development of the MTEF and our
Public Investment Program (PIP).
27.
To further strengthen our budget preparation process, and the coherence of our fiscal
policies, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Development will conduct a
joint review of the process of preparing the 2005 budget, and before end-February 2005 will
present to the Cabinet of Ministers recommendations for steps to (1) improve the annual
budget preparation process, and (2) strengthen the ties between the SPPRED, MTEF, PIP,
regional development program, other programs related to fiscal policy and the annual budget.
28.
The oil revenue strategy and goals are reflected in the 2005 budget we have submitted
to parliament. On the tax side, the major reform in the 2005 budget is a reduction in the
Social Protection Fund (SPF) contribution rate from 29 percent (27 percent for
employers and 2 percent for employees) to a combined 25 percent (22 and 3 percent,
respectively). This lower rate could encourage job creation and will enhance the
competitiveness of our businesses. We have also eliminated the temporary VAT exemption

- 48 -

ATTACHMENT I

for grain effective October 1, 2004, and will not reintroduce such an exemption, and we have
reaffirmed our commitment not to introduce VAT exemptions outside the annual budget
process. On expenditures, we are sharply increasing domestically financed capital
expenditures (by almost 37 percent), with these expenditures focused primarily on
infrastructure investments.
29.
For stabilization purposes, we have established a special Ministry of Finance account
in the ANB, where tax revenues resulting directly from oil prices that are higher than
assumed in the budget are deposited, as a cushion against possible declines in oil prices.
However, to date there have been no formal rules covering this account. We have prepared
such rules and included them in the draft Presidential Decree on the 2005 budget.
30.
The 2005 budget also includes a substantial increase in the wage bill, largely
reflecting both the full year effect of the increase in the minimum wage to 100,000 manat in
July 2004 and the effect of the further increase in the minimum wage to 125,000 manat in
January 2005. Even at this new level, the minimum wage—which is paid to roughly onethird of all budgetary employees—will remain very low, at around US$25 per month.
Average government wages are also low. Despite these low wages, the wage bill for the
government—including the associated SPF contributions—has steadily grown as a share of
total expenditures, and stands at over 25 percent of total 2005 expenditures. We recognize
that, in order for the government to be able to eventually pay more reasonable wage levels, it
will be necessary to reduce the number of civil servants. We intend, during 2005, to design a
comprehensive medium-term civil service reform program, aimed at achieving this objective.
31.
The main area of reductions in expenditures in 2005 is in subsidies.
Improvements in Azerchemia’s financial position means that it no longer requires subsidies
from the government budget, while improved collection rates and the increased tariffs for
natural gas mean that Azerigas should be able to pay SOCAR in full for its gas consumption,
without subsidies. Subsidies to Azerenergy are also being reduced modestly (2.5 percent) in
2005, while the subsidy to Baku Metro has been reduced by 48 percent due to the doubling
of metro tariffs as of January 1, 2005. Finally, from April 1, 2005, we will increase tariffs for
water supply by 100 percent for households and 30 percent for budget organizations, to
enhance the financial position of the water companies and thus reduce their need for
subsidies.
32.
In 2003, for the first time, SOCAR paid its full legal tax liability, rather than a
negotiated tax target. However, SOCAR’s cash payments in 2003 were precisely what had
been assumed in the 2003 budget, and we expect the same outturn for 2004, despite the fact
that in both years oil prices were higher than assumed in the budget. The additional tax
liability was settled by applying more of SOCAR’s tax credits—for fuel delivered to
Azerenergy and Azerigas for which SOCAR was not paid by those utilities—to SOCAR’s
current tax liability, and less to settling accumulated tax arrears. To ensure that the budget
benefits from higher oil prices, we have included in the 2005 budget law a requirement that
SOCAR pay its full current legal tax liability in cash, using any tax credits to settle its
accumulated tax arrears, and we will require SOCAR to pay these outstanding arrears in full.

- 49 -

ATTACHMENT I

Once all SOCAR’s tax arrears have been cleared, any future credits will be in a form to be
determined, in consultation with Fund staff, before the end of the first quarter of 2005.
33.
On a related issue, through 2004 we have continued the practice of setting minimum
tax payment levels for large state-owned enterprises, to be imposed in the event tax
collections fall short of budget levels. Starting in 2005, these minimums have been
eliminated; in the future, all enterprises will be required to pay taxes strictly on the basis of
the tax laws.
34.
The state-owned airline AZAL has recently contracted to purchase four airplanes
from Airbus. In the context of the 2005 budget, the government will provide a capital
injection to AZAL to assist in paying for these planes. AZAL will be responsible for the
remaining cost of these planes; there will be no further budgetary expenditures to assist in
paying for these planes, subject to the provision of a government guarantee for credits to
finance the remaining cost as foreseen under the terms of the purchase and sales agreement.
35.
The reform of our pension system continues. Increasing efforts are under way to
develop an insurance and pension framework based on individual accounts and establishing a
direct relationship between contributions and pensions. The Social Protection Fund (SPF) has
arranged for ATM cards to be issued to pensioners, to enable them to receive their pensions
through electronic systems and ATMs. While in Baku these cards are being issued to
pensioners only through IBA, outside Baku we have opened the tendering process to all
banks. We have recently publicly clarified, as a prior action for completion of the fourth
review, that pensioners throughout the country—including in Baku—are free to choose
whichever payment outlet (including private commercial bank) they wish to receive their
pensions through, and that the ATM cards issued to pension recipients can be used at any
ATM in the country. We are also working to improve SPF revenue collections,
notwithstanding the reduction in SPF contribution rates. We believe that we will be
successful in this effort, both as a result of rising wages in the economy—including the
increase in the minimum wage—as well as improved administration and enforcement. We
recognize the risks inherent in budgeting on the basis of administrative improvements in
collections, and we will monitor the situation. The planned increase in minimum pensions
will only take place after we have monitored SPF revenues in the fourth quarter of 2004 and
the first quarter of 2005 and are confident on that basis that the annual revenue targets will be
met, and that the SPF has not only had success in clearing outstanding arrears but will be
able to avoid future arrears. The government will take any necessary measures to prevent
future accumulation of pension arrears.
36.
Our external debt levels remain modest, and we continue our policy of paying all
acknowledged government and government-guaranteed debts in a timely fashion. We
continue to seek a resolution of our debt disputes with Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and
Uzbekistan, and we have recently resolved a debt dispute with a Turkish company. A Law
on Public Debt has been prepared, with technical assistance from the Fund, and will be
submitted to parliament in 2005.

Other Structural Issues
37.
The revenue and expenditure plans for 2004 that we approved for Azerenergy,
Azerigas and Azerchemia were consistent with the subsidy allocations to these companies in
the 2004 budget. However, the monitoring and enforcement of these plans has proven
difficult. The Chamber of Accounts has recently completed, or is in the process of
conducting, audits of these companies. Based on the results of these audits, as well as the
implementation of their approved revenue and expenditure plans for 2004, the government
will take steps to strengthen the financial oversight of these companies. In addition, the
Ministry of Finance will, by the end of 2004, prepare reporting forms that these companies,
as well as SOCAR, will be required to use in reporting quarterly on the implementation of
their approved 2005 revenue and expenditure plans.
38.
We recognize the importance of continuing to strengthen governance in Azerbaijan.
Parliament approved an anti-corruption law in January 2004. This law requires that
government officials annually report their sources of income and total wealth, establishes
limits on the value of gifts government officials are allowed to receive, and prohibits public
officials from benefiting personally through the execution of their official duties. To
effectively implement this law, an anti-corruption committee was formed, and we have
adopted a comprehensive anti-corruption strategy that was prepared with the active
engagement of the international community and NGOs.
39.
Despite the steps we have already taken to improve the business environment, we
recognize the importance of continuing these efforts. While protecting the rights of the ANB
to inspect banks, the Ministry of Finance to inspect budgetary organizations, and the
Ministry of Tax to conduct necessary inspections to ensure compliance with the tax laws, we
will continue our efforts to reduce further any unnecessary and intrusive inspections of
businesses. We will also continue the process of simplifying business registration, including
by reducing the paperwork requirements and considering the establishment of a one-stop
registration process. Finally, during 2005 we will submit to parliament a new Investment
Law, which has been prepared in close cooperation with the staff of the World Bank.
40.
We are increasingly concerned about the artificial monopolization of domestic
markets for a large number of goods. We intend to strengthen our fight against monopolies
in three ways. First, we will accelerate the preparation of a new Anti-Monopoly Code, and
submit it to parliament during the first quarter of 2005, with the aim of strengthening our
efforts to create a competitive economy. Second, not awaiting the passage of this new Code,
we will review and revise as necessary our procedures for enforcing our anti-monopoly rules
and regulations. Finally, we will review developments regarding the apparent
monopolization of certain goods on the domestic market.
41.
We have started a major reform of the communications sector, aimed at separating the
regulatory and commercial functions within the Ministry of Communications and
Information Technologies (MCIT), and then privatizing its commercial activities. As a first
step, we plan to shift the responsibilities for the regulation of the telecommunications sector

- 51 -

ATTACHMENT I

to an independent unit (with its own charter) within the MCIT and then later to establish this
unit as an wholly independent government agency. We will also shortly begin the process of
privatizing the MCIT's participation in joint ventures and hope to complete this process by
end-2005. Next year we will also start the process of restructuring our domestic
telecommunications network (Aztelekom and Bakutelekom) with the aim of ultimately
privatizing it as well. It is hoped that these measures will materially improve the business
climate in the telecommunications sector and stimulate both domestic and foreign investment
into this industry, including into the regions.
42.
We will continue to implement a liberal trade policy. On April 1, 2004, the final
stage of the process of replacing specific with ad valorem customs duties was taken; as of
this date, only excisable products, cars and a few minor products continue to be subject to
specific customs duties, and the weighted average tariff has been reduced to 5.7 percent. The
second meeting of Azerbaijan's WTO accession working party met in October 2004 and good
progress was made. Work will now focus on issues of market access for goods and services
and agriculture. The next meeting of the working party is expected to take place in the
second half of 2005.
43.
We recognize the necessity of timely and accurate macroeconomic statistics. We will
thus continue our efforts to improve our statistical collection, analysis and reporting system.
We will review our need for assistance in this effort, and will request appropriate technical
assistance including from the Fund. As a result of the progress we have made in this effort,
we are now prepared to subscribe to the reporting standards of the Special Data
Dissemination Standards (SDDS) system during early 2005.
Program Monitoring
44.
Quantitative performance criteria and targets for end-December 2004, as well as endMarch, are detailed in Table 1.We propose that Cabinet of Ministers approval of revenue and
expenditure plans for Azerchemia, Azerenergy, Azerigas, and SOCAR, consistent with the
subsidy allocations in the 2005 budget, be a structural performance criterion for endDecember 2004. We also propose the following structural performance criterion for endMarch 2005: issuance of tenders for all financial services to be purchased by the Ministry of
Finance. We also propose one end-April structural performance criterion: adoption by the
Cabinet of Ministers of a plan to improve the annual budget preparation process, and
strengthen the connections between the SPPRED, MTEF, PIP and annual budget, based on
the review conducted by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic
Development, with this plan to be implemented during the preparation of the 2006 budget.
Finally, we propose the following structural benchmarks for end-March 2005: (1) in
accordance with the Law "On Public Service" dated July 21, 2000, to prepare legislation
providing for the recruitment of citizens to the civil service on a competitive basis and, based
on that legislation, setting a timetable for implementing comprehensive civil service reforms.
We remain committed to the phased implementation of this law, which foresees the broader
reform of the civil service. (2) Based on a review by the Cabinet of Ministers, in conjunction
with the Ministry of Economic Development, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Energy, and

- 52 -

ATTACHMENT I

Ministry of Taxes, of the financial performance of Azerchemia, Azerenergy, Azerigas and
SOCAR, adoption of decisions to strengthen the financial discipline and oversight of these
companies.
45.
The fifth review of our PRGF arrangement will focus on three areas: (1) continued
progress in energy reforms—particularly enhancing financial discipline of key state-owned
enterprises, controlling the subsidies to Azerenergy, and ensuring SOCAR pays its full legal
tax liability, consistent with the tax laws and the relevant provisions of the 2005 budget law;
(2) enhanced competition in financial markets, including progress toward the privatization of
IBA and BUS Bank; and (3) progress on strengthening the MTEF and PIP, as well as the
links between the MTEF, PIP, SPPRED, and the annual consolidated budget.
46.
The government and the ANB believe that the policies discussed above, combined
with the policies described in our previous letters and MEFP, are adequate to achieve the
objectives of the program, but we will take any further measures that may become
appropriate for the purpose. Azerbaijan will consult the Fund on the adoption of these
measures, and in advance of revisions to the policies discussed above, in accordance with
Fund policies on such consultation.

Safeguards Assessment

Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, National Bank of Azerbaijan (NBA) is
subject to an assessment with respect to the PRGF arrangement, which was approved on
July 6, 2001 and is scheduled to expire on March 31, 2005. A safeguards assessment of the
NBA was completed on March 8, 2002. The assessment concluded that risks may exist in the
legal structure and independence of the Central Bank, and in its internal audit and control
systems.

APPENDIX I

The authorities have implemented all but one of the 2002 safeguards assessment
recommendations. The newly adopted NBL clearly specifies the modalities for the ANB
profit distribution, consistent with one of the last two outstanding recommendations, and
requires that ANB’s internal audit division be responsible only to the chairman of the ANB
Board. The latter falls short of establishing an independent audit committee under the Board,
as recommended by the safeguards assessment mission.
8.

Exchange Rate Arrangements

The currency of Azerbaijan is the manat, which became sole legal tender on January 1, 1994.
Currently, the exchange rate is allowed to float against all currencies. Noncash exchange
rates are determined five times a week at the foreign exchange auctions conducted by the
Baku Interbank Currency Exchange (BICEX). Exchange rates for cash transactions are
quoted by commercial banks licensed to deal in foreign exchange on the basis of market
conditions. The NBA conducts the policy of informal exchange rate targeting and determines
an official exchange rate against the U.S. dollar every day, equal to a weighted average of all
foreign exchange markets, including the off-auction interbank market, the retail intra-bank
market, and the bank note market located in foreign exchange bureaus.
Azerbaijan has been classified by the staff with the group of countries whose exchange rate
regimes are managed floating with no pre-determined path for the exchange rate.

APPENDIX II

Azerbaijan: IMF-World Bank Relations
Partnership in Azerbaijan’s Development Strategy
•

The government’s poverty reduction strategy, embodied in its first full State Program
for Poverty Reduction and Economic Growth (SPPRED) was discussed by the IDA
and IMF Boards in May 2003. The strategy comprises six key strategic aims
identified as follows: (i) the facilitation of an enabling environment; (ii) the
maintenance of macroeconomic stability; (iii) the improvement in the quality of and
equity in access to basic health and education services; (iv) the improvement of
infrastructure (including roads, delivery of utility services, communications,
irrigation); (v) the reform of the current system of social protection to give a more
targeted, but effective protection to the vulnerable; and (vi) the improvement of the
living conditions and opportunities for the one million refugees and Internally
Displaced People (IDP) of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. While the PRSP’s overall
direction is considered appropriate, weaknesses were identified related to costing,
prioritizing, and sequencing measures as well as their monitoring and evaluation.

•

Macroeconomic management aims at maintaining a stable economic environment
through appropriate fiscal, monetary, exchange rate, and sustainable debt policies. In
support of these policies, the authorities are tightening payment discipline, especially
in the energy sector, hardening budget constraints for state-owned enterprises, and
pursuing enterprise and banking privatization and restructuring. Consistent
macroeconomic management has supported the economic recovery since 1995.
Nonetheless, maintaining strong growth will depend importantly on accelerating
structural reforms to enhance private sector development and to encourage foreign
and domestic investment, particularly in the non-oil sectors of the economy.

•

The IMF has taken the lead in assisting Azerbaijan in enhancing macroeconomic
stability and related structural reform measures. In this regard, the Fund has
encouraged the authorities to continue with fiscal reforms and to maintain a prudent
monetary policy stance. The government has also been encouraged to enhance
governance and strengthen financial discipline in the energy sector, to strengthen the
banking sector, and to improve the legal and regulatory environment for private
sector development. The Fund has supported Azerbaijan’s economic reform program
since 1995. The authorities were successful in achieving macroeconomic stabilization
under the economic reform program supported by the early IDA and IMF structural
adjustment arrangements, which formed the foundation for an ongoing Fundsupported program under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF),
approved by the Executive Board in July 2001, with the first review endorsed by the
Board on February 20, 2002, second review completed on May 15, 2003, and the
third review scheduled for December 19, 2003.

•

The World Bank has taken the lead in the policy dialogue on structural reforms,
including poverty reduction measures, public expenditures, agricultural policies,

- 59 -

APPENDIX II

private sector development, institution building and governance. A range of
instruments is used to conduct the dialogue. SAC-II, which has been fully disbursed
in June 2003 was supporting a wide-ranging structural reform agenda and its
accompanying second institution building and technical assistance credit (IBTA II) is
assisting institutional capacity building, especially of government budget preparation
and execution, privatization and utility reforms. The Bank has initiated discussions
with the authorities on the design of a proposed sequence of Poverty Reduction
Support Credits based on the reform agenda of the SPPRED and the CAS. The
objectives of the proposed PRSCs are to support proper management of public
resources, strengthen corporate governance, encourage non-oil trade and investments
and enable adequate regulation of utility services, while increasing the efficiency and
sustainability of social services. The proposed PRSCs ensure continuity of the
progress made with the support of SAC II.
•

This broad-based policy reform approach is combined with sector investment projects
in agriculture, roads, water, refugees/IDPs, environment, education, health and
domestic gas. Recent analytical and advisory assistance has included a Poverty
Assessment, a PER, a CPAR (procurement assessment), a CFAA (financial
accountability), pension reforms paper and ongoing work on trade facilitation and
mitigation of the social costs of utility price increases.

•

The next section describes the Bank program and the division of responsibility
between the two institutions. In a number of areas—social sectors and safety nets,
environment, governance, infrastructure, and agriculture—the Bank takes the lead in
the dialogue and there is no cross conditionality with the IMF-supported program.
The Bank is also leading the dialogue in private sector development and public
enterprise reform and Bank analysis serves as an input into the Fund program. In
other areas—energy, financial sector, public expenditure management, public sector,
trade and investment policy—both institutions work together and share cross
conditionality. Finally, in areas like monetary policy, tax policy and customs, the IMF
takes the lead with limited Bank involvement. (see Table 1).

APPENDIX II

IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
Areas in which the World Bank leads and there is no direct IMF involvement
•

These areas are the social sectors, agriculture, infrastructure and environment. In the
social sphere, the Bank has been involved in both improving the data and analyzing
poverty as well as in helping design pension reforms, and measures to mitigate the
social impact of utility reforms aimed at raising collections and tariffs. In education a
LIL is to be followed by an APL to improve quality. There is also an ongoing LIL in
the health sector (in partnership with UNICEF) which aims at building capacity of the
Ministry to carry out health care reforms and pilot them in selected districts.

•

In infrastructure, Bank lending to date has comprised projects for Gas Rehabilitation,
water supply and highways. An environment project is being followed by assistance
to build the capacity of the new Ministry of Environment and mainstreaming
environmental concerns across-the board, especially in the energy sector. In
Agriculture the Bank has provided credits for farm privatization, irrigation
rehabilitation and credit, extension and other agricultural services.

Areas in which the World Bank leads and its analysis serves as input into the IMF
program
•

The Bank leads the dialogue on structural reforms through the proposed PRSCs. The
PRSCs will initially focus on any follow-up reforms to SAC-II and will extend to
new reform initiatives. Bank leads in the areas of:

•

Privatization and Private Sector Development. The Bank is taking the lead in the
formulation of an integrated strategy and action plan for trade and private sector
development.14 An important element of the strategy is in providing a framework to
better integrate the efforts of key stakeholders—i.e., the government, multilateral and
bilateral donors, the private sector, and others—in promoting non-oil trade and
investment. The four broad policy components include: (i) Improving the Trade
Policy Regime and Market Access—creating a more export-friendly tariff structure,
accelerating Azerbaijan’s accession to the WTO, increasing access to regional
markets and the European Union; improving access to finance; streamlining
administrative procedures; (ii) Enhancing Trade Facilitation—streamlining and
strengthening customs procedures and improving the quality and capacity of
Azerbaijan’s transportation infrastructure; (iii) Improving the Macro Business
Environment - the macro business environment cover a wide range of issues
impacting on private sector development, including improving business registration

and licensing; land acquisition and site development; labor market policies; taxation;
access to credit; support for SMEs; contract enforcement and dispute settlement; and
public sector governance; and (iv) Developing Competitive Industry Clusters—
industry-specific strategies for improving inter-firm cooperation, promoting
innovation and quality, encouraging specialization and strengthening supply chains.
•

The Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) has recently conducted a diagnostic
study of the investment environment to determine the most important impediments to
private sector investments, and this was followed up by the CIS Business
Environment Enterprise Performance Survey 2002 (BEEPS) conducted by the Bank
and EBRD together.

•

IFC’s strategy emphasizes support to the non-oil sector to help economic
diversification. To this end, IFC will help catalyze FDI in non-oil sector projects
which focus on exports, help generate foreign exchange earnings and contribute to
the modernization of the country’s manufacturing base and basic infrastructure. IFC’s
strategy for the non-oil sectors involves: (i) promotion of competition in the banking
sector, establishment of joint ventures in the non-bank financial sector, technical
assistance to private local banks for institutional capacity building; (ii) improving
access to finance through credit lines to local private banks for on-lending to SMEs;
(iii) efforts to improve the business climate and reduce impediments to foreign
investments; (iv) support of agri-business and agro-processing; and (v) support for
private provision of public services.

•

As for privatization, the Bank provides support for hiring of financial technical and
legal advisors, advises on the transaction processes, and ensures that proper social
and environmental mitigation is taken into account. The Bank is also supporting the
development of a strategy for further industrial privatization as well as for labor
redeployment. Together with the EBRD, and in the context of the new proposed
PRSCs, the Bank is also planning to support financial and corporate restructuring
of SOCAR.

•

Regulatory Reforms, including approval of draft regulations for electricity, gas, and
water sectors, separation of regulatory and commercial functions in utilities, transport
and communications sectors, establishing an independent regulator agency assigned
with regulatory functions. In particular, all regulatory functions currently exercised
by Azal, Azeri Rail, Azeri Road Company and Caspian Shipping Company will be
transferred to the Ministry of Transport, the commercial and regulatory functions of
the Ministry of Communications will be separated, and remaining regulatory
functions of SOCAR will be transferred to the appropriate government institution.

•

While the Bank has taken the lead in privatization and in structural reforms in the
private sector as described above, the IMF has also a strong interest in these areas
since many of these reforms are critical to achieving macroeconomic stabilization and

- 65 -

APPENDIX II

enhancing growth prospects. Accordingly, there is a high degree of consultation and
coordination between the two institutions on these matters.
Areas of shared responsibility
•

The Bank and the Fund are working jointly in the following three main areas,
supported by the Bank’s SAC-II, the joint Bank/Fund Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP), several investment and technical assistance operations and the
Fund’s PRGF.

•

Public Expenditure Management. This area includes public expenditure
management reforms aimed at introduction of a medium-term expenditure framework
and public investment program a long-term oil revenue management strategy,
implementation of a new Budget Systems Law, consolidation of all extrabudgetary
resources including the Oil Fund with the state budget, modernization of the
Treasury, strengthening the Chamber of Accounts and supporting tax and customs
administration. Both institutions are involved in supporting treasury modernization,
while the Fund is providing technical assistance in support of tax and customs
operations. The governance framework for the Oil Fund is another area in which
there is very close cooperation, as well as the elimination of all quasi-fiscal subsidies.

•

Financial sector reforms. This area includes strengthening the competitiveness and
health of the banking system, privatization of state-owned banks, revision and
introduction of a new legal framework for the banking sector (banking law,
bankruptcy law, central bank law), development of manat financial markets,
including the market for T-bills and implementing IMF’s safeguards assessment’s
recommendations. Both institutions have conducted the first joint FSAP mission
during September, 2003, while the second and the last joint mission is scheduled to
take place in December 2003. In terms of banking supervision, the IMF is
monitoring the closure and merger of banks that do not satisfy prudential
requirements.

•

Utilities reform, including measures to reduce implicit subsidies in the electricity,
gas, and water sectors, to ensure full payment by budgetary institutions their utility
bills, to improve overall utility collections, revision of electricity and gas tariffs to
cover the true costs of providing these services. The Fund takes the lead in seeking to
ensure that budget organizations and state-owned enterprises pay their utility bills in
full and the budget fully funds remaining energy-related subsidies, while the Bank is
taking the lead in utility and state-owned enterprise reform, tariff revision and
collections from households, regulatory reform and privatization.

- 66 -

APPENDIX II

Areas in which the IMF leads and its analysis serves as input into the World Bank
program
•

The Fund leads the dialogue on fiscal matters, setting the overall ceiling on the
consolidated budget. In addition to the achievement of overall fiscal targets the Fundsupported PRGF includes performance criteria and structural benchmarks requiring:
(i) issuance of a tender for all remaining shares in IBA; (ii) issuance of tenders for all
financial services to be purchased by the Ministry of Finance; (iii) adoption of
decisions to strengthen the financial discipline and oversight of these companies, and
(iv) submission to the Cabinet of Ministers of a timetable for the design of a
comprehensive medium-term civil service reform program.

•

In the budgetary area the Fund is taking the lead on reforms of budgetary revenues
and expenditures to (i) complete the process of subjecting all taxpayers to the tax
legislation; (ii) improve procedures for revenue forecasting; (iii) improve tax and
customs administration; (iv) eliminate the earmarking of revenues for some extrabudgetary operations of budget organizations. In these areas, as well as monetary
policy, the Bank takes into account the policy recommendations of the IMF and
ensures that its own policy advice is consistent.

•

The Bank plays a central role in advising on development of a Medium Term
Expenditure Framework and Public Investment Program.

APPENDIX III

Azerbaijan: Statistical Issues
Although the authorities have made significant progress towards improving the quality and
timeliness of their macroeconomic statistics, a number of weaknesses need to be addressed,
particularly in the areas of national accounts and producer prices. In these areas, extensive
technical assistance has been provided by the Fund. It is important for the authorities to
persevere with the implementation of the recommendations derived from this assistance.
A data ROSC mission, which took place in May 2002, carried out a review of Azerbaijan’s
data dissemination practices against the GDDS, as well as an in-depth assessment of the
quality of national accounts, consumer price index (CPI), producer price index (PPI),
government finance, monetary, and balance of payments statistics. The Data ROSC module
is published on the IMF external website. Azerbaijan nominated a National SDDS
Coordinator in June 2004 and work towards SDDS subscription is proceeding well.
I. Real Sector
National Accounts Statistics
Peripatetic missions took place in Baku under STA’s two-year technical assistance project
on national accounts which are compiled by the State Statistics Committee (SSC). Progress
was made in a number of areas: (i) the methods for compiling the gross national income were
improved and the revised estimates disseminated; (ii) input-output tables for 2001 and
quarterly national account estimates at constant prices for 1998-2001 were compiled; (iii) the
data on capital investments were revised. The mission identified significant problems related
to the calculation of real growth in the construction sector. Due to the lack of a PPI for
construction, the SSC uses data on capital investment, which are considered to be more
reliable than data collected directly from companies, to calculate real growth of the
construction sector. . Fund staff agree with the SSC that the current approach to estimating
real growth of the construction sector needs to be seen as a temporary solution. The PPI for
construction is planned to be developed during 2004-2005. The national accounts peripatetic
project has been extended with two more missions aiming at improving the quality of the
quarterly national accounts compiled.
Price Statistics
The price department of the SSC intended to update the consumer basket of goods and
services and respective weights used for the compilation of the CPI. A STA mission visited
Baku in the middle of June, 2003 to assess the progress with the pilot CPI based on the new
weights prepared by the SSC. The mission assisted the staff of the SSC with the specification
for data processing for the new CPI and developed a preliminary list of approximately 550
market basket items. Procedures for estimating the market basket weights based on the

- 68 -

APPENDIX III

results of the 2002 household budget survey have been developed and the SSC will shortly
publish an updated CPI index based on these weights.
II. Fiscal Sector
The treasury system was overhauled with the assistance of an FAD resident advisor in 1998.
Steady improvements were made since then, and the adoption of a new budget classification
system in 2002 paved the way for a computerization project currently underway. Since 2001,
the government reports on quasi-fiscal activities in the energy sector and an estimate of these
operations was included in the 2003 budget. In 2002, for the first time, a consolidated budget
balance was produced. In 2003, the government amended its Budget System Law and, as a
result, the state budget is now submitted to parliament for approval at the paragraph level.
The recently published data ROSC recommends expanding the coverage of government
finance statistics by including all operations recorded by the treasury and to publish details
on financing and debt outstanding. Over the medium term the government should strive to
publish all fiscal data in a single publication showing budget and GFS presentations. Over
the medium term, the government should develop a plan for adopting the framework and
classification system as recommended in GFSM 2001 and strive to publish all fiscal data in
a single publication showing budget and GFS presentations.
III. Monetary Sector
A STA technical assistance mission visited Baku in May 2002 and found the monetary
statistics to be in full compliance with the GDDS and SDDS standards in terms of quality,
coverage and timeliness, with the following two exceptions. First, the mission recommended
that the chart of accounts for commercial banks be revised so as to allow a distinction
between commercial banks’ holdings of securities issued by residents and nonresidents.
Following the mission’s recommendation, the Azerbaijan National Bank (ANB) introduced
two sub-accounts in the chart of accounts for commercial banks. Second, some changes were
recommended to record properly the accounts of the IMF and other international financial
organizations in the balance sheet of the ANB. This recommendation has not been
implemented since according to the auditor (Price Waterhouse Coopers), the ANB’s chart of
accounts properly reflects these accounts. The mission also developed new report forms, to
reflect the adoption of new charts of accounts for the ANB and the commercial banks that
became effective in January 2003 and September 2002, respectively. These forms are now
used to generate automatically the analytical tables required for monitoring the PRGFsupported program. The ANB has recently started to issue its notes, which are categorized as
“other items net” in the ANB’s analytical accounts.
IV. External Sector
Balance of Payments (BOP): While the overall structure of the balance of payments statistics
was in broad conformity with the guidelines presented in the Balance of Payments Manual,
fifth edition, the Data ROSC mission in May 2002 found that there were several weaknesses

- 69 -

APPENDIX III

in the methodology of compilation including (i) an inadequate breakdown between FDI
equity and other capital which is necessary to properly record transactions associated with
the Baku-Tbilisi-Cayman Pipeline; (ii) undercoverage of nonguaranteed external debt; (iii)
poor data on FDI income in the oil sector; and (iv) misclassification of current transfers and
other liabilities transactions. A follow-up balance of payments mission in May 2004
provided further assistance in implementing the recommendations of the Data ROSC
mission, developing the ITRS reporting system, and improving the methodological
soundness of the public external debt data.
The ANB has made steady progress toward implementing the short-term measures
recommended by the Data ROSC mission. Almost all short-term measures have now been
completed; the methodology for compiling reserve assets has been revised to exclude the Oil
Fund assets and reclassify them into other investment assets of the government; a new survey
form for oil sector enterprises (IOCs) has been designed and distributed to international oil
consortia for their input; and the scope and classification of BOP statistics have been
improved. However, the provision of data from reporters, specifically from the IOCs, is
inadequate to compile the data on foreign direct investments. The estimations that are based
on the variety of assumptions result in inconsistencies arising from differences in timing,
coverage, and valuation of the source data.
To date, significant progress has been made in implementing the Data ROSC module’s
medium-term recommendations on balance of payments statistics. However, while
documentation on BOP sources and methods has been completed, its publication may be
delayed until later this year due to budgetary constraints. It is STA’s understanding that the
computerized compilation system recently implemented by the ANB is facing some
operational problems due to the lack of collaboration with other data-producing government
agencies such as the State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan Republic (SOFAZ).
International Investment Position (IIP): The ANB has initiated compilation of the IIP
statistics, but the IIP statement is still at an evolving stage. Starting from data for 2002, the
IIP is published in the IMF’s International Financial Statistics as a comprehensive statement
that comprises data on international reserves, FDI, portfolio investment, and other investment
assets and liabilities by sectors including the foreign assets of the State Oil Fund.
Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity: Monthly data on total official reserve assets and
daily ANB net interventions in the foreign exchange market are provided within 15 days of
the end of each month. Data on official reserves during the month are provided on request
from Fund staff. Azerbaijan does not disseminate the reserves template, but the ANB and the
government of Azerbaijan do not engage in any forward or futures transactions that could
give rise to contingent short-term net drains on foreign currency assets.
External Debt: External debt statistics for public and publicly guaranteed external debt are
reported on a quarterly basis with a lag of one to two months. A debt service schedule for
public and publicly guaranteed external debt separately identifying the principal and interest

- 70 -

APPENDIX III

components, is also provided with monthly periodicity and with a one quarter lag. However,
systematic information on nonguaranteed external debt, including a sectoral breakdown of
such debt, is lacking. The 2004 mission emphasized that the responsibility for compiling
external debt statistics be clearly assigned to a specific government agency. The authorities
are committed to strengthening the debt management system, including maintaining a
database on debt comprising not only public and publicly guaranteed external and domestic
debt, but also external and domestic debt of state-owned enterprises. The IMF plans to
provide technical assistance, including on the monitoring of private non-guaranteed external
debt, as part of the Regional TA Project for Public Debt Management initiated in September
2002.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
December 22, 2004
1.
The following information has become available since the issuance of the staff report.
It does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Macroeconomic developments remain consistent with program projections and
objectives. Real GDP grew 10 percent during January-November 2004 relative to the same
period in 2003. The CPI index increased 2.3 percent in November following the significant
administrative increase in domestic energy prices (staff report, ¶ 49). Net of the direct effect
of these energy price increases, inflation in November would have been 0.7 percent. The
nominal manat/US dollar exchange rate has remained stable. The growth in monetary
aggregates has slowed modestly, with annual manat reserve money growth declining to
about 33 percent at end-November, compared to 38 percent at end-September.
3.
There were four prior actions for the completion of the fourth review under the
PRGF, as summarized in Table 8 of the staff report. All have now been implemented, as
follows (i) the National Bank Law (NBL) has been adopted, as Parliament passed an NBL
consistent with staff advice on December 10, 2004, and the President signed the law on
December 21; (ii) the authorities informed the staff on December 15 that the policy of giving
all banks the right to serve as collection points for gas and water bills has been in effect for
some time, and the respective utilities also cooperate with all participating banks; (iii) a
medium-term path of non-oil deficits consistent with staff advice has been approved through
a Cabinet of Ministers’ instruction of December 6, 2004, specifying a 2.4 percent increase in
the non-oil fiscal deficit relative to non-oil GDP in 2005, and a one percent increase in
subsequent years through 2008; (iv) the authorities announced on December 7, 2004 that
pensioners are free to choose the payment outlet (including private commercial banks) they
wish to receive their pensions, and the ATM cards issued to pension recipients can now be
used at any ATM in the country.

IMF Executive Board Completes Fourth Review Under Azerbaijan Republic’s
PRGF Arrangement and Approves US$19.7 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the fourth review
of the Azerbaijan Republic's performance under the three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF) arrangement. In doing so, the Board approved a request for a waiver for the nonobservance of the structural performance criteria with respect to the adoption of a procedure for
future automatic adjustment of domestic energy prices, enactment of the Banking System Law,
and submission to the parliament of a new central bank law. The Board approved the authorities’
request to rephase the remaining disbursements, cancel the previously planned sixth review and
correspondingly reduce access under arrangement to SDR 67.58 million (about
US$103.6 million).
The Board also approved an extension of the arrangement from March 31, 2005 to July 4, 2005.
The IMF’s Executive Board approved the three-year arrangement on July 6, 2001 (see News
Brief No. 01/53) for an amount equivalent to SDR 80.45 million (about US$123.4 million).
Completion of the latest review will bring total disbursements under the arrangement to
SDR 54.71 million (about US$83.9 million).
Following the Executive Board's discussion on Azerbaijan, Mr. Águstin Carstens, Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, said:
“Azerbaijan’s macroeconomic performance under the Fund-supported program has been
commendable, with high broad-based GDP growth, relatively low inflation, and a strong external
position. The government has made further progress in structural reforms albeit with some
delays.
“The recently approved long-term oil revenue management strategy is consistent with a
sustainable use of oil wealth and the major macroeconomic objectives of the government,
including low inflation and sustainable growth of the non-oil sector.
“The continuation of policies aiming to maintain macroeconomic stability, together with further
advancement of structural reforms, is key to achieving the objectives under Azerbaijan’s State
Program for Poverty Reduction and Economic Development targeting an improvement in
competitiveness of the economy and a significant reduction in poverty.

-2-

“The 2005 budget targets a 2.4 percent of GDP increase in the non-oil deficit compared with the
expected 2004 outcome. This increase is broadly consistent with the authorities’ medium-term
strategy of a gradual increase in spending out of oil wealth, as well as with program
macroeconomic objectives for 2005.
“While the policy mix for 2005 is consistent with the authorities’ inflation objective of about
5 percent, inflation developments should be closely monitored and additional steps should be
taken, if necessary, in order to achieve the inflation objective.
“Progress is being made in financial sector reform. The new Banking System Law and the
recently adopted Azerbaijan National Bank Law reflect the recommendations of the recent
Financial Sector Assessment Program, and lay out sound legal foundations for operations of
commercial banks and for strengthening central bank independence. The adoption of a package
of measures to foster competition in the banking system is welcome. However, continued delays
in privatizing the two largest banks have slowed down the development of a competitive banking
system in Azerbaijan.
“The authorities’ decision to increase domestic prices of most energy products in
November 2004 is an important step toward reducing the gap between domestic and world
market energy prices. Adhering to the commitment to review energy prices at least once a year in
the context of the annual budget preparation process will be essential to reduce energy-related
quasi-fiscal subsidies.
“Resolute efforts are needed to carry forward the authorities’ structural reform agenda, which in
2005 will be geared toward further strengthening the financial discipline of state-owned
enterprises, elaborating a civil service reform strategy, improving the annual budget preparation
process, and tackling monopolistic tendencies in the banking sector. Continued efforts will also
be needed to strengthen governance, including through fully implementing the recent Law on
Fighting Corruption and Anti-Corruption Decree, especially in view of the importance of
ensuring sound management and use of oil wealth,” Mr. Carstens said.
The PRGF is the IMF’s concessional facility for low-income countries. PRGF-supported
programs are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory
process involving civil society and development partners, and articulated in a Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper, or PRSP. This is intended to ensure that each PRGF-supported program is
consistent with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural, and social policies,
to foster growth and reduce poverty. PRGF loans carry an annual interest rate of 0.5 percent, and
are repayable over 10 years with a 5 ½-year grace period on principal payments.

Statement by Fritz Zurbrügg Executive Director for Azerbaijan Republic
and Faig Mammadov Advisor to Executive Director
December 22, 2004
Our Azerbaijan authorities continue to value the strong cooperation with the Fund and
appreciate the staff’s support and policy advice. The comprehensive set of papers covering
the Article IV Consultations, the fourth PRGF review, as well as the assessment of the
financial system provide an in-depth analysis of the current macroeconomic and financial
situation. Our authorities are very satisfied with the continued positive developments of the
main macroeconomic indicators. Strong growth in both the oil and non-oil sectors, moderate
inflation, growing international reserves, as well as a disciplined fiscal policy stance
underscore Azerbaijan’s success in sustaining sound macroeconomic performance. All
quantitative performance criteria for end-2003, and end-March, end-June, and end-September
2004 were met.
The authorities are fully aware of the important challenges that remain in the area of
structural reforms to ensure that this performance can be maintained over the medium and
long term and that it translates into a significant reduction of the existing poverty levels. Our
authorities recognize that the implementation of structural measures has been slower than
envisaged under the program. However, it was important to garner sufficiently broad support
for these difficult measures. Our authorities are confident that the adoption of the long-term
oil revenue management strategy, the adoption of the National Bank Law, and the
implementation of the State Program for the Regional Development, which has already
resulted in the creation of more than 80,000 new jobs during the last year, are crucial steps in
moving forward the structural reform agenda.
Fiscal Policy
Fiscal policy was tight and broadly in line with the program’s objectives. The main
objectives of the authorities were to reduce the overall tax burden, broaden the tax base, and
stimulate investment activity in the economy. Notwithstanding reductions of social security
contribution rates and other measures aimed at further optimizing the tax levels, revenues of
the state budget increased significantly. In line with the recently adopted strategy for the
management of oil revenues, and despite high oil prices and large capital inflows, Azerbaijan
has demonstrated a solid track record of sound fiscal policy by maintaining a sustainable
level of the overall and non-oil deficits. Furthermore, in line with prudent budgetary
management rules, excess inflows of revenues resulting from higher than budgeted oil prices
are accumulated in the special stabilization account at the treasury. While the authorities had
intended to establish the rules for the operation of this account in the Presidential Decree of
the 2005 Budget, it was deemed to be more appropriate to include them in a Cabinet of
Ministers regulation.
The important and politically difficult recent increase in energy prices will help further
reduce subsidies in this area and improve effectiveness in the management of the public
utilities. The authorities remain committed to gradually move energy prices to cost recovery
levels.

-2-

The implementation of the State Program for Poverty Reduction and Economic Growth
(SPPRED) and other policy decisions aimed at strengthening economic growth while
maintaining macroeconomic stability, are reflected in the spending priorities. With minimum
wage increases and other measures in 2004, the budget has become more oriented toward the
poverty reduction objectives. Capital expenditure from the budget also continues to rise
significantly in 2005.
Fiscal transparency in hydrocarbon activity is a long-term commitment of the Azerbaijani
authorities. The State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan continues to accumulate and manage the oil
and gas related revenues in a prudent manner. As summarized in Box 1, Azerbaijan is a
strong supporter of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Working in close
cooperation with the industry and civil society representatives, it is one of the first countries
to agree to the EITI reporting mechanisms. Furthermore, by adopting the Accounting Law,
reporting standards of the state owned enterprises (SOEs) will also be improved substantially
and brought in conformity with international standards.
Monetary Policy
Several factors have increased inflationary pressures, such as strong foreign currency inflows
and general economic growth, increased minimum wages and targeted support, higher oil and
import prices. The authorities see their primary task in ensuring that these factors do not lead
to a breach of single digit inflation levels, which have been successfully maintained for the
last years. This is reflected in the 5 percent inflation rate targeted in the monetary program
for 2005.
Our authorities are glad to note that Azerbaijan has accepted the obligations under Article
VIII Sections 2, 3, and 4. They are also intensively working with the Fund and other partners
in developing, institutionalizing and operationalizing the AML/CFT framework.
Recommendations of the FSAP are being taken on board in the conduct of the monetary and
financial sector policies.
Financial Sector Policy
The development of the whole spectrum of the financial services has continued together with
the improvement of key performance indicators in the sector. The annual growth rate of
banking credit to the economy has increased from 32 percent in 2003 to about 50 percent this
year and underscores the strengthening of financial intermediation. The growth of the
banking sector assets by 45 percent (US$1.5bn in 2004) and a decline of NPLs points to
further improvement in the quality of lending. Although interest rates on deposits continued
to decline, the rising level of banking deposits by 50 percent in the last 11 months
demonstrates on the one hand an increasing confidence of the population in the banking
sector, and on the other hand indicates the rising income levels. Structural changes in the
banking sector will continue through further consolidation and greater foreign participation.

-3The new Banking System and Central Bank Laws prepared in coordination with the Fund has
significantly strengthened the banking sector legislation. The authorities are confident that
this will provide the basis to improve the quality of the financial sector in Azerbaijan, in
particular given the strengthening of the supervisory framework.
Structural Policy
Strengthening the operational effectiveness and financial management at the large SOEs has
continued. As noted in the LOI, quarterly reporting on the annually approved budgets of
these organizations will further be ensured with the aim to eventually moving all public
utilities towards the full cost recovery.
Creation of favorable conditions and supporting development of the non-oil sector represents
one of the highest priorities of the authorities. The implementation of a comprehensive
regional development program, focusing on the development of both business and physical
infrastructure in the regions and rural area, as well as easing the tax burden and improving
the business climate resulted in the opening of hundreds of new enterprises throughout the
country.
The adoption of the Law on Civil Services, the implementation of Anti-Corruption
legislation, the preparation of the Competition Law, and the continuing privatization are part
of the efforts to improve governance and the rule of law. The adoption of the Accounting
Law and introduction of the international reporting standards starting January 2005, as well
as the rise in the salaries of the civil workers and strengthening of internal controls will also
contribute to the improved governance.

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with the Azerbaijan Republic
On December 22, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Azerbaijan Republic.1
Background
A three-year arrangement under the PRGF, in an amount equivalent to SDR 80.45 million
(50 percent of quota) was approved on July 2, 2001. Four disbursements under this
arrangement have been made through December 2003.
Economic developments in Azerbaijan in recent years have been characterized by strong
growth and low inflation. Real GDP grew by an annual average of over 10 percent during
2000-03, driven by oil-sector FDI and related spillover effects in the construction and
transportation sectors, substantial gains in agriculture following land reform in the mid-1990s,
and robust growth in non-oil exports (primarily agriculture and chemical products). Inflation
remained low, despite the recent pick up. The real effective exchange rate, which depreciated
by 11 percent in 2003, has remained broadly stable in 2004. As of end September 2003, the
gross international reserves of the National bank of Azerbaijan (ANB) amounted to
US$952 million, providing for over 4.1 months of prospective non-oil import coverage, and the
deposits of the State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ) reached around US$900 million.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2Fiscal policy was moderately expansionary in 2003, but tightened in 2004 due to lower-thanbudgeted expenditure and strong performance in tax revenue, reflecting the positive impact of
tax administration reforms as well as tax policy changes. As a result, the 2004 non-oil deficit as
a share of non-oil GDP is now expected to be lower than previously projected. The 2005 budget
targets a non-oil deficit of 16.8 percent of non-oil GDP, which is 2.4 percentage points higher
than the expected 2004 outcome, but still well below the estimated long-run sustainable level.
While the share of wages in total spending is relatively high and rising, reflecting excessive
government employment, the level of public sector wages is still low.
Monetary and credit aggregates expanded rapidly in 2003 and the first nine months of 2004,
following the ANB’s unsterilized purchases of foreign exchange inflows to resist nominal
appreciation. Together with the impact of strong government wage increases in the second half
of 2003, this contributed to an acceleration in inflation to 6.8 percent at end-April 2004. To slow
the growth in monetary aggregates, starting in March, the ANB allowed the nominal exchange
rate to appreciate modestly, and began selling ANB bills. These steps helped slow reserve
money growth and inflation declined to 4.9 percent at end-September. Utilization of ANB bills as
an instrument for sterilization should help the ANB to control inflation, which picked up in
October largely due to one time factors.
Deposit growth was nearly 70 percent in the 12 months through end-September 2004, leading
to a significant increase in bank lending, albeit from a low base. Nonperforming loans increased
slightly at end-2003 relative to end-2002, before declining in the first half of 2004. Nominal
Interest rates have continued to decline.
Balance of payment developments remained positive in 2003 and the first half of 2004.
The current account deficit increased to nearly 30 percent of GDP in 2003, from just over
12 percent in 2002, and is expected to decline only modestly in 2004, due to oil-related imports
financed by FDI. Non-oil exports grew by nearly 45 percent. Public and publicly guaranteed
external debt in percent of GDP is projected to decline to 18 percent by end-2004 and 2005,
compared to 20 percent at end-2003.
Structural reforms, which slowed in late 2003 and early 2004, accelerated again recently.
The authorities adopted a long-term oil revenue management strategy, which is consistent with
a sustainable use of oil wealth and growth in non-oil sectors, as well as maintenance of
macroeconomic stability. The 2005 budget was based on this strategy. The new Banking
System Law is a substantial improvement over the previous one, allowing the authorities to
implement many of the Basel Core Principles’ recommendations by amending relevant ANB
regulations. The newly adopted National Bank Law is consistent with international best
practices and calls for higher transparency, improved corporate governance and strengthened
ANB independence in banking supervision. The authorities’ recent decision to adjust domestic
prices of energy products and commit to review and adjust these prices as necessary, at least
once a year, is an important step towards reduction of energy-related subsidies and
improvement of efficiency in the energy sector.

-3The first annual report of Azerbaijan’s State Program for Poverty Reduction and Economic
Development, reflecting extensive consultation with civil society, was completed in May 2004.
While some progress has been made in alleviating poverty and reducing the disparities in
income distribution, combating poverty remains a key challenge in Azerbaijan.
Azerbaijan accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 effective
November 30, 2004, and is committed to maintain an exchange system free of restrictions in
making payments and transfers for current international transactions.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the authorities for Azerbaijan’s strong macroeconomic performance in
recent years reflected in double-digit broad-based GDP growth; rising gross international
reserves and savings in the Oil Fund; declining external debt ratios; and relatively low inflation.
Directors noted that, while this positive outcome is in part attributable to favorable external
factors, including high oil prices and large oil-related FDI, it also reflects prudent financial
policies and some progress in structural reforms. Directors expressed concern, however, that—
despite the high real GDP growth—the incidence of poverty remains high.
Directors agreed that the main challenge facing the Azerbaijan authorities over the mediumand long-term is to manage effectively a large but temporary surge in oil revenue. In this
context, they welcomed the recent adoption of a long-term strategy for the use of oil revenue,
which calls for maintaining oil wealth constant in real terms and limiting annual fluctuations in
non-oil fiscal deficits. Establishing a sound, transparent fiscal framework was seen as essential
for enabling the country’s oil wealth to support the sustainable development of the non-oil sector
and poverty reduction. In this connection, Directors also underscored the need to strengthen the
implementation of the structural agenda, which aims at reducing rigidities, diversifying the
economy, and creating an investor-friendly environment. They attached particular importance to
enhancing reforms in the financial and energy sectors and improving governance.
Directors supported the government’s decision to increase non-oil fiscal deficits gradually over
the next three years, consistent with the oil revenue management strategy, as well as with
macroeconomic stability and expenditure implementation capacity. They also emphasized that
the planned increases in the non-oil fiscal deficits over the medium term should involve a
combination of expenditure increases in physical and human capital, as well as tax cuts
targeted to non-oil sectors, in order to improve the competitiveness of Azerbaijan’s economy.
Furthermore, Directors urged the authorities to design and implement targeted social
assistance, and increase pro-poor government spending to cushion vulnerable groups against
the adverse impact of reforms. In addition, they underscored the need for a comprehensive civil
service reform to ensure a steady increase in wages while containing the wage bill.
Directors noted the government’s approval of revenue and expenditure plans for major stateowned enterprises in 2004 and the authorities’ commitment to add the State Oil Company of the
Azerbaijan Republic to the list of monitored enterprises in 2005. They encouraged the
authorities to use these plans to strengthen monitoring of these enterprises and take necessary

-4steps to improve their financial performance, in particular in the energy sector. Directors
stressed the need to improve financial discipline and transparency in state-owned enterprises,
in order to reduce continuing quasi-fiscal subsidies to them.
Directors were encouraged by recent progress in reducing gaps between domestic and world
market energy prices. However, they noted that related fiscal and quasi-fiscal subsidies
remained high, despite the significant progress made in recent years. In this regard, Directors
were encouraged by the authorities’ commitment to review domestic energy prices at least once
a year in the context of the annual budget process, with an objective of gradually aligning them
with world market levels. Some Directors, however, urged the authorities to consider the
adoption of an automatic price adjustment mechanism while mitigating any adverse effects on
the poor.
Directors were encouraged by the progress made in implementing Azerbaijan’s State Program
for Poverty Reduction and Economic Development (SPPRED), including the preparation of a
Medium-Term Expenditure Framework and Public Investment Program in support of the
SPPRED. They noted, however, that links between the SPPRED objectives and the annual
budget should be strengthened, and recommended the adoption of a comprehensive strategy to
address the current weaknesses in early 2005.
Directors welcomed Azerbaijan’s participation in the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative, but noted that limited progress has been made toward improving governance in other
areas. They considered that corruption remains a significant problem in Azerbaijan. Directors,
therefore, encouraged the authorities to fully implement the recent Law on Fighting Corruption
and Anti-Corruption Decree. In this regard, they urged the authorities to complete the separation
of commercial and regulatory functions of public enterprises and ministries, improve the
functioning of the courts, reduce red tape, and expeditiously tackle monopolistic tendencies in
certain markets.
Directors agreed that the use of the exchange rate as a nominal anchor has served Azerbaijan
well, and the overall mix of financial policies has been appropriate. Looking forward, they
stressed that the planned increases in non-oil deficits in the medium term are likely to intensify
real appreciation pressures. Given limited sterilization capacity, Directors recommended
accommodating these pressures through nominal exchange rate appreciation, which will be key
to achieving the authorities’ objective of maintaining a low inflation rate.
Directors welcomed the continued remonetization of the economy, which likely reflects
macroeconomic stability and increased confidence in the banking sector. At the same time, they
expressed concern that rapid credit growth associated with this process could overwhelm
banks’ ability to evaluate credit risks. Directors therefore urged the authorities to strengthen
banking supervision to ensure that this rapid credit growth does not adversely affect the quality
of banks’ loan portfolios.
Directors welcomed recent progress in financial sector reforms, including the adoption of the
Banking System Law and the National Bank Law, and the implementation of reform steps to

-5foster competition in the banking sector. However, many Directors expressed concern about
slow progress in privatizing the remaining two state-owned banks and urged the authorities to
press ahead with their privatization plans. Directors also encouraged the authorities to
accelerate other financial sector reforms recommended by the Financial Sector Assessment
Program, including further liberalization of the market for the provision of all banking services to
the government, the strengthening of anti-money laundering legislation, further development of
the government securities market, and improvements of corporate governance and accounting
and auditing standards.
Directors commended the authorities for their recent acceptance of the obligations of Article
VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF Articles of Agreement and their continued commitment to
maintain an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions.
Directors praised the Azeri authorities for the continued improvement in the quality of
macroeconomic statistics, and welcomed their commitment to subscribe to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard in early 2005.
