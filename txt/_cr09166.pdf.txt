•

Discussions: Held in Port Vila, February 18–26, 2009. The mission met the Prime
Minister, the Minister of Finance, Governor of the Central Bank, other ministries and
government agencies, public enterprises, the business community, and donors.

•

Team: N. Thacker (head), M. Iizuka (all APD), and S. Ogawa (OAP). Mr. Ha (OED)

Article IV consultation on February 26, 2007 can be found at
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2007/pn0727.htm. Effectiveness of past
surveillance is mixed. Although the overall fiscal position has improved, the wage bill
has continued to increase and public enterprises remain poorly managed.

•

Exchange rate regime: Vanuatu officially maintains an adjustable peg exchange rate
arrangement, linked to a transactions-weighted basket of currencies. The de facto
classification is “other managed,” as the weights are not disclosed and cannot be
confirmed. Vanuatu has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4,
and the exchange rate system is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for
current international transactions.

•

Outreach: The mission met the business community and donors. It also issued a press
statement.

•

Economic statistics: Vanuatu’s data are sufficient for surveillance purposes, and
significant progress has been made with technical assistance from PFTAC advisors,
but weaknesses remain. Data on national accounts and balance of payments need
further improvement, and data on fiscal operations needs to be more timely. Data on
operations of public enterprises should be collected systematically.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
•

Economic performance has remained strong over the past several years, driven
primarily by tourism, construction activities, and aid inflows. Inflation picked up last
year, reflecting the lagged impact of higher international food and fuel prices and an
acceleration in bank credit to the private sector during the first three quarters. Fiscal
balance improved on better tax compliance and continued strong growth. The current
account deficit widened last year, but was largely financed by donor flows.

•

Vanuatu has so far been largely shielded from the impact of the global
slowdowns, but the slowdown in Australia and New Zealand are likely to have
spillover effects. Vanuatu’s close links with these two countries, mainly through
tourism and foreign direct investment, have contributed significantly to its remarkable
growth performance in recent years. But they have also heightened Vanuatu’s
vulnerability to the projected downturn in these two countries, and there are some
indications that growth is slowing.

•

There has been some progress in structural reforms, but more remains to be
done. Fiscal structural reforms should be further advanced to reorient expenditure and
widen the tax base, while policies to support private sector development are also
needed.

Key Policy Issues
•

Vanuatu is well placed to take counter-cyclical measures should growth slow
more than expected. Given the strong fiscal position, the authorities have room to
use temporary fiscal stimulus measures in addition to expediting pipeline
infrastructure projects. While close monitoring of banks is necessary given the rapid
growth in private sector credit last year, the wide differential in policy rates between
Vanuatu and its major trading partner countries suggests there is some scope for
monetary easing if things deteriorate more than expected.

•

Financial sector supervision could be further improved. In addition to
improvements in the oversight of commercial banks, supervision of the newly
established Vanuatu Agricultural Development Bank (VADB) and the Vanuatu
National Provident Fund (VNPF) should be enhanced.

•

Structural reforms that reduce the cost of doing business are critical to ensure
sustained growth. In particular, improvements in infrastructure, including road
transport, port and wharf facilities, and enhanced flexibility of the labor market are
needed.

4
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
After a period of relative political instability, the political situation has
stabilized. With no party commanding a majority, a coalition government, headed by
Edward Natapai, took office on September 22. After defeating several opposition-led
no-confidence votes, the political situation has stabilized and the government is moving
ahead on policymaking. The 2009 budget was also finally passed in March. With support
from donors, a number of initiatives, including improving transparency of government
operations, are underway.
2.
The 2009 Article IV consultation focused on the spillovers from the global
slowdown in Vanuatu and measures to reduce its adverse impact on the economy. In
particular, while Vanuatu’s close links with Australia and New Zealand (through tourism and
foreign direct investment (FDI)) have been the major sources of growth so far, they have
heightened Vanuatu’s vulnerability to the projected downturn in these two countries. In
addition, growth could be affected further if concerns about the global slowdown were to
drive domestic banks to cut back lending. On the positive side, the decline in food and fuel
prices should help reduce inflationary pressures, providing room to ease monetary policy.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND OUTLOOK
A. Economic Backdrop
3.
Vanuatu has so far been largely
sheltered from the impact of the global
financial turmoil. Coming out of a decade of
stagnant growth, Vanuatu has grown at an
average rate of 6 percent in 2003–08,
outperforming most of the other Pacific Island
countries (PICs), while maintaining a relatively
low inflation rate and an improving fiscal
balance (Box 1).

A booming tourist sector helped to
keep economic activity buoyant. Growth remained strong in 2008 at 6½ percent,
driven primarily by the service sector (which accounts for about two-thirds of GDP)
and aid inflows, including increased disbursements from the Millennium Challenge
Account (MCA). The agricultural sector also pitched in last year on the back of
higher commodity prices.

5
Box 1. Vanuatu’s Recent Success
After several years of low growth, economic growth in Vanuatu has picked up
since 2003. A booming tourism sector combined with FDI, particularly in real estate by
Australians, has helped Vanuatu achieve these high growth rates. Inflation has remained low
compared to other PICs, and the introduction of VAT, combined with improved tax
compliance and strengthened expenditure controls, has resulted in improvements in the fiscal
position. Some factors for Vanuatu’s success are:
•

Progresses in transportation and communication sector: Vanuatu has a natural
advantage over other PICs in terms of proximity to Australia and New Zealand,
encouraging low-cost carriers to offer flights to Vanuatu, including Pacific Blue, which
initiated an international flight operation in 2004. Following this, the government relaxed
restrictions and allowed foreign carriers to compete with the local airlines. Port Vila is
now connected with Australia, New Zealand, and Fiji by several airlines. In addition, the
government ended the monopoly in the telecommunication sector in 2006 by allowing a
second telecommunication license. More recently, Digicel has been allowed to offer
cellular phone services in Vanuatu.

•

Fiscal resource management: Introduction of VAT and commitment to capacity building
in the tax office have contributed to an increase in government revenues. The government
has also improved transparency in fiscal management through more frequent reporting.
The regulatory framework for the state-owned utility company has been strengthened.
Privatization of Air Vanuatu is also under consideration and should help reduce
inefficiencies in the state-owned enterprise sector.

•

Sound monetary and financial policy: With the help of technical assistance from the
Pacific Financial Assistance Center (PFTAC) and other donors, the Reserve Bank of
Vanuatu (RBV) has increased capacity and transparency of monetary operations. The
exchange rate arrangement has helped to contain inflationary pressures. The banking
sector follows international prudential standards. Vanuatu’s AML/CFT framework has
been assessed against the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) 40+9 Recommendations
in 2007 by the Asia-Pacific Group on Money Laundering. Progress has been made in
many areas over the past few years and further improvements are underway.

•

Political stability: While the government changed hands frequently in 1995–2003,
political stability under the former coalition government, which managed to stay in office
for four years, boosted confidence in the economy and enabled the government to pursue
structural and fiscal reforms.

Continued reform efforts are essential for further growth. Notwithstanding the recent
impressive performance, if reform efforts stall and political instability reappears, Vanuatu
could fall back to lower growth rates.

2008

•

The current account deficit widened but was largely financed by aid flows. The
current account deteriorated in 2008 as rising exports, driven primarily by the
recovery in copra and coconut oil exports and tourist revenues, were more than offset
by increased imports of food and fuel, and machinery and transport equipment (the
latter due to infrastructure projects under the MCA). An uptick in aid inflows, mainly
disbursements from the MCA, helped finance the large import bill. On the other hand,
FDI slowed considerably in 2008 as Australia and New Zealand, the largest sources
of FDI, came under increasing strain from the financial crisis. Foreign exchange
reserves remain comfortable at about 5½ months of projected imports of goods.

•

Overall, fiscal performance continued to improve. The overall fiscal surplus
increased to 2.2 percent of GDP in 2008, following a small surplus in 2007. Improved
VAT and trade taxes, reflecting an improvement in tax compliance, more than offset
the additional (election-related) spending on goods and services. Development
expenditure also picked up as the long-awaited donor financing from the MCA began
to feed into capital projects.2

•

Credit growth accelerated in 2008. Bank lending increased significantly last year,
in part reflecting the entry of a fourth foreign-owned commercial bank. Most bank
loans went to the construction and consumer finance sectors. However, tighter
liquidity conditions in the domestic money market combined with stricter lending
standards have resulted in a slow down in credit growth since the fourth quarter of
2008.

1
2

Staff estimates suggest transmission lag is about a quarter between international prices and domestic prices.

Of the total $66 million that Vanuatu is to receive from the MCA account, about $29 million has been
disbursed, with the remaining $37 million to be disbursed by March 2011, the bulk of which is expected in
2009.

7
•

There has been some progress on structural reforms. A new Utilities Act aimed at
strengthening the regulatory framework was passed in 2007. The Personal Property
Securities Act, which broadens the range of assets that can be used as collateral and
strengthens the rights of secured creditors, was passed in 2008. In addition, the
telecommunications sector has been opened up to foreign competition.
B. Outlook and Risks

4.
The global slowdown is likely to affect Vanuatu more than some of the other
PICs, given its heavy dependence on tourism.
•

Growth is projected to moderate to 3 percent in 2009. Indications (based on
banking sector data) are that real estate activity, which has attracted capital inflows
from Australia and New Zealand, has begun to slow. While tourist arrivals remain
strong (airlines and hotel operators suggested confirmed bookings through May
remain strong; frequency of cruise ships has also increased this year so far), spending
by tourists has declined (Box 2). However, MCA disbursements, which picked up last
year after several delays, are expected to remain strong and combined with other aid
inflows should help alleviate some of the negative impact on growth. In addition, the
recent easing in monetary policy and a more accommodative fiscal stance for the
2009 budget would help cushion the impact on growth. Inflation will likely fall,
reflecting lower international food and fuel prices. The current account deficit is
expected to narrow and foreign exchange reserves to improve, reflecting lower
imports due to the decline in commodity prices.

•

Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. Should the global slowdown be
more protracted than expected, including in Australia and New Zealand, this would
further exacerbate the negative impact on tourism and FDI. Furthermore, with three
of the four commercial banks being subsidiaries of foreign banks, banks could come
under increasing pressure from their parent companies to tighten lending standards
and add to the slowdown in growth.

5.
The authorities agreed that growth will moderate in 2009, but only modestly.
The authorities project growth in 2009 at 4½ percent, somewhat higher than staff’s
projections. While there was no fundamental difference in views, the authorities believe that
the impact from the global slowdown is likely to be smaller given the dominance of
subsistence farming and continued strong tourist arrivals based on Vanuatu’s geographic
advantage. Also, Australians concerned about future income are likely to curb their travel
budgets and instead of far away vacations may come to Vanuatu. That said, the authorities
concurred with the staff’s views that overall the risks to the economic outlook are tilted to the
downside given developments in the global economy.

sectors (wholesale and retail trade, hotels
and restaurants, and transport and communication) play an increasingly important role in
the domestic economy. These three sectors account for over two-thirds of GDP, and about
70 percent of the increase in real GDP in the three most recent years.
While tourist arrivals have held up well so far, there are some risks going forward.
Visitor arrivals by air continued to show strong growth in the first two months of this year ,
boosted by the addition of a direct flight from Melbourne in January. The frequency of
cruise ships also increased in the first two months. However, slowing growth in Australia
and New Zealand could have an adverse impact as three-fourths of tourists come from
these two countries. During the IT crisis, downturns in these countries, together with
cyclone-related disasters pushed down travel receipt by 18 percent in 2001. There is also
anecdotal evidence that tourist spending per day is declining. On the positive side, lower
fuel prices may provide some relief through reduced flight costs.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Against this backdrop, policy discussions focused on how Vanuatu could mitigate the effects
of the global slowdown, especially if tourism were to nosedive. In this context, staff
recommended that while fiscal policy should be primarily used to counter the effects of a
downturn, the relatively high policy rate in Vanuatu provides scope to use monetary policy
(though constrained by the exchange rate system) by lowering the policy rate to those
prevailing in trading partner countries, notably Australia and New Zealand. However, it will
be critical to ensure that any policy easing is supportive of growth without creating
inflationary pressures. In addition, the mission stressed that continued structural reforms
remain critical to place the economy on a higher trajectory of long-term sustainable growth.

expenditure remains skewed toward
nonproductive spending, with all revenue collections going toward meeting recurrent
expenditure. The wage bill continued to constitute about half of recurrent
expenditure, and allocations for emergency spending were, in part, used to finance
election-related spending.

•

The 2009 budget is expected to be broadly balanced. In light of the projected
slowdown in economic activity, the mission’s revenue projections are somewhat
lower than in the authorities’ budget (which envisages fiscal surplus of about
1 percent of GDP). Keeping recurrent expenditure similar to the authorities’
projections, staff projects the fiscal balance to be broadly balanced.

computerize fiscal operations across the

ratio remains low, gradually declining over the medium term and debt burden indicators
remain below the indicative thresholds (see Appendix I on debt analysis).

Several structural problems continue to hinder effective fiscal management.

•

Large public wage bill. Vanuatu’s
wage bill (in percent of total
expenditure) is the highest among
PICs, while the share of public
employment in total employment is
broadly the same as in other PICs.
Furthermore, this ratio has increased
from 10½ percent of GDP in 2005 to
an estimated 12 percent of GDP in
2008.

Inefficient public enterprises. In total, there are 24 public enterprises in Vanuatu,
the majority of which continue to receive financial assistance from time to time.
While some of them (e.g., Air Vanuatu) have played a critical role in supporting
Vanuatu’s key industry, tourism, privatization (under consideration for Air Vanuatu)
and/or better management could help to reduce the burden on the budget.

•

Narrow tax base. Vanuatu has a relatively low tax revenue/GDP ratio among PICs.
This reflects the existence of large tax exemptions (especially on interisland shipping
and tourism), estimated at average of 3½ percent of GDP.

Staff views
9.
The mission welcomed the recent fiscal performance and the more
accommodative fiscal stance under the 2009 budget. The authorities are on firmer ground
to use counter-cyclical fiscal policy given the fiscal consolidation achieved so far. The
overall accommodative fiscal stance in the 2009 budget (although there are no explicit
stimulative measures) appears appropriate, especially given some signs of a forthcoming
slowdown. The fiscal balance is expected to remain in surplus over the medium term as
economic activity and tax revenues recover. That said, the authorities should avoid an
expansion in areas where retrenching spending is difficult (e.g., a general increase in the
public wage bill) so as not to jeopardize medium-term fiscal sustainability.
10.
In the event of a sharper-than-expected downturn, a fiscal stimulus could be
provided through better prioritization of fiscal spending and additional donor support.
Measures could be designed to counter the effect of the global slowdown on Vanuatu,
including the following:
•

Allowing the automatic stabilizers to work. While the scope for automatic stabilizers
is limited by Vanuatu’s dependence on VAT, the budget could accommodate a
decline in other taxes, notably customs and property taxes.

11
•

Expanding the social safety net (with assistance from donors), including conditional
cash transfers targeted to those who lose their jobs as businesses cut back spending.
The 2006 Household Income and Expenditure Survey suggests that urban areas are
more susceptible to the global slowdown with more than 30 percent of the urban
population being wage earners, while the majority of the rural population appears to
be engaged in subsistence agriculture.

•

Expediting implementation of pending projects in road construction, including in the
outer islands.

•

Bringing forward new projects (principally financed by additional donor funding).

11.
From a longer-term perspective, the mission emphasized that the authorities
should focus on fiscal “structural” reforms as below:
•

•

Reorienting expenditure. More than half of the recurrent budget is spent on the
wage bill, crowding out expenditure in areas that could help improve the productive
capacity of the economy. Most development expenditure is currently financed by aid
inflows. While aid inflows are expected to remain strong over the next few years, the
government could increase development spending in priority areas through
restructuring expenditures. These measures include:
o

streamlining the wage bill by eliminating vacant positions, and avoiding ad-hoc
increases in wages;

o

enhancing monitoring and accountability of public enterprises to improve
efficiency, and restructuring those that continue to make losses and require
government subsidies; and

o

improving the budget framework to establish transparency and accountability,
including through the passage and implementation of the Public Expenditure
Financial Management (PEFM) Act.

Widening the tax base. The staff stressed streamlining the large tax exemptions,
especially in the tourism sector and rationalizing exemptions in interisland shipping.
In addition, tax administration could be further rationalized by better integrating the
VAT and customs duty collection.

12.
External debt should be maintained at a low level, especially given donors
willingness to provide aid. The mission underscored that the authorities should improve
their capacity to implement aid-related programs and work more closely with donors to align
donor assistance with their own development objectives. This would allow more effective
use of donor assistance while eliminating the need to borrow.

12
The authorities’ views
13.

The authorities agreed with the thrust of staff’s assessments.

•

2009 budget. The authorities agreed that the revenue target may be challenging to
achieve, but they believed that this could be achieved through enhanced efficiency of
the tax system, including the introduction of a Large Tax Payer Unit this year.

•

Policy response to a larger-than-expected slowdown. The authorities welcomed the
mission’s focus on this issue and indicated initiation of contingent plans, including
possibly asking donors to expedite their projects and taking steps to streamline
bureaucracy within the government to expedite projects in the pipeline.

•

Structural issues. While the authorities stressed that Vanuatu’s dispersed landscape
requires a larger civil service especially in education, they agreed that there is scope
to streamline expenditures. In this respect, the authorities have started to reduce
vacant positions in the public sector. They strongly agreed on the need to monitor
public enterprises and recognized that more transparent fiscal management is
necessary. With this in mind, the PEFM bill, which will enhance budget monitoring
and transparency, has been submitted to parliament.

•

External debt. The authorities stressed that the newly contracted loan was a one-off
event and would help provide cheap financing for improving the efficiency and
transparency of budget spending. They have no further plans to borrow and remain
strongly committed to reducing their debt levels.

the monetary stance was eased in
December—the discount rate was lowered by 25 bps to 6 percent, and the Liquid Asset
Requirement (LAR) and the Statutory Reserve Deposit (SRD) requirement were reduced
respectively to 7 percent and 5 percent (from 8 percent and 10 percent)—following a

13
liquidity shortage in the banking sector, caused in large part because lending had accelerated
while deposit growth remained modest.
Staff views
15.
With lending and inflation decelerating recently, and assuming credit growth
continues to moderate, there is some scope to ease the monetary stance if the global
slowdown has a significant adverse impact on the economy.

undertaken, should ensure that RBV’s goal of achieving low inflation and ensuring a
sound banking system are not jeopardized.

While inflation is starting to come down, it is still too early to assess the impact of
last year’s credit expansion (very strong until the third quarter and slowing thereafter)
on bank balance sheets. In particular, with most loans concentrated in the construction
and consumer finance sectors, a slowdown in growth could have potentially
significant negative consequences for bank balance sheets. Staff underscored the need
to monitor bank balance sheets closely and ensure that they were complying with all
prudential regulations.

The authorities’ views
16.
The authorities concurred with the mission’s assessment and agreed that their
policy stance going forward should be guided by developments on both the domestic
front as well as spillovers from the global slowdown. The authorities agreed with the need
to closely monitor bank balance sheets for signs of portfolio deterioration. If inflation fails to
decline to the 3–4 percent range and the economy proves resilient to the global downturn,
they may tighten the SRD/LAR requirements. On the other hand, if growth slows
substantially a more accommodative stance may be warranted. In this context, apart from
standing ready to provide liquidity in the case of emergency, they are also exploring other
financial assets, besides the RBV notes, that can be used as collateral for liquidity provision.

Exchange Rate and Competitiveness
Background
17.
Staff analysis suggests that Vanuatu’s REER is broadly in line with economic
fundamentals. With the fluctuations in major currencies broadly offsetting each other, the
vatu has been largely stable in real effective terms since early 2000s (Box 3). Although the
trade deficit has risen recently, exports of both goods and services were strong and helped to
finance the large import bill due to higher international prices of food and fuel. Foreign
exchange reserves remain strong.
Staff views
18.
The current exchange rate policy remains appropriate. Given the small size of the
economy and limited administrative capacity to conduct monetary policy, the relative
stability of the nominal effective exchange rate has provided an important anchor for
inflation expectations. Structural bottlenecks and international commodity prices, rather than
external price competitiveness, better explain the modest widening in the current account
deficit last year. That said, the current account deficit, mainly reflecting FDI and donorfinanced imports, is expected to remain large over the medium term.
Authorities’ views
19.
The authorities continue to believe that their current basket regime remains
appropriate. They shared the mission’s views that eliminating structural bottlenecks holds
the key to increasing competitiveness.
Financial Sector
Background
20.
Despite rapid credit growth, the
banking system remains sound. Banks are
well capitalized with the capital adequacy
ratio above 30 percent while nonperforming
loans (NPLs) have been declining rapidly.
(partly reflecting the recent rapid growth in
total loans). Profitability remains high
although the tight financing conditions toward
the end of the year led to a decline in lending
margins.

Box 3. An Exchange Rate Assessment for Vanuatu
•

•

•

Vanuatu’s currency has been
stable in nominal effective terms.
While the bilateral nominal
exchange rate against the U.S. dollar
and the Australian dollar was
volatile, the impact has been largely
offsetting. This has helped to keep
the NEER stable, despite rapid
currency movements during the
recent period of financial market
volatility.
The real effective value of the vatu
has remained broadly in line with
economic fundamentals. With
inflation in Vanuatu under control,
and moving broadly in line with
those of major trading partners, the
vatu has also been stable in real
effective terms. A quantitative
exchange rate assessment based on
the fiscal position and the terms of
trade confirms that the vatu remains
in line with economic fundamentals.1

The VADB was established last year, with an initial capital of vatu 200 million
from the budget (total capitalization to reach vatu 500 million by 2011) with the aim of
providing loans to farmers. The VNPF has also started to engage in providing loans to its
members with their savings in the provident fund as the collateral.
Staff views
21.
Financial sector supervision should be enhanced given the recent rapid growth
of credit and the global financial environment. In this context, the authorities should be
vigilant of the additional risks commercial banks face from a possible slowdown, especially
given their exposure to personal and construction-related loans. Both the VADB and VNPF
should be brought under RBV supervision. While financial sector supervisory standards are
in line with international practice and financial sector supervision has been strengthened
significantly, lack of sufficiently trained staff still constrains the effectiveness of monitoring.
In addition, the recent decision to move insurance supervision from the Financial Service
Commission to RBV should be carefully planned and enough resources should be devoted to
ensure adequate supervision. The mission also underscored the importance of making the
Financial Intelligence Unit fully operational so that it can enforce AML/CFT provisions.
The authorities’ views
22.
The authorities agreed with the importance of enhanced supervision given the
current environment. In particular, they underscored that they have been closely watching
the recent increase in personal-consumption loans and have alerted banks. The authorities are
planning to bring VADB under central bank supervision to ensure sound management. On
AML/CFT, the authorities reiterated their commitment to fully implement the regulations and
indicated that they were seeking additional technical assistance for training staff.
B. Policies to Support Sustainable Growth
Background
23.
There have been some improvements in the business climate, but much remains
to be done. Recent steps taken by the government are encouraging (as described in the
background section), but several challenges remain:
•

Infrastructure bottlenecks. Poor infrastructure, including lack of a good road
network, lack of interisland shipping, lack of storage facilities at wharfs, congestion
at ports, all raise the cost of doing business.

•

Labor market cost. A new Employment Act (passed by parliament, but not yet
implemented), would raise the severance pay scale fourfold. This could raise labor

17
costs significantly and has raised widespread concerns across the business
community. 3
Staff views
24.
Staff underscored the importance of continued structural reforms to help reduce
business costs. Improving infrastructure to lower trade-related costs at ports would help
Vanuatu raise its growth potential. At the same time, striking a better balance between
workers rights and employer constraints with regard to the Employment Act will help to
improve worker pay and safeguard employment while ensuring that Vanuatu remains
attractive for businesses.
Authorities’ views
25.
The authorities pointed to a number of steps being taken to address structural
bottlenecks:
•

Discussions are underway with a donor to upgrade the wharf facilities. The Efate
Ring Road (financed by MCA) is underway and due to be completed by early 2011.
They are also seeking donor assistance to extend roads further and develop interisland
shipping.

•

Plans for privatizing Air Vanuatu are underway and the government is trying to
identify other enterprises that could be privatized.

•

The Employment Act is being reviewed and the government plans to consult all
stakeholders in order to reach a consensus before implementing the act.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL

26.
Vanuatu has recently shown remarkable growth, but is not immune to the
current global slowdown. Driven by strong growth in tourism and construction sectors, real
GDP has been growing at an average of 6 percent in the last five years. Although the impact
from the global slowdown is yet to be felt, construction-related FDI and spending by tourists
appear to show some signs of a slow down. At this conjuncture, growth in 2009 is expected
to be at 3 percent, with risks tilted to the downside.
27.
Vanuatu is well positioned to respond with counter-cyclical fiscal measures,
should growth slow more than expected. The 2009 budget aims for a more modest surplus
than last year and in this sense is more accommodative. However, given the strong fiscal
position and low public debt, the authorities have room to use temporary fiscal stimulus

3

It raises severance pay from the current two weeks to eight weeks for every year of work.

18
measures (e.g., targeted conditional cash transfers) to cushion the impact on the economy. In
addition, expediting pipeline infrastructure projects will also help.
28.
A cautious easing of the monetary stance may be warranted if the slow down
turns out to be more serious than anticipated. Domestic price pressures have been coming
down, although with a lag compared to most other regions. Provided inflation continues to
decline and bank balance sheets remain strong, the monetary stance could be further relaxed
to support growth.
Further improvements in bank supervision are advisable. In particular, closer
monitoring of bank balance sheets, including RBV supervision of VADB, will help early
detection of any signs of deterioration in loan quality and help the authorities to take timely
action to ensure a continued sound banking system.
29.

30.
The current exchange rate regime remains appropriate. The exchange rate
appears to be broadly in line with economic fundamentals. With a sound reserve position
supported by tourism and capital inflows, there appears to be little sign of exchange rate
misalignment.
31.
Further structural reforms are necessary to sustain a high growth path. The
significant progress to date has already yielded tangible results. Looking forward, the priority
areas are improving road and port infrastructure, improving management and efficiency at
public enterprises, and ensuring a flexible labor market.
32.
Improving capacity to compile statistics is necessary. The authorities identified
several areas for technical assistance, especially to improve national accounts and balance of
payments data. Fund staff, including through PFTAC, will continue to provide assistance in
these areas.
33.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Vanuatu takes
place on a 24-month cycle.

APPENDIX I. VANUATU: PUBLIC AND EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY1,2
This appendix summarizes the debt sustainability analysis (DSA) for Vanuatu using the
framework for low-income countries. Vanuatu’s public debt has been declining on average,
reflecting strong growth performance, successful fiscal consolidation, and large aid inflows
which eschewed the need for borrowing. As a result, most debt burden indicators under the
baseline scenario are below their indicative thresholds. This analysis suggests that Vanuatu’s
public debt dynamics are sustainable and the country faces a low level of debt distress.
I. INTRODUCTION AND BASELINE
Reflecting strong growth and fiscal surpluses over the last few years, Vanuatu’s total
public sector debt stock is estimated to have declined to 18½ percent of GDP in
2008 from 28 percent of GDP in 2005. The ratio of external debt to GDP fell from over
30 percent in 2000 to 13¾ percent in 2007, inching up a little to 15¾ percent in 2008, due to
a new bilateral loan. This DSA presents the projected path of Vanuatu’s external and public
sector debt burden indicators, and draws some conclusions on the forward-looking
sustainability of debt.
Vanuatu’s DSA builds on the baseline scenario assumptions presented in Box I.1. It
assumes real GDP growth rate of about 4½ percent on average over the medium term,
inflation of about 3 percent, and modest fiscal surplus. The baseline assumes no additional
external borrowing other than the new bilateral loan contracted in 2008.3 The authorities are
strongly committed to fiscal consolidation and do not anticipate the need to borrow given
donor flows.
II. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
External debt stood at 15¾ percent of GDP in FY2008, down from over 20 percent in
FY2005 (Table I.1a, Figure I.1). The government took on a new loan in 2008 to expedite
improvements in IT-related infrastructure. Under the baseline scenario, the NPV of external
debt is projected at 10½ percent of GDP in 2008 (below the indicative threshold based on the
CPIA rating which assumes Vanuatu to be a weak reformer).4 This ratio is expected to fall to
1

In light of the low debt-to-GDP ratios, this DSA was prepared by Fund staff only.

2

Data on state enterprise and provincial government debt are not available. Therefore, the public debt
sustainability analysis is limited to central government debt data.

3

It is a bilateral loan of about US$27 million at 2 percent interest, with a 5-year grace period and 20-year
maturity.

4

The average World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment for the period 2005–07 classifies
Vanuatu as a poor performer. The corresponding debt distress thresholds are NPV of debt-to-exports
(100 percent), GDP (30 percent), and revenues (200 percent), and debt service in percent of exports (15 percent)
and revenues (25 percent).

31
9¼ percent by FY2013 and further in the medium term. The NPV of debt-to-exports and
revenue ratios increase somewhat in 2009–10, but declining thereafter. All the ratios
(including PPG debt service in percent of exports and revenue) remain well below their
respective indicative thresholds as shown.
The alternative scenarios and bound tests indicate that external debt sustainability is
sensitive to an exchange rate shock (Table I.1b, Figure I.1). If growth is assumed to be at
its historical average, the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio falls, reflecting the strong performance
of the last five years. Among the various stress tests, bound test 6 (30 percent nominal
depreciation of the exchange rate) results in the largest increase in the NPV of debt-to-GDP
ratio, which jumps to 18 percent in 2009–10, then declines gradually. None of the stress tests
cause any breaches in the thresholds.
III. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
Vanuatu’s public debt has declined from over 40 percent of GDP in 2002 to
18½ percent of GDP in 2008, reflecting the authorities’ commitment to fiscal
consolidation (Table I.2a). The NPV of debt-to-GDP is expected to decline from
14½ percent at end-2008, to 10¾ percent in 2013, and further to around 1 percent by
end-2028.
Public debt is sensitive to exchange rate changes, given the dominance of external debt
in total public debt. Compared to 2008, a one-time 30 percent real depreciation of the
exchange rate would raise the NPV of public debt-to-GDP by 6 percent age points in 2009,
mirroring the impact on external debt, and fall gradually thereafter. A sizable growth shock
in 2009–10 (economy is assumed to contract by 11½ percent in two years compared to the
baseline) will likely have a lasting effect over the medium term. The baseline scenario is
more favorable than the historical one, reflecting the success of government’s fiscal
consolidation efforts and commitment to continue this in the future. The other factors have a
modest impact on the NPV of debt-to-GDP.
IV. STAFF ASSESSMENT
Assuming Vanuatu continues to make steady progress in reducing its public debt burden,
as it has done in the past few years, public debt sustainability should be manageable.
While several indicators show that the economy’s debt is low, debt remains somewhat
vulnerable to a major shock in the exchange rate. Also, changes in GDP growth in particular
affect the debt dynamics. Given that both growth and balance of payments are driven by
tourism, the external environment, especially the current global environment does pose a
challenge. Therefore, the authorities must remain committed to bringing down the external
debt further to reduce vulnerabilities. Going forward, improved coordination with donors to
align their plans with authorities’ development objectives can help to mobilize/use aid inflows
more effectively.

32
Box I.1. Assumptions for the Medium-Term Baseline Scenario
Real GDP growth is projected to average 4½ percent over the medium term as
further structural reforms, including improvements in infrastructure, boost
productivity. After moderating in 2009–10, tourism is expected to grow at a
somewhat more moderate pace than in the last few years.
Inflation is projected at around 3 percent over the projection period. With a
transaction-based exchange regime providing an effective inflation anchor, inflation
has been on average 2½ percent in the recent five years.
The overall fiscal balance is projected to register an average surplus of ¼ percent of
GDP over the medium term given the recent strong fiscal performances supported by
authorities’ commitment to a sound fiscal policy. This envisages a modest fiscal
expansion (in the current expenditure) in the near term, but assumes that the
authorities limit expenditures as a share of GDP after 2012.
The current account deficit is expected to decline in 2009−10 as import prices are
expected to fall (around 5 percent of GDP) while economic activity will slow with
some lags from the global economy, but is expected to widen to about 6½ percent by
2014, due mainly to a substantial pick up in tourism-related imports financed by FDI
inflows. The real effective exchange rate is assumed constant.
Aid inflows are assumed to remain stable. FDI related to tourism and real estate is
expected to increase significantly. With these developments, reserve cover is
projected to remain around six months of projected imports by 2014.

1/ Due to data constraints, it includes only public external debt.
2/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
3/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
4/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange
rate changes.
5/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
6/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and nondebt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

SDR Department:

Since 1988, Vanuatu has officially maintained an adjustable peg exchange
rate arrangement. Currently, the exchange rate of the vatu is linked to a
transactions-weighted (trade and tourism receipts) basket of currencies. The weights
and composition of the basket, which are not publicly disclosed, are adjusted
periodically. The Reserve Bank of Vanuatu (RBV) quotes daily buying and selling
rates for the vatu against the U.S., Australian, and New Zealand dollars; the euro; the
U.K. pound; and the Japanese yen. The rate in terms of the U.S. dollar as of February
27, 2009 was VT 119.10 per U.S. dollar. The de facto classification is “other
managed,” as the composite weights and not disclosed and cannot be confirmed.
Vanuatu has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and
maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on payments and transfers
for current international transactions.
VIII. Article IV Consultation:
The last Article IV consultation discussions with the authorities were held in Port

ANNEX II. VANUATU—RELATIONS WITH THE
PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTER (PFTAC)1
Since 1998, the Center’s assistance to Vanuatu has included 31 advisory missions, with a
primary focus in banking supervision and statistics. In addition, Vanuatu has sent 36 officials
to the Center’s regional seminars, workshops, and training courses.
Financial Sector Supervision
PFTAC has provided assistance to the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu (RBV) to assist with the
continued strengthening of its supervision of domestic and offshore banks and the provident
fund. A the request of the authorities, the PFTAC Financial Sector Supervision Advisor will
visit the RBV between April 20 and May 1, 2009 to review the adequacy of banking
regulations in relation to current best practices and assess the adequacy of prudential
reporting requirements for conducting off-site monitoring and analysis activities. In addition,
the advisor responds to ad-hoc requests for assistance. PFTAC also organized peripatetic
advisors to assist the Vanuatu Financial Services Commission with the development of a
supervisory framework for domestic and offshore insurance companies. PFTAC has also
assisted the RBV arrange technical assistance to strengthen the functions of the central bank.
Public Financial Management
AusAid has funded an extensive technical assistance program in budget management.
PFTAC has complemented that assistance through advice on prioritization and sequencing of
needed reforms, and, in 2003, by training of staff on moving budget reporting to a GFS basis
(see below). PFTAC has also been providing advice and assistance through a peripatetic
advisor on macroeconomic forecasting and analysis. It has also provided training for line
ministry officials on Public Financial Management and costing of projects.
Tax Administration and Policy
There is a potential loss of revenue arising from regional trade agreements and arrangements
(PICTA and PACER). In response, PFTAC is assisting the authorities to analyze and
consider the possible introduction of an income tax.

1

The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) in Suva, Fiji is a multi-donor technical assistance
institution, financed by the IMF, AsDB, AusAID, NZODA, and, until 2001, by the UNDP, with the IMF as
Executing Agency. The Centre’s aim is to build skills and institutional capacity for effective economic and
financial management that can be sustained at the national level. Member countries are: Cook Islands,
Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa,
Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.

5
Economic Statistics
Following a PFTAC review, technical assistance provided by STA in the context of the
GDDS/PFTAC project for Pacific Island countries resulted in Vanuatu producing quarterly
balance of payments and international investment position statistics consistent with the
BPM5. The Centre trained staff and developed plans for presenting government finance
statistics on the basis of the 2001GFS Manual and for integration of GFS classifications with
the budget and accounting systems. Data based on the new standards is nearing completion.
PFTAC also undertook a mid-term review of the statistics element of an AusAID/ADB
funded institutional strengthening project. PFTAC has provided peer review of national
accounts compilation in June 2005 and June 2006. A PFTAC mission was undertaken in
December 2008 to review source data to produce GDP by expenditure approach. The mission
developed a suitable methodology to produce current and constant 2006 price estimates.

6
ANNEX III. VANUATU: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of March 2009)
Vanuatu joined the World Bank Group in 1981. In that period, five IDA credits, totaling
$18.9 million have been committed, the most recent in 2001. World Bank investments in
Vanuatu have covered agricultural extension and training (1983), transportation and
education infrastructure (1986), primary and secondary education (1988), affordable housing
(1991), and an investment to support education in vernacular languages (2001), which never
became effective. All of these are now closed. The Bank has also been the executing agency
for a Global Environment Facility adaptation project, and the Bank Group (including both
IDA and IFC advisory services) has provided grants for technical assistance to support the
Government of Vanuatu’s reform efforts.
The Bank Group anticipates significantly scaling up support for Vanuatu over the next
few years. Vanuatu is eligible for approximately $11 million in IDA credits under the
IDA-15 replenishment period (FY09 to FY11), and this financing has considerable potential
to underpin enhanced levels of policy engagement. IFC has also had extensive engagement in
providing advisory services to Vanuatu, and engagement may scale up considerably if the
government continues with airline privatization (discussed below). World Bank Group
assistance to Vanuatu supports the government’s own development priorities, and is guided
by the Bank’s Pacific Regional Strategy FY06–FY09, which is shortly to be updated.
The Bank Group’s current and planned engagement with Vanuatu is focused on encouraging
the access of Vanuatu citizens to regional labor markets, promoting private sector-led
growth, and strengthening Vanuatu’s disaster preparedness and climate change adaptation
efforts.
Enhancing Access to Regional Labor Markets
The Bank’s report At Home and Away, published in 2006, outlined global evidence that
seasonal labor schemes allowing Pacific island citizens temporary access to major economies
had scope to both improve the overall welfare of participating Pacific island countries, as
well as benefit receiving economies by providing workers for industries experiencing labor
shortages.
The New Zealand and Australian governments have announced new Pacific seasonal labor
schemes. Vanuatu was selected to participate as one of the countries to be included in the
initial round of these schemes—the only country in Melanesia to be included to date.
The Bank was requested by the Vanuatu as well as the Australian and New Zealand
governments to play a facilitating role in the design and evaluation of this scheme that will
involve ni-Vanuatu working in selected horticultural farms in Australia and New Zealand.
In combination, the Bank is helping to strengthen the capacity of institutions to regulate,
manage, and facilitate these schemes. The Bank Group has also been engaged in efforts to

7
reduce very high transaction costs associated with the transfer of remittances to the Pacific
islands, in order to maximize the benefits to the islands from such schemes.
Promoting Private Sector Growth
Investment Climate. IFC’s advisory services have assisted the Vanuatu Investment
Promotion Authority in developing and implementing an overall strategy to improve the
business enabling environment and encourage investment. The Bank and IFC have jointly
financed a long-term program of technical assistance, which includes international and local
personnel based in Port Vila for an extended period, and the FIRST trust fund is supporting
efforts to strengthen regulation and supervision of company and trust service providers.
Utilities. The Bank Group is supporting government efforts to reduce high utility costs
through a series of reports and technical assistance. Following a performance and regulatory
review of the utilities sector during FY04, the Bank has assisted in the government’s
National Energy Policy Framework and National Rural Electrification Master Plan. A key
focus over the next few years will be Bank support for government’s initiatives to reform the
telecommunications sector and improve the coverage and quality of services. The entry of
new private mobile telephone operators in Vanuatu holds significant potential. The Bank
anticipates scaling up efforts throughout the Pacific region, including Vanuatu, to strengthen
regulatory capacity to both encourage private sector investment and ensure maximum
benefits for countries from the rapid expansion of telecoms services.
Airline Privatization. At the request of the Government, IFC advisory services have
completed a study on the potential privatization of Air Vanuatu. With lower fuel prices now
reducing pressures on the airline industry, the Government has asked IFC to reactivate
support.
Disaster Preparedness and Climate Change Adaptation
The Bank has been the implementing agency for a GEF financed Vanuatu National
Adaptation project. Vanuatu has been included in Pacific regional support provided by the
Bank, through the Global Fund for Disaster Recovery and Rehabilitation (GFDRR), and has
been selected as a priority country for GFDRR Track 2 support, to strengthen the
government’s disaster preparedness and mitigation efforts.
Supporting Communities
In collaboration with the governments of Vanuatu and Australia, the Bank is currently
exploring options to strengthen the delivery of rural services. Through the Justice for the
Poor program, grant financing has also been provided to ensure that varying community
views can be better incorporated into future program design.

8
World Bank Group Presence in Vanuatu
The Government of Vanuatu has requested that the Bank Group consider establishing a
liaison office in Port Vila, as is being done jointly with the Asian Development Bank in
Tonga and Samoa. Given the potential for expanding Bank Group engagement, the Bank is
considering options sympathetically in the context of broader FY10 budget planning
processes.

9
ANNEX IV: VANUATU—RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK1
(As of end-December 2008)
The Asian Development Bank’s (AsDB) operations in Vanuatu started in 1981. Since joining
AsDB, Vanuatu has received nine loans totaling $51.25 million and technical assistance (TA)
for 55 projects amounting to $16.36 million. More than 50 percent of the loans were for
infrastructure rehabilitation and more than 40 percent of the TA funding was for institutional
support and capacity building. There were no ongoing loan projects in the portfolio in 2008,
but there are three active TA projects amounting to $2.2 million.
The current AsDB Country Program aims at rapid, inclusive and private sector-led economic
growth and directly supports the Government’s development priorities—specifically private
sector development and employment creation, as reflected in the Priorities and Action
Agenda (2006–15). The following are ongoing activities:
•
TA4457-VAN: Secured Transactions (ST) Reform. The development of ST system
for chattels was initiated in November 2005. Promising progress is being made in
establishing the legal and regulatory framework - Secured Transactions' Law was passed
in April 2008 and efforts are underway to develop a secured transactions registry.
•
TA4856-VAN: Vanuatu Financial Services Commission (VFSC) Institutional
and Legal Reforms, initiated in March 2007. The TA is aimed at reforming the laws and
regulations constituting companies, developing a bankruptcy and insolvency framework,
developing a company registry reform road map, and provide an assessment of the VFSC to
ensure high corporate governance standards and strong supervisory capabilities. The reform
bills will be presented to parliament for enactment in 2009 and substantial work is being
undertaken in the areas of institutional reform of VFSC.
•
TA7023-VAN: Expanding Access to Financial Services launched in August 2008,
supports National Bank of Vanuatu (NBV) in introducing a new business model of bank
agents in rural communities beyond the reach of present NBV branches. Equipped with
appropriate technology and communications equipment, these agents will enable much of the
presently un-banked rural population to establish and operate savings accounts and utilize
account transaction facilities conveniently.
Vanuatu hosts the Pacific Aviation Safety Office (PASO), a regional organization established
through an AsDB loan that was approved in 2005. From its base in Port Vila, PASO provides
safety and security oversight and technical assistance to airlines, regulators, and airports in
nine Pacific countries.

1

Prepared on the basis of input provided by AsDB staff.

10
In 2008, AsDB, the World Bank, the Australian Agency for International Development, and
the New Zealand Agency for International Development (NZAID) initiated a process to
improve cooperation in the infrastructure sector in the Pacific Developing Member countries,
including Vanuatu, through establishment of the Pacific Region Infrastructure Facility and
the Pacific Infrastructure Advisory Center. These initiatives will provide specialist advice
and finance for investments in all infrastructure sectors.
Following the Vanuatu government’s Comprehensive Reform Programme Summit in March
2007, NZAID, in cooperation with AsDB, undertook a joint shipping study to evaluate the
current inter-island shipping situation, including the current enabling environment and
related governance, management and policy and regulatory framework issues. This study was
completed in July 2008 with the Council of Ministers endorsing the major recommendations
in late 2008. In upcoming years, AsDB in conjunction with NZAID will seek to implement a
project that could include options for introducing measures supporting improved shipping
services for remote, poorly served outer island communities. In particular, this project may
focus on (i) strengthening of the institutional, policy, legislative and regulatory framework
for inter-island shipping, (ii) upgrading and rehabilitating wharf and other domestic shipping
infrastructure, and (iii) setting up franchise tender scheme to provide services to poorly
served locations.
AsDB has recently started an intensive dialogue with the government on economic and sector
work for the new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) covering 2010–14 to be approved in
2009. AsDB’s future CPS will be broader than the current private sector development focus,
but the latter will continue to be highly relevant and remain a cornerstone of the expanded
strategy. The CPS 2010–14 may focus on the following areas: (i) Inter-Island Shipping
Service Reforms, (ii) Continued support in Private Sector Development, (iii) Urbanization
of Port Vila, (iv) Promoting Energy Efficiency and Access to Renewable Energy, and
(v) Improving the efficiency and effectiveness of infrastructure and service delivery.
Progress in debt reduction in recent years may have increased the government's willingness
to consider returning to borrowing in 2009. The AsDB loan allocation for 2009–10 has been
set at $11.7 million. Any future lending operations will be based on a thorough debt
sustainability analysis, with consideration given to innovative approaches such as loan
buy-down mechanisms and the use of co-financing partnerships to reducing financing costs.
Flexibility will be important, to allow AsDB to respond to reform opportunities and
complement the grant resources of other agencies, especially in transport and infrastructure.

ANNEX V. VANUATU: STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of March 25, 2009
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but are broadly adequate for surveillance. In
particular, data on national accounts, government finance and external sector statistics need to be
further improved.
National Accounts: While there have been improvements in methodology and the development
of additional data sources, expenditure-based GDP estimates are not yet available. Also, data are
compiled only on an annual basis. Constant price GDP estimates still use 1983 as the base year,
although work on rebasing the estimates to 2006 are underway.
Price statistics: The CPI weights are based on 1998 household surveys, and only cover the two
urban centers of Port Vila and Luganville. The CPI basket does not reflect the recent structural
changes in the consumption basket, for example telecommunication prices and related utilities.
Government finance statistics: Budget classification is broadly consistent with the 1986 GFSM.
Government operations data include all central government agencies. However, they exclude
public enterprises and operations of provincial governments and the two municipalities. The
operations of the budget are recorded on a cash plus invoice basis.
Monetary statistics: The Reserve Bank of Vanuatu (RBV) reports monthly monetary data,
including the accounts of the monetary authorities, commercial banks, and interest rates in its
monthly bulletin posted on its website. The RBV also publishes a quarterly report with the
coverage of wider financial data including fiscal transactions and financial soundness indicators
(e.g., amount of non-performing loans and earnings).
External sector statistics: Quarterly and annual balance of payments data are compiled
according to The Balance of Payment Manual, Fifth Edition. Trade data have been compiled
using customs declaration forms collected from the two shipping ports of entries, Port Vila and
Santo. Imported items by air are also captured, but imported goods and services through the post
office have not been captured. Data on capital account also needs further improvements. Errors
and omissions remain quite large.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Participant in the General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS) since April 2004.

No data ROSC is available.

III. Reporting to STA
Annual GFS data through 1999 have been reported for publication in the GFS Yearbook, using
the 1986 GFS format. No sub-annual fiscal data have been reported for publication in IFS since
2001.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 21, 2009

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation
with Vanuatu
On May 11, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Vanuatu.1
Background
Vanuatu’s economic performance has remained strong over the past several years. Backed by
a booming tourist sector, strong performance of the service sector and aid inflows, growth
averaged 6 percent in 2003–08, outperforming most of the other Pacific Island countries (PICs).
Inflation accelerated to 5.8 percent in 2008 from 4.1 percent in 2007, due mainly to higher
international food and fuel prices. However, core inflation remained relatively stable. While the
current account deficit widened in 2008 reflecting higher imports of food, fuel, and aid-related
capital imports, an uptick in aid inflows helped to finance the large import bill. Foreign exchange
reserves remain comfortable at about 5½ months of projected imports of goods.
Fiscal performance improved further. The overall fiscal surplus increased to 2.2 percent of GDP
in 2008 from a slight surplus in 2007, as higher-than-projected spending on goods and services
was more than offset by improved VAT collections and trade taxes. Development expenditure
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
also picked up as the long-awaited donor financing from the Millennium Challenge Account
(MCA) began to feed into capital projects. The public debt-to-GDP ratio is estimated to have
declined to 18½ percent of GDP in 2008 from over 40 percent in 2002.
Credit growth accelerated in 2008, in part reflecting the entry of a fourth foreign-owned
commercial bank in the market. Most bank loans went to the construction and consumer finance
sectors. However, a tightening of liquidity conditions in the domestic money market combined
with stricter lending standards in light of the deteriorating global economic environment, has led
to a slowdown in credit growth in the fourth quarter. That said, banks remain well capitalized
and nonperforming loans remain low.
Progress was also made on structural reforms. Most notably, a new Utilities Act aimed at
strengthening the regulatory framework was passed in 2007. The Personal Property Securities
Act, which broadens the range of assets that can be used as collateral and strengthens the
rights of secured creditors, was passed in 2008. In addition, the telecommunications sector was
further liberalized and opened to foreign competition.
The global slowdown is likely to affect Vanuatu more than some of the other PICs, given its
heavy dependence on tourism. As a result, growth is expected to slow in 2009. However, strong
tourist arrivals expected at least for the first few months combined with higher donor
disbursements are expected to help alleviate some of the negative impact on growth. In
addition, the recent easing in monetary policy and a more accommodative fiscal stance for the
2009 budget would help cushion the impact on growth. Lower international food and fuel prices
will likely contribute to lower inflation and narrow the current account deficit, improving the
overall external balance.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Vanuatu’s robust economic performance in recent years,
underpinned by strong fiscal and monetary policies. They noted that the impact of the global
slowdown on Vanuatu’s economy has so far been limited, and acknowledged that adverse
effects this year are likely to be largely confined to spillovers via the tourism and foreign direct
investment channels.
Directors welcomed the improvement in the fiscal position in recent years. They commended
the authorities for their efforts at maintaining a fiscal surplus for five consecutive years and
reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio significantly. Directors supported staff’s recommendation that, in
the event of a sharper-than-expected slowdown, the authorities could provide additional fiscal
stimulus, including by expediting pending projects and by further strengthening the social safety
net. Directors also emphasized the importance of well coordinated donor support.
Directors underscored that various fiscal structural reforms are needed for a more effective
fiscal policy over the medium term. They noted that prioritization of spending is crucial to
promoting growth while keeping expenditure pressures manageable. In particular, they

3
emphasized the need to monitor the large public sector wage bill and loss-making public
enterprises. In addition, improvements in tax administration and widening the tax base would
help finance development expenditure as foreign aid begins to gradually taper off as the
economy matures.
Directors agreed that the central bank could cautiously ease the monetary stance if the
slowdown is deeper and longer than expected. They saw room for further monetary easing,
given the wide interest-rate differentials with major central banks. Nonetheless, Directors
stressed that the authorities should be mindful of rapid credit expansion, given the inflation
experience of the recent past.
In this context, and building on recent achievements, Directors emphasized that banking
supervision should be strengthened further to help preserve a stable and sustainable progrowth environment. They stressed that supervisors need to be vigilant against a possible
worsening of bank balance sheets, and welcomed the authorities’ plan to expand central bank
supervision to the Vanuatu Agricultural Development Bank. They also saw the need to
implement the regulations related to Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of
Terrorism (AML/CFT) expeditiously.
Directors acknowledged that the current exchange rate regime remains appropriate. They noted
that the exchange rate remains broadly in line with economic fundamentals and that the
prevailing exchange rate regime provides a useful inflation anchor and has helped the currency
to gain credibility.
Directors stressed that further structural reforms should help sustain economic growth in the
future. They acknowledged that past reforms had enabled the recent rapid economic growth,
and that the authorities had a strong track record and a high degree of credibility for tackling the
difficult reforms ahead. Directors particularly emphasized moving ahead with priority reforms
related to improving road and port infrastructure, strengthening management and efficiency at
public enterprises, and ensuring flexible labor markets.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to improve the capacity for statistics. They noted
that improvements in key data would help enhance transparency in the economy and aid
effective decision making on macroeconomic policies.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Christoper Y. Legg, Alternate Executive Director for Vanuatu
and Yuong Ha, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
May 11, 2009
Our ni-Vanuatu authorities would like to express their gratitude to staff for the useful and
constructive policy advice during their recent visit. They value staff’s advice to cope with the
impact of the global economic downturn, and also appreciate their continued attention to the
structural reforms that will be needed to sustain Vanuatu’s strong economic performance
over the medium term. In this regard, our authorities also express their gratitude to the
Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center (PFTAC), and the Fund more generally, for
the technical assistance received over the years.
Economic Overview
Growth in Vanuatu has been strong over a number of years, averaging 6 percent since 2003,
and the economy is estimated to have grown by 6.6 percent in 2008. The key drivers of
growth over this period have been tourism and construction, with close links to Australia and
New Zealand facilitating activity in these sectors, and with increased disbursements from the
Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) contributing to construction growth more recently.
Headline inflation, as in many economies, has been heavily influenced by international food
and fuel prices and rose to 6 percent in 2008, compared with the authorities’ 0-4 percent
target range. However, core inflation has remained relatively contained and second-round
effects are expected to be limited. Higher food and fuel prices also contributed to a widening
in the current account deficit in 2008, but aid inflows have remained strong and provided
sufficient financing to enable foreign reserves to remain at a comfortable level (between
5−6 months imports cover).
The overall fiscal position has continued to improve, with a strong increase in revenues
(largely through greater compliance and reform in tax administration) underpinning a surplus
of 2.3 percent of GDP for 2008. Consistent with the authorities’ fiscal consolidation efforts,
the public debt-to-GDP ratio has fallen to below 20 percent, with staff’s analysis indicating
sustainable debt dynamics and a low risk of debt distress.
The domestic banking system has been unaffected by the financial turmoil, given the limited
integration into global financial markets. Credit growth was strong in 2008, mostly financing
construction sector activity, but there were initial signs of a slowing in credit growth towards
the end of 2008.
Overall, the authorities have overseen a period where economic performance has been
impressive by historical standards, and in comparison with other economies in the Pacific
region (as reflected in Figure 1 of the Staff Report).

GDP Outlook
Our authorities agree that growth will moderate over 2009 and, after recent downward
revisions, now expect growth of around 3½ percent, which is broadly in line with staff’s
estimate of 3 percent. They agree that a slowing in tourism and FDI-financed construction
will dampen growth, but believe that there are a number of factors working in Vanuatu’s
favour, which may limit the extent of any downside in economic activity.
•

Vanuatu is closely linked to the Australian and New Zealand economies––two
countries that are expected to be among the better placed to weather the global
downturn, given their strong policy performance and robust financial systems. The
recession in these two economies is expected to be relatively shallow, with a recovery
in 2010.

•

While tourism is likely to decline in a depressed economic environment, there are
likely to be substitution effects with Australian and New Zealand tourists switching
from long haul (U.S., Europe) to short-haul destinations that would favour the Pacific
region. Vanuatu is well placed to benefit from this effect, given an increase in airline
capacity (such as a new direct route from Melbourne) and a significant trend increase
in cruise liner visits in recent years. Vanuatu may also benefit from a redirection of
tourists, given the authorities’ concerted international marketing strategies and recent
political disruptions and adverse weather conditions in some of Vanuatu’s key
competitor markets. To date, tourist arrivals have held up well.

•

The authorities also believe that there could be a significant amount of domestic
construction activity waiting in the pipeline, as much of this activity was potentially
crowded out during the recent FDI-driven construction cycle.

•

The authorities are also preparing contingency fiscal measures that could be
implemented quickly, with donors’ assistance, in the event of a weaker-than-expected
growth.

Fiscal Policy
The 2009 budget projects a reduction in the fiscal surplus, which provides an appropriate
counter-cyclical stance to cushion the impact of a slowing in growth. The authorities expect a
surplus of 0.9 percent of GDP compared to staff’s estimate for a balanced budget. While the
authorities note that the revenue target for 2009 is ambitious, they believe it is achievable,
given their recent track record and planned enhancements to tax administration, including the
introduction of the Large Tax Payer unit.
The fiscal consolidation that has occurred in recent years leaves the authorities well placed to
cope with the economic slowdown. The authorities are preparing contingency measures,
consistent with staff’s advice to better prioritise spending and expedite infrastructure projects

3
in consultation with donors, in the event of a sharper-than-expected downturn. Should
revenues prove stronger than staff’s estimates, then this would provide greater fiscal space to
adopt additional and well-targeted measures.
The authorities are continuing to make steady progress to enhance the budget framework,
and the Public Expenditure Financial Management Act was passed in the recent session of
Parliament. The authorities are also aware of the need to contain the public wage bill, but
stress that there are limits to what can be achieved given the need to provide essential public
services to a population that is dispersed across over 80 islands and predominantly engaged
in subsistence agriculture.
Monetary Policy
With core inflation remaining relatively stable, the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu (RBV) eased
monetary policy in late 2008. With headline inflation expected to fall back into the RBV’s
0-4 percent target by the end of 2009, there may be scope for further monetary easing.
However, this would require a careful assessment of the impact of last year’s exceptionallystrong credit growth and the adverse impact of the global economic slowdown on the
domestic economy.
The authorities are aware of the need to enhance the monetary policy operational framework.
In particular, they are considering measures to improve the efficiency of the indirect policy
instruments and minimise the recourse to direct/prudential instruments for liquidity
management purposes.
The authorities agree with staff’s exchange rate assessment––maintaining stability in the
nominal exchange rate has proven to be an effective nominal anchor, while addressing
infrastructure bottlenecks remain key to improving the economy’s competitiveness over the
medium term.
Financial Sector
The authorities welcome staff’s finding that the banking system is well-capitalised and
sound. Maintaining banking system stability remains a key priority and the RBV will closely
monitor bank balance sheets for signs of deteriorating asset quality in the wake of the recent
strong increase in credit growth. The authorities are continuing with efforts to improve
supervision, including moving oversight of the insurance sector to the RBV and, as noted in
the Staff Report, there are plans to place the Vanuatu Agricultural Development Bank
(VADB) under the RBV’s supervision with the authorities are well aware of the need to
minimise the potential risk that the VADB poses to the budget.

4
Other
While the authorities have made significant progress in some areas, such as
telecommunications and transport, they agree that further structural reforms will be needed to
improve the economy’s long-term growth prospects. In this regard, they are working closely
with donors to upgrade the wharf facilities, and the MCA-financed Ring Road on Efate
island is currently underway. Increases in construction costs over recent years have meant
that the MCA disbursements will not fully fund all of the projects from the original roundisland road programme, but the authorities are seeking donor assistance to cover the
remaining funding gaps. More generally, the authorities are working closely with donors to
better align aid flows with their key development objectives, particularly in areas of
healthcare and education. In this regard, major donor partners have pledged to maintain or
increase their development assistance for the next few years.
The authorities have prepared plans to privatise Air Vanuatu and are in engaged in finding
suitable investors. They are also aware that management of public enterprises, in general,
needs to be improved, given the drain on budget resources.
In relation to the new Employment Act, the authorities have acknowledged the concerns of
the business community and signaled that there are likely to be significant modifications to
the initial severance pay provisions to ensure an appropriate balance between labour costs
and providing an adequate safety net for workers.
