STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 24, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context. The economy is growing at a moderate pace. Abstracting from the impact of
new large-scale natural gas production, GDP growth is estimated to have moderated to
about 2½ percent in 2013, owing in large part to weak investment and exports. Some
pick up is expected in 2014, but the underlying momentum is weaker than before.
Despite notable progress, Israel’s public debt (68 percent of GDP) remains high, while
continued house price increases pose risks of a boom-bust cycle in the housing market.
Policy priorities. The key policy challenge is to maintain near-term growth at potential,
while preventing the build-up of imbalances, strengthening resilience to shocks, and
ensuring long-term sustainability.
Monetary policy. Given the still uncertain external environment and headwinds to
growth from an appreciation of the shekel and planned fiscal tightening, monetary
policy should remain accommodative for now. Macroprudential policy measures should
be further tightened to minimize the risk of a boom-bust cycle in the housing market. If
growth prospects improve more than expected, the policy stance should be gradually
normalized.
Fiscal policy. Bold fiscal consolidation measures embedded in the 2013–14 Budget are
welcome, but further adjustment will be required for 2015 and beyond to anchor
sustainability, along with a strengthening of fiscal institutions.
Financial stability. The financial system remains relatively sound. In line with the
recommendations of the 2012 FSAP Update, a Financial Stability Committee needs to be
established, with a clear focus on macroprudential policies in normal times. Legal
reforms aimed at strengthening the framework for bank resolution should be legislated
as soon as practicable.
Structural reforms. Further action is required to improve the business climate and
boost competition in the non-tradable sector. In addition, it will be important to
enhance the participation of rapidly growing Israeli-Arab and Ultra-Orthodox Jewish
(Haredi) populations in the labor force to bolster the economy’s long-term potential and
to reduce poverty and inequality.

CONTEXT
The Israeli economy has weathered the global crisis remarkably well
1.
Israel has been exposed to a series of
shocks, including the global crisis and heightened
geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.
Nevertheless, GDP growth has averaged 4 percent
over the past 5 years, compared with 0.7 percent
on average for OECD countries (Figures 1, 2 and
Table 1). The overall living standards continue to
improve gradually, with per capita real GDP
growing more rapidly than in other OECD
countries. The economy’s resilience has been
underpinned by solid economic fundamentals,
including large foreign reserves, a dynamic hightech export sector, and the absence of economywide deleveraging pressures. Over the past year,
stock market indices have gradually risen, while
credit spreads of Israeli sovereign and banks
remain stable (Figure 3).
The economy, however, faces significant
challenges

under pressure, reflecting weakness in the global
economy and a sharp appreciation of the shekel. A rapid increase in house prices, notably in the
context of a cooling economy, poses risks of a boom-bust cycle in the housing market, while
notwithstanding notable progress, public debt remains high. Alongside, there is concern that unless
large employment and productivity gaps, particularly between the general Jewish and the IsraeliArab and Ultra-Orthodox Jewish (Haredi) populations, are addressed, growth potential would slow
significantly in the long-run.
Traction of Fund policy advice
3.
Economic policy has been broadly in line with past Fund advice. Consistent with Fund
recommendations in the 2012 Article IV consultations, the BoI has continued to maintain an
accommodative monetary policy stance to support growth, while tightening macroprudential policy
to contain house price inflation. Progress has been made in following through most of the 2012

FSAP Update recommendations, while steps have also been taken to address long-standing
structural problems, notably pertaining to the low participation of Haredi and Arab-Israeli
populations in the labor force. The main deviations from Fund advice have centered on the fiscal
policy stance and issues pertaining to the financial sector architecture. In particular, the budget
outturn underperformed in 2012, reflecting both revenue shortfalls and expenditure overruns, while
the establishment of a Financial Stability Committee (FSC), a key FSAP recommendation, is yet to
materialize.

Following a strong expansion in 2010–11, real GDP

growth moderated to 3½ percent in 2012 and 2013. As a
result, the positive output gap has dissipated. Excluding the
impact of natural gas, growth was more moderate, at
about 2½ percent in 2013.1

The external position remains strong
(Tables 2-3). Foreign reserves have risen to
$82 billion (192 percent of short-term external
debt), and the surplus on the net international
investment position is high at about 22 percent
of GDP. The US government guarantee program
for Israeli sovereign bonds was extended to
2016 in July 2012, providing additional
assurance ($3.8 billion of the total of $9 billion is
untapped). The shekel has appreciated sharply,
up some 12 percent in real effective terms over
the past 15 months.

Growth momentum is expected to remain moderate
8.
Staff expects growth (excluding the contribution of gas) to increase to 3 percent in 2014,
reflecting some recovery in investment. However, growth momentum is expected to remain
moderate, as planned fiscal tightening and shekel appreciation would weigh on the economy and
offset, in part, the pick-up in demand in Israeli trading partners. In the baseline scenario, the output
gap (excluding the impact of gas production) is expected to widen slightly, unemployment to edge
up to just above 6½ percent, and inflation to remain within the 1–3 percent target range.
9.
Beyond 2014, growth over the medium term is projected at around 3½ percent annually
(excluding the impact of gas production), much lower than the annual average of 4¼ percent over
the past 10 years. This reflects, in part, an anticipated reduction in labor force growth (as baby
boomers are reaching retirement ages).

Q1

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISRAEL

Risks to the outlook are mainly to the downside
10.
Israel is a small open economy, with its exports divided roughly evenly among the US,
Europe, and emerging Asia. Financial links to the rest of the world through the banking channel are
limited, but Israel does receive a significant amount of FDI inflows, notably from the US and Europe.
Indeed, following a dip in 2009, FDI inflows have surged and remain the dominant component of
the capital account. By contrast, portfolio inflows, which rose rapidly in 2010, have since then
declined sharply in magnitude—owing to a narrowing of interest rate differentials and the removal
of tax exemption on capital gains for foreign investors—but remain volatile (Annex I).


Externally, the main downside risks pertain to a protracted period of sluggish growth in Europe
and the United States and growth disappointments in emerging economies (Annex II). Given the
limited financial links to the rest of the world, relatively strong macroeconomic fundamentals,
and the predominance of stable FDI inflows, risks related to volatility in global financial markets,
are less of a concern for Israel. In this context, an exit from unconventional monetary policies in
major advanced economies may actually alleviate appreciation pressures on the shekel and pose
upside risks to growth prospects.2



Domestic risks include a further weakening of the competitiveness of the tradable sector, a
correction in the housing market, with attendant implications for the fiscal position and the
financial sector, and the reemergence of regional geopolitical tensions, which would bear upon
sentiment. Risks to the upside could arise from faster-than-expected recovery in Israel’s major
trading partners and larger than anticipated spillovers from the natural gas sector.

POLICY CHALLENGES
11.
Given the still uncertain external environment, the key policy challenge is to maintain nearterm growth at potential, while preventing the build-up of imbalances, strengthening resilience to
shocks, and vigorously pursuing structural reforms to ensure long-term sustainability.

A. Monetary and Exchange Rate
Policies
With headwinds to growth emanating from an
appreciation of the shekel and fiscal tightening,
monetary policy should be on hold for now, lest the
overall macroeconomic policy stance becomes overly
tight. Macroprudential policy measures should be
further tightened to minimize the risk of a boom-bust
cycle in the housing market.

Israel was relatively resilient to the market turmoil in mid-2013. While non-resident portfolio investment flows in
Israel turned negative, this was more than offset by large FDI inflows, notably in the high-tech sector, leading to
currency appreciation pressures (see Annex 1).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISRAEL

12.
Monetary policy has been accommodative. Since October 2011, the BoI has lowered in
several steps the policy rate to 1 percent. At the same time, the BoI has introduced, since 2009,
various types of macroprudential measures to address the risks emanating from rapid house price
increases. This includes “indirect” measures, such as capital surcharges and additional provisioning,
aimed at reducing banks’ incentives to extend mortgage loans. These measures have contributed to
strengthening the resilience of the financial system, but have not been particularly successful in
containing house price inflation. In response, the BoI has more recently put in place “direct”
measures, such as loan-to-value (LTV) and debt-service-to-income (DTI) limits. While it is too early
to assess the effectiveness of such measures, they appear to have reduced speculative behavior and
the volume of housing transactions. If given sufficient time to play out, these measures are expected
to curtail house price inflation.3
Monetary policy faces a delicate balance in the current context
13.
On the one hand, the absence of inflationary pressures and the uncertain external outlook
would suggest maintaining the current accommodative monetary policy stance. On the other hand,
however, house price increases have been rampant and may suggest the need for policy tightening
(Figure 5).4 There is also a concern that fiscal slippages, which have been a common occurrence in
Israel, could contribute to overly accommodative macroeconomic policies and lead to higher
inflation down the road.
Monetary policy should, on balance, remain on hold in the near-term, but the BoI should
respond nimbly to changes in the economic environment
14.
Given the drag on growth from an appreciation of the shekel and planned fiscal tightening
(see section B), as well as the still uncertain external environment, monetary policy should be on
hold for now. The strong appreciation of the shekel, in particular, has hurt competitiveness, causing
sluggish export growth and a protracted decline in manufacturing production. If house prices
continue to rise, “direct” macroprudential measures should be further tightened (e.g. by making the
limits on LTVs and DTI more stringent). At the same time, consideration should also be given to a
tightening of property taxation, notably by raising temporarily the property purchase tax for nonprimary residences. Most importantly, concerted efforts should be made toward alleviating supplyside constraints, including by expediting the implementation of the Housing Committee’s
recommendations.5
15.
If global growth prospects improve sharply or domestic demand strengthens appreciably,
including because the fiscal stance turns out to be more expansionary than expected, or if
appreciation pressures on the shekel ease, including because of policy tightening in major advanced
economies, the monetary policy stance should be gradually normalized.

3

See Annex III and Selected Issues Chapter 1.

4

Staff analysis suggests that house prices in Israel are about 25 percent above their long-term fundamental value.

5

The committee’s key recommendation include: reforming the planning process to expedite the supply of planned
land and the issuance of building permits, and introducing a compensation scheme to accelerate the evacuation of
land currently used for agricultural purposes.

The exchange rate and the current account appear to be broadly consistent with
macroeconomic fundamentals
16.
The shekel has appreciated sharply over the
past year, despite a narrowing of the interest rate
differential. This can be attributed to promising
prospects of large-scale natural gas production and
strong FDI inflows, including from foreign
purchases of Israeli start-ups in the high-tech
sector. At the same time, depreciation pressures
that would typically arise from capital outflows,
owing to investment abroad by Israeli pension and
insurance companies, have been limited because of
active hedging operations by these firms.

Various model estimates (CGER-type and EBA) suggest no obvious sign of exchange rate
misalignment, but the appreciation of the shekel has adversely affected the tradable sector
(Annex I). The mix of tight fiscal and accommodative monetary policy, combined with structural
reforms to boost productivity, should help reduce appreciation pressures on the exchange rate and
improve competitiveness associated with a stronger shekel. In this context, a new foreign currency
purchase program that the BoI introduced in

B. Fiscal Policy: Strengthening Buffers and Credibility
Bold fiscal consolidation measures embedded in the 2013–14 Budget are welcome, but further
adjustment will be required for 2015 and beyond to anchor sustainability, along with a strengthening
of fiscal institutions.
Israel is back on a fiscal consolidation path
18.
Fiscal consolidation stalled in 2012, with the deficit expanding to 4 percent of GDP, well
above the initial target of 2 percent (Tables 4 and 5). In mid-2012, recognizing the risk of a further
widening of the deficit, the government announced some fiscal consolidation measures (such as

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

ISRAEL

raising the VAT rate from 16 to 17 percent) but could not agree on a budget for 2013. As a result,
elections were brought forward to early 2013.
19.
Following the election, the new government announced an ambitious fiscal consolidation
program. The 2013–14 budget included large discretionary consolidation measures totaling
2¾ percent of GDP, with the aim of reducing the deficit to 3 percent of GDP in 2014, which is both
broadly appropriate and realistic and lays the ground for further consolidation over the mediumterm.6




Revenue measures include: (i) raising the VAT
rate from 17 percent to 18 percent;
(ii) increasing the excise tax on tobacco and
beer; (iii) introducing environmental taxes;
(iv) increasing personal income (a measure that
was subsequently rolled back) and corporate
taxes (including a 2 percent surtax on the
wealthiest); and (v) one-time corporate tax
amnesty for companies subject to tax
exemptions under an investment law (“trapped
profits” collections).
On the expenditure side, measures include:
(i) freezing previously planned public sector
wage hikes; (ii) cutting the defense budget;
(iii) reducing child allowances and education
expenditure (including for religious study); and
(iv) postponing infrastructure projects.

20.
Budget implementation in 2013 has been
better than expected. Revenues have been higher
than forecast due largely to one-off measures and
a rebound in the stock market. Expenditures have
been lower-than-expected due to tight spending
controls. Overall, the deficit outturn for 2013 is
expected to be 3.5 percent of GDP, about
¾ percentage point below the target.

Without these measures, the deficit was projected to further widen to 5¾ percent of GDP in 2014. As currently
projected, the fiscal adjustment would amount to a cumulative of 1¼ percentage points of GDP over 2013–14.
Assuming a multiplier in the range of 0.5–0.8 (based on BoI estimates), the adverse impact on growth would be
around ¾–1 percentage points of GDP.

21.
Risks to the fiscal outlook for 2014 are tilted to the downside. Revenue could be lower than
expected, especially if there is a correction in the housing market or planned measures are not fully
implemented. After the 2013–14 Budget was approved, the projection for interest expense was
lowered due to lower-than-assumed interest rates, and in response the government rolled-back the
planned increase in personal income tax for 2014. The two changes are intended to be deficit
neutral, but will lead to a structural revenue loss. Moreover, spending pressures could arise, a
concern mostly pertaining to defense spending. In this context, strict adherence to the expenditure
ceiling and announced tax revenue measures is imperative to ensure the credibility of the fiscal
framework. Nevertheless, if growth underperforms, automatic stabilizers should be allowed to
operate fully, and the deficit target relaxed.
For 2015 and beyond, additional consolidation efforts will be necessary

although an even more ambitious path of deficit
reduction is warranted to provide a greater buffer against shocks, including a sharp correction in the
housing market.
23.
To achieve the deficit targets, additional adjustment will be needed from 2015 onwards. This
will require both reducing expenditure growth by modifying the expenditure rule and introducing
additional revenue measures. Importantly, given the low levels of non-interest civilian expenditures
in Israel, relying solely on reducing expenditure growth would compromise long-term growth and
sustainability.7


Expenditure on priority items that boost the economy’s productive capacity and reduce the
social gap—such as on education, job training, employment services, and infrastructure—should
be protected. Large unfunded expenditure commitments should be avoided, while annual
budgets should provide sufficient contingent reserves in anticipation of shocks.

7

Most recently, the government has submitted to the Cabinet a revised expenditure rule, aimed at reducing
expenditure growth. Consistent with staff recommendations, it is intended that lower expenditure growth will be
complemented by revenue measures to meet the deficit and debt targets. Also see debt sustainability analysis in
Annex IV.

On the revenue side, additional measures should be less distortionary and aim at: (i) broadening
the tax base, including by eliminating tax exemptions (e.g. for advanced study funds and the
VAT exemptions on fruit and vegetables, on tourist services, and in the resort town of Eilat); (ii)
further increasing indirect taxes (e.g. VAT); and (iii) introducing new taxes that reduce
externalities (such as a congestion or a pollution tax) or inequality (such as raising the property
tax).



And a comprehensive review of budgetary and fiscal institutions is imperative
24.
Given the history of repeated and significant slippages in meeting fiscal deficit targets, a
comprehensive review of current fiscal institutions is needed.


Importantly, the current fiscal rules should be developed to have a more clearly defined debt
objective, a better link between this objective and the deficit and expenditure targets, and to
allow for more flexibility to deal with shocks.8



In addition, the fiscal rules should be embedded within a fully-fleshed out medium-term fiscal
and expenditure framework—including a multi-year overall expenditure ceiling and expenditure
allocations to line ministries—multi-year revenue and fiscal forecasts, and an analysis of the risks
to the fiscal outlook. This would enhance the credibility of the framework and promote fiscal
discipline, transparency, and accountability.



Finally, building on the role currently played by the BoI and following the development of a
medium-term fiscal framework, consideration should be given to establishing an independent
and stand-alone fiscal council, both as a disciplining mechanism and to evaluate the consistency
of overall fiscal policies with the fiscal rules.9

C. Financial Sector Policy: How Best to Safeguard Financial Sector
Stability?
The financial system remains relatively sound. A Financial Stability Committee (FSC) needs to be
established, with the BoI taking the lead role, and a new bank resolution framework should be
legislated as soon as practicable.
The financial system remains relatively resilient
25.

Israel’s banking system is domestically oriented, and its soundness is underpinned by strong

and intrusive supervision (Tables 6-8).

historically low mortgage losses, a limited buy-to-let market, and open-ended personal liability,
all curtail risks of major credit losses.


Banks have gradually increased capital ratios, largely through retained earnings, consistent with
the BoI’s new capital regulation which requires all banks to meet the core Tier 1 capital ratio of
9 percent by 2015. The capital ratios at the two largest banks must reach 10 percent by 2017
(under the Basel III capital definition). Banks’ core Tier 1 capital ratios range between 8½ and
9¾ percent, which is relatively low compared with many large banks in other advanced
economies. However, this reflects the conservative use of risk weights. Moreover, Israeli banks’
leverage ratios (equity to capital ratios) are relatively high.



Banks’ operations are fully deposit-funded, with the loan-to-deposit ratio well below
100 percent. In January 2013, the BoI strengthened liquidity regulations, requiring banks to
adhere to new Basel III-type minimum liquidity coverage ratios, monitor net stable funding
ratios, and strengthen the governance of liquidity management.

26.

Against this backdrop, the BoI’s recent stress tests suggest that even under severe global

crisis scenarios―which assume an impact more severe than what Israel experienced during the 2008
crisis—all banks would be able to maintain a 6 percent core Tier 1 capital ratio.10 These results
validate the broadly reassuring assessment provided by the 2012 FSAP Update.

Under the most severe stress scenario, GDP is assumed to contract for four consecutive quarters (-4 percent
growth annually), unemployment to rise to 12 percent, and house prices to fall a cumulative of 15 percent. Banks’
ROE would fall sharply from around 8 percent to -1 percent, but all banks would be able to maintain the capital ratio
of above 6 percent.

But tail risks to financial stability remain, and continuous efforts to further bolster the
resilience of the system to shocks are imperative
27.
The concentration of loans continues to pose a risk to banks. Banks’ lending to mortgage
markets and commercial real estate amounts to 40 percent of their total assets. To reduce
concentration risks, the BoI has appropriately lowered regulatory exposure limits and has
strengthened credit risk management. Nevertheless, stress-testing of banking sector exposures to
large highly-leveraged corporates—in particular, holding companies and real estate and
construction firms—should continue to be carried out periodically.
28.
If interest rates were to increase, households with floating-rate mortgages would be hit hard.
The BoI’s stress test suggests that with a 20 percent drop in house prices and a sharp increase in
unemployment, many mortgage borrowers, especially those with high DTI and LTV ratios and with
floating-rate mortgages, would default on their loans. But overall, the impact on banks would be
limited because of collateral and open-ended personal liabilities. However, a housing market shock
could lead to a prolonged economic recession, which, taking into account adverse feedback effects,
could indirectly hurt banks’ asset quality and profitability. It is therefore important that risk
diagnoses and assessments from a macroprudential policy perspective are carried out on an
ongoing basis, taking into account macro-financial feedback loops.
29.
The banking supervisor is considering introducing the Internal Ratings-Based approach, with
a view to incentivizing banks to strengthen their risk management capacity. This is appropriate.
Where risks are difficult to assess, regulatory floors should be set on risk weights or on loss given
default estimates.
30.
Corporate lending by non-bank institutions (insurance, pension, and provident funds) has
increased sharply in recent years (about 40 percent growth in 2012). Although the level of such
lending is still low (less than 10 percent of bank loans), a sharp increase could give a cause for
concern. The Goldschmidt Committee (which is currently reviewing regulatory standards for nonbank institutional lending activity) has recently made preliminary recommendations, including a
tightening of corporate governance and a strengthening of transparency. As soon as the committee
finalizes its report, regulations should be strengthened accordingly.
31.
In the insurance area, a Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding with the International
Association of Insurance Supervisors was signed recently. This will facilitate international
cooperation and information exchange in insurance supervision.
Progress needs to be expedited in addressing some key issues identified by the FSAP Update11
32.
The authorities have instituted regular meetings of the three supervisory agencies―the BoI,
the Capital Markets, Insurance, and Savings Division (CMISD) of the MoF, and Israel Securities

ISRAEL

Authority (ISA) ―and the MoF, including to share information, harmonize regulatory practices, and
analyze potential systemic risk factors.
33.
Consistent with the FSAP recommendations, the authorities are considering formalizing this
practice by establishing a Financial Stability Committee(FSC). However, views differ on elements of
the FSC’s mandate, governance structure, and organizational framework, including most importantly
on whether the FSC should focus solely on macroprudential policies in normal times or also be in
charge of crisis management, and who should chair such a committee (the Governor of the BoI, the
Minister of Finance, or both as co-chairs). Staff discussed two options that are currently under
consideration.


Option 1. The FSC will focus on macroprudential policies for normal times. The BoI would play
the leading role, with the Governor serving as the Chairperson. The governance structure of the
FSC would be carefully designed, with a view to ensuring its independence and effectiveness in
carrying out its mandate (namely, information collection, risk identification, and decision
making), while maintaining the autonomy of the financial regulators. The inclusion of nonexecutive committee members may also be considered. At the same time, consideration would
be given to establishing a separate crisis management committee, focusing on crisis
preparedness and management, with the MoF playing the leading role.



Option 2. The FSC shall have two functions, macroprudential policies in normal times and crisis
management when necessary. The Minister of Finance would chair the FSC, although a
compromise solution could involve both the Minister and the BoI Governor serving as co-chairs
of the Committee. The decision making process would recognize the differences between
normal times, where the BoI Governor would play the leading role, and crisis time operations,
where the Minister of Finance would take the lead role. The membership of the committee could
be expanded to include other important government agencies (such as the Prime Minister
Office), but would exclude non-executive members, as the committee may need to share and
deal with confidential information during crisis times.

34.
Staff favors the first option. There is clearly no one-size fit-all model for all countries. But as
a general principle, to ensure the effectiveness of the FSC, institutional arrangements need to
support a policymaker’s ability and willingness to act, by setting clear mandates, assuring
operational independence, and requiring accountability and transparency. In this regard, Option 2
may risk undermining the effectiveness of the FSC’s macroprudential function in normal times,
mainly because many government agencies (which may not have particular expertise in supervision)
might be involved, political independence could be compromised, democratic accountability could
be weakened by the exclusion of non-executive members, and because there is no easy way to
clearly differentiate normal versus crisis times, thus creating governance and accountability
problems.12

35.
Legal reforms to strengthen the BoI’s toolkit for early intervention and resolution, while
clarifying the policy for emergency liquidity assistance and protecting the bank from quasi-fiscal
activity, should proceed apace. Progress has been made in preparing a draft law with technical
assistance from the Fund. All remaining issues need to be addressed expeditiously, with the aim of
submission of the draft law to the Knesset as soon as practicable.

D. Structural Policy: Promoting Longer-term Sustainable and Inclusive
Growth
Further action is required to improve the business climate and boost competition in the non-tradable
sector. In addition, it will be important to enhance the participation of rapidly growing Haredi and
Israeli-Arab populations in economic activity to bolster the economy’s long-term potential and to
reduce poverty and inequality.
There is room to improve Israel’s business environment
36.
To secure strong, balanced and sustainable growth,
further action will be required to improve the business
environment. In particular, it would be important to tackle
the weaknesses identified by the World Bank’s Doing
Business Survey, including in the areas of “property
registration,” “construction permits,” and “contract
enforcement.” Efforts should also continue to address
infrastructure gaps, notably pertaining to railroad, port, and
air transport facilities. Alongside, as the Committee on
Increasing Competitiveness recommended in 2012,
competition in the non-tradable sectors should be enhanced.

Another cause of concern is high poverty among rapidly
growing groups
37.
Despite rapid growth, the poverty rate in Israel
(near 20 percent) remains among the highest in OECD
countries. Much of this high poverty incidence is accounted
for by Haredi and Arab-Israeli communities. Going forward,
given Israel’s demographic profile—in 20 years, the
population of these two groups is projected to exceed
40 percent of the total population—their integration into
the labor force will be essential not only to improve their
welfare, but also to boost labor productivity and the longrun growth potential of the Israeli economy as a whole.13

13

The recent analysis by BoI staff suggests that unless demographic and educational problems are appropriately
addressed, Israel’s long-term growth potential would be reduced by about 1–1½ percentage points of GDP.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISRAEL

38.
These are structural problems. Many Arab-Israeli communities live in underdeveloped rural
and remote areas (thus raising the costs of supplying labor). In addition, many of Haredi and ArabIsraeli children follow different education systems with fewer years of formal schooling (thus
lowering human capital acquisition) and do not participate in military or civic services (thus isolating
them from the social networks that facilitate employment opportunities).14
39.
To address these problems, a number of initiatives are under way, including the expansion of
Haredi units in the defense forces and the opening of public employment centers in Arab-Israeli
towns. In response, preliminary evidence suggests that participation of these populations in the
labor force is rising, albeit slowly. To achieve inclusive growth, more forceful and concerted action
by all stakeholders is needed, especially in the areas of education (including access to higher
education and enforcement of core curriculum), rural infrastructure and transportation, enforcement
of labor laws, and national service arrangements. Private initiatives should also include enhancing
the efficient use of talents across all different populations to fully reap Israel’s productivity potential.

THE AUTHORITIES' VIEWS
40.
The authorities broadly concurred with staff assessment of economic developments, risks
and the contours of the policy response. They agreed that given the moderation in growth
momentum and the still uncertain external environment, the key policy challenge is to support nearterm growth, while preserving long-term sustainability. Some difference of views and issues of
emphasis were, however, elaborated.
Monetary policy and house prices
41.
On monetary policy, the BoI acknowledged a dilemma. On the one hand, the sharp
appreciation of the shekel had weakened the performance of the tradable sector and was seen as a
drag on growth. The shekel was considered to be moderately overvalued. On the other hand, it was
recognized that the low interest rate environment could fuel further house price increases. It was,
however, argued that that the probability of a sharp house price correction is low, given that the
supply of houses is limited. The BoI was of the view that, on balance, monetary policy should remain
accommodative in the near-term, but if this, in turn, led to further house prices increases, it would
be inclined to seek greater recourse to macroprudential measures that directly restrict the size and
risk of mortgages. The BoI also underscored that alleviating supply constraints is the key to cooling
the housing market on a durable basis.
Fiscal policy
42.
The authorities noted that the stance of fiscal policy needed to be framed by judgments
concerning debt sustainability and long-term growth, underscoring that reducing public debt over
the medium-term would remain one of the top policy priorities. The authorities noted that although
14

See Israel 2012 Article IV Consultation Selected Issues, Chapter I, for more detailed discussions.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

ISRAEL

the level of civilian expenditures in Israel is relatively small compared with other countries in the
OECD, economic “outcomes” associated with such spending are high, as evidenced by low mortality
and high life expectancy. In addition, it was argued that there remains further scope for improving
government efficiency and reducing administrative spending without lowering social and welfare
spending. Accordingly, the MoF indicated that fiscal adjustments needed over the medium-term to
put debt on a firmly downward path should come mainly from expenditure cuts, while revenue
raising efforts should be focused largely on broadening the tax base rather than on raising tax rates.
43.
On the fiscal rule, although all options were on the table, the MoF did not see the case for
introducing an explicit debt target, as it was felt that such a target could be subject to frequent
revisions, including because of growth shocks, and would thus not provide a credible fiscal anchor.
Instead, it was argued that laying out the medium-term deficit target would be sufficient to ensure
public confidence in fiscal policy. In this context, the authorities agreed with the importance of
further developing a comprehensive medium-term fiscal and expenditure framework.
44.
The authorities were not fully convinced with the merits of establishing a fiscal council. It was
argued that the key priority should be to strengthen capacity within the MoF. In addition, while the
authorities acknowledged the limits of the BoI’s role in serving as a shadow fiscal council, they
argued that there were significant advantages to the current practice and establishing a new
institution would be costly.
Financial sector and structural policies
45.
On functions and modalities of an FSC, the BoI broadly agreed with staff’s preferred option
of the committee focusing on macroprudential policies in normal times, with the BoI playing the
leading role and its chairmanship assigned to the Governor, and establishing a separate crisis
management committee. The MoF is, however, opposed to this option and favors the establishment
of a single committee (responsible for both macroprudential policy making in normal times and
crisis management when necessary) to ensure a smooth coordination and transition from normal to
crisis times. It was argued that the Minister of Finance should chair this committee, given his overall
responsibility for macroeconomic stability.
46.
On the structural front, the authorities agreed on the need for more concerted efforts aimed
at integrating Arab-Israeli and Haredi communities in economic activity.

STAFF APPRAISAL
47.
The Israeli economy is growing at a moderate pace. Inflation and inflation expectations are
squarely within the 1–3 percent target band, and unemployment is low. The external position is
strong, while Israeli financial markets have remained relatively calm.
48.
But the country faces significant challenges. Israel’s public debt and the fiscal deficit remain
high; house price inflation poses risks of a boom-bust cycle; the appreciation of the shekel raises

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ISRAEL

competitiveness concerns; and the medium-term growth potential is likely to be lower than in the
past.
49.
The key challenge is to pursue an appropriate policy mix to ensure strong and sustainable
growth, while preventing the build-up of imbalances and strengthening the resilience to shocks.
50.
With inflation firmly anchored within the target range and growth momentum at risk from a
strengthening of the shekel and a drag from fiscal tightening, as well as from the still uncertain
external environment, monetary policy should remain on hold for now. Risks of rapid house price
inflation should be addressed with a further tightening of “direct” macroprudential measures. The
BoI should, however, respond nimbly to changes in the economic environment.
51.
The government’s commitment to fiscal discipline is welcome, but the risk of fiscal slippages
should be minimized by a firm adherence to the expenditure ceiling and announced revenue
measures to meet the deficit target for 2014. For 2015 and beyond, efforts on both expenditure and
revenue fronts will be required to put public debt firmly on a downward trend, while preserving
long-term growth and sustainability. A further strengthening of the fiscal framework is warranted,
including by embedding the current fiscal rules within a fully-fledged medium-term fiscal and
expenditure framework. Consideration should also be given to establishing an independent fiscal
council.
52.
The macroeconomic policy mix (accommodative monetary and tight fiscal), combined with
structural reforms to boost productivity, will help alleviate shekel appreciation pressures and boost
the competitiveness of the tradable sector. To reduce the risk of a Dutch disease, arising from capital
inflows associated with gas production, there is merit in pursuing a pre-announced and wellcommunicated program of intervention to offset the impact of natural gas on the external accounts.
This could be complemented by discretionary intervention aimed at stemming exchange rate
volatility.
53.
Ongoing initiatives to strength financial sector resilience are welcome. However, progress
needs to be expedited in addressing some key issues identified by the FSAP Update. In particular,
efforts to establish an FSC need to be intensified, with a clear focus on macroprudential policies in
normal times and with the BoI in the lead. At the same time, consideration should be given to
establishing a separate Crisis Management Committee, focusing on crisis preparedness and
management, with the MoF playing the leading role. The draft bank resolution law should be
submitted to the Knesset as soon as practicable.
54.
To ensure strong, sustainable and balanced growth, more concerted action is required to
improve the business climate and boost competition, especially in the non-tradable sector. In
addition, given Israel’s demographic profile, addressing low labor participation rates of Haredi and
Israeli-Arab communities is important to bolster the economy’s productive capacity and long-term
growth, as well as to reduce poverty and inequality.
55.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Israel be held on a standard 12month cycle.

Annex I. Israel’s External Sector Assessment1
The shekel has appreciated by 20 percent in nominal and real terms since 2007 and is now 10 percent
above its longer-term average. While from an economy-wide perspective, the shekel is broadly in line
with fundamentals, the impact on the tradable sector has clearly been felt. To some extent, Israel may
be suffering from a Dutch disease phenomenon, owing to large capital inflows related to the coming
on stream of gas production and foreign purchases of start-up companies in the high-tech sector.

3.


The appreciation of the shekel has been driven in part by Israel’s sound fundamentals.
Israel weathered the global financial and Euro Area crises relatively well, owing to the absence
of large imbalances in the pre-crisis period. Growth has averaged 3.7 percent since 2008,
compared with 0.7 percent on average in OECD countries.



Since 2003, Israel has maintained a current account surplus of around 2.3 percent of GDP, owing
largely to its dynamic export activity. High-tech manufacturing and services are the main drivers
of export growth in Israel, representing about 50 percent of total industry exports. The
emergence of Israel’s export based high-tech sector is explained by its excellence in technology
development, resulting from sizeable investments in R&D and a large skilled labor force, both of
which are high by international standards.



Net FDI inflows have remained strong. Unlike in other advanced countries, FDI inflows into Israel
did not fall in the aftermath of the crisis. Direct investment in Israel is stable and largely
accounted for by high-tech companies. Although new direct investments are generally the main
driver of inward FDI, in 2012 FDI inflows were largely explained by reinvestments, owing to a
considerable increase in retained profits of foreign companies operating in Israel.



Over the past several years, vast reserves of natural gas have been found in the Israeli off-shore
economic zone, and production from the Tamar field began on April 2013. The gas sector is
estimated to contribute to improving the current account balance by 1–1¼ percentage points of
GDP in 2013 and 2014. Furthermore, Israel could start exporting natural gas by the end of the
decade, which will further contribute to boost the current account balance.

4.

Occasionally, portfolio flows have influenced short-term fluctuations in the exchange

rate.


During 2010 and the first half of 2011, portfolio
inflows soared, as foreign investors brought large
volumes of capital to take advantage of the interest
rate differential between Israel and the major

advanced economies. The appreciation pressures
brought about by these “hot money“ flows receded
shortly thereafter, as speculative capital left the

rate cut, the removal of the tax exemption on
capital gains for foreign investors, and the increase
in the economy’s risk premium. Since then, carry-



In 2012 and 2013, portfolio flows turned negative, mainly because domestic institutional
investors made sizeable portfolio investments abroad. However, in anticipation of further
appreciations, institutional investors increased their hedging positions to protect the value of
their foreign investments in shekels—i.e., they sold dollars forward (mostly to Israeli banks),
which offset the downward pressure (put by their investments abroad) on the currency.2

Model based current account and exchange rate valuations
5.
Staff’s estimates suggest that the exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals.
Results from various equilibrium exchange rate assessment models are mixed.


The estimates for real exchange rate misalignment vary across different methodologies. The
Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate (ERER) measure suggests an overvaluation of 10 percent, while
Macro Balance (MB) and External Stability (ES) measures suggest that the exchange rate is
undervalued by 7 and 8 percent, respectively.



The IMF’s new External Balance Assessment (EBA) suggests that the norm for the current
account balance for Israel is about zero. In 2013, the current account balance is projected at
about ¾ percent of GDP, which in cyclically adjusted terms is about 1¾ percent of GDP. The
deviation of the cyclically adjusted current account from the norm is estimated at about
2 percent of GDP, which can be largely attributed to the impact of emerging natural gas
production.

function of medium-term fundamentals (NFA, relative productivity differentials, the terms of trade, and trade
restrictions). The ES approach calculates the difference between the actual current account balance and the Net

account balance in line with its NFA-stabilizing level.

underpinned by an increase in foreign

liabilities is low by international standards,
and a part of it is denominated in shekels,
thereby reducing the vulnerability of the

Reserve assets have increased

sharply, owing to the intervention policy undertaken by the BoI. In 2009, the BoI modified its
exchange rate policy and announced its intention to engage in discretionary intervention to
counteract excessive volatility in the foreign exchange market, or to affect the level of the exchange
rate, when the latter deviates considerably from its fundamental value. In May 2013, the BoI
launched an additional intervention program, whereby announced purchases of foreign currency are
made to offset the effects of gas production on the current account. Standard metrics – reserves to
monthly imports and reserves to short term external debt ratios- suggest that foreign reserves may
have grown beyond their adequate level. Yet, the authorities’ analysis indicates that the adequate
level of reserves is somewhere between $65–$90 billion. By international standards, reserves
accumulation in Israel does not appear to have been excessive.

manufacturing sector.
Dutch Disease Concerns: Natural Gas and Start-up Companies
10.

So far, the impact of gas discoveries on the current account has been relatively limited,

especially compared to its potential in the future. The impact of natural gas production in
reducing fuel imports has been lower than anticipated, as refinery companies are still importing
energy fuels, in part, in fulfillment of previous contracts. However, these imports have been exported
subsequently, thus contributing to improving the current account balance.
11.

Meanwhile, expectations about future production of natural gas have caused

disorderly movements in the foreign exchange market. The expected improvement in the
current account due to the production of gas has been known for a long time, and has led to some
40

ISRAEL

adjustment in the exchange rate. In June 2013, however, the exchange rate overreacted in
anticipation of future developments in the energy sector, prompting the BoI to engage in
discretionary intervention.
12.

Israel will start exporting gas by 2018, generating major revenues that could

strengthen the currency. Exports of natural gas will contribute to boost the current account
balance. This will put appreciation pressures on the shekel, which could impair the competitiveness
of other industries. Against this background, the government has decided to establish a Sovereign
Wealth Fund (SWF), which will invest gas levy receipts abroad and contribute to the fair distribution
of gas revenues.
13.

Until the SWF is established, the BOI will offset the current account effects of gas

production though reserves accumulation. Since the SWF cannot function before super-profit
taxes are collected, the BoI launched a foreign currency purchase program to offset the balance of
payments effects of natural gas production, as an interim measure. The planned intervention
program—announced in May 2013—was introduced to address concerns related to Dutch disease
effects from the gas sector. Under this scheme, the BoI announces yearly amounts of foreign
currency purchases and executes them on a regular basis throughout the year.
14.

Israeli start-up companies are an important supplier of foreign currency. Start-up

companies raise significant amounts of financing from global investors, notably through venture
capital funds3. In addition, start-ups attract foreign currency flows through “exits”; that is, the sale of
an Israeli firm to large foreign—often US-companies. About 60 Israeli companies are currently
traded in NASDAQ, one of the largest numbers of non-US listed companies. Furthermore, many of
the leading international high-tech companies, such as Intel, Apple, Microsoft, Cisco and IBM, have
established R&D activities in Israel.
15.

But start-up exits could also be giving rise to a Dutch-disease phenomenon. In most

countries, FDI inflows entail a transfer of technology from overseas, which stimulates domestic
investment and mitigates appreciation pressures on the exchange rate. By contrast, an important
fraction of FDI flows into Israel have the same properties as portfolio investments: through start-up
exits, which are recorded as inward FDI or exports of services4, foreigners acquire know-how and

materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the
risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability
between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The matrix reflects staff views on the

August 2009: to reduce potential default losses
in response to interest rate increases, banks
were required to tighten their risk management,
scrutinize the mortgage loans to households,
and enhance disclosure, particularly with respect
to loans carrying floating interest rates that were
extended to households.



July 2012: a 100 percent capital surcharge was
imposed on groups of borrowers, who buy new
built residential properties collectively, and who
also engage with third parties to execute the
construction and development of residential
projects.





March 2010: to reflect better the true risk
inherent in bank business models, a new
treatment was required for loans taken out by a
“purchasing group”—individuals who organize
themselves for the joint purchase of land rights,
in part, to get tax benefits. Loans extended to
purchasing groups were required to be classified
as “construction and real estate” credit, which
embed a higher risk.

November 2012: LTVs for housing loans were
capped at 70 percent —excluding first-time
buyers, for whom a maximum LTV of 75 percent
was imposed. In addition, the LTV for mortgage
loans for investment purposes was capped at
50 percent.



February 2013: To restrict the supply of
mortgages, capital requirements and
provisioning for mortgages was tightened. For
loans with an LTV between 45 and 60 percent
capital risk weights were raised from 35 percent
to 50 percent. For loans with an LTV above
60 percent, the risk weight was raised to
75 percent. The allowance for credit losses from
housing loans was raised — such that the ratio
between the group allowance and the balance
of housing loans is at least 0.35 percent.



August 2013: To restrict the supply of risky
mortgages the debt-to-income ratio (DSI) of
new loans was capped at 50 percent; capital
surcharges were imposed on mortgages with
DSI between 40–50 percent; the maximum
repayment period was set to 30 years; and the
floating component of mortgages was capped
at two-third of the loan. This applies to all
mortgages with an adjustable rate component,
and comes in addition to the limitation imposed
in May 2011.



July 2010: To increase banks’ loss absorption
capacity in the event of a housing crisis or an
economic downturn, supplemental reserve
requirements of 0.75 percent were instituted for
all outstanding mortgages with a Loan-to-Value
ratio (LTV) that exceeds 60 percent.



October 2010: to further improve banks’ loss
absorption capacity and reduce the supply of
risky mortgages, a capital surcharge was
imposed on high-risk housing loans. The riskweight factor for mortgages with a floating
component of over 25 percent, an LTV of at
least 60 percent, and a mortgage value higher
than NIS 800,000 was raised from 35 to
100 percent.



44

May 2011: to reduce the probability of
mortgage default in the event of an interest rate
increase, the variable component of mortgages
was capped at 1/3 of the principal amount of
the loan, for mortgages with an adjustable rate
period of less than 5 years. In addition, banks
were asked to notify customers whose mortgage
loans carry a floating interest rate component
that applies to one-third or more of their loan.

Annex IV. Israel: Debt Sustainability Analysis 20131
Public debt sustainability has substantially improved, with the debt-to-GDP ratio decreasing from
98 percent in 2003 to 68 percent in 2012.2 The debt structure would help to assure resilience to shocks,
with debt maturity averaging 7 years and debt held by non residents amounting to 18 percent of the
total. Nevertheless, high interest payments and elevated gross financing needs still place the country in
a vulnerable position. Although most indicators are below early warning benchmarks, Israel’s debt
profile appears to be highly vulnerable to growth shocks.
1.
Under staff’ baseline scenario, public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline to
about 61 percent of GDP in 2018, a path consistent with the authorities’ implicit goal of
reducing public debt to 60 percent of GDP by 2020 (Figures A4.1-A4.3). The DSA covers debt of
the general government. The baseline scenario is underpinned by the following assumptions:


Real GDP is projected to grow at about 3.5 percent annual average. The output gap is expected
to be broadly closed through the projection period;3



CPI inflation is expected to remain constant at 2 percent;



The budget deficit is expected to improve from 3.5 percent of GDP in 2013 to about 3 percent of
GDP in 2014. Thereafter, it is projected to remain at about 2 percent.



The primary expenditure is projected to remain constant as percentage of GDP.4



The effective interest rate is forecast to slowly decline from 5.5 percent in 2013 to 4.5 percent in
2018, as the debt outlook improves and borrowing conditions—facilitated by comfortable
sovereign ratings (A+ and A1) and the US debt guarantee program (about 15 percent of external
debt until 2016)—remain favorable.



However, as the level of interest payments would remain elevated throughout the projection
period, gross financing needs would hover around 12 percent of GDP.

1

For more information, please consult http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/dsa/mac.htm

2

The analysis is for the general government, including both tradable and non tradable debt. Non tradable debt have
been issued to institutional investors with the set terms based on long-standing arrangements. These non-tradable
debt has been declining over time given the reduction of designated bond issuances to pension funds.
3

Staff’s scenario does not assume a boom-bust scenario presented in Figure A4.2.

4

The expenditure path envisaged by the authorities to attain the deficit targets has not yet been specified; but it will
be probably different from the current expenditure rule in place.

2.
Risks to the baseline remain to the downside, as indicated in the Figure A4.1, given that
the adjustment plan is ambitious given historical fiscal performance, and fiscal slippages will result in
higher debt levels.

Shocks and Stress Tests
3.
A range of stress tests indicate that debt sustainability is particularly susceptible to
growth, interest rate, and combined macro-fiscal shocks (Figures A4.4 and A4.5).


Growth shock. Lower real GDP growth rates (by 1 standard deviation for 2 years starting in 2014)
would lead to a slower improvement in the primary balance, as revenues fall (while expenditure
remains unchanged). Financing needs would increase to 15 percent of GDP by 2018. The debtto-GDP ratio would rise to 70 percent in 2015 and then would decline only slowly to 66 percent
by 2018.



Interest rate shock. A geopolitical shock might raise market concerns about medium-term debt
sustainability, pushing up borrowing costs by 200 basis points. Financing needs would jump to
15 percent of GDP by 2018, while public debt would stay broadly constant at 65 percent of GDP
for the projection period as an average high maturity of new borrowing would maintain the rate
of debt accumulation low.



Combined macro-fiscal shock. A shock that combines exchange rate depreciation, an expansion
of the primary deficit and a decline in real GDP would raise financing needs to 17 percent of
GDP and debt would reach 70 percent of GDP by 2018.

4.
Finally, a tail risk scenario, combining house price shock with a geopolitical shock, is
considered. The scenario assumes that: (i) interest rates increase by 200 basis points; (ii) real
exchange rates depreciate by about 13 percent; and (iii) house prices drop by 20 percent. Because
impact on growth is highly uncertain, the results of debt sustainability are presented for two growth
scenarios (Figure A4.6).


Moderate impact on growth: The growth decline is assumed to take place over three years
(about 0.7 percent less than the baseline in 2014 and 2.3 percent less in 2015–16). Under this
scenario, gross financing needs would expand to 20 percent of GDP, and public debt would
reach 79 percent of GDP by 2018.



Severe impact on growth: The growth decline is concentrated in 2015, with growth rates lower
than the baseline by 1.5 percent in 2014, 5 percent in 2015, and 2.9 percent in 2016. Under this
scenario, gross financing needs would rise to 25 percent of GDP and public debt to about

1/ Public sector is defined as general government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over German bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

The BoI employs a variety of models to estimate credit losses for four different sectors: real estate and
data as well as other methodologies based on loan level data. In other areas, work is still in progress, especially
in the area of construction risks and liquidity stress tests.
For the second straight year, the BoI is conducting stress tests based on a uniform scenario in conjunction with
banks. And it has recently completed a stress test on banks’ mortgage portfolios based on loan-level data.
The BoI has already constructed several indices to assess systemic risk and its sources, and is currently working
on enhancing the toolbox. These are planned to be integrated in stress testing and in macro models to better
assess the contribution of systemic risk to the broader economy.

The CMISD has taken several measures to increase transparency.
1. Draft regulation documents are published in two rounds, first to obtain public feedback and afterwards the
industry feedback.
2. Prior to amending major regulations, the commissioner publishes a “green paper" which includes a number of
approaches where the public are invited to address the issues (e.g. concentration accountants, LTC – Long Term

On May 7, 2012, the Knesset approved an amendment to the Prohibition on Money Laundering Law. The
amendment applies the AML/CFT regime on dealers in precious stones sector. The sector will be supervised by
the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Labor and will be subject to Administrative sanctions. An AML/CFT order has
yet to be enacted for the amendment to come into force and specify the obligations.
In addition, on May 11, 2012, a draft bill concerning the application of AML/CFT obligations on DNFBPs’ was
approved in first reading by the Knesset Plenary but has not been enacted yet. A draft order applying AML/CFT
obligations on DNFBP’s has been disseminated to representatives of the relevant sectors (Lawyers, trusts service
providers, accountants, tax consultants and real estate agents) and meetings were held with them in order to
improve cooperation and to reach agreed understandings in advance.
Transparency of beneficial ownership
Information on beneficial ownership is retained by AML/CFT regulated businesses as part of their compliance
obligations. The AML/CFT Orders determine the obligation to receive from the customer a declaration stating

Finally, the Corporations Authority has undertaken in the past two years measures to ensure compliance with
the annual reporting requirements for private companies that include relevant details about directors and
shareholders. Some of these companies are also required to submit their balance sheet annually. These
measures included the implementation of sanctions against “violating companies” as well as public campaigns
to increase compliance and public awareness of these reporting requirements. The information reported is

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of January 24, 2014)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Macroeconomic statistics are of generally high quality and broadly adequate for surveillance,
although there are few shortcomings particularly in monetary and government finance statistics. A Report
on the Observance of Standards and Codes—Data Module, a Detailed Assessments Using the Data
Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF), and a Response by the Authorities were published on the IMF
website on March 24, 2006 (IMF Country Report No. 06/125).
National Accounts: No issues to report.
Price statistics: No issues to report.
Government finance statistics: The methodology underlying the reported overall annual fiscal balance
is not in conformity with internationally accepted best practice, as interest expenditure excludes the
inflation component. The authorities are gradually moving toward implementation of the methodology
that is standard in other countries, so that the discrepancy will decline over time. Quarterly data
submitted by the Central Bureau of Statistics broadly follows the GFSM 2001 format. However, for
financial assets and liabilities, only transaction data are currently submitted, although a financial balance
sheet (stocks of financial assets and liabilities) is under preparation. Within-year monthly reports on
central government operations—compiled by the MoF—cover only the main aggregates of budgetary
accounts, not broken down by components.
Monetary statistics: Banking statistics are not based on balance sheet reporting, but instead on a
selection of data reported by banks to the regulatory authorities. Current information does not permit full
sectorization of the economy in the monetary statistics, and more detailed information on instruments
also would be useful.
Balance of payments: Balance of payments and international investment position data are compiled on
a quarterly basis and follow the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. External sector data were
not examined in the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes
II. Data Standards and Quality
Participant in the Special Data Dissemination
System (SDDS) since April 1996, and in full
observance of the SDDS’s prescriptions for data
coverage, periodicity and timeliness, and for the

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Israel
February 10, 2014
This statement provides information that has become available since the issuance of the
staff report. The new information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
The budget performance for 2013 is projected to be better than previously
anticipated. December data on budget execution point to an overall fiscal deficit of
3¼ percent of GDP for 2013, an improvement from the 4¼ percent expected in the Budget
Law and the 3½ percent projected in the Staff Report. The better-than-expected performance
relative to budget stems from lower expenditures (around 0.5 percent of GDP), owing to tighter
spending control, and higher revenues (around 0.7 percent of GDP), owing largely to greaterthan-anticipated revenue collections from one-off measures (such as taxes collected on “trapped”
profits of multinationals and from the sale of start-up companies in the high-tech sector).
Revenue collection was also boosted by a rebound in the stock market and higher real estate
taxes.
2.
The Government has submitted to the Knesset a revised expenditure rule. The
new formula is based on a target debt ratio of 50 percent of GDP (10 percentage points less
than what is used in the prevailing rule) and caps real expenditure growth at population
growth (currently 1.7 percent) plus one percent. The new formula implies lower real
expenditure growth, consistent with deficit targets set through 2020.
3.
On January 22, 2014, the Government raised €1.5 billion in new debt issuance.
The initial offering was aimed at raising €1 billion, but investor bids totaled €5.7 billion,
inducing the Government to increase the amount sold. The bonds were issued for a period of
10 years with a yield of 2.932 percent.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 12, 2014

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Israel
On February 10, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Israel.
Israel's economic fundamentals remain strong. GDP growth is solid, unemployment is low, and
inflation remains firmly anchored within the 1–3 percent target range. The financial sector is in
good health and the external position is strong.
However, excluding the impact of a new large-scale natural gas production, growth momentum
is expected to remain moderate, as planned fiscal tightening and a further strengthening of the
currency will weigh on the economy and offset, in part, the pick-up in demand in Israel's major
trading partners. The economy also faces other important challenges: public debt remains high
despite a noticeable decrease over the past several years; rapid house price inflation, if it persists,
poses risks to financial stability; and the large employment and productivity gaps between the
general Jewish population, the Ultra-Orthodox Jewish (Haredi) and Israeli-Arab communities, if
sustained, could undermine the economy's long-run growth potential.
Given the still uncertain global environment, as well as the headwinds to growth from fiscal
tightening and exchange rate appreciation, monetary policy should stay the course. But the Bank
of Israel should respond nimbly to changes in the economic environment. A further tightening of
macroprudential measures may be needed to alleviate risks of a boom-bust cycle in the housing
market. On the fiscal side, the likelihood of slippages in meeting the deficit target should be
minimized by firm adherence to the expenditure ceiling and full implementation of announced
revenue measures. In addition, to put public debt firmly on a downward trend, further adjustment
is required in 2015 and beyond, along with a strengthening of fiscal institutions. This policy mix,

forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

combined with structural reforms to boost productivity, should help alleviate appreciation
pressures on the shekel and boost competitiveness.
In line with the recommendations of the 2012 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP)
Update, a Financial Stability Committee should be established, led by the Bank of Israel and
focusing on macroprudential policies in normal times. Legal reforms aimed at strengthening the
bank resolution framework should be legislated as soon as practicable.
On the structural front, concerted action is required to boost competition in the non-tradable
sector, while it is imperative to promote the participation of Haredi and Israeli-Arab populations
in the labor force to reduce poverty and inequality and bolster the economy's long-run productive
capacity.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the Israeli economy’s resilience through the global crisis, which
has been underpinned by sound macroeconomic and financial fundamentals. They also
welcomed the progress made in reducing public debt and the government’s commitment to fiscal
discipline.
Directors noted that growth would continue to be moderate, but the outlook is vulnerable to
external and longer-term domestic risks. Weak external demand and appreciation pressures on
the shekel are a drag on growth, house prices continue to rise rapidly, public debt is high, and
growth is not inclusive. Against this backdrop, Directors underscored that policies should aim at
ensuring sustainable growth, preventing the build-up of imbalances, and deepening structural
reforms to bolster the economy’s productive capacity and to reduce poverty and inequality.
With inflation well anchored within the target range, a still uncertain external environment, and
headwinds to growth from the planned fiscal tightening and a stronger currency, Directors agreed
that monetary policy should maintain the current stance. Should growth prospects improve more
than anticipated, the monetary stance would need to be gradually normalized. Directors
considered that the risks ensuing from rapid house price increases should be addressed through a
further tightening of macroprudential measures.
Directors commended the authorities for the bold fiscal consolidation measures embedded in
the 2013–14 budget. They noted that strict adherence to the expenditure ceiling and full
implementation of the announced revenue measures will be necessary to meet the fiscal targets.
2

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3
Directors concurred that achieving the deficit targets and ensuring debt sustainability would
require further fiscal adjustment in the medium term through efforts on both the expenditure and
revenue fronts.
Directors considered that embedding the current fiscal rules within a fully-fledged medium-term
fiscal and expenditure framework would strengthen the budgetary and fiscal institutions. Most
Directors agreed that establishing an independent fiscal council would enhance the credibility
and transparency of fiscal policy while a few other Directors were of the view that the current
framework has served the economy well.
Directors noted that the mix of accommodative monetary and tight fiscal policies, alongside
reforms aimed at boosting productivity, would alleviate appreciation pressures on the currency
and improve competitiveness. In this context, Directors saw merit in the Bank of Israel
continuing their program of pre-announced foreign exchange intervention, aimed at alleviating
risks of appreciation pressures emanating from promising prospects of large-scale natural gas
production. Directors recognized that discretionary intervention may be needed to stem excessive
exchange rate volatility.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ ongoing initiatives to buttress the financial system. They
underscored that progress could be expedited on the key issues identified by FSAP Update. In
particular, they encouraged the authorities to establish a Financial Stability Committee with a
clear mandate and operational independence, and to legislate the draft bank resolution law as
soon as practicable.
Directors noted that low labor participation of the Arab-Israeli and Haredi populations
exacerbates inequality and poverty concerns and would undermine the economy’s long-run
growth potential. They welcomed recent reforms and encouraged the authorities to promote
further the integration of these groups in the labor market.

Statement by Menno Snel, Executive Director of Israel and Amit Friedman Advisor to
the Executive Director
February 10, 2014

1. The Economy and Economic Policy
The performance of the economy is solid. The Israeli economy is operating at a nearpotential level, and growing at a moderate but stable pace of above 3 percent, which is high
by advanced-economy standards, but is probably below its potential. The unemployment rate
fell in the last quarter of 2013 to 5.7 percent, and the participation rate is high; the external
position is robust, as illustrated by the current account surplus and the net investment
position being in positive territory; the public deficit is down to 3.2 percent of GDP1 and
public debt fell to 66.7 percent of GDP. Inflation, at 1.8 percent, is fairly close to the
midpoint of the inflation target band, the financial system is robust, and the financial markets
are calm.
The policy mix is growth-friendly. The current policy mix, which includes expansionary
monetary policy and moderately tight fiscal policy, is designed to support economic activity
while facilitating the continuation of fiscal consolidation, as reducing the public deficit and
the public debt-to-GDP ratios is a major goal of the government’s economic agenda. A set of
housing-related macro-prudential policies geared to restrain excess demand and contain risks
to financial stability, have been implemented by the BoI.
Not all is bright, however, and a mix of short-run and fundamental challenges looms.
Growth is mostly driven by local demand, as weak global demand and exchange rate
appreciation are a drag on export growth. Moreover, appreciation pressures persist. Growth is
not inclusive, and does not trickle down to the middle class in full. The high cost of living,
and especially elevated and still rising housing prices are a source of social tension. In the
medium run and beyond, formidable challenges related to the inclusion of groups that are
weakly attached to the labor market lie ahead. These issues keep policymakers and society
alike occupied, and are at the heart of ongoing public debates.
2. Fiscal Policy
Fiscal policy is designed to reduce the levels of deficit and debt, which are still above
the desirable levels, while keeping tax rates at competitive levels. The high deficit in
2012 led to a slowdown in the process of debt reduction. Following the formation of the
1

2
new government in 2013, a biennial budget for 2013-2014 was adopted that includes a
series of corrective actions to secure the consolidation process. The budgetary results so
far are better than expected, and the deficit came down from 3.9 percent in 2012 to 3.2
percent of GDP in 20132. Furthermore, the deficit in 2014 is expected to be 3.0 percent of
GDP, which is expected to yield an additional modest reduction in the ratio of debt to GDP.
It is important to put the 2012 fiscal slippage, on which staff elaborates, in context. First,
even in 2012, the debt to GDP ratio was reduced by 1.4 percent of GDP. Thus, the slippage
was not so significant so as to jeopardize debt reduction. Secondly, the slippage was
promptly dealt with, including by an initial, unpopular, VAT hike in late 2012 just before the
elections.
The 2015 budget looks tight and the Ministry of Finance acknowledges the challenge.
The deficit target for 2015 is 2.5 percent. A revised expenditure rule, which caps the growth
of public expenditure by the rate of population growth, which is currently 1.7 percent, plus
one percentage point at most, was approved by the government and sent to the parliament.
This rule ensures that expenditures are lower than potential growth, and hence the increase in
the tax burden in 2015 and onwards, required in order to meet the declining deficit targets,
will be modest. With a broad-based VAT set at 18 percent, a CIT at 26.5 percent, and a
marginal PIT rate at 50 percent, the MoF sees only limited scope for further tax rate hikes.
Consequently, an effort to reduce exemptions will be made.
Fiscal policy is guided by well-defined fiscal rules. Fiscal policy is guided by two rules:
an expenditure rule that caps the maximum growth of the real expenditure, and a deficit
target expressed in percent of GDP. Every budget has to meet the terms of both. The
forecasts on which the deficit targets are based are judged - by staff - to be conservative and
unbiased, but as the deficit target is not cyclically adjusted, and there are no escape clauses
that define when and how the deficit trajectory is modified, substantial unexpected revenue
shortfalls tend to result in discretionary recalibration of the targets.
The current fiscal rules and institutions have proven to be useful. This two-rule
framework, which has been in place since 2005, proved to be useful for conducting
responsible yet flexible policies, and it was previously assessed by the Fund to have helped
reduce public debt from very high levels.3 The results speak for themselves: since this
framework is in place, debt went down from 89.8 percent of GDP to 66.7 percent of GDP.
Yet, when the global financial crisis hit, the framework was flexible enough to let the
automatic stabilizers operate in full. Thus, the MoF does not see a clear advantage in
explicitly introducing the debt ratio into the fiscal rule, while the disadvantage is that the rule

becomes more pro-cyclical, which is undesirable. The current framework, however, can be
improved, and the MoF fully agrees with staff that strengthening the monitoring and analysis
of the medium-term projections of expenditures is of the essence. Regarding the institutional
setup, since the MoF tax revenue forecasts are unbiased and the BoI is providing a highquality, independent assessment of the fiscal position, the authorities are not fully convinced
that there is a case for an independent fiscal council, given the large costs involved in
establishing and maintaining a high-quality council.
The strong fiscal position was demonstrated recently in the international financial
markets. On January 22, 2014 Israel sold 1.5 billion euro worth of 10-year eurodenominated sovereign bonds in London, at an average yield of 2.93 percent and bid-tocover ratio of 5.7. The low spread over comparable German bunds, 117 bp, reflects the
strength of the fiscal position and the trust in the economy.
3. Monetary and Macroprudential Policies
The BoI’s policy is geared to support economic activity under an inflation targeting
regime, while containing risks to financial stability and pressures on the currency. As
economic activity slowed down, inflation pressures dissipated, and the appreciation pressures
on the shekel intensified, the interest rate has been reduced gradually during 2013 from a rate
of 2 percent to currently 1 percent. The lower spread between the policy rate and those of the
major advanced economies takes off some of the appreciation pressures and the low rate
provides additional support for private consumption and investment. Market-based inflation
expectations remained close to the midpoint of the 1-to-3 percent inflation target band
throughout the interest rate reduction process.
The exchange rate intervention policy is aimed at curbing overvaluation. Foreign
exchange intervention policy is based on two pillars. The first pillar is a non-discretionary
program designed to offset the effect on the current account of lower energy costs resulting
from locally produced natural gas. The quantity of foreign currency purchases under this
program is communicated to the public in advance, and in October 2013 the BoI announced
that in 2014 the purchases will amount to US$ 3.5 billion. The purpose of this policy is to
temporarily substitute for a lacking SWF, and to ease the Dutch disease symptoms that the
Israeli economy seems to display. The second pillar of exchange rate intervention is
discretionary and designed to curb excessive appreciation beyond that attributed to
fundamental factors. The current level of the shekel - which is already affected by this policy
- is assessed to be moderately overvalued, and the BoI occasionally acts whenever additional
pressure on the shekel builds up.
A set of macroprudential measures is used to reduce the risks associated with the low
level of the interest rate. In order to offset the undesirable effect of low interest rates on the
risks associated with the elevated level of housing prices, a series of macroprudential

4
measures were taken. These include direct measures such as capping the LTV to 70 percent
and debt services to income to 50 percent, and limiting the mortgage repayment period to 30
years. In addition a series of indirect measures aimed at reducing the risks associated with
mortgage lending, both to banks and to households, were implemented. As some of the MPs
were implemented recently, and the full data on the housing market are available at a
considerable lag, it is probably too early to assess the policy’s impact. The BoI is
encouraged, however, by the initial evidence, as well as by staff's assessment, that points to
the effectiveness of direct measures, and it stands ready to tighten these measures if they
prove to be insufficient.
4. Financial Stability Issues
The financial system is solid and conservative, and the banks are stable, liquid, and
profitable. As part of a gradual adoption of Basel III starting in 2015, the core capital ratio
further improved to 9.3 percent. The quality of the banks' credit portfolio is high, with NPLs
as low as 3.1 percent of total loans; deposits equal 89 percent of outstanding credit, and the
direct exposure to international markets is low.
The financial system is robust and tightly supervised. The regulators, namely the Banking
Supervision Department of the BoI, the Capital Markets, Insurance, and Savings Division of
the MoF, and the Israel Securities Authority are exchanging information and analyses
regularly through a joint working group that analyzes systemic risks. The authorities realize
the necessity of establishing a formal Financial Stability Council. The report lays out two
clear options to move ahead with the process, and the authorities are grateful for the
constructive and thorough suggestions made by staff. A continued effort to resolve the
outstanding impediments is currently taking place.
A new bank resolution framework is underway. The authorities would like to thank
management for promptly accommodating their request for TA on this issue, and staff for
providing a valuable contribution to finalizing the draft law for early intervention and
resolution. The authorities expect to solve the remaining issues in the near future.
The authorities are grateful to the Article IV team for the excellent, analytical report they
have written and for the open and constructive dialogue behind it.
