STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Outlook and risks: Amidst a fragile global economic environment, real GDP growth is
projected to moderate to 4 percent in 2012 from 5 percent in 2011. The uncertain
external environment poses downside risks to mineral export demand and calls for a
delicate balancing act in the implementation of macroeconomic policies.
Near-term policy mix and managing global spillovers: A tight fiscal stance, adopted
in the FY2012/13 budget to help rebuild the policy buffers, combined with an
accommodative monetary policy stance, is appropriate. In the event that further
adverse global spillovers lead to a significant decline in diamond revenues, staff advises
the authorities to allow the automatic stabilizers to operate on the revenue side.
Medium-term fiscal consolidation: Reining in spending is the main pillar of the
authorities’ fiscal consolidation strategy. Efforts to reduce the wage bill should be
accompanied by reforms of government employment and wage policies. Broadening
the tax base would provide a stronger foundation to the fiscal consolidation objectives.
Monetary operations, financial intermediation and stability: The government’s
domestic bond program should help to share the burden of sterilization costs between
the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Botswana. Efforts to broaden the population’s
access to financial services and deepen financial intermediation should be combined
with adequate safeguards to preserve the stability of the financial system.
Inclusive growth, unemployment, and institutional and capacity development:
Botswana faces long-term development and structural challenges that it needs to
address to move the country to a higher level of development. Current redistributive
aspects of fiscal policy should be complemented with policies that tackle inequality
through fostering effective investment in education and health and enhancing financial
inclusion. Faster economic growth, a change in public sector employment policies, and
measures to address the skill mismatch in the labor market should help to reduce the
unemployment rate. The authorities’ ongoing mid-term review of their National
Development Plan (NDP 10) provides an opportunity to consider measures that would
foster institutional and capacity development in support of long-term growth.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The authorities agreed with the mission’s assessment of recent economic developments, outlook, and
prospects. Given the uncertain and fragile external environment, they shared staff’s view that the
period ahead requires a delicate balancing act in the implementation of macroeconomic policies.
With risk-based surveillance as the backdrop to the consultation, tailored to the policy challenges
facing a small middle–income country (MIC) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), this year’s consultation with
Botswana used an issues-oriented surveillance framework. Thus, the policy discussions focused on four
main themes: (i) Managing near-term macroeconomic policy mix and spillovers from the global
economy; (ii) rebuilding policy buffers through high-quality medium-term fiscal consolidation to
buttress external stability; (iii) strengthening monetary operations, financial intermediation and
stability; and (iv) enhancing inclusive growth, reducing structural unemployment (relevant macro
critical social issues), and fostering institutional and capacity development in support of long-term
growth. The authorities’ Vision 2016 and NDP10 also place emphasis on these policy challenges, which
bodes well for gaining traction. They acknowledged that while mineral wealth has propelled Botswana
to a high middle-income status, long-standing structural challenges which no longer exist in some of
the other high middle-income countries and are often found in economies with much lower level of per
capita income, remain. With some of these policy themes also relevant for other MICs in SSA, crosscountry analysis and best practice policy advice underpinned by analytic work in a MIC clustered group
featured prominently in the consultations (Figure 2).

On the linkage between the Pula

that the Pula Fund inflows and outflows are
guided by their macroeconomic policy

government is not able to invest in productive
domestic investment are transferred to the
Pula Fund thus treating the Fund as a residual.
By the same token, current spending is

During the last six months, the BoB

has enacted reforms in its liquidity
management operations. The key goal was
to reduce sterilization costs that have severely
affected the BoB’s balance sheet in recent
years, a challenge that many other central
banks around the world have faced. The
reforms should reduce the amount of liquidity
absorbed through the issuance of the Bank of
Botswana Certificates (BoBCs), the main
instrument used to mop up excess bank
liquidity. This resulted in a significant reduction
in the quantity of BoBCs offered for auction.
The reforms also included an increase in the
reserve requirement for banks and more
frequent use of reverse repo operations.

Box 1. Botswana: Structure and Performance of the Financial Sector
Botswana’s financial sector has evolved over the years, and featured new entrants, mergers and
acquisitions, and orderly exits. The banking sector has expanded from two to eight banks
serving the domestic market and two banks operating as offshore banks. The banking system is
profitable, liquid, and well capitalized with capital adequacy ratios well above prudential norms
(Table 5). In addition to institutional movements, there has been a progressive widening of
services, coverage and innovation, in the context of the authorities’ financial sector
development strategy and regulatory oversight, as well as global developments regarding the
banking business model and information and communications technology. While financial
exclusion decreased by 13 percentage points in 2009 compared with 2004, access to financial
services remains low with estimates of financial exclusion at about 33 percent (number of
adults without access to financial services).

Staff recommendations
31.

Staff supports the main thrust of the

BoB’s recent reforms in its liquidity
management operations. The reforms will
likely promote more financial intermediation
and put the BoB’s balance sheet on a
sustainable footing. Staff discussed with the
BoB various options to re-establish the
traditional link between its policy rate and
short-term interest rates, including the use of
the reverse repo to credibly set the overnight
rate corridor supported by a standing facility.
This would enable market participants to
respond appropriately to changes in the
monetary policy stance, and anchor inflation
expectations better. Increased issuance of
treasury paper should facilitate the burdensharing of sterilization costs and provide
investment opportunities for nonbanks.
32.

Although efforts to broaden

financial inclusion and deepen
intermediation are consistent with both
Vision 2016 and NDP10, these need to be
accompanied by adequate safeguards to
preserve the stability of the financial
system. The introduction of innovative
products to broaden the population’s access
to financial services would require measures to
contain possible risks, including money
laundering. Staff called for efforts to develop a
reliable property market index to help monitor
price developments and take appropriate

established financial stability unit to put in
place a macro-prudential framework and
strengthen information sharing with foreign
supervisors on cross-border flows.
33.

Staff underscored the need to

strengthen the regulatory and supervisory
framework for NBFIs. The emphasis here is
on the potential risks NBFIs pose to the
domestic financial stability, including through
regulatory arbitrage. The cross-linkages
between the bank and non-bank parts of the
financial system are significant. Thus, any large
shock to the non-banking system could
reverberate through the banking system and
pose systemic stress across the financial
system and thus to the broader
macroeconomy.

While Botswana’s per capita income

is well in the high middle-income category,
capacity is unevenly distributed across the
government and weaknesses are found in
areas that crucially need to be addressed
before the economy can move to a higher
level of development. Government
effectiveness indices prepared by the World
Bank suggest that, for Botswana, the private
sector’s perceptions of the quality of public
services and civil service bureaucracy are more
positive than, for example, those for Cape
Verde, Namibia, and Seychelles, but have
remained broadly unchanged over the last
decade. Botswana’s relative weaknesses are in
institutional effectiveness, excessive red tape,
and poor allocation of public resources for
rural development (Appendix IV).

Tackling the high level of

unemployment in Botswana will require

should focus on changing public employment
and wage policies (see Policy Theme 2) and
aligning the curricula for university and tertiary
education and vocational training to meet the
demand for skilled labor in the broader
economy. The government’s Economic

Fiscal year begins on April 1.

2

SACU receipts consist of taxes on international trade and excise on imported goods as well as the impact of a development component derived from excises.

3

Includes transfers received from the Bank of Botswna (BoB) on account of interest income on government investments made by the BoB on behalf of the
government.

4

The non-mineral primary balance is computed as the difference between non-mineral revenue and expenditure (excluding interest payments and receipts, which
are roughly proxied by BoB transfers and interest).

Appendix III. Botswana: Long-Term Fiscal Sustainability Benchmarks

The standard permanent income hypothesis
argues that the preservation of wealth would
require that spending in each period be
limited to the permanent income or the
implicit return on government wealth. To
compute this “permanent” income, the
projected stream of mineral revenue is
transformed into a hypothetical annuity with
the same net present value as the revenue. The
annuity reflects the permanent portion of the
country’s mineral wealth. The benchmark

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: On November 30, 2010, the government of Botswana gazetted the commencement of
the Statistics Act of 2009. Under the Act, the Central Statistics Office (CSO), which had been a
department of the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning, was transformed into Statistics
Botswana (SB), responsible for the country’s statistical system. SB will operate independently of the
Ministry of Finance and Development Planning, with its own board of Directors.
Macroeconomic data are adequate for surveillance, but some shortcomings exist in terms of
accuracy and reliability of the source data and the statistical techniques used in the compilation of
national accounts, government finance, and balance of payments statistics. The timeliness of the
central bank survey and detailed government expenditure data by economic classification needs to
be increased to better support economic analysis and prepare Botswana for an eventual
subscription to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). Further improvements would
include dissemination of readily available information on monthly production of diamonds and
quarterly aggregate financial soundness indicators.
The authorities are working on a number of fronts to improve data quality and dissemination:
(i) source data and methodologies are being reviewed for those data with obvious estimation
problems/gaps, (ii) stronger collaboration is being sought among source data producers to secure
consistency and reconcile discrepancies across data sets; (iii) the production of leading economic
indicators is currently underway; and (iv) staff shortages are being addressed within budget
constraints. A national population census is scheduled to begin the current fiscal year.
National Accounts: National accounts estimation has not kept pace with changes to the structure
of the economy and needs to be rebased (the current base year is 1993/94). The Household
Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) (2002/03) and Labor Force Survey (2005/06) are out of date.
Preliminary estimates based on the Botswana Core Welfare Indicators Survey (BCWIS) 2009/10
were realeased in late 2011. More frequent surveys would support a more robust estimation of
private consumption and a better understanding of poverty and unemployment.
Price Statistics: The official monthly consumer price index (CPI) is available on a timely basis in the
SB’s website. The index is comprehensive and provides breakdowns between urban and rural price
data, and between prices of tradable (domestic and imported) and nontradable goods and
services. Estimates from an outdated HIES are currently used for the weights of market expenditure
for goods and services. Compilation challenges include undertaking a new HIES (ongoing) and the
eventual inclusion of owner-occupied housing price data in the CPI. Compilation of producer or
wholesale prices has been discontinued.
Government Finance Statistics: The concepts and definitions used in compiling government
finance statistics generally follow the guidelines of the IMF’s 1986 Government Finance Statistics
Manual (GFSM 1986) but cover only budgetary central government activities. No fiscal statistics are
compiled for extra budgetary institutions, consolidated central government, or consolidated
general government. No decision has been made by the authorities on adopting a “migration
path” to the GFSM 2001 methodology, although the authorities are working with the Fund
Statistics Department (STA) toward that endeavor. Recurrent and development expenditure data
are published in an aggregate form. Development spending comprises a mixture of current and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 7

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX BOTSWANA

capital spending.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Compilation practices are consistent with the Fund’s Monetary
and Financial Statistics Manual. The central bank survey is currently available with a lag of usually
about three months, which is well short of the two-week period recommended in the SDDS. STA’s
recommendation is to make preliminary data available with clear identification of data status. The
authorities prefer a more cautious approach to data dissemination to avoid reputation damage if
the data require revisions. The BoB is seeking to expand the coverage of financial statistics to
include the operations of nonbank financial intermediaries (NBFI), such as pension funds, insurance
companies, and other financial corporations, such as unit trusts, finance companies, and financial
auxiliaries. STA’s recommendation is to focus on data collection in a handful of large institutions
within each NBFI category.
Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Statistics: Annual and quarterly
balance of payments data are published in the Botswana Financial Statistics (BF) and the BoB’s
Annual Report. Preliminary data are generally disseminated within two months of the end of the
reporting period, while revised (final) data are available after nine months. The concepts, structure,
and definitions of the balance of payments statistics follow the fifth edition of the Balance of
Payments Statistics Manual (BPM5). Source data are adequate, but the International Transaction
Reporting System (ITRS) data—as opposed to alternative survey data on services and transfer
items in the current account—has become unreliable. Data compilation, estimation, and
adjustments mostly employ sound techniques, but the methods used for estimating missing data
(for example, unrecorded trade), f.o.b. /c.i.f. adjustment factors to import values, and flows from
stock data are inadequate. Discrepancies exist in national accounts data concerning: (i) the
valuation of diamond exports and (ii) imports, exports, and payments related to settlements within
the Southern African Customs Union (SACU). Large errors and omissions in the 2008–2010 balance
of payments statistics have complicated the assessment of external sustainability.
The BoB conducts an annual survey of Botswana’s investment and international investment
position (IIP). A quarterly IIP survey is also produced for internal use with data from the ITRS.
External Debt: Public external debt data are of good quality and but timeliness could be improved
(the latest published data is for March 2009).
II. Data Standards and Quality
Botswana has participated in the GDDS since late 2002. A Data ROSC and its updates were
published in April 2002, March 2004, and April 2007, respectively.
III. Reporting to STA
Monetary data are reported for publication in International Financial Statistics using Standardized
Report Forms and Botswana reports annual balance of payments and IIP data to STA. No
government financial statistics are currently reported for publication in the Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook.

The Botswana’s historically low level of public
debt reflects the authorities’ prudent
macroeconomic policies. This resulted in a
significant reserve accumulation, which
allowed them to face the Great Recession with
strong policy buffers. Therefore,
countercyclical policies were successfully
implemented without much debt accumulation.

The second scenario assumes no change

(1.4 percent of GDP) throughout the
medium-term. In this case, public debt
decreases to 7.2 percent of GDP by
2017/18. The outcome of this scenario is
similar to that of the baseline scenario
since primary fiscal balance in 2012/13 is

The bounds tests illustrate the sensitivity of the
public debt-to-GDP ratio to exogenous shocks
(Figure 1). The most benign shock is that
stemming from keeping fiscal policy
unchanged. Public debt is relatively vulnerable
to primary fiscal balance and growth shocks.
These shocks generate an increase in debt-toGDP ratio by 18 and 9 percentage points
respectively.

MEDIUM–TERM EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
Botswana’s gross external debt increased

of export growth, supported by a steady

Power Corporation to finance the construction
of the Moropule B energy plant and loan
disbursements from the World Bank to cover
an array of social and institution-building
programs. The latter included, among others,
the development of databases at Statistics
Botswana, capacity-building initiatives at
NBFIRA, and a medium-term debt strategy at
the Ministry of Finance and Development
Planning.
The stock of Botswana’s gross external debt is
projected to decline gradually from a peak of
about 23 percent of GDP in 2009 to about 6
percent of GDP in 2017 (Table 2).

An alternative scenario, with key debt-creating
variables at their historical levels, suggests
that Botswana could become a net creditor
vis-à-vis the rest of the world over the
medium-term. This is a notable improvement
over the baseline projections (Figure 2).
Simulations suggest that Botswana’s external
debt-to-GDP ratio is sensitive only to current
account shock. Real depreciation shock, while
increases the debt-to-GDP ratio initially, have
only marginal impact on the medium-term debt
dynamics. Moreover, Botswana’s external
debt is not sensitive to the shock of interest
rates and economic activity.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Botswana
On July 25, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Botswana on a lapse of time basis. Under the IMF’s lapse of time
procedures, the Executive Board completes the Article IV consultations without convening
formal discussions.1
Background
Botswana’s economic recovery after the 2008–09 financial crisis was one of the strongest
among middle-income countries (MICs), but its growth weakened in the second half of 2011.
Real GDP grew by 5.1 percent in 2011 (just below the average for its peer MIC group)
compared with 7 percent growth in 2010. The growth deceleration was driven by a significant
slowdown in diamond exports during the second half of the year. However, the non-mineral
sector registered a brisk growth during the year, despite a significant fiscal withdrawal. Diamond
sales for the first quarter of 2012 showed only a very modest recovery.
At the same time, while receding, inflation remains relatively high. Consumer price inflation
(year on year) declined from 9.2 percent in December 2011 to 7.7 percent in May 2012, which is
higher than the upper end of Bank of Botswana’s (BoB) medium-term objective range of 3–6
percent. Core inflation (excluding food, fuel and administered prices) has declined slightly in the
last few months. Alternative measures, including the trimmed mean, also suggest a downward
trend in core inflation.
Notwithstanding the moderation in growth, conditions in financial markets have improved.
Private sector credit growth is now approaching pre-crisis level, supported by a strong growth in
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares
a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

credit to businesses. Bank’s nonperforming loans fell notably in the second half of 2011
because of a significant improvement in the quality of loans to households. Increased interest
and non-interest income, combined with lower provisions for nonperforming loans, contributed
to the rebound in banks’ profitability.
The fiscal outcome was better than planned. The overall fiscal deficit in FY2011/12 was about 2
percent of GDP, compared with the budget target of about 6 percent. The non-mineral primary
deficit also declined from about 24 percent of non-mineral GDP in FY2010/11 to 17 percent in
FY2011/12. The adjustment reflects a sharp decline in government spending mainly due to
savings generated in the education budget owing to the increase in the number of students
admitted to local tertiary institutions, rationalization of student allowances and improved
administration, as well as better prioritization of development spending. Higher-than-expected
customs revenue from the Southern Africa Customs Union (SACU) Common Revenue Pool
also contributed to the lower deficit.
The overall external position also strengthened in 2011, with annual export growth (in dollar
terms) of about 40 percent. Exports grew faster than imports turning the current account deficit
into a surplus for the first time in the last three years. Diamond exports benefited from higher
diamond prices in the first half of 2011, which more than offset the poor performance of copper
and nickel exports. Besides mining, plastic products and textile exports surged in 2011.
However, exports of meat and meat products fell compared with 2010 because of the restriction
on meat exports to the European Union related to the non-compliance with the EU’s export
requirements. The real effective exchange rate lost ground slightly over the last 12 months.
The fragile global economic environment suggests that Botswana’s growth will likely moderate
in 2012. Over the medium term, real GDP growth is expected to stabilize at around 4.5 percent,
while inflation is expected to converge to the upper band of the BoB’s medium-term objective
range in 2013. With projected fiscal surpluses in FY2012/13 and beyond, the current account
surplus is forecast to stabilize at about 2 percent of GDP. The main near-term risks relate to the
highly uncertain external environment, which remains fragile and poses significant downside
risks to mineral export demand.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2012 Article IV Consultation with Botswana, Executive Directors endorsed
staff’s appraisal, as follows:
The current fragile global economic environment is likely to delay the pace of recovery in
Botswana. Trend growth will likely moderate over the medium term as the historical success
over diamond wealth continues to fade.
Against this backdrop, the authorities’ current policy mix of fiscal restraint and an
accommodative monetary policy stance is appropriate. In a more adverse global economic
scenario, the authorities should allow the automatic stabilizers to operate on the revenue side.
Bolder measures are required to achieve the targeted reduction in the wage bill. Such measures
include streamlining the system of non-wage payments, rationalizing the size and structure of

3
government, tightening the link between pay and performance, strengthening payroll systems,
and revising the wage scale.
Broadening the tax base should be an integral part of the authorities’ fiscal consolidation
strategy. Staff strongly recommends conducting a full-fledged study on tax expenditure to
provide a solid foundation for streamlining tax incentives to specific activities that absolutely
need it.
The authorities should adopt a fiscal anchor that delinks the fiscal stance from volatile mineral
revenue and SACU receipts. Thus, staff reiterates the need to adopt either the non-mineral
primary balance or the structural fiscal balance (à la Chile) in the formulation of fiscal policy.
Staff supports the main thrust of the Bank of Botswana’s recent reform in its liquidity
management framework. Greater coordination between monetary operations and debt
management through enhanced issuance of treasury securities should help to support the
needed burden-sharing of sterilization costs.
The authorities should pay close attention to macro-financial linkages. The high level of
exposure of the banking system to household debt is a significant source of vulnerability and
warrants close monitoring.
There is an urgent need to strengthen the capacity of the non-bank financial institutions’
regulator. The rapid expansion of these institutions has propelled them into a systemically
important component of the financial system, while the capacity of the non-bank regulator to
supervise these large institutions lags behind. The cross-linkages between the bank and nonbank parts of the financial system constitute potentially an additional risk to the financial system.
Botswana faces long-term development and structural challenges that it needs to address to
move the country to a higher level of development. Current redistributive aspects of fiscal policy
should be complemented with policies that tackle inequality through fostering effective
investment in education and health and enhancing financial inclusion. As one of the largest
employers in the economy, the government has an important effect on economy-wide wage
settlements and job creation. Thus the reform of the public sector employment policies is critical
to enhancing job creation in the broader economy. Fostering deeper institutional and capacity
development should be an important part of the government’s reform agenda to support longterm growth.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
