EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•
The economic situation has improved since the last Article IV consultation.
Growth has rebounded, led by investment and exports, and the fiscal deficit has narrowed
owing to temporary tax measures and expenditure control. Inflation has remained around
10 percent, in line with the exchange rate crawl. The external current account deficit has
declined and international reserves have increased.
•
Despite these improvements, the Costa Rican economy continues to face
significant vulnerabilities. Fiscal and external imbalances remain large, international
reserves should be strengthened; the public debt and the external debt are high; financial
dollarization is growing; and the banking system has some weaknesses that need to be
addressed.
•
Several reforms are under consideration that would start addressing these
vulnerabilities. A tax reform before congress is designed to raise revenues by about
2 percent of GDP, and approval of CAFTA and associated reforms would help support an
improved growth outlook. The authorities are also planning to strengthen the central bank
and the banking system’s supervisory and regulatory framework.
•
While welcoming these initiatives, the staff recommended the adoption of a
comprehensive reform agenda to ensure sustained rapid growth in an environment of
financial stability.
¾ Fiscal consolidation. The fiscal primary surplus should be raised to about 3½ percent
of GDP over the medium term (from a projected 0.3 percent in 2004) to ensure
sustainable debt dynamics. To this end, the staff urged prompt approval of the tax
reform, a strengthening of tax administration, public enterprise reforms, a rollback of
revenue earmarking, and pension reform. The staff supports the authorities’ plan to
recapitalize the central bank to shift its quasi-fiscal deficit to the budget.
¾ Improving monetary management and greater exchange rate flexibility. The staff
endorses the authorities’ aim to reduce inflation to the low single digits, supported by
improved monetary management and eliminating the central bank’s quasi-fiscal
deficit. The staff recommended a gradual move toward greater exchange rate
flexibility and adoption of inflation targeting. The authorities believe that the crawling
peg regime has served Costa Rica well, but agreed that the options for the monetary
framework should be kept under review as fiscal policy and the central bank are
strengthened.
¾ Financial sector reforms. The staff urged the authorities to speed up the
implementation of banking reforms to alleviate systemic risks and help reverse
dollarization. The authorities are planning a focused effort to implement the priorities
identified in the 2001 FSAP and subsequent TA missions, including effective
implementation of consolidated supervision, strengthening the superintendency of
banks’ supervisory and enforcement powers, and improving the bank resolution
framework.

I. BACKGROUND
A. Political and Social Environment
1.
Costa Rica has a long record of political stability under a system that operates
largely by consensus. The benefits of this system are evident in a broad national agreement
on core institutional pillars of stability and social peace, but it also grants large influence to
special interest groups that tend to oppose reforms. In mid-2003, a long strike by public
sector unions over pensions and government control of public enterprises led to the
resignation of the finance minister and to delays in the implementation of reforms.
2.
President Pacheco—whose four-year term expires in May 2006—remains
popular, but the government does not have a majority in congress. The ruling party
(Unidad Social Cristiana) holds only one-third of seats in congress, and the political
landscape has become more fragmented after the constitutional court lifted the ban on
presidential reelection in 2003. Nonetheless, there are signs that the main opposition party
(led by former President Arias) supports key reform legislation in congress. The next
presidential and legislative elections are
scheduled for February 2006.
Costa Rica: Social Indicators

3.
Costa Rica has the best social
indicators in Central America. Costa
Rica made substantial progress in
reducing poverty in the 1990s.1
Education levels are high and health
indicators strong, with high life
expectancy, low infant mortality, and
wide access to sanitation and safe water
(Table 11).

public debt rose to over 50 percent of GDP by
end-2002. Financial dollarization increased, and an FSAP in 2001 identified a number of
weaknesses in the prudential framework (¶33). Net international reserves (NIR) remained at
around two months of imports.2
5.
The economic situation improved in 2003, supported by the favorable external
environment. Real GDP grew by 5½ percent, boosted by a recovery of exports and private
investment. Inflation declined slightly to under 10 percent, although the rate of crawl was
raised to 10½ percent, and unemployment fell to 6 percent. The external current account
deficit declined to 5¼ percent of GDP. The rate of crawl was reduced to 9 percent at the start
of 2004.
6.
However, progress with reforms has been limited. During the last
Article IV consultation, the authorities indicated their intention to introduce a number of
reforms in the fiscal and financial sectors. Several reform proposals have since been
presented to congress, but most of them have yet to be approved, as summarized in Table 12.
7.
The overall public sector deficit
narrowed to 5.2 percent of GDP in 2003
(5.7 percent in 2002). The primary balance
shifted to a surplus of 0.3 percent of GDP
(deficit of ½ percent in 2002). Despite
temporary tax measures, revenue fell relative
to GDP reflecting weak tax administration
and the concentration of growth in taxexempt sectors. To contain the deficit, the

authorities relied on strict control over central government spending, especially transfers.
Investment in the public enterprises rose significantly (by 2½ percentage points of GDP), but
this was not fully reflected in the fiscal accounts as enterprises, in particular the large state
electricity and telecommunications company (ICE), relied mainly on public-private
partnerships (PPPs) to carry out these projects.3
8.
Public debt reached a new high of
nearly 55 percent of GDP in 2003. Borrowing
rose sharply as the government took advantage
of favorable market conditions to pre-finance
some of its 2004 needs (1 percent of GDP). The
share of foreign-currency debt rose to
59 percent at end 2003 (58 percent excluding
the pre-financing; Appendix I).

to 16 percent (from 20 percent). Credit to the private sector continued to grow rapidly (by
nearly 10 percent in real terms), but the growth of broad money decelerated as private capital
inflows slowed following a narrowing of interest rate differentials. By end-2003, 55 percent
of private sector credit was denominated in foreign currency.

Losses have not been fully sterilized over concerns of the impact on domestic interest rates.

-8-

10.
Domestic investment funds managed by local banks experienced a sharp decline
in their value in March–May 2004.6 The decline was triggered by the turning in the interest
rate cycle in the United States and an associated correction in the price of Costa Rican
sovereign bonds, which account for a sizable portion of funds’ holdings. Investors in these
funds experienced significant losses, as investments in these funds are valued on a markedto-market basis. Investors also made sizable redemptions in anticipation of further losses.
These redemptions went mainly into deposits at domestic banks, which increased their
holdings of sovereign bonds (mostly marked-to-market in the banks’ balance sheets). Banks
also on-lent part of the redemptions to the investment funds, taking advantage of a temporary
increase by the central bank of the funds’ borrowing ceilings (from 10 percent to 30 percent
of required capital). This allowed the funds more time to liquidate their assets. The price of
sovereign bonds has stabilized since early June, and the funds have started to repay the loans
received from banks. Since early March, the value of the funds has declined from about
US$3 billion to US$1.5 billion (equivalent to about 25 percent of total bank deposits).
The balance of payments strengthened in 2003. A sharp increase in exports (mainly
11.
computer parts) more than offset higher profit remittances and imports (capital goods and
oil). Foreign direct investment (FDI) amounted to 3¼ percent of GDP, covering 60 percent of
the external current account deficit. Large borrowing by the public sector and short-term
private capital inflows contributed to a buildup in NIR to US$1.6 billion at end-2003 (twoand-one-half months of imports).
Although the level of the real exchange rate appears adequate, other indicators
12.
suggest that competitiveness needs to be strengthened. The colón has declined by about
15 percent in real effective terms over the past two years, mainly reflecting the fall of the
U.S. dollar since end-2001. Nonetheless, high relative unit labor costs and a decline in Costa
Rica’s market share suggests that external competitiveness, while not an immediate concern,
should be strengthened. This is particularly important in preparation for the upcoming
implementation of CAFTA, growing competition from East Asia, and the expiration of the
Multi-Fiber Arrangement in 2005.

Costa Rica reached a free-trade agreement with the United States and other
13.
Central American countries (CAFTA) in early 2004. The agreement will consolidate the
benefits enjoyed by Costa Rica under the Caribbean Basin Initiative and provide for other
structural changes, including a gradual removal of state monopolies in telecommunication
and insurance.7 Costa Rica also concluded a free-trade agreement with the Caribbean
countries (CARICOM) in early 2004.

BOX 1. THE FUND’S POLICY ADVICE AND IMPLEMENTATION

•
Policy implementation in Costa Rica has been more gradual and less comprehensive
than recommended by the Fund. In recent Article IV consultations, Directors have repeatedly
stressed the need for fiscal consolidation, improved monetary management, greater exchange rate
flexibility, banking reform, removal of state monopolies, and further trade liberalization. In the event,
the authorities have been able to deepen trade reform, but in light of political constraints, they opted
for a more gradual and partial approach in other areas, especially with fiscal, monetary, and financial
sector reforms. Implementation of Fund technical assistance recommendations has also been mixed,
although progress has been made in the area of banking system and statistics.
•
The authorities acknowledged that there had been some differences of view with the
Fund on the scope and pace of reforms, but noted that this had not prevented a fruitful policy
dialogue and agreements in many policy areas. They noted the challenge of approving often
difficult reforms in a consensus-based society as Costa Rica, but expressed a strong commitment to
addressing the vulnerabilities of the economy. The authorities also indicated their appreciation for
the Fund’s technical assistance and their intention to act fully on its recommendations, even if
implementation may take time.
7

Existing legislation grants a monopoly power to the government in the area of insurance.
Legally there is no state monopoly in the telecommunication sector, but activities in these
areas are de facto controlled by ICE.

II. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
A. Near-Term Outlook

14.
While growth moderated somewhat in early 2004, the near-term economic
outlook remains favorable. Real GDP is expanding at a pace of 4 percent, boosted by the
continued strength of the U.S. economy, although export growth (mainly computer parts) has
slowed from the rapid pace of last year. Twelve-month inflation has risen to 11½ percent
through May owing to higher oil prices, but core inflation remains stable at around
10 percent, broadly in line with the rate of crawl.

demonstrated by a limited wage
adjustment granted in early 2004
(3½ percent for the first half of 2004). Use of the 2003 pre-financing would allow a small
decline of the public sector debt (to 54 percent of GDP at end-2004).
16.
The external position would remain broadly unchanged. The external current
account deficit is projected to remain at about 5¼ percent of GDP as a decline in non-oil
imports would compensate for a slowdown in exports and an increase in oil imports. While
FDI would remain broadly unchanged, the capital account surplus would narrow reflecting a
decline in borrowing by the public sector (after last year’s pre-financing) and private capital
inflows (owing to a correction in financial flows to emerging markets). As a result, NIR are
projected to decline by US$150 million in 2004 (to US$1.5 billion or two months of
imports).

- 11 -

B. Medium-Term Baseline

17.
Under current policies, the medium-term outlook would improve only
moderately. A baseline scenario prepared by the staff, which assumes passage by congress of
the tax reform and CAFTA, points to real GDP growth of about 3 percent per year over the

medium term, faster than in the early 2000s, but not yet at the 1990s pace, as failure to
implement additional reforms would prevent Costa Rica from taking full advantage of the
new trading opportunities. With unchanged monetary and exchange rate policies, inflation
would remain at current levels of around 10 percent. The tax reform would raise the public
sector primary surplus to some 2 percent of GDP, supporting a limited reduction in the public
sector debt. With these assumptions, the external current account deficit, which has been
largely associated with the fiscal deficit, would narrow to 4½ percent of GDP by 2008. FDI
would continue to finance about 60 percent of the current account, but some deceleration in
portfolio investment from recent high levels is likely. NIR would rise broadly in line with
imports.
Significant vulnerabilities would remain under this baseline scenario. In
18.
particular:
•
The public debt/GDP ratio would still be around 50 percent by 2008, leaving the
fiscal position vulnerable to shocks. According to staff simulations, a temporary shock
combining slower real growth, a lower primary balance, and higher interest rates would raise
the public debt by 6 percentage points of GDP by 2008 relative to the baseline.8 A 10 percent
depreciation of the colón would add 5 percentage points of GDP to the debt by 2008.

8

One standard deviation shocks relative to the ten-year historical average affecting the
economy in 2004–05 (Tables 15 and 16).

- 12 -

•
The external position would remain fragile in the face of shocks. Staff simulations
indicate that a temporary shock combining lower real growth, an increase in the non-interest
current account deficit, an increase in the nominal external interest rate, and a decline in the
GDP deflator growth rate (in U.S. dollars) would increase the external debt (both public and
private debt) by about 4 percentage points of GDP by 2008 compared to the baseline
scenario.8
•
The crawling peg would remain a source of vulnerability. Financial dollarization
is bound to continue as the exchange rate would remain the best predictor of inflation. At the
same time, the peg is a vulnerability in the face of external shocks, especially in light of the
relatively low level of international reserves.
•
The banking system would remain subject to risks. In the absence of
comprehensive reforms to strengthen prudential regulation and supervision, incentives would
continue to exist for regulatory arbitrage, dollarization, and weak risk management. The
banking system is mainly vulnerable to interest rate risks and to currency-induced credit risk
from lending to non-dollar earners. Banks also are exposed to sovereign risk. Recent events
in investment funds highlight the risks for the financial system of the changing global interest
rate environment. There is also the challenge of bringing the substantial offshore operations
under appropriate supervision.

19.
Failure to approve the tax reform and CAFTA would signal growing political
paralysis, affect adversely growth prospects, and leave the fiscal and external outlook
increasingly vulnerable. In an adverse scenario without these two critical priority reforms, it
would be difficult to sustain even the moderate levels of investment and total factor
productivity observed in the early 2000s. Under these circumstances, real GDP growth could
decelerate to around 1½ percent of GDP by 2008, in an environment of rising inflation. The
primary balance would remain around zero and the public debt would rise steadily to over
60 percent by 2008. A rising fiscal imbalance would raise the external current account deficit,
with external debt reaching 36 percent of GDP by 2008. Concerns about fiscal and external
sustainability would be compounded by difficulties in continuing to attract FDI, decreasing
international reserves, further dollarization, and banking sector weaknesses.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS

20.
The discussions centered on a comprehensive strategy to address Costa Rica’s
vulnerabilities and boost growth in a lasting way. Such a strategy should aim at further
fiscal consolidation, improvements in monetary and exchange rate management, banking
system reforms, and steps to improve competitiveness and the investment climate. The
measures recommended by staff and the proposed sequence are summarized in Table 14.
Costa Rica is well positioned to benefit from such an effort. A strengthened
21.
macroeconomic framework, further opening up the economy to private competition, and
other reforms to improve the business climate and competitiveness would help boost
investment, productivity, and growth. In an “active-policy scenario” prepared by the staff, the

- 13 -

implementation of tax reform, CAFTA, and other priority measures would signal strong
political support for reforms and could lead to a rebound of GDP growth to close to 5 percent
(the level recorded during the 1990s) based on increased domestic investment and exports.
Measures to raise the primary surplus of the public sector to about 3½ percent of GDP, would
set the public debt dynamics on a robust downward path (to 43 percent of GDP by 2008). A
strengthened monetary framework, facilitated by the transfer to the budget of the central bank
losses, would help bring inflation down to the low single digits, in an environment of
increased exchange rate flexibility, and allow for a sustained buildup of international
reserves.

22.
The authorities broadly agreed with the staff’s assessment, although they
envisaged a somewhat more gradual implementation of reforms than proposed by the
staff. With the presidential campaign starting in 2005, certain reforms may be difficult before
the elections, especially in the area of government spending. This view was shared by the
broad spectrum of representatives of congress, political parties, civil society, and the private
sector that met with the staff. In these meetings, the staff noted growing awareness of Costa
Rica’s economic vulnerabilities and support for reforms, but also a consensus that the most
difficult reforms would probably need to wait until after the 2006 elections.
A. Fiscal Policy

23.
The staff urged additional fiscal consolidation to ensure sustainable public debt
dynamics. To raise the primary surplus to about 3½ percent of GDP over the medium term,
the proposed tax reform (2 percent of GDP) should be followed by reforms on tax
administration on the expenditure side, and in public enterprises, to yield an additional
1½ percent of GDP. The authorities, while agreeing on the need for an additional fiscal effort,
considered that a somewhat smaller primary surplus (around 3 percent of GDP or slightly
less) could be sufficient to ensure debt sustainability, especially as they felt that with further
reforms economic growth may be stronger than assumed in the staff’s active scenario.

- 14 -

24.
Approval of the proposed
tax reform is critical. This reform
proposal, prepared with assistance
from FAD, would raise additional
revenue from a broadening of the tax
base and elimination of tax
loopholes.9 The proposed reform is
supported by the main political
parties and is making good progress
in congress; the authorities expect
final approval by July 2004.

Tax administration needs
25.
to be strengthened to ensure sustained revenue gains from the tax reform. Based on
recommendations of a recent FAD TA mission, staff urged the adoption of an action plan to
tighten control of large taxpayers, eliminate cross-crediting between taxes, limit tax
withholdings to reduce refunds (an area of leakage), and strengthen the tax agency, including
by giving it special powers to collect tax arrears. The authorities agreed that improved tax
administration is central to the tax reform and noted plans to implement FAD
recommendations as soon as the tax reform is approved.
Expenditure reforms will also need to contribute to the fiscal effort. In particular,
26.
staff stressed the need to contain the upward trend of the wage bill, phase out revenue
earmarking, and limit rising pension payments.10 The authorities noted that steps are
underway to contain expenditure growth by reducing wage indexation and strengthening
procurement procedures, especially in the health care system. They agreed with the staff’s
recommendations for limiting revenue earmarking and pension reforms, although creating
domestic consensus on these reforms might take time.

9

The package before congress is broadly in line with FAD recommendations, except for
proposals to introduce a limited dual VAT rate structure and a reduction in the maximum
marginal corporate income tax rate.

10

Expenditure reform is considered a key priority by both the World Bank and the IDB. The
World Bank’s country assistance strategy approved in May 2004, envisages a highly selective
lending program focused on projects to enhance equity and efficiency of education, coverage
and quality of water and sanitation, improvement of financial sustainability of the
environment sector, and efficiency of government operations. Additionally, the CAS includes
a substantial program of knowledge and advisory services and analytical work to support
reforms in critical areas, such as public sector debt management, debt-market development,
financial sector reform, and management of private participation in infrastructure.

•
Wages and employment. The public
sector wage increase for the first half of 2004
was held at 3½ percent (less than inflation),
halting a long upward trend in real wages. The
staff welcomed this action, but expressed
concern about a 2 percent rise of public
employment in 2003 that will push the wage
bill up in 2004. The authorities noted that this
was a one-time increase required by reforms in
education and security. The staff stressed the
need to gradually reduce the public sector
wage bill in relation to GDP.

Rolling back revenue earmarking.11 The staff urged a reduction of widespread
earmarking, which has contributed to substantial budget rigidity. The authorities noted that
most of the legally-mandated earmarking has been suspended since mid-2003, although the
constitutional court has recently called this suspension into question (a final decision is still
pending). A more permanent solution could be provided by a 1999 bill still in congress that
seeks to phase out earmarking. The authorities intend to revive the bill if the court were to
reinstate the suspended earmarking.
•
Pension reform. The authorities agreed with the staff on the need to halt the rapid
increase of pension outlays. To strengthen the finances of the basic pension system (which
faces an actuarial deficit), they are developing proposals to raise contributions and the
retirement age, and lower the reference wage for pension payments. While these reforms do
not require congressional approval, the authorities prefer to generate broad domestic
consensus before proceeding with them. The staff urged similar reforms for the unfunded
special regimes, where pension outlays are also growing rapidly.
The performance of public enterprises also needs to improve. CAFTA will
27.
contribute to this objective by fostering competition with the private sector in areas until now
controlled by public enterprises, although additional measures are needed to strengthen the
contribution of these enterprises to the fiscal effort.
•
The authorities agreed with the staff that public tariffs should be adjusted in line with
changes in operational and debt-service costs.

11

Costa Rica has two kinds of revenue earmarking: (i) constitutionally-mandated earmarking
for education (6 percent of GDP) and the judiciary (6 percent of tax revenue or 0.8 percent of
GDP); and (ii) legally-mandated earmarking in a number of other areas, totaling almost
2 percent of GDP.

- 16 -

•
They noted substantial progress in ensuring that public enterprises, especially ICE,
operate within the overall strategy and financial goals approved by the government.12 Within
these parameters, the goal is to strengthen the enterprises’ commercial orientation and make
them compete with private operators on a level playing field.13 The staff supported this
overall strategy while cautioning against the risk of giving unreformed enterprises too much
latitude, particularly in their employment, investment, and borrowing policies.
•
The staff welcomed the increased reliance on operational PPPs to carry out
investment projects, while stressing that they should entail meaningful efficiency gains with
appropriate risk sharing, monitoring, and accounting. The authorities indicated that these
operations are conducted with full transparency and under the control of the government, and
reassured the staff that there have been no government guarantees or contingent liabilities
related to them.

28.
The staff urged the authorities to proceed expeditiously with their intention to
recapitalize the central bank and shift its quasi-fiscal losses to the budget. The
authorities agreed with the staff that this action, while not changing the consolidated fiscal
outlook, is critical to enhance the central bank’s capacity to implement monetary policy.14 It
would also enhance fiscal transparency, and help ease pressures on the government to
allocate the yield of the tax reform to new spending programs. The authorities intend to
submit a draft bill to this effect soon after the approval of the tax reform, although they noted
that considerable efforts will be needed to explain this reform to the public.
There is scope to further improve public debt management. In recent years, the
29.
maturity debt structure and its currency composition has deteriorated, as efforts have been
made to limit the financing cost of the public debt (see Appendix I). The authorities were
confident about their ability to manage the gross financing needs of the public sector (nearly
20 percent of GDP in 2003). Staff recommended reduced reliance on foreign-currency shortterm borrowing. Efforts are also needed to strengthen risk management, including of currency

12

The authorities have recently put in place a financing oversight committee (formed by the
minister of finance, the president of the central bank, and the minister of planning) which will
establish binding financial guidelines for all public sector entities.
13

A proposal has been presented to congress to strengthen ICE’s ability to compete with the
private sector by giving it more flexibility in the conduct of its commercial operations.

14

The staff estimated that a recapitalization of some 11 percent of GDP would be required to
shift the central bank quasi-fiscal losses (about 1½ percent of GDP per year) to the budget.

- 17 -

risk, and further improve investor relations. The authorities agreed with the thrust of the
recommendations, and explained that efforts were already underway in most of these areas. 15
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies

30.
The authorities agreed with the staff on the need to bring inflation down to low
single-digit levels. They expect fiscal consolidation and recapitalization of the central bank
to ease the burden on monetary policy and allow a progressive slowdown of the rate of crawl,
thus leading to a significant decline of inflation.16 The staff welcomed the intention to bring
down inflation and strengthen the central bank’s ability to conduct monetary policy, in line
with the recommendations of a recent MFD TA mission. These include further steps to take a
more forward-looking approach to monetary policy, strengthen the central bank’s inflationforecasting abilities, and improve its understanding of monetary transmission mechanisms.
The staff recommended a shift over time toward inflation targeting and greater
31.
exchange rate flexibility. Such a shift would provide greater flexibility to deal with shocks
and facilitate adjustment to structural change, while providing a new anchor for domestic
price stability. The staff emphasized that the move to a new monetary and exchange rate
framework would need to be well prepared and supported by reforms in other areas,
particularly fiscal consolidation, strengthening the central bank’s capacity to implement
monetary policy, and developing exchange market infrastructure (including hedging
instruments to cope with exchange rate volatility). A buildup of international reserves would
also be needed to support the credibility of the new regime.
The authorities felt that the crawling peg had served Costa Rica well and saw no
32.
need for change in the immediate future. They noted that the regime had provided a strong
anchor for confidence and expectations, and facilitated Costa Rica’s development into a
highly open economy (with trade of goods accounting for some three-fourths of GDP).
Nonetheless, they agreed that the system should be kept under review, and expressed their
intention to put in place the preconditions that would give the new government taking office
in 2006 the option of moving to a different regime. They looked forward to continuing a
close dialogue with the Fund in this area.

15

To support these efforts the authorities have requested participation in the World Bank’s
Program of Country Assessment and Reform Plan in Debt Management and Domestic Debt
Market Development.
16

The recapitalization of the central bank will have no effect on the debt sustainability
assessment since the central bank debt is already included in Costa Rica’s debt statistics.

C. Banking System

33.
Although progress has been made

The staff urged further reforms to complete the restructuring process
34.
recommended by the 2001 FSAP. A comprehensive bank reform proposal has made little
progress in congress since 2001. The authorities explained that the broad scope of the
initiative made it difficult to achieve domestic consensus. For this reason, they have decided
to give priority to the more urgent reforms, in line with the recommendations of a recent
MFD mission. In particular, they are working on:
•
A streamlined proposal to be submitted to congress in 2004 to: (1) provide for
consolidated supervision of financial holdings; (2) strengthen sanctions for noncompliance
with prudential regulations; and (3) improve the bank resolution framework, including a
strengthening of the lender-of-last resort facility (LOLR).17
•
Actions to reinforce further onshore supervisory controls and to broaden the scope
and effectiveness of the agreements for joint supervision with other countries where offshore
banks are located.
•
Further strengthening the superintendency of banks, especially its ability to audit
information and risk management systems.
The staff welcomed these efforts, and encouraged several additional reforms. In
35.
particular, a broader reform is needed to level the playing field between public and private
banks, onshore and offshore banks, and colón and dollar intermediation. The staff also
17

- 19 -

recommended strengthening liquidity management, including the payments system, interbank
money market, and open market operations; creating buffers against systemic risks, including
those associated with large holdings of sovereign debt; ensuring that banks’ ongoing
recapitalization programs remain on track; and granting no further forbearance on capital
requirements. The authorities agreed with the thrust of these recommendations and reiterated
their commitment to implement the needed reforms over time.
The authorities agreed with staff on the importance of halting and eventually
36.
reversing financial dollarization. While achieving this goal would be challenging and take
time, the authorities and staff concurred on the key elements of a strategy to this end:
(1) fiscal consolidation; (2) improving the capacity of monetary policy to deliver sustained
low inflation; and (3) implementing the steps recommended by a recent MFD TA mission to
restore the colón’s ability to compete with the dollar and ensure full internalization of the
risks of dollar-intermediation. In particular, the authorities noted that they have encouraged
banks to promote (existing and new) price-indexed instruments to help foster colón
intermediation.
The situation of investment funds has stabilized. The authorities explained that the
37.
systemic impact of the decline in the value of these funds has been limited and no central
bank support was needed to help banks sustain their investment funds (except for the
temporary relaxation of the funds’ borrowing ceilings). Although sovereign bond prices
stabilized, allowing funds to begin repaying bank loans, the increased bank exposure to
sovereign risk and to the funds is a source of concern. The staff urged the authorities to
encourage banks to build up buffers to absorb losses from changes in sovereign prices, and to
strictly enforce mark-to-market valuation of bond holdings. The staff also recommended to
reverse, as soon as possible, the relaxation of funds’ borrowing ceilings to ensure rapid
repayment of bank loans and to strengthen the firewall between banks and their funds. The
authorities agreed on the need to make sure that investment funds transparently advertise the
nature of their risks.
D. Trade and Competitiveness

38.
The staff welcomed the successful negotiation of CAFTA and a free-trade
agreement with CARICOM. These agreements will further deepen the openness that has
served Costa Rica well and provide new impetus to growth. The average tariff (now
5.2 percent) will be reduced further, although a few agricultural products will continue to
carry high tariffs (albeit lower than current levels of up to 150 percent).18 With the exception
18

Costa Rica has a rating of four on the Fund’s trade restrictiveness index (scale of ten, with
one for most open). Goods imported from the United States, which currently face the mostfavored-nation tariff of 5.8 percent, would face a tariff of 3.5 percent the first year of CAFTA
(2.2 percent by the fifth year).

- 20 -

of a minority party and some labor unions, there is broad support for these agreements, and
the authorities expect them to come into effect by early 2005, following approval by the
respective national legislatures.19 Given the already low tariff rates, they will have only small
fiscal costs.20
The authorities are fully aware of the need for continued reforms to bolster
39.
competitiveness in the period ahead. They viewed the recent real depreciation of the colón,
flexible labor market legislation, especially in the areas of hiring and firing, a well-educated
work force, and social peace as major assets in the global competition for jobs and
investment.21 However, they agreed with the staff on the need for continuous improvements
in the investment climate, containing the relatively high cost of doing business in Costa Rica,
elimination of state monopolies, and upgrades in infrastructure. The authorities are seeking
support from the IDB and the World Bank for these efforts and taking steps to facilitate the
adjustment of sectors affected by CAFTA.22
IV. OTHER ISSUES

40.
Costa Rica’s economic statistics are adequate for surveillance purposes,
although there is room for improvement in some areas. The authorities explained that
major progress has been made in improving economic statistics, noting that Costa Rica joined
the SDDS in 2001 and is publishing comprehensive economic information on the internet.
They also noted that, following a 2002 ruling by the constitutional court, the government has
published all reports on Costa Rica prepared by international financial institutions. At the
same time, they expressed their intention to address the main remaining deficiencies in areas
such as government financing and public debt.
The authorities remain committed to providing debt relief consistent with the
41.
enhanced HIPC initiative. The authorities have been in touch with the Paris Club and Fund
staff to explore the various modalities to provide the debt relief and expect to submit related
proposals to congress shortly.
19

The timing of legislative approval in Costa Rica may also be influenced by the timing of
legislative approval of the agreement in the other Central American countries.

20

Staff estimates put the fiscal cost at around 0.2 percent of GDP in 2005 (nil onwards), in
line with the 0.1–0.3 percent estimated by the United Nations Economic Commission for
Latin America.
21

According to the World Bank’s 2003 World Development Indicators, Costa Rica’s labor
laws are more flexible than those in Panama and El Salvador.
22

In FY05 the World Bank will implement an Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) that
will formulate policy recommendations in this area.

- 21 -

V. STAFF APPRAISAL

42.
Costa Rica’s economic situation has improved since last year’s Article IV
consultation. Growth recovered in 2003; international reserves have increased; and the fiscal
deficit has narrowed owing to temporary tax measures and tight expenditure control.
Inflation, anchored by the crawling peg regime, remains at a relatively high rate of around
10 percent a year.
Despite these improvements, the economy continues to face significant
43.
vulnerabilities. The fiscal deficit and public debt are still high, the external current deficit
remains large, the financial system suffers from growing dollarization and prudential
weaknesses; and international reserves should be strengthened given the currency peg and the
banking system’s dollar liabilities. Recent events in investment funds highlight potential
vulnerability in the financial sector.
An agenda of comprehensive and well-sequenced reforms is needed to address
44.
these vulnerabilities and allow Costa Rica to benefit fully from its growing integration
with the global economy. The staff welcomes several important initiatives planned by the
authorities. In particular, it looks forward to early approval of the tax reform currently before
congress, as well as of CAFTA and associated structural reforms. Implementation of these
initiatives is critical to the outlook for continued growth and fiscal sustainability, and the staff
welcomes the broad domestic consensus that appears to support them.
However, these reforms by themselves would only make a limited improvement
45.
to the outlook. To ensure a sustained increase of growth and more robust public debt
dynamics, the staff recommends adoption of additional reforms with focus on tax
administration, government spending, state enterprises, monetary management, and the
financial sector.
The authorities’ medium-term fiscal program should aim at raising the primary
46.
surplus of the consolidated public sector to about 3½ percent of GDP. To this end, the
tax reform needs to be supported by a strengthening of tax administration; expenditure
reforms should include pension reform, rolling back earmarking of tax revenues, and further
strengthening wage policy in the public sector; and the performance of public enterprises
needs to improve.
The staff urges early implementation of the plan to recapitalize the central bank
47.
and shift its quasi-fiscal losses to the budget. This initiative is essential for strengthening
monetary policy and sustained disinflation, which in turn is key to reverse the trend of rising
dollarization and restore confidence in the domestic currency.
The staff supports the authorities’ plans to strengthen debt management. Fiscal
48.
consolidation will provide the scope for lengthening debt maturities, reducing reliance on
foreign-currency instruments, and developing a market for colón instruments.

- 22 -

49.
Monetary policy should be geared toward a lasting reduction of inflation. Over
the medium term, the staff recommends that the central bank move toward inflation targeting,
with a flexible exchange rate regime. In this context, the staff welcomes the authorities’
intentions to further strengthen the central bank’s inflation forecasting capabilities, monetary
instruments, and the analysis of monetary transmission channels. Greater exchange rate
flexibility will reduce the economy’s vulnerability to shocks, support de-dollarization, and
facilitate adjustment to structural change. The staff notes that the move toward greater
flexibility would need to be gradual and well supported by progress on other fronts, including
fiscal consolidation, strengthening the central bank, reducing dollar exposures of the private
sector, and strengthening the international reserve position.
While financial sector reforms have made progress in recent years, further
50.
efforts are needed. The staff supports the authorities’ intention to focus in the near term on
the key outstanding reform priorities identified in the 2001 FSAP. However, they should not
lose sight of the need for a comprehensive reform effort to strengthen the prudential and
supervisory system. In particular, the staff urges steps to level the playing field between,
respectively, public and private banks, and onshore and offshore banks; ensure consolidated
supervision of financial holdings; strengthen the system of sanctions for noncompliance; and
upgrade the bank resolution framework. The staff also strongly recommends that no further
forbearance be granted on capital requirements, and encourages the authorities to strengthen
liquidity and risk management and enhance the capabilities of the superintendency of banks.
The stabilization of investment funds in recent weeks is welcome, and the authorities need to
take steps to reverse the increased exposure of banks to investment funds and ensure a solid
firewall between banks and their funds. The authorities also need to make sure the funds
operate in line with relevant norms and transparency standards.
Reversing the trend of rising financial dollarization will require a
51.
comprehensive and sustained effort to restore the colón’s ability to compete against the
dollar. While this will take time, the staff agrees with the authorities that reducing
dollarization is critical to the crisis-proofing of the economy and will require a sustained
strengthening of macroeconomic policies and the prudential framework, especially with a
view to internalizing fully the risks of dollar intermediation.
The staff welcomes the successful negotiation of trade agreements with the
52.
United States (CAFTA) and Caribbean countries (CARICOM). In addition to the greater
trade opportunities offered by these agreements, CAFTA also provides for a broader
participation of the private sector in telecommunications and insurance.
The staff encourages the authorities to work toward completing the process of
53.
providing debt relief to Nicaragua and Honduras, consistent with the enhanced HIPC
initiative.

54.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Costa Rica be held
on the standard 12-month cycle.

Proposals made in the mid-1990s opposed by
public banks and civil society.
Slow pace of implementation because of limited
capabilities
Lack of cooperation from banks

Opposed by the third largest political party for
ideological reasons. However, votes from the two
main parties should be sufficient for approval.

Concerns about fiscal impact. Proposals for tighter
government control have been resisted by
management, labor unions, and public opinion for
years.

Status

Low. A proposal is under consideration, not requiring
congressional approval, but political support is tenuous and
authorities may delay their implementation.

Medium. The authorities are already doing it partially, but a
court ruling may force them to reinstate it. In this case, the
authorities may revive legislation in congress suspending
earmarking. However, approval may be difficult.

Low. The authorities feel that this is not a problem, as recent
increases in the wage bill are mainly the result of the reform of
the education sector and the judiciary. Wage indexation has
already been brought under control according to the authorities.

Low. No specific proposal is currently under consideration to
be presented to Congress in the immediate future.

Low. Not a top priority for the authorities. They share staff
concerns about rising pension costs, but feel political feasibility
is limited.

High. Approval likely as these actions are linked to CAFTA.

Medium. The authorities indicated that proposal will be
presented to congress following approval of tax reform.
However, passage will probably take time.

High. But most likely process will not be completed before mid2005.

High. Will be submitted to Congress in the coming months.
Approval is likely in early 2005 given widespread political
support.

High. Authorities indicated that a program proposed by FAD
will begin to be implemented soon.

High. Authorities and political parties understand that this is a
critical priority. Approval expected by July 2004.

High. The authorities are negotiating an IDB loan
to assist them in their efforts.

Low. The authorities disagree on the need for this as they
believe the crawling peg has served the country well. However,
the authorities agree on the importance of ensuring that the preconditions for a smooth transition to a more flexible exchange
rate regime are put in place.

Low. Current proposal has been in Congress since 2001 and no
progress has been made.

Medium. The authorities will consider steps to foster the
development of mechanisms to deal with exchange rate
volatility. But this is not a priority for them.

High. The authorities have already began to implement the
recommendations of a MFD-TA mission to make monetary
policy more forward looking, improve their understanding of
monetary transmission mechanisms, and strengthen policy
instruments.

Low. The authorities will consider this legislation in the
coming months, but they have no immediate plans to
implement it. However, the authorities are already encouraging
the use of CPI indexed securities.

Medium. There is no political support for the comprehensive
reforms proposed by the 2001 FSAP. A narrower proposal with
most urgent actions may be presented to congress by the end of
the year focusing on consolidated supervision of financial
holdings, increases in sanctions, and a strengthening of bank
resolution framework.

High. A law has been presented to Congress to strengthen the
operations of ICE. New procedures are being put in place to
ensure public enterprises' financing is consistent with overall
fiscal goals.

Low. A proposal now in congress will actually increase fiscal
cost and the authorities intend to oppose its approval. The
authorities are concerned about the fiscal cost of these regimes,
but this is a very sensitive topic politically, due to special
interest groups and their support in congress.

APPENDIX I

COSTA RICA—PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
I. BACKGROUND
Costa Rica’s public sector debt has increased significantly over the past five years.1 By
end-2003, public debt reached 55 percent of GDP, from 46 percent in 1999. The maturity debt
structure and its currency composition deteriorated, as efforts were made to limit the financing
cost. Reliance on short-term debt and the use of foreign-currency debt in the domestic market
intensified.

In a context of sluggish growth, the primary surpluses were insufficient to compensate
for a high interest burden, resulting in a rising debt ratio. Despite the decline in real
interest rates, the average interest payment amounted to nearly 3½ percent of GDP per year
during this period. The heavy burden of real interest payments more than offset the public
sector primary surplus (almost ½ percent of GDP per year) and the effect of sluggish growth.

Public sector debt consolidates the debt of the central government, agencies, public sector
enterprises, and the central bank. It excludes operational leases with private
telecommunications companies arranged by the state-owned electricity and
telecommunications company (ICE) for about 2 percent of GDP. These contingent
government liabilities are unlikely to be realized considering Costa Rica’s strong institutional
framework and the expected high rate of return of the investment projects.

APPENDIX I

II. BASELINE SCENARIO
The staff baseline scenario projects public debt to decline only slightly to about
50 percent of GDP by 2008. This scenario is based on:
•

Primary surplus rising to 2 percent by 2006, reflecting the approval of tax reform (with
an annual yield of 2 percent of GDP) and substantial strengthening of tax
administration.

•

Growth of 3 percent per year, based on CAFTA and tax reform approval, but with no
other structural reforms put in place.

•

An average real interest rate of about 1½–2 percent, compared to minus 1½ percent
during most of the 1990s.

•

A constant real exchange rate vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, which has a dampening effect
on the debt ratio proportional to the rate of U.S. inflation.

•

An NIR coverage of two months of imports (40 percent of gross financing needs of the
public sector).

Public finances would remain highly vulnerable to shocks. The debt ratio would still
remain high, with gross financing needs of the public sector ranging between 18–20 percent of
GDP (US$3.5–4 billion) per year during the projection period. The assumed persistently large
share of foreign-currency debt and short-term maturities would leave the public finances
vulnerable to changes in the exchange rate, interest rates, and availability of financing to the
public sector.
Standard sensitivity tests highlight the vulnerability associated with the public debt.
Stress tests show that the debt dynamics are highly sensitive to output growth volatility. Using
2003 as a starting point and two-standard deviation shocks for 2004–05, lower GDP growth
would increase the debt ratio by 16 percentage points of GDP by 2008, compared to the
baseline. Similarly, higher interest rates or a lower primary surplus would each add some 6
percentage points of GDP to the debt ratio by 2008. Moreover, a 30 percent real depreciation
would increase the debt ratio by 15 percentage points of GDP by 2008 relative to the baseline
projection.

Shocks to baseline:
(Two-standard deviations from historical levels in 2004-05 for output growth, interest
rate, and primary balance)
1. Real GDP contracts by 1.2 percent versus 3.6 percent increase in baseline.
2. Real interest rate increases to 7.4 percent from 2.1 percent in baseline.
3. The primary balance declines to a 2 percent of GDP deficit versus 0.5 percent surplus
in baseline.
4. One-time real exchange rate depreciation of 30 percent in 2004.

Alternative scenarios suggest that with the right policies, the fiscal vulnerabilities could
be reduced sharply.
•

Active Scenario. A stronger fiscal adjustment effort and the full implementation of the
measures in Table 14 would drastically improve the growth outlook and the debt
dynamics. A quick rebound in growth to

indicators as it would signal political
incapacity to reverse the ongoing fiscal
deterioration. Investment and productivity would slow causing real GDP growth to
decelerate to 1½ percent by 2008. Sagging fiscal revenues as a consequence of poor
growth and limited political room for cutting expenditures would result in a zero
primary balance. The public debt ratio would therefore increase steadily to over
62 percent of GDP by 2008.

VII. Exchange Rate Arrangements: Costa Rica’s current exchange arrangement is a
crawling peg. The central bank adjusts the exchange rate daily on the basis of the differential
between (past) inflation in Costa Rica and its main trading partners. The central bank has also
used foreign exchange intervention to help maintain the crawling peg. Costa Rica has
accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement and
maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions. Buying and selling exchange rates were
432.60 colones per U.S. dollar and 433.89 colones per U.S. dollar, respectively, as of May 24,
2004.

II. RECENT WORLD BANK ACTIVITIES

Current Portfolio: the Bank’s portfolio in Costa Rica consists of two active IBRD projects (for
a total of US$49.6 million) and two Global Environmental Facility (GEF) grants (for a total of
US$15 million). Combined, all four projects have US$48 million undisbursed. The
Ecomarkets Project and the Health Sector Strengthening and Modernization Project will be
active until 2006. In addition, the Biodiversity Grant will be active until 2005 and the
Ecomarkets Grant until 2006.
The last Bank study on Costa Rica was the “Costa Rica Social Spending and the Poor.” The
report includes a poverty profile and identifies the main vulnerable groups in the country. It
also contains a summary of the social sector expenditure review, which identifies the main
efficiency and targeting opportunities to improve the effectiveness of social spending in
reducing poverty.
Bank’s Future Assistance: Costa Rican authorities have expressed concern about the country’s
economic prospects and have requested additional Bank involvement. In recent years, Costa
Rica did not borrow from the Bank and the program of economic and sector work was
drastically reduced. The Bank has a strong opportunity for reactivating its relationship with
Costa Rica, returning to more normal assistance levels. To that purpose, the Bank finalized the
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the 2004–07 period, which was approved by the Board
on May 18, 2004.
The Bank’s CAS intends to play a supporting role of the government’s own development
program as requested by the government. The Bank considers that Costa Rica is one of the
best performers in areas which are very dear to the Bank’s mission, such as poverty reduction,
governance, and environmental sustainability. Taking into account the government’s request,
the bank’s lending strategy will be to give assistance in the areas of infrastructure, education,
agriculture, and technology and innovation

IV. RECENT ACTIVITIES

The Strategy Paper, or EBP (IDB Country Strategy), of the Inter-American Development Bank
with Costa Rica was approved June 25, 2003. The strategy of the bank is to support the
government’s development plan whose long-term goal is poverty reduction. The short- and
medium-term objective of the EBP is to accelerate economic growth via private sector
participation as a necessary condition to reduce poverty. A market-friendly environment that
promotes private initiative and competitiveness should make such goals possible. The pillars of
the desired market-friendly environment are: (i) macroeconomic consolidation through reduction
of fiscal deficit and rationalization of public sector expenditures, and (ii) the integration of the
economy to the region and the world. There are synergies between both areas which should
benefit economic growth and macroeconomic stability, allowing the country to develop and
reducing the incidence of poverty. The Hybrid Program is under preparation expecting to be
approved by the Inter-American Development Bank Board by August, 2004.
V. FUTURE PLANS

Besides the expected approval of the Hybrid Program, there are three projects in the 2004
pipeline. One is the Cuenca Binacional del Rio Sixaola for US$9 million, the second one is an
Ecotourism in Protected Areas for US$20 million, and the third is Sustainable Development in
the Region Huetar-Vertiente Atlántica for US$16 million.

inflation rate rose to 11½ percent in May
due to higher oil prices; core inflation has
remained under 10 percent. At end-May, the central bank raised its policy interest rate by
57 basis points, to 12.25 percent.

The tax reform bill continues to make progress in the National Assembly and is
now anticipated to be approved by end-August. The fiscal commission in congress is
expected to conclude its discussions of the reform in the coming two weeks. So far, no
changes have been introduced and the reform is still expected to yield 2 percent of GDP on
an annual basis. To offset any potential delay of the reform beyond August, the authorities
have announced contingent expenditure
cuts of up to 1 percent of GDP.

prices have rebounded slightly after a
sizable drop in April–May. The rebound
reflects the overall narrowing emerging

funds has now stabilized at around US$1.5 billion, from about US$3 billion in early 2004.
The decline in the funds’ value reflects both a price effect (investments are marked-tomarket) and the redemption from the funds. While outflows have halted, there are continuing
risks associated with further increases in U.S. interest rates.
6.
It appears that most of the outflows from the funds were deposited at domestic
commercial banks (deposits increased by over US$700 million in March–May). As noted in
the staff report, banks used the resources partly to buy government bonds (banks’ bond
holdings increased by around 30 percent since end-2003), and partly to on-lend to the
investment funds, taking advantage of a temporary increase in the leverage ceilings for such
funds. The funds’ borrowing increased by US$85 million in March–April, but most of this
has been already repaid.
7.
Monetary stability has been maintained through this episode. The recycling of
liquidity minimized the need for central bank intervention to stem a wider collapse of funds
(which are managed mainly by banks) and/or a sharp fall in bond prices. Action by the
central bank has been limited to small repurchases of bonds (about US$50 million) to help
stabilize their prices. Net international reserves have remained stable at US$1.5 billion.
8.
The authorities are taking measures to ensure appropriate prudential
safeguards against the risks associated with investment funds. Preliminary estimates put
the losses arising from lower bond prices at about 1 percent of risk-weighted assets
(2 percent for public banks).While the weakening of profitability might complicate some
banks’ recapitalization plans, the authorities have instructed them to keep those plans on
track; the largest public bank has already announced asset liquidations and expenditure cuts
to meet its recapitalization goals. The authorities have also issued guidelines to keep
investors appropriately informed about the nature of risks associated with investment funds.

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Costa Rica
On July 2, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Costa Rica.1
Background
Economic performance improved in 2003. Following several years of slow growth, real GDP
rose by 5½ percent, boosted by a recovery of exports and strong private investment. Inflation
declined below 10 percent, while unemployment fell to 6 percent. The external current
account deficit narrowed to 5.3 percent of GDP in 2003 from 5.7 percent of GDP in 2002.
Strong export growth, particularly electronics, largely offset higher imports of oil and capital
goods. Gross reserves rose to 2½ months of imports, owing to pre-financing of 2004 fiscal
needs and short-term capital inflows.
The public sector deficit was reduced to 5.2 percent of GDP in 2003 from 5.7 percent in
2002, owing to temporary tax measures and expenditure restraint. The primary balance
shifted to a surplus of 0.3 percent of GDP, from a deficit of ½ percent of GDP in 2002.
However, the public debt continued to rise, reaching 55 percent of GDP by the end of the
year.
Monetary policy continued to be heavily constrained by the large quasi-fiscal deficit of the
central bank. Broad money rose by 13.6 percent in 2003, reflecting large inflows of private
capital, and credit to the private sector increased by about 20 percent in nominal terms.
Financial dollarization continued to deepen and, by end-2003, about 60 percent of private

Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of the Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country’s authorities and this PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board.

-2sector credit was denominated in foreign currency. Some progress was made in
implementing the banking reform recommendations of the 2001 Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP), but many reforms remain pending, including to level the
playing field between onshore and offshore, as well as public and private banks.
Real GDP is expected to expand by 4 percent in 2004, and while inflation has risen to
11 percent recently owing to higher oil prices, core inflation remains stable at around
10 percent, broadly in line with the rate of crawl. The fiscal deficit is projected to remain at
about 5.3 percent of GDP in 2004, as a comprehensive tax reform currently before Congress
is expected to compensate for the temporary revenue measures that expired at end-2003.
The successful conclusion in early 2004 of negotiations for a trade agreement with the United
States (CAFTA) will make permanent the preferential access to the U.S. market hitherto
granted under the Caribbean Basin Initiative.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the improvement in Costa Rica’s economic situation since the
last Article IV consultation, and commended the country’s long-standing democratic tradition,
solid institutions, and strong record of social development. They noted the favorable
medium-term outlook, which should provide a good environment to make rapid progress on
structural reforms. At the same time, Directors observed that significant vulnerabilities
remain. Fiscal and external current account deficits continue to be large, the public debt has
risen to 55 percent of GDP, the banking system suffers from growing dollarization and other
weaknesses, and international reserves should be strengthened given the currency peg and
the banking system’s dollar liabilities.
Against this background, Directors endorsed several important reforms launched by the
authorities, including a tax reform and trade agreements with the United States and
CARICOM, and they were encouraged by the broad-based political support that these
reforms are receiving. However, Directors called for a more comprehensive agenda of
well-sequenced reforms to address remaining vulnerabilities, with special focus on tax
administration, government spending, state enterprises, monetary management, and the
prudential regulation and supervision of the financial sector. In light of the consensus-based
character of the political system in Costa Rica, Directors emphasized that greater attention
should be directed toward building the necessary political support for the reform agenda.
Directors stressed that strengthening the fiscal position is crucial for medium-term fiscal
sustainability. They supported the authorities’ efforts to obtain prompt legislative approval of
the proposed tax reform, and stressed the need to underpin this reform with measures to
strengthen tax administration. Directors also urged expenditure reform as a key priority, in
particular by rolling back tax revenue earmarking, strengthening the finances of the pension
system, keeping the wage bill under control, and improving the performance of the public
enterprises.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ plans to strengthen debt management, and agreed that
fiscal consolidation would make an important contribution in this regard. They supported

-3efforts to lengthen debt maturities and to develop the market for colón instruments in order to
reduce the need for foreign-currency instruments.
Directors endorsed the authorities’ intention to focus monetary policy on the objective of
reducing inflation, and encouraged them to create the conditions for an eventual shift toward
inflation targeting. They welcomed the authorities’ plans to strengthen monetary
management and instruments, make monetary policy more forward looking, and strengthen
the analysis of monetary transmission channels. Directors also supported the planned
recapitalization of the central bank. They noted that shifting the central bank’s quasi-fiscal
deficit to the government will improve fiscal transparency, as well as strengthen monetary
policy and efforts to reduce inflation, provided that overall public borrowing declines.
Some Directors considered that greater exchange rate flexibility could help reduce the
economy’s vulnerability to external shocks and facilitate adjustment to structural change.
Directors noted that a move toward more flexibility should be well sequenced and supported
by fiscal and financial reforms, and by the development of exchange market infrastructure.
Directors urged further progress toward strengthening the financial sector. They welcomed
the steps taken so far to implement the recommendations of the 2001 Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) report and follow-up technical assistance missions.
However, Directors stressed that additional efforts are needed to strengthen the prudential
and supervisory system. In particular, they stressed the need to ensure equal treatment of
public and private banks and of offshore and onshore banks, implement consolidated
supervision, strengthen sanctions and the bank resolution framework, and upgrade liquidity
and risk management. They recommended the centralization of credit risk data for banks.
The authorities also need to make sure that the investment funds market operates in
accordance with relevant norms and transparency standards. Directors noted the authorities’
efforts to further improve the already strong framework for combating money laundering and
terrorism financing in a regional context.
Directors considered the rising trend of dollarization to be a significant vulnerability.
They agreed that, to halt and reverse this trend, a broad strategy centered on reinforcing
confidence in the colón and the onshore banking system as well as ensuring that the risks of
dollar intermediation are fully internalized would be required.
Directors welcomed the progress made by Costa Rica in opening new markets for its
exports. They commended the successful completion of negotiations on the Central
American Free Trade Agreement with the United States, and supported the authorities’
efforts to secure its early congressional approval. Directors pointed to the positive impact this
agreement would have on export growth, foreign direct investment, and economic growth,
and urged early approval of the associated structural reforms.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or countries)
concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with member
countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex
post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after
Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in
a particular case.

Statement by Luis Martí, Executive Director for Costa Rica
and Roberto Simán, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
July 2, 2004
Our Costa Rican authorities would like to convey their appreciation to staff for the
constructive discussions, valuable policy advice and support received during the Article IV
consultation. The staff report and selected issues papers recognize the significant
accomplishments since the last review and, at the same time, identifies the vulnerabilities
faced by the Costa Rican economy.
Presently, there is no Fund program for Costa Rica. The last Stand-By arrangements were
approved in 1993 and 1995 as precautionary support and were never drawn down.
Recent developments
Costa Rica has been able to advance in many areas during the last year. Its social indicators
continue to be at the forefront in the Latin American region and growth in 2003 rebounded to
5.6 percent, led by private investment and exports. The fiscal deficit was narrowed because
of the temporary tax measures and the authorities implemented a number of control measures
for central government spending. The balance of payments strengthened and the country
successfully negotiated a free-trade agreement with the United States and the other Central
American countries (CAFTA). In addition to securing a more stable market, CAFTA is
expected to be one of the main engines of growth and it should help to continue carrying on
several of the pending structural reforms. It should also enhance its investment climate and
provide for the gradual opening in telecommunications and of the state monopoly in
insurance to private investors.
Despite these improvements, Costa Rica’s economy still faces a number of challenges. The
external current deficit remains large, the fiscal deficit and public debt, even though at
manageable levels, are still high, and the banking system experiences growing financial
dollarization.
A big effort in the fiscal front
Fiscal consolidation remains a central priority. The Costa Rican authorities are aware that
significant improvements in public finances are still needed in order to ensure fiscal and debt
sustainability. They have placed enhanced efforts in tax administration, expenditure reforms
and especially in the comprehensive fiscal reform package that is expected to be approved by
Congress in August 2004.
This tax reform should provide the government with a tax system that will not only increase
revenues from a broadening of the tax base by approximate 2.5 percent of the GDP, but will
also eliminate the distortions created by multiple taxes. Authorities also believe that tax
administration needs to be strengthened and they plan to implement the recommendations of

-2-

a recent FAD mission to reduce tax evasion, as soon as the tax reform is approved. The
proposed administrative measures include a plan to tighten control of large taxpayers,
eliminate cross crediting between taxes, limit tax withholdings and strengthen the tax agency.
Monetary issues
Costa Rican authorities are committed to a sound monetary policy and to an enduring
reduction of inflation. There are several factors that, combined, have caused a large negative
net worth at the Banco Central de Costa Rica (BCCR). For many years, the quasi-fiscal
losses have complicated the management of monetary policy. The large losses have inhibited
a reduction in inflation to a low single digit and account –to a considerable extent- for the
inflationary pressures. The figures involved are substantial and make up about one third of
the base money.
Both the BCCR and the Ministry of Finance have taken the initiative to go forward and are in
full agreement with the need to recapitalize the BCCR by transferring all of its quasi-fiscal
losses to the budget. As a first step, the process to recapitalize U.S. $ 250 million in 2004 is
already underway. The authorities intend now to propose to Congress a draft bill for a one–
time lump sum recapitalization for the remaining BCCR liabilities, after obtaining approval
of the tax reform currently before Congress. The assumption by the government of the BCCR
liabilities will definitely enhance the BCCR’s capacity to implement monetary policy.
As proven by the recent fluctuations in the funds managed by local banks, the financial
system has weathered well the shift of investors towards liquidity following the slump in
value of domestic investment funds. We commend the staff for a clear and concise
explanation of developments. It is important to underline here that there were no factors of
confidence or surveillance involved, but the shift was due to an asset price correction
triggered by the rise in long-term rates in the U.S. The authorities have reacted in accordance
with observed practice elsewhere, first providing liquidity to the system in order to
strengthen the ability of financial institutions to redeem participations, and later watching
very closely the level of liquidity in order to keep monetary magnitudes under control and
prevent an inflationary fallout.
Crawling peg: an anchor for confidence
Costa Rica has followed a somewhat flexible exchange rate crawl since the early 80s, with
periodic adjustments to compensate for inflation differentials between the country and its
main trading partners. Over the years, the exchange rate regime has enabled the authorities to
avoid deviations in the REER as well as currency crises, and has presided over a remarkable
period of opening of the national economy. It enjoys considerable credibility and is not
something that the economic agents in Costa Rica see as an immediate problem. This being
said, the authorities are open to considering other exchange rate options especially once the
negative net worth of the Central Bank has been addressed and, as a result, inflation has been
significantly curbed. As the staff notes, the move towards greater flexibility would need to be

-3-

gradual, i.e., because of the necessity to develop a solid market infrastructure for price
formation.
The challenge of halting financial dollarization
A high degree of financial dollarization in the economy is a source of vulnerability and our
authorities are fully aware of the need to reverse the current trend. Dollarization in Costa
Rica can probably be related to inflationary expectations, but is also a side effect of the
increased participation of the external sector in the Costa Rican economy, where imports and
exports of goods and services denominated in U.S. dollars in 2003 represented approximately
94 percent of GDP.
The challenge is to reduce financial dollarization by strengthening the macroeconomic
framework through the proposed fiscal consolidation, reduction in inflation and other
measures recommended by the recent MFD mission, which will give market players
confidence in sustained monetary stability. Authorities are strengthening the prudential
framework to ensure full internalization of the dollar-intermediation risks and are also
encouraging banks to promote price-index instruments to help promote colón intermediation.
A final word
Costa Rica is in many respects a success story. A stable democracy since 1949, Costa Rica
domestic politics have developed a very distinctive feature: it has long placed a high
premium on achieving wide socio-political consensus on all major policy issues. The
downside to this emphasis on consensus is, of course, that important legislative or executive
decisions often take quite long until they effectively materialize. On the other hand, reforms
are sustainable when they grow out of the widespread support of society, and the Costa Rican
society takes it for granted that the domestic political process is conditioned by the objective
of building consensus around all important issues. The authorities are now engaged in one of
these exercises in order to secure safe passage of the fiscal reform, and will soon be trying to
muster the necessary support for recapitalizing the BCCR.
Costa Rica, which promoted years ago an effective welfare system, has combined reasonable
economic progress with large investments in human capital and an explicit concern about
environmental constraints. Its social indicators are often close to those prevailing in
developed economies, and it is noteworthy that the World Bank underscores the relevance of
“knowledge sharing” in its current relationship with Costa Rica, especially in those areas
such as poverty alleviation and environmental management, where the country has been
particularly successful.
Our authorities highly value the continued policy dialogue with the Fund. They see the Fund
and other multilateral institutions as key partners in discussing their priorities and in the
implementation of their plans to ensure sustainable growth, capitalize on its remarkable
record of social progress and take full advantage of the benefits of its integration to the global
economy.
