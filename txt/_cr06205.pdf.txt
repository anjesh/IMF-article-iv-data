INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2005 Consultation
with St. Vincent and the Grenadines
Approved by Ratna Sahay and Matthew Fisher
June 23, 2005
Economic Background: St. Vincent and the Grenadines is a 32-island economy in the eastern Caribbean, with
a population of about 106,300 and per capita GDP of US$3,800. It is one of eight eastern Caribbean countries
and territories comprising the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU), and its GDP accounts for 13 percent
of the combined ECCU GDP. The ECCU has a common central bank, the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank
(ECCB), and a common currency, the Eastern Caribbean (EC) dollar. The EC dollar has been pegged to the
U.S. dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar since July 1976. St. Vincent and the Grenadines has accepted
the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on
payments and transfers for current international transactions. Fund relations are summarized in Appendix I.
Political Situation: St. Vincent and the Grenadines has a unicameral parliament consisting of 21 members—15
elected and 6 appointees. Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves’ Unity Labour Party assumed power following the
March 2001 elections, in which it defeated the National Democratic Party (which had been in power since 1984)
by winning 12 out of the 15 contested seats in Parliament. Elections are due no later than March 2006, but it is
likely that elections will be held in the second half of 2005.
Previous Board Discussion: The last Article IV consultation was completed on May 5, 2004. The public
information notice (PIN), which contains the summing up of Executive Directors’ discussions and policy
recommendations, can be found at the IMF website at: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2005/pn0565.htm.
Mission: A staff mission comprising P. Cashin (Head), M. Mlachila, P. Mishra (all WHD), and
D. Nyberg (FIN) visited Kingstown during April 5–13, 2005. Staff met with the Prime Minister (and Minister of
Finance), the Director General of the Ministry of Finance, other senior government officials, representatives of
the banking, agriculture, and business sectors, as well as trade unions and civil society. Staff of the ECCB and
CDB also participated in the meetings. K. Lynch and R. Campbell (OED), and R. Sahay and D. Robinson
(WHD) joined staff for the final discussions, which also overlapped with the ECCU Regional Discussions with
St. Vincent and the Grenadines.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Rapid economic growth in the 1980s was followed by a sluggish growth performance since
the early 1990s. Growth has slowed due to the erosion of trade preferences, poor weather and
natural disasters, the September 11 shock, and a decline in overseas development assistance.
While traditionally among the most fiscally responsible of the ECCU countries, to accelerate
growth the authorities began in the late 1990s to implement expansionary fiscal policies. This
growth in public sector imbalances engendered a rise in the stock of public debt to almost
80 percent of GDP in 2004.
Economic activity in St. Vincent and the Grenadines has strengthened, with real GDP
growing by over 4 percent in 2004 and further acceleration expected in 2005. This improved
performance was underpinned by a supportive external environment in tourism, an increase in
public sector investment, and a rebound in construction and agriculture sectors. However, fiscal
imbalances expanded in 2004 and under current policies will rise further in 2005. The approved
budget for 2005 is likely to lead to a significant deterioration in the fiscal accounts if fully
implemented.
Prudential indicators point to weaknesses in the banking sector, although efforts are
ongoing to strengthen bank balance sheets. Indigenous banks suffer from a number of
weaknesses, including total capital-to-risk-weighted assets that are considerably below the ECCU
average, a large portfolio of nonperforming loans, and high public sector exposures.
The discussions focused on measures to significantly reduce poverty and bring St. Vincent
and the Grenadines’ income level closer to that of its ECCU counterparts, by enhancing
growth potential, making debt more sustainable and reducing vulnerabilities. In the absence
of a strong effort to tackle the growing fiscal imbalances, the stock of debt could be placed on an
unsustainable path. The high level of debt raises the risk from adverse shocks, constrains the
government’s future ability to engage in counter-cyclical policy, and crowds out expenditure on
the achievement of important social and economic goals.
Fiscal adjustment of 2½ percent of GDP in 2005 is needed as a first step in closing the fiscal
imbalances. This would be largely achieved by expenditure reductions, through cuts to the civil
service wage bill, transfers, and limiting capital expenditure to well-targeted projects. Over the
medium term, efforts should be made to broaden the tax base (through the introduction of a
value-added tax and market-based property taxes), reduce tax concessions, and allow domestic
retail prices for energy products to reflect world prices.
St. Vincent and the Grenadines is vulnerable to both natural disasters and adverse financial
sector shocks. To reduce weather-related vulnerabilities, the authorities should further boost
expenditure on disaster mitigation and preparedness, and their efforts to transfer disaster risk. The
prudential and regulatory framework of the financial sector has been strengthened in recent
years—further enhancements would reduce vulnerabilities in the financial sector, particularly
those facing local banks with high exposure to the public sector and a large portfolio of
nonperforming loans.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
St. Vincent and the Grenadines is a small, open economy whose mainstay is a
largely tourism-based services sector. The export-oriented services sector accounts for
about three-quarters of total value added, and the import content of both domestic
consumption and investment is high. While the traditionally-dominant agriculture sector has
declined in recent decades, agricultural crops (particularly bananas) remain important in
sustaining the incomes of the country’s large rural population.
2.
Real economic growth in the 1990s and 2000s was considerably less than that of
the 1980s. Factors inhibiting the

3.
The fiscal situation has weakened since the late 1990s, and public debt has risen
rapidly since 1999, yet remains lower than the ECCU average (Figure 1). While
traditionally among the most fiscally responsible of the ECCU countries, to accelerate
growth the authorities began in the late 1990s to implement expansionary fiscal policies. This
fiscal laxity was compounded by the cost of rehabilitation expenditures to repair damage
caused by a series of weather-induced disasters. Public debt rose from less than 50 percent of
GDP in 1997 to reach 79 percent of GDP by 2004, in large part due to the assumption by the
government in 1999 of private debt for the construction of the Ottley Hall shipyard.1
Reflecting this accretion of public liabilities, as well as a result of increasingly less

1

In 1999 the government assumed a large private external debt of EC$156 million (amounting to 17½ percent
of GDP) for the construction of Ottley Hall shipyard (a yacht repair facility). The shipyard was operated by a
joint-venture company, Caribbean Charter and Yacht Yard Holdings, owned by the government (49 percent)
and a private company, the St. Vincent Yachting and Shipping Company (51 percent). The government had
guaranteed the debt. In 2001 the government obtained a moratorium on interest payments pending a settlement
with creditors (foreign commercial banks), and continues to seek a debt restructuring. The Italian export
guarantee agency, SACE, which insured the external financiers, is currently servicing the loan.

depreciation of the U.S. dollar against major currencies since 2002 (by 18 percent in real
effective terms) has improved competitiveness in European tourism markets. Increases in
wage levels have been modest (including relative to other ECCU countries), in part due to a
civil service wage freeze during 2002 and 2003, although the number of civil servants has
increased considerably. Current account imbalances continue to be largely financed by FDI
flows.

Box 1. St. Vincent and the Grenadines: Summary of Approved 2005 Budget
The budget envisages a large increase in the budget deficit (overall balance) from 3.4 percent of
GDP in 2004 to 6½ percent of GDP in 2005. This is mainly due to a jump in expenditures of over
4½ percent of GDP to 38.3 percent of GDP, while revenues and grants are expected to increase only
modestly, by about 1 percent of GDP to 31.8 percent of GDP. The public debt-to-GDP ratio would rise
to about 84 percent of GDP.
Tax measures
Budgeted revenue measures are relatively modest in strength, yielding about 0.5–0.7 percent of
GDP. The main new tax measures are:
•

A tax on all calls made on cellular telephones at the rate of 5 percent. This is expected to yield about
0.2 percent of GDP in 2005.

•

An increase in the retail price of petroleum products: an increase in the gasoline price of 50 cents
(6.7 percent) to EC$8 per gallon; and an increase in the diesel price of 75 cents (12.5 percent) to
EC$6.75 per gallon. This will entail additional revenues amounting to about 0.2–0.4 percent of GDP
in 2005.

•

A 10 percent tax on lottery winnings in excess of EC$500. The yield for this measure is expected to
be 0.1 percent of GDP.

Expenditure measures
The government is planning to substantially increase its expenditure outlays across the board.
Current expenditures are expected to increase by 18 percent to 29.3 percent of GDP, while capital
expenditures would increase by 30 percent to 8.9 percent of GDP. Most of the envisaged increase in
current expenditures emanates from wages and salaries (1.1 percent of GDP), mainly due to an increase
in the number of civil servants, as well as a contracted salary increase of 3 percent in 2005. The main
new expenditure items include:
•

Universal secondary education: the full cost is unclear but the program is expected to entail an
additional 0.3 percent of GDP for new school facilities, and the hiring of 90 new teachers.

•

Continuation of the low-income housing project: 350 new houses are expected to be completed in
2005.

•

Construction of the Windward Highway and Cross-Country road, estimated to cost at least 0.7
percent of GDP in 2005.

•

Construction of Canouan jetport, entailing 2½ percent of GDP in additional expenditures per year
over two years.

•

Increase of 0.1 percent of GDP in subsidies to banana producers.

•

Contribution to the recapitalization of the regional airline, LIAT, costing 0.5 percent of GDP,
financed through an interest-free loan from the Government of Trinidad and Tobago.

Some progress has been made in structural reforms. The restructuring of the
banana industry has continued with European Union support, and the authorities continue in
their efforts to diversify production (under the Agricultural Diversification Program) into
non-banana agriculture. Progress has been made in raising domestic prices of energy inputs
and in tax administration, and in efforts to improve labor skills through training programs.
The authorities have restated their intention to introduce a VAT and market valuation-based
property taxation in 2007, as recommended by the OECS Tax Reform and Administration
Commission. A one-stop shop for foreign investment enquiries and facilitation has been
created with the establishment of the National Investment Promotions Incorporated (NIPI).
Efforts have also been made to monitor and reduce the operational losses of public
enterprises, through the establishment of a Monitoring Committee on Public Enterprises,
headed by the Prime Minister.
III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
A. Overview
15.
The growth potential of the economy needs to be raised and public debt reduced
to alleviate poverty and bring St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ income level closer to
that of its ECCU counterparts. Staff emphasized that the economic rebound in 2004–05
provides an opportunity to reduce St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ growing debt burden.
Reducing public debt will provide fiscal room for maneuver in the event of adverse
exogenous shocks, allow for an expansion of private sector activity, and release resources for
social sector spending. Accordingly, the discussions were organized around three key areas:
•

raising medium-term growth potential, including enhancing regional cooperation,
expanding remittance and investment flows from the large diaspora, and addressing
structural change in the economy;

- 15 -

•

ensuring debt sustainability and reinforcing fiscal policy, through a combination of
measures to foster fiscal consolidation and prioritization of the ambitious public
investment program; and

•

reducing vulnerabilities to adverse shocks, in particular, natural disasters and
potential contagion from national and regional banking crises.

16.
The authorities broadly agreed with the mission’s recommendations and its
assessment of the major issues confronting the economy. The authorities welcomed the
heightened focus during this consultation on enhancing growth, reducing vulnerabilities to
shocks, and the broader regional perspective drawn from the Fund’s ECCU Regional
Discussions. They argued that a key policy challenge was ensuring structural transformation
of the economy while at the same time controlling debt levels and the cost of debt servicing.
17.
The dialogue between Fund staff and the authorities has deepened. The
authorities considered the mission’s recommendations useful, and conveyed their particular
appreciation for the provision of detailed fiscal policy recommendations, as was provided
during the October 2004 staff visit and the Article IV consultation. The government has been
receptive to Fund advice in its budget deliberations on raising revenues, and has taken further
steps to bolster revenues in the context of the 2005 budget in line with staff
recommendations. However, the government has not been as responsive with regard to
expenditure control, as the authorities have felt that such expenditures are justified to address
considerable infrastructure weaknesses and to meet important social goals, such as poverty
reduction and universal secondary education. CARTAC’s technical assistance continues to
be used effectively in improving national accounts compilation, taxation administration, and
offshore banking supervision.
B. Enhancing Growth Potential and Alleviating Poverty
18.
The transition of the economy from agriculture toward more valued-added
services will raise the economy’s growth potential and assist in poverty reduction.
Achieving success with this strategy will require reforms across a broad spectrum. In the
absence of such reforms, growth can be expected to stagnate at about 2½ percent per year,
given the growing debt burden and accompanying fiscal drag. While economic growth in
St. Vincent and the Grenadines has slowed significantly since the late 1980s, near-term
growth prospects appear quite strong—trend growth under the active scenario is assumed to
be about 4 percent per year. For their part, the authorities considered the staff’s view of
medium-term growth prospects overly cautious—they argued that growth could average
about 5–6 percent per year, given success in the economy’s transition into tourism and

- 16 -

diversification of its agriculture sector.4 The mission recommended that reforms to enhance
growth potential should focus on:
•

Enhancing valued added from tourism. The tourism sector is the dominant source of
foreign exchange and employment in the country, with services constituting about
73 percent of GDP in 2004. Staff encouraged the authorities to examine the extent to
which vertical diversification (into niche tourism markets), market diversification
(tapping nontraditional tourism-customer markets), and enhancing linkages between
the local agriculture and tourism (with the former dominated by the low-income, rural
component of the labor force) can boost value added from the tourism sector. While
concurring with the mission, the authorities expressed the view that in order to
significantly boost the long-term potential for tourism, there is need to enhance air
transport linkages and infrastructure.5 It is in this light that the authorities argued that
it is necessary to build the Canouan Island jetport (at a cost of at least US$20
million).

•

Strengthening the investment climate. Staff argued that there is need to further
improve the investment climate, but that increasing tax concessions is not an optimal
strategy. In common with most OECS countries, extensive concessions have been
granted to stimulate investment and promote job creation. However, discretionary
concessions severely distort competition between enterprises. The mission welcomed
the creation of National Investment Promotions Inc., with the goal of streamlining
bureaucracy and reducing

educated6. This large-scale emigration has produced a steady flow of remittances
from Vincentians abroad. The authorities and the staff agreed that greater use could
be made of the country’s large diaspora to build networks for trade, investment
promotion and tourism, in order to reduce the net costs of emigration (given the
provision of free primary and secondary education).
•

Regional integration and cooperation. The small size of local markets often
precludes industries in ECCU countries from achieving economies of scale.
Moreover, there is much less intra-ECCU movement of labor than of goods, services
and capital. In this connection, the mission argued that the authorities need to assess
the potential benefits from enhancing regional integration through efforts to: provide
government services collectively; attain greater flexibility in the movement of goods,
services and factors, particularly labor, across the borders of ECCU countries; and
enhance regional arrangements that would facilitate greater integration with the world
economy. The authorities stated that they were keen to participate fully in the
Caribbean Single Market and Economy (CSME), and would welcome the free
movement of labor within CSME-member countries. In this vein, they have passed
legislation to liberalize the movement of skilled persons (Skilled Nationals Act),
including by allowing national social security benefits to be carried over by OECS
nationals, and movement for business activities (National Factors Act).

that the authorities use the

enhancing social safety nets for displaced farmers and agricultural workers. To limit
the social impact of the transition, staff would support the temporary use of fiscal
measures—such as income transfers to farmers, the provision of noncontributory

Sustained economic growth is
the key to improving living standards
and alleviating poverty. In consultation
with civil society, and under the
leadership of the National Economic and
Social Development Council (NESDC), the government has been guided in its povertyreduction efforts by the home-developed Interim-Poverty Reduction Strategy (I-PRSP). The
I-PRSP identifies national priorities for poverty reduction, and will inform the allocation of
donor-provided funds designed to reduce poverty (Box 2). Staff commended the authorities
for these efforts, and for the incorporation of guidelines for economic development and
poverty reduction as part of the Social Contract with trade unions, the private sector, and
civil society.

C. Debt Sustainability and Fiscal Policy
20.
The staff recognized the authorities’ intentions to strike a balance between
providing fiscal stimulus and ensuring debt sustainability. In the recent past the
government has used its capital program as a means of stimulating economic activity at a
time of below-average national economic growth, while simultaneously seeking to control
the deterioration in the overall balance by dampening growth in current expenditure and
enhancing its revenue-raising activities. In this regard, the recently adopted Fiscal Covenant
sets out the government’s views on striking a balance between fiscal stimulus and debt
sustainability, the institutional structure of fiscal policymaking, and improvements to the
transparency and productivity of public expenditure.8 However, the mission pointed out that
this counter-cyclical fiscal stance had worsened fiscal imbalances since 2000 and fueled a

7

While the long-term trend is for rising consumption of bananas on European markets, price competition by
U.K. retailers (the dominant market for Windward Islands bananas) has seen retail banana prices fall sharply,
particularly since late 2002. This challenging market for bananas will place additional competitive pressures on
Caribbean producers, irrespective of the eventual form and level of trade preferences.

8

The Covenant has five basic components: (i) consolidating fiscal adjustment; (ii) raising the productivity of
public sector expenditure; (iii) increasing fiscal transparency; (iv) promoting social equity; and (v) promoting
the development of democratic institutions. The only specified quantitative target in the Covenant is that current
expenditure should not exceed 85 percent of current revenues.

- 19 -

rapid increase in public indebtedness, with the debt-to-GDP ratio climbing by 12 percentage
points of GDP (to 79 percent) in the period 2000−04.
21.
The mission argued that as economic growth continues to accelerate from its
recent lows, there is less need for a high level of public investment to stimulate
economic activity. Staff argued that the government should not allow an asymmetry in their
counter-cyclical fiscal policy, by failing to wind down its capital spending program as the
pace of domestic economic activity quickens.
22.
A continuation of current fiscal policies would lead to an unsustainable level of
debt, and crowd-out expenditure on the achievement of important social and economic
goals. According to staff projections, debt will decline only gradually over the medium term,
even in the presence of strong fiscal adjustment and good growth performance. Most of the
alternative scenarios and bound tests in the debt sustainability analyses show that without the
adjustment envisaged in the active scenario, debt levels would either continue to rise over
time or decline only marginally. Under current policies, the stock of debt will reach over
95 percent of GDP by the end of the decade, and likely higher if adjustment is not frontloaded. As a consequence, central government interest payments would rise to 5 percent of
GDP (one-sixth of current revenues), increasing the government’s vulnerability to debt
rollover risk and reducing its ability to undertake expenditures in achieving other important
goals, such as poverty alleviation. While not contesting staff analysis, the authorities argued
that a short-term expansion in the stock of public debt was necessary, to ensure long-term

23.
The mission argued that placing
debt on a clear downward path will
require the sustained implementation of
a strong set of policy reforms. Such a set
of reforms would involve a mixture of
growth-enhancing structural measures;
fiscal consolidation; and a reinforcement
of the authorities’ debt management
strategy. Under the active scenario,
involving additional fiscal measures
(yielding about 2½ percent of GDP in
2005) and medium-term growth rising to
about 4 percent per year, staff projections
suggest the debt stock will decline to
about 64 percent of GDP over the next six
years. The fiscal adjustment could be
achieved by: the introduction of a broadbased consumption tax and market-

Box 2. St. Vincent and the Grenadines: Poverty Indicators
and Poverty Reduction Strategy
The process of developing a poverty reduction strategy began in September 2001, under the new
government. The government assigned responsibility for the development of a Poverty Reduction Framework
to the National Economic and Social Development Council (NESDC), which comprises representatives from
the government ministries, the ECCB and other financial institutions, private sector, and civil society groups.
A Poverty Reduction Task Force was established by the NESDC to develop the Poverty Reduction Strategy.
The final revision of the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) was completed in June 2003.
Timely and comprehensive poverty data for St. Vincent and the Grenadines are fairly limited. The most
recent source of statistical data on the incidence of poverty in St. Vincent and the Grenadines is “The Poverty
Assessment Report” prepared by a group of consultants in 1996. The report states that 37½ percent of the
population (30.6 percent of households) is poor (defined as income below the locally-defined poverty line), of
which 25.7 percent of the population (20.4 percent of households) is indigent. A study prepared in 2001 on
“The Socio-Economic Impact of Restructuring the Banana Industry” indicates a worsening of the poverty
situation as a result of severe shocks to the economy since 1995.
The strategy for poverty reduction adopted by the government follows a multi-faceted approach, and
includes: (i) a job creation program (including the Youth Empowerment Service to address youth
unemployment); (ii) a low-income housing project; (iii) an enhanced safety net for the poor through public
assistance; (iv) the promotion of a micro-enterprise sector; (v) increased subsidies to banana farmers; and
(vi) large new infrastructure projects in roads, airports and power plants.
In order to promote civil society participation in national policy formulation the NESDC has developed
a “Social Contract”. The contract aims at fixing the general framework for cooperation between government
and civil society in both policy formulation and monitoring.
Data from the 2001 Population and Housing Census provides some information on living standards in
St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Census data reveals that the unemployment rate was 21.1 percent, compared
with 19.8 percent in 1991. In the 2001 Census, about 90 percent of Vincentian households owned stoves,
66 percent had refrigerators, 53 percent had a telephone, while about 15 percent owned washing machines.

Optimal debt stock and debt concessionality
24.
Preliminary calculations by staff indicate that the external public debt of
St. Vincent and the Grenadines is only marginally concessional. In the past the authorities
have argued that—using a 10 percent discount rate—their debt was highly concessional and

- 21 -

therefore nominal debt-to-GDP indicators were not particularly useful for St. Vincent and the
Grenadines. Using a 5 percent as discount rate, the debt is not highly concessional, as the
grant element is only about 7 percent.9 Accordingly, the staff pointed out that while during
the 1980s and early 1990s there may have been a large concessional component of external
borrowings, a number of changes in the structure of debt—notably the rapid accumulation of
commercial debt in the 2000s—has meant that the country’s overall debt profile is no longer
concessional.
25.
The mission commended the government for its recent efforts to develop a Debt
Strategy (as part of the Fiscal Covenant), but argued that the strategy needs to be
strengthened. The mission stated that the authorities’ medium-term public debt target of
75 percent of GDP is too high, given the growing cost of debt servicing which in 2005 will
consume 23 percent of current revenues, the declining concessionality of public borrowings,
and the high volatility of national income and export receipts. The authorities argued that this
medium-term debt target was achievable and would set a useful benchmark by which to
guide fiscal policy. The authorities also noted that an important component of the Debt
Strategy has been their continuing discussions with Ottley Hall creditors, in attempting to
reach agreement on a restructuring of obligations.
Revenue measures
26.
The scope for increasing tax rates—already high in St. Vincent and the
Grenadines—is relatively limited, but there is some room for raising revenues by
broadening the coverage of the tax system. Key aspects of this broadening of the tax base
over the medium term include:
•

Value added tax. The authorities have committed to the introduction of a VAT in
2007, and have established a VAT implementation unit. Staff urged authorities to
begin the process of introducing the VAT, since it requires a substantial preparatory
period—at least 18 months to 2 years—to successfully introduce such a tax.10

•

Property tax. The real estate sector appears to be performing well, but with little
improvement in property tax collections. The authorities have committed to the
introduction of a market valuation-based property tax in 2006–07. Staff encouraged

9

A more appropriate way to determine concessionality would be to use currency-specific commercial interest
reference rates (CIRRs). In the absence of loan-by-loan details, the discount rate of 5 percent is likely close to
the weighted average of the discount rates of the currencies in the basket of external loans held by the country
(comprising 75 percent U.S. dollar and U.S. dollar-linked loans, 8½ percent in SDRs and the remainder in other
currencies).

10

As recommended by the staff, the authorities have requested technical assistance from CARTAC in the design
and implementation of the VAT.

the government to undertake the required cadastral surveys and introduce such a
property tax system as soon as technically feasible.

concessions should be reduced,
and that the scope for concessions should be strictly limited to those in the statutes. In
view of the fact that other ECCU countries have similar concessions, the authorities
were urged to seek greater regional cooperation, in order to have a common approach
to tax concessions, and thereby avoid a “race to the bottom.” While the authorities
were in broad agreement with the mission’s recommendations to rein in concessions,
they argued that given the strong competition between Caribbean jurisdictions for
foreign investment, some level of concessions would need to remain.

•

Taxation of petroleum products. The mission noted that retail prices of petroleum
products are among the lowest in the ECCU region. Recent rises in global oil prices
have significantly dampened revenues earned from petroleum taxation. The mission
recommended that taxation of petroleum products should be improved in order to
make the yield more

change. The authorities agreed that the current regime is leading to the erosion of tax
revenues, but noted the need to move carefully in raising the retail price of petroleum.
They argued that increasing prices would adversely affect vulnerable groups, by
raising the cost of public transportation and fuel for cooking. The staff responded that
it would fully support targeted expenditure on the provision of social safety nets for
such vulnerable groups.
Expenditure measures
27.
On the expenditure side, the potential for consolidation of spending is high. The
mission argued that expenditures need to be strictly contained, and the implementation of a
number of new initiatives delayed. In particular, the staff noted that there is a clear need to
significantly scale back expenditures relative to those in the approved 2005 budget. Staff
recommended adoption of measures to yield 2½ percent of GDP in 2005. The main areas of
expenditure reduction include: maintaining wages and salaries constant in real terms
(yielding savings of 0.9 percent of GDP); maintaining transfers constant in nominal terms
(0.7 percent of GDP); lower interest payments on the smaller stock of debt (0.3 percent of
GDP); and reducing capital spending to well-targeted projects (0.7 percent of GDP).
Expenditure measures should focus on near-term rationalizations, and on a gradual
diminution of the size of the public sector. Key recommendations included:
•

11

Public sector wages and employment. Efforts should focus on increasing the costeffectiveness of service provision by raising productivity in the civil service. The
wage bill remains large

thereby providing room
for wage increases (in line with productivity) while keeping the wage bill constant.11
The authorities argued that given the multi-island composition of the country, there

was a need to replicate the provision of public services across islands, which entailed
greater numbers of civil servants.
•

Capital expenditures. The level of expenditures has gradually risen since 2001 to
over 8 percent of GDP—higher than the 1995–2000 average of 6½ percent of GDP.
Tighter control and prioritization over the execution of capital projects could generate
significant savings over the medium term. The government should give greater
emphasis not to the volume of capital expenditure, but to the efficiency of such
spending. To this end, a careful review of the contents of the PSIP to ensure that it
emphasizes projects with a high rate of return and avoids unproductive projects,
particularly those financed on nonconcessional terms, is required.

small fraction of public buildings and assets are insured. Staff also encouraged the authorities
to participate in regional initiatives (such as those of the World Bank) designed to pool
insurance risk across countries, and thereby lower the cost of catastrophic insurance.
29.
Potential vulnerabilities in the financial sector appear concentrated in the stateowned National Commercial Bank (NCB), which accounts for about one quarter of
financial system assets. As with most regional indigenous banks, the NCB is highly exposed
to the local public sector,12 and has a large (albeit declining) portfolio of nonperforming loans
(Figure 3). The NCB is currently drawing on external management expertise and technical
assistance in efforts to restructure its operations, enhance efficiencies and raise profitability.
30.
Financial soundness indicators and stress testing results suggest that locally
incorporated banks (which account for about 60 percent of total banking system assets)
are weak and vulnerable to adverse shocks that impair government obligations and
interrupt tourism.13 While locally-incorporated banks appear sufficiently capitalized (with
an 8.9 percent aggregate capital adequacy ratio at end-2004), due to the absence of riskweighting on government exposures and potential under-provisioning, local banks’ true
capital position may be lower. Foreign bank branches generally have lower rates of
nonperforming loans, and are well provisioned. Cross-border linkages are relatively low,
thereby reducing vulnerability to regional shocks—holdings of other ECCU public sector
claims and net claims on other ECCU banks amount to 3½ and 8½ percent of banks’ assets,
respectively. The ECCB’s external reserve coverage stands at 96 percent of monetary
demand liabilities, substantially in excess of the legal floor of 60 percent.14 Nonetheless, due
to the quasi-currency board arrangement, there is limited room for the ECCB to act as a
lender of last resort.
31.
Further strengthening the prudential and regulatory framework would reduce
vulnerabilities in the financial sector. The 2004 ECCU regional FSAP report identified a
number of weaknesses in the supervisory and regulatory framework for both banks and
nonbank financial institutions. Approval of the proposed amendments to the Uniform
Banking Act would be an important step in this regard, by helping to foster a strong financial
system capable of supporting growth, and address many of the weaknesses identified in the
2004 regional FSAP. While nonbank financial institutions—credit unions, the building
12

Commercial banks’ exposure to government amounts to about one-fifth of total assets (see Figure 3).

13

Exceptional but plausible stress scenarios for St. Vincent and the Grenadines include a major natural disaster
that entails significant economic losses and a sharp decline in tourism arrivals. It is assumed that such a scenario
could lead to a nonrepayment of 10 percent of banks’ government exposures and an increase of 5 percent of
total loans in loan losses. Under this scenario, all the locally-incorporated banks would be technically insolvent,
as their capital would be below the Basel prudential guidelines.

St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ (imputed) reserve coverage of short-term liabilities is high, amounting to over

society, the insurance sector, and the Development Bank—are smaller in size, staff urged the
authorities to continue to strengthen their regulatory and supervisory framework. The Report
on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) of 2004 identified a need to further
enhance the regulatory and supervisory framework for the offshore banking sector—
including the introduction of a risk-based framework for capital adequacy and
implementation of prudential requirements.15 The International Bank Act, adopted in
December 2004, strengthens the supervision of the country’s offshore sector. Operational
prudential guidelines consistent with the Basel Core Principles have been drafted, but not yet
issued.
E. Statistical Issues
32.
As the structure of the economy changes, there is a need to ensure that the
statistical database provides relevant, accurate and timely information to policymakers.
The mission encouraged the authorities to strengthen the coverage of the national accounts,
especially for the tourism and services sector. There remain substantial weaknesses in data
on the labor market, domestic and external debt, tourism arrivals and expenditure, the
nonbank financial sector, foreign project aid, and on the financial activities of the public
enterprises. Staff urge the authorities to devote more resources to collection and
dissemination of data in these areas. Staff also encourages the authorities to strengthen the
central statistical office, in particular by continuing to make recourse to technical assistance
offered through CARTAC.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
Economic prospects have brightened since the nadir of 2001, aided by sustained
activity in construction and a favorable external environment. The tourism sector has
expanded rapidly with the increase in stay-over arrivals during 2004. Prospects for further
expansion in the sector, including tourism-related services and associated construction
activity, appear strong and are likely to underpin growth for the next several years.
34.
However, the level of public debt has increased significantly over the past year.
The government borrowed heavily during the last quarter of 2004, in anticipation of
forthcoming projects. The outlook for 2005 is quite difficult as without additional
expenditure restraint the overall deficit is likely to reach 6½ percent of GDP, an
unprecedented level in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Staff therefore strongly urges the

15

St. Vincent and the Grenadines was removed from the FATF list of noncooperating territories in June 2003,
following an upgrading of its supervisory and regulatory framework. Activity in the offshore sector rebounded
strongly in 2004. As of April 2005, the St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ offshore sector comprised: seven
offshore banks, 6,328 international business companies, 129 international trusts, 12 international insurance
companies, and 26 mutual funds—all are regulated by the International Finance Service Authority.

- 27 -

government to address the weakening fiscal situation by implementing the recommended
measures to reduce the deficit.
35.
In the absence of a strong effort to tackle the growing fiscal imbalances, the cost
of debt servicing will increase, and the stock of debt could be placed on an
unsustainable path. Even with an acceleration in growth accompanied by a large and
sustained fiscal adjustment, the debt burden will shrink only gradually over the medium term.
Such a high debt level heightens the risk from adverse shocks, and acts to constrain the
government’s future ability to engage in counter-cyclical policy. Staff therefore recommends
that the government significantly strengthen its debt strategy, and pay close attention to the
level of debt (including the nominal debt-to-GDP ratio) as a useful indicator of the debt
burden, as well as address the composition of debt by reducing the share of commercial debt.
36.
Staff welcomes the government’s plans to improve tax policy and
administration, and emphasizes the need to broaden the tax base and reduce
concessions. The planned adoption of the VAT and market-based property taxation are steps
in the right direction. However, more needs to be done, particularly in the area of tax
concessions. Discretionary tax concessions should be removed, while the overall level of
statutory concessions should be reduced, and the scope for concessions should be strictly
limited to those in the statutes. Staff urges the authorities to seek greater regional
cooperation, in order to have a common approach to tax concessions, and thereby avoid a
region-wide “race to the bottom.”
37.
There is a need to control the wage bill, which has increased rapidly due to
continued recruitment despite a stagnant national population. A wide-ranging civil
service reform is urgently needed to ensure that expenditure consolidation can be achieved
without impinging on the quality of service provision. At the same time, the high level of
capital expenditure is likely inefficient and unsustainable—the authorities are thus urged to
undertake a prioritization (and cost-benefit analysis) of proposed public investment projects.
38.
St. Vincent and the Grenadines is among the most disaster-prone countries in
the world. The authorities have made great strides in boosting their disaster mitigation and
preparedness, through the drafting of a national disaster plan, and tightening building codes.
However, the mission recommends that the authorities undertake greater efforts to transfer
disaster risk, particularly through regional insurance pools and enhanced insurance of public
buildings and infrastructure assets.
39.
The financial sector remains vulnerable to adverse shocks. The government
should urgently present to Parliament amendments to the Uniform Banking Act, which
would significantly strengthen prudential supervision. In particular, the authorities should
give the ECCB licensing authority for banks under the new Act. Given the systemic
importance of the state-owned National Commercial Bank, the government is encouraged to
continue its efforts to address management and asset quality weaknesses. The large holding
of public sector debt by domestic banks renders the banking system vulnerable to uncertainty
as to the sustainability of public sector imbalances. To avoid a further build-up of financial

- 28 -

sector vulnerability as nonbank financial intermediaries grow in importance, staff
recommends that the authorities establish a broad supervisory framework to regulate all
nonbank financial intermediaries (including insurance companies, credit unions and other
near banks). The authorities’ efforts to enhance supervision of the offshore sector are
welcomed, and should be continued to ensure the consistency of the regulatory and
supervisory frameworks with international best practices.
40.
St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ statistical data remains weak in terms of
coverage, timeliness and frequency, and major improvements in all areas are needed to
facilitate policymaking and effective surveillance. Improvements are particularly needed
in the coverage of the national accounts (especially the tourism sector and related services),
and on data used to monitor labor market developments. In addition, while in areas central to
surveillance, notably central government accounts, financial sector indicators, and external
sector accounts, the data is of adequate quality for surveillance purposes, the data quality for
the rest of the public sector is quite poor, and obtained with considerable lags.
41.
Staff welcomes the government’s efforts at increasing opportunities for
discussion of public policy, especially through the formation of National Economic and
Social Development Council. The home-grown I-PRSP encapsulates the desire of the
government to build a public consensus behind the key objective of reducing poverty, and
the need for greater transparency. The authorities are commended for hosting the
International Banana Conference (in June 2004) as a means to consider policy options for the
industry. Increased efforts to disseminate and explain economic developments and policy
choices would also deepen the understanding of, and support for, structural reforms.
42.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

1/ Net of intra-public sector debt (mainly central government debt to the NIS). The consolidated public sector includes the government, the National Insurance Scheme (NIS), Kingstown
Board, and 10 nonfinancial public enterprises.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
8/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
9/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text and in Table 6 (top panel).
10/ In line with typical growth shortfall following a disaster in the eastern Caribbean, according to Rasmussen (2004), IMF Working Paper, 04/224.
11/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain
at their levels of the last projection year.

B1. Real interest rate is at historical average plus two standard deviations in 2006 and 2007
B2. Real GDP growth is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2006 and 2007
B3. Primary balance is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2006 and 2007
B4. Combination of B1-B3 using one standard deviation shocks

B. Bound Tests

A1. Key variables are at their historical averages in 2006-10 8/
A2. No policy change (constant primary balance) in 2006-10
A3. Current policies (as presented in 2005 budget) 9/
A4. Natural disaster in 2005 entails a reduction of real GDP growth of 2.2 percentage points 10/

g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
4/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.

ANNEX I

St. Vincent and the Grenadines: Preferential Trade Arrangement in Bananas
St. Vincent and the Grenadines and other Windward Islands (Dominica, Grenada and
St. Lucia) have a preferential trade arrangement in bananas with the European Union (EU).
St. Vincent and the Grenadines is among the world’s most preference-dependent economies,
being heavily reliant on annual income transfers derived from quota rents (income transfers
to preferred exporters from tariff revenue foregone in preference-granting markets) and
higher export revenues from sales into protected overseas markets.
The EU Banana Regime
Prior to the establishment of a Single European Market in 1993, EU countries had bilateral
arrangements with their ex-colonies in the Caribbean, Africa and the Pacific (“ACP”
bananas). Between 1993–98, the unified EU banana regime operated on the basis of an
annual ACP banana quota for duty-free export to the EU by 12 traditional producers, and an
annual quota for bananas from Latin America (“dollar” bananas), subject to a tariff. Given
the quantity restrictions and subsidies paid to EU banana producers, the price of bananas in
the EU averaged about 80 percent more than the world price.
Several reforms to the EU banana regime have been introduced since January 1, 1999.1 A key
modification is the move to a tariff-only regime (no quotas or licenses) for dollar bananas as
of January 1, 2006. The EU has proposed a (quota equivalent) tariff of US$300 (€230) per
tonne on the dollar (non-ACP) bananas. The conversion of quotas into tariffs will afford
some protection to ACP banana-exporting countries, but St. Vincent and the Grenadines is
likely to face strong competition from more efficient African ACP producers.
In March 2005, six Latin American countries filed a World Trade Organization (WTO)
challenge, arguing that the level of duty proposed by the EU under its tariff-only regime
would be discriminatory against non-ACP banana producers. However, while Latin
American producers have argued that such a tariff increases protection to ACP suppliers,
ACP countries fear that the tariff will not prevent a supply-induced collapse in banana prices.
Importantly, the WTO (Cotonou) waiver authorizing tariff preferences to the ACP countries
will apply only if the new tariff is set at a level that will result in at least maintaining total
market access for all WTO suppliers. In addition, by January 2006 the EU’s Everything But
Arms (EBA) initiative will provide for full liberalization of banana exports from non-ACP
least developed countries, which will result in the further erosion of preferences to ACP
banana suppliers.

1

Under the current regime, Latin American exporters face a tariff of €75/tonne up to 2.7 million metric tons and
€680/tonne above that level. ACP countries benefit from duty free access for 750,000 metric tonnes.

- 41 -

ANNEX I

The changes in the banana regime set for 2006 represent a big challenge for Windward
Islands banana producers. The banana industry is privately operated mainly in small farms,
with more than half the farms constituting less than 10 acres. Caribbean banana exports to
the EU exhibit the highest unit costs in the world, arising from diseconomies of scale, low
land productivity, high labor and transportation costs. The estimates by National Economic
Research Associates (NERA) suggest that St. Vincent banana exports would remain viable at
a tariff of €230 per tonne, but would likely cease at tariff levels below €175 per tonne.
Policy Responses
Policy responses undertaken by the authorities in order to adjust to the new regime include:
(i) subsidizing key inputs (particularly fertilizers); (ii) paying off the debt of banana
producers’ associations; (ii) exempting farmers’ incomes from tax; (iii) the establishment of
Windward Islands Banana Development and Exporting Company Limited as a marketing
agent and partial owner of the shipping service, to ensure more benefits to the farmers from
various links in the chain from production to distribution and marketing; and (iv) the
implementation of a Certified Growers Programme which enshrines industry standards
within the framework of a contract.
EU Assistance to Facilitate the Transition
Two main sources of EU funds that have been available to Caribbean (ACP) bananaproducing countries are: (i) Special Framework of Assistance (SFA)—programmed on an
annual basis since 1999 for a ten-year period, designed to boost the productivity of
producers, encourage diversification (away from agriculture), and provide social protection.
Under the SFA, St. Vincent and the Grenadines has been allocated assistance of €33 million
between 1999 and 2004. (ii) Export revenue stabilization schemes (STABEX and FLEX)—
designed to compensate for declining and volatile export earnings and to target to specific
capital investments within the overall national Public Sector Investment Programme of
recipient countries. STABEX allocations to St. Vincent and the Grenadines in the 1993–2000
period amounted to €74.1 million.

ANNEX II

Medium-Term Outlook Under Alternative Fiscal Scenarios
A continuation of current fiscal policies would lead to an unsustainable level of debt,
and the high stock of debt is placing an increasingly heavy burden on the economy. In
line with World Economic Outlook assumptions, the interest rate on new borrowings is
projected to increase by 1½ percentage points over the next five years, from the current
average of about 4¾ percent per annum.
Two fiscal scenarios are considered—current policies and an active scenario. Under the
current policies scenario, the debt stock continues to rise; under the active scenario discussed
in the text, the stock of debt declines gradually over the medium term.
Current policies scenario. The authorities continue current expansionary policies with large
overall imbalances that are financed commercially. Financing is assumed to continue to be
available, no matter what level the debt stock reaches. In the absence of improvements in the
investment climate, growth remains driven by the public sector, and slows to about
2½ percent over the medium term. Under this scenario, the central government primary
deficit remains at about 1½ percent of GDP and public debt rises to over 95 percent of GDP
by 2010 (see Table 6, Scenario I).
Active scenario. A fiscal adjustment of 2½ percent is assumed for 2005 (see main text) and
further adjustment over the medium term, with the central government primary balance
moving from a deficit of 0.9 percent of GDP in 2004 to a surplus of 4.7 percent of GDP in
2010. Trend growth accelerates with the greater activity in the private sector, and is
estimated at 4 percent of GDP over the medium term. In this scenario, the debt stock would
fall to about 64 percent of GDP by 2010 (see Table 6, Scenario II and Table 7).

Exchange Arrangement:

St. Vincent and the Grenadines is a member of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB),
which manages monetary policy and the exchange system for its eight members. The
common currency, the Eastern Caribbean dollar, has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the
rate of EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar since July 1976. In practice the ECCB has operated like a
quasi-currency board, maintaining foreign exchange backing of its currency and demand
liabilities of close to 100 percent. The exchange system is free of restrictions on the making
of payment and transfers for current international transactions. The exchange control on the
EC$250,000 limit on purchase of foreign exchange without the authorization of the Ministry
of Finance was removed in December 2004.

St. Vincent and the Grenadines—Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of May 25, 2005)
The World Bank’s Management presented to its Board the Eastern Caribbean Sub-Region
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), on June 28, 2001. The CAS, which covers FY 2002–06,
proposes new commitments of US$107 million for five borrowing member states of the
Organization of the Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), including St. Vincent and the
Grenadines. The main goals of the strategy are to reduce income insecurity and vulnerability
at the national and household levels, and build human and institutional capacity to meet the
challenging economic and social environment facing these small states. Most new projects
are being provided under a sub-regional umbrella mechanism using horizontal Adaptable
Program Loans (APLs), and in close collaboration with sub-regional organizations and
external partners.
The World Bank is currently preparing a new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the
Eastern Caribbean (OECS) sub-region. This new CAS will cover the period FY 2006–09.
I. PROJECTS
There are four active World Bank projects in St. Vincent and the Grenadines for a net
commitment of approximately US$22.3 million.
The St. Vincent and the Grenadines Disaster Management Project, approved in May 2002,
is part of a regional program for the five OECS borrowing countries to fortify, reconstruct,
and/or rehabilitate key economic and social infrastructure and facilities, in order to minimize
damage or disruption caused by future natural and man-made disasters, and to speed
emergency recovery following such disasters. Additionally, the project is expected to
strengthen the countries’ institutional capacity to prepare for and respond to disaster
emergencies efficiently and effectively. The total program is US$46 million, and the
St. Vincent and the Grenadines component is US$5.9 million.
On March 8, 2002, the World Bank approved US$20.9 million in loans and credits to support
Emergency Recovery Projects in Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and
St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The projects support efforts aimed at fostering recovery from
the fallout of the events of September 11, 2001, including: (i) efforts to safeguard the productive
capacity of the tourism sector by securing energy imports; (ii) investments to enhance security at
airports and ports; and (iii) the development of institutional capacity to develop security
programs as mandated by international civil aviation and maritime transport agencies. The
Bank’s support to St. Vincent and the Grenadines under this project is US$3.2 million.
The St. Vincent and the Grenadines Education Reform Project, was approved in
June 2004 for US$6.2 million. The overall objective of this project is to build human capital
to contribute to the diversification of the economy and more sustainable growth. This

- 47 -

APPENDIX II

objective will be achieved by: (i) increasing equitable access to secondary education;
(ii) improving the quality of the teaching and learning process, with more direct interventions
at the school level and a focus on student-centered learning, and (iii) strengthening
management of the sector and governance of schools.
The HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Program, which was approved in July 2002, is
funded under the Multi-Country APL for the Caribbean Region. The project’s objectives are:
(i) curbing the spread of HIV/AIDS epidemic; (ii) reducing the morbidity and mortality
attributed to HIV/AIDS; (iii) improving the quality of life for persons living with HIV/AIDS
(PLWAs); and (iv) developing a sustainable organizational and institutional framework for
managing the HIV/AIDS epidemic over the longer term. The Bank’s support to St. Vincent
and the Grenadines under this project is for US$7.0 million.
II. ECONOMIC AND SECTOR WORK
The Bank has recently completed a series of analytical reports relating to: public sector
capacity in the OECS including the Institutional and Organizational Capacity Review, the
OECS Procurement Assessment Review, the OECS Financial Accountability Assessment,
and a Public Expenditure Review. In conjunction with the IMF, a Financial Sector
Assessment Program was completed in 2004. In addition, the Bank recently completed an
OECS study on Growth and Competitiveness, as well as a Caribbean wide study on Growth
and Competitiveness. A review of large scale energy options for the OECS, under the Energy
Sector Management Assistance Program is ongoing. St. Vincent and the Grenadines also
stands to benefit from ongoing Caribbean-wide work on Social Protection.

APPENDIX IV

St. Vincent and the Grenadines—Statistical Issues
St. Vincent and the Grenadines has been participating in the General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS) since September 2000, and its metadata are posted on the Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB). St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ statistical database
remains weak in terms of coverage, consistency, periodicity, and timeliness. Major
improvements in all areas are needed to facilitate effective surveillance. Efforts to address
the weaknesses in the statistical base have been hampered by low response rates to surveys
(less than 50 percent), and high turnover of staff.
Prices: Data on the consumer price index (CPI) are reported regularly with a two-month lag.
CARTAC assisted in linking the 1981-based CPI series to the 2001-based one. This was part
of the Fund assisted program on Constructing Weights for the Harmonized Consumer Price
Index in the ECCU. St. Vincent and the Grenadines conducted the Household Budget and
Expenditure Survey (HBES) in 1995/96, whilst all the other five ECCU member countries
conducted HBES surveys for 1998/99. Compilers thus will have to use a method for updating
the St. Vincent expenditure weights to 1998/99 to properly align its CPI with those of the
other ECCU member countries before all eight are combined into an ECCU-harmonized CPI.
Labor: The Statistical Office has not published official data on unit labor costs and
employment. Results of the 2001 population census have been analyzed and published.
National Accounts: National accounts data by sector are provided with one-year lag, and the
coverage of economic activity in the informal sector is inadequate. There is a need to fully
upgrade compilation of statistics from the 1968 System of National Accounts to the 1993
System of National Accounts. In addition, data on GDP broken down by type of expenditure
are not available at constant prices, while data at current prices are not reliable due to
weaknesses in estimating gross capital formation. Private final consumption expenditure is
estimated as a residual.
Public finance: The IMF publishes annual data for the consolidated general government in
the GFS Yearbook, with the 2004 edition showing annual data to 2003. Only cash data are
shown, with a detailed classification of revenue and a functional, but not economic type,
classification of expenses. No financing information is provided and the only balance sheet
data shown are domestic and foreign liabilities for 2001. Due to delays in reporting capital
expenditures by some ministries, quarterly revenue and expenditure data for the central
government are provided to the Fund with some lag. Discrepancies exist between the fiscal
and monetary accounts, between above and below the line for budget data, and between
financing data and debt accumulation. There is a need to reconcile these discrepancies.
Although domestic debt figures are now available following implementation of the
CS-DRMS system, the domestic debt amortization figures are incomplete. The public
enterprises financial reports are not timely, with about a two-year lag.

APPENDIX IV

Monetary statistics: Monetary data are compiled by the ECCB on a monthly basis. The data
are reported regularly to the Fund, although the timeliness of data could be improved. The
monetary and financial data do not include other deposit-taking institutions such as the credit
unions. The ECCB is aware of the need to improve the coverage of the financial statistics and
has taken steps to collect data on credit unions (the savings and loans of credit unions
account for 20–30 percent of market share).
Balance of payments: Estimates for St. Vincent and the Grenadines are currently provided
on an annual basis by the ECCB, using a format that is not fully consistent with BPM5. The
latest published data in the IFS (March 2005) refer to 2002. There is a need to improve the
compilation of capital and financial account transactions in the balance of payments. In
addition, the recording of the stock of private and public debt should be improved.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with
St. Vincent and the Grenadines
On July 13, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with St. Vincent and the Grenadines.1
Background
St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ economy grew rapidly during the 1980s, but has slowed
significantly since the early 1990s. Factors inhibiting the growth performance over the past
decade include a series of adverse shocks—the erosion of trade preferences, poor weather
and natural disasters, the September 11 2001 attack which had a negative impact on the
important tourism sector, and the decline in overseas development assistance. In order to
accelerate growth, the authorities began in the late 1990s to implement expansionary fiscal
policies, leading to persistent public sector imbalances. As a result, the stock of public debt
rose from less than 50 percent of GDP in 1997 to almost 80 percent of GDP in 2004.
Economic activity has strengthened, with real GDP growing by 4.3 percent in 2004, and further
acceleration expected in 2005. This improved performance was underpinned by a supportive
external environment, strong growth in tourism, and a rebound in construction and agriculture
sectors. However, fiscal imbalances expanded in 2004, with the primary balance of the central
government deteriorating by ⅓ of one percent of GDP to reach almost 1 percent of GDP in
2004. The approved budget for 2005 is likely to lead to a significant further deterioration in the
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.

-2fiscal accounts, mainly due to a large increase in discretionary spending (particularly on wages
and capital spending), despite an increase in revenues. This is likely to lead to a further rise in
public debt levels, reaching almost 81 percent of GDP in 2005.
The external current account deficit widened substantially in 2004 to about 26 percent of GDP,
and is likely to deteriorate further in 2005. The large rise in the current account deficit in 2004
was driven by a decline in exports, and a general rise in imports, especially of energy products
and building materials. In 2005 the current account is expected to continue to deteriorate,
mainly on account of higher imports due to additional public capital expenditure and rising oil
import costs, despite a rebound in banana export earnings.
Reflecting the continued recovery in economic activity, monetary liabilities and domestic credit
have rebounded. Broad money (M2) growth accelerated in 2004, as deposits with the banking
sector rose strongly. While net lending to the central government continued to decline in 2004,
credit to the private sector rose marginally. Net foreign assets of the banking system surged,
as both commercial banks’ net foreign assets and St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ implicit
reserves at the ECCB increased substantially.
Financial sector indicators have improved in recent years. Supervision and regulation of the
offshore sector has strengthened, assisted by the adoption of the International Bank Act in
2004. Prudential indicators point to weaknesses in the domestic banking sector, although
efforts are ongoing to improve bank balance sheets. Indigenous banks suffer from a number of
weaknesses, including total capital-to-risk-weighted assets that are considerably below the
ECCU average, a large portfolio of nonperforming loans, and high public sector exposures.
Progress has been made in broader structural reforms. With the support of the European
Union, the authorities have continued in their efforts to diversify production into non-banana
agriculture (under the Agricultural Diversification Program). Progress has also occurred in
domestic pricing of energy inputs and in tax administration, as well as in efforts to improve
labor skills through training programs. A one-stop shop for foreign investment enquiries and
facilitation has been created with the establishment of the National Investment Promotions
Incorporated. The authorities have restated their intention to bolster revenue-raising by the
introduction of a value-added tax and market valuation-based property taxation in 2007.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that economic activity has strengthened in 2004, despite the impact
of Hurricane Ivan, and welcomed the prospects for accelerated growth in 2005. The improved
performance has been aided by sustained activity in construction and a favorable external
environment. The tourism sector has expanded rapidly with the increase in stay-over arrivals
during 2004. Prospects for further expansion in the sector, including tourism-related services
and associated construction activity, appear strong and are likely to underpin economic growth
for the next several years. Directors saw the main challenges going forward to be to accelerate
growth and reduce poverty, while restoring fiscal and external viability and reducing the debt

-3burden. They also underscored the importance of further regional cooperation so as to help
the country reap the full potential benefits of the ECCU.
While traditionally among the most fiscally prudent of the ECCU countries, Directors noted that
St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ public debt has increased significantly in recent years, in
substantial part due to the assumption of a large private external loan by the government.
They also observed that the fiscal outlook for 2005 is quite difficult, and urged the authorities to
address the weakening fiscal situation by implementing appropriate measures to reduce public
borrowing. They noted that, in the absence of a strong effort to address the growing fiscal
imbalances, the public debt could be placed on an unsustainable path. Directors stressed that
such a high debt level raises the risk from adverse shocks, and acts to constrain the
government’s future ability to engage in counter-cyclical fiscal policy. In light of these
considerations, Directors underscored the need for strong fiscal action to reduce debt
sustainability risks, while making room for social and other priority outlays. Pointing to the need
to strengthen infrastructure and poverty alleviation, some Directors supported the need for
strategic investments that would entail a short-term increase in the fiscal deficit.
Directors welcomed the government’s plans to improve tax policy and administration in order
to broaden the tax base and reduce concessions. They regarded the planned adoption of a
value added tax and market-based property taxation as steps in the right direction.
They cautioned, however, that more needs to be done, particularly in the area of tax
concessions. Directors advised the authorities to seek greater regional cooperation, in order to
have a common approach to tax concessions, and thereby avoid region-wide tax competition.
The importance of improving the transparency of concessions was also noted.
On the expenditure side, Directors emphasized the need to control the wage bill, which has
increased rapidly in recent years due to an increase in civil service employment.
They recommended the adoption of a wide-ranging civil service reform, in order to ensure that
expenditure consolidation can be achieved without impinging on the quality of service
provision. At the same time, Directors recommended that the authorities undertake
cost-benefit analyses and prioritization of the extremely high level of proposed public
investment projects.
Directors were encouraged by the good progress made by the authorities in boosting their
disaster mitigation and preparedness, through the drafting of a national disaster plan,
and implementation of a national building code. They recommended that the authorities
undertake greater efforts to transfer disaster risk, including through regional insurance pools,
enhanced insurance of public buildings and infrastructure assets, and better enforcement of
building codes.
Directors observed that the financial sector remains vulnerable to adverse shocks. They urged
that measures be taken to strengthen the effectiveness of financial sector supervision, such as
through the approval of amendments to the Uniform Banking Act and development of a broad
supervisory framework to regulate all nonbank financial intermediaries (including insurance
companies, credit unions and other near banks). Given the systemic importance of the

-4state-owned National Commercial Bank, the government was encouraged to continue its
efforts to address management and asset quality weaknesses. Directors welcomed the
authorities’ efforts to enhance supervision of the offshore sector, and encouraged them to
continue to ensure the consistency of the regulatory and supervisory frameworks with
international best practices.
Directors noted the need to strengthen the quality, coverage, timeliness, and frequency of the
statistical database to facilitate policymaking and effective surveillance. They encouraged the
authorities to address these data problems, and stressed that improvements are particularly
needed in the coverage of the national accounts, in data used to monitor labor market and
poverty developments, and in the financial data of public enterprises and statutory bodies.
Directors commended the government’s efforts at increasing opportunities for public
discussion of policy choices, especially through the formation of the National Economic and
Social Development Council. They welcomed the home-grown Interim Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper, as it encapsulates the desire of the government to build a public consensus
behind the key objective of reducing poverty, and the need for greater transparency. Directors
commended the authorities for their efforts in tackling the problems associated with the erosion
of trade preferences for the banana industry, and welcomed the government’s hosting of the
International Conference on prospects for the sector. Directors noted that increased efforts to
disseminate and explain economic developments and policy choices would also deepen the
public’s understanding of, and support for, structural reforms.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
