STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 21, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Short-term vulnerabilities have risen significantly amid high fiscal and current
account deficits. The international reserve position has weakened alongside
mounting public debt. High interest rates and a depreciating currency have begun
to weaken private sector activity, and spreads on Ghana’s Eurobonds have risen
above those of regional peers.
Economic growth is slowing from previously high levels. Following estimated
GDP growth of 5½ percent in 2013, staff projects a further deceleration to
4¾ percent in 2014. Driven by the depreciation and administered price increases,
inflation reached 13½ percent at end-2013 and 14½ percent in March.
Monetary policy was tightened, as the fiscal consolidation target was missed.
Despite significant policy efforts, the 2013 fiscal (cash) deficit reached an estimated
10.9 percent of GDP, versus a target of 9 percent. In the absence of additional
measures, the 2014 deficit is projected at 10¼ percent of GDP, with consolidation
made more difficult by slower growth. To address rising inflation, the monetary
policy rate was raised to 18 percent and reserve requirements were tightened.
Current vulnerabilities put Ghana’s transformation agenda at risk. The
government’s objectives of economic diversification, shared growth and job
creation, and macroeconomic stability rely on the reallocation of resources from
current to capital spending. Yet, high twin deficits and large interest payments on
rising public debt are crowding out priority expenditure and private sector activity.
Macroeconomic stability will need to be restored to preserve a positive mediumterm outlook.
The financial sector is adequately capitalized and liquid, but increasing
exposures will need to be monitored closely. Stress tests conducted by the Bank
of Ghana suggest that buffers are adequate in most banks and the system in
aggregate. Nevertheless, the weaker macroeconomic outlook and currency
depreciation expose the financial sector to credit and foreign exchange risks,
warranting a strengthening of crisis prevention and management capabilities.

BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Political uncertainty has been resolved. President Mahama’s National Democratic Congress
was reelected in December 2012 by a small margin in the popular vote, but with a sizeable
parliamentary majority. Following a challenge by the opposition party, the supreme court confirmed the
election results in September, ending a period of political uncertainty.
2.
Ghana has experienced strong and broadly inclusive growth over the past two decades
and its medium-term prospects are supported by rising energy production. The country has

production will boost exports and carry the

constraints by making the provision of energy
more reliable.
Sources: World Bank, World Development Indicators, 2013.
3.
The government’s transformation agenda is focused on economic diversification, social
inclusion, and macroeconomic stability (Box 2). A key aspect of the strategy is a major shift of public
expenditure from current to capital spending, to ensure that Ghana’s still new oil and gas resources are
channeled into productive investment, as mandated in the Petroleum Revenue Management Act.
4.
However, the emergence of large fiscal and external imbalances since 2012 has created
significant challenges. The fiscal (cash) deficit rose to 12 percent of GDP in 2012, fueled by a large
public sector wage bill and costly energy subsidies. The fiscal expansion was accompanied by a growing
current account deficit that exceeded significant FDI, loans, and portfolio inflows attracted by high
interest rates on domestic bonds. As a result, public debt increased significantly and the international
reserve position weakened alongside a depreciating currency.
5.
A swift return to macroeconomic stability in 2013 was thwarted by weaker domestic and
external conditions and ongoing difficulties in controlling public wages:


Economic growth slowed from previously high levels (Figure 1). While oil production grew
strongly, non-oil growth was affected by disruptions in power supply in the first half of the year and
falling gold production related to the drop in world prices. High interest rates and rising import
costs due to the depreciation began to depress private sector activity. Staff assumes a growth
deceleration to 5½ percent in 2013.

Box 1. Doing Business in Ghana: Opportunities and Bottlenecks
Ghana’s governance and business environment is highly rated and has continued to improve. Ghana’s
ratings in the World Bank’s governance and business indicators are significantly above those of its peers and
regional benchmarks. Its ratings have continued to improve, accelerating past even the average upper-middle
income country in most areas of governance and business climate.

However, businesses face a number of important constraints. An analysis by the U.S. and Ghanaian
governments, based on firm-level surveys, has identified lack of access to affordable credit and unreliable
electricity supply as principal constraints on growth. The same factors were confirmed as key bottlenecks in a
recent informal sector survey conducted by the World Bank. Both present a particularly heavy burden for small
and medium-sized, labor-intensive enterprises, where growth is most inclusive.

Unlocking Ghana’s strong private sector growth potential will require changes in policies. Ghana’s
financial sector is relatively well developed and competitive, but will only provide sufficiently affordable credit to
the private sector once the government reduces its borrowing needs. New gas production will help meet
growing energy demand, but reliable electricity supply will require significant public and private investments in
the power sector, which are currently hampered by concerns over the financial viability of the state-owned
energy companies. Further tariff adjustments, along with reductions in commercial and technical losses, will be
needed to ensure cost recovery.

Box 2. Inclusive Growth and Economic Transformation
Ghana has experienced strong and broadly inclusive growth over the past 20 years, evidenced by
significant improvements in poverty and social indicators and its transition to lower middle-income
status. Nevertheless, about a quarter of the population still lives below the poverty line, and 6–7 million
jobs (more than half of the current labor force) will need to be created in the next two decades, to absorb
new entrants into the labor market. Success will hinge on complementing rising production from
extractive industries with diversified, private sector-led growth in more labor-intensive sectors.1
The government’s transformation agenda pursues three broad objectives:

Economic diversification. Ghana’s economy, and
Sectoral Employment and Output Shares
particularly employment, still relies heavily on agriculture,
and some 80 percent of jobs are in the informal sector. At
the same time, the concentration of exports in three

Petroleum Revenue Management Act dedicates at least
70 percent of benchmark oil revenue to investments in identified priority areas, including road and
infrastructure improvements, agricultural modernization, and capacity building (including in the oil and gas
sector).

Social inclusion. To make further advancements in poverty reduction, ensure that the benefits of
growth are widely shared, and build a workforce ready to take on higher-skilled jobs, the government
wants to further strengthen Ghana’s social safety net and continue investments in utilities, health, and
education.

Macroeconomic stability. The government has emphasized the importance of a stable
macroeconomic environment and sustainable debt dynamics for the achievement of its growth and
development objectives. It is targeting a gradual fiscal consolidation to reduce the twin deficit and lower
inflation over the medium term.



The fiscal target was missed, despite significant measures to contain the deficit (Figure 2).
Faced with shortfalls in tax collection and grants, relative to budget targets, and ongoing overruns
in the wage bill, the government imposed levies on certain imports and on profits of specific sectors
mid-year. It also reinstated the fuel-price adjustment mechanism to eliminate subsidies; sharply
raised electricity and water tariffs (the former by 60 percent); and compressed other spending.
While these measures were in line with recommendations in the 2013 Article IV consultation, the
weaker-than-anticipated economic environment would have demanded a stronger and earlier
effort. The cash deficit reached an estimated 10.9 percent of GDP, versus a 9 percent target.
Domestic arrears declined marginally, implying a slightly smaller deficit (10.8 percent of GDP) on a
commitment basis.



Inflation ended the year at 13½ percent, above the 9+/-2
percent target range. Large administered price hikes
contributed to this outcome, though staff’s estimate of core
inflation (excluding high administered, but also low food price
increases) was even larger at 15 percent. Faced with growing
liquidity from a high fiscal deficit and currency swaps with local
banks, the BOG ramped up sterilization operations, while
steering interbank rates close to the policy rate. The latter was
raised in February 2014 by 200 basis points to 18 percent, and
in April, the BOG increased reserve requirements from 9 to
11 percent and tightened limits on banks’ net open positions.
Government bond rates, which had declined to 19 percent
during 2013, helped by a US$1 billion Eurobond, climbed
again to 23 percent in early 2014.

The external position has become increasingly fragile.
With weaker gold and cocoa exports, the estimated current
account deficit rose above 13 percent of GDP in 2013, with some 7 percent of GDP financed by FDI
(Figure 3). As a result, the cedi depreciated by close to 15 percent in 2013 and 18 percent in the first
quarter of 2014 alone, while spreads on Ghana’s Eurobonds are now the highest among SSA
frontier markets. An exchange market pressure index—combining changes in the exchange rate,
interest rates, and reserves—has recently risen above 2009 levels, but remains below 2012 peaks.

Rising vulnerabilities were a central focus of the discussions. Staff saw serious risks to the
government’s transformation agenda. It cautioned that macroeconomic stability will need to
be restored to preserve a positive medium-term outlook.

The fiscal adjustment is expected to be mirrored in a gradual reduction in external imbalances, a
stabilization of the currency, and a declining inflation path, with continued strong growth.
7.
Staff saw the government’s targets at risk in the absence of additional fiscal measures,
pointing to the macroeconomic costs of large fiscal imbalances. Constrained foreign financing and
limited scope to boost exports in the short term will keep pressure on the cedi, forcing an adjustment in
imports and keeping inflation high. Staff’s baseline assumes a contraction in the current account deficit
by 2½ percentage points of GDP in 2014, with high interest rates and the depreciation slowing growth
to a projected 4¾ percent. This will raise government interest payments and dampen revenue, implying
a projected fiscal deficit of 10¼ percent of GDP. Any slippages in ambitious primary current spending
projections would raise the deficit further.
8.
Staff stressed more serious risks to this outlook in the event of a further deterioration in
the external environment (see Appendix I). Ghana’s main vulnerability arises from its large twin
deficits in the context of a low reserve buffer, sustained by swaps and bridging loans (Box 3). The sum
of Ghana’s non-FDI financed current account deficit, amortization on foreign loans, maturing domestic
bonds held by non-residents, and maturing swaps and bridging loans, amounts to a total gross external
financing need of $4.3 billion in 2014—corresponding to about three-quarters of the reserve stock at
end-2013. Against this background, a further weakening in the terms of trade, or a larger outflow of
foreign financing, could have a significant impact on reserves and force a more drastic depreciation

Box 3. Reserve Adequacy

After a second year of large balance of payments deficits and ongoing pressures, Ghana’s gross international
reserves (GIR) declined to US$4.7 billion at end-March 2014, covering 2.7 months of prospective imports.1
A standardized approach assesses Ghana’s gross reserves to
be below adequate levels. Following Dabla-Norris et al.
(2011), the net benefit of holding reserves is calculated based
on the expected cost of a crisis given the stock of reserves,
fundamentals (exchange rate regime, fiscal balance,
institutions), exposure to shocks (external demand, FDI, aid),
and the opportunity cost of holding reserves, quantified as the
“normal” range of the interest differential over 10-year U.S.
bonds (300 to 400 bps).2 The approach suggests that Ghana’s
international reserves should have covered 3.4-4.7 months of
imports in 2013, under the 50 percent default probability of a
shock. Reserves should be higher (4.1-5.6 months of imports)
for a shock probability of 60 percent. In the medium term, with
a stronger fiscal position, reserves are expected to exceed
benchmark levels.

Ghana’s balance of payments is subject to significant short-term and seasonal pressures. A further
deterioration in the terms of trade, such as a drop in gold prices to US$1,000 per ounce, could wipe off an
additional US$800 million in reserves. Moreover, the traditional weakening of the BOP position in the first
three quarters could be exacerbated by prospective financial outflows:
Bond rollovers. About one-fourth (GH¢5.6 billion) of Ghana’s domestic debt at end-2013 was held by
foreigners. Of this, about GH¢870 million will mature in 2014 (nearly all by June), adding to short-term
pressures. Reflecting virtually no foreign rollover in February, the baseline assumes a similar outcome also
for other bonds. Early redemptions—costly, due to an illiquid secondary market—are not assumed, but
could exacerbate outflows.
Commercial banks. During 2013, banks significantly reduced their net foreign assets by borrowing from
foreign affiliates to meet high dollar demand. These flows are assumed to be reversed in 2014, with early
reversal potentially adding to seasonal pressures.
BOG swaps and bridging loans. Gross reserves are subject to rollover risks from swap engagements with
several commercial banks and short-term bridging loans with foreign institutions.

and import compression. Interest rates would have to be hiked by more to contain an accelerating
inflation rate, while lower revenue combined with higher interest payments would further widen the
fiscal deficit. In this case, the economic costs in terms of growth and employment, and the efforts
needed to restore stability, would be significant.
9.
Apart from short-term risks, the authorities’ gradual fiscal adjustment implies continuing
vulnerabilities and significant costs over the medium term. It would keep the fiscal and current
account deficits elevated and above external sustainability benchmarks (Box 4), prolonging the need for
a tight monetary policy stance and leaving external buffers low. Moreover, Ghana’s risk of debt distress
would be approaching high levels, with the public debt ratio remaining close to 60 percent of GDP and
debt service absorbing some 40-50 percent of revenue.1

Box 4. External Sustainability
Medium-term current account benchmarks for Ghana range from -4.4 to -2.1 percent of GDP. Various
approaches to external sustainability suggest that the current account adjustment, and the associated fiscal
consolidation, should be stronger than currently projected. Without additional fiscal adjustment, the analysis would
imply a modest cedi overvaluation of 6.9-14.4 percent in the medium term.

Baseline projections imply a narrowing of the current account deficit to 6¾ percent of GDP in 2019. This
reflects moderate fiscal consolidation, less reliance on expensive fuel imports as gas comes on stream, and a
significant increase in oil production. The difference to the last Article IV assessment (8½ percent of GDP) is
mainly attributed to an upward revision of oil production and the depreciation that has already taken place.
Three approaches are used—an external sustainability (ES), a macroeconomic balance (MB), and a
model-based approach—to provide a robust assessment of external sustainability.
The ES approach yields a current account benchmark of -4.2
percent of GDP. The benchmark is derived on the basis of a fixed
NFA target of -40 percent of GDP (the median of middle-income
countries), as well as staff’s growth and inflation projections. While
useful as an accounting identity, this approach abstracts from the
country’s underlying fundamentals.
Applications of the MB approach yield current account
benchmarks between -4.4 and -2.1 percent of GDP in 2019. This
approach estimates Ghana’s benchmark on the basis of its
fundamentals relative to its trading partners, with Ghana’s
relatively high GDP per capita growth and its oil trade balance
driving much of the results. While providing a multilaterally
consistent benchmark, the MB approach does not capture the
potential use of Ghana’s recent oil windfall for infrastructure
investments over the medium term.

The model provides a current account benchmark of -4.3 percent of GDP in 2019, and advocates for

Box 4. External Sustainability (concluded)
The main part of the adjustment would “optimally” come from lower public expenditure (2¾ percent of GDP).
The optimal breakdown between consumption and investment depends on the efficiency of public capital.
Under the model’s assumption (based on historical data), the projected high level of public investment would
account for about 60 percent of the excess public expenditure relative to the model. However, an assumed
increase in the efficiency index by only 5 percentage points would raise benchmark capital expenditure to
currently projected levels in the medium run. In this scenario, the main part of fiscal consolidation would need
to come from a further reduction in public consumption.

POLICIES TO SAFEGUARD STABILITY AND GROWTH
A. Fiscal Policy: Adjustment and Resilience
To restore confidence and build resilience, staff recommended a comprehensive policy
package that (i) targets additional fiscal adjustment of about 1¾ percent of GDP in 2014,
and (ii) entrenches the structural and legislative reforms that ensure more significant and
durable consolidation over the medium term.
11.
The authorities agreed with staff on the need to reduce the fiscal deficit, pointing to the
significant measures already underway. They saw the current challenges as temporary, stressing that
their measures will take some time to materialize fully and that their policies needed to be viewed in a
medium-term context. In addition to regular adjustments of fuel and utility prices, budget measures
include:


Revenue mobilization. The VAT rate was raised by 2.5 percentage points and coverage was
broadened to previously exempted activities; an ad valorem tax on fuel was introduced; and taxes
were raised on rent for non-residential accommodation, management and technical services fees,
and free zone companies selling on the local market.



Wage bill control. Tight budget limits on the wage bill (proposed freeze on wage increases and net
hiring in most sectors) are being complemented by a range of measures to improve monitoring and
control, including an improved payroll database, audits, and the introduction of an electronic
payment voucher system. The implementation of HRMIS (a comprehensive personnel data base)
and its integration with GIFMIS, once completed, should greatly facilitate strategic HR management.



Prioritized capital spending. This is implemented through a moratorium on new contracts;
alignment of investment programs of statutory funds with national priorities to avoid duplications;
and the planned creation a Ghana Infrastructure Fund (GIF), to leverage private financing of
infrastructure projects and improve their selection and implementation. The authorities took note of
the mission’s advice to carefully assess fiscal risks arising from contingent liabilities and to
reconsider a permanent earmarking of VAT revenue to the GIF.

12.
While agreeing with the thrust of these reforms, the mission argued for deeper
irreversible reforms to entrench significant medium-term consolidation. A credible program for
reducing the public wage bill, including streamlining of subvented agencies, will be key for addressing
imbalances, restoring confidence, and creating fiscal space for priority spending. At the same time,
public financial management reforms should be accelerated and combined with a relaxation of rigid
earmarking of tax revenue. Staff also saw scope for raising revenue by reducing tax expenditure and
increasing compliance, in line with the recommendations of recent Fund technical assistance missions.
The mission identified a set of measures (text table) that should allow a larger deficit reduction, in line
with staff’s proposed adjustment scenario (4½ percent of GDP deficit in 2016 and 1¾ percent in 2019).
In addition, it stressed that increased transparency of revenue and expenditure allocations at all levels

13.
To contain immediate vulnerabilities, staff urged the adoption of additional short-term
measures. While recognizing the limited space for large upfront adjustments, staff saw scope for
additional savings of about 1¾ percent of GDP this year, through a combination of revenue and
expenditure measures (text table). To achieve the desired outcome, staff stressed the need to enforce
budget discipline in all areas. Existing commitments, such as tight wage limits and no aggregate
subsidies on fuel and utilities, will need to be rigorously enforced. This will require that electricity tariffs
rise temporarily above cost-recovery levels—once gas comes on stream—to compensate for the underpricing that is currently taking place.

14.
In early April, the government issued a policy statement to parliament, aimed at
addressing the current economic challenges. Subsequently, it provided a more detailed report on its
Economic and Financial Policies for the Medium Term to the Fund and other development partners. The
policy document maintains the government’s fiscal targets, clarifies the 2014 budget measures, and
outlines additional reforms to safeguard the medium-term consolidation path. The additional measures
include intentions to rationalize the public service, restructure statutory funds to reduce budget
rigidities, and enhance revenue administration through ongoing GRA reforms and a revision of tax laws.
15.
Staff welcomes the government’s homegrown strategy to address the current
macroeconomic imbalances. The policy documents provide a clear and comprehensive description of
the government’s reform agenda, covering the key fiscal challenges. This is an important first step that
now needs to be translated into specific, quantified, and time-bound actions, particularly with respect to
the planned rationalization of the public service and tax policy measures. In light of Ghana’s significant
fiscal and external imbalances, staff would strongly encourage the government to target a larger and
more frontloaded fiscal consolidation.

B. Monetary Policy: Supporting Macroeconomic Stability
Staff supported the tightening of monetary policy. It expressed reservations about the effectiveness
of recent foreign exchange regulations, and agreed with the BOG that these measures alone will
not solve the underlying pressures in the foreign exchange market.
16.
Staff supported the recent policy rate adjustment, anticipating that further tightening
may be warranted in light of rising inflation and a depreciating currency. Second-round effects of
large administered price increases and rising inflation expectations may call for further rate hikes to
steer inflation back toward the end-year target band of 9.5+/-2 percent. A tight monetary policy stance
will also support a smooth adjustment of the exchange rate, which should be allowed to adjust to
prevent further erosion of an already low reserve buffer. To contain short-term pressures, staff advised
the BOG to continue its efforts to lengthen the maturity structure of its existing swaps and bridging
loans beyond the third quarter of 2014. Once external pressures subside, reserves should be rebuilt, and
the volume of swaps should be reduced and limited to the management of seasonal balance of
payments volatility.
17.
Staff welcomed improvements in monetary policy operations, while advocating against
direct government financing and for more transparent foreign exchange operations. The BOG
made progress in strengthening its liquidity management framework, evidenced by the convergence of
the overnight interbank rate with the policy rate (Figure 4). Staff also commended the BOG for
enhancing the use of its model-based inflation forecasting tool to support Monetary Policy Committee

decisions and for reducing the gap between its transaction and interbank exchange rate and shifting
toward the latter for its own transactions.2 Staff suggested to:


Reduce direct government financing which amounted to 7½ percent of current-year revenue in 2013
(exceeding the BOG’s own target of 5 percent). Besides boosting liquidity, deficit financing raises
concerns about fiscal dominance and the credibility of the inflation-targeting framework. The BOG
agreed that it will be important to keep its deficit financing at, or below, the 5 percent target in
2014, which is comparable with provisions in other countries in the region.



Adopt a unified market-determined exchange rate: The current use of different exchange rates lacks
transparency, can create distortions, and gives rise to a multiple-currency practice. Following the
introduction of an electronic platform, the BOG is working with banks on establishing a system of
more frequent adjustments in the interbank rate to better reflect market conditions. This should
facilitate unification, while effective price discovery would be improved by allowing more foreign
exchange transactions to pass through the market.



Increase the inflation target horizon: Replacing the end-year inflation target with a rolling target, set
for a 1-2 year policy horizon, would further enhance the credibility of the IT framework. The BOG
will consider this proposal.

18.
Staff expressed reservations about some of the new foreign exchange regulations, aimed
at curbing foreign currency shortages and dollarization. The new regulations reinforce preexisting
requirements for the repatriation of export proceeds, ban foreign-currency denominated loans to nonforeign exchange earners, impose the creation of margin accounts for import bills, tighten operating
procedures for forex bureaus, and circumscribe the use of foreign exchange held in foreign currency
accounts. While noting that restrictions on foreign-currency loans have been adopted by many
countries as a macro-prudential measure to contain exposures, staff recommended a review of all
measures after an appropriate evaluation period to mitigate any unintended consequences, such as
reduced foreign exchange inflows as a result of rising transaction costs.3 The BOG agreed with this
proposal and with the need to address the root causes of current imbalances. Staff supported steps
taken by the authorities to prevent the misuse of foreign exchange bureaus for money laundering, while
arguing that de-dollarization is best achieved in a stable macroeconomic environment.

2

The BOG previously conducted all its transactions using the weighted average of reported bank-customer exchange
rates of the previous day, after discretionary removal of outliers (transaction rate). It now uses the average interbank rate
of the previous day for most of its own transactions. While this shift does not fully remove the existing multiple-currency
practice, it is a step toward its elimination.
3
The ban on foreign-currency denominated loans to non-foreign exchange earners, which includes importers,
constitutes the withdrawal of a normal, short-term banking and credit facility and gives rise to an exchange restriction.
Another exchange restriction arises from the requirement for importers to submit to their commercial bank customs
entry forms not yet submitted for any past foreign exchange transactions related to imports before foreign exchange
may be transferred abroad for any further import transaction. The BOG assured staff that it will remove both restrictions
following its planned review of the regulations in May.

C. Financial Sector: Containing Exposure to Short-Term Risks
The financial sector is adequately capitalized and liquid, but increasing exposures will need to be
monitored closely.

Stress tests conducted by the BOG based on end-2013 data point to adequate buffers in
most banks and the system in aggregate. Only one bank would have negative capital under various
stress tests, while about two-thirds of all banks (representing about two-thirds of total assets) would

Staff pointed to emerging vulnerabilities that may not be fully captured in the stress test

by a reduction in net open position limits to
5 percent of capital for single currency and 10 percent for aggregate exposure, while the BOG’s recent
ban on on-lending to non-foreign exchange earners should contain indirect exposures.
21.
The mission advised the authorities to strengthen their crisis prevention and management
capabilities. Stronger off-site supervision capabilities to complement on-site inspections are an
effective way to identify major build-up of risks. Communication with banks—especially on emergency
liquidity provision and modalities of BOG or government support—could also be improved. Staff further
encouraged the BOG to conduct contingency planning and crisis simulation exercises to help identify
gaps in the framework. Expedited completion and adoption of new banking sector legislation, drafted
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

with extensive IMF technical assistance, will be important to clarify and enhance the BOG’s powers with
respect to consolidated and cross-border supervision, as well as crisis management and resolution. A
deposit insurance act, recommended in the 2011 FSAP Update, is expected to be submitted to
parliament this year.

STAFF APPRAISAL
22.
Short-term vulnerabilities have risen significantly amid high fiscal and current account
deficits. The international reserve position has weakened alongside mounting public debt. High interest
rates and a depreciating currency have begun to depress private sector activity, and spreads on Ghana’s
Eurobonds have risen above those of regional peers.
23.
Additional measures are required to contain short-term risks and safeguard the
government’s transformation agenda. Despite significant policy efforts, the 2014 fiscal deficit of
8½ percent of GDP is unlikely to be met in the absence of further measures. Staff welcomes the
authorities’ recent policy documents. They now need to be complemented by additional short-term
measures to contain the 2014 deficit and by specific action plans to entrench significant and durable
consolidation over the medium term. Swift implementation of a strong package of policy measures is
needed to restore confidence in the government’s ability to address large imbalances and to provide
the needed space for infrastructure and social priority spending.
24.
The case for stronger consolidation is supported by staff’s external stability assessment
and debt sustainability analysis. The medium-term analysis suggests that Ghana’s real effective
exchange would be modestly overvalued without further adjustment. A model-based approach
confirms that the main part of the adjustment should come from lower public expenditure. Further
delays in fiscal consolidation would keep public debt and debt service at uncomfortably high levels.
25.
Further monetary policy tightening may be needed to tame inflationary pressures. Faced
with second-round effects of large administered price increases and a depreciating currency, the recent
hike in the policy rate and the subsequent tightening of reserve requirements may not be sufficient to
steer inflation back into the target range. The BOG should continue to manage liquidity tightly and
refrain from direct financing of the fiscal deficit. The exchange rate should be allowed to adjust to
prevent further erosion of an already low reserve buffer, and the authorities need to begin rebuilding
the buffer as market conditions permit.
26.
The new foreign exchange regulations will not be effective, unless the underlying
macroeconomic imbalances are resolved. The BOG’s agreement to review these measures with the
objective of mitigating any unintended consequences and removing the exchange restrictions is
welcome. As the restrictions are not imposed for balance of payments reasons, staff does not
recommend their approval. In preparing to move to a fully market-determined exchange rate system,
the BOG should allow more foreign exchange transactions to pass through the market.

27.
The financial sector is adequately capitalized and liquid, but increasing exposures will
need to be monitored closely. Stress tests conducted by the BOG suggest that buffers are adequate in
most banks and the system in aggregate. Nevertheless, the weaker macroeconomic outlook and
currency depreciation expose the financial sector to currency and credit risks, warranting a
strengthening of crisis prevention and management capabilities.
28.
Data provision, while broadly adequate for standard surveillance, should be strengthened.
In current circumstances, effective surveillance warrants a more timely provision of critical highfrequency data to monitor risks.
29.
It is recommended that the next Article IV Consultation be held on the regular twelvemonth cycle.

or revised

2. Sustained
decline in

(medium term).

Likelihood of Severe Realization of
Threats in the Next 1–3 Years
(high, medium or low)
Medium

Impact if Realized
(high, medium or low)
High

 The government is increasingly
relying on foreign financing of the
deficit, including Eurobonds and foreign
participation in the domestic bond
market.

 Foreign reserve cover is thin and
the current account deficit high. If
foreign outflows are larger, reserves
could be further eroded, triggering
increased exchange rate pressures.

 Staff projections assume no
issuance of another Eurobond this year
and net portfolio outflows from
maturing domestic bonds held by
foreigners. Net outflows could be larger,
however, in the event of early
redemptions.

 Significant currency depreciation
could further increase inflationary
pressures and raise the cost of foreign
debt service.

Medium
 Commodity exports account for
85 percent of total merchandize
exports. A fall in commodity prices, in
particular gold or cocoa, could result in
a sharp contraction of exports and a
further widening of the current account
deficit—though part of this would be
offset by lower profit and dividend
payments.

 Economic growth and imports
would have to decline to bring about
the required adjustment in the current
account deficit.

High
 A further increase in the current
account deficit would reduce an already
low reserve buffer, triggering increased
exchange rate pressures.
 Significant currency depreciation
could raise inflationary pressures and
the cost of foreign debt service.
Economic growth and imports would
decline.

 A drop in gold prices would also
reduce production and fiscal revenue.

3. Delayed fiscal
adjustment

High (in the absence of additional
policy measures)
 A revenue shortfall or spending
overrun (e.g., from higher wages or
interest payments) could compromise
the 2014 fiscal target, with little room
for discretionary tightening.

High
 Failure to achieve the budget
targets would prolong a situation of
high real interest rates, depreciation
pressures, and double-digit inflation.
 Debt dynamics could worsen,
reducing capacity to handle shocks and
crowding out space for infrastructure
and social priority spending.

Appendix I. Risk Assessment Matrix (concluded)

4. Further
increase in
domestic prices

Medium
 Inflationary pressures have risen
fueled by a depreciating currency and
large increases in utility tariffs.
 The planned elimination of
electricity subsidies in 2014 and a
further depreciation of the currency
could intensify inflationary pressures
and feed into inflation expectations.

34

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Medium
 Higher inflation would require a
further monetary policy tightening to
prevent second-round effects, raising
funding costs for the government.
 A generalized increase in inflation
would disproportionately affect lower
income groups.

Implementation of Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief (PCDR): Not Applicable
Decision point—point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country
qualifies for assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of assistance to be
committed.
Interim assistance—amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and
completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance committed
at the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional circumstances).
Completion point—point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its assistance
committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income as
defined in footnote 2 above. The timing of the completion point is linked to the implementation
of pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating completion point).
Safeguards Assessment
The Bank of Ghana (BoG) was subject to an update safeguards assessment with respect to the PRGF
arrangement approved on July 15, 2009; the assessment, completed on December 2, 2009, followed
an initial safeguards assessment from October 2003. The update assessment found that while the
safeguards framework of the BoG had been strengthened in several areas, new risks in governance
oversight emerged with the removal of the former Board in January 2009. In March 2010, a new
Board was appointed.
Exchange Rate Arrangement
On February 2, 1994, Ghana accepted obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4, of the
Fund’s Articles of Agreement. The exchange rate regime is classified as a managed float. Ghana
currently maintains two exchange restrictions and a multiple currency practice (MCP) subject to
Fund approval. The exchange restrictions arise from (1) the limitation/prohibition on purchasing
and transferring foreign exchange for import transactions by importers who have not submitted to
the commercial bank customs entry forms for any past foreign exchange transactions related to
imports, and which are unrelated to the underlying transaction; and (2) the prohibition for
commercial banks to grant foreign currency-denominated loans to non-foreign exchange earners
(including importers), which constitutes the withdrawal of previously existing normal, short-term
banking and credit facilities. An MCP also arises, because the BOG requires the use of its internal
rate (i.e., the previous day’s weighted average interbank exchange rate) for government transactions
and the surrender of cocoa and gold foreign exchange proceeds without having a mechanism in
place to ensure that, at the time of the transaction, this exchange rate does not differ from the rate
prevailing in the market rate (i.e., the interbank exchange rate) and the rates used by banks in their
transactions with their customers by more than 2 percent. At the end of March 2013, the average
exchange rate for transactions in the interbank market was GH¢ 2.6885 per U.S. dollar.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for standard surveillance. The
quality and timeliness of certain data need to be improved. To monitor vulnerabilities, effective
surveillance warrants a more timely provision of critical high-frequency data. There are notable
deficiencies in the dissemination of statistical information to the public, although the situation has
improved with the recurrent publication on the Bank of Ghana’s (BOG) website of the Monetary Policy
Committee Statement, Statistical Releases, and economic and financial reports since 2003.
National Accounts: Ghana compiles annual and quarterly estimates of GDP by economic activities at
current and constant (2006) prices following the System of National Accounts 1993 regularly.
Incorporation of latest/updated data sources, changes in conceptual treatment/methodologies and
rebasing of national accounts to 2006 led to a significant upward revision of the estimates of GDP
published in November 2010. In addition, Ghana Statistical Service recently published annual GDP by
expenditure estimates at current and constant (2006) prices for the years 2006-12. Private consumption
expenditure which was estimated as a residual in the old series, has been calculated directly in the
rebased series.
Ghana is one of the countries participating in the Quarterly National Accounts Module of the Enhanced
Data Dissemination Initiative (EDDI) supported by the United Kingdom Department for International
Development (DFID). Four missions have been conducted (September 2010, April 2011,
November/December 2011, and February 2013) under this project. The February 2013 mission worked
towards further improving the methodology of the current and constant price QGDP estimates by
economic activity. In addition, the methodology for each component of the published annual
expenditure estimates was scrutinized and a preliminary methodology for expanding these to quarterly
was developed. The constant price methodology has been improved by introducing forestry stock
changes and extending the range of indicators for measuring cocoa production, hotels, and air
transportation. It is expected that estimates of QGDP by expenditure will be compiled by mid-2014.
Labor statistics: The scarcity of labor statistics is a cause for concern. Labor statistics are almost
nonexistent, although some wage indicators are available from the Social Security National Insurance
Trust (SSNIT). The Ministry of Employment has been receiving technical assistance from the United
Nations Development Program and the International Labor Organization in the design and compilation
of labor statistics.
Government finance statistics: Steps have been taken to improve fiscal data. The Controller
Accountant General Department (CAGD) currently compiles monthly budget implementation reports,
and the data are available within six weeks, although some factors undermine their reliability. There is a
need for comprehensive and timely reconciliation of monthly treasury data with bank accounts. To
address these shortcomings, the government has formed a committee to define the nature of “broad”
and “narrow” government; moved to a system of immediate booking for “direct debits” and more
frequent reporting of government account balances; and is implementing a new automated Budget and
Public Expenditure Management System (BPEMS). The BPEMS covers ministries, departments, and
agencies. Several GFS missions worked with the authorities to improve the economic classification of

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GHANA

data in accordance with the requirements of GFSM 2001. In 2009, an STA mission also provided
guidance on the compilation of a partial financial balance sheet for budgetary central government, and
proposed that information on debt stocks that is available on a monthly basis be reported for the
inclusion in the International Financial Statistics (IFS).
The coverage of transactions is uneven. There are also difficulties in accounting for expenses paid by
extrabudgetary funds. The operations of special funds, such as the SSNIT (currently regarded as a public
financial corporation by the authorities), the Ghana Education Trust Fund (GETF) and the District
Assemblies Common Fund (DACF), are not yet covered in the fiscal accounts. Although the majority of
local government expenses are directly met from budgetary accounts, the revenue of local
governments and related spending, and transactions financed from the DACF are not yet covered.
Extending the coverage of fiscal data to general government is strongly encouraged.
Comprehensive solutions to some of the data problems may have to await full implementation of the
BPEMS system and incorporation of Fund technical advice. Various missions from FAD have suggested
short-term temporary solutions to alleviate current data quality problems.
Monetary and financial statistics: While BOG has made significant progress on implementing the
previous missions’ recommendations on monetary and financial statistics, continued efforts are needed
to expand the institutional coverage and improve the timeliness of the data reporting.
The June 2011 monetary and financial statistics mission assisted in improving the data mapping for
compiling the standardized report forms (SRFs) for central bank (SRF 1SR) and other depository
corporations (ODCs) (SRF 2SR). BOG has used the updated mapping to compile and report SFR 1SR,
SRF 2SR, and SRF 5SR for monetary aggregates for publication in the IMF’s International Financial
Statistics (IFS). As a result, the data quality has improved. However, data have not been reported
regularly and the timeliness has worsened. Data through October 2012 were published in the April 2013
issue of IFS—a lag of more than six months. The mission also assisted in mapping the statistical returns
for other financial institutions to SRFs with a view to expanding the data coverage. However, no further
progress has been made on including these other financial institutions in the coverage of monetary
statistics.
Debt statistics: The responsibility for external debt recording and payment is divided among three
agencies. The Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MOFEP), through its Aid and Debt
Management Unit (ADMU), maintains the external debt database. It is responsible for recording debt
payment obligations, issuing payment requests, and tracking HIPC debt relief. The CAGD confirms the
legality of the payment and authorizes the release of public funds. It is responsible for accounting for
debt payments and rendering reports to parliament. The BOG as the payment agent for the
government verifies payments made to ADMU and CAGD.
To enable systematic comparison of the budget, the balance of payments and the BOG cash-flow data,
the authorities should clearly identify the government subsectors for which data are reported and
prepare a clear classification of financing, outstanding debt, and guarantees issued.
External sector Statistics: The Balance of Payments Office (BPO) of the Research Department of the
BOG is responsible for the compilation and dissemination of balance of payments and International
Investment Position (IIP) data for Ghana. Ghana participates in the external sector module of EDDI and
has benefited extensively from technical assistance in developing and undertaking enterprise surveys of
cross-border financial flows and stocks (Foreign Assets and Liabilities Survey (FALS)), with a view to
improve the quality of balance of payments statistics and IIP statistics. A major achievement was the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

GHANA

submission of an IIP to the Fund’s Statistics Department (STA) during 2011 for the period 2006 through
2009 and the data were subsequently published in the March 2011 International Financial Statistics
(IFS). However, there are still some challenges to overcome with respect to the timeliness of the data.
Next steps are, therefore, the implementation of a small timely sample quarterly survey of cross-border
capital to overcome the timeliness and quarterly estimates challenges. Despite the progress achieved in
improving the data sources and compilation techniques, substantial work is still needed to strengthen
existing, and develop new data sources to improve the accuracy and reliability of the current and
capital, and financial account. The missions urged the BPO to work towards closing major remaining
data gaps by making the International Transactions Reporting System (ITRS) a reliable data source to
the extent possible, and use it at its full potential and as a cost-efficient way to receive information for
the current, capital, and financial account. ITRS reporting is being revised to ensure that it serves as: (i) a
broad indicator of BOP current, capital, and financial account transactions; and (ii) a data source for
transactions of which direct reporting is not feasible.
Trade statistics: Currently, the GSS is not publishing timely monthly trade statistics, although the data
are available from the Customs, Excise, and Preventive Service (CEPS). The staff has recommended that
the GSS collaborate with the CEPS to process customs data within six weeks and with the Ministry of
Trade and Industry (MOT) and the BOG to identify and reduce discrepancies in trade statistics and to
ensure that imports into bonded warehouses are not double-counted. Data collection procedures of
the CEPS need to be improved, and there is also room for improving trade volume data collected by the
CEPS through customs invoices, which would help the GSS to extract meaningful import and export unit
values. The May 2010 STA mission found that BPO treats goods that are temporarily imported into
Ghana without passing the customs authorities (i.e. not yet captured by customs) and then sold to
enterprises in the free zone as exports. This treatment would imply that free trade zones are treated as
located outside the Ghanaian economic territory, which should not be the case.
Fund staff has recommended that the GSS produce export unit values for major export commodities,
such as gold and cocoa. A high coverage of the country’s export bundle can be obtained from just
three major exports—cocoa, gold, and unwrought aluminum. In contrast, deflation of imports is likely to
require an iterative procedure to strike a balance between coverage of the index and its stability, owing
to the heterogeneity of the basket.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Participant in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since July 20, 2005.
III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
STA found some major issues in the March 2010 data for the Central Bank and the February 2010 data
for the ODCs that the authorities submitted in April 2010 for publication in the IFS. For this reason, STA
thoroughly reviewed the entire mapping of source data to the SRFs and several misclassifications were
fixed. As a result, the updating of the IFS page for Ghana was resumed in March 2011 after a long delay.
The latest data published in the IFS are for December 2010. Data for publication in the IFS on
international transactions were last reported for 2009, quarterly government finances for March 2010,
and national accounts for 1997. No quarterly balance of payments data are currently reported for
publication in the IFS. The latest available data reported for publication in the Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) are for 2009. However, these data cover only the cash revenue and expense
transactions of the budgetary central government.

Prepared by the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank1

Based on an assessment of external public debt indicators, Ghana still faces a moderate
risk of debt distress, but overall debt vulnerabilities have increased, and Ghana’s debt
service-to-revenue ratio is approaching high-risk levels. Driven by loose fiscal policy,
deteriorating financing terms and external pressures, several of Ghana’s public domestic
and external debt indicators have deteriorated. Assuming fiscal policies are implemented
as planned, total public debt is projected to hover around 55 to 60 percent of GDP, with
rising debt service absorbing more than 40 percent of government revenue in the long
run. The external debt service-to-revenue ratio temporarily breaches and subsequently
stays close to its indicative threshold in the long term. Additional consolidation measures
of about 2 percent of GDP in 2014, combined with a more ambitious medium-term
adjustment, would greatly reduce the risk of worsening debt and debt service indicators.

The projected debt
dynamics are, however, contingent on successful fiscal consolidation. The baseline assumes fiscal
consolidation that is consistent with the authorities’ 2014 nominal budget targets and stated policies, but a
more conservative growth outlook and higher interest payments. This implies a gradual reduction in the
fiscal deficit to 7½ percent of GDP in 2016, with subsequent changes driven primarily by the profile for oil
revenue.

Ghana’s external debt indicators are broadly in line with the 2013 DSA, with PV indicators
moderated by a change in the discount rate (Table 3 and Figure A1). The deterioration in the PV of debt
stock indicators compared to last year’s assessment was mitigated by an increase in the discount rate

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GHANA

Box 1. Baseline Macroeconomic Assumptions
Real GDP-growth: While still solid, real growth has declined to a projected 5½ percent in 2013, due to
disruptions in power supply from the West African Gas Pipeline in the first half of the year, crowding out
from high real interest rates, higher import costs due to the depreciation, and falling gold production related
to the drop in world prices. In 2014-15, growth is projected to remain at this more moderate level until
production from new oil fields boosts output in 2016. In the long run, real growth is assumed to stabilize at
4¾ percent, with new oil discoveries and the associated gas production implying significant upside
potential.
Inflation: Inflation overshot the end of the year target range of 9+/-2 percent (end-year CPI inflation was
13.5 percent, partly due to large increases in utility prices), and is projected to remain at this elevated level in
2014. Supported by an improvement in the policy mix, inflation is expected to decline in the medium run,
with the GDP deflator stabilizing at 6¾ percent in 2020–2033.
Government balances: The overall fiscal balance fell only slightly to an estimated 10.9 percent of GDP in
2013, with interest expenditures amounting to some 5 percent of GDP. Based on the government’s policy
pronouncements and updated macro-projections, including lower growth and higher interest rates than
assumed in the budget, the deficit is expected to stay above 10 percent of GDP in 2014 (primary deficit of
3½ percent). Increased revenues from the production of oil and further consolidation in 2015 and 2016
would balance primary expenditures and revenues in the medium to long term.
Current account balance: On the back of a higher fiscal deficit, declining gold and cocoa prices and large
oil imports due to electricity disruptions in the first half of the year, the 2013 current account deficit rose
above 13 percent of GDP. Owing to weak terms of trade, the deficit is expected to remain above 10 percent
of GDP in 2014 and elevated until 2015. With increased oil production, the deficit is projected to decline to
about 7 percent of GDP by 2017 and to fall gradually to about 4 percent of GDP in the long run, broadly in
line with its optimal level according to staff’s external balance assessment. Reserves would build up to about
4 months of imports in the long run, consistent with the government’s own medium-term target.
Financing flows: While still significant, FDI is estimated to have declined to about 7¼ percent of GDP in
2013. Driven by the discovery of new fields, FDI is projected to stay close to 7½ percent of GDP until 2018,
and then to gradually decline to 4 percent of GDP in the long run. Consistent with Ghana’s improving
income status and wealth, inflows from grants are projected to decline to less than ½ percent of GDP in the
medium to long term.

A complementary probability approach, which
assesses Ghana’s external debt sustainability based on an indicative threshold derived from Ghana’s own
institutional and growth characteristics, suggests that this breach is minor and temporary (1 year). Thus, the
breach, which could be smoothed out in the course of the next 10 years, does not warrant a change in
Ghana’s assessed risk of debt distress, but is nonetheless indicative of the longer-term perils of continued
resorting to market financing to finance recurrent fiscal deficits.
Standard stress tests
5.
Standard stress tests confirm a moderate risk of debt distress (Figure A1 and A2, Table 3A). All
three stock indicators as well as the external debt service-to-export ratio remain under their respective
thresholds even under the standardized stress tests. However, the external debt service to-revenue-ratio—
temporarily breaching its threshold level in the baseline scenario—increases to above 30 percent under the
most extreme shock which constitutes a one-time 30 percent real depreciation relative to the baseline in
2015. While having a more moderate impact, standardized shocks to non-debt creating flows, growth, or
financing conditions would also imply breaches of the debt service-to-revenue threshold.

Additional risks arise from the high level and rising trend of domestic debt, as indicated by
the total public debt dynamics (Table 4, Figure A3). Despite the upward revision in the discount rate to
5 percent, stock indicators of public debt are

Stress tests and customized scenario
7.
Fiscal policy will have to be tighter than in the past to prevent unsustainable debt dynamics
(Figure A3, Table A4). Fixing the primary balance at its 2013 level, or growth and the primary balance at 10year historical averages, confirms that the historical fiscal stance would not be sustainable in the long run;
the PV of public debt-to-GDP ratio would be quickly approaching the benchmark (set at 74 percent for
strong policy performers), and debt service would soon absorb most of revenues. Consistent with the
results of the external debt sustainability analysis, a one-time 30 percent real depreciation in 2015, relative
to the baseline, is the most extreme shock. It would set the debt service-to-revenue ratio on a rapidly
increasing path, in the absence of corrective policy measures. The standardized shock to other debt
creating flows captures contingent liabilities that could arise from SOE or other potential claims that have
not been identified. Any potential financial sector contingent liabilities would also be subsumed in such a
standardized shock. This shock would shift debt ratios upwards, but not change the dynamics.
8.
Further consolidation of about 2 percentage points of GDP in 2014, combined with a more
ambitious medium-term adjustment, would set the debt dynamics on a more favorable path
(Figure 1). The additional fiscal adjustment would set off a virtuous cycle where lower fiscal deficits and
falling interest rates would create room for higher social and infrastructure spending, a reduction in tax
rates, and a crowding in of private sector activity. As a result, growth would be higher, the public debt ratio
would decline, and debt service would fall below 30 percent of revenue in the long run.

CONCLUSIONS
9.
Ghana’s public debt situation has worsened since the last DSA. The updated assessment
suggests that the risk of distress, while remaining moderate based on an assessment of external public
debt, has increased, and Ghana’s debt service-to-revenue ratio is approaching high-risk levels. The analysis
does not include the liabilities of the central bank—some of which result from the need to sterilize
government financing operations—nor the debt of public enterprises that is not guaranteed by the
government. Hence, risks could be heightened further, as a result of these institutions’ liabilities.
10.
Robust growth and fiscal consolidation are essential to maintaining a moderate debt
distress rating. Under the baseline, which incorporates the authorities’ gradual adjustment plans together
with staff’s more conservative growth assumptions, the PV of public debt is expected to hover around a still
high level of 54 percent of GDP, and the total public debt service-to-revenue ratio is projected to increase
above 45 percent in the long run. Additional fiscal adjustment could set these indicators on a more
favorable path.
11.
The authorities agreed with the thrust of the analysis, but deemed staff’s macroeconomic
projections too pessimistic. In particular, they stressed that the growth outturn for 2013 is likely to be
revised upward and saw stronger economic growth also for 2014.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate
changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the
baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
May 7, 2014
This statement provides information on recent economic developments in Ghana that updates
information provided in the staff report issued to the Board on April 22, 2014. These
developments do not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
Data released in April reveal stronger-than-anticipated growth in 2012 and 2013. The
Ghanaian Statistical Service (GSS) released revised GDP data for the first three quarters of
2013 and preliminary data for the fourth quarter and the full year, implying an annual growth
rate of 7.1 percent. The report also presented revisions to the 2012 GDP data, with an upward
revision in growth from 7.9 to 8.8 percent. GSS attributed the revisions to more
comprehensive information received from the major data collection sources (the Ministries of
Agriculture and Fisheries and the Forestry and Minerals Commissions).
The revisions reflect a stronger performance in the first half of the year, followed by a
deceleration in the second half (albeit to a much lesser degree than suggested by the
earlier estimates). Contributions to growth of the industrial
GDP Growth, 2012-13
sector in the first and second quarter were revised to 2.4 and
(year-on-year, in percent)
6.0 percent, respectively (against -0.2 and 0.7 percent in the
Year Quarter Provisional Revised
previous estimates). The main contributors to the upward

The higher 2013 GDP figure implies somewhat lower
fiscal and current account deficits, as a share of GDP, in both 2013 and 2014 (Table 1).
Staff maintains its GDP growth estimates for 2014 unchanged at 4.8 percent, closely aligned
with the revised growth rates for the third and fourth quarters of 2013. On this basis, the 2014
overall fiscal deficit is now projected at 9.4 percent of GDP (around 0.8 percentage points
below previous projections). The medium-term outlook through 2019 remains broadly
unchanged.
The update does not alter staff’s recommendation for additional fiscal adjustment.
While the projected 2014 fiscal deficit is now closer to the government’s own target of
8.5 percent of GDP, a more ambitious and front-loaded consolidation path would generate
savings on interest payments, reduce gross financing needs, and expedite the reduction of
external vulnerabilities.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 13, 2014

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Ghana
On May 7, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Ghana.
Ghana has experienced strong and broadly inclusive growth over the past two decades, and its
medium-term prospects are supported by rising energy production. The country has
outperformed regional peers in reducing poverty, with robust democratic credentials and a
highly-rated business climate attracting significant foreign direct investment (FDI) and
supporting economic growth. Expanding energy production over the medium term has the
potential to generate new opportunities to channel resources into productive investment.
The emergence of large fiscal and external imbalances since 2012, however, has created
significant challenges. A swift return to macroeconomic stability in 2013 was thwarted by
weaker external and domestic conditions. Reflecting lower gold and cocoa exports, the current
account deficit exceeded 12 percent of GDP. While recently revised estimates point to an only
moderate slowdown in growth to about 7 percent, the fiscal deficit target of 9 percent of GDP
was missed by about 1 percentage point, despite significant policy efforts. Inflation also overshot
the 9 +/- 2 percent target range, prompting a further tightening of monetary policy in early 2014.
Ghana’ short-term economic outlook is subject to significant risks. Growth is projected to slow
to 4¾ percent in 2014, as high interest rates and a weaker currency are compressing domestic
demand. At the same time, the economy’s continued large twin deficits, and high financing
needs, leave it vulnerable to a deterioration of external conditions.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended Ghana’s strong and broadly inclusive growth and declining
poverty over the past two decades, and supported the government’s transformation agenda,
focused on economic diversification, social inclusion, and macroeconomic stability.
Directors, however, expressed concern over the emergence of significant short-term
vulnerabilities stemming from high fiscal and external current account deficits. These imbalances
make the country vulnerable to a deterioration of external conditions and are creating pressure on
interest rates and the exchange rate. If unaddressed, they risk weakening economic growth and
public debt sustainability. Directors emphasized that macroeconomic stability will need to be
restored to preserve a positive medium-term outlook.
Directors commended the authorities’ policy efforts and supported the fiscal measures in the
2014 budget. They noted however that achieving the 2014 fiscal deficit target will be
challenging, in light of high interest rates, a depreciating currency, and a possible growth
slowdown. Directors therefore urged the authorities to take additional short-term measures to
reduce the fiscal and external imbalances.
Directors welcomed the government’s recent policy documents outlining its homegrown
medium-term reform and consolidation measures. They supported the government’s intention to
rationalize public spending, lower the wage bill, restructure the statutory funds, and enhance
revenue mobilization and tax administration. They encouraged the authorities to translate their
policy commitments quickly into specific and time-bound action plans to achieve significant and
durable consolidation.
In light of current imbalances, Directors recommended a more ambitious medium-term
consolidation path to stabilize public debt and debt service at sustainable levels. While the risk of
debt distress remains moderate, Directors expressed concerns about the high debt service-torevenue ratio. A stronger medium-term adjustment could set off a virtuous cycle of lower fiscal
deficits and falling interest rates, creating space for social and infrastructure spending and
crowding-in of private sector activity.
Directors welcomed the recent monetary policy tightening. They suggested that further
tightening may be needed, in combination with fiscal consolidation, to steer inflation back into
the target range. Directors stressed that the Bank of Ghana should limit its net credit to the
government, strengthen liquidity management and the inflation forecasting framework, and
continue to allow the exchange rate to adjust to prevent further erosion of the reserve buffer.

2

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3

Directors emphasized that the new foreign exchange regulations will not be effective unless the
underlying macroeconomic imbalances are resolved. In particular, they were concerned that the
measures could have unintended adverse effects. They therefore welcomed the Bank of Ghana’s
decision to review the measures with the objective of mitigating any adverse implications and
removing the associated exchange restrictions. They also commended the Bank of Ghana for its
steps toward adopting a unified, market-based exchange rate.
Directors welcomed that the financial system is currently sound, adequately capitalized, and
liquid. They stressed the need to monitor exposures closely, noting that a weaker macroeconomic
outlook, rising interest rates, and currency depreciation expose the financial sector to credit and
currency risks. Accordingly, Directors encouraged the authorities to strengthen their crisis
prevention and management capabilities and welcomed recent actions to improve the bank
supervision framework.

Statement by Jafar Mojarrad, Executive Director for Ghana
and Philip Abradu-Otoo, Advisor to Executive Director
May 7, 2014
On behalf of the Ghanaian authorities, we would like to thank staff and management for their continued
support to Ghana. The authorities appreciate the constructive engagement and policy dialogue with
Ms. Daseking and her team during the Article IV consultation mission. They are also grateful for the
recent opening of the Fund’s AFRITAC West II regional technical assistance center in Accra, which will
help expand capacity building within the sub-region.
Overview
1.
Following the contested presidential and parliamentary elections in December 2012, the Supreme
Court declared President Mahama victorious after nine months of proceedings. This has confirmed
Ghana’s democratic credentials and helped dissipate uncertainty and lack of investor confidence during
the period.
2.
Ghana has experienced a long streak of relatively high and inclusive growth, which has helped
reduce poverty and propel the country to middle-income status. This period has also seen temporary
episodes of rising imbalances, resulting from both domestic and external factors, which were dealt with
effectively, allowing the economy to resume growth at high and sustainable rates. The economy has
entered anew into a similar episode since 2012, with widening fiscal and current account deficits,
exchange rate pressures, high inflation, and high interest rates, exacerbating the fallout from unfavorable
international environment and leading to a deceleration of growth in 2013. The authorities agree that
these imbalances must be addressed decisively to restore stability and avoid the risk of jeopardizing
Ghana’s transformation agenda. They have put forward a reform package encompassing short-term
stabilization measures and pro-growth medium-term reforms to bring about a lasting improvement in
macroeconomic performance.
3.
To further signal their commitment to addressing the current economic challenges, and show
resolve in implementing enough measures to bring the fiscal situation under control, the authorities
presented a policy statement to the legislature in early April and subsequently followed it up with a more
detailed report on Economic and Financial Policies for the Medium Term. This report was also submitted
to the Fund and other multilateral institutions and development partners. The document brings more
clarity and context to the measures that are currently being implemented to reduce imbalances, and
outlines a comprehensive medium-term stabilization and reform strategy aimed at transforming the
structure of the economy and improving its medium term prospects.
Recent Economic Developments
4.
Based on recently revised data from Ghana’s Statistical Service, growth remained strong at
7.1 percent in 2013, against 8.8 percent in 2012, as shown in Staff Buff/14/38. The growth slowdown,

2

which took place in the second half of the year, was mainly in the oil, manufacturing, construction, and
service sectors. Headline inflation increased to 13.5 percent in 2013 reflecting the pass-through of
exchange rate depreciation, and periodic adjustments to energy and utility prices under the automatic
price adjustment mechanism. Since the beginning of the year, petroleum prices have been adjusted five
times, with a cumulative increase of close to 23 percent. Looking ahead, the authorities are targeting a
growth rate of 8 percent in 2014 to be driven by gas production for improved energy supply and
increased crude oil production. Even though they recognize the downside risks from uncertain global
price conditions for cocoa and gold, high domestic interest rates, and tightening of credit conditions by
the commercial banks, they believe that staff growth projections of 4.8 percent in 2014 are on the
pessimistic side. Inflation is projected to remain above the target band of 9.5 ± 2 in 2014.
5.
Despite the introduction of fiscal adjustment measures, which include levies on imports and
profits, as well as upward adjustments of utility tariffs to eliminate subsidies, the fiscal deficit reached
10.1 percent of GDP in 2013 (revised figure), against a target of 9.0 percent, reflecting lower revenues,
which more than offset lower expenditure. Revenue underperformance was on account of shortfalls in tax
receipts resulting from lower domestic output and imports, a decline in commodity prices, and lower than
projected grants. Expenditures were lower by 1½ percent of GDP, despite higher wages and salaries and
interest payments.
6.
The external current account deficit was 12.3 percent of GDP in 2013, driven mainly by
deterioration in the terms of trade. The cedi depreciated by about 15 percent in 2013 and 18 percent in the
first quarter of 2014, and gross international reserves declined to US$ 4.7 billion at end-March 2014,
equivalent to 2.7 months of imports. With a rebound in cocoa prices in 2014, as well as the onset of the
gas processing plant in the latter part of the year, staff and the authorities expect the current account
deficit to narrow to about 10 percent of GDP in 2014.

Fiscal Policy
7.
The authorities are determined to address the large fiscal imbalance and have formulated a twopronged strategy of short-term revenue and expenditure measures, which are included in the 2014 budget,
and medium-term fiscal reforms to be deployed in the outer years. Their objective (as highlighted in their
Economic and Financial Policies for the Medium-Term document) is to gradually reduce the overall
fiscal deficit from 10.1 percent of GDP in 2013 to 8.5 percent in 2014; 7.5 percent in 2015; and further
down to 6 percent in 2016.
8.
In the short run, revenue measures introduced in the 2014 budget include an increase in the VAT
rate by 2.5 percentage points, effective January 1, 2014, with a broadening of coverage to previously
exempted activities; a change in the petroleum excise tax from specific to ad valorem basis; an increase
in the corporate income tax rate of free zone companies selling on the local market (from
8 to 25 percent); and an increase in the withholding tax on rent and commercial properties and on
management and technical services fees. In addition, the payment of VAT on non-core financial services
is expected to come into force in June 2014. These tax measures are estimated by the authorities to yield

3

additional revenue of about 2 percent of GDP in 2014. Expenditure rationalization measures include:
(i) strict adherence to the automatic price adjustment formula for petroleum and utility prices to limit
subsidies, (ii) tight budget limits on the wage bill through a freeze on net hiring in most public
institutions, along with a review of the current compensation scheme, and (iii) continuation of the policy
on the moratorium on the award of new contracts for investment projects. Moreover, as part of the
ongoing PFM reforms, all government accounts will be shifted to a new chart of accounts (COA), and
government transactions will be deployed to a GIFMIS electronic platform.
9.
Over the medium term, the authorities plan to carry out wide-ranging structural fiscal reforms to
support their medium-term fiscal consolidation objectives. These reforms will focus on strengthening the
Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA), reviewing existing tax laws; rationalizing the wage bill, pensions,
gratuities, and social security payments; carrying out a broad public sector reform with a voluntary
retirement plan. In addition, they will continue the policy of regular adjustment of fuel and utility prices
to reduce subsidies. These measures will help create fiscal space for higher capital and social
expenditure. The authorities intend to have a full quantification of these measures in due course.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
10.
Monetary policy has been kept tight and focused on anchoring inflation expectations and
improving the working of the foreign exchange market. Mindful of the inflationary impact of earlier
exchange rate depreciations and continued pass through of periodic adjustments of petroleum and utility
prices; the Bank of Ghana (BOG) has since March 2013 raised its key policy rate twice; in May 2013 by
100 basis points and in February 2014 by 200 basis points to 18 percent. In April 2014, further action was
taken to address problems of liquidity overhang in the economy and improve the supply of foreign
exchange in the market by increasing the cash reserve ratio and revising downwards the Net Open
Position (NOP) of banks. The BOG acknowledges, in its latest monetary policy committee report, that
risks to inflation have risen substantially, but expects inflation to return to within the target band of
9.5± 2 percent towards the middle of 2015. The BOG remains committed to monitor closely price
developments and take appropriate action, when necessary, to prevent high inflation from becoming
entrenched.
11.
Important steps have also been taken to unify the exchange rates in the system. In conjunction
with Reuters, the authorities have developed a foreign exchange trade reporting system to enhance
transparency in the pricing of foreign exchange in the interbank market, facilitate price discovery, and
better gauge foreign exchange liquidity. With the system in place, the multiplicity of foreign exchange
rates generated from different sources have been eliminated, and transparency has been greatly enhanced,
with market participants now able to observe traded foreign exchange rates on a real time basis. This
platform currently in use by the BOG and commercial banks is expected to be made available to
international operators by the end of the third quarter of 2014.
12.
On efforts at de-dollarizing the economy, a set of measures were announced in February 2014,
aimed primarily at re-enforcing existing rules and regulations governing the foreign exchange market and
promoting the use of the local currency as the legal tender. Specific measures included the enforcement

4

of rules on repatriation of export proceeds and documentation related to international trade, prohibition of
granting foreign currency-denominated loans or foreign currency-linked facilities to clients who do not
earn foreign exchange, banning over-the-counter dollar withdrawals from the Foreign Exchange
Accounts (FEA) and Foreign Currency Accounts (FCA), except for travel purposes, and prohibiting
issuance of cheques and cheque books drawn on the FEA and FCA. Staff and the authorities agree that
restrictions on foreign currency loans are used by many countries to contain foreign exchange exposure
and risks. The BOG will monitor closely the unintended adverse effects of these measures and review
them accordingly.
Financial Sector Issues
13.
The financial sector is adequately capitalized and liquid and recent stress tests show that banks are
well positioned to withstand the adverse effects of credit, exchange rate, and interest rate shocks. Despite
the sound position of the banks, challenges remain, which call for vigilance and action to strengthen
crisis prevention and management. First, there is the broad recognition that persistence in the current
macroeconomic imbalances and a slowdown in the economy could impair asset quality. In this regard,
developments in the banking system are being closely monitored to identify emerging risks and take
appropriate action when warranted. Second, the growth of non-bank financial institutions and changing
financial landscape has imposed supervisory challenges for the Central Bank. In response to this and to
improve on its off-site capabilities and make supervision more efficient, the supervision department, with
the help of a Fund TA, has restructured the supervision function through a division of the department into
two and a re-assignment of credit reporting, financial integrity, and consumer issues to the Financial
Stability Department. This has been complemented with recruitment of additional staff to make the
department more responsive and to strengthen off-site supervision. Third, is the challenge of drafting and
consolidating the existing Banking Act and its Amendment into a new Act that addresses
recommendations contained in the 2011 FSAP update and to support a transition to the Basle II
framework. In this area, substantial progress has been made by the authorities. A draft Banks and
Specialized Deposit-Taking Institutions Bill has recently been drafted by the Bank of Ghana with LEG
TA, reflecting proposed reforms to the existing legal framework to among others provide for (i)
regulation and supervision of banks and all other deposit-taking institutions/activities; (ii) consolidated
supervision and registration of bank holding companies; (III) provisions for dealing with unauthorized
deposit taking activities; and (iv) early intervention in and orderly resolution of distressed banks. The
authorities have also with the assistance of the German Government drafted a Deposit Protection Bill to
help build safety nets for small savers and assist in orderly resolution of distressed institutions. Both
documents have recently been exposed to stakeholders, awaiting their comments for finalization and
onward transmission to the Minister of Finance for the journey through the legislative process.
Debt sustainability
14.
While total public debt at end-December 2013 stood at 53.2 percent of GDP, the updated debt
sustainability analysis (DSA) shows moderate risk of debt distress. The authorities are aware of the risks
of a rising debt burden and have undertaken an examination of the debt portfolio and potential risks.
They believe, that debt sustainability risks will be lower going forward, taking into account their growth

5

projections, the planned fiscal adjustment, and the implementation of new debt management strategies
such as on-lending and escrow arrangements among others outlined in the Government’s medium-term
debt strategy. They are also contemplating steps to improve the debt profile by lowering short-term
issuance of debt to finance the budget to about 30 percent from 72 percent, and increase domestic longterm issuance to about 49 percent through the issuance of bonds of 3 to 7 year maturity. The authorities
are of the view that staff macroeconomic projections underlying the revised DSA are based on
pessimistic growth projections.
Governance and business environment
15.
Our authorities continue to make significant strides towards improving the business environment,
with ratings in the World Bank’s governance and business indicators well above those of peers and
regional benchmarks, as Indicated in Box 1 of the report. Their commitment, at the highest level, to
fighting corruption remains strong, and they continue implementing anti-corruption measures to enhance
governance and the rule of law. In this regard, several anti-corruption bills have been brought to
parliament, including the National Anti-corruption Action Plan and Strategy, the Anti-Money Laundering
(amendment) Bill, The Whistle Blowers (amendment) Bill, and the Right to Information Bill. The Public
Procurement Act is also being amended to enhance its ability to protect the public purse. Moreover, in the
2014 budget, funding for key governance institutions engaged in the fight of corruption have been
increased to enhance their capacity to execute their mandate and enforce all relevant laws in this area.
Conclusion
16.
In conclusion, we wish to reiterate that Ghanaian authorities are cognizant of the challenges
facing the economy and the need to quickly take bold policy actions to address current imbalances. They
are fully aware that macroeconomic and financial stability are prerequisites to achieving high and
sustained growth, and are committed to pursuing appropriate policies to attain their objectives of
economic transformation, as laid out in their medium-term reform strategy. They highly value the Fund’s
policy advice and technical assistance and look forward to continued fruitful cooperation with the Fund.
