IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with the Democratic
Republic of the Congo

On September 02, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article
IV consultation1 with the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). DRC’s macroeconomic
performance remained strong through the first half of 2015 despite a difficult external and domestic
environment. Real GDP growth in 2014 is estimated at 9.2 percent, driven by copper production and
the service sector. Year-on-year inflation stabilized at 1.0 percent at end-December 2014, on account
of a prudent fiscal stance. The fiscal position recorded a small surplus, in line with the fiscal anchor
adopted in 2009. The external current account deficit narrowed to 9.2 percent of GDP in 2014
from10.6 percent of GDP in 2013, reflecting an improvement in the terms of trade and strong exports
of mining products. Sustained inflows of foreign direct investments contributed to an overall balance
of payments surplus, despite decreasing official transfers. Nonetheless, international reserves fell in
U.S. dollar terms, stabilizing at 6.2 weeks of imports at end-2014. Although the real exchange rate
declined somewhat, competitiveness is hampered by structural bottlenecks, including a challenging
business climate and electricity shortages, which weigh on the efforts to diversify the economy and
promote inclusive growth. Furthermore, the financial position of the Central Bank of Congo (BCC)
remained fragile, undermining the conduct of monetary policy.
The medium-term outlook is favorable but subject to downside risks. Real GDP growth is projected
to remain strong at 9.2 percent in 2015—among the highest rates in the world—and average
8.4 percent in 2016–17 before stabilizing at around 6 percent in 2018–20. Inflation is targeted at
2.5 percent, as fiscal policy remains prudent. Despite a sustained projected increase in exports the
current account deficit would increase to double digits by 2018 due to rising dividend outflows and
imports. Nonetheless, the overall balance is expected to remain in surplus, but international reserves
would remain at relatively low levels in the absence of interventions by the Central Bank of Congo.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Risks to the outlook are a prolonged decline in commodity prices, a deterioration of the political
situation, and delays in implementing key revenue-raising measures. Moreover, a worsening of the
energy situation would constrain the projected sustained growth in mining production.
The authorities are urged to move swiftly to meet these challenges in order to preserve the hardwon gains and address rising inequality. In particular, they need to: (i) step up domestic revenue
mobilization, (ii) accumulate more international reserves; (iii) remove bottlenecks to private sector
activity, and (iv) strengthen governance and enhance transparency in the management of natural
resources.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They commended the authorities for
their prudent macroeconomic policies, which have supported robust economic growth and
macroeconomic stability despite the country’s fragility and limited external financial assistance.
Directors noted, however, that poverty and unemployment remain high and that stronger efforts are
needed to diversify the economy, promote inclusive growth, and improve social indicators.
To bolster private sector development and facilitate economic diversification, Directors urged the
authorities to improve the business and investment climate and take steps to ease political
uncertainty. They emphasized that restoring lasting peace in the eastern provinces will help free
government resources for spending on priority social programs, basic infrastructure, and human
capital development. They also called for steps to develop the agriculture sector.
Directors supported the authorities’ prudent fiscal stance to preserve macroeconomic stability, but
underscored the need to rebuild policy buffers given rising economic vulnerabilities. They called for
efforts to step up domestic revenue mobilization by broadening the tax base and enhancing tax
administration, and to accumulate international reserves to enhance the economy’s ability to
withstand shocks. Directors also encouraged the authorities to strengthen the budgetary process to
enhance its credibility, to contain spending pressures, particularly in the context of upcoming
elections, and to move toward the adoption of a medium-term budget framework.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors called for strengthening the central bank through a timely recapitalization and passage of
the Central Bank Law to enshrine its operational independence and accountability. This will enhance
the credibility of the central bank and, along with prudent progress on de-dollarization, improve the
effectiveness of monetary policy. Directors also supported continued progress on the rationalization
of the bank’s operating costs. Directors underscored the importance of preserving financial sector
stability and deepening financial intermediation to promote inclusive growth. They encouraged the
central bank to enhance supervision and crisis management practices, reinforce the implementation
of the regulatory framework with effective on-site inspections, and develop the financial
infrastructure. Directors noted that addressing solvency problems in the microfinance sector would
improve access to financing by small and medium enterprises.
Directors welcomed the country’s accession to full compliance status with the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative. They encouraged the authorities to further improve transparency and
governance in the natural resource sector and strengthen their oversight of state-owned enterprises
by ensuring that they publish contracts of all mining operations and sell natural resource assets
through competitive bidding. In this regard, Directors emphasized that the enactment of a new
mining code in line with international best practices should bolster the contribution of the mineral
sector to government revenue, and help mobilize resources toward development needs.
Directors commended the authorities for their efforts to provide data for surveillance and
encouraged them to allocate more resources to statistics to leverage the capacity-building assistance
provided by the Fund and development partners. It is expected that the next Article IV consultation
with the Democratic Republic of the Congo will be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. Despite DRC’s abundant natural resources and its robust growth and overall
strong macroeconomic performance of the past five years, fiscal space remains limited
and poverty widespread. While key social indicators improved, DRC will likely not
achieve any of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. Implementation of
past policy recommendations was broadly satisfactory, but progress on critical structural
reforms has stalled. DRC remains a fragile country with vulnerabilities on the rise.
Outlook and risks. The outlook is favorable but vulnerable to adverse developments in
commodity prices and spending pressures in the period leading to the 2016 presidential
elections. A low foreign exchange reserves cushion leaves the economy vulnerable to
external shocks. In addition, continued delays in adopting some economic legislations
and lingering insecurity in parts of the country are also sources of risk.
Key challenges. The main challenges in the short to medium term are to: (i) address
competing demands given the limited budget resources in 2015–16, (ii) build more
buffers to withstand possible shocks from both external and domestic sources,
(iii) diversify the economy and make it more inclusive, and (iv) maximize the benefits to
the population of natural resources exploitation.
Policy recommendations. The authorities are urged to move swiftly to meet these
challenges in order to preserve the hard-won gains and address rising inequality.
In particular, they need to: (i) step up domestic revenue mobilization, (ii) reinforce the
de-dollarization process and accumulate more international reserves; (iii) remove
bottlenecks to private sector activity, (iv) strengthen governance and enhance
transparency in the management of natural resources, and (v) implement the measures
identified in the 2014 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) aimed at promoting
both the soundness and inclusiveness of the financial system.

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO

STRONG MACROECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, BUT
HIGH VULNERABILITES
1.
DRC’s macroeconomic performance remained strong. Real gross domestic product
(GDP) growth in 2014 is estimated at 9.2 percent,3 essentially driven by copper production and
the service sector (telecommunications, trade, and transport). Year-on-year inflation stabilized at
1.0 percent at end-December 2014. The fiscal position recorded a small surplus in 2014 despite a
one percentage point of GDP increase in expenditures, driven by higher exceptional spending on
security in the context of the fiscal anchor adopted in 20094 while government revenue
(excluding grants) increased only marginally (0.4 percentage points of GDP). The external current
account deficit narrowed to 9.2 percent of GDP in 2014 from 10.6 percent of GDP in 2013,
reflecting an improvement in the terms of trade and strong mineral export volumes.5 Sustained
inflows of foreign direct investments (FDI) contributed to an overall balance of payments surplus,
despite decreasing official capital transfers. However, international reserves fell in U.S. dollar
terms (See Figure 1). The exchange rate remained relatively stable since 2010, even though the
de-jure exchange rate arrangement is floating.
2.
The financial health of the banking system seems to have improved somewhat in
2014. Average ratio of regulatory capital-to-risk-weighted assets improved slightly in 2014
as did profitability and liquidity ratios. However, the quality of the portfolio deteriorated with
non-performing loans to total gross loans increasing to 6.9 percent from 5.4 percent in 2013.
3.

3

Nonetheless, vulnerabilities remain elevated:


Weak competitiveness. While there is no sign of an exchange rate misalignment for
DRC in 2014 other indicators show that DRC’s competitiveness is impaired by
structural bottlenecks and a challenging business climate. Electricity shortages are
becoming a hindrance to economic activity, particularly mining.



Low official reserves. Official reserves declined by US$118 million in 2014 to
US$1.6 billion, enough to cover only 1.6 months of next year’s projected imports
compared with at least 11.5 months as estimated in the reserve adequacy
assessment (see Appendix III).



Central bank and financial sector vulnerabilities. The financial position of the Central
Bank of Congo (BCC) remained precarious, undermining the conduct of monetary
policy. As underscored by the 2014 FSAP, the insurance and pension systems are
also in a dire financial position, as are many microfinance institutions (MFIs).

The authorities’ estimate is 9.5 percent.

4

The fiscal anchor, adopted in the context of the 2009 Extended Credit Facility-supported program, calls for zero
financing of budget deficits from the central bank (apart from the use of counterpart funds from HIPC and MDRI).
5

In 2014, copper production and exports crossed the 1 million tons threshold, making DRC the world’s 6th largest
copper exporter. The production of gold also more than doubled.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO

4.

DRC continues to display some characteristics of fragility, such as:


Fractious political setting. The political situation remains fluid essentially because
two major opposition parties still question the legitimacy of the president following
the disputed 2011 presidential elections. These parties also declined to join the
government of national cohesion appointed last December.



Heightened political uncertainty. Seven elections at a total cost of $1.1 billion are to
be held between October 2015 and November 2016 without any clear indication of
how they will be financed.6 Mixed signals about whether the incumbent president
will abide by the term limit imposed by the Constitution are adding to the political
uncertainty. Also, a constitutionally-mandated increase in the number of provinces
from 11 to 26 enacted in May 2015 further increases uncertainty about the
electoral process.



Residual security risks. Residual rebel activities in the eastern provinces and delays
in institutional reforms, including the security sector reform (SSR)7 are making
lasting peace in the east elusive.

5.
Implementation of past policy recommendations was broadly satisfactory, but key
structural reforms continued to lag (see Appendix I). These relate to the Central Bank and the
Commercial Bank Laws, the Mining Code, the recapitalization of the BCC, and measures aimed at
enhancing transparency in the management of natural resources and strengthening the
corporate governance and accountability of major state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Similarly,
reforms to strengthen financial stability, banking supervision, and resolution of financial crises
made little progress (see Table 8).

A PROMISING BUT RISKY OUTLOOK
6.
The medium-term outlook is favorable. Real GDP growth is projected to remain
strong at 9.2 percent in 2015—among the highest rates in the world—and average 8.4 percent in
2016–17 before stabilizing at around 6 percent in 2018–20. This projected growth path is
predicated on a continued dynamism of the primary and tertiary sectors. Inflation is targeted at
2.5 percent, as fiscal policy remains prudent throughout the projection period. Despite a
sustained increase in exports boosted by production of new copper mines (Sicomines) and gold,
the current account deficit would increase to double digits by 2018 due to rising dividend
outflows and imports. Even though the overall balance is expected to remain in surplus,
international reserves would decline in the absence of interventions by the BCC.

6

The Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI) estimates the funds needed for the elections in 2015 at
$397 million against $247 million budgeted.
7

Essentially under the Addis Ababa Peace, Security, and Cooperation Framework for the DRC, signed in
February 2013 by the UN Secretary General and 11 African heads of state aimed at fostering sustained peace.

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO

7.
This positive outlook is subject to a number of downside risks. These include: (i) a
prolonged decline in commodity prices, (ii) deterioration of the political situation, and (iii) delays
in implementing the revenue-raising measures8 combined with failure to contain spending
pressures in the electoral context (see Table 9). The materialization of these risks would lead to
slower overall growth, macroeconomic instability, and a significant drop in the level of official
foreign exchange reserves. In particular, a significant slowdown in China could negatively affect
copper prices9 and export earnings, lead to sustained lower fiscal revenues, and undermine
macroeconomic stability and the poverty reduction efforts. The uncertainty related to the
upcoming elections in 2015–16 is already causing a wait-and-see attitude among investors.
Authorities’ Views
8.
The authorities broadly agreed with the outlook and characterization of risks.
They projected near-term growth in line with staff projection, but are more optimistic about the
medium term. They saw DRC as vulnerable to adverse shocks and expressed concern about the
energy sector bottlenecks. They also acknowledged that a lack of progress in de-dollarizing the
economy could intensify vulnerabilities in the financial sector. The authorities also underscored
that security risks have not totally abated and could weigh in on economic activity in the affected

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Despite abundant natural resources and a robust macroeconomic performance in recent years, fiscal
space remains limited and poverty widespread. The natural resource sector, particularly mining, has
been the main driver of economic growth, which has so far not been inclusive. Against this backdrop,
policy discussions focused on how to: (i) address competing demands stemming from election financing
on limited budget resources in 2015–16, (ii) build more buffers to withstand possible shocks from both
external and domestic sources; (iii) remove bottlenecks to private sector activity, and (iv) optimally
exploit natural resources to increase the benefits to the population.

A. Building Resilience and Addressing Inequality
9.
Policy buffers are presently insufficient given DRC’s vulnerabilities and the
prospects of adverse commodity price developments. While macroeconomic performance
remained strong over the past years, the hard-won gains could be reversed in the event of
significant negative shocks to copper prices. The resulting deterioration in fiscal performance
would make adherence to the fiscal anchor strenuous. Also, the high dollarization of the
economy constrains the effectiveness of monetary policy and hampers banks’ liquidity
management. Furthermore, the low level of international reserves limits the BCC’s ability to
respond in case of a sharp depreciation of the exchange rate.
10.
A faster reserve accumulation is needed to withstand shocks. Given the significant
shortfall in DRC’s reserve holdings (see ¶3), staff recommended that the BCC accumulate more
international reserves through active interventions in the foreign exchange market and be
prepared to sterilize its purchases to limit the pass through to inflation. Staff encouraged a rapid
recapitalization of the BCC, which together with the medium-term de-dollarization strategy
adopted by the authorities will extend the reach of monetary policy and its effectiveness, and
strengthen its lender of last resort function. It stressed, however, that success of the dedollarization strategy is a long-term process requiring a stable macroeconomic environment, a
credible central bank, effective banking supervision, and a sufficiently developed financial
infrastructure.
11.
Strong macroeconomic performance, but weak social indicators and high
inequality. DRC’s strong growth over the past several years did not lead to significant job
creation; poverty remains pervasive and unemployment is high,10 particularly among the youth
(see Box 1). Although social indicators related education, health, access to water, and infant
mortality have improved in recent years, DRC will likely not achieve any of the MDGs by 2015.
Development of non-mining activities necessary to promote inclusion is hampered by structural
bottlenecks and a challenging business climate. The World Bank Doing Business 2015 Report
ranks DRC 184th (out of 189 countries), worse than most peer countries in the region
10

The authorities’ recent data shows unemployment declined from a high of 60.8 in 2009 to 43 percent in 2014.

(Text Table 1).11 The most recent Human Development Indicator shows that DRC has the highest
percentage of its population living on less than $1.25 a day when ranked among its neighbors in
the Great Lakes Region (Text Table 2).
Text Table 1. Ease of Doing Business Ranking,
Selected African Countries

Text Table 2. Human Development Index, Selected
African Countries

12.
Diversification of the economy is a prerequisite to promote more inclusive growth.
Economic diversification in the DRC lags behind compared to other sub-Saharan African (SSA)
economies (see Box 2). Staff urged the authorities to accelerate the needed reforms to promote
economic diversification and sustain the ongoing structural transformation. In particular,
measures aimed at improving the business climate should be implemented to enhance the
private sector’s role in growing the economy. These include simplification of: (i) the tax system to
support higher non-mineral activity and promote inclusive growth, (ii) the regulation for granting
construction permits and transfer of ownership, and (iii) facilitating access to credit while
enforcing contracts. Government expenditures should be prioritized in favor of basic
infrastructure, the agriculture sector where labor is intensive, and improving human capital.
Authorities‘ Views
13.
The authorities recognized the need to build policy buffers, but expressed concerns
about the impact of a gradual depreciation of the currency on inflation as inflationary
expectations could easily be rekindled given that memories of hyperinflation are still fresh.
They pointed to some progress made in improving the business climate, particularly in the areas
of starting a business and dealing with construction permits and legislations recently enacted,12
11

As pointed out in an independent evaluation of the Doing Business survey (see
www.worldbank.org/ieg/doingbusiness), care should be exercised when interpreting these indicators given
subjective interpretation, limited coverage of business constraints, and a small number of informants, which tend
to overstate the indicators' coverage and explanatory power.

A new Insurance Code and a law on leasing were adopted in March 2015, as was the Hydrocarbon Law in
June 2015.

while recognizing that their efforts to promote private sector development are hindered by
electricity bottlenecks. The authorities noted that the recent improvement in social indicators was
the direct result of increased budget allocations to the education and health sectors and
expressed optimism about the potential to develop agriculture based agro-industrial parks.13
They have liberalized the energy sector to allow production by independent power producers
and are seeking financing for investments in power generation and transmission.

B. Increasing Fiscal Space and Enhancing Budget Credibility and
Monitoring
14.
Despite robust GDP growth and abundant natural resources, fiscal space remains
too narrow and shrinking. DRC has one of the lowest revenue-to-GDP ratios in SSA as the
natural resource sector, particularly mining, has not contributed its fair share through 2014
(see Box 3). Domestic revenue

provinces present short-term trade-offs
and may crowd out spending on priority social programs and infrastructure projects, which are
essential to promote more inclusive growth. Spending pressures for electoral politicking may
affect the quality of public spending.
15.
Stepping up domestic resource mobilization is critical. Increasing fiscal space will
preserve the level of investments in basic infrastructure and priority social sectors and still ensure
adequate financing of the elections. Efforts to increase revenues in the short term should start
with improving the performance of the VAT, which deteriorated from 4.5 percent of GDP in 2012
to 2.9 percent of GDP in 2014. The administration of the VAT must be strengthened by the
effective application of existing standard procedural rules, as well as by the modernization and
simplification of procedures. Risk-based tax audits would allow better control of VAT credits and

accelerate legitimate refunds. Staff urged the authorities to adhere to the fiscal anchor,14 given
the political context and implement the measures included in the 2015 Finance Act aimed at
aligning the current taxable customs values of petroleum products with their market values.
It also recommended swift passage of a new mining code, strengthening oversight of SOEs, and
implementing targeted anti-money laundering measures to optimize revenues from the natural
resources sector.
16.
Budget credibility is low. The large gap between actual and forecasted revenue and
expenditures weakens the credibility of the budget (see Box 4 and Figure 2). Over the past five
years, frequent budget overruns in some areas and revenue shortfalls have resulted in ad-hoc
adjustments to spending in other areas and therefore in significant fluctuations of budget
execution rates. The resulting reprioritization of expenditures by the executive branch without
the legislative branch’s approval through supplementary budgets as provided by the Public
Finance Law, undermines the latter’s role in the budget process.
17.
Realistic resources projections are essential for budget credibility. To minimize the
risk of discrepancy between projections and outcomes, it is necessary to use past outturns as a
basis for budget projections. Use of supplementary budgets is also a means to strengthen the
credibility of the budget

18.
An alternative scenario with better outcomes. The main assumptions are that the
authorities adopt staff policy advice, implement TA recommendations,15 and accelerate the
stalled structural reforms, particularly the reforms of the central bank (expected to be
completed by 2016). Under this scenario, growth would be higher, averaging about 9 percent
during 2015–19 compared to 8 percent in the baseline; inflation is targeted to average

2.9 percent against 2.2 percent in the baseline and the exchange rate to depreciate gradually.
The external current account improves, averaging 8 percent of GDP during 2015–19 against
9 percent of GDP in the baseline. A gradual depreciation of the exchange rate would allow for
the much-needed reserves accumulation to increase resilience (Figure 2 and Table 5).
The significant improvement in the revenue-to-GDP ratio is predicated on a steadfast
implementation of recent the Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) TA recommendations, namely
(i) broadening the tax base, (ii) introducing e-procedures beginning with the VAT at the large
taxpayer office, and (iii) developing risk-based compliance program for large- and medium-sized
businesses.
Authorities’ Views
19.
The authorities broadly shared staff’s assessment of the potential for revenue generation
over the medium term. For the short term, they pointed to the weakness and governance
problems plaguing the revenue administration and noncompliance by some taxpayers.
They noted the recent progress made in implementing the recommendations of the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI)16 and the National Conferences on Mineral Resources
Management that would improve revenue from the sector. The authorities concurred with Staff’s
views on the need to strengthen budget credibility by improving resources forecasts. They
indicated that the budget allocations are based on the priorities of the PRSP. In addition, they
emphasized that the medium-term expenditure framework is being strengthened. To this end,
they are finalizing a decree on Fiscal Governance in the DRC that will be adopted soon.
They underscored that efforts are being made by the CENI to reduce the cost of the elections to
lessen pressures on the budget and, in this regard, may submit a supplementary budget to
Parliament.

C. Strengthening the Central Bank and Promoting Financial Sector
Stability and Inclusion
20.
The development of an efficient monetary policy operational framework has been
hampered by a number of factors. These include: (i) high dollarization of the economy; (ii) the
weak financial position of the central bank; and (iii) capacity constraints. Furthermore, the lack of
instruments and the high dollarization are also important limitations to the BCC’s ability to steer
domestic currency short-term rates. In addition, the absence of an active money market in both
dollar and domestic currency severely undermines the transmission mechanism of monetary
policy. Although the BCC strived to enhance staff technical qualifications on financial issues,
capacity remains limited.
21.
Strengthening the financial and operational autonomy of the BCC is essential.
Staff urged the authorities to: (i) finalize the BCC recapitalization process as soon as possible;
(ii) adopt the draft legislation on the statute of the BCC to enshrine its independence while
strengthening accountability; and (iii) apply the terms of 2011 agreement17 on the rate of interest
on securitized receivables of the state held by the BCC. It noted the commitment of the BCC to
disengage from the hospital before the end of 2015 and encouraged it to continue its efforts to
reduce its operating costs.
22.
Financial intermediation, access, and market depth are limited. As underlined in the
2014 FSAP, financial deepening requires important structural reforms. These include enhancing
supervision and strengthening crisis management practices, and improving the auditing and
availability of credit information. Access to financial services compares poorly with peer
countries.18 Furthermore, the limited role of microfinance institutions, a large part of which suffer
from solvency problems and lack of capital, impairs access by small and medium enterprises
(SMEs).
23.
The stability of the financial sector must be strengthened to limit its exposure to
shocks. The 2014 evaluation report on the stability of the financial sector has indeed shown that
the financial system is particularly vulnerable to shocks, the lack of a risk-based supervision,
inadequate regulation and a lack of rigor in the application of the monitoring device. In line with
the main findings of the 2014 report evaluating the stability of the financial sector, the mission
recommended to: (i) adopt the Commercial Bank Law; (ii) implement a risk-based monitoring;
(iii) strengthen the workforce and the training of supervisors; and (iv) finalize the guidelines for
the strengthening of regulations on provisioning and classification of non-performing loans.

17

In the context of a partial recapitalization of the BCC in 2011, it was agreed that the interest will be set by
mutual agreement between the Treasury and the BCC.

18

Credit to the private sector is well below the average for SSA’s resource-rich countries despite the recent
acceleration.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO

24.
Increasing access to financial services is necessary for inclusive growth. The benefits
of financial inclusion are numerous and known. For households, access to financial services
facilitates the accumulation of assets, risk management and consumption smoothing. For small
and medium enterprises, financial inclusion is associated with an increase in investment,
innovation and job creation. Staff encouraged the authorities to: (i) develop the financial
infrastructure through the payment systems, making operational the new credit registry,
increasing information on borrowers by setting up a credit bureau; (ii) support the reduction of
costs of opening and managing accounts; and (iii) make the most of the opportunities offered by
the development of new information and communications technology. Staff welcomed the
adoption of the insurance code and called for its timely implementation to promote access to
credit.
Authorities’ Views
25.
The authorities agreed on the need to strengthen the central bank. They concurred
with the staff’s view on the urgency of enhancing the credibility of the BCC. They indicated that
its recapitalization should be accompanied by a plan to cut its operating costs and improve its
governance. Against the backdrop of low aggregate credit and deposit levels—six and nine
percent in terms of GDP, respectively—the authorities also recognized the importance of
increasing access to finance. To this end, a new foreign exchange swap facility—arranged with
the International Finance Corporation—was implemented to enhance financing. Furthermore,
building on TA provided by the Fund, the authorities are focusing on: (i) enhancing consumer
protection and mobile banking and (ii) strengthening the financial stability framework by
reinforcing the work on de-dollarization of the economy and banking supervision.

OTHER ISSUES
26.
The DRC’s risk of debt distress remains moderate as in the 2014 debt sustainability
analysis (DSA). However, the DRC will need to continue its prudent policy and borrow mainly on
concessional terms while strengthening its debt management capacity (see DSA).
27.
Data quality needs to be improved. DRC’s data has some shortcomings but is broadly
adequate for surveillance purposes. Staff urged the authorities to further strengthen capacity in
data compilation, handling and, also, on capacities to perform statistical analysis. Staff also
suggested the authorities to provide greater financial autonomy to the National Statistical
Agency (INS).
Authorities’ views
28.
The authorities agreed with the staff assessment but stressed that progress is being
implemented in this area. They mentioned plans to improve collaboration across ministries and
with the BCC and INS to produce more reliable data. The authorities welcomed the technical
assistance provided in all these areas and, in particular, on national accounts statistics.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO

STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
After years of high growth rates and a stable macroeconomic environment, the
DRC is now at a crossroads. Staff commends the authorities for their steadfast pursuit of
prudent macroeconomic policies, which was instrumental in the attainment of macroeconomic
stability in DRC. It is noteworthy that such a performance was achieved despite DRC’s fragility
and limited external financial assistance. However, there is no room for complacency given
looming vulnerabilities and the unsettled political and security situation. The prevailing pervasive
poverty and high inequality calls for stronger efforts to diversify the economy, promote inclusive
growth, and improve the social indicators.
30.
The political and security situation remains challenging. DRC continues to exhibit the
characteristics of a fragile state, which are exacerbating long standing vulnerabilities. Restoring
lasting peace in the eastern provinces would help crowd in government expenditure for social
sectors and infrastructure to support job creation. It is therefore important that the institutional
reforms under the Addis Ababa Peace, Security, and Cooperation Framework, including the SSR
be accelerated. Removing the political uncertainty related to the elections would help restore
confidence of private investors.
31.
There is an urgent need to rebuild policy buffers and enhance domestic revenue
mobilization. The authorities are to be commended for pursing prudent fiscal policy despite a
difficult environment. Their continued commitment to the fiscal anchor calls for the creation of
more fiscal space in the short term to ease the expenditure trade-offs, while financing of the
elections. They need to move expeditiously to implement the revenue-enhancing measures
identified by Fund TA missions, build up international reserves, and improve budget credibility.
32.
Strengthening of the central bank should not be delayed any further.
Recapitalization of the BCC and passage of the Central Bank Law need to move forward to
enable the central bank to fulfill its mandate. Putting the BCC on a sound financial footing while
increasing its accountability will enhance its credibility and improve the effectiveness of monetary
policy. At the same, the BCC should focus on its core activities. In this regard, the planned
divestiture from the hospital is noted and should be accompanied by a rationalization of the
BCC’s operating costs.
33.
Promoting financial sector stability and development while improving inclusion will
go a long way in sustaining strong economic growth. Enhancing supervision and crisis
management practices, and improving auditing and availability of credit information could help
expand financial deepening. Furthermore, the solvency problems and lack of capital of MFIs
should be addressed to improve access by SMEs to financial services. It is also critical to reinforce
implementation of the regulatory framework with effective on-site inspections; promote financial
inclusion, and facilitate access to financial services.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO

34.
Enhancing transparency and good governance in the mineral resource sector is
critical for harnessing these resources for DRC development. The authorities are to be
commended for the recent made progress in transparency of its extractive industries. Further
measures are needed to strengthen the government’s oversight of the SOEs and ensure that they
comply with the obligations to publish contracts of all mining operations and resort to
competitive biddings when natural resource assets are sold. Enactment of a new mining code
aligned with international best practices should lead to a higher contribution from the mining
sector to government revenue.
35.
Data quality needs improvement. Staff commends the authorities for regularly
providing data broadly adequate for surveillance. It is imperative that the lack of resources for
the production of key statistical data receives immediate attention. The authorities are
encouraged to allocate more resources to statistics and leverage the capacity building assistance
being provided by the Fund and other development partners for better outcomes.
36.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with the DRC be held on the
standard 12-month consultation cycle.

While social indicators also improved, none
of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will be achieved by 2015. Health indicators improved
significantly during the last decade. Life expectancy, which had decreased to 46.3 years by 2000, rose to
51.7 years in 2013, while the rate of child mortality decreased by 30 percent between 2007 and 2012.
Progress was also made in the fight against communicable diseases and neo-natal care. However,
geographical access and affordability continue to pose major obstacles to the delivery of health services.
Progress was more significant in education with most indicators doubling between 2002 and 2012. Access to
primary school is now quasi universal and exceeds the SSA average. Better quality in teaching, reduced
inequities in access and achievements between social groups and also between genders are the next
challenge.
Commitments from the authorities and
support from donors have been decisive in
education and health. Given the rapid
population growth, continuous investments
and spending in the sector combined with
enhanced management, better traceability,
and accountability will be needed.

Box 2. Growth, Structural Transformation, and Export Diversification
While natural resources have delivered strong economic growth over recent years, the DRC faces
challenges regarding export diversification. While manufacturing—mainly, mining activities—is of great
significance to the development of the country, the value added of the service sector is essential to promote
higher growth. The leading component of this sector is trade and commerce, which are indirectly linked to
the mining activities mainly in the copper and zinc industries. DRC has maintained a steady sectoral share in
the last decade, but has lagged behind the average of SSA countries in terms of its manufacturing and
services as a share of GDP. Structural changes that followed after 2004 gradually brought the country to a
much more favorable position today. However, DRC’s diversification has lagged vis-à-vis comparators in
SSA because exports are concentrated on minerals, even though overall export diversification and product
exports moved slightly upwards, based on exports of new minerals in the last decade.
Factor productivity could be enhanced to achieve higher growth rates. Growth decomposition shows

could yield growth gains. Based on the estimates in IMF (2014a), a one standard deviation increase in LIC’s
export diversification raises the growth rate by about 0.8 percentage points.1 For the DRC, this translates
into estimated growth gains of 0.2 percentage points if export diversification was raised to levels observed
in comparators like Vietnam. Developing human capital could also have a significant effect on DRC’s growth
rates. Improving infrastructure and trade networks, reducing barriers to entry for new products, and
deepening financial markets would accelerate economic diversification

Box 3. Contribution of the Natural Resources Sector to the Congolese Economy
The mining sector’s contribution to real
GDP growth has been strong starting in
2010. The mining code adopted in 2002 fueled
steady inflows of foreign direct investments
and a shift from artisanal mining to industrial
production. DRC became the fifth largest
producer of copper in the world in 2014 with
1.065 million tons produced. The sector now
generates around one fifth of GDP and has
accounted for one third of the growth recorded
since 2004. Despite the recent adverse price
developments and prospects, mineral
production is expected to increase over the
medium term as new mines enter production
stage.

However, spillovers to other sectors of the economy remain limited, especially on government
revenue and employment. The mining industry largely operates as an enclave within the economy with
little spillovers to other sectors. Direct employment from the formal sector represents less than 0.5 percent
of the labor force in the DRC, reflecting its capital intensive nature. Due to the generous provisions of the
2002 mining code and weaknesses in revenue administration, payments to the public sector were estimated
at only 3.8% of GDP in 2012.
The contribution of the mining sector to public finances started to increase, but would benefit from

corporate governance of the SOEs should be strengthened and a transparent dividend policy put in place.
A revision of the mining code is key to further improve the revenue profile from the mining sector.
Ongoing discussions on a new mining code seek to address the limitations of the 2002 mining mode with a
view to increasing government revenue without jeopardizing the profitability of new projects.
Implementation of the FARI model provided to the authorities through technical assistance from the IMF is
expected boost revenue from the sector. Increasing local value added in the production process represents
another policy objective worth pursuing.

Box 4. Strengthening Budget Credibility and Monitoring Budget
Wide differences between actual and forecasted resources undermine budget credibility for a number
of reasons. First, taxes not collected mean that some expenditure will not take place, which directly
undermines budget credibility. Second, shortfalls in budgeted resources lead to ad hoc re-prioritizing and
re-allocating of resources by the executive branch, thus reducing the Parliament’s role in the budget
process. Third, the government seldom sends supplementary budget to Parliament.
There is a significant difference between budgeted resources and outcomes. The gap fluctuated
between 48.6 to 71.9 percent over the past 5 years mostly on account of external resources, which fluctuated
between 15 to 50 percent (see Figure 2). Both the grants and loans components of external financing have
contributed to these outcomes. This calls into question the realism on the part of the authorities and foreign
donors, the absorptive capacity, and the lack information sharing.
Difference between domestic revenue forecasted and outturns also contribute to the volatility in
budget execution. This is so because tax and non-tax revenue projections are based not on previous years’
revenue outturns, but on budget projections. The result is that budget execution outturns have been on
average 45 percent lower than initial projections, undermining budget credibility. It is therefore important a
link be established between previous year’s outturns and current year projections during the budget
preparation process.

accounts), are the driving forces behind this progress.
Despite this recent progress, financial inclusion in DRC remains low compared to regional peers in the
Southern African Development Community (SADC). According to the 2014 FinScope Survey, the DRC has
the lowest inclusion financial levels in the SADC region. Individuals at the bottom of the income distribution
are the most financially excluded, in particular people making a living in farming activities.
Firms in DRC are also excluded. According to the World Bank Enterprise Survey, about 43 percent of
enterprises in the DRC do not have a checking or savings account in 2013 as compared to an average of
13 percent for sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). More than 90 percent of enterprises in the DRC do not have a loan or
line of credit, against 77 percent in SSA.
Financial literacy, income levels, and lack of trust in financial institutions are the main barriers to
financial inclusion for households. The lack of access to financial services for firms is explained by the
financial infrastructure gap and by weak judiciary and legal systems.
Policy measures to foster financial inclusion in the DRC include among others: (i) filling the infrastructure
information gap, (ii) providing flexible regulatory environment to encourage the development of technologybased financial services, (iii) restructuring and strengthening the oversight of the MFIs, and (iv) promoting
contractual savings. In addition, the authorities need to step up efforts to make government payments and
collect taxes through financial institutions and fully exploit the mobile banking potential.

Including interest due to the IMF.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view
of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a
probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM
reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive
risks may interact and materialize jointly. “Short term” and “medium term” are meant to indicate that the risk could materialize within 1 year and
3 years, respectively.

Appendix I. Implementation of Past IMF Recommendations
1.
Implementation of past policy recommendations was broadly satisfactory.
The authorities steadfastly adhered to the fiscal anchor, which has been instrumental in keeping
inflation low. They continued to allocate more budgetary resources to education, health,
infrastructure, and agriculture. Also, measures were taken to improve the business climate, but
these did not translate in an improvement in DRC’s ranking in the 2015 doing business ranking
and the business climate remains challenging. Progress continued to lag in the implementation
of structural reforms, including in the natural resource sector, recapitalizing the Central bank of
Congo (BCC), and passing key economic bills.

Appendix II. Alternative Scenario
1.
The main assumptions underlying the alternative scenario are that the authorities
adopt staff policy advice, implement technical assistance recommendations, and
accelerate the stalled structural reforms, particularly the reforms of the central bank
(expected to be completed by 2016). Under this scenario, growth would be higher and
relatively more inclusive with relatively stronger contribution from the non-mining sector.
Inflation is targeted to average 2.9 percent over the medium term against 2.2 percent in the
baseline and the exchange rate to depreciate gradually. The revenue-to-GDP ratio increases
from 13.3 percent in 2014 to 17.4 percent by 2019; and the external current account deficit,
including grants narrows to single digit by 2019 (7.5 percent of GDP against 10.1 percent of
GDP in the baseline). The gradual depreciation of the exchange rate would allow some build up
of international reserves, making the economy more resilient to external shocks (Figure 2 and
Table 5).
2.
The improvement in the revenue-to-GDP ratio is predicated on a steadfast
implementation of recent FAD TA recommendations (broadening the tax base,
introducing e-procedures beginning with the VAT at the large taxpayer office, and
developing risk-based compliance program for large and medium-sized businesses).
Together with a prioritization of expenditures and improvement in the efficiency of spending,
the fiscal space created will allow to cover the cost of financing the elections in the 2016 budget
($889 million) while devoting more resources to key infrastructure projects and priority social
spending in health and education.
3.
The alternative scenario is subject to a number of specific downside risks,
including: (i) inaction by the authorities on the key reforms and on the implementation of
the TA recommendations ahead of the elections, and (ii) a higher-than-targeted inflation
rate, given the history of hyperinflation.

Appendix III. External Sustainability Assessment
1.
Developments in the balance of payments position remain consistent with external
stability. The real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with macroeconomic fundamentals.
Nevertheless, the DRC’s competitiveness suffers from institutional constraints, lack of basic
infrastructure, and a weak business environment. Against this backdrop, international reserves
could be strengthened to protect the economy against potential shocks.1
2.
Spurred by increasing mineral
exports, the current account has been
improving in recent years (Table 1).
In 2014 the current account deficit reached
9.2 percent of GDP and is projected at
7.6 percent of the GDP in 2015 (baseline
scenario). The balance of goods has been
continuously positive since 2009, but the
DRC remains a net importer of services
(see Figure I.1). Moreover, the repatriation of
profits by foreign companies operating in
the natural resources sector lead to a
negative primary income balance.

3.
The two approaches of the Consultative Group on Exchange Rate (CGER)
methodology used to evaluate the REER indicate no major misalignment. Both the
macroeconomic balance and the external stability balance approaches calculate the exchange
rate misalignment as a percent change in the real exchange rate that is needed to close the gap
between a current account norm and the underlying current account i.e., the current account
balance projected over the medium term at prevailing exchange rates, calculated on a set of
fundamental variables, including the fiscal balance, population growth, net foreign assets,
GDP values, and FDI. In particular,


Macroeconomic balance approach: the current account norm is estimated
through the projected values of medium-term fundamentals. This norm is
estimated to lie between -5.8 and -8.2 percent of GDP based on coefficients
estimated by Vitek (2013).2 Assuming an elasticity of the trade balance with respect
to the real exchange rate of 0.7,3 the difference between the underlying current
account and the current account norm indicates a REER negligible misalignment

1

The real effective exchange rate assessment should be interpreted cautiously due to data limitation and the
high dollarization of the economy but the REER seems to be broadly in line with the fundamentals.

between 0.6 and 0 percent. A use of the CGER elasticity of the current account
would imply a REER misalignment between 1.4 and 0.1 percent of GDP.


External sustainability approach: the current account norm is defined as the
balance that would stabilize net foreign assets (NFA). The exchange rate
misalignment is then equal to the adjustment necessary to bring the underlying
current account to a level stabilizing the NFA. The current account balance
necessary to stabilize the DRC’s NFA-to-GDP ratio at its 2020 level is estimated to
be -6.8 percent compared with an underlying current account of -7.8 percent,
implying an overvaluation of 0.2 percent.

4.
The DRC’s competitiveness is impaired by structural bottlenecks and a challenging
business climate. The 2015 Doing Business report ranks DRC 184th (out of 189 countries).
Electricity shortages are among the key concerns among the business community. The 2015
Doing Business report ranks DRC 184th (out of 189 countries), worse than most peer countries
in the region, stressing the administrative
complexities, low access to finance, and
inefficient tax policy. In this regard, the lack
of progress on credit information and a
weak judiciary system limit the capacity of
the financial sector to develop and
contribute to economic growth. The 2013
Human Development Index of the United
Nations Development Program ranked DRC
186th out of 187 countries and territories
listed.
5.
DRC holding of international
reserves could become insufficient to
cushion the impact of external shocks.
Given the fact that total U.S. dollar deposits in the banking system are currently larger than
gross reserves and the volatility of commodity prices, DRC should hold gross reserves equivalent
to at least 7.7 months of imports for a cost of holding reserves of 5 percent,4 against an actual
1.8 months (see Figure III.3 and III.4).5

4

The reserve coverage should represent up to 14.3 months of next year imports for a cost of holding reserves of
2 percent.
5

The methodology balances the risk-reducing effects of reserves against their carrying costs. It estimates both
the likelihood and the scale of a drop in domestic demand in a country and compares the benefits of holding
additional reserves (which helps containing demand declines) with the costs of holding additional reserves
(revenues foregone by investing in liquid and thus lower yielding foreign assets).

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

Approved By
Michael Atingi-Ego and
Ranil Salgado (IMF) and
John Panzer (IDA)

Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary
Fund and the International Development Association.19

Stable macroeconomic fundamentals, prudent fiscal policy, and a strong export
performance despite falling commodity prices result in the assessment that the
Democratic Republic of the Congo’s (DRC) risk of debt distress remains “moderate”.
However, the country is still highly vulnerable to shocks, in particular to its export
revenues. Staff recommended that the authorities continue in their cautious
approach to borrowing, relying mainly on concessional borrowing, and that the DRC
strengthen its debt management capacity.

19

This DSA was prepared by International Monetary Fund (IMF) staff with input from the World
Bank, using the standard debt sustainability framework for low-income countries (LIC-DSA); see
“Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Framework
for Low-Income Countries.”

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO

BACKGROUND
1.
The DRC’s external debt has remained low following the substantial debt relief in
2010. The DRC reached completion point under the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) initiative and benefited from assistance under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI)
in July 2010. As a result, the ratio of public and publicly-guaranteed external debt (PPGE) to GDP
was reduced from 75 percent at end-2009 to 22 percent in 2010 and fell further to 13 percent in
2014. Private external debt increased marginally from 2.0 percent of GDP in 2012 to 3.8 percent
in 2014.
2.
The low debt stock reflects a prudent fiscal stance pursued since 2010 and
favorable exchange rate movements. . New disbursements to the central government during
2014 were limited to US$115 million. Also, the appreciation of the US dollar against the Euro
contributed to a slight reduction in the value of Euro denominated debt. Furthermore, lower
disbursements under the Sino-Congolese Mining Agreement (SCCA or Sicomines) due to delays
in obtaining financing from Chinese banks also contributed to the low stock of debt. No new
funds were disbursed for infrastructure projects under the SCCA in 2014 (see Box 1).
3.
More than half of the public external debt is owed to official creditors. At end-2014,
60 percent of the debt was owed to multilateral creditors and 4 percent to the bilateral official
creditors. The share of the debt owed to commercial creditors increased marginally in 2014 to
36 percent from 33 percent in 2013 (see Text Table II.1).

Box 1. The Sino-Congolese Joint Venture (Sicomines)
In April 2008, the DRC signed a cooperation agreement (SCCA) with a consortium of Chinese enterprises
involving a US$3.2 billion mining project and US$6 billion for a set of public infrastructure projects to be
implemented in two phases. All projects are to be executed by Sicomines, a new mining company jointly
owned by the Congolese state-owned mining conglomerate Gecamines (32 percent) and Chinese partners
China Railway Engineering Corporation and Sinohydro. The agreement was amended in October 2009 to
exclude the second phase public infrastructure projects, leaving just a single phase totaling US$3 billion to
be implemented over the period 2009–14. The amended agreement also limited the government guarantee
to the financing of the infrastructure projects. By end-2014, only US$ 478 million in infrastructure loans and
US$ 1.3 billion in mining loans had been disbursed.
The current debt sustainability analysis (DSA) is conducted based on the terms laid out in the October 2009
amendment. Infrastructure projects are divided into two categories: priority projects and non-priority
projects. Infrastructure and mining projects are financed from loans made by Chinese banks and by
Sicomines’ Chinese shareholders. Fifteen percent of the earnings from the mining operation are used to pay
dividends with the remainder allocated to amortization of the loans (including capitalized interest).20
The amendment specifies a seniority rule according to which the priority infrastructure loans are repaid first,
the mining loans second, and the non-priority infrastructure loans last.
The government has guaranteed the US$ 3 billion in public infrastructure loans. However, the guarantee on
any such infrastructure debt outstanding can be called only after 2034. If it is not called, there is no
repayment burden on the budget. Sicomines is expected to begin production in 2015 and to start servicing
its debt in 2016. Based on current information, the earnings from the mining project are forecast to
completely pay off the infrastructure loans by 2026. However, the repayment schedule is contingent on
Sicomines’ earnings and on the debt disbursement profile. Under the assumed disbursement profile,
repayments will extend beyond 2034 if Sicomines’ earnings drop by more than 22 percent each year.
Following the practice of previous years, this DSA includes all debt service payments related to SCCA
infrastructure loans in the present value of PPGE debt.

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
4.
One of the main changes since the 2014 DSA is the sharp drop in international
commodity prices. Due to the DRC’s heavy reliance on extractive industries, its exports and fiscal
revenues are highly exposed to movements in the prices of minerals, in particular copper. The fall
in copper prices in 2014 and the lower outlook for commodity prices in the medium term directly
affect the projected trajectory of the debt-to-exports ratio. In the short term, however, the price
shock is offset by an upward revision of projected export volumes as Sicomines starts its
operations earlier than expected (see Text Table II.2).
20

Sicomines is exempt from any taxes and customs duties until its debt has been repaid.

5.
As in the 2014 DSA, strong growth over the medium term is supported by large
investments in mining and public infrastructure projects. The recent decline in commodity
prices has not had a significant effect on mining investment and output so far, as prices are still
far above the break-even point. As a result, foreign direct investment (FDI) will likely continue to
be the most important source of external financing. The strong growth in mining production
should also lead to improved fiscal revenues starting in 2015, as the tax holiday for several large
mining projects expired at end-2014.

Box 2. Macroeconomic Assumptions for 2015–35
For the medium term (2015–20), projections are consistent with the macroeconomic
framework of the 2015 Article IV Consultation.
Long-term (2021–35) projections assume macroeconomic stability, moderate growth, and a
more rapid development of the domestic economy, as bottlenecks to private sector activity
become less stringent.21 As a consequence, the share of mining activities in GDP is projected to
become less important, so that exports, FDI, and mining revenue outflows gradually decline as a
share of GDP.
Real GDP growth is expected to remain strong at 9.2 percent in 2015, gradually declining to
5.4 percent in 2020 and reaching an average rate of 3.8 percent for the period 2021–35.
Average Inflation (measured by the GDP deflator in dollars) is 0.7 percent in 2014 and is
expected to remain at around 1 percent in the medium-long run.
The primary fiscal balance displayed a surplus of 0.4 percent of GDP in 2014 and is expected to
remain positive in the medium term. The long-run average primary surplus is 0.3 percent.
The non-interest current account deficit is projected to remain high in the medium term, at an
average of about 9 percent of GDP, reflecting the equipment imports and dividend outflows of
the mining sector. In the long term it should narrow to 3.3 percent of GDP by 2035, reflecting the
declining share of the mineral sector in the economy.
Financing: Although FDI is expected to decrease in percent of GDP from 5.4 percent in the
medium term to 4.7 percent on average in the long run, it should remain the main financing
source of the current account deficit. Aid flows represented 4.6 percent of GDP in 2014. For the
long term, this ratio would decline to an average of around 2 percent.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY RESULTS
6.
Because repayments of the loans start earlier than expected due to Sicomines
starting operations in 2015 instead of 2016, the present value of debt was revised upward
for the short to medium term. The delays in disbursements of the infrastructure loans under
the SCCA did not lead to a reduction in the PV of debt, as the contracted debt amounts remain
unchanged. To the contrary, the earnings of the mining operation will be used to repay the
priority infrastructure loans from 2016 on, two years ahead of the estimate underlying the 2014

21

By 2014, the relative contribution of the services sector to real GDP growth was already substantial, and it
is expected to further increase in the long term.

DSA. Given the concessionality of the infrastructure loans, an earlier repayment raises the present
value of debt in the short term, with a steeper decline thereafter.
7.
The most extreme shock22 leads to a breach of the debt-to-exports ratio, while all
other external debt indicators remain below their respective thresholds in all scenarios.
With the shock to exports, the PV of debt-to-export ratio would increase significantly from
55 percent in 2015 to 111 percent in 2017 and remain well above the threshold of 100 percent
through 2024. Under a one-time depreciation shock, the debt service-to-revenue ratio
experiences a near breach of the corresponding threshold. (see Figures 1 and 3, Tables 1 and 2).
8.
Overall, compared with the 2014 DSA, the current results suggest that the DRC’s
risk of debt distress remains moderate. In the baseline scenario all indicators remain far below
their respective critical thresholds. This result reflects the authorities’ prudent fiscal stance and
comes despite a downward revision of commodity prices since the 2014 DSA. On the other hand,
the analysis reveals that a further drop in export prices may put debt ratios above their respective
thresholds. The overall risk assessment is validated by the probabilistic approach.23 A caveat
applies, as the DSA methodology cannot fully capture the modalities of the SCCA with its
variable repayment. The prospect of early amortization raises the debt indicators in the short and
medium term, even though it significantly reduces the government’s exposure. However, this risk
reducing factor is outweighed by the fact that the Public Debt Management Agency (DGDP) does
not monitor disbursements under the SCCA. Moreover, a further shock to copper prices would
inevitably slow down the amortization, thereby raising the government’s exposure.

PUBLIC DSA RESULTS
9.
The DRC’s (estimated) domestic debt primarily consists of domestic arrears, most
of which were incurred prior to 2007. These include arrears owed to domestic creditors, “social
debts” (e.g., wages owed to past government employees), arrears owed to state-owned
enterprises (SOEs), arrears owed to suppliers and contractors, and unpaid monetary awards
stemming from judicial decisions. No new arrears were reported since the 2014 DSA. However,
the DGDP’s estimate for arrears is based on an audit conducted with the assistance of two audit
firms, but with a two-year lag in reporting. Not all the arrears identified in the initial audit have
been certified and many claims on the government may be at least partly offset by liabilities
owed to the government. Information on interest rates is missing. Based on the audit, the
potential domestic government debt outstanding at the end of 2014 remained at US$1.4 billion
(3.9 percent of GDP). The baseline includes the expected clearance of all arrears by 2028.

22

When looking at the debt-to-export ratio, the most extreme shock is calibrated as an export shock in 2016–17
equal to the historical average of export growth minus one standard deviation.

23

The analysis of debt indicators alone places the DRC at the borderline between low and moderate risk, so that
the complementary analysis of distress probabilities (Figure 3) is required.

10.
Public debt remains sustainable even under the most extreme shock scenario. The
most extreme shock is a one-time real depreciation by 30 percent in 2016. This implies a rise of
the PV of the debt to GDP ratio from 18.5 percent to a maximum of 25 percent in 2016, below
the benchmark for public debt ratios of 38 percent. The shock has also a significant impact on
the PV of the debt-to-revenue ratio, which rises from 123 percent of GDP in 2015 to 150 percent
in 2016 and a gradual decline thereafter. All other scenarios closely follow the baseline in its
gradual decline of debt ratios (see Figure 2).

AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS
11.
The authorities concurred with the overall assessment of DRC’s debt sustainability.
They reiterated their commitment to a cautious fiscal policy stance and to seeking a high degree
of concessionality for new borrowing.

CONCLUSION
12.
The DRC’s debt sustainability rating remains at “moderate” risk of debt distress.
This is mainly on account of sound macroeconomic fundamentals. A significant portion of the
public debt stock and repayment profile in the DRC is attributable to the publicly-guaranteed
infrastructure loans under the Sicomines agreement. Regular updates on projected
disbursements and debt service are thus crucial to provide a valid assessment of the DRC’s debt
sustainability. Under the current framework, the country is still vulnerable to shocks to
commodity prices that would reduce growth and drive the PV of debt-to-export ratio above its
threshold. Moreover, a sufficiently large price shock could undermine the economics of the
Sicomines mining project, in particular its ability to generate the earnings necessary to pay off
the infrastructure loans, thus transferring the repayment burden for much or all of those loans to
the central government. It is urgent that the DRC continues to improve its compilation of debt
data, including Sicomines data, and strengthen its debt management capacity. Meanwhile, given
the uncertainties, the DRC should continue its cautious approach to external borrowing.

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly a
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the
completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the
decision point. Hence these two numbers cannot be added.

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed during the interim period.
29
The MDRI provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible countries that qualified for the assistance. Grant assistance
from MDRI Trust and HIPC resources provide debt relief to cover the full stock of debt owed to the Fund as of end2004 that remains outstanding at the time the member qualifies for such debt relief.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
The currency of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is the Congo franc (CDF). The
de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating, although the Fund classifies the de facto
exchange rate arrangement as “stabilized.” At end-July 2015, the rate was US$1=CF 924.89.
Effective February 10, 2003, the DRC accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2
(a) 3, and 4, of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement; however, the DRC maintains measures that
give rise to one exchange rate restriction and one multiple currency practice subject to
Fund approval. The exchange restriction involves an outstanding net debt position against
other contracting members under the inoperative regional payments agreement with the
Economic Community of the Great Lakes Countries. The multiple currency practice relates
to a fixed exchange rate provided for in a bilateral payments agreement with Zimbabwe.
Last Article IV Consultation:
Consultations with the DRC are held in accordance with the provisions of the 2010
Decision on consultation cycles approved in September 2010. The last Article IV
consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on June 9, 2014.
Safeguards Assessment:
An updated safeguards assessment of the Banque centrale du Congo (BCC)
completed in April 2010 found that while most of the 2008 recommendations had
been implemented, significant risks remained. The BCC continued to lack
autonomy from the government and was in need of recapitalization, and the
absence of an independently defined financial reporting framework continued to
impair transparency. The Ministry of Finance completed the first phase of the
recapitalization in March 2011 by bringing the BCC's net worth to zero. The IMF is
providing technical assistance to support the recapitalization efforts. The transition
process to a new financial reporting framework has been significantly delayed; the
BCC now aims to issue their 2015 financial statements in accordance with IFRS.
Technical Assistance:
STA
The focus of the assistance is placed on developing national accounts, including data,
compilation, and methodology. STA has provided support to finalize national accounts
consistent with the System of National Accounts 93 for several years up to 2013.

Simplification of the tax system—notably tax incentives and the myriad of fees and charges
that hinder the business climate—remains a key priority, along with better mobilization of
mining sector revenue through a new Mining Code and tighter customs control. Although
authorities have started to streamline fees and charges, much remains to be done and
progress is slow given administrative obstacles. Customs and VAT measures are largely
administrative in nature and depend on the political capacity of authorities to bring all
potential taxpayers in the tax net. Other priorities include: (i) reinforcing the administration of
revenue collected from extractive industries (EI) and VAT administration, and improving
customs operations and (ii) consolidating the state budget, the medium-term budget framework
(MTBF) and the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF).

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision to the Fund is broadly adequate (category B as per SM/13/155) for
surveillance and program monitoring purposes, but upgrades to the national accounts, balance of
payments, and government finance statistics would be helpful. In spite of difficulties, the authorities
have continued to produce an array of economic and financial statistics, most of which are published
in the annual report of the Central Bank of the Congo (BCC) or its monthly statistical bulletin.
National accounts: Annual national accounts (ANA) are compiled in constant and current prices by
National Institute of Statistics (INS) under the Ministry of Plan with the technical assistance (TA) from
IMF/AFC. The compilation methodology has then changed since 2006 with the use of ERETES
software and the compilation of definitive ANA for 2005 and 2006 in compliance with the System of
National Accounts 1993 (1993 SNA) (implying an upward revision of GDP by about 60 percent). The
insufficient human resources pushes the authorities of INS to temporary suspend the use of the
ERETES software. The INS compiles then ANA for 2007 to 2009 on a light system with Microsoft
Excel. The use of ERETES software is resumed in 2013 for the compilation of 2010 definitive ANA
which are ongoing. Once the 2010 definitive ANA are achieved a provisional ANA system is
supposed to be based on that 2010 ANA to compile 2011, 2012, 2013 etc. accounts.
Price statistics: Consumer price indices (CPI) are calculated for Kinshasa by the INS, the BCC, the
Institute of Economic and Social Research (IESR), and the Economics Section of the U.S. Embassy in
Kinshasa. In 2011, the INS started to compile CPI data Country wide using weights calculated on the
basis of the 2005 household survey. Prices are collected in the 11 provinces (the BCC in 2013 began
the compilation of a similar CPI using a slightly different basket and different weights and based on
prices in 5 provinces).
Government finance statistics: The BCC produces aggregated monthly statistics on a cash basis
based on its own accounting for the government cash operations. The treasury produces two sets of
monthly statistics based on its own records: one relates to the transactions executed through the
BCC, the other set attempts to consolidate operations through commercial bank accounts and offbudget operations. These statistics do not rely on an integrated double-entry public accounting
system and do not provide sufficient details about the nature of expenditures owing to problems in
the expenditure chain. However, the treasury has started to produce quarterly expenditure data
reports by ministry and institution.
The current work on tax administration and expenditure control is expected to improve the quality
and timeliness of fiscal statistics. In parallel with technical assistance on public expenditure
management, a STA multisector statistics advisor has been advising on government finance statistics,
producing improvements in the quality of the statistics. Furthermore, adoption of a simplified
double-entry bookkeeping system should significantly improve the availability of data on
government financial operations.
In 2003 the DRC reported annual data up to 2002 for the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook in the format of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 but has not reported

subsequently. However, work is underway to resume submission of data to the GFSY, beginning with
data for 2010.
Monetary statistics: Monetary and financial statistics (MFS) are compiled and reported to the Fund
by the BCC Directorate of Statistics. These statistics are now generally reliable but institutional
coverage, source data, and timeliness issues remain to be addressed.
The BCC has improved data compilation with the adoption in 2007 and 2011 of new charts of
accounts for the central bank and commercial banks, respectively. The sectorization of institutional
units and the classification of financial assets used in these new charts of accounts are broadly in line
with the Fund’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual’s methodology. In September 2013, the
BCC completed migration to the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs) for the submission of its MFS to
the Fund. Since then, SRF-based monetary statistics have been reported to STA for publication in IFS.
Despite this progress, MFS data are still in need of improvements in terms of financial institution
coverage, source data reliability, and the timeliness for reporting the data to the Fund. The
depository corporation survey does not include data from non-bank deposit taking institutions, a
growing sector in the country. In addition, source data from commercial banks are not fully reliable
as respondents do not completely master the new sectoral chart of accounts yet. Similarly, the data
is reported with delays of up to five months in a package that include several months. Only when
STA send reminders, does the BCC submit the data.
Balance of payments: Annual balance of payments statistics are compiled with information on the
exports and imports of large public and semipublic enterprises, BCC payment records, and a survey
of the foreign operations of residents. The estimates also take account of information on the
informal sector and foreign aid flows provided by the World Bank and the local UN Development
Program office, which collects the data from the European Union, embassies, and nongovernmental
organizations. In effect balance of payments statistics are compiled using data from different
sources, supplemented by estimates. In February 2012, the authorities created an interministerial
committee, lead by the central bank and also including representatives from customs, and the
National Statistics Institute and key sectors, to improve the collection and the validation of balance
of payment data and ensure its regular publication.

Statement by Mr. Yambaye, Executive Director for Democratic Republic of the
Congo and Mr. Allé, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
September 2, 2015

The DRC authorities appreciate the candid dialogue with Staff and thank the Board and
Management for the continuous support to their development agenda. The recent discussions
held in Kinshasa in the context of the 2015 Article IV consultation gave another opportunity
to take stock of the country’s progress in ensuring macroeconomic stability and implementing
structural reforms and to assess the challenges facing the economy. The staff
report put forward is a fair analysis of the economic and financial situation and broadly
reflects the authorities’ views. The Selected Issues Paper is also welcome as a useful element
in the authorities’ overall thinking on the DRC’s development dynamics.
In the recent past, the DRC has been posting a strong macroeconomic performance on the
back of buoyant mineral exports and continuously improving overall economic management.
The 2014 growth rate ranks among the highest in the world and inflation has drastically
abated. Significant progress has also been recorded in the governance of the natural resource
sector with the authorities committed to keep pace with this positive momentum. Likewise,
the authorities are cognizant that they need to step up reforms in many areas with the view to
entrench growth and reduce poverty in a sustainable fashion. In this regard, the authorities’
efforts over the medium term will focus on easing the business and socio-political
environment for private sector development, improving fiscal management to build buffers
against commodity price shocks, stepping up de-dollarization to enhance monetary policy
and foster financial deepening, diversifying the economy to further structural transformation
for job creation.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK

2014 has confirmed the trend of strong growth displayed by DRC over the past years. Real
GDP growth is estimated to have recorded a solid 9.2 percent owing to high copper
production and performing telecommunications, trade and transport sectors. Inflation is
subdued at 1 percent, falling sharply from double digits territories in three years. The
government budget is in balance with a low debt ratio.
The medium term outlook remains positive, with growth projected to remain strong, at 9.2
percent in 2015 and around 8.4 percent in 2016-17, essentially driven by the mineral and
service sectors. It is the firm intention of the authorities to pursue steadfastly policies that

2
will maintain high, sustainable and inclusive growth while also ensuring macroeconomic
stability. However, the authorities are cognizant of the risks highlighted by staff. While they
will continue their efforts to address them, they are also of the view that some of these risks
are manageable. In this vein, they see scope for their ongoing actions to maintain a benign
political situation, which should help to boost investor confidence. Likewise, the efforts
initiated with the electoral commission – CENI - to cut elections costs should help keep
spending pressures in check and not jeopardize further the fiscal stance.
MACROECONOMIC POLICIES GOING FORWARD

Fiscal policy
Cognizant of the challenges still facing the economy, the DRC authorities are committed to
implementing policies to further improve the outlook. In this regard, enhancing fiscal policy
remains a key objective, with a particular emphasis on domestic revenue mobilization.
Efforts will consist of bringing the VAT back to its performance path. To this end, the
authorities concur with the staff’s recommendations and will enhance the VAT
administration through measures to modernize and simplify procedures. An important line of
actions of the authorities will consist of increasing significantly the contribution of the
natural resource sector to fiscal revenue. They have already implemented the conclusions of
the National Conference on Mineral Resources Management, which should help boost the
revenue share of the sector. Enacting a new mining code aligned with international best
practice is another option under discussion. The revenue-enhancing measures identified by
Fund TA will also be part of the overall action plan.
On the spending side, the authorities are committed to keep outlays under control. To this end,
a decree on Fiscal Governance in the DRC is being finalized and will be adopted soon as
a major anchor for fiscal policy. This is expected to strengthen the medium-term expenditure
framework. The authorities also share staff‘s recommendations for enhancing budget
credibility, including the need to improve resource forecasts. The overall effort to build
capacity, especially on national account statistics will help address this issue going forward.
Along with the favorable macroeconomic fundamentals, the authorities welcome staff
assessment indicating that DRC’s risk of debt distress remains “moderate”. Our authorities
are committed to maintain a prudent borrowing strategy and to enhance debt management
capacity to preserve long-term debt sustainability.
Monetary policy and financial sector development
Enhancing the effectiveness of monetary policy is an important endeavor for our authorities.
Among others, the development of the financial sector should help to this end, besides its key
role of supporting the private sector activity. Discussion with staff and past initiatives such as
the 2014 FSAP provided useful materials and policy directions, which the authorities intend to
follow through with concrete actions. In this regard, they will take steps to strengthen the
central bank –BCC. Measures include the BCC’s recapitalization, cutting its operating costs
by focusing on core activities and improving its governance and enhancing staff’s capacity.

3
The passage of the Central Bank Law is set to help on many of these fronts and strengthen
the BCC’s credibility.
The authorities are also committed to enhance the financial sector by implementing structural
reforms aimed at improving financial intermediation and financial inclusion. New financing
instruments are being devised such as a foreign exchange swap facility arranged with the
International Finance Corporation. Going forward, other reforms meant to strengthen the
financial sector are underway, including measures to enhance consumer protection and mobile
banking, as well as to further de-dollarization and reinforce banking supervision.
NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

Natural resource endowment is a major asset to the DRC’s economy. The authorities are
mindful that its sound management is critical to growth, to government revenue and to the
country’s overall development. Significant progress has been made recently to improve
transparency in the sector by implementing the recommendations of the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (EITI). The authorities share staff’s views on the need to take
additional measures “to strengthen the government’s oversight of the SOEs and ensure that
they comply with the obligations to publish contracts of all mining operations and resort to
competitive biddings when natural resource assets are sold.” Moreover, the authorities place a
particular importance on the new mining code under discussion, and set to replace the current
2002 code. Key features of the new code should further enhance transparency and
accountability in the mining sector and help address critical issues such as its fair
contribution to domestic revenue. Main proposed changes include: (i) increase in the royalty
rate; (ii) alignment of the corporate income tax (30 percent) to the general regime (35
percent); (iii) introduction of super profit tax; and (iv) provisions to secure corporate tax
basis.
STRUCTURAL REFORMS FOR ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND JOB CREATION

The DRC authorities are fully aware that enhancing the inclusiveness of growth, creating jobs
and addressing poverty on a more sustainable footing require the implementation of bold
structural reforms to bolster economic diversification and structural transformation. Staff‘s
selected issues chapter on “The Quest Towards Diversification” shed light on the structural
shift from agriculture to industry and services being witnessed in DRC. The authorities are of
the view that such shift should be accompanied with measures to enhance productivity in the
agriculture sector to maintain and strengthen output, while enlarging the industrial and export
bases. In this regard, reforms underway in the natural resource sector should improve the
business environment in this specific area and attract new investors.
Furthermore, improving the overall business climate is a top priority to the authorities. They
concur with staff that pressing measures should include: (i) simplifying the tax system to
support higher non-mineral activity and promote inclusive growth, (ii) streamlining the
regulation for granting construction permits and transferring ownership, and (iii) facilitating
access to credit while enforcing contracts. The authorities are also mindful that they should
sustain their ongoing efforts to address key bottlenecks such as the electricity shortages and

4
the infrastructure gap. Furthermore, they see scope for their financial sector reforms to
support the dynamism in the service sector and avail credit to help reduce informality in
commerce activities.
The improvement of the general security situation of the country and the political
environment is also a key element to enhance confidence of private investors. In this regard,
the authorities are determined to address all factors of fragility and implement the agreed
institutional reforms aimed at entrenching democracy.
CONCLUSION

The DRC has made important strides over the past years in terms of macroeconomic
performance and poverty reduction. Growth has been strong in a stable environment and the
outlook is promising owing to positive prospects on mining activity. Yet, unemployment and
poverty still remain acute despite some progress. The DRC authorities are striving to conduct
the needed reforms to entrench growth and bolster economic diversification. In the period
ahead, they are committed to step up macroeconomic policies to enhance buffers and ringfence against shocks as they take steps to transform the economic landscape. In this effort,
harnessing natural resource endowment for the country’s overall development is of particular
importance. Our DRC authorities appreciate the Board’s continuous support in their
challenging endeavors.
