most of the meetings.

•

At the conclusion of the last Article IV consultation on April 28, 2003, Executive
Directors commended the Moroccan authorities for maintaining macroeconomic
stability, despite adverse weather conditions and a difficult international
environment. Directors agreed that Morocco’s growth performance remains
insufficient to generate a significant decline in unemployment and poverty, and that
its fiscal policy needed to be further strengthened. They underscored the
importance of sustained structural reforms, in particular public sector and judiciary
reforms, strengthening governance, improving the business environment, and labor
market, trade, and financial sector reforms. Directors were generally of the view
that in the context of Morocco’s increasing trade and financial integration, a more
flexible exchange rate regime would improve Morocco’s resilience to external
shocks and growth prospects.

•

The authorities have enhanced the transparency of their policies. They have
published the staff reports since 2001 and consented in principle to the Fund’s
publication of the 2004 Article IV staff report.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Over the recent years, Morocco has achieved stable macroeconomic conditions with low
inflation and a strong external position. However, growth has been insufficient to reduce
poverty and unemployment. Poverty remains pervasive particularly in rural areas.

•

Macroeconomic conditions remained strong in 2003, with inflation at below 2 percent, an
external current account surplus of 3 percent of GDP, external reserves covering the
outstanding public foreign debt at end 2003, and public debt-to-GDP ratio continuing to
decline. Real growth accelerated in 2003 mainly because of an exceptionally good cereal
harvest, but it is likely to drop from 5.5 percent to 3 percent in 2004 because of a decline
in agricultural output.

•

The overriding issue is to achieve strong and durable growth in a context of increasing
integration of Morocco into the world economy. The authorities’ strategy rests on two
pillars: (a) a gradual adjustment of the fiscal position; and (b) continued structural
reforms to favor both a rise in private investment and in economy-wide productivity.

•

The current fiscal position cannot be sustained over the medium term in both the
authorities’ and staff’s views. After widening by about one percentage point of GDP in
2003, the fiscal deficit is projected to remain close to 5.5 percent of GDP in 2004. Large
fiscal deficits have been easily financed thanks to substantial proceeds from privatization
and the abundant domestic liquidity conditions, which have prevented upward pressure
on interest rates. If actions are not taken to reduce the fiscal deficit, the debt-to-GDP ratio
could reach unsustainable levels over the medium term. The authorities’ medium-term
fiscal adjustment strategy would gradually bring the deficit down to 3 percent of GDP by
2009. The staff recommends a front-loaded fiscal consolidation effort to provide room to
absorb shocks along the way and help assuage fears of future tax and interest rate
increases that would hurt private investment.

•

The authorities and the staff share the view that broad-based structural reforms will be
needed to deliver a sustained improvement in economic performance. The authorities
have already accelerated their efforts to tackle long-standing structural issues. Priority
areas are trade liberalization, improvements in the business environment, and reform of
the pension system and the financial sector.

•

Although there is no evidence suggesting a misalignment of the dirham, the staff
considers that an eventual move to a flexible exchange rate regime would improve
Morocco’s resilience to shocks and better support the authorities’ growth objectives.
Such a move would require the establishment of a monetary policy framework that would
provide an alternative nominal anchor, a durable reduction in the fiscal deficit, and a
continued strengthening of the financial system. The authorities have been considering
the issue of the appropriate exchange rate regime to sustain their growth objectives. They
are not yet fully convinced about the merits of a flexible regime, but remain open to the
idea. They have requested staff to prepare a study on this issue.

I. KEY ISSUES AND BACKGROUND
1.
Over recent years, Morocco has achieved stable macroeconomic and financial
conditions. Inflation has remained low; the external current account balance has shifted from
small deficits to sizeable surpluses following a surge in workers’ remittances and weak
domestic demand; and external official reserves have increased and reached a comfortable
level (Table 1). However, two major challenges remain:
•

Accelerating growth and reducing its dependency on good weather. Higher and
less volatile growth is necessary to reduce unemployment and poverty, which remains
pervasive particularly in rural areas (Charts 1, 2, and 3, and Table 2). To this end,
broad-based market-oriented structural reforms are required.

Making progress toward fiscal consolidation. Fiscal deficits are large and the public debtto-GDP ratio, although declining, remains high (Chart 4).1 Strong durable growth will require
fiscal reforms to place public finances on a sustainable path to foster a reorientation of
domestic resources toward private activity, while dispelling the risk of future tax increases
and higher interest rates.

2.
Fund surveillance in recent years underscored the importance of tackling the
growth and fiscal challenges forcefully to improve Morocco’s overall economic
performance and reduce unemployment and poverty. In particular, the staff’s advice focused
on the need to: (a) accelerate structural reforms; (b) address the real exchange rate
appreciation which took place in the early 1990s and which constrained growth; and (c) bring
fiscal policy back on a sustainable position through a comprehensive reform of the civil
service and the tax system.
3.
The authorities’ structural reform efforts accelerated substantially starting from
2002, after the political opening and democratic transition were completed with the country
holding its second general elections, and with the appointment of a new government. Major
headways were: (a) the approval of a new labor code, after discussions that spanned over

5.5 percent during 2000–03.

more than 20 years; (b) the strengthening of the financial system in line with the
recommendations of the FSAP; (c) the continued trade liberalization; and (d) the successful
privatization of public enterprises, coupled with efforts to improve the financial performance
of the remaining public enterprises. Moreover, efforts have been made to fight poverty and
improve social conditions. These efforts include the development of rural infrastructure to
favor rural development, construction of affordable housing for the low income population,
and passage of the family code that enhances the rights of females
4.
The appreciation of the dirham in real effective terms has been reversed since
2001. The nominal devaluation of the dirham in April 2001 partly corrected the real
appreciation experienced since the early 1990s (Chart 5). Since the devaluation, the dirham
continued to depreciate in real effective terms reflecting partly the low inflation in Morocco
relative to its trading partners and partly a further depreciation of the dirham in nominal
effective terms.

5.
In line with staff policy advice, the authorities started to move toward fiscal
consolidation in 2002 by reducing the fiscal deficit by more than one percentage point of
GDP to 4.7 percent of GDP. This reduction mainly reflected savings on the wage bill and
lower investment spending from Fonds Hassan II.2 However, due to various reasons

50 percent of privatization proceeds may be used to finance Fonds Hassan II. For further discussion, see section
on Fiscal Policy.

-9-

discussed below, the fiscal deficit widened to 5.5 percent of GDP in 2003, reversing the
deficit reduction of the previous year. Thus, fiscal consolidation remains a key issue to be
attended.
6.
Macroeconomic conditions remained strong in 2003. Inflation of below 2 percent,
an external current account surplus of 3 percent of GDP, and external reserves at 10 months
of imports and covering the outstanding public foreign debt have placed Morocco in a solid
short-term macroeconomic position (Table 3). These developments improved market views
on the Moroccan economy as evidenced by the successful issuance of a €400 million
Eurobond in July 2003 (with a spread of 215 basis points over European benchmarks), the
narrowing of secondary market spreads on Morocco’s sovereign debt, and the recent revision
by a credit agency of its foreign currency outlook on Morocco from stable to positive.3
II. REPORT ON POLICY DISCUSSIONS
7.
In view of the recent developments and the prospects of a favorable macroeconomic
outlook for 2004, policy discussions focused on defining a broad-based strategy to improve
growth performance over the medium period. Discussions were held in the context of a
medium-term scenario that was developed jointly by the authorities and the staff (Table 4).
8.
The overriding issue for Morocco is to achieve strong and durable growth. The
authorities and the staff agreed that to make a dent in poverty and unemployment, Morocco
needs to grow at rates well above 5 percent for a sustained period of time. The Moroccan
economy grew at a healthy 5.5 percent in 2003 mainly because of exceptionally good cereal
production. Despite the increase in non-agricultural growth to 3.8 percent, overall real GDP
growth would drop to 3 percent in 2004, because of a decline in agricultural output. Thus, to
sustain the desired overall growth over the medium term, nonagricultural growth would need
to accelerate from its current trend of around 3 percent to close to 6 percent. Such a
performance in nonagricultural sectors would also help reduce the volatility in Morocco’s
growth performance over the medium term. To this end, investment and total factor
productivity (TFP) need to rise significantly. Recent developments are encouraging. A
recovery in private economic activity appears underway, driven by investment in
construction and a favorable export performance in nontraditional manufacturing sectors.
9.
The higher growth objective will be pursued in the context of increasing
integration of Morocco into the world economy. The authorities recognize the benefits of
increased integration by continued trade liberalization and a gradual capital account opening.
They also recognize that with increased integration, the Moroccan economy will be
increasingly exposed to external shocks. This new environment will pose new challenges for
macroeconomic policy.

3

Morocco’s rating remains below investment grade.

- 10 -

10.
The authorities’ strategy to achieve their growth objectives rests on two pillars.
These are: (a) a gradual adjustment of the fiscal position, which not only would translate into
improved private sector confidence, but also would generate higher domestic savings to
finance the increased investment needs, while maintaining a sound overall external position;
and (b) continued structural reforms to favor both a rise in private investment and higher
TFP. In the staff’s view, these policies would eventually need to be complemented by
changes in the monetary and exchange rate policy framework.
11.
Morocco’s external position is likely to remain strong in 2004, with external
reserves projected at the equivalent of about 10 months of imports and the external current
account surplus at 2.3 percent of GDP. Inflation is projected to remain subdued at 2 percent.
A. Fiscal Policy
12.
The 2003 fiscal deficit is estimated to have widened to 5.5 percent of GDP
(Table 5). This deterioration resulted from salary increases and promotions for education
personnel, increased security-related spending after the Casablanca bombings in May 2003,
and weaker revenue performance on account of ongoing trade liberalization and tariff
reductions on selected imports. However, because of high privatization revenues and interest
rates on government debt lower than GDP growth, the debt-to-GDP ratio declined to
68.2 percent in 2003 from 71.5 percent in 2002.4
13.
The authorities are of the view that the staff’s measure of the fiscal deficit
overstates the fiscal imbalance by including spending from the special investment fund,
Fonds Hassan II, (0.4 percent of GDP in 2003) in overall expenditures. Spending from
Fonds Hassan II is financed by drawing down the fund’s deposits at the central bank. Thus,
deficit increases generated by Fonds Hassan II spending affect the government’s net debt
position but not its gross position. In the staff’s view, there are two main reasons to continue
to consolidate the fund with the operations of the central government. Investment spending
from the Fonds Hassan II has a direct impact on domestic demand Furthermore, there is
evidence that Fonds Hassan II spending has in part replaced central government investment
spending, notwithstanding the change in its legal status.5 The authorities and the staff agree
that the forthcoming fiscal ROSC exercise could provide a significant input on this issue, in
the context of its recommendations to improve transparency in fiscal policy.

4

Significant financing from the deposits held by public enterprises and the post office with the treasury also
contributed to lower the government debt-to-GDP ratio (see Box 1 in Country Report No. 03/141, (5/28/03)).

5

In an attempt to speed up the fund’s disbursements, Parliament gave the Fonds Hassan II a legal status similar
to that of a public enterprise in 2002. Prior to 2002 the Fund’s operation were included in the central
government.

- 11 -

14.
The 2004 fiscal deficit is projected at 5.4 percent of GDP, broadly unchanged
from 2003.6 With such a deficit and the envisaged privatization receipts, the public debt-toGDP ratio would decline from 68.2 percent of GDP to 67.6 percent of GDP. 7 Although the
fiscal outlook for 2004 does not reverse the deterioration experienced in 2003, the authorities
noted that excluding the expenditures from Fonds Hassan II, the deficit would decline to
4.6 percent in 2004, from 5.1 percent of GDP in 2003. They also noted that a number of
measures with short-term budgetary costs will improve the government’s ability to curb
spending over the medium period. These measures, which cost about 1 percent of GDP,
include: (a) the introduction of an early retirement program; (b) the impact of a long wave of
wage negotiations, which came to a conclusion in April 2003 and should not reopen in the
near future; and (c) the cost of the increase in the public sector pension fund contribution
rates.
15.
The staff noted the risks in the fiscal outlook. The budgeted savings resulting from
the reform of the food subsidy system may not be achieved, as the authorities have not yet
decided on how to reform the system.8 The expected privatization proceeds (2.7 percent of
GDP) may also not materialize and complicate deficit financing, possibly raising the
government debt-to-GDP ratio.9 In this context, the staff underscored the importance of
timely implementation of budgeted measures, stepped up tax collections, and strict controls
on spending to keep the deficit in 2004 below that of 2003 and enhance the credibility of the
authorities’ medium-term consolidation objectives. In addition, the potential budgetary
implications of last the February’s earthquake are not yet known.
16.
The current fiscal position cannot be sustained over the medium period, in both
the authorities’ and staff’s views. During 2001–03, large fiscal deficits have been financed
partly by substantial proceeds from privatizations. In addition, the abundant domestic
liquidity has prevented the high government domestic financing needs from translating into
upward pressures on interest rates. However, privatization proceeds cannot last indefinitely
and liquidity conditions are bound to change when the ongoing recovery takes momentum
and investment demand picks up. Under a no policy change scenario, the fiscal deficit would
6

The fiscal deficit projection for 2004 is lower than that targeted by the 2004 budget law (6.8 percent of GDP).
The difference reflects: (a) an upward revision in the expected revenue collection, which the budget projected
conservatively; and (b) lower-than-originally projected spending from Fonds Hassan II.

7

Net of Fonds Hassan II’s deposits with BAM, the public debt-to-GDP ratio would decline to 64.2 percent of
GDP, from 65.3 percent of GDP.
8

Consumer price subsidies are provided for flour and sugar through a combination of tariff protections and
budgetary contributions (which amounted to 1.1 percent of GDP in 2003).

9

The authorities expect to sell an additional 16 percent of the government shares in Maroc Telecom, bringing
its private ownership to above 50 percent. The Banque Centrale Populaire and a few small companies are also
expected to be privatized in 2004.

- 12 -

widen to 7 percent of GDP by 2009 and the debt-to-GDP ratio would rise to about 80 percent
of GDP and higher with adverse shocks (Chart 6).

17.
The authorities’ medium-term fiscal strategy would gradually bring the deficit
(including expenditures under Fonds Hassan II) down to about 3 percent of GDP by
2009, implying a decline in the government debt-to-GDP ratio to 64 percent (Chart 7). On
the revenue side, a comprehensive tax reform effort and strengthening tax administration
would ensure that increased VAT collections offset the losses deriving form continued trade
liberalization. The authorities plan to define their tax reform strategy in detail with the help
of an FAD technical assistance mission in May, 2004. On the expenditure side, the ongoing
public sector reform (with the assistance of the World Bank) should lower the wage bill by
about 2 percentage points of GDP by 2009. Increased spending for social safety nets will
offset part of the savings from the envisaged elimination of the food subsidy system.
18.
The staff recommended a front-loaded fiscal consolidation strategy. A significant
deficit reduction early on will be essential to enhance the credibility of the adjustment effort
and to help assuage fears of future tax and interest rate increases that could adversely affect
private investment. Such a strategy would also ensure the achievement of the medium-term
fiscal targets in the event of potential adverse shocks along the way, in light of the limited
ability in the budget to absorb them due to the high shares of wage and interest payments in
the budget. It would also be desirable to aim at a somewhat more ambitious reduction of the
debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium term. The staff’s standard sustainability analysis shows
that this ratio could reach above 100 percent by 2006 under very pessimistic assumptions on

Box 1. Morocco: Pension System
•

The pension system is made of multiple funds, two of which account for the bulk of the
system. The “Caisse Marocaine de Retraite” (CMR) manages two separate government funds,
one for civil servants, and the other for the military. The “Caisse Nationale de Sécurité Sociale”
(CNSS) covers private sector employees.

•

The civil servant fund of the CMR is in surplus but actuarial studies indicate it could be in
deficit by 2010. Its current reserves could cover an additional three years of benefits and
represent 9 percent of GDP. In 2003, the government decided to increase contribution rates
(employer and employee) by 3 percentage points over 2004–06 to bring them to 10 percent and
improve the fund’s financial position. Without this increase, the fund would be in deficit in
2007.

•

The military fund of the CMR has been in deficit despite an increase in the government’s
contribution rate from 7 percent to 14 percent in 2002. The annual deficit of the military
fund represented 0.2 percent of GDP in 2003. The fund does not have reserves and has been
borrowing from the civilian fund to cover its deficit. The outstanding obligations of the military
fund to the civilian fund are estimated at about 1 percent of GDP.

•

The CNSS fund is in surplus but actuarial studies also show that it could be in deficit by
2010. Its current reserves could cover an additional 2.3 years of benefits and represented 4
percent of GDP in 2003.

•

Parametric reforms will be needed to put the pension funds on a sound footing in the
medium term. Authorities are aware of this and have already started work on reform scenarios.
The World Bank is expected to assist in this area.

B. Structural Reforms
19.
The authorities and the staff share the view that broad-based structural reforms
will be needed to deliver a sustained improvement in economic performance. The
authorities indicated their commitment to continue structural reform efforts to promote
private sector activity and enhance productivity of the economy. In addition to fiscal reforms
discussed above, policy discussions focused on the following areas:
•

12

Trade liberalization. Morocco has made progress both at the bilateral and the
multilateral level (Box 2).11 With regard to future trade liberalization efforts, the staff
recommended: (a) reducing the dispersion and average level of tariffs;12 and
(b) broadening trade liberalization at the regional level and ensuring that the other
For further discussion, see “Impact of the Barcelona Process on Morocco’s Trade” (to be issued).

The simple average tariff rate is 26 percent. There are eight multilateral tariff rates, which vary from 0 to
50 percent for nonagricultural products.

- 16 -

bilateral free trade agreements align tariff rates, at a minimum, with those prescribed
in the Association Agreement with the European Union (AAEU) to avoid the
proliferation of tariff schedules that raise the complexity of the trade regime.
Regional trade integration (including among Maghreb countries) would also help
attract foreign direct investment.

Box 2. Morocco: Trade Liberalization Efforts

•

•

A new free trade agreement was concluded with the United States in March 2004. Under
the agreement, which has to be ratified by the U.S. Congress, more than 95 percent of industrial
tariff lines will become duty-free immediately, with the remainder phased out over 9 years. The
agreement includes broad commitments to open services markets. Most of ordinary agricultural
tariffs will be phased out over 15 years and a system of tariff-rate-quotas (TRQs) for politically
sensitive products, such as wheat, will be maintained. The agreement contains a preference
clause that prevents other countries from obtaining better agricultural access to the Moroccan
market than the United States.

•

In accordance with the Association Agreement with the EU, trade on industrial goods that
are not produced in Morocco became duty free in 2003. The Moroccan authorities have
started the reduction of tariff rates on industrial goods that are also produced in Morocco. Trade
on those goods is scheduled to become duty free in 2012. TRQs for agricultural products have
been increased. The authorities have started negotiations with the EU on the liberalization of
trade in the services sector.

•

Morocco, Egypt, Jordan, and Tunisia signed an agreement in February 2004 toward the
creation of a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area by 2010. The accord calls for the lifting of
trade barriers on industrial goods in two years and on agricultural products in five years.

•

In addition the authorities reduced multilateral tariff rates to 10 percent on goods that are
freely traded with the EU. Almost 6,500 tariff lines out of about 17,000 were concerned and
the average tariff rate has dropped by 4 percentage points.

Financial sector reform. The authorities have made good progress in implementing
the recommendations of the FSAP (Box 3). In the discussions, the staff recommended
speedy implementation of the remaining recommendations of the FSAP, including
addressing the fragility of weak specialized public banks (Credit Immobilier et
Hotelier (CIH) and Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole (CNCA)) and nonbank
financial institutions (i.e., pension funds and insurance companies), as well as
strengthening the audit, accounting, and payments systems. The staff also emphasized
that CIH and CNCA should be brought to comply with BAM’s prudential regulations
as soon as possible. In response to the staff enquires on the reasons behind the
significant increase in the nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio in the system (Table 7),
the authorities noted that BAM introduced stricter loan classification rules that

- 17 -

brought up the amount of the reported NPLs.13 They also indicated that the decline in
the capital adequacy ratios in 2003 reflected both increased bank lending and loan
write-offs from two specialized banks (Banque Nationale pour le Développement
Economique (BNDE) and CNCA). The commercial banking system remains sound.
Box 3. Morocco: Progress in Implementing the
Main Recommendations of the FSAP

13

•

Cabinet approval of new central bank and commercial banking laws in 2003. These laws
are expected to provide the legal framework to strengthen the financial sector and clarify the
institutional framework for the conduct of monetary policy. Parliament is expected to approve
these laws in the first half of 2004.

•

Restructuring of the two troubled state-owned banks (Credit Immobilier et Hotelier
(CIH) and Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole (CNCA)). Parliament approved a law
establishing the CNCA as a corporation in December 2003. This law separates its commercial
banking operations from those that are influenced by government’s policies in support of
agriculture. The authorities are considering new restructuring options for the CIH. The date at
which these two banks will be required to comply with BAM’s prudential regulations has been
moved from January 2007 to January 2006.

•

Reviewing the procedures to handle problem banks. The new banking law establishes new
and well-defined procedures that apply to banks experiencing difficulties. The law specifies
when BAM can appoint new management in charge of readdressing the financial position of a
troubled bank and clearly defines its powers vis-à-vis the financial institution’s executive
board.

•

Redefining the role of the remaining state financial institutions to limit the potential for
conflict of interest. The operations of the Caisse de Depot et Gestion (CDG) will be
conducted only on a commercial basis. The internal financial control of the CDG has also been
strengthened.

•

Strengthening banking supervision. The new banking law gives BAM extended powers to
conduct on-site inspections. BAM’s regulations on provisioning requirements and ranking of
risks have been revised. The banking law envisages the establishment of a commission to
coordinate the supervision of different financial sector activities (banking, insurance and
capital markets).

•

A number of laws in line with FSAP recommendations have been approved by
Parliament. These laws concern: (a) the stock market; (b) the investment funds (OPCVM);
(c) public offerings on the stock market; (d) the establishment of a commission to draw up a
code of conduct in the equity and bond markets; (e) the establishment of a central depository;
and (f) the regulation of repo operations.

Prior to 2003, only overdue portions of principal repayments were considered nonperforming. Under the new
regulations, banks classify as nonperforming the overall amount of the outstanding loan on which a scheduled
payment has not taken place.

- 18 -

•

Expanding the role of the private sector. Improvement of the business environment
is essential to promote private sector activity. In this context, the staff underscored the
importance of reform efforts to improve the judicial system, strengthen accountability
in public management, and streamline administrative procedures. The recently
approved labor code, if promptly implemented, could also favor private sector
activity by reducing uncertainties in labor relations and easing lay-off procedures. In
addition, the authorities are implementing their privatization program that, as noted
earlier, includes sales of additional government share in Maroc Telecom in 2004.

•

Public enterprises reform. The authorities have improved the financial control of
public enterprises and formalized relations between the government and these
enterprises in contractual relationships that could help improve their productivity and
the transparency of their management. The authorities and the staff agree that these
efforts should continue with the objective of eventually privatizing the remaining
commercial public enterprises (Box 4).
Box 4. Morocco: Public Enterprises
•

There are 688 public enterprises and entities in Morocco, two-thirds of which operate for
commercial purposes with the remainder being administrative entities. Ten of these enterprises
account for over 85 percent of total turnover.

•

In 2002, their total turnover was DH 98 billion, value added was 12 percent of GDP,
investment amounted to 24 percent of total investment, and employment was 175,000
(4 percent of total employment).

•

Overall profits were slightly negative in 2002, as underfunded pension funds for the railway
company and the tobacco monopoly (now privatized) were written off and transferred to an
external entity. Excluding these transactions, the total net profits of public enterprises were DH
8.6 billion.

•

Public enterprises account for about a third of public and publicly guaranteed external debt.

•

Public enterprises’ investment in 2002 was concentrated in:
¾
¾
¾

¾

•

utilities, major projects include rural electrification and water sanitation;
infrastructure and transport, driven by the expansion of the highway system;
agriculture, particularly for water management projects; and
telecommunication.

Pension reform. The recent increase in the contribution rates (by employer and
employee) will improve the prospects of the public sector pension fund (CMR).
Nevertheless, the pension funds both for the public and private sectors could be in
deficit by 2010 and are actuarially unsound. Thus, the staff and authorities agree that
there is a pressing need to develop (in collaboration with the World Bank) a
comprehensive reform strategy for the pension system.

- 19 -

•

Addressing poverty. The authorities’ overall strategy in addressing poverty, which is
pervasive in rural areas, includes promoting the reallocation of labor from agriculture
toward higher productivity sectors, while improving productivity in the agricultural
sector itself. The latter is envisaged to derive from more efficient land usage, support
for increased mechanization, a reform of the food subsidy system, and efforts to
improve human capital among farmers. Rural infrastructure and access to credit are
being improved, which should help promote the development of rural industries and
services. In addition, the authorities intend to implement a universal health coverage
system, the details of which are being developed.
C. Exchange Rate and Monetary Policies

20.
The peg of the dirham to a basket of currencies has served Morocco well by
helping macroeconomic stability and keeping inflation low. Recent developments in the
exchange markets have also favored Morocco’s exports to the EU, Morocco’s main trading
partner, since the large depreciation of the dollar via-à-vis the euro has translated into a slight
nominal depreciation of the dirham vis-à-vis the euro.14 Morocco’s export performance in
2003 was favorable despite sluggish demand in the EU and special supply factors that
weighed down export growth.15 Thus, the mission and the authorities agreed that there was
no evidence suggesting a misalignment of the current exchange rate level.
21.
Money market conditions in 2003 were characterized by abundant liquidity in
the banking system, resulting primarily from the sizable balance of payment surplus due to
workers’ remittances and financial flows relating to the privatization of the tobacco
monopoly. BAM mopped up excess liquidity using deposit auctions and raising reserve
requirements, which limited downward pressure on money market interest rates (Chart 9).16
Credit to the economy, excluding that related to the privatization of the tobacco monopoly,
increased moderately.
22.
Money market conditions are likely to continue to be characterized by abundant
liquidity in 2004, fueled again by workers’ remittances and by the impact of new
privatization proceeds on government financing requirements. This would require BAM to
withdraw excess liquidity from the banking system. Based on the fiscal and balance of
payment outlook, the government’s position with the banking sector would worsen slightly

14

The euro has the largest weight in the currency basket to which the dirham is pegged. Consequently,
Morocco’s competitiveness may have suffered vis-à-vis dollar-zone countries.
15

These factors include a drop in the exports of fishing products due to the temporary ban on fishing, the
disruption of production in the country’s largest oil refinery because of a fire, and a bad tomato crop.
16

BAM elaborates a monetary program at the beginning of the year in coordination with the Ministry of
Finance. However, with the current exchange rate peg, monetary aggregates have largely been demand
determined.

and net foreign assets would increase further. Together with credit to the economy growing
broadly in line with nonagricultural economic activity, broad money would grow by
8.3 percent (Table 8). Inflation is projected at 2 percent.
23.
In the staff’s view, the ongoing integration of the Moroccan economy into the
world economy calls for a reconsideration of the current exchange rate regime. A
flexible exchange rate regime would better support the authorities’ growth objective by
helping reorient resources toward exports and minimizing the risks of increased economic
and financial integration. More specifically, the staff argued that a flexible exchange rate
policy would: (a) help to counteract the short-term effect of lowering external tariffs, since
the productivity gains stemming from trade liberalization and structural reforms in general
will materialize only over the medium term; (b) facilitate adjustment to the adverse shocks
that may hit the economy, since, otherwise, the domestic price level and economic activity
would need to bear the brunt of the adjustment; and (c) prevent undue reliance by foreign
investors on an implicit exchange rate guarantee. Thus, the staff encouraged the authorities to
start laying down the groundwork for an orderly exit from the peg over the medium term. In
this context, policy actions would need to focus on: (a) establishing a new monetary
framework that would provide a nominal anchor for the economy to replace the exchange
rate; (b) achieving significant progress in fiscal consolidation to limit the possibility of
excessive pressures on the exchange rate; (c) strengthening the financial sector by completing
the implementation of the FSAP’s recommendations both to limit vulnerabilities as financial
integration proceeds and improve the transmission mechanism of monetary policy; and
(d) develop derivatives markets to allow the hedging of exchange rate risks.
24.
The authorities indicated that they have been considering the issue of the
appropriate exchange rate regime to sustain their growth objectives. They were not yet
fully convinced about the merits of a flexible regime, but remained open to the idea. They
believe that their medium-term growth objectives are within reach regardless of the exchange
rate regime, provided continued progress is achieved both in structural reforms and fiscal
consolidation. They also believe that a flexible exchange rate regime in the context of a
surplus in the balance of payments could generate pressures toward a nominal appreciation,
with an adverse impact on competitiveness and growth. Moreover, they fear that a flexible
regime could generate excessive exchange rate volatility, since the Moroccan economy
remains prone to exogenous shocks. The authorities therefore requested a paper from the
staff on how an exit from an exchange rate peg would better support their growth objectives
and how in the process their above-mentioned concerns could be addressed to minimize the
associated risks. The staff acknowledged that these issues would need to be thought through
carefully, and agreed to prepare a paper which would provide a basis for future discussions
on the exchange rate regime.
25.
A new monetary framework with well-defined intermediate and operational
targets would need to be put in place to ensure that inflation remains under control
after exiting the peg. Under the existing exchange rate peg, monetary development are, by
and large, endogenous and play a limited role on the inflation outcome. Under a flexible
exchange rate regime, monetary developments would impact inflation more since the latter
would no longer be pinned down by the exchange rate peg. Thus, in the staff’s view, there is

- 22 -

a need to adapt the framework for monetary policy to the new circumstances, while
deepening the understanding of the relation between money and prices. BAM is of the view
that it already has the range of instruments and the institutional capabilities needed to
conduct an active monetary policy. BAM indicated that, independently from the possibility
of moving to a flexible exchange rate regime, it has already started to review its instruments
and operating procedures, with MFD technical assistance, in view of the enhanced
independence and powers that it will receive when the new central bank law is enacted.
III. RISKS FOR THE MEDIUM-TERM EXTERNAL OUTLOOK
26.
Risks to Morocco’s external position are limited over the medium term. Under
the scenario developed with the authorities, the surplus of the current account balance will
gradually decline as the impact of a recovering domestic demand on imports will more than
offset the pick-up in export receipts (Table 9). External reserves would remain high at nine
months of imports. The medium-term scenario cautiously assumes no significant increase in
the dollar value of workers’ remittances, and they constitute the main potential vulnerability
(Chart 10).17. The expiration of the Multifiber Agreement in 2005 will likely impact
Morocco’s textile exports, but ongoing efforts to restructure the sector and to diversify
exports are expected to mitigate this impact. The tourism sector has shown strong resilience
to the current security-related uncertainties, as evidenced by its performance despite the
Casablanca bombings. The current reforms that are being implemented by the authorities,
such as the liberalization of air transportation and efforts to develop tourism in key regions
and to improve the quality of tourism services, could further stimulate the sector. As a result,
tourism receipts are projected to increase steadily over the medium term.
27.
Vulnerabilities from external debt are low (Tables 10 and 11). Morocco’s external
debt has been declining and was close to 33 percent of GDP at end-2003. Under the mediumterm scenario developed with the authorities, external debt would gradually decline to
22 percent of GDP by end-2009 and debt service payments would decline by half to
7 percent of exports of goods and services and workers’remittances at end-2009. The
authorities intend to continue to limit external borrowing and to repay the remaining
expensive debt.

IV. OTHER ISSUES
28.
Morocco is making progress in improving the quality and dissemination of
statistical data. Recently, the authorities started publishing their international investment
position. Although Morocco’s database is sufficient for conducting surveillance, there are
still areas for improvements as identified by the ROSC mission. These areas include the
international reserves template and general government operations. Morocco is well
positioned to meet the SDDS specifications, as it already meets the periodicity prescriptions
and, with a slight improvement, would also meet those of timeliness.
29.
In the aftermath of the Casablanca bombings, a law against terrorism was
approved in May 2003. The authorities indicated that this law also covers the financing of
terrorism. A draft law on money laundering is being prepared by an inter ministerial
committee. The central bank has issued anti-money laundering regulations consistent with
international standards.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
Morocco’s structural reform efforts gained momentum starting in 2002 and
macroeconomic conditions remained strong. Economic growth picked up in 2003 mostly
because of a rebound in agriculture, but a recovery in private economic activity also appears
underway driven by investment. Inflation remained low, the external current account
continued to register a surplus, and foreign exchange reserves increased further. However,
fiscal performance was disappointing and the deficit widened. Nevertheless, with
privatization receipts, public debt continued to decline.

- 24 -

31.
The key challenge for the Moroccan authorities is to achieve sustainable high
rates of growth to reduce poverty and unemployment. Such growth rates will be pursued
in the context of increasing integration of Morocco into the world economy, which will
change the economic and financial environment. To take better advantage of the
opportunities in the new environment while minimizing the associated risks, macroeconomic
policies would need to be supportive and the structural reforms be implemented at an
accelerated pace with a view to improving the productivity and the competitiveness of the
Moroccan economy, including by promoting private sector activity.
32.
Fiscal consolidation is essential in the medium-term high-growth strategy. The
authorities are well aware of this and intend to reduce the deficit gradually to 3 percent of
GDP by 2009. While a multiyear adjustment appears appropriate, an emphasis should be
given to early implementation to provide room to absorb adverse shocks along the way.
Furthermore, a tangible progress in fiscal consolidation and debt reduction early on would
help assuage fears of future tax and interest rate increases and promote the much needed
private sector investment. Such a path would also be supportive of a somewhat more
ambitious reduction of the debt-to-GDP ratio, which the staff recommends. In this
connection, the authorities are urged to keep the fiscal deficit in 2004 below that of 2003 by
ensuring the timely adoption of the fiscal measures on which the projected 2004 fiscal
outcome is based and by stepping up tax collections and controlling expenditures.
33.
Sustained reduction in the fiscal deficit will require reforms on the revenue and
expenditure sides. Privatization should not delay reforms. Reforms to broaden the tax base,
simplify the system, and strengthen its administration would be needed to at least offset the
decline in customs revenue resulting from the liberalization of foreign trade. To this end, the
staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to develop an action plan with the assistance from
FAD and encourages the authorities to implement it expeditiously. On the expenditure side, a
civil service reform (with World Bank assistance) and an overhaul of the food subsidy
system would be required for durable cuts. The reform of the subsidy system should generate
savings, albeit these savings would be reduced by the need to strengthen the social safety net.
34.
The pegging of the dirham to a basket of currencies has served the Moroccan
economy well. Low inflation together with the depreciation of the dirham in nominal
effective terms have translated into a slight depreciation of the dirham in real effective terms
and the current level of the exchange rate does not appear misaligned. However, over the
medium-term, a flexible exchange rate policy would improve Morocco’s resilience to shocks
and enhance growth prospects as trade and financial integration progresses. Furthermore, a
move to a flexible exchange rate policy would need to precede any substantial steps toward
capital account liberalization to avoid implicit exchange rate guarantees. The staff welcomes
the intention of the authorities to examine the role of a flexible exchange rate.
35.
A move to a flexible exchange rate policy would require the establishment of a
monetary policy framework that would provide a nominal anchor in place of the
exchange rate, as well as durable reductions in the fiscal deficit and continued

- 25 -

strengthening of the financial system. In preparation for an effective functioning of such a
framework, there would be a need to further improve BAM’s monetary policy instruments
and develop money and exchange markets.
36.
The staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to continue with the recently
accelerated pace of structural reforms. While important progress has been made in
structural areas, continued efforts are needed to increase productivity and promote private
sector activity as well as to facilitate Morocco’s integration with the rest of the world.
37.
In the financial sector, the authorities are encouraged to press ahead with the
implementation of the FSAP recommendations. The upcoming promulgation of the new
central bank and credit institution laws should make it possible to pursue the modernization
of the financial system and monetary policy framework. Efforts to rehabilitate specialized
public institutions are encouraged, but it is imperative that these institutions comply with
prudential regulations as soon as possible. Furthermore, the finalization of the draft law on
money laundering should proceed in a timely manner.
38.
Morocco’s efforts to liberalize trade on bilateral and multilateral bases are
commendable. Nevertheless, the external trade regime remains restrictive and complex.
Thus, the staff encourages the authorities to continue their efforts to liberalize trade and to
avoid proliferation of tariff schedules that raise the complexity of the trade regime.
Furthermore, liberalization and integration among Maghreb countries would help establish a
large regional market and attract foreign direct investment.
39.
Broader public sector reforms remain important to improve the business
environment and enhance productivity. In this context, the authorities’ efforts to improve
the financial control of public enterprises and the financial position of the pension funds are
welcomed. Improvement of the business environment through better governance and
transparency is essential and the planned fiscal ROSC should help the authorities further
enhance the clarity of fiscal policy. The withdrawal of the state from sectors that are in the
private sector domain should continue. In this regard, the authorities’ privatization program is
most encouraging. Furthermore, in view of the implicit liabilities of pension funds and
implications for public debt, the intended overall reform of this sector would need to proceed
expeditiously.
40.
Morocco’s economic data base is sufficient for conducting effective surveillance.
Nevertheless, there are areas for improvement as identified by the statistical ROSC mission.
The staff welcomes the recent publication of the international investment position and
encourages the authorities to accelerate their efforts to subscribe to the SDDS.
41.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be conducted on the standard
12-month cycle.

B. Bound Tests
B1. Real interest rate is at historical average plus two standard deviations in 2005 and 2006
B2. Real GDP growth is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2005 and 2006
B3. Primary balance is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2005 and 2006
B4. Combination of 1-3 using one standard deviation shocks
B5. One time 30 percent real depreciation in 2005 9/
B6. 10 percent of GDP increase in other debt-creating flows in 2005

1/ Public sector refers to central government total gross debt
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign currency denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ In particular, the revenue ratio declines as trade liberalization proceeds and civil service reform is not undertaken
9/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
10/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and primary balance) remain at the level in percent of GDP/growth rate of the last projection year.

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
4/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
5/ This scenario is discussed in the text.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows
in percent of GDP) remain at their levels of the last projection year.

APPENDIX I

Exchange System
Morocco maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments
and transfers on current international transactions. Certain indicative limits apply for
invisible transactions and current transfers (i.e., payments for travel and personal payments),
but additional amounts are granted on proof of need. The exchange rate is freely determined
in the interbank foreign exchange market which was created in 1996. Bank Al-Maghrib
(BAM) intervenes in the market to maintain the exchange rate within its target range, defined
around a fixed central rate. The central exchange rate of the Moroccan dirham is pegged to a
basket of currencies representing Morocco’s principal trading partners. During 2001, the
authorities changed the basket of currencies by increasing the weight of the Euro to better
reflect the weight of external trade with EU countries. BAM fixes daily exchange rates on the
basis of variations of the currencies in the basket. Rates for most currencies quoted in
Morocco are established on the basis of the daily dirham-euro rate and the cross rates for
those currencies in relation to the euro in the international exchange markets. In
February 2004, the SDR/dirham exchange rate was SDR 1 = DH 13.54.
Article IV consultation
Morocco is on the 12-month cycle. The last consultation discussions took place in Rabat
during January 15–30, 2003, and were concluded by the Executive Board on April 28, 2003.

APPENDIX II

MOROCCO : FINANCIAL RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of March 31, 2004)
The World Bank’s portfolio in Morocco has a total of 14 active operations and 122 closed
loans, with cumulative net commitments of US$7.4 billion. Of this total, US$4.6 billion has
been repaid. Net commitments for the 14 current investment operations amount to US$319.5
million.
Despite the fact that the quality of the portfolio has improved over the last five years,
institutional capacity for project implementation needs to be further strengthened. A
participatory Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) took place in June 2002 and a
follow-up CPPR in February 2003 to tackle this issue through ongoing participatory
monitoring and capacity building activities. A quarterly portfolio review was carried out in
December 2003 to reassess the situation of the portfolio and progress made on key actions
agreed upon to improve project and portfolio management.
From FY99 to FY01, the Bank has provided extensive technical assistance through its
various lending operations for projects, as well as through its sectoral adjustment loans
(SAD). Three SAD were approved, amounting to $416 million, to support the Government in
establishing a sound macroeconomic framework and in implementing a broad reform
program covering public sector reform, private sector development, poverty reduction and
human resource development and telecommunications regulatory framework.
In addition, investment and learning and innovative loans (LIL) were approved during
FY99-03, amounting respectively to US$89 million, US$7.5 million, US$97.6 million,
US$5 million and US$30.9 million. They include assistance to: legal and judicial
development (US$5.3 million), Sustainable Coastal Tourism Development project (US$2.2
million), Irrigation Based Community Development (US$32.6 million), Support to Social
Development Agency project (US$5 million), Adult Literacy (US$4.1 million) and Rainfed
Agriculture Development (US$26.8 million) and are mostly designed with participatory and
community driven approaches.
Also, to move the reform agenda forward in areas where agreement was reached with
Government, the Bank developed intermediary products such as narrowly targeted, small
budget support operations. To that extent, the Board approved last June an operation to
improve Government’s management of real assets held by social sector ministries (Asset
Reform Management Loan, US$ 30 million).
As prospects for lending have been reduced, due to large privatization receipts (telecom
licence and privatization) and a deterioration of the fiscal stance, the Bank program has
increasingly turned toward knowledge transfer through participatory approaches. After a
number of policy notes on sectoral issues such as education, administration and the financial
sector, and related long-term prospects were prepared, the Bank has provided strong

- 42 -

APPENDIX II

analytical and institutional support to budget and public administration reform to the
Moroccan Government. Participatory approaches (Programmatic Economic and Sector
Work-PESW) have been developed in the area of public sector and price policy reforms.
Continued support through PESW is foreseen in the budgetary and public administration
reform, agriculture reform, tertiary education and decentralization and municipal
development areas.
Due to improved economic performance in 2002 and 2003, and plans to reduce the fiscal
deficit to 3 percent by 2009, the Bank believes that the country economic management
appears to be on a fiscally sustainable path. As a result of this, Morocco is now in a position
to engage in structural reform loans, as envisioned in the enhanced base case scenario of the
CAS. Such Bank support (adjustment lending) has been requested by the Moroccan
authorities for reform formulation and implementation in the areas of public administration
reform, financial and housing sectors.
The Bank is also developing in partnership with the Moroccan authorities a Sector-Wide
Approach operation (SWAP) to support the education reform agenda.
Two projects are scheduled to be negotiated shortly and be presented to the Board of
Directors before the end of this FY: a Rural Roads project (tentatively US$38 million) and a
Public Administration Reform loan (tentatively US$100 million).

APPENDIX III

MOROCCO—STATISTICAL ISSUES
Available economic and financial data have been provided to the staff on a regular basis and
most of these data are also published or made available on publicly accessible web sites.
In 1998, the statistical authorities prepared a medium-term strategy for the development of
national statistics. A framework law on statistics, providing for additional budgetary
allocations, was also approved but the law has yet to be passed. Following the Fund’s
multisector statistics mission in March 1998, the authorities started implementing an action
plan for upgrading the country’s statistical system and have received Fund technical
assistance on real sector, monetary, and public finance statistics.
A data ROSC mission, which took place in January 2002, carried out a review of Morocco's
data dissemination practices against the GDDS, as well as an in-depth assessment of the
quality of national accounts, CPI, PPI, government finance, monetary, and balance of
payments statistics. As the authorities maintain a strong interest in subscribing to the SDDS,
the mission also identified areas to be strengthened to meet the SDDS requirements.
Real sector
The Statistical Office is working on rebasing national accounts from 1980 to 1998 and on
bringing it in conformity with the System of National Accounts 1993. This reform program
has made good progress and is scheduled to be finalized by end 2004. The revision of the
consumer price index is equally planned for 2004 and will be based on the results of the 2001
household budget survey.
Government finance
Central government finance data are generally available to MCD with a few months lag. GFS
data reported by Morocco for publication in the GFS Yearbook are not timely (no data have
been submitted for the past three years), and their coverage is limited to the budgetary central
government, the Moroccan pension fund, and the National Social Security Fund. No data for
the central government on a monthly or quarterly basis are reported to STA for publication in
IFS. A technical assistance STA mission in February 1999 and a follow-up mission in
February 2000 advised on further improvements in the compilation of both central and local
government statistics and assisted the government in establishing appropriate consolidation
procedures for a presentation of general government data. Substantial progress has been
made by the Accounting Office for the compilation of local government data and their
consolidation with central government budgetary data. The actual use of those new rich
source data for general government compilation may require further clarification of
responsibilities between various directorates. Regarding the monthly Treasury’s expenditure
and revenue table, the ROSC data module recommended some reclassifications (transfers,
privatization), to maintain the Fonds Hassan II within the coverage of the table, and, for
dissemination purposes, to complement the table with more details and data on financing and
improve the format of dissemination. The ROSC mission generally recommended various
actions to improve dissemination formats and practices towards meeting the SDDS GFS
standards.

- 45 -

APPENDIX III

Monetary and financial statistics
The revisions introduced in 1998 improved the quality of monetary statistics, in a number of
ways. To further improve the dissemination practices, Bank Al-Maghrib launched its internet
website in December 2001, on which monetary and financial and other macroeconomic
statistics are readily available to the public. However, the timeliness of reporting of central
bank data (35–37 days lag) remains slower than that prescribed under the SDDS (two-week
lag). The authorities have indicated that the delay is partly attributable to the introduction in
January 2000 of a new accounting system for banks, more consistent with international
standards. Bank Al-Maghrib also has undertaken a revision of its own chart of accounts. In
addition, at the time of the January 2002 ROSC mission, the degree of detail in the
breakdown of financial assets and liabilities by resident institutional sector was insufficient,
resulting in a lack of precision in several aggregates, including credit indicators.
Balance of payments
The ROSC mission found that Morocco’s balance of payments statistics are generally in line
with the concepts and definitions set out in the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments
Manual (BPM5). Further work is needed to implement certain recommendations on scope,
classification, and basis for recording. Also, the ROSC mission recommended the
introduction of quarterly surveys of enterprises and other agencies to improve the scope,
classification, and valuation of balance of payments transactions, in particular for goods for
processing, transportation services, and financial transactions, where notable gaps exist. The
coverage of balance of payments statistics would significantly improve with the planned
inclusion of data on the transactions in the free trade zones and by offshore banks located in
Morocco. However, the Office des Changes (OC) lacks a firm legal basis for compiling and
disseminating balance of payments statistics, relying for the time being exclusively on
customs and exchange control data. These data are gradually becoming less available and too
limited as liberalization proceeds and foreign investors increasingly participate in the
Moroccan economy. The OC has initiated legislative measures that would permit the OC to
collect data directly from economic operators in order to compile, inter alia, private foreign
debt, and the international investment position. Recent measures to exclude the effects of
changes in exchange rates from the valuation of transactions in reserve assets should be
continued, and transactions in foreign currency assets and liabilities of intermediary banks at
their correspondent banks should be excluded from transactions in reserve assets.
Morocco meets or exceeds the GDDS recommendations in the external sector, except for the
twice-a-year publication of the external debt service schedule and the quarterly publication of
public and publicly-guaranteed external debt statistics. The quarterly publication of balance
of payments statistics is in line with the SDDS recommendations, but the time to disseminate
them exceeds somewhat three months. To reach the SDDS-based benchmarks, Morocco
would also need to publish monthly statistics on international reserves and foreign currency.,
The template on international reserves and foreign currency liquidity should be used and
disseminated.

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Morocco
On May 5, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Morocco.1
Background
Morocco has maintained macroeconomic stability during the past decade. In the context of the
exchange rate peg and prudent monetary management, inflation has remained low.
The external current account has shifted into surplus since 2001, and external reserves
increased further. Fiscal performance has however deteriorated in recent years mainly because
of revenue losses and wage expenditures. Nevertheless, the government debt to GDP ratio has
declined significantly because of large privatization receipts.
Growth has been insufficient to reduce poverty and unemployment. Furthermore, growth
remains volatile because of the dependency of agriculture to rainfalls, and recurrent droughts
contributed to increasing poverty in rural areas. Although nonagricultural growth has become
less vulnerable to developments in the agricultural sector and has shown signs of revival, it has
remained too low to reduce unemployment.
Structural reforms have gained momentum in recent years and efforts are being made to
improve social conditions. Large state-owned enterprises have been privatized and remaining
public enterprises are being restructured or prepared for privatization. Trade liberalization has
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.
1

-2proceeded in line with the schedule of the Association Agreement with the European Union,
Morocco’s main trading partner, and new trade agreements have been signed with the United
States, Tunisia, Egypt, and Jordan. MFN tariffs have also been reduced to avoid trade
diversion. A new labor code has been approved and is expected to improve labor relations and
foster investment. Significant steps have also been taken to reform the financial system. Efforts
being made to fight poverty and improve social conditions include the development of rural
infrastructure, the construction of affordable housing for the low income population, and the
passage of a family code that enhances the rights of the female population. The impact of these
reforms should be observed in the medium term.
Macroeconomic conditions remained strong in 2003. Growth increased to 5.5 percent because
of an exceptionally good cereal production, while non-agricultural growth showed signs of
revival. Inflation was below 2 percent and the external position strengthened further. External
reserves reached the equivalent of 10 months of imports of goods and services and covered the
totality of external public and publicly guaranteed debt. However, after improving in 2002,
the fiscal deficit (excluding privatization and including Fonds Hassan II expenditures) increased
from 4.7 percent of GDP to 5.5 percent in 2003. This deterioration resulted from a higher wage
bill due to salary increases and promotions for the education personnel, increased securityrelated spending after the Casablanca bombings in May 2003, and weaker revenue
performance on account of ongoing trade liberalization and tariff reductions on selected imports.
Nevertheless, because of large foreign exchange inflows related to the privatization of the
tobacco monopoly in 2003, the public debt to GDP ratio declined significantly.
Macroeconomic conditions are projected to remain broadly unchanged in 2004.
Under assumptions of normal agricultural production, overall GDP growth would drop to
3 percent. The external position is likely to remain strong with external reserves projected at the
equivalent of 10 months of imports and the current account surplus at 2.3 percent of GDP.
Inflation should remain subdued. The fiscal deficit is projected at 5.4 percent of GDP, broadly
unchanged from 2003 but significantly lower than projected by the budget law (6.8 percent of
GDP). Because of expected proceeds from privatization, mainly the sale of additional
government shares in Maroc Telecom, the debt to GDP ratio should decline further in 2004.
Executive Board Assessment
The Executive Directors commended the Moroccan authorities for maintaining macroeconomic
stability and accelerating structural reforms in 2003. Inflation remained low, nonagricultural
output accelerated, and foreign exchange reserves fully covered the outstanding public and
publicly guaranteed external debt. Despite a higher fiscal deficit, the debt-to-GDP ratio
continued to decline and structural reforms progressed on several fronts. These developments
contributed to improved market confidence in the Moroccan economy.
Directors emphasized that the key challenge facing Morocco is to achieve sustainable high
rates of economic growth to reduce unemployment and poverty. They observed that higher
growth in nonagricultural output will be essential to reduce the volatility of overall growth.
To achieve higher growth in the context of Morocco’s increasing integration into the world

-3economy, Directors stressed the importance of supportive macroeconomic policies and
accelerated structural reforms with a view to promoting private investment and increasing the
productivity of the economy. They congratulated the authorities for measures being taken to
assist the low-income population, noting that efforts to maintain social cohesion are an integral
part of the sustainability of structural reforms.
Directors considered fiscal consolidation an essential element of the medium-term high-growth
strategy, and welcomed the authorities’ intention to reduce the deficit over the medium term.
Several Directors favored an early start to fiscal adjustment in order to provide room to absorb
possible shocks along the way and to prevent expectations of higher taxes and interest rates
that could constrain growth. Such a strategy would also enable a somewhat more ambitious
reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio. Other Directors, however, felt that front-loading the
consolidation may not be necessary, provided that there is a clear and well-communicated
commitment to adjustment. In this context, Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to begin
to strengthen the fiscal position in 2004. They noted that the increase in the fiscal deficit in 2003
stemmed in part from lower import tariff revenues as well as an increase in the wage bill and
security-related spending. Therefore, they welcomed the continued freeze on net new hiring and
the provision in the 2004 budget for an early retirement program to reduce the size of the civil
service. Directors urged the authorities to step up tax collection and to move ahead in 2004 with
the planned reform of the food subsidy system, while ensuring that an appropriate social safety
net is in place.
Directors emphasized the importance of fiscal reforms for sustained reduction in the fiscal deficit
and the debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium term. In particular, they urged the authorities to
push ahead with their public administration and civil service reform plans in order to reduce the
wage bill on a lasting basis, and to streamline expenditure in the context of their ongoing efforts
to strengthen accountability in public management. A number of Directors supported the staff’s
inclusion of the Fonds Hassan II spending, which is excluded from the government budget, in
the overall fiscal balance in view of its direct impact on economic activity and its implications for
central government investment spending. Directors also welcomed the authorities’ plans to work
on a broad-based tax policy and tax administration reform that will increase the efficiency of the
tax system, reduce exemptions, and offset revenue losses stemming from the ongoing trade
liberalization. Directors considered the authorities’ request for a fiscal Report on the
Observance of Standards and Codes to be a very positive step.
Directors agreed that the current monetary framework has served Morocco well. They noted
that the nominal anchor provided by the peg of the dirham to a currency basket has contributed
to keeping inflation low, and that there are no signs of an exchange rate misalignment.
Nevertheless, they generally welcomed the authorities’ intention to review the desirability and
operational modalities of alternative exchange rate regimes before further opening of the capital
account. In this regard, several Directors emphasized that strengthening the fiscal position and
the financial sector are a higher priority at the moment and, in any case, are pre-conditions for
any eventual move to greater exchange rate flexibility as the economy becomes more
integrated with international capital and goods and services markets.

-4Directors agreed with the structural reform priorities outlined by the authorities, which will
complement fiscal reforms in promoting private sector activity and enhancing the productivity
and competitiveness of the economy. Directors commended the authorities’ decision to lower
import tariffs on a multilateral basis so as to minimize trade diversion and urged continued
liberalization and simplification of the trade regime. They noted that the trade agreements with
regional partners, the European Union, and the United States represent significant steps
towards increased integration to the world economy that would help attract foreign investment
and achieve improved efficiency and competitiveness.
Directors welcomed the importance given by the government to strengthening the financial
sector and the progress made in implementing the recommendations of the Financial Sector
Assessment Program. In particular, they supported the authorities’ intention to restructure
troubled state-owned banks and strengthen non-bank financial institutions. They also welcomed
plans to introduce new central bank and banking legislation in 2004 that would make it possible
to further modernize the financial system and the monetary policy framework, and to strengthen
the independence of the central bank. They welcomed the anti-terrorism legislation and the
central bank’s directives on anti-money laundering. They recommended that the draft legislation
on anti-money laundering, consistent with international standards, be finalized expeditiously.
To promote private sector activity, Directors underscored the need to improve the business
environment—in particular, to streamline administrative procedures, strengthen the judicial
system, and implement the provisions of the new labor code. They also called for further
improvements in governance and transparency, and a further withdrawal of the state from
sectors that are in the private sector domain. They were encouraged by the efforts to improve
the financial viability of the public enterprises, which would facilitate the ongoing privatization
program. Directors welcomed recent actions taken to improve the financial position of the
pension funds, and urged elaboration of a comprehensive plan to put the pension system on a
sound footing.
Directors commended the authorities’ efforts to improve the statistical system. They encouraged
the authorities to accelerate progress toward early subscription to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard.

Public Information Notices (PINs) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the
conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMF to the
public. This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies of member
countries by increasing the transparency of the IMF's assessment of these policies; and (ii) following
policy discussions in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board.

Statement by Mohammed Daïri, Alternate Executive Director for Morocco
May 5, 2004
Introduction
Morocco continues to make significant progress in modernizing its political and social
systems and strengthening the foundations for faster, private-sector-led growth. The coalition
government, appointed in November 2002 following the general elections, has demonstrated
strong commitment to macroeconomic stability and has strengthened the momentum of
reforms despite difficult circumstances. The terrorist attacks of May 2003 led to enhanced
awareness of the challenges and risks, stronger political consensus for social and political
reform and poverty reduction, and strengthened resolve of the authorities to press ahead with
their stabilization and structural reform agenda.
The local elections, held in September 2003, were characterized as fair and transparent by
independent observers and have led to a strengthening of the government coalition. The
fundamental reform of the personal status code to give equal rights to men and women and
strengthen child protection was unanimously approved, and new institutions were created to
strengthen human rights protection and the rule of law. An anti-terrorism law was also
unanimously adopted by Parliament. State monopoly on the audiovisual sector was
dismantled. The adoption of a new labor code, after years of negotiations between social
partners, should increase labor market flexibility and help further strengthen investors’
confidence and protection of workers’ rights. Indeed, in 2003, the number of industrial
disputes declined dramatically. The low-cost housing program was also strengthened, in
order to rehabilitate the shanty dwelling areas where extreme poverty is pervasive. The
February 2004 earthquake that hit the city of Al-Huceïma focused the authorities’ attention
on the issue of strengthened building standards, proper supervision of construction sites, and
on the need for social and physical infrastructure in remote and impoverished areas.
Given the long-standing political stability and policy credibility in Morocco, the terrorist
attacks did not affect investors’ confidence. The privatization of the tobacco monopoly was
finalized as scheduled in July 2003, with the sale price far exceeding expectations. Tourism
activity and receipts did not decline. A € 400 million euro-bond issue was successfully
completed, with a low initial spread of 215 bp, which subsequently declined to 160 bp, and
was used to retire expensive public debt. Morocco’s sovereign rating also improved, bringing
it very close to investment grade. After several years of decline, the stock market made a
strong recovery, with the index and market capitalization increasing by one-third, and the
transactions volume by more than 100 percent.
Macroeconomic developments and policies
Economic developments in 2003 were encouraging. GDP growth reached 5.5 percent, with
above average cereals crop, combined with continued expansion in manufacturing,
construction and public works, and services. The increased resilience of economic activity to
weather conditions has been confirmed. Chart I of the staff report indicates a declining trend

-2in agricultural GDP growth volatility in the last 5 years and a sharper decline in overall GDP
growth volatility. Inflation declined from 2.8 percent to 1.2 percent, and the current account
surplus remained above 3 percent of GDP, with continued high levels of tourism receipts and
a further increase in workers’ remittances. Official reserves increased to the equivalent of
over ten months of imports, covering the entire external public debt.
Initial estimates point to moderation of growth to 3 percent in 2004 based on the return of
cereal crop to a more normal level and stronger nonagricultural GDP growth. While weather
conditions, so far, have been more favorable than anticipated, the authorities have not revised
their growth projection. Inflation should remain at or below 2 percent, the current account in
a sizeable surplus, and the reserve position is expected to strengthen further.
The implementation of the 2003 budget was tighter than expected in view of the need to
reallocate spending in favor of security and key social spending and the carry-over of the
budgetary implications of staff promotions from 2002 to 2003. In addition, revenue shortfalls
from tariff reductions, including under the Association Agreement with the EU (AAEU) and
from MFN tariff reductions to limit trade diversion, were higher than anticipated. As a
consequence, while the overall deficit was 1 percentage point lower than budgeted, excluding
privatization revenue and Fonds Hassan II expenditures, it increased by 0.5 percentage point
over 2002. However, with privatization revenue representing 2.8 percent of GDP and
notwithstanding negative external financing, domestic financing declined by 2.2 percentage
points of GDP. Public debt further declined from 71.5 percent of GDP to 68.2 percent.
The budget deficit in 2004, excluding privatization revenue and Fond Hassan II expenditures,
is expected to decline by 0.5 percentage point of GDP, mainly as a result of lower spending
on wages and subsidies. Tax revenue should increase despite further reduction in tariffs
under the AAEU. The 2004 Budget includes the full year effect of last year’s security
expenditures as well as the cost of the increase in employer contribution to the public pension
fund and of the 2004 census with total impact of 0.3 percent of GDP. Including Fonds
Hassan II expenditures, the deficit would decline only marginally from 5.5 percent to
5.4 percent of GDP. The authorities are of the view that Fonds Hassan II expenditures, which
finance social and infrastructure projects and provide seed money for private investment,
should not be counted in the overall fiscal balance. They will, however, do their utmost to
further strengthen revenue performance and expenditure control so as to improve budget
outcome as has been the case in recent years.
Monetary policy was appropriately calibrated to maintaining low inflation in a context of
high domestic liquidity arising from large privatization revenue and high level of workers’
remittances. The surge in liquidity following the sale of the Regie des Tabacs was addressed
by Bank Al Maghrib (BAM) through raising the reserve requirement while, at the same time,
increasing its remuneration. Additional liquidity mopping-up was carried, including through
the newly created foreign exchange swap instrument. The prudent policy stance, including
the sterilization of half the privatization revenue, was instrumental in reducing inflation to
1.2 percent. In order to further strengthen the monetary framework and to add flexibility to
monetary policy, BAM created in early-2004 a permanent 24-hour deposit facility as well as
a weekly deposit auction system with a seven-day duration at a variable rate. The new central

-3bank law being discussed in Parliament will significantly strengthen available monetary
policy instruments by allowing BAM to issue its own paper.
The exchange rate peg to a basket of currencies has served the Moroccan economy well by
providing a nominal anchor for macroeconomic stability. The authorities are pleased with the
outcome of the restructuring of the currency basket in 2001. Following this action, and as a
result of the appreciation of the euro against the US dollar and the low inflation performance,
much of the earlier appreciation of the dirham in real effective terms has been reversed.
Consequently, and as pointed out in staff paper, there is no indication of misalignment of the
exchange rate.
The authorities are attentive to the appropriateness of the exchange rate regime for the
achievement of their growth objectives. They believe that all options should be carefully
examined, and their effects and prerequisites assessed, with due consideration to the structure
and characteristics of the Moroccan economy. Consistency between the exchange rate regime
and macroeconomic policies and instruments, the level of financial sector development and
degree of openness should be ensured. The authorities look forward to a staff paper on the
various options and issues involved.
Debt sustainability and medium-term fiscal challenges
Prudent policy stance and strengthened debt management have placed the public debt firmly
on a declining trend. Despite severe shocks, such as the “drought of the century” in 1995, the
declining debt to GDP ratio was only temporarily and moderately reversed. Total central
government debt declined by a cumulative 13.3 percent of GDP between 2000 and 2003, of
which 9.1 percent of GDP was accounted for by privatization revenue. Including the
elimination of domestic arrears accumulated at end-2000 following late receipt of the
proceeds from the partial sale of Maroc Telecoms, the decline in the broader government
debt over the three-year period amounted to over 16 percent of GDP, almost twice the level
of privatization revenue. The authorities are confident that their medium-term scenario
implying a further decline in the debt ratio is within reach. They will, however, seize the
opportunity of improvement in GDP performance in order to further lower this ratio and
improve debt dynamics.
The public sector debt sustainability framework indicates that Morocco’s public debt
compares favorably with those of emerging countries and is comparable to those of industrial
countries. Comparison with emerging countries is even more favorable in terms of external
debt sustainability, largely on account of prudent borrowing policy and active debt
management. The public debt remains within the sustainability range under various stress
tests, except when using two standard deviations for GDP growth in 2005–06 leading to a
decline in GDP of 7 percent per year over two years. The standard deviation is high
(5.8 percent), mainly due to volatility of agricultural production, itself a function of the
vagaries of the weather. However, from past experience, it is extremely unlikely that such a
sharp decline in GDP growth occurs two years in a row. From Chart 1, it is also clear that
real GDP volatility has significantly declined over the past five years. In addition, since this
volatility is mainly related to agricultural production, which is tax exempt, a decline in GDP

-4from lower agricultural production should increase the ratio of revenue to total GDP instead
of remaining flat, or even declining, as shown in Table 6 of SM/04/121.
This being said, placing the budget on a sound footing is a prerequisite for achieving higher
growth and employment creation and for strengthening social services and infrastructure
delivery. The authorities are cognizant of the large burden of wages and the ensuing budget
rigidity. Recent increases in the wage bill were part of the social dialogue negotiated in 1996,
which was instrumental in ensuring social peace during the political transition process and
creating the necessary environment for agreement on key issues, including the adoption of
the labor code and the consensus for social security and pension reform. It is the authorities’
firm intention to reduce the wage bill in the context of a comprehensive reform program
supported by the World Bank. Initial steps have been taken in stabilizing the number of civil
servants, starting an early retirement system—which will affect some 60,000 employees—
greater selectivity in hiring, and promoting staff mobility.
Improving the efficiency of the tax system will also be key to improving the budget position
in the medium term. The proliferation of tax exemptions has reduced the tax base and has
precluded much needed reductions in tax rates. Tariff dismantling, in particular under the
AAEU, is also expected to make a more significant dent in tax revenues going forward with
the reductions affecting highly protected products at a time when privatization revenues are
expected to taper off. However, trade liberalization could also help revenue performance
through higher growth and trade opportunities and, if supported by strengthening of tax
administration, could bring more of the informal sector into the tax net. Improved tax
administration and policy, and rationalization of and reduction in exemptions could play a
major role in addressing these challenges, and the authorities are looking forward to the
upcoming FAD technical assistance in this area.
Ensuring long-term equilibrium of the pension system is a major challenge for fiscal
sustainability and financial sector development. An assessment of pension regimes has been
carried out with World Bank assistance and options for their rehabilitation are being
considered. In the meantime, following the doubling of employer contribution to the pension
system of the military from 7 percent to 14 percent in 2003, the recent decision to increase
contributions from employers and employees to the main public pension system (CMR) by a
total of 6 percentage points over three years is a significant step. Internal pension regimes in
key public enterprises have been audited and their assets and liabilities, including the
necessary resources for their full funding, have been externalized. Measures have also been
taken to improve the financial position of a privately managed pension system, the Caisse
Interprofessionelle Marocaine des Retraites (CIMR).
Structural reforms
In the financial sector, most of the recommendations of the FSSA and the FSA reports, which
were published, have been implemented as indicated in paragraph 19 and Box 3 of the staff
report. The key reforms of the central bank and banking laws consistent with these
recommendations are being discussed by Parliament. Several reforms of the capital market
were approved, including new legislation regarding public offerings on the stock market and

-5the regulation of repos, and amendments to the laws regarding the stock market, the central
depository, mutual funds, as well as the strengthening of independence and supervisory
authority of the capital market oversight body (CDVM). The restructuring of the public
financial sector will continue aimed at its financial rehabilitation, clarifying its role,
improving its efficiency, and strengthening its supervision.
The authorities are strengthening the legal and regulatory framework for fighting money
laundering and the financing of terrorism. An anti-terrorism law which addresses also the
issues of terrorism financing was adopted by end-May 2003. Work is underway on the
money laundering issues which will be covered by a separate law. Meanwhile, drawing on
FATF recommendations, Bank Al Maghrib has already issued regulations to all credit
institutions under its supervision establishing the minimum requirements in terms of
customer due diligence, record-keeping, early identification of unusual or suspicious
transactions, and monitoring of financial transactions by selected businesses.
Progress in trade liberalization has proceeded at the multilateral, regional, and bilateral
levels. In addition to fulfillment of commitments under the WTO, the authorities have
concluded an agreement with the EU on agricultural trade. They have also made progress
toward a free trade agreement with the Mediterranean countries that have signed association
agreements with the EU (Tunisia, Egypt, Jordan). Moreover, a free trade agreement has also
been signed with Turkey, a further step toward an integrated Mediterranean area. A further
significant development is the signing of a free trade agreement with the USA, which will
improve market access to key Moroccan exports, while creating increased competition and
opportunities for investment and efficiency gains in several sectors of the Moroccan
economy. The authorities hope that improved political relations between Maghreb countries
would help unleash the potential for trade and economic cooperation between the five
member countries (Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia). In this regard, they
call on the Fund to launch new initiatives to identify opportunities for cooperation and
regional integration. While hopeful that the Doha Round will be concluded soon to the
benefit of developing countries, the authorities see these regional and bilateral agreements as
building blocks toward multilateral liberalization.
The Selected Issues paper on Morocco's trade pattern indicates both a trade creation effect
from the AAEU and the absence of trade diversion on the import side. However, this paper
is based on a gravity model, it is not based on actual data. Actual data show, in fact, that
there has been very large increase in imports from the EU in those sectors that have benefited
from the dismantling of tariffs, whereas imports of the same products from other areas have
stagnated or have even declined, indicating trade diversion. I expect that staff, as they have
stated, will look more into the data to reconcile the model findings with actual data. This
being said, the authorities have started reducing MFN tariffs to avoid trade diversion.
Improving transparency, governance, and the rule of law is viewed by the authorities as key
to accelerating policy credibility and enhancing investment opportunities. Key on-going
reforms include modernization of the judiciary, streamlining of investment procedures,
rationalization of budget preparation and execution, performance-based oversight of the
public enterprise sector, and increased market liberalization. The authorities’ request for a

-6fiscal ROSC is a further demonstration of their commitment to transparency. Private
investment is also being promoted through support of SMEs, acceleration of infrastructure
development and vocational training, and improved access to land. Together with further
steps in liberalizing the transport sector, these measures have significantly increased
attractiveness of Morocco to domestic and foreign investors.
The authorities also find the Selected Issues paper useful in analyzing the trends and factors
underlying workers remittances in Morocco. The findings that these remittances are
explained by altruism and attachment to the home country confirms the authorities’ longstanding view on the sustainability of these remittances and the very low risk for their decline
or reversal. These findings do not support the assertion in the FSSA that these remittances
pose risks to the sustainability of the external position. The authorities agree with staff that
Moroccan expatriates could play a useful role in investment, especially in development of
SMEs and transfer of capital, technology, and management expertise.
The authorities attach high importance to improving data quality and dissemination. They
have recently started publishing the international investment position and are reviewing
remaining steps to enable full participation in the SDDS. The 2004 census as well as a
consumption and expenditure survey will identify the demographic and socio-economical
characteristics of the population and inform social and economic policies. This will, in
particular, provide a snapshot of human development and a poverty map and enable a
rebasing of the consumer price index.
The authorities remain fully committed to sound macroeconomic policies and structural
reforms to increase growth and employment generation. They are confident that perseverance
with prudent policies and acceleration of structural reform will help unleash the large
potential of the Moroccan economy. They highly value the advice and technical assistance
provided by the Fund.
