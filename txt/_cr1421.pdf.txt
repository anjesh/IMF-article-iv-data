STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context: The overall state of the economy remains strong despite lower metal prices
and market turbulence in mid-2013. The economy is still operating somewhat near
potential and continues to be one of the most dynamic in the region. However, the pace
of growth slowed in 2013 as a result of external shocks and lower domestic confidence.
Headline inflation increased due to a combination of supply shocks and exchange rate
“pass-through” effects. The current account deficit has widened recently due to a fall in
exports. Against this background, fiscal policy provided a positive impulse, while the
Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) eased monetary policy to support activity and
allowed greater exchange rate flexibility to protect the economy from external shocks.
Perspective: The outlook is positive with balanced risks. On the upside, a faster
implementation of structural reforms and elimination of investment bottlenecks can
greatly increase growth potential. On the downside, unexpected effects of the
withdrawal of monetary stimulus in the U.S. could affect Peru through higher cost of
investment.
Near-term policy mix: The current policy mix is broadly adequate. With the economy
close to full-employment and inflationary expectations in check, a relatively neutral
policy stance should be maintained. Monetary policy should remain flexible as long-term
interest rates in the U.S. start to gradually rise. Fiscal stance should remain broadly
neutral, while the exchange rate should continue to show flexibility, strengthening its
role as a shock absorber. If the external environment deteriorates further, the authorities
have significant buffers that can be used to support demand to limit the negative effect
of an external shock on domestic demand. Additional macro-prudential measures could
also be employed, including those contributing to the de-dollarization of the economy.
Medium-term challenges: Over the medium term, the economy will need to adjust to a
lower growth rate in China (one of Peru’s principal trading partners) by fostering
productivity improvements and sustaining investment growth. It will be key to persevere
with the structural reform agenda to enhance potential growth prospects. Deepening of
the reforms is needed to bolster competitiveness through increases in labor market
flexibility, upgrades in human capital, the elimination of infrastructure gaps, and
fostering financial deepening.

CONTEXT
The economy continues to be one of the most dynamic in the region and is still operating
somewhat near potential. However, economic growth decelerated and the current
account deficit widened in 2013 to a large extent as a result of deteriorated external
conditions. Concerns about the unwinding of unconventional monetary policy in the U.S.
and weaker metal prices contributed to a deterioration of confidence, a weaker domestic
demand, and increased uncertainty.

However, the growth momentum slowed in
2013 mostly due to adverse external conditions and
a decline in domestic confidence. Following an
expansion of 6⅓ percent in 2012, economic growth
slowed to about 5 percent in the first three quarters of
2013 (yoy) due to a moderation in private investment
and a decline in exports. Net exports had a negative
impact on growth in Peru as well as in the majority of
the other LA6 countries.2 After the fall in metal prices,
uncertainty increased; and domestic confidence levels
dropped, reflecting also some concerns about the

Peru has been one of the best
macroeconomic performers in Latin America over
the past decade. Peru continued to be a leader in high
growth and low inflation in the region, which was
achieved through a prudent macroeconomic policy
implementation, a far-reaching structural reform
agenda and taking advantage of the benign external
environment.1 Not least due to these factors, the
economy came out virtually unscathed from the
2008‒09 global financial crisis, with growth rebounding
to 8¾ percent in 2010 and then being sustained at high
levels in 2011–12. Accommodative monetary and fiscal
policies played an instrumental role in supporting the
recovery, and were smoothly unwound as growth
accelerated and the negative output gap was closed.

Sources: BCRP; and Fund staff estimates.

The average growth rate of the Peruvian economy was 6.2 percent in the period 2002-13, the second highest
growth rate in Latin America, whereas the average inflation rate was 2.8 percent in the same period, the lowest in
Latin America.

The LA6 countries refers to the six Latin American countries that have adopted a formal inflation targeting
framework and have relatively more developed domestic capital markets. The list includes: Brazil, Chile, Colombia,
Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay.

direction of domestic policies. The turbulence in capital markets generated by the U.S. Federal
Reserve’s (USFR) announcement of a possible “tapering” of asset purchases added to the existing
uncertainty (Annex I). On the supply side, the moderation of growth in 2013 reflected a slowdown in
the mining, fishing and construction sectors. With domestic confidence indicators slowly improving
starting in the third quarter of 2013, the recovery will likely be gradual. Despite the economic
deceleration, the economy continues to operate somewhat near potential (although there is a very
small negative output gap), and real GDP growth is expected to grow at around 5 percent in 2013,
underpinned by a recovery of exports and investment in the last quarter of the year as well as
improvements in confidence as temporary supply shocks are being reversed (i.e., increasing fishing
quotas and fixing production problems in a large mine).
3.
The unemployment rate fell to historical lows. The unemployment rate declined from
9½ in 2004 to 6¾ percent in 2012 as labor participation rose (from 71 to 74 percent) and the
growth of working-age population remained stable.

The “pass-through” coefficient is relatively low in Peru. A VAR analysis with commodity prices, output gap,
exchange rate, and inflation as endogenous variables shows that a one percent depreciation of the nuevo sol against
the U.S. dollar is likely to raise inflation by about 0.1 percentage points over a year (cumulative impact). Thus far, the
exchange rate has depreciated by 8½ percent in 2013, which could generate an inflationary pass-through effect of
about ⅞ of a percent over a year.

in 2014 in line with the stabilization of oil prices. Inflation expectations remain well-anchored over
the medium term.
5.
Monetary policy was relaxed and macro-prudential measures were unwound recently
on evidence of a continued slowdown in economic activity. After keeping the policy rate at
4¼ percent for 2½ years, the BCRP cut the rate by ¼ of a point to 4 percent in November 2013,
citing slower domestic and global growth, and declining inflationary expectations. The cut was
intended to be preventive and to facilitate the recovery of the economy. Over the last few years, the
BCRP raised reserve requirements (RR) several times to mitigate the impact of the surge in capital
flows on credit expansion and the potential adverse effect on asset quality in the financial system.
Consequently, real private credit growth slowed from about 20 percent in early 2011 to about
11 percent in mid-2013. During the first half of 2013, the BCRP established a ceiling on average
reserve requirements on domestic liabilities and announced higher reserve requirements on foreign
currency liabilities if dollar credit expanded above established limits.4 More recently, however, the
BCRP began unwinding macro-prudential measures to ease liquidity flows following the USFR’s
announcement in May 2013 of potential “tapering” of its unconventional monetary policy.5

Exchange rate policy has been more flexible over the past year, although the BCRP has
intervened to limit excessive volatility in the foreign exchange (FX) market. In response to
large capital inflows in 2012, the nuevo sol appreciated by 8½ percent in real effective terms, while
the BCRP accumulated about US$15 billion FX reserves leading to a build-up of net international
reserves (NIR) to US$64 billion (about 32 percent of GDP). Most of last year’s FX purchase

The measure was intended to moderate the growth of dollar loans, in particular, mortgage and vehicle loans, the
central bank increased the RR on dollar liabilities by 75 and 150 bps if the balance of dollar mortgage loans and car
loans expanded by either: (i) more than 10 and 20 percent respectively with respect to February 2013; or (ii) 20 and
25 percent of the regulatory capital at end-2012 respectively, whichever amount is higher; while at the same time
establishing a ceiling for RR on liabilities in nuevos soles.

In particular, the BCRP took the following measures: (i) reduced marginal RR on nuevo sol deposits from 30 percent
in July to 15 percent in December 2013; (ii) reduced marginal RR on dollar deposits from 55 percent in July to
50 percent in August; and (iii) reduced average RR on local currency liabilities from 20 percent in June to 15 percent
in December, and established a 45 percent ceiling on foreign currency liabilities in August 2013.

interventions were sterilized through issuance of the BCRP securities, Treasury deposits, and raising
reserve requirements. Staff estimated that the cost of such sterilization was about ½ percent of GDP.
The BCRP continued with FX purchases through mid-April of 2013 to avoid undue volatility, but
since then sold FX to limit the volatility resulting from financial market turmoil associated with the
USFR announcement in May 2013. In these circumstances, the nuevo sol depreciated about
8½ percent, year-to-date, in real terms in the first ten months of 2013. The exchange rate remains in
line with fundamentals (Annex II). For 2013, the BCRP is expected to accumulate around US$3 billion
in FX reserves, increasing NIR to US$67 billion; most of the intervention is expected to be sterilized
through Treasury deposits, reducing the need for other (more costly) forms of sterilization.
7.
Fiscal policy became more supportive of the economy in 2013 given the challenging
external environment. The fiscal position strengthened considerably in 2012. The non-financial
public sector (NFPS) overall surplus increased to 2¼ percent of GDP in 2012 (more than double the
budgeted amount), mainly due to stronger-thanPeru: Fiscal Indicators

weakened. Public debt is sustainable and at below
20 percent of GDP (expected for 2013) remains one of the lowest in the region (see debt
sustainability analysis, Tables 10–11). Total financial assets of the NFPS are expected to reach over
15 percent of GDP by end-2013 (of which about 4 percent of GDP belongs in the fiscal stabilization
fund).


Diminishing surplus. The authorities presented their revised multi-year macroeconomic
framework in August 2013, lowering the expected surplus in 2013 from the budgeted 1 percent
of GDP to around ⅓ percent reflecting mainly higher expenditures due to ongoing public sector
reforms and projected full execution of investment spending and to a lesser extent lower tax
revenues from natural resources. Staff expects a marginally higher surplus on account of a
slightly lower execution rate of capital expenditures.



Fiscal impulse. Staff estimates a NFPS structural fiscal surplus (i.e., correcting for the business
cycle and high metal prices) above ½ percent of GDP in 2013, resulting in a fiscal impulse of
about 1 percent of GDP. In the absence of this fiscal easing in 2013, the economic slowdown
would have been more pronounced.



Acceleration of investment. The government announced two initiatives between May and June
2013 to enhance public investment performance and improve the overall investment climate
(Box 1). In particular, a special team was appointed within the Ministry of Economy and Finance

PERU

(MEF) to identify and reduce bottlenecks and speed up investment projects. Over 50 projects
accounting for around 10 percent of GDP have been identified and are under close monitoring
to ensure completion. A committee responsible for launching public private partnerships (PPP)
was also appointed; and a new PPP law will broaden the scope and modalities under which
these partnerships could be established.


Support for sub-national governments. In September 2013, support measures were approved
for local and regional governments to prevent interruptions in the ongoing projects affected by
the reduction in income from lower mining taxation earmarked to the regions. The assistance is
to be delivered in the form of transfers within the current budgeted expenditure envelope; and
by offering a credit line. The latter mechanism is available to all local governments that are able
to repay debt with future resource income.

8.
New legislation strengthening the fiscal framework was recently approved. The law was
approved by Congress in October 2013 and will be applied to the 2015 budget. The previous
framework (in place since 1999) served Peru well in reducing the public debt to GDP ratio but did
not prevent fiscal policy from being pro-cyclical, nor steer efficiently the management of
nonrenewable resources in the context of capacity constraints, nor provide for a balancing of
savings of these revenues against significant social needs and infrastructure gaps. The new
framework: (i) aims at introducing a counter-cyclical component to budget formulation;
(ii) strengthens accountability by introducing a fiscal council; and (iii) delineates better the
relationship and fiscal practices between the national and sub-national levels. The design of the new
fiscal framework followed the recommendations of the commission of experts appointed in 2012
(Box 2), and involved the participation of the BCRP, technical assistance from the Fund, and
independent experts to provide more transparency and commitment to the process.

higher interest rates abroad. During the first nine months of 2013, the terms of trade deteriorated

term capital outflows of about 3½ percent of GDP registered in the second and third quarters as
Peruvian banks used their liquidity position to reduce short-term external liabilities (Annex I).
10.
Despite the deterioration of the external position, the risks to the stability of the
external sector remained contained. Both the External Balance Approach (EBA) and the traditional
Consultative Group on Exchange Rate (CGER) methodologies indicate that the real effective
exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals, although some methodologies indicate a slight
overvaluation (Annex II). The level and composition of Peru’s international investment position (IIP)
has improved over the last decade as the negative IIP halved since the early 2000s and the
composition of foreign liabilities shifted significantly into non-debt items. Also, net international
reserves remain comfortable with respect to various metrics. Peru does not maintain exchange
restrictions or multiple currency practices subject to Fund jurisdiction (under Article VIII, Section 2 (a)
or 3), and their macro-prudential measures aim at enhancing financial stability, and do not
constitute capital flow management measures as the Peru has an open capital account.
11.
The financial sector remains solid and healthy. Banks remain in a better financial position
than their non-bank counterparts.


Banks. They account for almost 90 percent of the assets of the financial system. With capital to
risk-weighted asset ratios (CAR) of 14 percent, non-performing loan ratios (NPL) of 2 percent,
and return-on-equity (ROE) of 21½ percent as of September 2013, the banking system remains
well-capitalized, sound, and profitable. But with high dollarization of over 45 percent, the
banking system remains vulnerable to exchange rate fluctuations. To moderate risks, the BCRP
and the superintendency of banks (SBS) actively employed macro-prudential policies. To limit
the expansion of loans in U.S. dollars and encourage their substitution by credits in nuevos soles,
BCRP increased the RR on dollar liabilities during the first four months of 2013.



Non-banks. They represent over 10 percent of the assets of the financial system. While nonbanks’ exposure to FX risk is limited due to their low level of dollarization of about 10 percent,
their financial health has worsened recently, reflecting softer economic conditions (and despite
continued strengthening of lending standards) as their portfolios are highly concentrated in
consumer and small- and micro-enterprise loans.6 NPLs and profitability and provisioning
indicators have all been deteriorating lately. Nonetheless, they remained well-capitalized with
CARs ranging from 13½ for Cajas Rurales to about 18 for Empresas Financieras.

Peru’s sovereign credit rating was recently upgraded by two credit rating agencies.
Peru has had an investment grade rating since 2008/09. Standard & Poor’s (S&P) raised the
country’s long-term sovereign foreign currency rating to BBB+ (from BBB), and long-term sovereign
local currency rating to A- (from BBB+) in August 2013, whereas Fitch did the same in October 2013
(the best rating in Latin America after Chile). Both credit rating agencies said the outlook for the
rating was now stable. The reasons for an upgrade included continued robust growth, establishment
of a fiscal stabilization fund and buildup of international reserves, as well as improved fundamentals.
In the meantime, Moody’s maintained the Baa2 rating (with a positive outlook).
13.
The next electoral cycle is approaching against the background of social tensions.
Regional and municipal elections are set for October 2014, and presidential and legislative elections
are scheduled for April 2016. In the meantime, social conflicts have increased over the years, with
about 150 disputes earlier in the year involving extractive industries on the grounds of
environmental destruction and inadequate compensation to local communities. While many large
private mining projects are implemented as scheduled, the US$5 billion Minas Conga copper and
gold project in northern Peru, has been stalled due to social discontent, and is expected to be
reconsidered by the company in 2015.
14.
Previous Article IV consultations. There has been broad agreement between the
authorities and staff on policy issues in previous Article IV consultations. More recently, the
authorities increased exchange rate flexibility when confronted with external shocks, and approved a
new fiscal framework (to become effective in 2015), which eliminates pro-cyclicality and is based on
the structural fiscal position. These two policy actions were in line with staff recommendations in
recent Article IV consultations. Moreover, the authorities have embraced transparency in the
discussions by publishing the concluding statement immediately at the end of the mission so that all
stake holders are aware of the discussions, including staff’s views and policy recommendations.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 11

PERU

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
Fundamentals continue to be strong and buffers are ample to withstand adverse external
conditions. Risks are balanced, with upside risks being very conducive to growth, while
downside risks are expected to be manageable.
15.
The region is cooling off. Growth has been revised downwards for many countries in the
region and for some quite steeply, on the back of a less supportive external environment and
supply-side constraints. Overall, regional output growth is projected to hover around 2½ percent in
2013, (with most economies now operating broadly at potential), and at about 3 percent in 2014.
16.
The outlook for Peru remains favorable in the near term despite challenging external
conditions. Based on World Economic Outlook projections, China (one of Peru’s main trading
partners) is projected to experience an economic deceleration in 2013 (to 7½ percent) and over the
medium-term (to 7 percent). In the United States, the USFR has already announced the unwinding of
its monthly purchases of securities starting in January 2014, which will lead to higher long-term
interest rates in 2014. 7 All this will result in a lower external demand and terms of trade
deterioration of 3¼ and 1 percent in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Against this background, staff
projects GDP to be somewhat near potential in 2013, with growth slowing to about 5 percent
reflecting lower external demand and a slowdown in domestic demand. Real GDP growth should
rebound to 5½ percent in 2014 on the back of a rebound in exports as large mining projects are
coming on stream (Annex III). The authorities remain more confident and placed growth slightly
above 5 in 2013 and 6 percent in 2014. Inflation will gradually fall to 2.3 percent in 2013 and
2 percent in 2014 (the middle of the inflation band) as supply shocks unwind and the pass-through
effects of the recent exchange rate depreciation are absorbed. The external current account deficit
will decline in the fourth quarter 2013 on the back of a recovery in mining and fishing exports, but
will remain at about 5 percent of GDP in 2014.
17.
Short-term external and domestic risks are well balanced. The main external tail risk is
significant but should be contained given large FX reserves, ample fiscal space, and a strong policy
track record.


Domestic upside risks. Staff’s baseline projections were made under conservative assumptions,
thus the pace of the domestic economic recovery could be stronger than envisaged due to a
variety of factors, including: (i) the greater speed of operating at full capacity of large mining
projects coming on stream; (ii) the ability to implement faster large infrastructure projects in the
pipeline; (iii) the effectiveness of the investor facilitator office in handling a larger volume of
cases; and (iv) the faster adoption of the authorities’ reform agenda. Also, it is possible that with
relatively softer economic conditions, the recent macroeconomic stimulus could have a faster
effect on the economy.

The USFR announced on December 18, 2013 that it will begin reducing its purchase of assets by US$10 billion a
month to US$75 billion a month starting in January 2014.

and further decelerate growth.

18.
Medium-term challenges remain demanding given the uncertain global outlook. Staff
revised Peru’s potential growth slightly down in the context of a lower global growth outlook,
particularly lower growth in China. The lower growth potential stresses the importance of
accelerating structural reforms to gain productivity and enhance the capacity of the economy to
grow. Staff projects the economy growing at potential of about 5¾ percent and inflation at
2 percent over the medium term. While the current account will continue to be elevated in the short
term, it is expected to diminish over the medium term on the back of projected increases in mining
exports and stabilization of global growth. Overall, primary fiscal surpluses are expected to be
anchored above 1 percent of GDP, while gross public debt will remain sustainable and declining to
well below 20 percent of GDP, with net debt turning negative.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
With economic growth decelerating on the back of uncertain external conditions, the
discussions focused on: (i) near-term risk assessment and the appropriate policy mix,
(ii) triggers for implementing countercyclical policies and the use of buffers, and
(iii) addressing challenges in the structural area to preserve a strong growth momentum
over the medium term. It was agreed that the current policy mix was broadly appropriate
and that policy buffers could be used in a measured manner if additional turbulence in
markets emerges. Going forward, policies should be geared towards accommodating a
possible reduction of potential growth.

PERU

materialize, they stressed that their objective is to improve budget execution and to fully implement
the 2014 budget. If the 2014 budget were to be fully implemented, the fiscal impulse in 2014 would
amount to about ⅔ percent of GDP, which could pose a small overheating risk (as the fiscal
multiplier is likely to be low given that the economy is somewhat near potential).
21.
Over the medium term, staff continued to support small fiscal structural surpluses.
These could be in the order of ½ percent of GDP a year (measured under the staff’s methodology)
to address contingent liabilities and natural disasters risks (i.e., earthquakes, “El Niño” related
droughts, tsunamis, etc.) which are high in Peru, and also to maintain the relative size of the fiscal
buffers as the economy grows.8 The new fiscal framework constitutes an important step in reducing
pro-cyclicality of the budget process and in achieving an appropriate savings target from the
intergenerational and fiscal risks point of view. Staff recommended the structural target taking into
account the desired level of financial balances and public investment path. Staff also emphasized
that further scaling up of public investment over the medium term, should be in line with
enhancements in public financial management capacity, also at the sub-national level, in order to
ensure high rates of return for investment projects. The authorities understand the staff’s concerns
but they favor a structural deficit of 1 percent of GDP (the highest deficit allowed under the new
fiscal framework, measured under a methodology that is still to be decided).9 The fiscal implications
of this policy are difficult to evaluate because the authorities are still in the process of designing the
methodology to calculate the structural fiscal balance that will be applied under the new fiscal law.
Staff cautioned the authorities against implementing an unduly expansionary policy in 2015.
22.
The recent reduction in the policy rate was undertaken against the background of a
decelerating economy and weak business and consumer confidence. In staff’s view, the
reduction in the policy rate in November 2013 was adequate given that non-food/non-fuel inflation
was within the target (albeit on an upward trend partly due to pass-through effects), inflationary
expectations remained well-anchored, confidence was still recovering, and the economy had
weakened faster than anticipated. The BCRP will need to continue to be vigilant and implement
policies flexibly in 2014. Additional monetary policy easing should be avoided unless there is
evidence of a renewed economic slowdown since an undue monetary easing may compromise
8

The structural fiscal balance corrects for the business cycle (which affects non-mining revenues) and deviations of
metal prices from a long-term “shadow” price (which affects mining-related revenues). The key parameters needed
for the calculation of the structural fiscal balance are: (i) the output gap; and (ii) the “shadow” price of metals (to be
used in calculating structural mining-related revenues). Staff’s methodology uses a Hodrick-Prescott filter to measure
the output gap, and an 8-year moving average of metal prices (centered on 5-years backward and 3-years forward,
based on WEO projections) as the “shadow” price of metals.
9

A commission has been appointed to propose the methodology used in the calculation of the structural fiscal
balance under the new fiscal framework. The commission is expected to announce their conclusions by February
2014. Without knowing the methodology used by the authorities to measure the fiscal balance, it is difficult to assess
the policy of a structural fiscal deficit of 1 percent of GDP, as it could entail a positive or negative fiscal impulse. For
instance, if a heavily backward-looking price for metals is used to gauge the relevant structural price, it would entail a
relatively low “shadow” price of metals and relatively low structural revenues, which could yield a structural deficit
higher than 1 percent of GDP. In such a case, the authorities’ objective (a structural deficit of 1 percent of GDP) would
require a fiscal tightening. Needless to say, if the commission were to follow a methodology similar to the one used
by staff, it would entail—if fully executed—a fiscal impulse of over 1 percent of GDP in 2015.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 15

PERU

inflation objectives (especially as inflation is already near the top of the inflation band) and induce
capital outflows. Once the economy recovers, consideration should be given to unwinding the
recent policy rate reduction to prevent a buildup of inflationary pressures, especially since interest
rates abroad are likely to rise, creating additional incentives for capital outflows. An additional issue
for the BCRP to continue closely monitoring is the real estate market to ensure its proper
functioning and to prevent the development of bubbles (Box 3).
23.
The authorities have indicated that they would consider additional monetary easing if
the economy remained weak and inflation expectations low, but remained committed to their
inflation target. The authorities were of the view that monetary conditions could be eased through
lower reserve requirements to foster private credit growth or a further lowering of the policy rate if
the economy remained weak. The authorities argued that if long-term interest rates in the U.S. were
to increase, that would not necessarily lead to a change in monetary policy in Peru as the exchange
rate is flexible and would adjust. The authorities felt that higher long-term rates in the U.S. would
lead to a re-pricing of long-term Peruvian bonds but that short-term rates in nuevos soles would
likely continue to be anchored to the policy rate. The authorities also stressed that they remain
committed to the inflation target band (1–3 percent) and that they have been successful in
implementing the inflation targeting framework. The BCRP stressed that if they see any risks of
inflation going above or below the target band, they would act immediately to contain pressures.
Staff acknowledged the effectiveness of the BCRP in keeping inflation under control and within the
announced band for most of the period since the implementation of the inflation targeting regime
in 2002.
24.
Maintaining exchange rate flexibility has been instrumental in cushioning the
economy against external shocks. As the current account deficit deteriorated and private capital
inflows declined, the BCRP has become a net seller of foreign exchange while allowing the currency
to depreciate. In these circumstances, staff welcomed the higher exchange rate flexibility and
encouraged the authorities to continue strengthening the role of the exchange rate as a shock
absorber. Going forward, the exchange rate should continue to be driven by fundamentals, while
limited foreign exchange intervention could be necessary to limit volatility and contain excessive
risks to the balance sheets in a still highly dollarized economy (Box 4). Such intervention will need to
continue to be sterilized to prevent large swings in credit expansion and undue movements in the
interbank rate. Increasing exchange rate flexibility will create further incentives for the deepening of
the forwards (and other derivatives) market as the private sector internalizes exchange rate risks,
which in turn could support further de-dollarization of the economy.
25.
The authorities remain committed to maintaining a flexible exchange rate regime. The
authorities agreed with the staff’s assessment that the exchange rate is in line with fundamentals,
and stressed that they will continue intervening to ensure an orderly functioning of the FX market.
The authorities remain concerned about excessive volatility of the exchange rate in the context of a
relatively dollarized economy but adhere to a flexible exchange rate policy and do not target any
pre-determined level of the exchange rate.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PERU

26.
Macro-prudential policies should remain well targeted to reduce vulnerabilities. In
addition to the recent macro-prudential measures to deter the growth of dollar loans, there is a
need for measures to discourage un-hedged foreign exchange exposures. The high positive spread
between reserve requirements on dollar deposits and those on local currency deposits needs at
least to be maintained, if not increased, to discourage dollarization. This would put downward
pressure on dollar deposit rates and an upward pressure on dollar loan rates. In the event of
reversals of capital inflows, the authorities would unwind previous tightening of reserve
requirements (while maintaining the spread between dollar and local currency RR) to provide an
adequate level of credit to the economy. Regulatory standards need to continue to be strengthened
in line with Basel III recommendations while ensuring the provision of an adequate level of private
credit to the economy (Annex V). While the overall financial system remains healthy and strong, the
recent deterioration of financial soundness indicators for some non-bank deposit-taking institutions
warrants closer monitoring and supervision.

B. Spillovers and Triggers for Utilizing Buffers
27.

Inward and outward spillover risks are limited.



Inward spillovers are more relevant. They could manifest via capital flows through financial
ties to the U.S. and Canada, and to a lesser extent to Spain and Chile. Foreign banks (mainly
from Spain, Canada, and the U.S.) play a big role in the financial system, but are locally funded.
Inward spillovers could also take place via trade channels through commercial ties with China
and the U.S.



Outward spillovers are quite limited. They relate to regional trade with Chile, Colombia, and
Mexico (where the integration is increasing under the “Pacific Alliance”) as well as other
countries in the region (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, and Ecuador).

28.
The authorities and staff agreed that while vulnerabilities have increased, current
buffers are sufficient to address a variety of possible shocks. Preserving policy flexibility by
continuing with a good track record of appropriate policy responses to adverse circumstances
remains instrumental in addressing future challenges. Large buffers have been accumulated, taking
advantage of positive terms of trade and income windfalls, but also as a result of adequate policy
actions (Box 5). Staff discussed with the authorities the external vulnerabilities and subsequent policy
responses. There was broad agreement that there were two important external risks to the Peruvian
economy: (i) the uncertainty related to the withdrawal of monetary stimulus in the U.S. in the shortterm; and (ii) the deterioration in growth prospects in China over the medium-term.


Protracted economic and financial volatility in the short term. Unexpected effects in the
withdrawal of monetary stimulus in the U.S. could disrupt global financial flows and lead to
sudden stops and reversal of non-FDI capital flows to Peru. As done in previous occasions, this
would require the BCRP to deploy resolute actions to maintain confidence and ensure an orderly
functioning of markets. As in the case of the Lehman crisis, exchange rate flexibility and the use

of reserves and liquidity buffers, as well as conducting repo operations and dollar swap auctions
would help ensure liquidity in the financial system. Peru is exposed to non-FDI capital flow
reversals as non-residents hold a large portion of the public debt (although the amounts are
small compared to the reserve buffers). In the event of a sudden capital outflow that put
downward pressure on domestic credit and growth, a temporary fiscal stimulus might be
appropriate within the limits of the new fiscal framework. As monetary conditions are expected
to tighten in the U.S. in the next several months with the “tapering” of asset purchases by the
USFR, staff was of the view that this might put upward pressure on domestic interest rates in
Peru. In these conditions, staff felt that further monetary policy easing may not be appropriate
as it could fuel further capital outflows. The BCRP considered instead that they will continue to
manage an independent monetary policy, establishing the policy rate with the aim of achieving
domestic objectives, while continuing using macro-prudential measures to manage financial
risks, with a floating exchange rate.


Deterioration in growth prospects in China over the medium-term could be produced from
a re-balancing of demand in China towards consumption, leading to a global stagnation, a
reduction in external demand, a sharp deterioration in terms of trade (due to a decline in
commodity prices), and a slowdown of the Peruvian economy with deflationary risks. In this case,
the exchange rate should work as a shock absorber, although there are risks given the
dollarization of the financial system. Monetary and macro-prudential policies could be relaxed to
ease the adjustment cost, ensure proper credit flows, and to support economic activity. If there
is a more pronounced slowdown in Peru’s growth, a temporary fiscal impulse could be used
(possibly under the escape clauses stipulated in the new fiscal law) to smooth the path to a
lower growth trajectory.

C. Preserving Strong Growth Momentum
29.
A solid growth record and efforts to maintain a favorable investment climate have
placed Peru in a strong position in cross country comparisons. According to the World
Economic Forum’s “Global Competitiveness Report” for 2013, Peru retained its 61st position (out of
148 countries; and 3rd in Latin America). Macroeconomic policies and market efficiency are the main
strengths, while weak public institutions, weak governance, education, and infrastructure are cited as
the main liabilities. According to the World Bank’s “Doing Business Report” for 2013, Peru remains in
43rd place (out of 189 countries); however, the report mentions contract enforcement and insolvency
resolution as areas that remain weak. The processes for opening up a business and obtaining
building permits continue to be relatively inefficient, while a lack of urban planning deters
investments in manufacturing despite still competitive land prices.
30.
Important structural reforms are being implemented with the aim of improving
competitiveness and productivity. Staff stressed the need to prioritize and sequence structural
reforms. While the authorities agreed with the principle of sequencing, they felt that given the need
to strengthen potential growth in the near term, a multi-pronged approach was necessary, focusing

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 19

PERU

on infrastructure and education. As a result, they are trying to implement many reforms at the same
time.


A far-reaching civil service reform bill. This reform, which standardizes workplace regulations
and salary scales, increases training for staff, and institutes performance evaluations. The reform
has been approved by Congress, despite some opposition from state workers, and it is expected
to enter into effect shortly.



A reform of the private pension system. The reform aims at generating greater public access
and lower fees passed last year, but some aspects of the reform have been delayed. In particular,
the compulsory membership of independent workers (whose contributions were previously
optional, unlike salaried workers), was criticized by some civil society groups, and its
implementation was delayed by Congress in September 2013 for one year. In the meantime, the
SBS is implementing regulations which will facilitate their access to the system along with
revising investment guidelines for private pension funds.



Capital market regulation. Specific regulations aiming at reducing the cost of issuing new
securities has been approved, with legislation pending on strengthened corporate governance
and financial reporting requirements. Moreover, an initiative to align the taxation of capital
instruments across the Integrated Latin American Market (MILA) and the Pacific Alliance
countries is also in progress.



Improvements in labor market competitiveness. This process is being pursued, inter alia,
through an ongoing reform of Certification and Normalization of Labor Competition enacted in
2012. The goal of the reform is to reduce the high costs of employment not only through
improving the system of compensation, but most importantly through raising labor
productivity.10 The latter includes better training opportunities through education credits and
scholarships, enhancement in the quality of training centers, and increasing the share of foreign
workers in the labor force in the specialized career streams. Over the period of five years, the
authorities expect these efforts to improve productivity by 20–30 percent.



Measures to boost productivity. A number of other initiatives to strengthen production and
facilitate commerce are being adopted, including the introduction of credit insurance for exports
for small and medium-size enterprises and establishment of the fund for science, innovation and
technology. Reforms are also targeted at improving the national system of quality, and spurring
the development of the logistical services in the transportation sector.

Significant headway has been made in reducing poverty, child malnutrition and
broadening existing social projects while advancing new ones. As part of the national strategy
10

Non-salary labor costs to the employer are amongst the highest in the region. Depending on the type of the
enterprise, these additional costs of employment (which include transfers to the individual employee unemployment
protection accounts and up to three month salary bonuses) could range from 14 to 70 percent of the expenses on
salaries.

for inclusive growth, social agenda was pursued through broadening the existing projects (Juntos,
Cuna Mas, and Qali Warma) and advancing new initiatives to increase transparency, such as
designing a registry of beneficiaries. The number of beneficiaries of the conditional cash transfer
program increased from around 1 million in 2011 to over 1½ million by mid-2013 while its budget
grew almost 30 percent last year. The budgets of the other social programs to combat poverty have
also increased, which helped reduce child malnutrition to around 18 percent in 2012 from 28½
percent in 2007, and reduced poverty to 25¾ percent in 2012 from 55½ percent in 2005. There still
remain some challenges, especially in improving the system for targeting extreme poverty.
32.
Going forward, structural policies will need to continue to be implemented swiftly to
strengthen growth prospects over the medium term. Lower metal prices may slow
mining-related capital inflows leading to lower capital accumulation and potential growth, and
should be compensated with additional reforms to support potential growth prospects. Levels of
investment and capital accumulation in Peru have been relatively high by regional standards with a
ratio of investment to GDP at over 25 percent. Labor has been rapidly absorbed by the economy
and the unemployment rate is at record lows. Against this background, further increases in
productivity will be the main driver in preserving the strong growth momentum and achieving
convergence to the higher level of income of other economies in the region, such as Chile and Brazil
(Box 6).
33.
With tax revenue under pressure from the fall in revenue from metals, achieving
ambitious tax targets would require more resolute efforts. The institutional framework and the
comprehensive overhaul of the organization of the tax collection agency (SUNAT) were approved
last year, and good progress was made in doubling capacity, coverage and control process, which is
evident by the good performance of income and sales taxes. Work is ongoing in improving the
system of risk controls, especially in customs, better diagnosing the system’s bottlenecks and
improving information systems. Despite this progress, additional efforts are needed to continue
improving tax collections, reduce the high level of informality and tax evasion, and decrease
exemptions which amount to about 2 percent of GDP. The provision in the new fiscal law to publish
data on exemptions and contingent liabilities along with the budget documentation will increase
transparency and accountability.
34.
The authorities need to continue enhancing financial supervision and
macro-prudential measures to prevent the buildup of systemic financial risks. The dominance
of large and complex financial conglomerates in the Peruvian financial system could be a source of
systemic vulnerabilities and has contributed to the high interest rate spreads relative to regional and
income peers. In this regard, further enhancement of the macro-prudential policy framework
through the oversight of corporate and household balance sheets, and strengthening the legal or
regulatory framework for financial stability would be needed to further reduce systemic risk.
Increasing competition and easing access to alternative sources of funding through capital market
reforms would facilitate effective allocation of savings in the economy and help to reduce interest

PERU

rate spreads. In this regard, recent measures to reduce transaction costs in the stock market are
welcome and likely to have a positive impact in the development of capital markets,11 but further
market inefficiencies will remain and additional measures to strengthen the capital market through
creating a private offering regime for sophisticated investors with minimal requirements,
streamlining the debt offering regime, and strengthening the equity offering regime in line with the
recent technical assistance recommendations will help ease access to non-bank finance. The
creation of the MILA with the integration of the Chilean, Colombian, and Peruvian stock markets is
also expected to increase market liquidity and the spectrum of investible assets.
35.
All in all, perseverance in structural reform implementation would be essential to
preserve growth momentum and fulfill social goals. While the recent reforms should result in
higher productivity and friendlier investment climate, more resolute efforts will be needed to ensure
greater labor market flexibility, upgrade human capital, and define a comprehensive public
investment strategy. Reducing the economy’s informality, achieving ambitious tax revenue targets
(which aim to raise funds for social needs), and strengthening the judicial system will also go a long
way in bolstering growth prospects and ensuring all-inclusive gains in the living standards.

STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
The overall state of the economy remains strong despite lower metals prices and
recent market turbulence. Peru continues to be one of the most dynamic economies in the region,
and one with the largest buffers thanks to past strong policy implementation. With an economy
growing somewhat near potential, macroeconomic policies should remain relatively neutral, unless
additional turbulence in markets emerges or other downside risks materialize. Preserving policy
flexibility by continuing with a good track record of appropriate policy responses to adverse
circumstances remains instrumental to addressing future challenges. Risks are balanced. While
external risks are tilted to the downside, domestic risks are on the upside. Significant terms of trade
gains could be reversed if growth deteriorates in main trading partners, reducing income,
investment, and growth. Sudden stops and reversal of some (non-FDI) capital flows to Peru (due to
tightening of global financial conditions) could put pressure on the financial system and further
decelerate growth. While these risks are significant they should be contained given a strong policy
track-record, ample fiscal space, and large foreign exchange reserves. Aggressive implementation of
structural reforms and infrastructure projects should help offset these risks. On the domestic side,
large mining and infrastructure projects could be implemented at a faster pace thereby increasing
growth.

11

The authorities recently announced that the commissions on the Lima Stock Exchange will be reduced by
53 percent, effective November 2013, as part of the effort to reduce the transaction cost and attract more small and
medium-sized companies to the bourse.

37.
The fiscal objectives in the 2014 budget are broadly appropriate to maintain
macroeconomic stability. Staff estimates that instead of a planned balance, the outcome will most
likely be a small surplus (given past rates of expenditure implementation), which is counter-cyclical
(given an emerging negative output gap) and broadly appropriate given the soft economic
conditions at present. Staff welcomes the approval of the new fiscal responsibility law and the new
fiscal framework. Over the medium term, staff recommended to aim for small structural surpluses (of
around ½ percent of GDP a year) to address contingent liabilities and natural disasters risks, which
are high in Peru. When integrating the new fiscal framework into the budget process, it would be
important to take into account the aforementioned fiscal risks, as well as the need to close the
infrastructure and social gaps over time. A strong political commitment as well as the steady
implementation of a fiscal rule is equally important.
38.
With inflation expectation in check, a neutral monetary policy in the near term would
be appropriate, but continued flexibility needs to be exercised as global interest rates rise.
The recent uptick in headline inflation was caused by temporary supply factors, while inflation
expectations remain well-anchored. Staff stressed the need for the BCRP to focus on maintaining
core inflation in check. The BCRP will also need to exercise caution in managing monetary policy in
the context of a likely increase in long-term global interest rates.
39.
Greater exchange rate flexibility observed over the past year is welcome as the
exchange rate continued to be used as a shock absorber. The exchange rate ought to continue
to be driven by fundamentals over the medium and long term, while limited foreign exchange
intervention could be necessary to reduce volatility and to contain excessive risks to the balance
sheets in a still highly dollarized economy. Given external risks, intervention is more likely to be on
the sale side. Such intervention will need to be properly sterilized to prevent a credit crunch and
unnecessary upward pressure in the interbank rate. Increasing exchange rate flexibility will create
further incentives for the deepening of the forwards (and other derivatives) market as the private
sector internalizes exchange rate risks, which in turn could stimulate the de-dollarization of the
economy.
40.
Macro-prudential policies should continue to be well targeted to reduce
vulnerabilities. In addition to recent macro-prudential measures to deter the growth of dollar
mortgage and car loans, there is a need for measures to discourage un-hedged foreign exchange
exposures of households and corporations. The high spread between reserve requirements on dollar
deposits and that on local currency deposits needs to be maintained to discourage dollarization.
While the overall financial system remains healthy and strong, the recent deterioration of financial
soundness indicators for some non-bank deposit-taking institutions warrants closer monitoring and
supervision.
41.
While vulnerabilities have increased, current buffers are sufficient to address possible
short-term shocks. Increased risk aversion due to the “tapering” of asset purchases by the U.S.
Federal Reserve could lead to a reversal of capital inflows, necessitating the central bank to deploy
resolute actions to maintain confidence and ensure orderly functioning of markets as was done
during the global financial crisis in 2008–09. Slower global growth could lead to lower external

PERU

demand and deterioration in terms of trade, the exchange rate should work as a shock absorber,
although there are risks given the dollarization of the financial system. Monetary and macroprudential policies should be relaxed to support economic activity. If the economic slowdown is too
pronounced, consideration could be given to use a measured and temporary fiscal impulse.
42.
Resolute efforts are necessary to achieve ambitious tax targets. Staff welcomes the
good progress made in doubling capacity, coverage, and control process, which is evident by the
good performance of income and sales taxes. To bring Peru’s tax collections at par with other
emerging market economies, decisive steps will continue to be necessary in persevering with reform
efforts and in reducing a high level of informality, tax evasion, and exemptions.
43.
Recent efforts to increase the country’s growth potential and ensure inclusive growth
are welcomed. Progress has been made in enhancing competitiveness by reducing barriers to
investment and increasing effectiveness of the public and private sectors, further developing the
local capital markets, and reforming of the private pension system to generate greater public access
and savings. Social agenda was pursued through broadening the existing projects and advancing
new social programs to ensure inclusive growth. Further progress is warranted to boost productivity
through increasing labor market flexibility, reducing non-salary costs, upgrading human capital,
removing infrastructure bottlenecks, and strengthening institutions. Prioritization of structural
reforms, including through designing a holistic nationwide infrastructure strategy, will be key to
preserving strong growth momentum.

It is proposed that the next Article IV Consultation with Peru take place on the

Box 1. Peru: Initiatives to Speed Up Investment
Two investment incentive packages were launched in 2013 and directed at easing procedures to carry
out investments. The objective is to facilitate public and private investment, especially in energy, mining
and infrastructure, and cutting red tape. The main measures can be grouped into three categories:
(i) administrative enhancements; (ii) tax related incentives; and (iii) new legislation.
Administrative Enhancements


Creation of a monitoring team for investment projects. The team will aim at removing bureaucratic
obstacles to the most important infrastructure, mining, and energy projects.



Measures to facilitate the investment process. Adoption of measures to strengthen the capacity of
Indecopi (the institute that promotes competition) to penalize public entities and officials who generate
bureaucratic obstacles, while at the same time providing incentives for speeding up projects as a part of
the program to modernize municipalities.



Actions to promote the development of small and medium-sized companies. The measures
promote the use of negotiable bills, which gives greater liquidity to SMEs and makes payments from the
government more predictable.

Tax Related Incentives


Administrative directives to boost competitiveness. These measures greatly reduce the time required
by companies to take advantage of the early return of the VAT, and allow tax credits for research
spending and personnel training (for a three-year period, extendable thereafter).



Tax liability reductions for investments in public goods. The regime that reduces tax liabilities in
return for companies investing in public goods in certain areas was extended to public investment in
general. Previously, it could only be used for infrastructure works and in regions that applied levies,
surcharges and royalties. In addition, maintenance works and pre-investment studies are now also
included in the system. All projects will be approved a priori in the national investment plan (SNIP).

New Legislation


Certification of non-existence of archeological objects. This law reduces to 20 days the government
response to requests for certification of non-archeological items, which allows construction. If the
government fails to respond within that period, the request is automatically approved. In the past it
took around a year and a half for this certification to be issued.



Expropriations. A new provision separates the expropriation of an asset from the reparation payment.
It speeds up the acquisition of land for executing projects declared of public interest. This procedure is
expected to take a few months and it used to take between two and three years, requiring the approval
of ten different entities. The projects that have benefited from this law include the Interoceánica Sur
highway and the Chinchero airport.



One-stop-shop for environmental impact studies (EIS). The law establishes that the terms of
reference for the EIS must be ready in less than a month. This procedure used to take between one and
two years.



Stock market. This law reduces the requirements and costs for accessing finance through the capital
market for medium-sized and small companies.

PERU

Box 2. Peru: New Macro Fiscal Framework
The macro-fiscal framework embedded in the fiscal responsibility law of 1999 was very effective in
strengthening public finances and reducing public debt. However, while the dependence of the
economy on natural resources grew, the framework lacked provisions for counter-cyclical fiscal policy, did
not shield the budget from resource revenue volatility, and did not lead to higher public savings in the
period of record commodity prices. When measured by the correlation between the change in the cyclical
component of government expenditures and the output gap, Peru displays a high level of pro-cyclicality
compared to other emerging economies. Fiscal policy management has also been complicated by changes
in the rules regarding coverage of expenditures; frequent use of supplementary credits; the unpredictable
use of outstanding balances by sub-national governments; and the multiplicity of rules and their hard-tograsp nature (which is a problem particularly at the sub-national level).
A new macro-fiscal framework was approved by Congress in 2013. The Peruvian authorities appointed a
technical committee of experts in 2012 to assist them in revamping the fiscal framework. Based on its
recommendations, the Bill to Strengthen Fiscal Responsibility and Transparency was submitted to Congress in
September and approved in October 2013. The revised framework: (i) incorporates medium-term fiscal
objectives to be followed by every administration; (ii) introduces a concept of counter cyclicality into the
budget planning process by focusing on the structural balance; (iii) outlines a stronger regulatory structure
though a more comprehensive spending rule, the creation of an independent body to contribute to the
technical analysis of fiscal and macro policy, and corrective actions in cases of breaches in the fiscal rule; and
(iv) defines the scope of public expenditure coverage for national government and sub-national
governments, and simplifies and strengthens their macro-fiscal frameworks when it comes to monitoring,
provision of support and corrective actions. Some detailed provisions of the new framework include:


Structural fiscal objective. After general elections, the new administrations within 90 days of taking
office has to present a declaration of the macro-fiscal policy for the period of the presidential mandate,
with a numerical structural fiscal objective for the presidential period which cannot be a deficit higher
than 1 percent of GDP.



Budgetary implications. The limit of non-financial public spending has to be aligned to the structural
fiscal objective as well as the assumptions on revenues consistent with the business cycle and
commodity prices. The limit can be altered if spending in the previous year was less than budgeted. In
that case, the amount of subsequent year’s spending can be adjusted upwards by no more than
0.2 percent of GDP.



Countercyclical policy. If there is a positive or negative output gap of at least 2 percent of potential
GDP, the spending limit should be adjusted through transitory counter-cyclical measures which together
cannot exceed 0.5 percent of GDP.



Fiscal revenues. If measures are adopted to generate a permanent increase in fiscal revenues of at least
0.3 percent of GDP, the spending limit can be adjusted by the same amount.



Regional and local governments. The level of debt cannot be more than 100 percent of the average
total current revenues of the last four years, and the annual growth of non-financial expenditure cannot
be more than the moving average growth of annual revenues over the past four years. The governments
can only borrow under the state guarantee and only for capital projects.



Corrective measures. In case of upward deviations from the spending limit, corrective measures are to
be taken within two years if over-spending is below 0.5 percent of GDP and immediately if it is above
this threshold, with an exception of those years when there is a negative output gap of more than
2 percent of potential GDP.

Box 3. Peru: Are Real Estate Prices Misaligned?
Real estate prices have risen substantially over
the past few years. Since mid-2007, the price per
square meter of high-end real estate in Lima has
increased by 245 percent in U.S. dollar terms. Prices
in mid-market real estate have evolved in a similar
fashion. The BCRP has pointed toward robust growth
in income, employment, mortgage credit, and lower
real interest as key drivers.1
However, deviation of prices from fundamentals
has apparently been minimal.2 Estimating a cointegrated VAR (with real housing prices, real
interest rate, real per capita GDP, and
population) Cubeddu, et. al. (2012) found the
Peruvian housing market to be near fair values.
BBVA (2012) independently also noted that
prices per square meter in Lima were only
slightly above their equilibrium values based
upon real incomes, home supply, and
construction costs.
Traditional house price metrics also appear
be remain solid. Despite the increase in price
per square meter, the accessibility index (home
price/per capita income) compares well to other
markets and has remained stable over the last few
years. Moreover, the ratio of house prices to annual
rental income has increased slightly to 15½ in 2013
from around 13½ in 2010.3 While Peru’s ratio is the
second highest in the region behind Brazil (18), it is
low in comparison to North American and
emerging markets in Europe and Asia which range
from 22 to 28. Although the sales price to
construction cost ratio has jumped, the sales price to
land price ratio has declined, reflecting the
increasing price of limited buildable land areas in
and around Lima.

Recent prudential actions should slow mortgage credit and house price growth. Targeted prudential
measures—capital charges on higher loan-to-value mortgages, dollar mortgages, and second homes along
with higher dollar reserve requirements—have been implemented in 2013.
1

Mismatches in particular market segments together with limited land supply and infrastructure shortages have also put
upward pressure on prices. For example, more than 50 percent of effective demand is for housing priced below
US$40,000 while only 4 percent of supply goes towards this market according to the methodology of the BBVA report
(see next footnote).

Thus, current sale prices equal on average 15½ years of rental income. According to the Global Property Guide, a

Box 4. Peru: Currency Mismatches in the Corporate Sector
Currency mismatch of the corporate sector in Peru
declined significantly over the last decade. As part
of last decade’s economy-wide de-dollarization
process, the average foreign exchange imbalances of
non-financial firms in Peru narrowed substantially to
about 5 percent of total assets in 2012, from
25 percent in 1999 (excluding derivatives).
Nevertheless, the decline in the economy wide
average hides sectoral differences. In particular,
manufacturing, construction and large scale retail
(consumption) retain large FX imbalances of between
7 and 17 percent of total assets.
Private sector securitized debt denominated in
U.S. dollars has increased, but remains manageable.
Low U.S. dollar interest rates have increased Peruvian
firms’ appetite for issuing U.S. dollar debt. Since end2010, U.S. dollar denominated debt securities placed
abroad increased 2½ times, with a surge of Peruvian
firms issuing U.S. dollar senior debt notes in the
amount of some US$6 billion thus far in 2013. Overall,
Peruvian-issued international debt securities now stand
at about US$15 billion or 6⅔ percent of GDP. The
immediate-term debt service commitments are,
however, relatively small (about US$1 billion a year)
and unlikely to create balance of payments difficulties.

Strengthening macro-prudential policies through the oversight of corporate and household balance
sheets could help contain currency mismatch risks. While macro-prudential policies that are directly
targeted at risks emanating from the financial sector are welcome, systematic oversight of corporate and

Box 5. Peru: Income Windfall and Savings1
Commodity exporting countries across the world benefitted significantly from the recent boom in
commodity prices. Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), and Peru in particular, are no exception. In this
context, and on the back of improvements in their macroeconomic fundamentals, several LAC countries
experienced positive and large terms-of-trade shocks during the 2000s. In this regard, Adler and Magud
(2013) document that although quite prominent, these shocks to the terms-of-trade were not larger than
the events of the 1970s—though more persistent and more broad-based across countries. However, the
income windfall associated with these shocks (defined as the difference between actual real income and the
real income measured at pre-boom terms of trade) was much larger than in the 1970s.
In the case of Peru, the recent terms-of-trade boom started in 2003; and it is still ongoing. Over that
period, the accumulated increase in the terms of trade was close to 62 percent. The accumulated income
windfall associated with this shock is estimated at close to 8½ percent of GDP a year on average.

8/ Aggregate average rates (percent of GDP).
9/ Aggregate marginal rates, in percent of income windfall (computed on the basis of average saving and investment rates of 3 years prior to the terms-of-trade boom).

Against the background of very large income windfalls, it is worth analyzing how much of the
windfall has been saved. While average saving rates appear high, marginal saving rates (i.e., how much of
the windfall was saved) are actually low—and lower than in the 1970s, denoting a smaller saving effort than
in past episodes. For Latin America, the median marginal saving rate has been 45 percent, slightly more than
half of what was saved in the 1970s (i.e., 80 percent). In the case of Peru, the marginal saving rate, however,
has been above the median, at 75 percent of the income windfall. Furthermore, most of this saving has been
geared at increasing the stock of domestic capital, instead of improving the net foreign asset position—as in
most of LAC. The latter, however, warrants some caution. Historical evidence shows that real income after
the terms-of-trade boom ends is higher in countries that prioritized a stronger net asset position over using
the extra income of the boom to expand the stock of domestic capital too fast.

Box 6. Why is Peru Growing Faster Than Other Countries in the Region?1
Latin America has enjoyed robust GDP growth in the past decade, with Peru being one of the best
performers. However, there have been regional disparities. Commodity exporters (i.e., mostly South America)
have grown, on average, 4¾ percent a year since 2003, (compared to
Figure 1. Contribution to Real GDP Growth
(Annual average, percent)¹
about 3 percent the previous decade). These countries benefited from an

financial conditions. In contrast, non-commodity exporters have grown
6
2003–12
only about 2½ percent a year since 2003. Peru exhibited the strongest
4
performance among the first group, with growth reaching an annual
2
average of 6½ percent during 2003–12 (almost twice the average of the
0
prior decade), similar to emerging Asian economies.
-2

Labor and capital accumulation were the main drivers of growth in
the region. An output-decomposition exercise finds that factor
accumulation accounted, on average, for 80 percent of the output growth
among commodity exporters (Figure 1). Employment gains explain the
high labor contribution to growth. The high contribution of capital, in turn,
partly reflects favorable external financial conditions and high investment
(including FDI) in the primary sector associated with the commodity
price boom.

Productivity growth in the region mostly turned positive after
exhibiting declines in previous decades. This partly reflects the
expansionary phase of the cycle in these economies in 2003–12, as well
as some structural factors such as the movement of economic activity
away from the less efficient informal sector (Figure 2). However, in most
countries, TFP growth continues to be tepid considering cyclical issues
and comparing with emerging Asia.
In Peru, improvements in TFP played a key role in driving the
growth momentum like in emerging Asian economies. TFP
accounted for almost 2½ percentage points of output growth on
average during 2003–12. Furthermore, higher TFP growth—along with
increases in the capital stock—explains most of the pickup in
growth compared with the previous decades. After exhibiting
declines in the 80s and 90s, TFP growth turned positive in Peru,
reaching annual average rates of almost 2½ percent—one of the
highest in the region. The marked decline in labor informality has
played an important role in explaining this behavior.

region start to rise and commodity prices stabilize, growth of
physical capital is likely to moderate. Moreover, the contribution of labor will be limited by some constraints
associated with tight labor markets and, in some cases, demographic issues. In Peru, growth is projected to slow
down in the next years (reflecting both cyclical and structural issues), yet potential growth will remain among the
highest in LAC at quite robust rates.

Annex I. Spillovers from the U.S. Federal Reserve
Announcement of Tapering
The Shock
1.
The U.S. Federal Reserve (USFR) announcement of tapering asset purchases on May
22, 2013 rattled financial markets across emerging economies, including Peru. In Peru, the
exchange rate depreciated 5 percent and the 10-year local currency sovereign bond yield jumped
over 160 basis points in the five weeks period between May 21 and June 24, 2013, the peak of
volatility in financial markets. Although volatility has moderated somewhat in recent months, there
have been enduring consequences to capital flows, the FX market, corporate financing, and
sovereign bond yields.

The Spillovers
2.
Capital inflows slowed significantly following news of tapering, but there is no
evidence of reversals. Net capital inflows fell from 13½ percent of GDP in Q1 2013 to 4¼ percent
of GDP in Q3 2013, mainly due to a drop in FDI, a slowdown in corporate bond issuance in
international markets, and a reduction in short-term net external liabilities, while non-residents’
holding of sovereign bonds remained steady at about 56½ percent of total (see below). The overall
balance of payments was in deficit in Q2 2013 (-0.2 percent of GDP) and Q3 2013 (-0.8 percent of
GDP), due to both the deterioration of the current account deficit and the reduction in capital
inflows, for the first time since 2009.
3.
The impact on the FX market has been magnified by residents’ additional demand for
U.S. dollars. In particular, local pension funds (AFPs) rush to reallocate their financial assets into U.S.
dollars following the depreciation of the nuevo sol in May−June 2013, prompting the BCRP to

5.
The increase in 10-year local currency bond yields in Peru has been high compared to
the changes in most emerging economies outside the region. During the five week period
between May 22 and June 25, 2013 (when the U.S. 10-year treasury yield increased 78 bps), Peru’s
10-year local currency bond yield jumped 162 bps. Econometric analysis also shows that the U.S. 10year treasury yield has statistically significant impacts on Peru’s local currency bond yields. After
controlling for the impacts of other factors (including Peru’s CDS, sovereign spread, exchange rate
volatility, policy rate, and global volatility (VIX)), a 100 bps change in the U.S. 10-year treasury yield
is estimated to have an impact of about 91 bps, 93 bps, and 101 bps in Peru’s 10-year, 5-year, and
3-year local currency bond yields, respectively.1 The null hypothesis that the effect of higher U.S. 10year treasury yield to Peruvian 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year local currency bond yields is 1 to 1 cannot
be rejected at the 95 percent confidence level. During all the turbulence period, non-residents not
only continued to hold a large share of Peruvian bonds, but marginally increased their holdings
since April of this year, despite significant re-pricing and uncertainty.

1

A two-stage least squares regression of Peru’s local currency bonds on the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield and the other
factors mentioned above was used to derive the estimates in the text, using first lags as instruments to overcome a
potential endogeniety problem between Peru’s bond yields, CDS, sovereign spread, and exchange rate volatility.

Annex II. Assessing Balance of Payments Stability
Current Account
1.
Peru’s current account has deteriorated since 2006 mainly reflecting the import
component of FDI and despite gains in TOT. The TOT improved by about 4½ percent a year, on
average, during 2006–12, while the volume of exports grew marginally by about 3 percent a year.
Nevertheless, the trade surplus continued to diminish due to surging imports, which grew
11½ percent a year, on average, during the same period, driven by robust domestic demand. On the
other hand, about half of the mineral exports revenue is recorded as profit repatriation although
approximately half of the repatriation is reinvested. Consequently, the current account balance
deteriorated from a surplus of 3¼ percent of GDP in 2006 to a deficit of 3½ percent of GDP in 2012.
The deficit worsened further to 5½ percent of GDP through September 2013 as the terms of trade
deteriorated 3½ percent and exports fell 3¾ percent, while imports grew robustly at about
6¾ percent (yoy).

2.
The deteriorating current account deficit also reflects the widening of private sector
saving-investment gap. While the public sector in Peru is a net saver, unlike that in the rest of
LA6 countries, private sector saving-investment gap has widened substantially in part due to
booming investment (including FDI) but also due to low and declining private sector savings. In this
regard, encouraging private savings through capital market reforms and increasing pension
participations could help improve the external imbalances over the medium term.
3.
The current account deficit is expected to fall to about 3½ percent of GDP over the
medium term under the baseline scenario and at the current level of the real exchange rate.
Mineral exports are expected to grow significantly on account of the finalization of 4 large ongoing
mining projects (i.e., Toromocho by Chinalco from China, Constancia by Hudbay from Canada, Cerro
Verde by Freeport from the U.S., Las Bambas by Xtrata from Switzerland) with total investment of
about US$14½ billion (7¼ percent of GDP) by 2016. In particular, according to official projections,
volume of copper production and exports is expected to double in the next few years. On the other

hand, import growth is expected to slow down to about 6½ percent as the growth of domestic
demand cools off.

Exchange Rate and Competitiveness
4.
The real exchange rate appreciated significantly over the last several years, although
there has been some reversal in recent months. The real appreciation has been driven primarily
by nominal appreciations as the central bank’s inflation targeting policy has successfully anchored
Peruvian inflation to that of major trading partners. In 2012, both the nominal and real effective
exchange rates (NEER and REER) appreciated by about 8 and 8½ percent, respectively, in response
to large capital inflows. Weaknesses in export prices in recent months have reversed the
appreciations: the NEER and REER depreciated by about 3¾ and 3 percent, respectively, year-todate through September 2013.
5.
Meanwhile, cost-based indicators of competitiveness show that Peru is competitive in
mining, its major export sector. For instance, the average cost of producing a pound of copper in
2012 was US$0.88 in Peru, compared to US$1.49 in Chile, the largest copper producer in the world.
While Peru has such a natural cost advantage, the 2013–14 Global Competitiveness Report (by the
World Economic Forum) shows that inefficient government bureaucracy, corruption, restrictive labor
regulations, and inadequate supply of infrastructure remain key constrains to doing business in the
country. Going forward, addressing these challenges will be necessary to improve the country's
competitiveness further.

Model-based estimates show that the real exchange rate is broadly in line with
fundamentals although there are variations among the different methods. The current account
regression of the External Balance Approach (EBA) approach shows a current account deficit gap of
about 1 percent of GDP (or about ½ percent of GDP adjusted for under-reporting of exports due to
illegal gold mining) and a possible REER overvaluation of about 5½ percent (3 percent adjusted for
under-reporting of exports) for 2013. But the REER has already depreciated by about 3 percent this
year through September, correcting the estimated misalignments. On the other hand, the real
exchange rate regression shows an overvaluation of 10 percent, but the regression has a large
unexplained residual and the results need to be interpreted with caution. The traditional CGER
methodologies painted a mixed picture on the medium-term real exchange rate. The equilibrium
real exchange rate (ERER) method shows that the real exchange rate is broadly in line with
fundamentals with a possibility of small undervaluation, whereas the macro balance (MB) and the
external sustainability (ES) methods show overvaluations in the range of 8 to 13 percent (6 to
10 percent after adjusting for under-reporting of exports). Taking into account the recent
depreciation of the REER, the remaining estimated gaps are smaller.

Peru received large capital inflows during 2007–12, but faces limited risk of reversal
since most of the inflows are long-term and non-debt creating. Net capital inflows averaged
about 6¾ percent of GDP a year during this period, but the lion’s share of these inflows were in the
form of FDI (5 percent of GDP) and medium- and long-term loans (2 percent of GDP). Over twothirds of the FDI inflows (3½ percent of GDP) were recycled mining profits (reinvestment). Net
portfolio and short-term flows were very small (a net portfolio outflow of 0.5 percent of GDP was
partially offset by a net short-term inflow of 0.2 percent of GDP), but the former increased very
recently due to growing demand for external financing from the corporate sector to take advantage
of the low global interest rates. Hence, Peru’s susceptibility to external and financial instability due
to capital flow reversals is likely to be very low, in particular when taking into account the central
bank’s ample FX reserves.
8.
The authorities have employed FX intervention and macro-prudential measures to
contain the pressure from capital flows. During 2010–12, a period of particularly high capital
inflows pressure, the central bank deployed a number of measures including FX intervention
(purchases), raising reserve requirements, and encouraging outflows, to contain the potential
adverse consequences of a sharp exchange rate appreciation, which would affect balance sheets in a
still highly dollarized economy. Total net FX purchases by the central bank during this period
amounted to about US$26 billion (13 percent of 2012 GDP). The central bank purchased additional
US$5.2 billion this year through April. In addition, the average and marginal reserve requirements on
both local and foreign currency liabilities were raised several times between early 2010 and April of
this year and the limit on pension fund managers’ external investment was raised from 26 to
36 percent between June 2010 and April 2013 to encourage capital outflows. Consequently, the
impacts of the inflows on credit growth and asset prices were contained.

Peru’s economy is relatively
dependent on extraction and export of
natural resources (Table 2). In 2011, Peru’s
resource GDP constituted about 18 percent of
nominal domestic product, comparing to about
13 percent in 2001. In real terms, however, this
sector’s share of GDP has actually decreased
from over 15 percent to about 13 percent over
the same period. After growing at an average of
5.2 percent in the first half of the 2000s, the
sector’s growth slowed in 2012 to the same level
as a decade ago (3.5 percent). Exports of
minerals reached 13 percent of GDP in 2012,
growing 6 percentage points over the past
decade in value terms.

The strong growth in the minerals investment reflected a number of factors. Largely it
was due to favorable global metal prices, low cash costs of extraction especially copper, as well as
the country’s macroeconomic stability, judicial framework in the minerals sector, good investment
climate, and evolving engagement of the operating companies with the local community. In
particular, global metal prices grew at 16 percent annually on average during 2003‒12. Empirical
analyses show that investment in the minerals sector is significantly and positively affected by global
metal prices.3

Total private investment has been growing strongly over the last decade as well. Due to
the rapid growth of investment in the minerals sector, total private investment grew at an annual rate
of 13 percent on average during 2003–12, higher than the 10-percent annual growth rate of
investment in the non-minerals sectors. VAR models using global metal prices, exchange rate, and
private investment (on a quarterly basis, in real terms) suggest that a one-standard-deviation shock to
the global metal prices (about 8 percent in a quarter) is likely to raise total private investment by
about 5 percent in the following year after the shock.

The main channel that China’s growth spills over to Peru is through its impact on
global commodity prices, and hence Peru’s terms of trade (price effect). Peru’s terms of trade
(TOT) (not mineral export volumes) seem to co-move with China’s growth, suggesting that the
spillovers of China’s growth to Peru’s growth are likely to take place mainly through the price effect
instead of quantity effect.2

Deterioration in Peru’s TOT might lead to lower growth of investment and
consumption. The correlation between Peru’s TOT and investment growth is 0.4, and the correlation
between TOT and private consumption growth is 0.3. Empirical analyses suggest that Peru’s TOT
Granger-causes and has statistically significant effects on the growth of investment and private
consumption with one-quarter lag. These effects seem to operate mainly through the TOT’s impact
on domestic income and imported capital and consumer goods.

Notice that the spillovers through China’s FDI and portfolio flows to Peru are relatively small, as most literature
found, such as Jenkins, Peters, Moreira (2007).

5.
One percentage-point decline in China’s real GDP growth in one year is likely to
reduce Peru’s real GDP growth by about 0.4 percentage points over the year, mainly through
its impact on Peru’s TOT. A structural VAR model, including China’s real GDP growth, and Peru’s
TOT, exchange rate vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar, export volumes, and Peru’s real GDP growth as
endogenous variables, was used to assess the extent to which China’s growth spills over to Peru, and
identify the main spillover channel. The impulse responses from the model suggest that a onepercentage-point decline in China’s real GDP growth in one year is likely to result in a (statistically)
significant deterioration in Peru’s TOT, a significant depreciation of the nuevo sol, and a significant
decline of 0.4 percentage points in Peru’s real GDP growth over the year.
6.
In the medium term, a permanent slowdown of one percentage point in China’s
growth would reduce Peru’s potential growth by about 0.2–0.4 percentage points, mainly
through its permanent impact on Peru’s TOT. Potential growth of Peru and China as well as the
trend of TOT seem to co-move with one another. The Vector Error Correction Models (VECM)
suggest that a one-percentage-point drop in China’s potential growth over a year seems to
deteriorate Peru’s TOT permanently, and leads to a decline between 0.2 and 0.4 percentage points in
Peru’s potential growth over the year. Thus, if China’s growth permanently slows down to
7.5 percent from about 10.5 percent in the last decade, then this would likely bring down Peru’s
medium-term growth between 5.3 and 5.9 percent.

Annex V. Prudential Measures and Credit Development
Overview
1.
The proactive use of prudential measures has helped Peru to prevent the buildup of
financial sector vulnerabilities during the global financial crisis and the recent episode of
surges in capital flows. Private sector credit continued to grow at a robust rate even at the height
of the global financial crisis (at about 10 percent at end-2009). Early signs of excessive credit growth
during the recent episode of high capital inflows were addressed with prudential measures. In
addition to the standard capital, provisioning, and liquidity requirements, the Peruvian authorities
have employed macroprudential measures to contain the buildup of risks associated with currency
and maturity mismatches, interconnectedness and business cycles. The authorities also continue to
implement FSAP recommendations. At the same time, the Peruvian banks have easily surpassed
both national and Basel III prudential requirements.

Peru’s regulatory requirements have met most, but not all, of Basel III
recommendations on capital. The minimum regulatory capital to risk weighted asset ratio (CAR)
required by Peru’s Superintendence for Banks, Insurance Companies, and Pension Funds (SBS) is
10 percent, which is above Basel III requirement of 8 percent. SBS’s minimum required ratios for

currency in which credit is granted, establishing higher requirements for credits in foreign currency.

Peru’s financial institutions have already surpassed both national and Basel III
regulatory capital requirements ahead of time. Common equity capital ratios at deposit taking
institutions as of September 2013 range from 8.3 percent for banks to 14 percent for financial
companies, compared to Basel III minimum (plus conservation buffer) requirement of 7 percent for
2019. Tier 1 capital ratios range from 10 percent for banks to 14 percent for financial companies,
well above Basel III minimum (plus conservation buffer) requirements of 8.5 percent for 2019.
Similarly, total CAR range from 13.6 percent for rural micro-finance institutions to 17.9 for financial
companies, compared to Basel III minimum (plus conservation buffer) requirements of 10.5 for 2019.
Finally, the average leverage ratio range from 5.7 percent for banks to 12.2 for Cajas municipales
(municipal microfinance institutions), well above the 3 percent minimum requirement recommended
by Basel III.
4.
Peru is implementing Basel III liquidity ratio requirement, in addition to its own
existing requirements. Minimum liquidity ratio (LR) requirements, defined and calculated on a daily
basis as the ratios of liquid assets to short-term liabilities separately for local and foreign currencies,
have already been implemented since the late 1990s with the aim of containing risks associated with
both maturity and currency mismatches. More

Liquidity ratios at financial intermediaries in Peru are large and have easily surpassed
both national and international standards. LRs in local currency range from 30 percent at financial
companies to 51 percent at rural micro-finance institutions, compared to the minimum requirement
of 8 percent. Similarly, LRs in foreign currency range from 57 percent at banks to 87 at rural micro1

next 30 days outflows and the minimum of the next 30 days inflows and 75 percent of next 30 days outflows, to be at

finance institutions, well above the 20 percent minimum regulatory requirement. Although the new
liquidity requirements are not effective yet, average estimated LCR for the financial system as a
whole based on the Peruvian definition was 163 percent as of September 2013, surpassing SBS’s
100 percent minimum requirement ahead of the implementation period (2014–16).2 Only financial
companies have LCR less than a 100 percent, but at 83 percent their LCR is still higher than the
80 percent requirement by the SBS for 2014.
6.
On top of the standard provisioning requirements for non-performing loans, Peru has
introduced dynamic provisioning requirements to contain risks associated with the business
cycle. The dynamic provisioning regime, being implemented since November 2008, requires

Provisioning by Peruvian financial intermediaries is well in excess of 100 percent of non-performing

7.
Regulations aim to reduce FX risks through limits on FX derivative positions and
additional capital and provisioning requirements for foreign currency exposures. The SBS
limits banks’ FX derivative positions to minimize the exposure of their equity to FX risks. Current
limits on banks’ FX positions are: 50 percent of regulatory capital for global FX long positions,
10 percent of regulatory capital for global FX short positions, and 20 percent of regulatory capital or
S/. 300 million, whichever is higher, for the absolute value of net positions in financial products
derived from foreign currency. An additional capital requirement for FX exposures has been in place
since July 2010 (2.5 percent of firms’ exposure to FX credit risk which will reach 8 percent by the end
of 2015) to ensure that financial institutions internalize FX risks associated with loans to clients
without coverage. Furthermore, SBS requires financial entities, that in its opinion do not adequately
assess credit risk associated with exchange rate mismatches, to provision up to 1 percent of their
direct loans in foreign currency.

2

The excess liquidity buffer is in part due to high reserve requirements by the central bank, which is included in the
definition of liquid assets for LRs and partially (the reserves above the minimum requirement) in the definition of
high quality assets for LCRs.
3

The dynamic provisioning regime is activated when GDP growth surpasses certain thresholds relative to the
potential output growth.

The authorities continue implementing the FSAP recommendations on the oversight
of banking institutions. For instance, new regulations are being introduced to address
recommendations on developing benchmarks to evaluate the effectiveness of management and
tightening regulations on related party intra-group transactions. A draft Law is being coordinated
with the association of credit unions to bring credit unions under SBS’s supervision and in the
deposit guarantee fund.
9.
In addition to regulatory measures, the central bank (BCRP) uses reserve requirements
(RR) as a macro-prudential policy instrument. The BCRP imposes RRs on both local and foreign
currencies deposits and short-term external liabilities to contain the buildup of vulnerabilities
associated with capital flows in a partially dollarized economy. For instances, RRs were raised several
times during the recent episode of surges in capital inflows and are now being unwound to ease

WORLD BANK RELATIONS
(As of December 3, 2013)

A. Bank Group Strategy
The World Bank Group support to Peru is defined in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)
approved by the Board on February 1, 2012. The CPS is closely aligned with the Government’s
strategic vision of strong economic growth with greater inclusion and is focused in four strategic
objectives: (i) increased access and quality of social services for the poor; (ii) connecting the poor to
services and markets; (iii) sustainable growth and productivity; and (iv) inclusive governance and
public sector performance. The CPS also addresses cross-cutting issues such as those of governance
and gender. The CPS is a result of extensive consultations with government and civil society.
The indicative lending program is at about US$250 million per annum, reflecting Government’s
interest in policy reform support through Development Policy Lending and in reform
implementation support through an investment lending program. The strategy includes
development policy lending operations in the fiscal, social, and environmental sectors mainly
through deferred drawdown options.
Peru’s current lending portfolio includes 17 active projects with a commitment of US$1.8 billion and
an undisbursed balance of US$1.4 billion. The portfolio includes twelve investment loans, three
DPL/DDOs and one GEF grant. The areas covered by the existing portfolio are economic policy,
environment, social protection, transport infrastructure, water resources, among others. Examples of
projects include Basic Education (US$25 million), Higher Education (US$25 million) Regional
Transport (US$50 million), Lima Optimization of Water Systems (US$54.5 million), and Second Rural
Electrification Project (US$50 million).
During FY 12, there were no deliverables given that there was a newly elected Government, and a
review of the proposed work was carried out during that year. For FY 13, a new Social Inclusion DPL
(U$45 million), a new Social Inclusion Technical Assistance Loan ($10 million) and new Higher
Education (US$25 million) and Basic Education (US$25 million) projects were approved by the Board.
For FY 14, the first sub national lending operation is being prepared for Cusco in the tourism sector
that also includes waste management and risk disaster management components (US$35 million).
Other projects in preparation include Innovation in Agriculture (US$40 million), a new GEF project
for Guano Islands, and a project in Urban Transport for Cusco.
In addition, the Bank has an extensive program of analytical and advisory activities for FY 13−14,
including both economic and sector work and non-lending technical assistance. The economic and
sector work covers areas such as public expenditure, fiscal incidence, infrastructure, social sectors,
climate change, and housing and municipal financing.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PERU

Finally, the Bank’s TF portfolio (currently over US$23 million) complements other WB support in the
current core engagement areas of this CPS by providing valuable AAA and technical assistance. They
support the harmonization and alignment of funding from various development partners behind
core government programs.

B. Bank-Fund Collaboration in Specific Areas
Tax Reform and Fiscal Decentralization. Fund staff has taken the lead in assisting in the design of
tax reform. Jointly with the World Bank and IDB, staff has worked on drafting laws and regulations
for fiscal decentralization. The World Bank has also focused on the design and implementation of
decentralization of the social sectors and pro-poor spending policies.
Financial Sector. A joint FSAP was completed in May 2001. Follow up technical assistance to
implement FSAP recommendations has been given by both institutions. Joint FSAP updates were
completed in June 2005 and April 2011.
Public Sector Management. Bank-Fund collaboration has focused in the area of results based
budgeting, the implementation of a Treasury Single Account and modernization of budget
processes, institutions and information systems.
Customs Administration Modernization. A needs assessment mission was undertaken together
with the IMF to develop an action plan for modernizing customs administration. The joint team
presented a technical report to SUNAT.

RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK
A. Country Strategy
Peru’s current Country Strategy covers the period 2012–2016. The strategy has two pillars for the
Bank’s assistance to the Peruvian authorities: First, it will support their efforts to close the economic
and social gaps that still persist between urban and rural areas; and, it will support productivity gains
as the main basis for inclusive, and sustainable economic growth.
IDB’s strategic engagement with Peru focus on nine areas: (i) social inclusion; (ii) rural development
and agriculture; (iii) housing and urban development; (iv) climate change and disaster risk
management; (v) water, sanitation, water resources, and solid waste; (vi) energy; (vii) transportation;
(viii) public management; and (ix) competitiveness and innovation.
The implementation of the new Country Strategy is on its way. The Bank intends to work with the
government on a multi-sector and multi-annual approach of articulated interventions addressing, in
a coordinated fashion, various development gaps at the same time. Also, the Bank’s intention is to
diversify the instruments of support to the country. Innovation in instruments include service
contracts with the government in priority areas (“fee for services”), larger private sector operations,
and extended use of knowledge sharing and technical cooperation.
The Bank’s financial engagement scenario would entail positive but small average net flows to the
country between 2012 and 2016. In the base scenario, the Bank will maintain its share as a creditor
in Peru’s total multilateral debt. The lending framework for the strategy is consistent with the
demand assumptions and the external financing strategy of the government.

B. Lending
As of November 2013, the Bank’s portfolio of active, public sector operations consisted of 24 loans
for a total amount of US$712.3 million, of which US$259.8 million (36.5 percent) had been disbursed.
The public sector lending program for 2013 has comprised six operations for a total of
US$150 million. In addition, on December 2013 the Bank expects to approve a contingency program
for natural disaster for US$300 million. The public sector lending program for 2014 comprises three
policy-based loans for US$75 million and seven investment loans for US$480 million which includes
the financing the Lima Metro Subway for US$300 million.
Regarding private sector operations, the Structured Corporate Finance Department’s (SCF) portfolio
in execution consists of four operations amounting to US$185 million in infrastructure and financial
services, the IIC portfolio comprises 20 operations for US$159.5 million, primarily in manufacture
and financial services, and the Opportunities for the Majority (OMJ) department portfolio consists of
two operations amounting US$35 million, in the housing sector and education.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PERU

As of November 2013 disbursement for SCF & OMJ total has been US$98 million.
Private sector lending for 2014 includes two SCF projects for US$102.5 million in agriculture sector

STATISTICAL ISSUES
A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: The economic database is generally comprehensive and of high quality, and data provision
is adequate for surveillance.
Despite progress in recent years, there is scope for improvement in the following areas:
(i) coordination among the agencies that compile official statistics to avoid duplication of efforts;
(ii) implementing a new benchmark and base year for GDP; (iii) expanding the coverage of the
wholesale price index to include mining, oil and gas extraction, electricity and water, public
transportation, and communication; (iv) finalizing the migration to the standardized report forms for
monetary data [with the introduction of report forms for the central bank, other depository
corporations, and other financial corporations]; and (v) expanding the scope of data sources for
compiling financial flows of individual residents.
Real sector statistics:
National accounts. The authorities published a revised GDP series in 2000. The series used the 1994
benchmark estimates as the base year, and included input-output tables. However, due to limited
availability of periodic source data, estimates after 1994 are largely based on extrapolation
techniques. The lack of current detailed tables for supply and use hampers the reconciliation of
discrepancies. As a result, changes in inventories are mainly determined as a residual. Although the
quarterly accounts have benefited from some improvements in the timeliness of monthly
production indices, coverage is still very limited. The National Statistics Office (INEI) is working on a
new national account series implementing the 1993 SNA and using 2007 as the base year. Four
national accounts statistics missions visited the country in November 2008, May 2009, September
2009, and September 2010. The missions were aimed at assisting the authorities in compiling the
complete set of national accounts by institutional sectors, and in developing the sequence of
accounts of nonfinancial corporations. More technical assistance will be needed in the coming years.
Labor market statistics. The authorities monitor labor market developments using four indicators:
open unemployment, underemployment, employment, and remunerations. While monthly
unemployment, employment and income data for metropolitan area of Lima from INEI are timely,
only urban employment indexes are available from the Ministry of Labor for other areas and with
some delays; monthly remuneration data for the government are timely but the monthly
remuneration data for the private sector are no longer available. The nationwide unemployment and
underemployment situation is surveyed quarterly. It would be useful to expand the coverage of
labor statistics to national level and develop competitiveness indicators such as productivity and unit
labor cost indexes.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PERU

Price Statistics: At the present time, the official measure of inflation for Peru is the CPI for
Metropolitan Lima, compiled and published by INEI. Starting in January 2010, the Metropolitan Lima
CPI has been compiled using updated weights based on the 2008/09 Encuesta Nacional de
Presupuestos Familiares (ENAPREF). Since January 2011, city level indices have been compiled and
disseminated for the 24 departmental capitals and another large urban area using weights from the
2008/09 ENAPREF and a methodology matching that employed for the Metropolitan Lima CPI. A
new law issued in 2009 requires the INEI to compile a new national level CPI that will serve as the
official CPI for Peru in the future. An STA mission on the CPI was conducted in May 2–13, 2011 to
evaluate the methodology of the new national CPI index. The new national level CPI, starting with
January 2012, was disseminated since from February 2012, but it is not yet used as the official CPI
for policy purposes. The statistical techniques used to compile the wholesale price index (WPI)
generally follow international standards but its weights that were derived from the 1994 inputoutput table and other reports and publications of relevant ministries, are outdated.
Government Finance Statistics: The Central Bank (BCRP) compiles government finance statistics
(GFS) following the GFSM2001, for the general government and its subsectors. Data for all
subsectors are reported on a cash basis and financial assets and liabilities are reported at face value.
The authorities have not yet sent to the Fund information on the components of expenditures by
function. The coverage of published national budget data is narrower than the fiscal statistics
prepared for the combined public sector. The new budget, aligned to GFSM 2001, was used for the
2009 budget processing.
Monetary and Financial Statistics:
Monetary statistics. The BCRP compiles and publishes the analytical accounts of the central bank,
depository corporations, and financial corporations broadly in line with the methodology
recommended by the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. The main divergences are the
exclusion of the deposits of other financial corporations, state and local governments, and public
nonfinancial corporations from the definition of broad money; and valuation of some financial
assets held to maturity at cost rather than at market prices or at the lower of cost or market price for
investment securities. At the request of the authorities, two missions visited the country in January
2007 and September 2008 to assist with the introduction of the standardized report forms (SRFs) for
the central bank and other depository corporations (ODCs) for reporting monetary data to the IMF.
The BCRP reported test data for the central bank in the SRF in July 2013 and it is expected that test
data in the SRF for the ODCs will be submitted to STA by December 2013.
Financial soundness indicators. Peru started reporting twelve core and nine encouraged financial
soundness indicators (FSIs) in June 2011 with quarterly frequency, beginning with data for
December 2010.
External Sector Statistics: The BCRP prepares quarterly data on the balance of payments and
international investment position largely in line with the recommendations of the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). Departures from BPM5 include the lack of coverage of assets

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

PERU

held abroad and land acquisition abroad by residents; and not recording on an accrual basis some
external debt transactions. Since August 2001, the BCRP has been reporting weekly data on
international reserves in accordance with the Operational Guidelines for the Data Template on
International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity. Since August 2006, the BCRP is including the
full amount of the liquidity requirements in the reserve template both under official reserve assets
and as a contingent net drain (as specified in Section III of the Data Template). Peru disseminates
quarterly data on external debt with an eight week lag on the National Summary Data Page with a
hyperlink to the Fund’s website.

B. Data Standards and Quality
Peru subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since August 1996. A data ROSC
was disseminated in 2003.

C. Reporting to Fund for publication:
The authorities report data for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY)
using the GFSM 2001. No high frequency data are reported for publication in International Financial
Statistics (IFS). External Sector Statistics are reported to the Fund for publication in the IFS and the
Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Peru
On January 24, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Peru, and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal without a
meeting.1,2
Peru’s economy continues to be a leader in high growth and low inflation in the region, which
has been achieved through a prudent macroeconomic policy implementation, a far-reaching
structural reform agenda and taking advantage of the benign external environment. No least due
to these factors, the economy came out virtually unscathed from the 2008‒09 global financial
crisis, with growth rebounding to 8.8 percent in 2010 and then being sustained at high levels in
2011–12. After reaching 4.7 percent in 2011, end-period inflation fell to 2.6 percent in 2012,
within the 1-3 percent target range. Stimulative monetary and fiscal policies played an
instrumental role in supporting the recovery, and were smoothly unwound as growth accelerated
and the negative output gap was closed.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually

every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.
2

Article IV consultations are concluded without a Board meeting when the following conditions apply: (i) there

are no acute or significant risks, or general policy issues requiring Board discussion; (ii) policies or circumstances
are unlikely to have significant regional or global impact; (iii) in the event a parallel program review is being
completed, it is also being completed on a lapse-of-time basis; and (iv) the use of Fund resources is not under
discussion or anticipated.”

Activity has slowed this year on the heels of adverse external shocks and a decline in domestic
confidence. Real GDP is expected to have grown around 5 percent in 2013, underpinned by a
recovery of exports and investment in the last quarter of the year as well as improvements in
confidence as temporary supply shocks are being reversed. Inflation remained within the 1-3
percent target range, reaching 2.9 percent by end-2013 due to increases in food and fuel prices
and some pass-through from the exchange rate depreciation. Private credit growth slowed in real
terms to 12.5 percent at end-2012 (from 14.0 percent at end-2011) due to macro-prudential
measures aimed at mitigating the impacts of surges in capital flows. The financial sector remains
sound, profitable and well-capitalized, supported by the authorities’ pro-active use of prudential
measures.
The outlook remains favorable in the near term despite challenging external conditions. The
projected growth deceleration in China (one of Peru’s main trading partners) and the unwinding
of monthly purchases of securities by the U.S. Federal Reserve will result in a lower external
demand and terms of trade deterioration. Against this background, real GDP growth is projected
to be 5.5 percent in 2014, slightly below potential, while inflation is projected to decline to
about 2.5 percent as expectations are well-anchored owing to the strong inflation targeting
framework. The current account deficit is projected to remain elevated at 4.8 percent of GDP in
2014, but will decline gradually over the medium-term on account of expected pickup in mining
exports.
Macroeconomic policies have focused on being supportive of economic activity. The fiscal
surplus is estimated to have fallen to 0.5 percent in 2013, from 2.2 percent in 2012, in part due
to increased capital spending to support growth. The central bank has been unwinding reserve
requirement, in particular on local currency, since mid-2013 and cut the policy rate by 0.25
percent of a point to 4 percent on November 2013 citing slower domestic and global growth.
The exchange rate policy has been more flexible, but the central bank has intervened to limit
excessive volatility in the foreign exchange market.

Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2013 Article IV consultation with Peru, Executive Directors endorsed staff’s
appraisal, as follows:
The overall state of the economy remains strong despite lower metal prices and recent market
turbulence. Peru continues to be one of the most dynamic economies in the region, and one with
the largest buffers thanks to past strong policy implementation. With an economy growing
somewhat near potential, macroeconomic policies should remain relatively neutral, unless
additional turbulence in markets emerges or other downside risks materialize. Preserving policy
flexibility by continuing with a good track record of appropriate policy responses to adverse
circumstances remains instrumental to addressing future challenges. Risks are balanced. While
external risks are tilted to the downside, domestic risks are on the upside. Significant terms of
trade gains could be reversed if growth deteriorates in main trading partners, reducing income,
investment, and growth. Sudden stops and reversal of some non-Foreign Direct Investment
(FDI) capital flows to Peru (due to tightening of global financial conditions) could put pressure
on the financial system and further decelerate growth. While these risks are significant they
should be contained given a strong policy track-record, ample fiscal space, and large Foreign
Exchange (FX) reserves. Aggressive implementation of structural reforms and infrastructure
projects should help offset these risks. On the domestic side, large mining and infrastructure
projects could be implemented at a faster pace thereby increasing growth.
The fiscal objectives in the 2014 budget are broadly appropriate to maintain macroeconomic
stability. Staff estimates that instead of a planned balance, the outcome will most likely be a
small surplus (given past rates of expenditure implementation), which is counter-cyclical (given
an emerging negative output gap) and broadly appropriate given the soft economic conditions at
present. Staff welcomes the approval of the new fiscal responsibility law and the new fiscal
framework. Over the medium term, staff recommended to aim for small structural surpluses (of
around ½ percent of GDP a year) to address contingent liabilities and natural disasters risks,
which are high in Peru. When integrating the new fiscal framework into the budget process, it
would be important to take into account fiscal risks associated with contingent liabilities and
natural disasters, as well as the need to close the infrastructure and social gaps over time. A

strong political commitment as well as the steady implementation of a fiscal rule is equally
important.
With inflation expectation in check, a neutral monetary policy in the near term would be
appropriate, but continued flexibility need to be exercised as global interest rates rise. The recent
uptick in headline inflation was caused by temporary supply factors, while inflation expectations
remain well-anchored. Staff stressed the need for the Banco Central de Reserva del Peru
(BCRP) to focus on maintaining core inflation in check. The BCRP will also need to exercise
caution in managing monetary policy in the context of a likely increase in long-term global
interest rates.
Greater exchange rate flexibility observed over the past year is welcome as the exchange rate
continued to be used as a shock absorber. The exchange rate ought to continue to be driven by
fundamentals over the medium and long term, while limited foreign exchange intervention could
be necessary to reduce volatility and to contain excessive risks to the balance sheets in a still
highly dollarized economy. Given external risks, intervention is more likely to be on the sale
side. Such intervention will need to be properly sterilized to prevent a credit crunch and
unnecessary upward pressure in the interbank rate. Increasing exchange rate flexibility will
create further incentives for the deepening of the forwards (and other derivatives) market as the
private sector internalizes exchange rate risks, which in turn could stimulate the de-dollarization
of the economy.
Macro-prudential policies should continue to be well targeted to reduce vulnerabilities. In
addition to recent macro-prudential measures to deter the growth of dollar mortgage and car
loans, there is a need for measures to discourage un-hedged foreign exchange exposures of
households and corporates. The high spread between reserve requirements on dollar deposits
and that on local currency deposits needs to be maintained to discourage dollarization. While the
overall financial system remains healthy and strong, the recent deterioration of financial
soundness indicators for some non-bank deposit-taking institutions warrants closer monitoring
and supervision.

While vulnerabilities have increased, current buffers are sufficient to address possible short-term
shocks. Increased risk aversion due to the expected “tapering” of asset purchases by the USFR
could lead to a reversal of capital inflows, necessitating the central bank to deploy resolute
actions to maintain confidence and ensure orderly functioning of markets as was done during the
global financial crisis in 2008–09. Slower global growth could lead to lower external demand
and deterioration in terms of trade, the exchange rate should work as a shock absorber, although
there are risks given the dollarization of the financial system. Monetary and macro-prudential
policies should be relaxed to support economic activity. If the economic slowdown is too
pronounced, consideration could be given to use a measured and temporary fiscal impulse.
Resolute efforts are necessary to achieve ambitious tax targets. Staff welcomes the good
progress made in doubling capacity, coverage, and control process, which is evident by the good
performance of income and sales taxes. To bring Peru’s tax collections at par with other
emerging market economies, decisive steps will continue to be necessary in persevering with
reform efforts and in reducing a high level of informality, tax evasion, and exemptions.
Recent efforts to increase the country’s growth potential and ensure inclusive growth are
welcomed. Progress has been made in enhancing competitiveness by reducing barriers to
investment and increasing effectiveness of the public and private sectors, further developing the
local capital markets, and reforming of the private pension system to generate greater public
access and savings. Social agenda was pursued through broadening the existing projects and
advancing new social programs to ensure inclusive growth. Further progress in warranted to
boost productivity through increasing labor market flexibility, reducing non-salary costs,
upgrading human capital, removing infrastructure bottlenecks, and strengthening institutions.
Prioritization of structural reforms, including through designing a holistic nationwide
infrastructure strategy, will be key to preserving strong growth momentum.
