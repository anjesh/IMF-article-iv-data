December 3, 2010
Extended Arrangement. A three-year arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) for
225 percent of quota (SDR 19.8 million) was approved by the Executive Board on December 18,
2009 (effective December 23, 2009), replacing a Stand-By Arrangement approved in 2008. An
amount equivalent of SDR 7.48 million (85 percent of quota) has been disbursed, and equivalent
of SDR 1.76 million (20 percent of quota) is available upon completion of the second review.
Policy discussions. Staff met with President James Michel, Minister of Finance Danny Faure,
Governor Pierre Laporte of the Central Bank of Seychelles (CBS), other senior government
officials, and representatives of parliament, the private sector, civil society, and the diplomatic
community. The mission comprised Messrs. Le Dem (head), Messrs. Gigineishvili and Koehler
(AFR), Ms. Mwase (SPR), and Mr. Bartholomew (MCM). Mr. Roger Nord (AFR Senior Adviser)
participated in several discussions.
The program is on track. All quantitative performance criteria as of end-September 2010 have
been met and the program of structural reforms is broadly on track. In the attached letter of intent
and memorandum of economic and financial policies (MEFP), the authorities lay out an updated
set of program objectives for the rest of 2010 and 2011.
Past advice. The 2008 Article IV consultation was concluded on November 14, 2008. Directors
welcomed the authorities‘ determination to undertake far-reaching economic reforms aimed at
putting the economy back on the track of sustainable economic growth and development,
including the upfront liberalization of the exchange regime and float of the rupee, significant
fiscal and monetary tightening, and the launching of a comprehensive structural reform program.
Data. Seychelles has joined the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS); data provision is
broadly adequate for surveillance. The authorities intend to address weaknesses in the area of
national accounts and balance of payments (MEFP, ¶53) and to adhere to the Special Data
Dissemination System (SDDS) by mid-2012.
Exchange rate arrangements. Seychelles has a floating exchange rate and has accepted
Article VIII obligations. Seychelles maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on
the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
Next steps. The third review under the EFF-supported program is proposed for May 2011, based
on end-2010 test dates. Staff is proposing that the next Article IV consultation be held in
accordance with the Fund provisions on consultation cycles applicable to countries under a Fundsupported program.

I. STAFF APPRAISAL AND SUMMARY
1.
Two years of stabilization efforts and international assistance have moved
Seychelles away from the 2008 balance of payments and debt crises that threatened the
country’s high living standards. This was achieved through a remarkable turnaround of
economic policies, including foreign exchange market liberalization and floating of the rupee,
exceptional fiscal adjustment, and enhanced management of public finances and central bank.
The stabilization achievements were all the more remarkable since Seychelles had to confront at
the same time a global crisis that lowered tourism receipts, but fortunately spared its financial
system.
2.
International assistance contributed significantly to the country’s adjustment
efforts. The authorities‘ program under a Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) and successor Extended
Arrangement was supported by the restructuring of most of Seychelles‘ external debt on
favorable terms and fresh financing from official creditors. Renewed confidence of private
investors translated into increased foreign direct investment to develop the islands‘ exceptional
tourism potential.
3.
Developments in 2010 indicate that the economy is rapidly recovering on the back of
a rebound in tourism, creating some policy margins and trade-offs. Growth is expected to
reach at least 6 percent. Fiscal adjustment is projected to exceed the original budget targets by at
least 2 percentage points of GDP. These factors, together with the stabilization of the exchange
rate, the return to price stability, and the rebuilding of reserves offer room for more expansionary
policies.
4.
The medium-term outlook is favorable, but high risks require caution. Growth is
projected to gradually reach 5 percent over 2011-13. However, the timid global recovery and the
large external vulnerabilities (including the threat of piracy) plead in favor of rebuilding policy
buffers. The right balance needs to be struck between adopting a less restrictive fiscal policy
stance (including for rebuilding the long-neglected infrastructure crucial for fostering the
country‘s growth potential) and following a more ambitious path toward debt sustainability.
5.
Seychelles has returned to external stability but needs to address monetary policy
trade-offs and financial sector challenges. The exchange rate is broadly in line with
fundamentals. However, vigilance is needed against the inflationary and exchange rate risks
stemming from the large banking excess liquidity that is emerging from the quick reduction of
domestic public debt and slow recovery of private sector credit. The authorities agreed on the
need to issue treasury bills for monetary operation purposes, and to lengthen maturities. The
banking sector appears healthy but efforts need to be directed toward developing financial
intermediation through enhanced competition and reduced state intervention, better disclosure
requirements and consumer protection. These challenges are being addressed in the EFFsupported program.

4
6.
The program is on track. All performance criteria through end-September 2010 were
met and the year-end targets are within reach (Table 6). Although the structural reform agenda is
progressing broadly as scheduled, capacity bottlenecks have delayed two structural benchmarks
for end-September and end-November 2010 respectively. A new customs management act is
expected to be submitted to the National Assembly in early December, 2010, but more extensive
preparatory work is needed for the introduction of a new chart of accounts (Table 7).
7.
The program targets for 2011 reflect further efforts to consolidate a sound recovery
and secure Seychelles’s medium-term growth objective. A primary balance of 5 percent of
GDP accommodates a reasonable easing of the fiscal stance while maintaining the original path
toward debt sustainability. This easing, made possible by the substantial fiscal overperformance
of 2010, will facilitate priority recruitment and an increase in infrastructure projects. Further
steps will be taken to rationalize the tax system, including preparations for the launch of a valueadded tax (VAT) in mid-2012. Monetary policy will aim at maintaining inflation below
3 percent.
8.
The structural reform agenda aims at enhancing public financial and central bank
management, strengthening competition and risk management and reducing the role of the
state in the financial system. It addresses the financial risks posed by key state-owned
companies (Public Utility Company and Air Seychelles) to the still fragile public accounts and
initiates a reform of the social security system. The authorities have made excellent use of
technical assistance and staff welcomes their further requests to the Fund and other international
partners to help the country implement its ambitious structural reform program, notably in the
tax area.
9.
Risks to the program are adequately contained. Faced with the continued threat of
piracy that may disrupt its tourism and fishing sectors, Seychelles has taken an active role in the
international counter-piracy efforts. Despite the electoral context (presidential elections are
scheduled for the first half of 2011), the authorities have excluded delays in economic
adjustment and reforms. Staff is of the view that the strong track record of policy implementation
under the SBA and this successor Extended Arrangement makes this stance credible.
10.
In view of the continued strong performance through end-November 2010,
compliance with performance criteria, and consistency with the Fund’s Lending Into
Arrears Policy, staff recommends completion of the second Extended Arrangement
program and of financing assurances reviews. Staff supports moving to a new program review
and disbursement schedule with the new test dates being end-December and end-June.

II. TWO YEARS OF ECONOMIC STABILIZATION AND REFORMS
A. Rapid Stabilization Following a Severe Crisis
11.
Seychelles experienced an acute balance of payments and debt crisis in 2008. The
build-up of the imbalances over several years led to the erosion of the fiscal position and
increased reliance on external borrowing to cover spending needs. By 2007, the overall fiscal
deficit had reached 9.8 percent of GDP. Total public debt stood at 146 percent of GDP and was
projected to increase by another 20 percent of GDP in the following two years. By this stage,
gross official reserves were dramatically depleted: US$9.8 million only covered 0.1 months of
imports. External arrears had accumulated to US$160 million and were projected to double by
the following year, leading to the Standard and Poor‘s downgrade to ‗selective default‘ once
payments on private foreign debt were missed.
12.
The debt crisis culminated in a currency crisis. Several step adjustments in the value
of the rupee against the US dollar and a series of exchange restrictions and credit rationing had
not stemmed the balance of payment crisis, compounded by the 2008 commodity price shock.
The parallel market premium over the official pegged rate reached 55 percent.

13.
The policy turnaround launched in
November 2008 has been highly successful in
stabilizing the exchange rate. The authorities
removed all exchange restrictions and floated the
currency. They liberalized interest rates,
introduced a modern monetary framework
focused on liquidity management with marketbased instruments, and increased reserve
requirements. Since the floating of the currency in
November 2008, the exchange rate overshot,
registering a 50 percent depreciation and
significant volatility through the first quarter of
2009. Inflation peaked at 63 percent in December
2008, but the pass-through from the subsequent
two quarters of currency appreciation triggered a
rapid reversal that led to negative inflation from
end-2009, facilitating a decline in short-term
money market interest rates.

A strong and continued fiscal
adjustment has restored the prospect of
sustained medium-term growth and debt
sustainability. The heavily frontloaded fiscal
tightening (an improvement of more than 10
percentage points of GDP in the primary fiscal

6
balance in 2009) was achieved through deep cuts in public sector employment, stability in
nominal wages, and the removal of all indirect product subsidies. Reduction in public sector
employment has been absorbed by the private sector, though at lower real wages. A targeted,
modernized social safety net increased the efficiency of transfer expenditure and mitigated the
social impact of the reforms.

Tax reforms and improvements in revenue administration and expenditure
management helped sustain the credibility of the fiscal adjustment. Several tax exemptions
that had long compensated foreign investors for the overvalued currency were removed. The
Ministry of Finance (MOF) has built capacity internally to strengthen budget processes. Key
achievements include the conduct of mid-year formal expenditure reviews, the adoption of new
procurement and transparent tendering processes and the establishment of a macroeconomic and
revenue forecasting unit at the MOF.
16.
Under strong stabilization policies and a simultaneous deterioration of the global
environment, Seychelles experienced limited output decline and rapid strengthening of its
external position. The drop in real GDP was

7
recent improvements, Seychelles exports remain undiversified, even compared to other countries
in the region and small island economies.
17.
The turnaround in economic policies facilitated exceptional debt restructuring. First,
Paris Club creditors provided a substantial debt write-off (45 percent in nominal terms) for a
middle-income country. Second, despite a fragmented private creditor base and the bankruptcy
of Lehman Brothers, the single largest commercial creditor, Seychelles‘ proposed debt exchange
(with a 50 percent haircut) was successful (Appendix II).
B. A Strengthening Recovery in 2010
18.
The widespread rebound in economic activity is driving growth above pre-crisis
levels. In recent months, activity has picked up in tourism (on a year-to-date basis, tourist
arrivals were 10.8 percent higher in September 2010), and in construction and
telecommunications, mainly reflecting an exceptionally large increase in FDI.1 Real GDP growth
is projected to exceed 6 percent in 2010. The large increase in FDI-related imports is projected to
substantially widen the external current account deficit in 2010.
19.
The exchange rate appears to have stabilized at a sustainable level. In real effective
terms, the exchange rate depreciation has corrected the overvaluation assessed in 2008, before
the float of the currency (Appendix I). The rupee depreciated by about 11 percent against the
U.S. dollar in first nine months of the year, partly driven by the weakening euro, but appears to
have stabilized since then. Reflecting the exchange rate pass-through, inflation has picked up
slightly, returning to positive territory in September.
20.
Given the benign inflation
outlook and the return of confidence in
the rupee, the monetary policy stance
has been accommodative during most
of the year. Through September broad
money increased by 26 percent on yearon-year basis, driven largely by
accumulation of foreign assets by banks.
Private credit, however, increased by
only 8 percent.2 As a result, the loan-todeposit ratio remained at about 45
percent, which is well below regional and

other comparator group averages. Ample liquidity in commercial banks pushed interest rates on
3-month government securities to 1.5 percent in September from about 10 percent a year ago.
21.
Buoyant government revenues created fiscal space for extra discretionary spending
while accelerating debt reduction. Revenues are now expected to exceed original budget
projections by more than 4 percentage points of GDP, reflecting mainly stronger-than-expected
tax collections on turnover and imports.3 In October, the authorities passed a supplementary
budget covering additional current (0.7 percent of GDP, mainly goods and services) and capital
expenditures (1 percent of GDP) for infrastructure projects, education, and health in the last
quarter.4 The personal income tax rate was also reduced from 18.75 percent to 15 percent,
effective October 1, three months ahead of schedule.
22.
The debt restructuring is close to completion. Bilateral debt agreements were signed
with most Paris Club creditors, several non-Paris Club creditors and all commercial banks. The
authorities have continued good faith negotiations with a few remaining non-Paris Club bilateral
and private creditors, in line with the Fund‘s Lending Into Arrears Policy. In recent months,
most creditors agreed to grant Seychelles a treatment comparable with that of the Paris Club
agreement, and all. Reflecting mostly the second-tranche of the Paris Club debt stock reduction
in July and the restructuring of debt with commercial banks—all have been signed—external
debt is expected to decline to
45 percent of GDP at year-end.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
23.
The 2010 Article IV discussions focused on the medium-term outlook and the challenges
that confront Seychelles, including recovering from a severe external debt crisis, reducing the
small island state‘s vulnerability to external shocks, and promoting private-sector led growth.
Several interrelated issues were discussed: the use of the fiscal margins that have emerged from
the economic recovery, external stability issues, monetary policy trade-offs and the management
of commercial banks‘ growing liquidity, and the development of a sound financial sector.
A. Outlook and Risks
24.
The outlook is favorable. The projected reduction of FDI inflows is expected to slow
down growth temporarily to 4.3 percent in 2011. Medium-term growth could reach 5 percent.
The tourism industry is actively promoting Seychelles outside its traditional markets and
expanding the stock of accommodations. These factors place the country in a good position to

effects of a large construction project and unforeseen dividends from the partly state-owned tuna cannery as a result
of the renegotiated shareholders‘ agreement.
4

Capital outlays were included in the supplementary budget law for information because they do not require
parliamentary approval under the existing Public Finance Bill. The authorities intend to amend the bill such that
parliamentary oversight will cover all budget expenditures (MEFP, ¶23).

9
benefit from the expected recovery and medium-term growth in tourism activity.5 Increased
fiscal margins will also help sustain domestic demand and address the infrastructure bottleneck.
Inflation is expected to remain low. The current account will narrow to 24 percent of GDP in
2011, declining gradually over the medium term to 10 percent of GDP by 2015 on account of
lower FDI-related imports and growth in tourism and tuna exports.
25.
Significant risks continue to stem from the volatility of the external environment. In
particular, the continued threat of piracy may disrupt tourism activity, and push up insurance
premiums and shipping costs on external trade.
Authorities’ views
26.
The authorities concur with the staff’s views that a medium-term growth of 4 to
5 percent is within reach. To achieve this goal, they give priority to the pursuit of sound
macroeconomic policies, the promotion of a private sector-led growth, and the removal of
infrastructure bottlenecks in energy and water supply, sewage, roads and telecommunications.
27.
To address the large vulnerability that can affect a small island economy like
Seychelles, the authorities are actively working on diversifying exports. They see tourism as
the main engine of growth in the medium term, but actively promote Seychelles as a destination
outside its predominant European market, most notably in Asia. To address the threats of piracy,
they have taken the lead in the coordination of international counter-piracy efforts in this region
of the Indian Ocean. They count on the recent change of ownership of the tuna canning factory to
develop exports and draw additional benefits for the country. They see the offshore financial
sector as a marginal activity (Appendix V), but are actively pursuing offshore oil exploration in
Seychelles‘ large and promising exclusive economic zone.
B. Fiscal Policy Margins
28.
Seychelles’s stabilization success
offers perspectives for a less painful path
toward fiscal sustainability but caution is
needed to maintain external stability and
growth prospects. The stronger-thananticipated fiscal adjustment in 2009-10,
coupled with higher growth and a slightly
more favorable outturn of debt rescheduling
provides space for a combination of a less
restrictive fiscal policy stance and a more rapid
path toward public debt reduction. In
discussing the appropriate balance between the

two, staff argued that rebuilding faster economic policy buffers would help mitigate the external
shocks that the country will continue to be exposed to. It emphasized the need for the fiscal
policy to take into account Seychelles‘s still fragile external position. Staff also thought part of
the fiscal room should be used to rebuild the public infrastructure neglected in the last decade,
compared to small island developing states, thereby removing growth bottlenecks.
Authorities’ views
29.
The authorities plan to maintain the programmed medium-term reduction in
primary surpluses consistent with bringing the public debt-to-GDP ratio below 50 percent
by 2018. While the return to fiscal sustainability was an essential element of their medium-term
strategy, they argued that it was also time to start distributing the dividends of the successful
adjustment to the Seychellois and begin reversing the decline in real government wages in recent
years. They also noted that the recourse to external project finance would alleviate short-term
pressures on the balance of payments, to the extent that it remains consistent with external
stability. As a result, most of the envisaged debt reduction will stem from a rapid repayment in
domestic liabilities. This entails other complications in terms of liquidity management, as
discussed below.
C. External Stability
30.
The updated exchange rate assessment indicates that it is in line with fundamentals
(Appendix I). At the 2008 Article IV Consultation, the exchange rate was estimated to be
overvalued by 11 to 33 percent. The floating of the rupee has led to a 16 percent depreciation in
real effective terms. This adjustment has contributed to improved competitiveness in tourism
while facilitating strong adjustment in non FDI-related imports in 2009. As of end-September
2010, the exchange rate does not appear overvalued in the three Fund standard approaches if
adjustment is made for the large FDI-related imports and other exceptional factors that are
expected to temporarily bring the external current account deficit to record levels in 2010.
31.
The authorities noted the significant uncertainties surrounding the exchange rate
assessment and that the recently introduced currency regime has so far served the country
well. They keep an open mind about the suitability of exchange rate regime changes provided
economic fundamentals and circumstances justify them at the time.
D. Monetary Policy and Liquidity Overhang
32.
The key challenge facing the central bank is to preserve price and market stability
in light of the persistent liquidity overhang. Fiscal overperformance in 2009-2010 allowed the
government to retire a large amount of domestic debt, leaving banks with (unremunerated)
excess reserves of about 4 percent of GDP. If left unaddressed, the liquidity overhang may
unwind in a disorderly depreciation and a resurgence of high inflation. The concerns are
threefold. First, with the resumption of growth and the recovery in domestic demand, the
inflationary environment is likely to become less benign in 2011, with additional pressure

11
stemming from the liquidity overhang. Second, the situation may quickly turn around in response
to adverse external or domestic shocks to which Seychelles remains highly susceptible. Third,
given low money market rates, the search for returns may result in capital outflows.
33.
The discussions focused on how to
improve the monetary policy transmission
mechanism. Staff‘s cross-country analysis
(Appendix III) confirms that compared to
peers, interest rate pass-through is weak in
Seychelles. A persistent liquidity overhang
and inadequate competition among banks
appear to be the main factors behind the
sluggishness of monetary transmission, which
undermines the central bank‘s ability to react
to inflation.

34.
To mitigate these risks, the staff
proposed a tighter monetary stance in 2011 than in 2010, and advised mopping up excess
reserves. Given the magnitude of liquidity to be absorbed and the high sterilization costs this
implies for the central bank, the authorities should consider issuing of treasury bills for monetary
policy purposes.6 This would provide the CBS with additional tradable securities for open market
operations at an estimated annual fiscal cost of 0.1 percent of GDP in additional interest
payments. The alternative to the CBS issuing its own paper was considered a less preferable
option because it would further fragment an already shallow money market and weaken the
CBS‘s balance sheet. In parallel, to help develop the yield curve and minimize the rollover risk,
the government could gradually lengthen the maturity of domestic debt by issuing 2- to 3-year
bonds.
35.
Additional options to address the liquidity overhang were discussed. Raising
minimum reserve requirements would absorb part of the structural excess liquidity and provide
some additional room for non-inflationary reserve money growth. Moving the large deposits
(about three quarters of banks‘ excess reserves) of the Social Security Fund from commercial
banks to the central bank would also help.
Authorities’ views
36.
The authorities shared the mission’s assessment of risks and agreed with the
proposed issuance of T-bills for monetary purposes (MEFP ¶ 30). They saw the liquidity
overhang, however, as a temporary phenomenon that would partially be reabsorbed with the
expected credit growth and reduction in lending rates to the private sector. They felt committed

the budget.

12
to tightening the monetary policy stance if required, but felt that raising reserve requirements
after having lowered them in 2009 would undermine monetary policy credibility. A gradual
reduction in liquidity has been built into the monetary program for 2011.
E. Financial Sector Development
37.
Banks are in good financial health and adequately capitalized (Table 5). Compared
to end-2009, credit quality deteriorated significantly in 2010 (the percentage of nonperforming
loans increased), in large part owing to reclassification of pre-crisis loans from ―watch‖ to
nonperforming. Aggregate provisioning as measured against classified assets remained
unchanged. Bank earnings were strong and net interest margins high, but declining from 2009 on
account of lower interest rates on government securities.

The stress tests conducted by the mission indicate that banks are most vulnerable to
credit risks stemming from increased default rates by borrowers in response to extreme
interest rate shocks (Appendix IV). The likelihood of such events, however, is limited,
implying that banks remain well positioned to withstand fairly severe shocks.

The discussion focused on how to promote financial sector development and
competition among banks. High returns on assets and equity, including relative to banks in the
35
region cannot be fully explained by the high risk
T-bill Rates and Lending Rates (Percent)
premium that several foreign-owned commercial
30
banks require on their operations in Seychelles.
25
Together with the disconnect between money market
Tbill rate
20
and retail lending rates, this suggests a lack of
Lending rate
15
competition in the banking sector. Lending rates
have been slow to react, and interest margins
10
widened in spite of liquidity pressures and sharp
5

drop in short term T-bill rates since the start of the

stabilization program. Private sector credit at 25
percent of GDP remains low compared to peers and is
growing slowly despite banks‘ ample liquidity.

40.
Staff made several recommendations to address the issue of insufficient competition
among banks and promote financial sector development. These include removing the
obstacles to competition stemming from information asymmetry (enhancing public disclosure of
banking products and financial literacy) and high loan prepayment and refinancing fees. Efforts
should also be directed toward establishing credit rating systems and eliminating legal barriers
related to pledging and foreclosing collateral. Moreover, staff invited the authorities to reflect on
the excessive role that state-owned financial institutions play in the economy to the detriment of
development of the financial sector. This is particularly the case in the mortgage lending sector,
which is dominated by the subsidized loans of the state-owned Housing Finance Corporation
(HFC).
41.
The risk posed by the offshore financial sector to financial stability is limited but
should continue to be closely monitored to comply with international standards on antimoney laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). The offshore
sector had featured prominently in the authorities‘ long-term strategy published in 2007,
particularly as a means of diversifying economic activity and reducing the reliance on tourism as
a driver of growth. However, offshore banking remains limited, and offshore financial activity is
currently concentrated in the registration of international business companies (IBCs), which
increases potential exposure to illicit activities (Appendix V).
Authorities’ views
42.
The authorities intend to promote bank competition and develop credit markets and
mortgage lending through improved transparency and information dissemination. They
plan to improve disclosure practices and strengthen legal protection of borrowers and lenders
through legislative and/or regulatory changes (MEFP ¶45). In collaboration with Seychelles
Bankers‘ Association and the Fair Trading Commission, they plan to launch a public awareness
campaign. They consider sound competition among banks a precondition for implementation of

14
their long-term goal of state-owned bank privatization. As part of their financial sector reform
agenda, the authorities are developing a housing finance policy to be submitted to the cabinet by
June 2011. Among other obstacles to mortgage lending (including legal issues related to
collateral) the policy will aim at reducing the role of the state in this area, starting with possible
divestiture of HFC (MEFP ¶27). The authorities have also taken steps to tighten the AML/CFT
framework and improve the transparency of the offshore financial sector (MEFP ¶40).
IV. PROGRAM REVIEW
A. Performance Under the Extended Arrangement
43.
The program is on track: all quantitative performance criteria were met with
margins although capacity constraints delayed two structural benchmarks. All endSeptember 2010 quantitative performance criteria were met (Table 6). As regards structural
benchmarks, budget submission protocols and procedures were introduced by end-July 2010 as
planned but the new Customs Management Act was submitted to the National Assembly with
two months‘ delay (Table 7). A plan of action will be submitted to Cabinet by end-April 2011
with the aim of introducing the new Chart of Accounts in the 2012 Budget. The rest of the
structural reform agenda remains on track. Preliminary evidence indicates that all quantitative
performance criteria for end-December 2010 are within reach.
B. Program for 2011
44.
The program accommodates an easing of the fiscal stance consistent with progress
toward debt sustainability and external stability. After two years of fiscal overperformance,
the authorities target a primary surplus of 5 percent of GDP for the 2011 budget, 1 percentage
point of GDP less than initially planned. Excluding the one-off net repayments of 3.4 percent of
GDP to the government in 2010,7 the primary balance will decline from 6 percent of GDP to
5 percent in 2011. This will provide fiscal space to finance infrastructure to address the main
growth bottleneck in the medium term while keeping public debt on a declining path.
45.
The government is implementing comprehensive tax reforms aimed at further
rationalizing the tax system and harmonizing rates across sectors. The 10 percent personal
income tax (PIT) for expatriates introduced in July 2010 will be aligned with the domestic
residents‘ rate of 15 percent in January 2011. Preferential goods and services tax (GST) rates for
tourism are being phased out and preparatory work is underway for replacing GST with a VAT
in 2012. This entails further tax administration reforms, including at the newly established Large
Taxpayer Unit (LTU) of the Seychelles Revenue Commission (SRC) and increased coordination
with the Customs Department.

7

The national oil company fully reimbursed its government loan in 2010, and no net lending operations are
budgeted in 2011.

15
46.
With one-off positive factors disappearing in 2011, government revenue is projected
to decline in terms of GDP; but grants are on the rise. The net budgetary impact of policy
changes to PIT and GST is positive and estimated at 0.4 percent of GDP. However, abstracting
from this and the extensive presentational changes in the 2011 Budget, revenue is projected to
decline by 1.5 percent of GDP. This is mainly due to the normalization of business tax receipts
after exceptionally high corporate profits recorded in 2010 (MEFP ¶11). In addition, dividends
from state-owned banks and the tuna cannery (following the renegotiation of the shareholder
agreement) are projected at half their 2010 amounts, although they are partly compensated by
projected dividends from the national oil company. Grants are projected to increase from 1.5 to
4 percent of GDP as the disbursements delayed in 2010 (e.g., in-kind benefits for the coastguard
facility) are carried forward to the following year.
47.
Wage reforms and priority recruitment are expected to increase primary current
expenditures. The overall wage increase of 1.5 percentage points of GDP reflects the inclusion
in the 2011 budget of the pension and social security contributions of the government as an
employer (MEFP, page 53). It also reflects ongoing policy measures to modernize the civil
servant wage grid and strengthen resources devoted to important administrative functions,
including the Seychelles Revenue Commission. The consolidation of budget-dependent entities
in the 2011 budget also explains part of the 1.6 percent of GDP increase in goods, services and
transfers. In net terms, the entities that benefit from expanded budgetary lines in 2011 include the
Seychelles Tourism Board, the National Sports Council and the Land Transport Agency.
48.
Capital expenditure will continue to be directed toward improving public
infrastructure. The focus of the 2011 budget is on enhancing the output capacity of the Public
Utility Company, rehabilitating the main hospital in Victoria and upgrading educational
facilities. A contingency line of about 0.5 percent of GDP has been established in the capital
budget to protect the primary balance target against low revenue performance in the first half of
2011 (MEFP, ¶14).
49.
The monetary policy stance will aim at maintaining inflation below 3 percent. The
CBS will retain reserve money targeting under a flexible exchange rate regime as its operational
framework, which has been successful in taming inflation in the aftermath of the crisis. To
achieve its objective of low single-digit inflation, the CBS will rely mainly on market based
policy instruments and will continue to build its analytical and operational capacity.
50.
Enhancing public financial management (PFM) is a key area of structural reforms
(MEFP ¶18-23). To assess the progress made in public financial management, with the
assistance of the European Union, the authorities will undertake a new assessment under the
Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) standards in early 2011. A new chart of
accounts will be introduced for the 2012 budget to support improved decision making on the
allocation of resources. The amendments to the Public Finance Act will reflect recent operational
improvements in PFM, introducing principles of transparency, accountability, medium-term
stability and budget performance and extending its coverage to budget formulation and budget

16
execution processes; the act will also extend the National Assembly‘s oversight of the budget to
capital expenditures.
51.
Other structural measures intend to achieve greater efficiency and accountability of
public enterprises and initiate a reform of the social security system. The immediate
objectives are to improve governance and financial management for two strategic enterprises,
Air Seychelles and the PUC (MEFP, ¶25). A strategic assessment report on the national airline,
prepared by international aviation consultants, has recently been submitted to cabinet, which will
decide on further reform steps to adopt a long-term strategy for Air Seychelles. PUC will
reinstate the indexation of electricity tariffs to fuel costs and plans to hire a consultant to conduct
a tariff study in the first half of 2011. The objective is to provide recommendations on the
optimal structure and levels of tariffs by end-2011, which will be consistent with full cost
recovery and meeting future investment needs. Based on the recommendations of the World
Bank, the government is currently developing a policy that will outline the investment objectives
of the social security fund‘s assets by September 2011 (MEFP, ¶24).

52.
The program for the remainder of 2010 and for 2011 is financed. The authorities plan
to complete the restructuring of Seychelles‘ external debt through the signature of bilateral
agreements with a few remaining creditors (MEFP ¶47-49). The minor financing residual gaps
for 2010 and 2011 are expected to be closed by these restructurings.
C. Program Modalities
53.
Staff proposes a simplified program monitoring framework. At present, the program
is based on semi-annual reviews, with quarterly quantitative performance criteria (PCs),
financing assurances reviews, and disbursements. Given the good track record of program
implementation under the previous SBA and the current EFF, and an almost-completed
rescheduling of external debt, staff proposes that program monitoring be carried out on
semiannual basis, including financing assurances reviews, PCs, and disbursements (Table 9).
Test dates for the semiannual reviews are set for end-December and end-June for a better
synchronization with the budget cycle.
54.
The debt limits have been revised upward to accommodate expected financing in
support of large infrastructural needs. In particular, in 2011 PUC plans to contract loans for
electricity and water projects with a government guarantee, both from multilateral sources at
concessional rates. In addition, the government will provide a US$8 million guarantee to support
a strategic private-public partnership for a submarine cable project that will supply high speed
internet connections. Reflecting these developments, public external debt is expected to rise to
49.2 percent of GDP in 2011 but to decline over the medium term as the growth effects of the
financing filter through to reach 34.2 percent of GDP in 2015. Although the profile of Seychelles
debt is sustainable, it remains vulnerable to shocks, particularly those from export-related shocks
(See Appendix II).
55.
The next Article IV consultation with Seychelles will take place within 24 months subject
to the provisions of the decision on consultation cycles in program countries.

Appendix I. Real Exchange Rate Assessment8
Following a severe balance of payment crisis and a depletion of the official reserves,
Seychelles fully liberalized its foreign exchange market and moved from a fixed exchange
rate to a floating exchange rate in November 2008.
Before the float, the parallel exchange rate flourished with a premium of more than 50 percent.
At the 2008 Article IV consultation, indicators pointed to an overvaluation of the real effective
exchange rate of 11 to 33 percent. The
large external imbalances were related to 225 Tourist arrivals

Tourism shares also held up well during the crisis.
Staff estimates suggest that as of end-September 2010 the real exchange rate of the rupee was
broadly in line with both current and medium-term (2015) fundamentals, with sizable
differences across methodologies. The findings from three formal assessments, using the IMF‘s
Consultative Group on Exchange rate (CGER)-based methodologies, are presented below.
The macroeconomic balance approach estimates an equilibrium current account (‗norm‘)
based on economic fundamentals for Seychelles relative to its trading partners and an underlying
current account adjusted for large one-off FDI-related imports and debt service payments. In
2010, a significant depreciation would be required to close the gap between the underlying
current account and the norm. Based on balance of payments projections presented in this report,
this overvaluation almost disappears in 2015.

The external sustainability approach
calculates the current account that stabilizes
the net foreign assets (NFA)-to-GDP ratio.
As of 2010, Seychelles is estimated to have
net foreign liabilities of about 170 percent of
GDP, excluding the large amounts of
resident deposits in foreign banks which are
reported in BIS statistics (probably
reflecting instead offshore banking activity).
The stabilization of the NFA within a range
25 percent around the 2010 ratio would
require a modest range of depreciation, but
this overvaluation is projected to disappear
in 2015.

Appendix II. Debt Sustainability Analysis9

Overview of External Debt Restructuring

Faced with shortages of foreign exchange and a less benign external environment
Seychelles experienced a balance of payments and debt crisis in 2008. Large macroeconomic
imbalances from fiscal slippages combined with global commodity price shocks and the global
economic slowdown, culminated in mid-2008 with a near-exhaustion of foreign reserves and
missed payments on public debt obligations, and resulting in a surge in the current account
deficit to 49 percent from the 2003-07 average of 12 percent. Reflecting this, Seychelles
sovereign rating was reduced from B to junk grade in late 2008.
The external debt stock stood at about US$760 million, or about 83 percent of GDP at the
end of 2008, with about 42 percent in arrears. Commercial creditors accounted for about 62
percent of this debt—mostly reflecting acceleration of amortizing notes—and Paris Club debt
amounted to about 18 per-cent of total debt.
The authorities embarked on a comprehensive debt restructuring exercise but faced a
number of challenges:

A fragmented creditor base, particularly for the Eurobond, and bankruptcy of the single
largest commercial creditor (Lehman Brothers) complicated the process.


Paris Club precedent. The Paris Club creditors had only ever provided debt write-off for
middle-income countries with major geopolitical influence, for example Iraq.

The authorities have restructured about 91 percent of eligible debt.
Paris Club Agreement: On April 16, 2009, the Government of Seychelles reached an
exceptional agreement on approximately US$160 million in bilateral debt.10The agreement
provided for an overall nominal debt cancellation of 45 percent to be applied to stocks in two
tranches (July 2009 and July 2010). The remaining debt would be repaid over 18 years on the
basis of a graduating amortizing schedule that includes a five-year grace period. The agreement
extends the average life of the debt portfolio from 6 months to 13 years. The Paris Club‘s
treatment obliged Seychelles to seek comparable treatment from other bilateral and private
creditors.
Private sector debt: While engaging commercial banks in discussions, the government focused
on capital market debt, which could be restructured through a one-off exchange offer and posed a
greater risk of potential legal action. Under the exchange offer process, the government would
issue a new bond to replace eligible existing claims, but only if it received support from
75 percent of the creditors. In December 2009, the authorities received an unprecedented

The agreement includes South Africa which participated in and signed the umbrella agreement.

32
US$10 million guarantee from the African Development Bank, partially covering its interest
obligations under the bond exchange offer.
In February 2010, the government closed the bond exchange offer on US$320 million of private
sector debt with 100 percent participation, the first modern sovereign bond restructuring to have
no residual holdout creditor problem. The debt restructuring included a collective action clause
with a minimum threshold for participation. The amortizing notes and commercial loans were
tendered in their entirety, while 84 percent of the Eurobond debt was tendered, triggering the
collective action clause. Tenders for the optional par bonds fell below the minimum threshold
and the face value of the entire eligible debt (about US$283 million, not including arrears and
penalties) was exchanged for about US$169 million of discount bonds on February 11, 2010.
About 50 percent of the debt was canceled. This provided a high relief compared to other recent
sovereign external debt exchanges. The remaining debt will be repaid over 16 years with a stepup interest rate structure and six-year grace period on principal repayments.
Agreements have been reached in principle with all commercial banks on approximately
US$110 million of debt; new loan agreements have been signed with all domestic banks.
Commercial banks have agreed to extend repayment over prolonged periods with long grace
periods and low interest rates. Most of the commercial bank loans have been converted to local
currency loans to ease pressure on the country‘s foreign reserves.
Non-Paris Club official debt: Most creditors have agreed in principle to negotiate debt
restructuring on terms broadly comparable with the Paris Club agreement. Agreements have
been signed with Algeria, Libya and Malaysia. South Africa has signed the umbrella Paris Club
agreement but is yet to sign the bilateral agreement. Negotiations have advanced with the
remaining creditors (Abu Dhabi, China, India and Kuwait).
Reflecting these debt agreements, the debt service profile has extended and external public
debt is estimated at US$460 million (or about 49.2 percent of GDP) at end-November 2010.
About 53 percent of this debt is owed to commercial creditors, while the Paris Club countries
account for about 17 percent of the total. Seychelles has no arrears with multilateral creditors but
about US$33 million (or 7.2 percent of total debt) is in arrears with non-Paris Club official and
private creditors pending restructuring. In nominal terms, external debt service is projected to
peak in 2018 before leveling off for the next seven years. The peak remains manageable as a
share of GDP and forecast revenues.

II.

Debt Sustainability Analysis

The updated debt sustainability analysis indicates that as a result of the restructuring of
most external debt (including a substantial reduction in NPV terms) and strong fiscal adjustment
under the program, public debt appears to have a long-run downward path toward sustainability.
However, bound tests indicate that Seychelles remains vulnerable to shocks.

33
Macroeconomic assumptions
The debt sustainability analysis is based on the following medium-term macroeconomic
framework (details in the staff report). Output growth is projected to rise gradually stabilizing at
5 percent over the medium term supported by tourism. Inflation is expected to remain at around
3 percent over the medium term in line with major trading partners‘ inflation. The medium-term
current account outlook points to a sharp narrowing of the deficit driven largely by tourism and
tuna export earnings and lower FDI (hence FDI-related) imports. With the completion of several
large hotel and residential projects, net FDI flows are expected to gradually slow down to about
11 percent of GDP in 2015.
External debt
Baseline scenario
From 92.2 percent of GDP at end 2009, public external debt is projected to decline to
45.3 percent at end-2010, as a result of the debt restructuring (Tables 6a and Figure 1), and to
34.2 percent of GDP in 2015, reflecting mainly the restrictive although gradually loosening fiscal
stance. However, the debt profile will increase in 2011 reflecting the impact of expected
borrowing by a parastatal for priority infrastructure spending and a central government guarantee
for an important cable project.
Sensitivity analysis
The external debt dynamics is particularly sensitive to historically-based assumptions, reflecting
the major changes that Seychelles experienced over the last five years. A shock on the
noninterest current account is destabilizing, even when these shocks do not account for the
volatile but fully financed FDI-related imports, because the large pre and post-debt crisis
fluctuations in the current account. As a result, a one-half standard deviation shock to the noninterest current account applied each year during 2011-15 would increase external debt to 69 percent of GDP in 2015. A shock returning key macroeconomic variables (including real GDP,
nominal interest rates and non-interest current account) to historical averages would increase
external debt to 86 percent of GDP in 2015. To a large extent this shock implies the return to the
failed policies of the past, an unlikely move given the authorities‘ commitment to maintain
prudent fiscal and monetary policies.
Public debt
The total public debt-to-GDP ratio follows a similar declining profile, from 76.1 percent of GDP
in 2010 to 64.6 percent in 2012 and easing further to just under 50 percent of GDP by 2015. This
path suggests that a sustainability profile is achieved, although the standardized bound tests show
that Seychelles remains very vulnerable to a variety of shocks (Table II.3, and Figure II.2)
including interest rates, the primary balance and growth.
The higher sensitivity of public debt to interest rate shocks, compared to external debt, mainly
reflects the higher volatility and magnitude in recent years.

Appendix III. Determinants of Interest Rate Pass-Through11
Retail lending interest rates in Seychelles appear weakly connected to short-term money market
rates. From the start of the stabilization program in late 2008, short-term rates on government
securities declined considerably, but lending rates remained high, suggesting that this phase of
monetary transmission–market-to-retail interest rate pass-through–is weak and incomplete. Our
cross-country study finds empirical support of this observation. It also finds that undeveloped
financial markets, excess liquidity and lack of banking competition are the key factors
undermining monetary transmission.
International Comparisons of Interest Rate Pass-Through
Market-to-retail pass-through is formalized
using the cost of funds approach, which
applies the standard marginal cost pricing
model to financial markets. The underlying
idea is that money market rates reflect
marginal costs of funds because banks rely
on them for short-term borrowing needs. As
banks will be passing their interest costs to
customers, the theory implies a positive
relationship between market and retail
lending rates.

The results confirm the weakness of interest
rate pass-through in Seychelles compared to
that of peer groups.12 The long-run pass
through elasticity ( for Seychelles is lower
than the average of any subgroup, except
Middle Eastern countries, where passthrough is likely to be constrained by the
rules of Islamic banking. The chart reveals
that interest rate pass-through tends to be
weaker in less developed countries and
small island states.13

Empirical Methodology and Data
Interest rate pass-through is estimated using the
following ARDL specification:
, where iR and iM are logs of lending
and money market rates (90-day T-bill or interbank
rate) respectively. ‘s are short-term interaction
coefficients between retail and market rates. The longterm pass-through elasticity is calculated as
. The data sample includes
monthly interest rates from Dec. 2005 to March 2010
for 81 countries.

Determinants of Interest Rate Pass-Through
Banks may react differently to market rate changes for different reasons, including those related
to macroeconomic conditions and characteristics of the financial sector. To determine the
causality, the estimated individual country pass-through elasticities were regressed on country11

Part of the pass-through weakness in Seychelles could be due to the fact that the data sample covers the prereform period of exchange controls and financial sector repression. The re-estimation of the model for the post
reform period only (once sufficient time series become available), may yield more favorable results.

specific macroeconomic variables (per capita GDP, market volatility, inflation, etc.), financial
sector indicators (liquidity, asset quality, profitability, cost structure, etc.), and a set of dummy
variables to control for country size, geographic region and exchange regime.
The main findings can be summarized as follows:
 Island economies tend to have weaker pass-through.
 More-developed countries have stronger pass-through. Richer borrowers are likely to be less
sensitive to interest costs, which makes it easier for banks to pass these costs to them. GDP
growth and inflation do not have an impact, possibly because of their cyclical nature, even
though a priori one would expect positive relationships.
 Market volatility weakens the pass-through. Interest rate fluctuations increase uncertainty and
dampen banks‘ reaction to noisy market signals.
 Excess liquidity weakens pass-through. In overly liquid money markets all participants tend to
be on the sell side of the market; interbank borrowing dries up, and money market rates fail to
reflect true marginal cost of funds. As a consequence, retail lending rates become less elastic
to money market rates and the connection between the two weakens.
 High profitability of the banking sector, which is often a reflection of inadequate competition
and market power, weakens pass-through. This is not surprising since competition is likely to
force banks to adjust their pricing more quickly.

Policy implications for Seychelles
Being an island economy already puts Seychelles at a relative disadvantage, thereby increasing
importance of other measures to strengthen pass-through. Compared with peer groups, markets
in Seychelles are more volatile, and banks are considerably more liquid and profitable (high
returns on equity)–the factors that, according to the study, undermine monetary transmission and
therefore the effectiveness of monetary policy. To strengthen pass-through, Seychelles should
develop financial markets to reduce market volatility; reduce excess liquidity in the banking
system; and strengthen banking competition.

41
Appendix IV. Financial Sector Vulnerabilities and Stress-Testing Results14 15
Based on September 2010 data, the banking sector is adequately capitalized, liquid and
profitable. Although mismatched in asset/liability maturity, it appears to be reasonably resilient
to risks.
The major risk facing Seychelles banks is credit risk, but not abnormally. Banks are well
positioned for first round effects of interest rates changes, but appear more vulnerable to second
round effects due to higher default rates on loans. The exchange rate risk, which was the main
source of vulnerability prior to the float at the time of the 2008 Article IV Consultation, has been
mitigated by the net open position requirements introduced in early 2009.
Credit risk: As banks have the capacity to reprice domestic loans as fast as their liabilities, they
can maintain their net interest margins and largely be unaffected by first-round interest rates
effects. The real risk comes from second-round effects. To maintain interest margins, banks
would have to increase interest rates on customer loans, which in turn would result in higher
default rates.16 If all collateral in the system were valued at zero, industry capitalization would
have been 6.7 percent with two banks less than well capitalized.17 With the new standard of
classification and provisioning, adopted in November 2010, the first bank would fail if 22 percent of current loans became a loss and the industry would have unweighted Tier 1 capitalization
of 2.8 percent.
The industry seems reasonably resilient to other standard stress tests. Credit quality stress tests:
With a 40 percent increase in non-performing loans (NPL) and an extreme assumption that all
were a total loss, the industry capitalization would have declined to 4.8 percent. One bank would
have failed, and three banks would have been less than well capitalized. Alternatively, if
additional NPLs were provisioned, a 260 percent increase in provisioning would be needed to
cover bad loans, which would result in the first failure and industry capitalization of 5.5 percent.
Finally, it would take 22 percent of pass loans to be classified as a loss for the first bank to fail.
Liquidity stress tests: a 30 percent drop in deposits funded by a corresponding reduction in liquid
assets would reduce the industry liquidity ratio to 28.3 percent, and only one bank would exhaust
its liquidity and two banks would fall below 10 percent.18 Exchange rate stress tests: An
appreciation or depreciation of the rupee will not cause any bank failures. Depreciation from
SR/US$12.1 to SR/US$16 would improve Tier 1 capitalization from 7.3 percent to 7.8 percent,
while an appreciation to SR/US$8 would deteriorate it to 6.5 percent.
14

15

Simple static stress-tests employed in this exercise are intended to identify potential bank vulnerabilities and do
not reflect actual projections. The shocks applied were extreme, meant to stretch the system to its limits. Therefore,
the results should also be interpreted from this angle and not as scenario simulations.
16

When interest rates spiked in early 2009, default rates did increase, but much less than feared.

17

Capitalization is defined as equity over assets net of interest in suspense and provisions.

18

The test assumes banks cannot borrow from each other or the CBS.

42
After adjusting bank capital for credit risk, the possible consequences of changes in interest rates
and the exchange rate would leave banks with capital coverage of 27 to 34 percent of their loan
portfolio. Distribution of this risk is fairly even, however, two banks are slightly more at risk
than others.

Appendix V. Offshore Finance19
The authorities have revisited their offshore development strategy, taking into account
AML/CFT issues. The offshore financial center (OFC) had featured prominently in Seychelles‘
long-term strategy, published in 2007. It was seen as a means to diversify an economy heavily
reliant on tourism. Several pieces of key legislation were enacted. A location that bridges time
zones in Europe and the Middle East and low registration costs were key selling points for
Seychelles, which sought to exploit a niche market in view of high barriers to entry and
reputational risks of substandard business.
OFC activity is limited in Seychelles (annual turnover is estimated in the area US$25 million) and clusters around international business companies (IBCs), raising transparency
concerns. Two offshore banks operate in Seychelles: one is a subsidiary of a locally established
foreign bank, and a government bank holds equity in the second. The brisk growth in registration
of IBCs has ranked Seychelles second, worldwide. The absence of information on IBCs‘
beneficiary ownership and their use for asset management purposes has been criticized by the
OECD transparency forum. Indeed IBCs, which are not subject to taxation (except for a
registration fee of US$100), are neither required to divulge information on ownership in their
articles of association, nor to the registrar of companies. They maintain a share register but only
members can access accounts and records held at the registered office.20 The establishment of
Special License Companies (SLCs), Corporate Services Providers (CSPs) and trusts is also
noteworthy.21
Well established OFCs continue to thrive, but newcomers face less encouraging prospects.
The success of small island OFCs highlights factors such as partner-country investment and tax
laws, which are not easily replicated. In Mauritius for example, the Fund estimated the OFC
impact on local employment and economic activity to be marginal initially, but representing an
increasing share of financial activity over time, with positive effects on telecommunications,
professional services and worker retention.22 Newcomer OFCs face a choice between opening
their doors to second-rate business and experiencing fast growth in the sector, or limiting
themselves to high-quality legitimate business and gaining very little or no market share. The
danger of the former is that it only takes one scandal to unravel a reputation and several years to
19

Prepared by Marie-Therese Trasino.

20

BIS statistics include $1.3 billion in Seychelles residents‘ bank deposits, probably reflecting IBCs‘ deposits.

21

SLCs and CSPs differ from IBCs in that the registrar is privy to information on ownership that is outside the
public domain. These are considered as tax-residents, are covered by provisions of the Business Tax Act and benefit
from extensive double taxation agreements. In addition, CSPs are required to know and identify their principal
clients and owners of client companies and to subject their professional intermediaries to similar due diligence. As
far as trusts are concerned, the trust deed and letter of wishes are not deposited with the competent authority but they
must be produced if required for regulatory inspection.
22

Indeed, the Mauritius FSSA (SM/03/202) suggests that cost-efficiency considerations were important but
secondary, and that the comparative advantage of its OFC stems from DTTs and investment laws in India and South
Africa.

44
reverse the damage, while the latter carries high start-up costs with uncertainty in the magnitude
and timing of any pay-off.
In view of potential exposure to illicit activities, the authorities are focusing on AML/CFT.
Seychelles participates in several international initiatives, the most recent of which is the
ESAAMLG peer review. In reviewing the institutional and legal framework, and examining the
capacity, implementation and effectiveness of all regulatory systems, ESAAMLG identified
weaknesses which the authorities are addressing. The recently created Financial Intelligence Unit
conducts frequent on-site examinations and strengthened its operating procedures. In addition to
regulatory changes, the authorities regularly interact with peers (as in the Egmont Group).
Changes include a reorganization of the police force, the creation of a national drugs
enforcement agency, the review of criminal justice and capacity building for the FIU, police,
attorney general‘s office and offshore practitioners.

SEYCHELLES: LETTER OF INTENT

Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
December 3, 2010
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:

1.
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) describes
Seychelles‘ performance through September 2010, and updates the policies that were laid up in
the MEFPs dated December 3, 2009 and June 1, 2010 for the remainder of 2010 and for 2011.
2.
We request completion of the second review under our Extended Arrangement
(EFF), the release of the fifth tranche of SDR 1.76 million (20 percent of quota), rephasing
of disbursements and establishment of end-June 2011 and end-December 2011
performance criteria (PCs). All the quantitative performance criteria at end-September 2010
were met. We remain committed to implement two reforms that are structural benchmarks for
end-September 2010 and end-November 2010 respectively. The Customs Management Act was
submitted in November 2010 to the National Assembly. We have initiated the work on the new
Chart of Accounts and we plan to complete the work in the next 18 to 24 months with the
assistance of the Fund.
3.
The EFF continues to accompany a comprehensive medium-term structural reform
strategy aimed at consolidating macroeconomic stability and securing growth; and to guide our
macroeconomic policies over the next two years. With the successful conclusion of our public
debt restructuring we have restored the prospect of debt sustainability.
4.
We believe that the economic and financial policies set forth in the MEFP are
sufficient to ensure that the objectives of the program will continue to be met. We stand
ready to take any further measures that may prove necessary to meet our objectives. We will
consult with the Fund on the adoption of these measures, and in advance of revisions to the
policies contained in the MEFP, in accordance with the Fund‘s policies on such consultations.
We remain committed to full implementation of the recommendations of the Fund‘s safeguards
assessment of the Central Bank of Seychelles (CBS).
5.
It is expected that the third review of the arrangement under the EFF will be
completed by end-March 2011, that the fourth review will be completed by end-September
2011, and that the fifth review will be completed by end-March 2012. Financing assurances
reviews will continue as long as public debt arrears remain outstanding.

6.
In line with our commitment to transparency, we request that the IMF publish this
letter, the MEFP, the technical memorandum of understanding (TMU), and the staff
report. We will simultaneously publish these documents in Seychelles.
Sincerely yours,

ATTACHMENT 1
SEYCHELLES: SUPPLEMENTARY MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC, FINANCIAL AND STRUCTURAL
REFORM POLICIES FOR 2010–11
I.

INTRODUCTION

This document:


Reviews macroeconomic and financial performance under our Extended Arrangement
(EFF) arrangement through end-September 2010 and;



Updates the MEFP of June 1st, 2010, detailing our policy commitment through December
2011.
II.

MACROECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CONTEXT AND SHORT TERM OUTLOOK

1.
Macroeconomic trends evolved favorably over 2010, exceeding expectations. We
have revised our GDP growth forecast for 2010 upwards from 4 percent to more than 6 percent,
driven by higher than expected activity in the tourism, construction and manufacturing sectors.
Tourism arrivals are projected to grow by around 10% in 2010, reflecting a resurgence in the
sector after weakness immediately following the global financial crisis in 2008-09. As a result,
the turnover in euro terms of the tourism sector is increasing, contrary to our initial projections
at the start of the year. Local manufacturers have benefitted from increased domestic demand,
resulting in higher levels of production, particularly in the first half of the year.
2.
Inflationary pressures remain contained despite monetary policy easing. Inflation
has been virtually flat over the course of the year, climbing at an average rate of 0.2 percent per
month since April 2010. The 91-day T bill rate is around 1.5 percent, down from 4 percent at
the start of the year. Private credit growth has gained momentum, rising by around 18 percent in
the month ending September 2010 compared to December last year despite the slow decrease of
banks‘ lending rates. After depreciating modestly against the US dollar earlier in the year, the
rupee has remained stable over the past few months.
3.
With the rebound of growth, the external current account deficit is expected to
widen in 2010. Imports have been growing faster than exports reflecting the impact of stronger
domestic demand as well as foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows and some large
construction projects entirely financed from abroad. Foreign exchange reserves have continued
to grow, reaching 2.2 months of imports in September.
III.

PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION

4.
All quantitative performance criteria at end-September were comfortably achieved
(Table 2). The government has exceeded its primary balance target by 2.4 percentage points of
GDP. This has been driven primarily by higher revenues, reflecting stronger-than-expected

48
imports, higher business tax receipts and dividends from public enterprises. We introduced the
new income tax regime in July this year, and increased the GST on tourism from 10 percent to
12 percent from November 1. The new personal income tax (PIT) introduced in July 2010
replaces the previous social security contributions and expands the tax base. The primary fiscal
surplus for 2010 is now projected to be 9.4 percent of GDP, representing an over-performance
of two percentage points of GDP compared with the program target. The reserve money and
NIR targets have also been met with comfortable margins, while inflation remained low,
reflecting appropriateness of the monetary policy stance.
5.
However, two structural benchmarks have been delayed. The first is the new
Customs Management Act which is expected to be submitted to the National Assembly in early
December, 2010. The delay from September arose as a result of the capacity constraints in
processing a 300-page piece of legislation. The second is the adoption of a new chart of
accounts for the 2011 budget. Following discussions with IMF advisors, we agree that the
scope of changes that could potentially be taken to upgrade our chart of accounts is
considerably greater than originally anticipated. We are aiming to introduce a new version of
the chart of accounts in the 2012 Budget. Other than these two measures, our ambitious
structural reform agenda – focused on reducing the role of Government in the economy and
improving the business environment – remains on track. The details of the measures are
covered below, and our work with other development partners (World Bank, AfDB and EU)
continues.
Medium Term Macro Framework
6.
The outlook for the economy is a continued recovery over the medium term, albeit
at a slower rate than in 2010. After rebounding strongly in 2010, we expect growth in the
tourism sector to slow to single digits, consistent with the sluggish growth forecast for Europe
(the source of most of our tourists). Similarly, growth in the construction sector will slow in
2011 following the completion of a major construction project that boosted growth in 2010.
Nonetheless, we expect a real GDP growth in 2011 of 4.3 percent, rising to 5 percent in 201213. Inflation, after having been close to zero in 2010, is expected to revert to an average rate of
3 percent in 2011 and 2012. The current account deficit is expected to decline in 2011 and
2012, reflecting mostly lower FDI-related inflows and robust export growth. We continue to
target an increase in gross international reserves to 3 months of imports by 2012, up from a
projected 2.3 months at end-2010.
7.
Fiscal rebalancing remains on track. With the maintenance of a substantial
government budget primary surplus in 2011 and 2012, the stock of public debt will continue to
decline, from 76 percent of GDP at end 2010 to around 65 percent at end- 2012; the bulk of the
decline will come from a reduction in the domestic government debt. Beyond 2012 the
Government plans to gradually reduce primary budget surpluses in line with our strategy to
limit public debt to less than 50 percent of GDP by 2018.
8.
Despite our forecasts, we are mindful of the risks to our medium-term projections.
Downside risks include: a sluggish global economic recovery and a weak euro, which would

49
dampen the number of tourists emanating from Europe; inadequate public infrastructure such as
utilities and roads to support continued economic growth; and security risks associated with the
threats to shipping routes from piracy. We are working hard to mitigate these risks, including
through promoting Seychelles as a tourism destination outside Europe, stepped-up investment in
and reforms of public utilities, and international cooperation to counter piracy disruptions.
Policies for 2011
9.

The major objectives of our EFF-supported program remain to:


consolidate macroeconomic stability;



improve economic efficiency and durably raise growth through the implementation
of a second generation of structural reforms; and



maintain a path of debt reduction consistent with external sustainability.

The policies we will pursue in 2011 to achieve these objectives are outlined below.
A. Fiscal Policy
10.
The 2011 budget aims at achieving a primary surplus of 5 percent of GDP. This
target is lower than the original target under the EFF supported program of 6 percent of GDP,
but remains consistent with the medium-term debt and fiscal sustainability targets. The
Government‘s strong fiscal performance in 2010 has created the fiscal space for additional
spending, in particular on priority infrastructure investment and social expenditure.
11.
Growth in government revenue in 2011 reflects mostly accounting changes,
including the consolidation of government entities in the budget and one-off factors
affecting 2010. Abstracting from budget presentation changes (which increase revenue by
2.2 percentage points of GDP), the government revenue to GDP ratio will decline by 1.5 percent
as the 2011 Budget estimates are adjusted to reflect one-off factors affecting 2010 (such as
exceptionally high business tax rates and payments from Nouvobanq and the renegotiated
shareholders agreement of the tuna cannery). The changes are accounted for in the table below.
Policy changes (in GST and Income Tax) are aimed at further rationalizing the tax system and
harmonizing rates between sectors, they represent an increase of 0.4 percent of GDP.
12.
Current primary expenditure is expected to rise as the Government implements
wage reforms and some recruitment for priority sectors. Abstracting from classification
changes (2.0 percentage points of GDP), the net increase is equivalent to 0.8 percent of GDP.
The key drivers of expenditure increase are outlined in the table below.

13.
Capital expenditures will continue to be directed to priority areas to support
continued economic growth. In percentage of GDP, capital expenditures will rise by
1.5 percent in 2011. This includes some large foreign-financed projects, such as a new coast
guard facility and landfill. Capital grants to the Public Utilities Company will amount to
1.5 percentage points of GDP. Other key projects include the rehabilitation of the main Victoria
hospital, and of education facilities, and the pursuit of an important housing project in
Perseverance Island, that also benefits from important external financing.
14.
We will establish a contingency reserve of SR 50 million in the 2011 budget. We plan to
release this reserve for capital investments by a number of ministries, starting in July 2011,
provided that the revenue targets for June 2011 are met.
B. Tax Reform
15.
The reform of the tax system launched at the start of 2010 continues. The base has
been broadened, and the system is becoming increasingly simple, fair and equitable as the
various stages of reform come into effect, with no new tax incentives and exemptions. From
January 1, 2011 with the increase in the personal income tax rate paid by expatriates, there will
be one harmonized rate of personal income tax for all employees in all sectors.
16.
The final major tax scheduled for introduction is the Value Added Tax (VAT). The
introduction of the VAT is aimed at improving integration in the economy, broadening of the
base, elimination of cascading, and increased efficiency and fairness. We have already started
discussions with a number of stakeholders – including the Chamber of Commerce, retailers
association and civil society organizations – to ensure that the legislative framework is a
practical one, understood by both users and administrators. The legislation work is advanced,
and we aim to present the bill to the National Assembly by end-December 2010. This will give
us 18 months to carry out an extensive education campaign for the population; recruit new staff;
install necessary infrastructure; and ensure that the staff of the Seychelles Revenue Commission
(SRC) are sufficiently equipped for the introduction of the VAT. The VAT regulations
including rates, thresholds and exemptions will be submitted for approval by Cabinet by endJune 2011.
17.
In addition, we are pursuing further reforms to the administration of the tax
system. The improvement of the SRC governance continues, with the creation of a Large
Taxpayer Unit already complete. The newly created unit will segregate its staff to particular
sectors to ensure better understanding of sector-trends, allowing for more targeted use of the
Audit Team. We will also pursue the simplification of the various systems for identifying
taxpayers and greater cooperation between customers and SRC to monitor the consistency of
compliance with VAT and customs taxation.

52
C. Public Financial Management
18.
Our progress in strengthening public financial management continues, in line with
Fund recommendations. The revised Budget Classification policy for public entities will be
fully implemented by the end of 2010. Under this system, budget-dependent public bodies are
classified into three groups: (1) providers of specialized services that are core to the running of
the country; (2) regulatory authorities; and (3) providers of commercial services essential to the
socio-economic development of the country. The classification policy sets out the operational
and budget arrangements for each group, and has resulted in most entities in groups 1 and 2
being included in the budget documents. The information generated by this enhanced budget
reporting will facilitate assessments of the commercialization and privatization of certain public
entities, in line with our broader strategy of reducing the role of the state in the economy.
19.
To assess the progress already made and identify the next steps, we will undertake a
new assessment of the government‘s financial operations under the EU‘s Public Expenditure
and Financial Accountability (PEFA) standards in early 2011 with the assistance of the
European Union.
20.
We will update our Chart of Accounts to support improved decision-making on the
allocation of resources. We will establish a cross-agency committee in January 2011 which
will identify our key needs and possible reforms, with the assistance of the IMF. A plan of
action will be submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers before end of April 2011 with the aim of
introducing the new Chart of Accounts in the 2012 Budget. We will also review the
Accounting Standards of Financial Statement to ensure it is consistent with International Public
Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS), by September 2011.
21.
We continue to invest in the capacity of Government officials to oversee and
contribute to public financial management. We are providing budget management training
for departmental budget officers and will revise the Financial Instructions and Accounting
Manual by June 2011. Within the Ministry of Finance we are building capacity to analyze
capital expenditure proposals, which will facilitate improved allocation of our capital
expenditure budget.
22.
Our fiscal policy objectives will be supported by strengthened budget processes.
The main changes from the 2010 Budget process, which have been put in place since the last
MEFP are:
a. Our 2011 Budget has moved to a medium-term budgeting framework, presenting
the government’s fiscal and economic projections over a three-year horizon.
b. The 2011 budget process commenced in June 2010 with Cabinet‘s discussion of
the Budget Strategy and Outlook (BSO) document, which set the fiscal context
and established the government‘s priorities.
c. All ministries and budget dependent entities used a standard template to submit
their recurrent and capital expenditure proposals to the Ministry of Finance

53
providing detailed costing. The Ministry of Finance‘s capacity to scrutinize these
expenditure proposals has been enhanced through increased resources.
d. Mid-year formal expenditure reviews were carried out, with detailed
reconciliation of budget estimates with quarterly and year-end outcomes.
e. In parallel, our macroeconomic and revenue forecasting capacity has been
enhanced through the establishment of a dedicated branch within the Ministry of
Finance, which is now fully operational.
23.
Further improvements will be made through amendments to our Public Finance
Bill. These amendments will seek to reflect recent operational improvements in public financial
management in the legal framework, introducing principles such as transparency,
accountability, medium-term stability and budget performance into the Bill and extending its
coverage to budget formulation and budget execution processes, in line with Fund
recommendations. The law would also extend the National Assembly‘s oversight of the budget
to include the capital expenditure budget, in addition to current expenditures. Given the
complexity and significance of this reform we will seek further Fund advice on developing and
implementing the legislation. The Public Finance Bill will be submitted to Cabinet for approval
by the end of September 2011.
24.
We are improving the management and operation of the Pension Fund and the
Social Security Fund. As the first step toward achieving actuarial equilibrium in the Pension
Fund, we are modifying the contribution system for all employees from January 1, 2011.
Instead of a fixed contribution paid by the employee and the employer, the contribution will
become a fixed percentage of the employee‘s salary, payable by both parties. The rate will be
1.0 percent for 2011 and move to 1.5 percent from January 2012. On the Social Security Fund,
the Social Security Act was passed in July, and the Government has appointed a Board of
Trustees under the new Act in order to ensure professional and independent management of its
assets. Going forward, a policy will be formulated outlining the investment objectives of these
assets by September 2011, using the recommendations of the recent report of the World Bank.
D. Public Enterprise Reform
Non-Financial Institutions
25.
Our commitment to improving our capacity to invest in public infrastructure has
not abated, particularly regarding the urgent needs in the utilities sector. We are in
negotiations with BADEA regarding the sourcing of an expert to carry out the study on the
tariffs of the Public Utilities Company (PUC) planned for the first half of 2011. The
government‘s objective is to improve the quality of service provision in the utilities sector,
which over the long-term will require PUC to implement a tariff policy that is consistent with
full cost recovery and meeting future investment needs. We will complete a study on the
optimal structure and levels of tariffs by end-July 2011. In addition, we will implement tariff
adjustments to fuel price variations after September 2011.

54
26.
The government is pursuing a public enterprise reform strategy aimed at achieving
greater efficiency, transparency and accountability.
a. Following the introduction of the Public Enterprise Monitoring and Control Act in
late 2009, the Public and Financial Accounts Committee has started its monitoring
work, including through hearings of the management of several public enterprises.
The Committee, established by the Act to enhance governance, comprises
members of the National Assembly, and has access to the audited accounts of the
public enterprises.
b. The bulk of the recommendations made by the management audits of the public
entities have been put in force, resulting in improved governance standards of
these entities. The Public Enterprise Monitoring Division (PEMD) will also
present a policy paper to Cabinet recommending a set of procedures for the
selection criteria for Board members in the first quarter of 2011.
c. A report following a strategic assessment of the national airline has been
submitted by the international aviation consultants who conducted their work in
the latter half of this year. The airline has recently presented its reply to these
recommendations to Cabinet, which is considering its response.
d. Since the last MEFP, the new Postal Sector Act has come into force which
establishes the postal service as a fully independent commercial entity, outside of
the Government budget.
e. Following the implementation of the new Budget Reclassification policy, we will
develop a privatization plan for non-strategic public enterprises which do not
serve public policy goals by the end of September 2011.
Financial Institutions
27.
The government, together with the CBS, is strengthening the management and
oversight of public financial institutions and assessing the case for continued state ownership.
a. The financial audit of the Housing Finance Corporation has been completed, and
the recommendations submitted to the CBS. In addition, by June 2011, we will
submit for Cabinet‘s adoption, an action plan for house financing policy that
limits the role of the public sector, drawing on the recommendations of the FIRST
Initiative‘s report.
b. It is government‘s policy to privatize Nouvobanq in the context of our mediumterm strategy. The IFC is scheduled to conduct an evaluation of the state-owned
banks in December 2010 and make recommendations regarding the feasibility of
their privatization shortly thereafter. The Government is expected to respond to
these recommendations and formulate a privatization strategy by the end of June
2011. We recognize that, in the longer term, privatization of the two publiclyowned deposit taking institutions – Seychelles Savings Bank and Nouvobanq could bring new technology, strengthen management and fresh capital to our
banking system, stimulate competition and enhance the quality of bank services.

55
In the near-term, however, both institutions are performing well financially,
present limited risk to the government‘s balance sheet and are playing a leading
role in promoting financial intermediation and credit creation.
E. Monetary and Financial Sector Policies
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
28.
The Central Bank of Seychelles (CBS) will continue to rely on reserve money
targeting as its monetary policy framework. In the short to medium term CBS will continue
to use Repos as the main instrument to guide short-term interest rates while Deposit Auction
Arrangement (DAA) and Credit Auction Arrangement (CAA), and foreign exchange Swaps will
be used for fine tuning. The Bank will continue to increase its range of monetary instruments to
allow it to achieve greater flexibility in its market interventions.
29.
The CBS and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) will seek to enhance the effectiveness
of liquidity management to ensure the effectiveness of monetary policy framework and to
contribute to financial sector deepening. In the context of its liquidity forecasting and reserve
money programming framework, the CBS and MOF will continue to work closely on the T-bill
issuance profile to promote the smooth functioning of the market and provide for the
development of a benchmark yield curve. A calendar of weekly T-bill issuance is
communicated four weeks in advance in order to inform the market of the quantity of paper to
be issued. This has helped improve the predictability of the securities market and has helped
banks in better managing their liquidity.
30.
The reduction in Government’s domestic debt poses a major challenge for
monetary policy. A reduction in the issuance of treasury bills as the Government continues to
retire its domestic debt has resulted in a marked increase in commercial bank liquidity. The
CBS will work in tandem with the Ministry of Finance to devise a strategy for dealing with this
situation to ensure that the objective of debt reduction does not compromise the effectiveness of
the transmission mechanism of monetary policy and the development of the financial system.
Specifically, should liquidity persist, the MoF stands ready to issue up to SR 250 million of
T-bills for monetary policy purposes, to help the CBS absorb at least part of excess liquidity and
thereby share the burden of sterilization costs.
31.
We remain committed to a floating exchange rate regime, which has served
Seychelles well since the beginning of the economic reforms. The CBS will maintain its
policy of intervening in the foreign exchange market only to smooth out excessive volatility and
ensure orderly market conditions. The CBS will continue to work closely with banks and make
use of technical assistance from the IMF and other institutions to improve the efficiency of the
inter-bank market. In this context we are working on a code of conduct which will guide all
participants in the foreign exchange as well as in the money market.

56
32.
The implementation of an integrated (core) banking system is on course to go live
on December 01, 2010. This project will assist the CBS in improving the efficiency of its
operations and significantly mitigate risks associated with having a multitude of software.
33.
The recapitalization of the CBS has progressed well. The Government made two
rounds of capital injection for R63 million each through treasury bills in June and September
2010, and a final injection of R62 million is planned in December. This will boost CBS‘
capitalization level to 10 percent of monetary liabilities by the end of the year, as per the
requirements of the CBS Act, as amended in 2009. This will strengthen the balance sheet of the
CBS and enhance its portfolio of tradable securities to be used in open market operations.
34.
As external reserves continue to accumulate, the CBS will need to continue to
strengthen its reserve management activities. Given its internal capacity constraints, the
CBS has taken a prudent approach to its reserve management program, limiting the use of
external parties to manage its reserve asset to the World Bank through its Reserve Advisory and
Management Program (RAMP), the Asset Management services of the Bank for International
Settlement (BIS), and the Crown Agent, which also has a long standing reputation of working
with central banks. Discussions with all three institutions are at an advanced stage and CBS
expects to enter into formal arrangements with them in early 2011. Besides their more
favorable terms in investing a portion of CBS‘ external reserves, these institutions will also
provide technical assistance in the area of capacity building and training of CBS internal
managers to better equip CBS staff in management of reserves.
35.
The CBS continues to make good progress in modernizing the national payment
system. Several important steps were taken in 2009 and continue in 2010, including: (i) establishment of a complete requirements and standards document for electronic funds transfers that
replaced the manual settlement system; (ii) adoption of the new cheque standard documents in
July 2009; (iii) formalization of the new clearing house rules in April 2010; and (iv) introduction of the National Clearing and Settlement system Act in July 2010. This legislation provides
a formal legal base for the National Payment Systems and creates it as a legal entity.
Furthermore it will provide a clear mandate for the undertaking of the payment systems
oversight, entry and participation criteria, recognition and supervision of systems for clearance
and settlement. Following the implementation of the Core Banking System, the new platform
will facilitate the introduction of new payment systems such as an Electronic Clearing House
and the introduction of a local rupee Switching System to facilitate the settlement of local
ATM/POS transactions. Additionally, the CBS will continue to promote the use of electronic
funds transfer and the use of plastic card, as well as implement a real time gross settlement
system in 2011/2012.
36.
The CBS has embarked on an exercise to introduce a formal risk management
framework. In May 2010 a full risk assessment of the CBS was conducted at its own initiative,
by a reputable international audit firm. The draft reports of this evaluation along with a draft
risk policy and necessary tools to implement a robust strategic risk framework have been
submitted to CBS for comments. The CBS has set up a risk implementation committee (RIC) to

57
drive the risk framework by addressing the risks identified and taking responsibility of ongoing
risk assessments through Division Heads and risk monitoring through the Internal Audit
Division (IAD). This risk assessment and its findings will also allow the CBS to adopt a riskbased internal audit framework in line with the recommendations of the latest Safeguards
Assessment report. This will induce a training plan to support the new internal audit and risk
oversight functions of CBS.
37.
CBS has completed its business continuity plan (BCP), ahead of the planned
deadline of end-2010. The BCP was prepared by a reputable international consulting firm in
close consultation with CBS staff. An action plan has been submitted to the CBS Management
and this will act as the roadmap for implement of this plan.
Financial Sector Reforms
38.
Substantial progress has been made in developing a risk-based supervision
framework, with IMF technical assistance. The CBS Board recently fully approved the
CAMELS123bank rating system, and it has already been fully adopted in a recent onsite
examination of a commercial bank. Frequent examinations are being conducted as per the
procedural manuals on each component of the bank rating system. In the context of this riskbased approach the CBS will require banks to submit business plans on an annual basis by end2011. This will allow the supervision staff to enhance micro-prudential supervision of financial
institutions and beef up staff capacity in terms of analysis of these business plans on an ongoing
basis. The CBS is also working toward further developing the CAELS2 approach to offsite
supervision as well as the enhancement of macroprudential supervision. In addition minimum
capital for banks has been doubled, with a three year transition period granted to existing banks
which do not meet the new requirement.
24

39.
The CBS continues to be proactive in its effort to safeguard financial sector
stability. At the request of CBS, the Toronto Centre carried out a four day workshop to a team
of Central Bank, Ministry of Finance and Seychelles International Business Authority staff on
crisis preparedness in October 2010. This has initiated work on Seychelles' crisis binder which
contains tabs on, inter alia communication and co-ordination strategies, resolution options and
challenges which may impede effective resolution of a crisis. An action plan will be devised to
address gaps which have been identified during the exercise. The first draft of the crisis binder
will be submitted to Toronto Centre for its review.
40.
Seychelles will continue its efforts to promote transparency in the offshore financial
sector through strengthened supervision by CBS in coordination with the Seychelles

International Business Authority, and the Financial Intelligence Unit. To that effect, further to a
review which has been conducted by the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of
Information for Tax Purposes, Seychelles has expressed to the organization its commitment to
ascertain that the country's legal framework supports and upholds the principle of transparency
and exchange of information.
41.
We are committed to encouraging a sound and efficient insurance sector that
promotes policyholder confidence. The FIRST Initiative has agreed to give technical
assistance to CBS to strengthen insurance supervision. A mission is slated for December 2010
and will include a review of the regulatory framework and preparation of manuals for
conducting examination of insurance and insurance-related companies.
42.
CBS will continue to strengthen supervision of banks and other non-bank financial
institutions under its supervisory ambit. New regulations on Capital Adequacy and Credit
Classification and Provisioning have been formally adopted in November 2010. These
regulations ensure conformity with international best practices, including provisioning standards
as per international norms and certain components of Basel II.
43.
In line with its new mandate the CBS has already began supervising the Housing
Finance Company (HFC) and the Development Bank of Seychelles (DBS). The CBS will
use the results of the recent special audits by external auditors of HFC and DBS as a basis to
begin its supervision of the institutions on a risk-based approach, which will include offsite as
well as onsite examinations of these institutions. Moreover the recent strategic assessment of
these same institutions by the FIRST Initiative will allow the Government to make a more
fundamental decision on the future of these institutions.
44.
CBS will make increasing use of stress testing in its effort to evaluate the safety and
soundness of institutions under its supervision. To that effect the recently conducted stress
test devised by the MCM expert will be used as benchmark. The stress test results will guide the
CBS examiners to target specific areas of concern.
45.
The banking system currently suffers from a lack of competition that is hampering
credit growth and the development of the banking sector. Existing barriers to credit
development include excessive prepayment penalties, long delays in registering guarantees and
collateral, as well as excessively long periods for the court system to liquidate the collaterals.
Moreover, the absence of a credit rating system and limited disclosures by banks under the
Financial Institutions Act (FIA) prevent adequate assessments of potential clients‘
creditworthiness. In light of these constraints the CBS is carrying out a study to identify current
uncompetitive practices and barriers, and based on the results it will draw up an action plan to
address these shortcomings. Some of these measures will require an amendment of the FIA,
which is planned for end-April 2011.
46.
The CBS is committed to promoting fair competition in the financial sector to
ensure consumer protection and maintain a healthy and competitive financial system. In
that respect the CBS will work in close liaison with the Fair Trading Commission and the

59
Seychelles Bankers Association to achieve this goal. The initial step is to launch a public
awareness campaign on different financial products. CBS will also review its requirements for
disclosure of banks‘ fees and charges to ensure greater transparency toward the public.

F. Balance of Payments
External Debt Restructuring
47.
We are making headway in normalizing relations with those remaining external
creditors with whom restructuring agreements had yet to be concluded at the time the last
MEFP was prepared. As of end-November, restructuring agreements covering approximately
US$631million, or around 91 percent of the debt eligible for restructuring have been reached. In
aggregate, these agreements have cancelled approximately US$310 million in principal, accrued
interest, and other charges. The remaining balances have by and large been rescheduled over
periods exceeding 17 years at low rates of interest, with the bulk of the foreign currency debt
owed to local commercial banks converted into rupees.
48.
The entirety of foreign currency debts owed to locally-based commercial banks has
now been successfully restructured. In total, agreements covering nine facilities outstanding
to local and local affiliates of foreign banks have been concluded. Two of these facilities were
bought back at a steep discount. Almost all of the remaining claims have been converted into
rupees at market rates, and rescheduled over the long term, often for periods exceeding
30 years. Material grace periods on principal apply to all. Floating interest rates have been
agreed in most cases, at modest fixed margins over six-month or one-year treasury bills. The
Government has also concluded, or is in the process of concluding, eight of the 11 bilateral
agreements that implement the April 2009 Paris Club agreement. Another is in the advanced

60
stages of negotiation. We expect to receive the two remaining draft agreements from creditors
shortly.
49.
The Government will persevere with its efforts to conclude restructuring
agreements on comparable terms with the few remaining commercial bank and non-Paris
Club official bilateral creditors holding unresolved claims. In principle agreements have
been reached with all non-Paris Club official bilateral creditors holding unresolved claims, and
implementation is expected over the course of the fourth quarter of 2010. In principle
agreements have also been reached with the two remaining commercial bank creditors, both of
which are foreign institutions. The smaller of these two claims is the uninsured portion of an
export credit officially supported by a non-Paris Club official bilateral creditor that has already
agreed to restructure its claim on Paris Club terms.
Trade Policies
50.
We remain committed to a liberal foreign trade policy. Our import tariff regime is
already highly liberal, with more than 94% of all tariff lines set at zero. Nonetheless, we are
undertaking measures to modernize our trade regime to bring it into conformity with our
regional, bilateral and international trade obligations. We remain committed to the WTO
accession process, which we are pursuing as a priority.
51.
We are pursuing trade negotiations with the European Union. We have signed in
August 2009 with the EU an interim European Partnership Agreement (EPA) together with
Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The agreement ensures that our
exports into the EU are not subject to duties or quota. In exchange, we will gradually phase out
the maximum duty rates applicable to 98 percent of our imports from the EU.
G. National Statistics
52.
We remain strongly committed to improving the quality, periodicity, and timeliness
of macroeconomic and financial statistics. A new National Statistics Act (NSA) was
approved by the National Assembly in July 2010, creating the National Bureau of Statistics
(NBS), reinforcing its independence and strengthening its mandate to collect data compared to
its predecessor (NSB). The governing Board, which is independent of government, comprises
members from organizations (both public and private) that are directly affecting and/or affected
by the NBS statistics. The Bureau has seen its current budget increased in a bid to increase
capacity building.
53.
We are moving to address deficiencies in key macroeconomic data – especially
GDP estimates and external sector statistics – to improve their usefulness for economic
analysis and policy formulation. To this effect, a strategic plan will be adopted by endFebruary 2011 which will map out our path toward SDDS and IIP6 compliance. The IMF sent a
mission to work on quarterly National Accounts in November 2010, and another to assist with
the development of an Industrial Index and Producer Price Index to bring us in line with
international best practice, and implementation of the IMF‘s Special Data Dissemination

61
Standard (SDDS). We aim to submit an advance release calendar for SDDS compliance by mid2012. We will increase co-ordination across government agencies to improve quality and
consistency in the FDI statistics. The Ministry of Employment will reinforce its efforts to
produce high-frequency labor market data. We have requested further technical assistance from
the Fund (on fiscal and national accounts) and the World Bank (to strengthen the management
and operations of the NSB).
IV.

PROGRAM MONITORING

54.
The EFF-supported program will be monitored by semi-annual program reviews,
with semi-annual quantitative performance criteria and disbursements. We propose to
move to a new program review schedule to better synchronize with our budget cycle, with the
new test dates being December and June. The semi-annual quantitative performance criteria
(QPCs) for 2011 are shown in Table 2. The structural benchmarks for 2011 are shown in
Table 3.
55.
The attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) defines the
quantitative performance criteria, indicative targets and adjusters under the program.
Seychelles will avoid introducing new exchange restrictions, multiple currency practices, or
bilateral payments agreements in contradiction with Article VIII of the IMF‘s Articles of
Agreement and imposing any import restrictions for balance of payments reasons. We stand
ready to adopt any additional measures, in consultation with IMF staff, which may become
necessary to ensure program success.

ATTACHMENT 2
SEYCHELLES: TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
1.
This technical memorandum of understanding presents the definitions of variables
included in the quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets set out in the
memorandum of economic and financial policies (MEFP), the key assumptions, and the
reporting requirements of the Government and the Central Bank of Seychelles (CBS) needed to
adequately monitor economic and financial developments. The quantitative performance criteria
and indicative targets, and the benchmarks for 2010-11 are listed in Tables 1 and 3 of the MEFP,
respectively.
I. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
A. Net International Reserves of the CBS (Floor)
Definition
2.
Net international reserves (NIR) of the CBS are defined for program monitoring
purposes as reserve assets of the CBS, minus reserve liabilities of the CBS (including liabilities
to the IMF). Reserve assets of the CBS are claims on nonresidents that are readily available
(i.e., liquid and marketable assets, free of any pledges or encumberments and excluding project
balances and blocked or escrow accounts, and bank reserves in foreign currency maintained for
the purpose of meeting the reserve requirements), controlled by the CBS, and held for the
purpose of intervening in foreign exchange markets. They include holdings of SDRs, holdings
of foreign exchange, demand and short-term deposits at foreign banks abroad, fixed-term
deposits abroad that can be liquidated without penalty, and any holdings of investment-grade
securities. Reserve liabilities of the CBS comprise liabilities to nonresidents contracted by the
CBS, any net off-balance-sheet position of the CBS (futures, forwards, swaps, or options) with
either residents or nonresidents, including those to the IMF.
Calculation method
3.
For program monitoring purposes, reserves assets and liabilities at each test date, must
be converted into U.S. dollars using the end of period exchange rates assumed in the program.
MONITORING AND REPORTING
4.
At each program test date, the quarterly net international reserves data submitted by the
CBS to the IMF will be audited by the CBS external auditors in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing, to ensure conformity with the program definition and calculation
methods. Reports will be submitted to the CBS, with a copy to the IMF, no later than two
months after each test date.

65
Adjusters
5.
The floor on the CBS‘s NIR will be adjusted upward (downward) by the amount by
which the external non-project loans and cash grants exceeds (falls short of) the amounts
assumed in the program (MEFP Table 1). The floors will also be adjusted upwards
(downwards) by the amount that external debt service payments fall short (exceed) the amounts
assumed in the program.
B. Reserve Money (Ceiling)
Definition
6.
Reserve money is equivalent to currency issued and deposits held by financial
institutions at the central bank (bank reserves), including those denominated in foreign
currencies. Evaluation of performance of reserve money with respect to the program ceiling will
be done at the program accounting exchange rate.
Monitoring and reporting
7.
For each program test date, the quarterly reserve money data submitted by the CBS to
the IMF will be audited by the CBS‘ external auditors in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing, to ensure conformity with the program definition. Reports will be
submitted to the CBS, with a copy to the IMF, no later than two months after each test date.
C. Primary Balance of the Consolidated Government (Cumulative Floor)
8.
The consolidated government primary balance from above the line on a commitment
basis is defined as total consolidated government and social security fund revenues (excluding
privatization and long-term lease income receipts) less all noninterest (primary) expenditures of
the government and social security fund.
D. Public External Debt (Ceiling)
9.
The ceiling applies to the contracting or guaranteeing of new external liabilities by the
public sector (including the central government, the CBS, and all public agencies and
parastatals for operations that are not directly linked to commercial activities). The ceiling does
not apply to the use of Fund resources, operations related to external debt restructuring; normal
import related credits; purchases of treasury securities by nonresidents; or borrowing by
parastatals in the conduct of normal commercial operations. The non-zero ceilings on the
contracting or guaranteeing of external debt are to allow for normal public project finance and
program support from multilateral institutions exclusively. Debt shall be valued in U.S. dollars
at program exchange rates. A zero sub-ceiling on short-term external debt applies continuously
to the contracting or guaranteeing of short-term external debt by the public sector, with an
original maturity of up to and including one year.

66
10.
For the purpose of this performance criterion, the term ―debt‖ has the meaning set forth
in point No. 9 of the Executive Board‘s Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to
Foreign Debt (Decision No. 12274-(00/85)). Debt is understood to mean a current, non
contingent liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in
the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one
or more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some future points in
time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the
contract. The ceiling on contracting official and officially guaranteed external debt includes all
form of debt, including:
a.

loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of an
undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits,
bonds, debentures, commercial loans, and buyers credits) and temporary
exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which
the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by
repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase
agreements and official swap arrangements);

b.

suppliers credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer
payments until some time after the date on which the goods are delivered or
services are provided; and,

c.

leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has
the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter
than the total expected service life of the property, while the leasor retains title to
the property. The debt is the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all
lease payments expected to be made during the period of the agreement excluding
those payments that cover the operation, repair, or maintenance of the property.

d.

Arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to
make payment under a contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt.
E. External Arrears of the Public Sector

11.
The nonaccumulation of arrears to external creditors will be a continuous performance
criterion under the program. External payments arrears for program monitoring purposes are
defined as the amount of external debt service due and not paid within the contractually agreed
period, including contractual and late interest. Arrears resulting from the nonpayment of debt
service for which a clearance framework has been agreed or a rescheduling agreement is sought
are excluded from this definition.
F. Budget Expenditure Arrears
12.
The nonaccumulation of budget expenditure arrears will be a continuous performance
criterion under the program. Budget expenditure arrears are defined as the sum of (1) any
invoice that has been received by a spending agency from a supplier of goods, services, and

67
capital goods delivered and verified, and for which payment has not been made within the
contractually agreed period, or in the absence of a grace period, within 30 days; (2) unpaid
wages, pensions, or transfers, pending for longer than 30 days to domestic or foreign residents,
irrespective of the currency denomination of the debt.
II. Data and Information
13.
The Seychelles authorities (government and CBS) will provide Fund staff with the
following data and information according to the schedule provided.
The CBS will report
Weekly (within one week from the end of the period)

Reserve money.

Foreign exchange reserves position.



Monthly public debt report.
14.
The government and CBS will consult with Fund staff on all economic and financial
measures that would have an impact on program implementation, and will provide any
additional relevant information as requested by Fund staff.

VII. Implementation of HIPC Initiative: Not applicable
VIII. Safeguards Assessments:
The Central Bank of Seychelles (CBS) was subject to a safeguards assessment with
respect to the Stand-By Arrangement for Seychelles. The assessment completed in 2008
found high risks in all areas of the CBS‘s safeguards framework, and several measures
were included in the program. An update assessment in relation to the Extended Fund
Facility, which was completed in July 2010, has found that the authorities have
implemented most of the measures recommended by the 2008 assessment. In particular,
governance oversight at the CBS is now exercised by the Board and management
committees, and transparency improved through application of International Financial
Reporting Standards and the publication of financial statements that have been audited
in accordance with international standards. Some additional measures have been
proposed to address the remaining risks related to CBS governance and internal audit.
IX. Exchange Rate Arrangement:
The exchange market was liberalized in November 2008 and resulted in elimination of
all the restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions that are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII Sections 2, 3, and 4.
The exchange rate policy is floating. On Nov 22, 2010, US$ 1 = SR 12.26 (mid rate).
X. Article IV Consultations:
Seychelles is currently under a 24 month consultation cycle.

SEYCHELLES: RELATIONS WITH THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK GROUP
(As of October 31, 2010)
The African Development Bank Group commenced operations with the Republic of Seychelles
in 1978 and has since approved 24 operations comprising 15 projects, five studies, three lines of
credit and one emergency assistance operation. There were no approvals between February 2000
and November 2006 when the country was under sanctions, except for an emergency assistance
grant worth US$500,000 to deal with the Tsunami disaster in January 2005. Cumulative
approvals as of October 2010 amounted to UA 86.89 million,25 of which 72 percent was from the
African Development Bank (ADB), 14 percent from the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF), and the
remaining 14 percent from the African Development Fund (ADF) and Technical Assistance
Funds (Table 1). Reflecting Government priorities, most of the operations were in the social
sector (34 percent), followed by multi-sector (23 percent), transport (13 percent), agricultural
(12 percent), water supply and sanitation (11 percent) and the financial sector (8 percent).
The country was under sanctions with the African Development Bank Group since February 16,
2000 due to the arrears situation. The country cleared all the arrears (amounting to
US$46.75 million) in November 2006 and the African Development Bank Group consequently
lifted all sanctions and started discussions on possible reengagement with the country. The
process was boosted by the launching of a comprehensive reform program by the Government
in November 2008. Following this, an Interim Strategy Note was approved by the Board on
April 22, 2009. The ISN covers 2009 and 2010 and focuses on a single pillar namely supporting
the Government‘s reform program to achieve sustainable growth.
The lending program during this period consists of a policy-based operation in the form of a
budget support loan amounting to €15 million, to be disbursed in two equal tranches of
€7.5 million in 2009 and 2010. The operation was approved in July 2009 and the first tranche
was disbursed in November 2009 while the second and final tranche is expected to be disbursed
in the fourth quarter of 2010 pending fulfillment of one outstanding condition, namely the
revision of the Investment Code. In addition, there is an ongoing non-lending program under
which the Bank Group is providing grant resources to the country, from the African Water
Facility and the Middle Income Countries‘ (MIC) Technical Assistance Fund to provide
assistance needed to underpin, over the longer term, more substantial engagement. Under the African
Water Facility, a grant amounting to € 955,000 was signed in May 2008 to finance the
preparation of the Water Development Plan aimed at improved water management and
governance, and identifying priority investment projects for funding, in order to meet
Seychelles‘ water needs up to 2030. The study is expected to be completed by the first quarter of
2011. Under the MIC Technical Assistance Fund three grants have been approved. A grant to
finance a study (amounting to UA 600,000) was approved in December 2008 aimed mainly to
support human resource development, training and capacity building as well as the
establishment of the Seychelles University Foundation. However, the study did not take off as
25

UA 1 = US$ 1.55619 as at October 31, 2010.

9
planned, mainly due to the inability of the Seychelles University Foundation to carry out the
proposed activities and is due for cancellation. A second grant (amounting to US$ 500,000) was
approved in February 2009 to undertake the feasibility on a Submarine Cable System to link
Seychelles to East Africa. It has already been completed while a third grant focusing on the
Development of a Mariculture Master Plan (amounting to UA 280,000) was approved in July
2010.
The Bank approved an unprecedented policy-based partial guarantee operation for US$10 million on December 12, 2009 in support of an exchange bond offered to external commercial
creditors in the context of the public debt restructuring effort. The guarantee was instrumental in
generating a high participation in the debt exchange offer.

An assessment of the ISN has been undertaken through the formulation of a Completion Report that is
due to be presented to the Board in December 2010. The overall finding is that the Strategy has been
relevant and considerable progress has been made in the outputs and outcomes under the single pillar.
Going forward, the major lessons that will need to be taken into account when preparing the next strategy
(scheduled in 2011) are to maintain:(i) a candid dialogue with Government to ensure strategic
responsiveness and flexibility; (ii) close cooperation and coordination with other Development Partners;
and (iii) close supervision and follow-up of all operations (regardless of size) to ensure that
weaknesses/delays are identified and addressed when they arise.

SEYCHELLES: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision has some shortcomings, but it is broadly adequate for surveillance. The country
participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since December 2006 and in
government finance statistics modules of the Anglophone Africa project funded by the U.K.
Department for International Development (DFID). Good progress has been achieved in
improving statistical capacity, but sustained technical assistance and additional resources will be
required for statistical development over the medium term in order to improve the quality of
economic statistics. Ten out of the seventeen applicable data categories of Special Data
Dissemination System (SDDS) meet the coverage, periodicity and timeliness prescriptions of
SDDS.
Real Sector Statistics
National accounts data are prepared on a calendar-year basis with 2006 serving as the base year
for constant price measures. In May 2010, the National Statistics Bureau (NSB) published new
provisional national accounts estimates for 2004-2009. There are considerable delays in
compiling and disseminating volume measures of GDP. The NSB has recently started to compile
quarterly national accounts data for the period 2004-2008, but these were not disseminated,
further work is underway. Tourism statistics are compiled on a weekly and monthly basis.
Production indicators are compiled quarterly, and both are reported to the IMF in a timely
manner. Data on average earnings and employment by sector are collected on a quarterly basis
by the NSB, but there are no data on unit labor costs. A new consumer price index (CPI) was
introduced from October 2007. It utilizes expenditure weights derived from the household
budget survey of 2006- 2007. The base period is July 2007. CPI meets all the SDDS
requirements. The Producer Price Index is not yet compiled in Seychelles.
Government Finance Statistics
General government operations data meet all the SDDS requirements. Government finance
statistics are recorded on a cash basis broadly consistent with the Government Finance Statistics
Manual (1986). The authorities have participated in a GFS pilot study that presented government
finance statistics in the GFSM 2001 analytic framework and are currently participating in a DFID
financed technical assistance project.
The project – as a follow-up to the pilot study – aims at improving the cash-based statistics for
operational and reporting purposes while also laying the foundations for the implementation of
accrual-based measures of fiscal performance and extending the institutional coverage to include
nonfinancial public corporations. Annual data on consolidated central government transactions
are reported for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY). The
authorities have recently prepared 11 cash data on central government budgetary operations for
publication in the IFS using the GFSM 2001 Statement of Sources and Uses of Cash. Since April
2010, the authorities are presenting fiscal reports on a consolidated government basis, and further
to an extensive reclassification of budget dependent entities, the 2001 Budget will be presented
on a general government basis.

11
Monetary and Financial Statistics
Monetary and financial sector data meet SDDS requirements and are reported regularly to STA
for publication in the IFS. The analytical framework underlying the compilation of monetary
statistics is generally sound. An integrated monetary database has been developed and is fully
operational using the standardized report forms (SRF) for reporting monetary data to the Fund.
The SRF-based monetary data have been published in the IFS Supplement since its March 2007
issue.
External Sector Statistics
The authorities have made substantial progress in adopting the methodology of the fifth edition
of the Balance of Payments Manual. Annual balance of payments data are reported to the
Statistics and African Departments nine months after the reference period, but provisional
estimates are provided to missions earlier. Quarterly BOP data are being compiled including
2009, and are now publicly available . Merchandise trade data are reported on a quarterly basis,
and meet SDDS requirements. Since the hiring of financial advisors, considerable progress has
been made recently in collecting and updating data on public sector external debt and debtservice and external payments arrears.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 22, 2010

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with the
Seychelles
On December 20, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the 2010 Article IV consultation with the Seychelles.26
Background
The economic outlook is favorable. Developments in 2010 confirm a quick progress toward
stabilization and have freed up some margins for more expansionary policies. The exchange
rate has stabilized, price stability has been restored and reserves rebuilt. The medium-term
outlook is favorable as growth is projected to gradually reach 5 percent, but the timid global

26

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with

members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
recovery and large external vulnerabilities plead in favor of rebuilding policy buffers and
diversifying the economy.
The 2010 Article IV discussions focused on the medium-term challenges that confront
Seychelles, including recovering from a severe external debt crisis, reducing the small island
state’s vulnerability to external shocks, and promoting private-sector led growth. Several
interrelated issues were discussed: the use of the fiscal margins that have emerged from the
economic recovery, external stability issues, the management of the growing banking liquidity,
and the sound development of the financial sector.
The program is on track. All performance criteria through end-September 2010 were met and
the end-year targets are within reach. Although most of the structural reform agenda is
progressing as scheduled, capacity bottlenecks have delayed two measures that were
structural benchmarks for end-September and end-November 2010 respectively.
The program targets for 2011 reflect further efforts to consolidate economic stabilization gains
and secure Seychelles’s medium-term growth objective. The program accommodates an
easing of the fiscal stance consistent with debt sustainability and external stability. After two
years of fiscal over-performance, the authorities target a primary surplus of 5 percent of GDP
for the 2011 budget, 1 percentage point of GDP less than initially planned. This will provide
fiscal space for the financing of infrastructure, addressing the main growth bottleneck in the
medium term, while maintaining public debt on the initial declining path. Further steps are
taken to rationalize the tax system, including preparations for the launching of a value-added
tax (VAT) in mid-2012. Monetary policy will aim toward maintaining inflation below 3 percent.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the authorities’ stabilization efforts that helped Seychelles overcome
the 2008 balance of payments and debt crisis and the recent global recession. Directors noted
a remarkable turnaround of economic policies, including foreign exchange market liberalization
and floating of the rupee, exceptional fiscal adjustment, and enhanced management of public
finances and the central bank. They also noted the important role played by international

3
assistance, which facilitated successful restructuring of external debt and the return of investor
confidence.
Directors agreed that, with improved economic fundamentals, the medium-term outlook is
positive, but risks remain. They observed that upbeat growth projections, a benign inflationary
environment, and the strong revenue performance in 2010 offer room for more expansionary
fiscal policies in 2011 in support of the country’s development needs, including priority
recruitment in the public sector and infrastructure investment. At the same time, uncertainty
about the global economy and large external vulnerabilities favor the rebuilding of policy
buffers. Directors welcomed further steps to rationalize the tax system, including the launch of
a value-added tax in mid-2012, enhanced transparency and accountability of public finances,
and the planned reform of the social security system.
Directors took note of the staff’s assessment that the exchange rate is broadly in line with
fundamentals, and welcomed the authorities’ intention to maintain a flexible exchange regime,
which has played an important role on the recovery path. However, vigilance is needed against
the inflation and exchange rate risks stemming from excess liquidity in banks, which is
emerging from the quick reduction of domestic public debt. In this context, Directors welcomed
the authorities’ commitment to mop-up liquidity, including by issuing treasury bills for monetary
policy purposes, and to maintain inflation in the low single digits.
Directors noted the soundness of the banking system and welcomed improvements in financial
regulations. At the same time, they thought that greater competition among banks would
facilitate credit growth and intermediation. They encouraged the authorities to reduce state
intervention in the financial system, and enhance disclosure requirements and consumer
protection.
Directors commended the authorities for successful implementation and strong ownership of
the reform program, and were encouraged by their commitment to sustain the reform
momentum. They stressed the need to address capacity bottlenecks, which have delayed two
structural benchmarks.

4
Directors emphasized the need to maintain an ambitious path toward debt sustainability. They
welcomed the measures aimed at enhancing efficiency of public enterprises, underscoring the
importance of ensuring financial sustainability of the national airline and Public Utilities
Company.

IMF Completes Second Review and Financing Assurances Review Under the Extended
Arrangement for Seychelles and Approves US$2.7 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the second
program review and financing assurances review under Seychelles‘ program supported by a
three-year extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF). The completion
of the second review allows the immediate disbursement of an amount equivalent to
SDR 1.76 million (about US$2.7 million), bringing total disbursements under the arrangement
to an amount equivalent to SDR 9.24 million (about US$14.2 million).
The Extended Arrangement for Seychelles became effective on December 23, 2009 in the
amount of SDR 19.8 million (about US$30.3 million, or 225 percent of Seychelles‘ quota in the
Fund (see Press Release No. 09/472).
Following the Executive Board‘s discussion on December 20, 2010, Mr. Naoyuki Shinohara,
Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, made the following statement:
―The Seychellois authorities‘ strong stabilization efforts have helped the economy overcome the
2008 balance of payments and debt crisis and the recent global recession. This was achieved
through a remarkable turnaround of economic policies, including foreign exchange market
liberalization and floating of the rupee, exceptional fiscal adjustment, enhanced management of
public finances and the central bank, and successful external debt restructuring, now close to
completion.
―With the economy rapidly recovering on the back of a rebound in tourism and higher foreign
direct investment, strong revenue performance in 2010 offers fiscal room to support the
country‘s development needs, including priority recruitment in the public sector and
infrastructure investment in 2011, while maintaining an ambitious path toward debt
sustainability.
―Sustained private sector-led economic growth will also require further modernization of public
finances. The ongoing rationalization of the tax system, including preparations for the launch of

2
a value-added tax in mid-2012, and measures to improve transparency and efficiency of the
budget are important steps in this direction.
―Measures by the authorities to enhance the efficiency of state-owned enterprises are crucial for
improving the growth prospects. Further efforts should focus on strengthening the governance
and financial viability of the national airline and the public utility company.
―The authorities‘ intention to maintain a flexible exchange rate regime is welcome, and vigilance
is needed against the inflation and exchange rate risks stemming from excess liquidity in banks,
which is emerging from the reduction of domestic public debt. The programmed monetary
tightening and the authorities‘ commitment to mop-up liquidity are appropriate responses.
―While the banking system appears healthy, efforts to promote competition among banks, reduce
state intervention in the financial system, and enhance disclosure requirements and consumer
protection will promote credit growth and intermediation.‖

Statement by Christopher Legg, Executive Director for Seychelles
and Susan Bultitude, Advisor to the Executive Director
December 20, 2010
Our Seychellois authorities have achieved a remarkable turnaround in the economy and public
finances since the 2008 Article IV consultation. Their ambitious economic reform delivered the
country from a severe balance of payments and debt crisis, brought on by the intersection of
global crises with a legacy of an unsustainable development model. The authorities have also
made considerable progress with a second phase of reforms, directed at consolidating stability,
achieving external debt sustainability and supporting growth.
The three-year EFF that commenced in December 2009 continues to provide a solid foundation
for this medium-term agenda. It is providing a framework to guide policymakers and maintain
the impetus for reform now that the initial crisis has passed, including through Presidential and
Parliamentary elections. It is also helping to coordinate the assistance of donors and other
stakeholders. The program is on track, with growth and the budget surplus exceeding targets in
2010, and the recovery is expected to continue in 2011 and 2012. Key structural reforms for
2011 and 2012 will further enhance public financial management, improve the efficiency and
accountability of public enterprises, and improve the sustainability of public finances. In
pursuing its reforms, the authorities continue to assimilate and adopt a large proportion of advice
from the Fund and other advisers.
Economic developments and outlook
The Seychelles economy exceeded expectations over 2010. The real GDP forecast has been
revised upwards from 4 percent to more than 6 percent, driven by higher than expected activity
in the tourism, construction and manufacturing sectors. Inflation, which had peaked at over
60 percent at the height of the 2008 crisis, was virtually flat, allowing an easing of monetary
policy. The outlook is for continued recovery over the medium term, albeit at a slower rate than
2010.
The authorities are taking steps to mitigate downside risks to the outlook. They are diversifying
export markets, securing goods exports by participating in international efforts to counter piracy,
and investing in public infrastructure to prevent growth bottlenecks.
Program implementation
Our Seychellois authorities have maintained their exemplary program performance, comfortably
meeting all quantitative targets and broadly meeting the structural benchmarks. Two structural
benchmarks were behind schedule at the time of the Staff mission, reflecting capacity constraints
within the public service. One of these has since been met, with the submission of the new
customs management act to the National Assembly on December 14. The authorities remain
committed to implementing the other outstanding benchmark, the adoption of a new chart of
accounts, which has been delayed until the 2012 Budget context as more extensive preparatory
work is required.

Fiscal policy
Stronger than expected revenues in 2010 enabled the Government to exceed its primary surplus
target by 2.4 percent of GDP, while increasing spending for priority areas such as infrastructure,
education and health. This strong fiscal performance, combined with better than expected
progress on debt rescheduling, has provided space for the authorities to build the capacity of the
public service and address infrastructure bottlenecks. Capital expenditures over 2011 will include
a new coast guard facility, a new landfill, improvements to electricity and water distribution
networks, rehabilitation of the Victoria hospital and education facilities, and a new housing
project.
Going forward, the Government will continue to deliver the budget surpluses required to ensure
medium-term debt sustainability, while accommodating pro-growth investment.
Monetary and exchange rate policies
The authorities continue to invest in the Central Bank of Seychelles‘ (CBS‘s) capacity to
undertake effective monetary policy, such as through capital injections of almost SR 190 million
in 2010, the implementation of an integrated (core) banking system on 1 December 2010 and the
expected introduction of a formal risk management framework in 2011. CBS is also increasing
its range of monetary instruments to give greater flexibility in its market interventions.
The recent strong fiscal surpluses have created challenges for monetary policy, with banks‘
excess reserves rising to about 4 percent of GDP as the Government retired debt. The CBS and
Ministry of Finance are working closely together to ensure that the Government‘s debt reduction
efforts do not compromise the effectiveness of monetary transmission or the development of the
financial system. As an interim measure, the authorities will transfer SR 200 million of Social
Security Fund deposits from commercial banks to the CBS for at least one year, while it reviews
the investment strategy for these assets. In addition, the Ministry of Finance is prepared to issue
up to SR 250 million of T-bills for monetary policy purposes, to help the CBS absorb some
excess liquidity. Over the longer-term, continued credit growth and a reduction in lending rates
will help to offset the overhang.
Our Seychellois authorities remain committed to a floating exchange rate, which has served their
economy well through its reforms, despite the volatility that followed the float. The CBS is
implementing measures to improve the efficiency of the inter-bank foreign exchange market,
such as a code of conduct to guide market participants.
Financial sector policies
Seychelles‘ banks are well-capitalised and profitable, and the Fund‘s stress tests indicate that
they are well-positioned to withstand significant shocks. The authorities have made substantial
progress towards implementing a modern, risk-based supervisory framework. They have also
doubled minimum capital requirements and prepared protocols for managing a financial sector
crisis. The CBS will continue to strengthen supervision of financial institutions in accordance
with the new regulations on capital adequacy and credit adopted in November 2010.

3
The authorities are keenly aware that banks‘ high margins and ample liquidity are likely to
reflect the financial sector‘s lack of development, which may unduly restrict credit flows.
Private sector credit grew by 8 per cent over the year to September 2010, off a low base and well
below the growth in broad money. To nurture competitive forces, the authorities are promoting
improved transparency and information dissemination. The CBS is also carrying out a study to
identify uncompetitive practices and barriers, and policies to address them.
Debt restructuring and sustainability
The Government of Seychelles has made remarkable progress in restructuring its debt facilities,
with around US$631 million, or around 91 percent of eligible debt, restructured to date. Around
US$310 million in principal, interest and other charges have been cancelled, and the remainder
has been rescheduled at concessional rates for periods of 17 years or more. Bilateral debt
agreements have been signed with most Paris Club creditors, several non-Paris Club creditors
and all commercial banks, and the Government continues to negotiate in good faith with
remaining creditors.
Reflecting these negotiations, external debt is expected to decline to 45 percent of GDP by the
end of 2010, down from 92 percent at end-2009. The Government remains on track to limit total
public debt (external and domestic) to less than 50 percent of GDP by 2018. This takes into
account an upward revision to debt limits for 2011 to accommodate infrastructure financing,
including concessional loans for electricity and water projects, and a guarantee in support of the
installation of submarine cable for high-speed internet connections.
Structural reforms
The following are key areas of structural reforms that will be pursued over the remaining two
years of the EFF, as Seychelles continues its transition to a modern market-based economy:


Taxation. The Government delivered significant tax reform in 2010, broadening the base
of business and personal income taxes and eliminating exemptions and sectoral
preferences. The final major tax reform will be the introduction of the Value Added Tax in
July 2012. The Government is also pursuing improved tax administration.



Pension Fund and Social Security Fund. An increase in pension contributions from
1 January 2011 is a first step towards a more sustainable Pension Fund. Going forward, the
authorities will launch a strategic plan for the funding structure of the social security
system by June 2011, using the recommendations of a recent World Bank report. A policy
will be formulated outlining the investment objectives of Social Security Fund assets by
September 2011.



Public financial management. The authorities will amend the Public Finance Bill to
reflect recent improvements in budget processes in the legal framework, and to extend the
National Assembly‘s oversight of the capital expenditure budget. An assessment of the
Government‘s financial operations under the EU‘s Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) standards is scheduled for 2011.

4


State-owned enterprises. The Public Enterprise Monitoring and Control Act introduced in
late 2009 and the recently implemented Budget Reclassification policy have facilitated
greater transparency in the operation of state-owned enterprises. The Government has also
established the postal service as an independent commercial entity and undertaken a
strategic assessment of the national airline. Going forward, the Government will develop a
privatization plan for non-strategic public enterprises which do not serve public policy
goals by the end of September 2011. It will also undertake a study of utility tariffs, with the
objective establishing a tariff structure that covers costs and investment needs.



Public financial institutions. The Government has committed to privatizing Nouvobank
and will formulate a privatization strategy by July 2011, based on the findings of
impending technical assistance from the IFC. The authorities are also using the recent
strategic assessments of the Housing Finance Corporation and Development Bank of
Seychelles under the FIRST initiative to inform decisions about the future of these
institutions, and will submit to Cabinet an action plan that limits the role of the public
sector in housing finance, by June 2011.



Trade policy. Seychelles already operates a liberal foreign trade policy, with more than
94 percent of all tariff lines set at zero. Nonetheless, the authorities have begun
modernizing the trade regime, are pursuing trade negotiations with the European Union,
and have committed to WTO accession.
