KEY ISSUES
Context. Guatemala’s economy has performed solidly since the 2008–09 crisis. Output has
converged to potential, inflation is under control, and macroeconomic policies remain
prudent. However, risks to the outlook are tilted downwards, while buffers are modest and
space for counter-cyclical policies is thin. Long-term inclusive growth is constrained by low
investment in physical and human capital, institutional weaknesses, and lack of security.
Near-term policies are broadly appropriate. With the output gap closed, the broadly
neutral fiscal stance is adequate. The monetary stance is slightly expansionary, but inflation is
at the bottom of the target range. The authorities should stand ready to tighten monetary
policy if inflationary pressures re-emerge.
Fiscal sustainability should be enhanced over the medium term. Though the debt-toGDP ratio remains moderate, the ability to implement counter-cyclical fiscal policies is
limited, not least by Guatemala’s high government debt-to-revenue ratio. Debt stabilization
requires moderate tightening of the budgetary stance over the medium term. The emphasis
should be on revenue mobilization, given the overall low level of spending. Consolidating
gains from the 2012 tax reform, which has so far proved disappointing, will be critical.
Efforts to upgrade the monetary and exchange policy framework should continue.
Anchoring low and stable inflation will require measures to bolster monetary policy
transmission, including by expanding exchange rate flexibility. This should provide an
additional shock absorber and reduce incentives for dollarization. It would also establish the
inflation target as the undisputed primary objective of the central bank.
Further strengthening of the financial system is necessary. The 2014 FSAP update found
that Guatemala has made significant progress in financial regulation and that the banking
system appears to be generally sound. However, efforts are still needed to improve
consolidated supervision and the regulation of off-shore banks. The time is also ripe for a
phased move to Basel III standards.
Structural reforms are vital to achieving long-term inclusive growth. Paving the way
towards high, inclusive growth will depend upon raising the low tax-to-GDP ratio to support
priority public spending, thereby addressing critical social and developmental needs.

OVERVIEW
1.
The Guatemalan economy continues its solid expansion. After emerging from the
global financial crisis, activity rebounded quickly, spurred by domestic demand and supported by
rising world export prices and counter-cyclical policies. Growth has now eased back to potential
and the output gap is closed. Macroeconomic policies have stayed a prudent course, helping to
maintain relatively low inflation. The financial system appears robust and the country’s current
account deficit is stable and fully financed by FDI. The macro outlook is broadly positive.
2.
The main challenge is to unleash higher and more inclusive long-term growth,
while enhancing resilience to shocks and preserving macroeconomic stability. Potential
growth is constrained by weak investment in physical and human capital, and by the elevated
crime and insecurity; poverty is widespread. Increasing high-quality public spending to support
equitable growth is critical, but it will require boosting public revenue and strengthening
expenditure management to safeguard macroeconomic stability. A nimbler handling of shocks
would be allowed by widening the scope for counter-cyclical budget and monetary policies—
fiscal space is currently limited by the very low tax burden, monetary space by downwards-sticky
inflation expectations and dollarization. Upgrading the regulatory and supervisory frameworks,
while monitoring carefully the rapid growth of credit, particularly in foreign currency, are
important to safeguard financial stability.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Growth has returned to potential. Rebounding from the global crisis and natural
disasters in 2010, real GDP surged by 4¼ percent in 2011, helping close the output gap that
opened during 2008–09. Economic expansion decelerated to 3 percent in 2012, but recovered to
3¾ percent in 2013 (around its estimated potential—―Analytical Note I (AN I)), spurred by
healthy private consumption, despite less favorable external conditions and the onset of the
coffee roya disease. Accordingly, activity remains at capacity.

4.
Inflation picked up in 2013, but stayed within the target range, and has declined in
early 2014. In 2012 inflation fell sharply to 3½ percent from 6¼ percent in the previous year, as
commodity prices stabilized and domestic demand pressures weakened. While prices accelerated
in the first half of 2013, mostly owing to fast rising food prices, inflation abated in the second
semester and closed the year at 4.4 percent, within the central bank (CB)’s target range of
4±1 percent. By June 2014, y-o-y inflation was reduced to 3 percent amid deceleration in both
food prices and core inflation.
5.
The balance of payments was stable in 2013. The current account deficit as a share of
GDP was virtually unchanged at 2¾ percent of GDP. The trade balance turned out the same and
a slight deterioration in the balance of services was offset by an improved income balance, amid
continuing robust remittances. The deficit remained comfortably financed by steady FDI and
public sector borrowing, with no significant impact from U.S. monetary policy normalization due
to limited financial integration. Thus, net international reserves (NIR) reached US$6.4 billion at
end-2013, with import cover constant at 3.9 months, providing a comfortable reserve cushion.
External debt stays low compared to peers.

Competitiveness is broadly adequate. The Fund’s multilaterally consistent estimates
under the External Balance Assessment (EBA) methodology as well as CGER and WHD staff’s own
approach imply that Guatemala’s REER is generally in line with medium term fundamentals
(Box 1). The external deficit is mainly explained by Guatemala’s relatively young and growing
population and relatively low income level. An improvement in the external current account
balance over the past decade, despite substantial appreciation of the CPI-based REER during that
period, supports the assessment that the REER is close to equilibrium. However, some signs of
competitiveness strains have emerged (see Box 1).

GUATEMALA

Box 1. Guatemala: External Stability Assessment
Guatemala’s real effective exchange rate (REER) is generally in line with medium-term fundamentals. Staff
used a variety of approaches to assess Guatemala’s external balance and exchange rate, including changes in the
CPI-based real effective exchange rate, regression-based methods to assess the current account balance, and
stability conditions for net foreign assets.
Since 2003, the CPI-based REER has appreciated by about 30 percent but the current account balance has
improved. The substantial real exchange rate appreciation was partially driven by Guatemala’s inflation
differential with its main trading partner (the U.S.). Relative productivity increases in Guatemala may have
alleviated the impact of this appreciation on competitiveness, however, ULC-based REER indicators are not
available. At the same time, the current account deficit improved from 4¾ percent of GDP in 2003 to 2½ percent
of GDP in 2013, largely on account of a stronger trade balance.
The financing structure of the current account deficit, high reserves and low external liabilities mitigate
external risks. Guatemala’s net IIP position is relatively small at negative 20 percent of GDP in 2013 and FDI
comprises about 40 percent of total liabilities. The stock of net international reserves stood at 4.1 months of
imports at end-2013 and is well within the Fund’s composite reserve adequacy metric. Thus, current reserve levels
provide an adequate buffer against potential shocks. At this stage, staff projects little further reserve
accumulation in line with the authorities' intention to emphasize greater exchange rate flexibility going forward.
As a result, reserve ratios are expected to fall over time, approaching minimum levels considered appropriate,
particularly when compared to imports. The move toward flexibility is appropriate but the authorities should
remain vigilant to ensure continued reserve adequacy.

Box 1. Guatemala: External Stability Assessment (Continued)
CGER methods based on the equilibrium real effective exchange rate and the PPP, however, would suggest a
substantial overvaluation (between 25 and 40 percent), but are less reliable due to large forecast errors,
thus, staff does not attribute much significance to those estimates.



The WHD staff model is based on a current account regression that is similar to the CGER macrobalance
approach, but includes an additional variable capturing the speed of aging, the youth dependency ratio
instead of population growth, changes in oil price for oil producers instead of the oil balance, and a measure
of trade openness. This approach suggests slight undervaluation of about 3¾ percent.

A simple average across the different reliable methodologies implies a slight undervaluation of 2¾ percent and,
given model uncertainty and standard errors, the conclusion is that Guatemala’s REER is broadly in line with
fundamentals.

7.
The results of the 2012 tax reform have been disappointing. The package broadened
the base of the corporate and personal income taxes, eliminated several VAT exemptions,
increased vehicle taxes, and streamlined customs duties. The measures aimed to raise revenues
by 1–1½ percent of GDP over the course of 2013 and 2014. The reform faced many obstacles,
including numerous claims before the Constitutional Court, reflecting the long-standing
reluctance by influential sectors to accept a higher tax burden. So far these challenges have been
largely unsuccessful, though associated uncertainties have weighed down on collections.
Moreover, the tax administration has been plagued with implementation and governance
problems. As a result, thus far, the reform has yielded only around ¼ percent of GDP in extra
collections. Even these meager gains are outweighed by shortfalls not related to the reform,
mainly on international trade taxes, owing to administrative shortcomings at the customs agency.
8.
Notwithstanding the revenue shortfall, the fiscal deficit declined in 2013 and
remained well below planned levels, amid financing constraints. Expenditures were
constrained by delays in congressional approval of IFI loans owing to political wrangling within
the fragmented legislature in which the government lacks a secure majority. With underspending exceeding collection losses, the overall deficit (slightly above 2 percent of GDP) fell
below the budget target (2½ percent of GDP). The narrower deficit implied a mildly
contractionary fiscal stance and maintained public debt nearly constant and low as a share of
GDP. However, public debt is high in relation to fiscal revenue when compared to regional peers.

Monetary policy has been slightly relaxed and FX intervention has remained low.
The CB lifted the policy rate by 25 bps to 5.25 percent in April 2013 to stem incipient signs of
inflationary pressures. Amid private sector concerns for growth, this increase was reversed in
November 2013, and the rate was reduced by additional 50 bps to 4.5 percent in the first half of
2014, in the wake of declining inflation. The exchange rate (XR) has remained broadly stable, with
minimal CB net cumulative FX purchases under its rules-based intervention framework
(Figure 2)—in early 2014, the authorities increased the XR fluctuation margin for intervention
from 0.65 to 0.7 percent of the five-day moving average of the XR.

has risen (albeit from low levels), and maternal mortality has fallen. However, a third of the
population is below the minimum dietary energy consumption, and chronic malnutrition of
children younger than 5 years is pervasive at about 50 percent. At the same time, the level of
informality remains very high, while security concerns are very serious.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
12.
The authorities agreed that the macroeconomic outlook remains benign. Growth is
expected to return to its trend rate of 3½ percent into the medium term, supported by ongoing
buoyant domestic demand and private sector credit, while inflation converges toward the center
of the CB’s target range. The external current account deficit, largely financed by FDI, stays
around 2½ percent of GDP until 2019, underpinned by robust export prices. This baseline
scenario envisages a broadly neutral budget stance in 2014 and modest fiscal expansion through
the 2015 election cycle, with measured consolidation thereafter. By 2019, the central government
(CG) deficit is projected to stabilize at 2 percent of GDP with gross financing needs hovering
around 3–3½ percent of GDP in the next five years—among the lowest in the region—and public
debt rising slowly to around 27 percent of GDP.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF

staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability
below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the
source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize



External conditions. Risks related to the normalization of monetary policy in the U.S. are
balanced. If U.S. growth accelerates faster than expected, the positive spillover effects—
U.S. is the destination of 40 percent of Guatemalan exports and primary source of
remittances—could spur growth in Guatemala and more than offset tighter global
financial conditions in the short run, if exit is orderly (AN III). However, extreme bouts of
volatility could inflict serious damage. Moreover, global risk realignment and intensified
inflationary pressures from faster U.S. growth may push up interest rates in Guatemala
more than anticipated, putting brakes on investment and growth. In addition, deeperthan-expected slowdowns in emerging markets, less favorable-than anticipateddevelopments in Europe, and disruptions in commodity markets due to geopolitical
tensions could also hamper Guatemalan growth. The effects of global factors may be
amplified by Guatemala’s strong linkages with other economies in the region (AN II).



Domestic risks. The continued lags in implementing the 2012 tax reform and the
political impasse on the 2014 budget may endanger much needed government
programs. On the other hand, if lower revenues were not to be met with spending cuts,
the fiscal trajectory could be derailed, aggravating debt dynamics, and lowering
Guatemala’s resilience to shocks.

14.
Longer-term risks are also tilted downwards. On the domestic front, insufficient
revenue mobilization could persist, deterring investment in physical and human capital. In turn,
this could significantly weigh on the country’s growth and social prospects in the long run. A
further deterioration of the security situation could also put a drag on economic expansion.

raise productivity, as well as institutional reform and improvements to the security situation.

11

GUATEMALA

A. Near-term Policy Mix
16.
There was agreement that budget policies are adequate in the short run. Owing to
the inability of the politically divided Congress to pass a budget for 2014, the nominal
expenditure and financing ceilings of the 2013 budget were carried over into 2014. Congress also
increased the 2013 spending limit by ¼ percent of GDP for health and education. Consequently,
it is now anticipated that the headline CG deficit will hold steady at just above 2 percent of GDP
in 2014. These estimates are predicated on a modest improvement in revenue collections,
execution of the 2014 budget based on a “continuing resolution” of the 2013 budget, and
parliamentary approval of planned IFI disbursements. This implies a broadly neutral fiscal stance,
which, with output staying at potential, was deemed appropriate by both authorities and staff.
17.
The authorities reiterated their resolve to implement fully the tax reform. With
elections in 2015, it was recognized that congressional approval for additional revenue measures
is unlikely. Therefore, virtually the only prospect for increasing collections in the short term lies in
settling the court challenges and addressing the implementation setbacks of the 2012 reform.
The authorities concurred that this will require efforts to resolve ongoing administrative
problems, notably in the customs agency.
18.
They also confirmed that any revenue and financing shortfalls will be offset by
spending cuts. Besides the problems with tax collections (¶s7, 16), another threat to spending
implementation is approval of IFI loans. In this regard, the authorities noted that, in contrast to
2013, when external bonds worth US$700 were sold, in 2014 they have filled entirely with
domestic issuances the total bond ceiling prescribed by the 2013 budget.1 This still leaves a
financing gap of around 1 percent of GDP to be covered by IFI loans or domestic bonds, both of
which must be approved by Congress. The authorities are confident that parliamentary backing
will be forthcoming, though marked delays could force some spending retrenchment. Officials
stressed that Guatemala has a track record of maintaining fiscal balance through expenditure
restrictions. Staff cautioned that, if shortfalls do materialize, the government should refrain from
across-the-board cuts to already low public expenditure and safeguard priority social programs
and investment. In addition, improvements to public financial management are needed to avoid
domestic spending arrears. In this connection, staff recommended finalizing a reliable estimate of
their outstanding stock, and establishing a strategy for their clearance.2
19.
The authorities attach great importance to formal adoption of the 2015 budget and
staff anticipates little change in the deficit next year. Officials acknowledged that operating
on a “continuing resolution” basis constrains flexibility of budget execution and a proper 2015
budget would allow for better targeting of outlays on priority programs. At this early stage in the
budget process, a fiscal deficit of about 2½ percent of GDP is envisioned for 2015, though, in
light of likely persisting expenditure under-execution, staff believes it will end up being
somewhat lower (below 2¼ percent of GDP). Staff argued that next year’s budget should include

both the overdue and current refund to the CB to cover its operational losses. Officials
concurred, but noted that the decision is up to Congress. The Central Bank has undertaken legal
actions to require Congress to fulfill its obligations in that regard.
20.
Monetary policy is slightly accommodative, calling for heightened vigilance of
inflation, though the authorities may contemplate further modest loosening. Staff’s analysis
suggests that the monetary policy stance is somewhat expansionary, though still generally
appropriate (AN V). On the one hand, the financial 24

points cuts since the third quarter of 2013. In
addition, bank credit continues to expand quickly and domestic demand will be further boosted
by strong remittance flows. Thus, with the domestic output gap closed, food price increases
starting to accelerate in the region, and increasing risks of an upturn in imported prices, staff
recommended that the authorities should refrain from additional cuts to the policy rate. Indeed,
the CB ought to stand ready to increase the policy rate promptly to better anchor expectations if
signs of an inflation upswing emerge. The authorities affirmed readiness to tighten monetary
policy if needed. Nonetheless, in their view, risks prevailed that inflation could turn out lower
than currently projected through 2015, in which case there could be room for further rate cuts.

B. Increasing Resilience to Shocks
Rebuilding fiscal space and enhancing fiscal sustainability
21.
The authorities recognized that continuing increases in public debt are a source of
vulnerability, while stressing that risks are not immediate. Staff projections show
government debt as a share of GDP increasing into the medium term, though slowly, even at the
current low level of interest rates. Moreover, public debt ratios could resume a faster ascent if the
politically-induced funding problems that have constrained spending since 2013 are resolved.
Staff noted that Guatemala cannot rely comfortably on debt financing for prolonged
expansionary counter-cyclical policies. Funding risks could escalate rapidly, especially in light of
the low government revenues and fairly high debt-to-revenue ratio compared to its peers. And
shallow domestic financial markets (with a highly concentrated investor base and virtually nonexisting secondary government debt market) as well as political rigidities that curtail access to
multilateral lending provide thin coverage against spikes in global risk aversion.

22.
Hence, it was agreed that fiscal sustainability should be gradually bolstered over
the medium term. Stabilizing the debt-to-GDP ratio at its current level—thereby unlocking the
ability to implement expansionary counter-cyclical policies without exacerbating budget funding
risks—would require a permanent improvement in the primary balance of about ½ percent of
GDP (AN IV). If the actuarial deficit of the social security system were taken into account, the
sustainability gap would be correspondingly larger. With no pressing cyclical need for cooling off
measures, domination of downside risks to growth, and estimated fiscal multipliers of about 0.4
on average (with activity at potential, multipliers tend to be lower), staff advised a moderately
paced adjustment beginning in 2015–16 with modest frontloading and spaced over several years,
that would strike the right balance between reducing the sustainability gap and limiting the
negative impact on growth. This conclusion is supported also by the positive impact from faster
growth in the U.S. and minimal spillovers from fiscal policy tightening in trading partners (AN II).
The authorities reiterated their intention to reflect medium-term consolidation requirements,
already included in the 2013 medium-term budget, in the formulation of the 2015 budget.
23.
The authorities favored additional efforts to mobilize revenue beyond budget
consolidation needs. Guatemala needs not only to achieve long-term fiscal sustainability, but
also to maintain macro stability while addressing pressing social needs and paving the way
toward high, inclusive long-term growth. Meeting these objectives will depend upon raising the
currently low level of government revenues to support priority public spending. In particular,
staff counseled reducing tax expenditures (equivalent to about 8 percent of GDP), and realigning
VAT rates (from 12 to 14 percent) with those prevailing in the region. Lowering the currently high
degree of revenue earmarking (about 50 percent) will also be important to widen the fiscal
adjustment toolbox. In this regard, staff cautioned that tax exemptions and other special
treatments included in the draft competitiveness law currently under consideration by congress
could threaten fiscal revenue. Weaknesses in tax administration accentuate this concern.

Staff stressed that a key element of such a reform
would be a requirement for Congress to approve all government financing—including external
loans—as part of any overall budget package.

Strengthening the financial system and setting the basis for its orderly deepening
25.
The authorities concurred that monetary policy transmission should be reinforced
to anchor further low and stable inflation. The transmission channels of monetary policy
remain feeble, while pass-through effects from commodity prices continue to influence inflation
heavily. Staff identified a four-pronged approach for enhancing monetary policy transmission.
First, it is desirable to continue raising gradually XR flexibility, credibly conveying to the public
that the inflation target is the monetary authorities’ primary objective. In this regard,
consolidating the operational independence of the CB from government and private sector
interests would be important. Second, efforts ought to be stepped up to de-dollarize credit,
mainly by allowing the XR to fluctuate and thereby forcing agents to internalize FX risks and
promote hedging. Additional prudential measures for dollar credit could also be adopted (¶26).
Third, public debt and private securities markets need to be developed. To this end, it is also
important to finalize the draft capital markets law in compliance with IOSCO best practices and

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GUATEMALA

enact it. Finally, the framework for monetary operations—including with technical assistance
from the Fund—should be further refined. The authorities broadly endorsed this advice, though
emphasizing that the rule-based FX intervention allows for significant XR flexibility over time and
CB intervention has been minimal. Staff observed that the regime introduced in 2005 has not
been seriously tested so far and the risk exists that, if strong pressures for depreciation arose,
serious loss of reserves might occur.
26.
Officials saw private credit growth as generally appropriate, but acknowledged the
need for greater vigilance. It was recognized that credit expansion has recently moderated, but
that the slant of new loans toward foreign currency warrants caution, especially given the
growing reliance on external credit lines. Moreover, while there is no immediate cause for
concern, continuation over a long period of high rates of credit expansion could eventually
undermine stability of the financial system. At the same time, it was noted that Guatemala’s
financial system is shallow and financial deepening will require moderate but sustained credit
growth over that of nominal GDP. Staff advised that macro-prudential measures be considered,
notably higher reserve requirements for dollar-denominated deposits, higher capital
requirements for FX loans to non-exporters, and the prohibition of FX mortgage and consumer
credit, particularly should evidence emerge of deterioration in the loan portfolio. Staff also
recommended that extension of the loan register system to non-bank lenders would improve
monitoring of household leverage.
27.
There was agreement that efforts to buttress regulation and supervision of the
financial system should progress further. Consistent with the findings of the 2014 FSAP
update, staff highlighted that significant reforms have been undertaken in response to the
previous FSAP in 2006, but stressed that urgent efforts are still needed. In particular, the danger
of overestimating capital levels always exists. This could be exacerbated by flaws in consolidated
supervision—including lack of a definition of economic group for supervisory purposes—,
insufficient supervision of financial entities that pose material risks to the conglomerate, and lax
definitions of related parties and controlling interests. Moreover, the special nature of off-shore
banks (operating in Guatemala but incorporated in other countries) still poses systemic risks. In
light of comfortable core tier 1 capital levels in the banking sector, its high profitability, and
excess systemic and individual liquidity levels, staff indicated that the time is appropriate to
require higher capital and liquidity buffers to raise resilience to adverse shocks. In this regard, a
phased move to Basel III standards appears the right course of action. Filling in data gaps and
adopting robust methodologies for financial stability analysis should be a policy priority. Finally,
further strengthening on the anti-money laundering (AML) framework would assist the
authorities in their efforts to address financial crimes and corruption.
28.
The authorities also concurred that rising financial interconnectedness presents
opportunities but also risks. Financial systems in CAPDR are becoming increasingly integrated.
Growing economic ties, economies of scale, and regulatory arbitrage provide incentives for the
development of regional financial conglomerates. Guatemala is well involved in this process, with
Guatemalan banks expanding operations in the region and foreign investors, particularly from
Colombia, have taken a larger stake in Guatemalan banks. Ongoing financial integration may
bring important benefits, but it increases contagion concerns in case of a banking crisis. Regional
financial integration also poses challenges for consolidated and transnational supervision of

financial conglomerates with implications for risk management. To capitalize on the
opportunities, officials are taking steps to implement regulation and supervision arrangements
that minimize regulatory gaps, arbitrage, and cross-border contagion.

STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
The Guatemalan economy is broadly sound and the macro outlook largely positive.
Emerging from the 2008–09 global financial crisis, activity rebounded quickly. Growth has now
eased back to potential, the output gap is closed, and inflation is contained. The financial system
appears robust and the current account deficit is stable, supported by a steady trade balance and
remittance flows, and largely financed by FDI. Growth is expected to remain generally in line with
its trend rate, supported by buoyant domestic demand, while inflation converges toward the
center of the target range. However, risks are tilted to the downside, owing both to global
uncertainties and domestic policy constraints.
33.
Short-term fiscal policy is generally appropriate, but consolidation of the tax
reform and adoption of a budget for 2015 are critical. With the output gap essentially closed,
the current broadly neutral budget stance is appropriate. However, efforts to address
implementation setbacks to the 2012 tax reform are urgently needed, notably by strengthening
taxpayer compliance, particularly in customs. Timely approval of multilateral loans this year will
also be important to support effective spending execution. Congressional passage of the 2015
budget will facilitate targeting of outlays.
34.
Monetary policy is mildly expansionary and caution must be exercised for possible
re-emergent inflationary pressures. Headline inflation is currently close to the bottom of the
target range, inflation expectations have lately declined close to the mid-point of the target
range, and core inflation remains low. After recent cuts to the policy rate, the monetary stance is
slightly supportive, though still generally appropriate. Considering that activity is at potential,
pressures on food prices are on the rise in the region, and risks of higher import prices are
growing, there is no room for additional cuts to the policy rate. Indeed, the authorities should
stand ready to increase the rate promptly if signs of an inflation upswing emerge.
35.
Fiscal sustainability should be progressively strengthened over the medium term.
While low as a percentage of GDP, public debt is fairly high as a share of revenue and has been
steadily increasing since the crisis, which may eventually generate vulnerabilities. Therefore, the
debt-to-GDP ratio should be stabilized. This would require a permanent improvement in the
primary balance of about ½ percent of GDP. With no pressing cyclical need for tightening and
risks to growth weighed to the downside, a moderately paced and modestly frontloaded
adjustment beginning in 2015 is recommended.
36.
Revenue mobilization and improvements to public expenditure management must
support budgetary adjustment. Raising revenues is needed not only for achieving long-term
fiscal sustainability and maintaining macro stability, but also for stepping up spending on health,
education, security, and infrastructure, thereby enhancing the growth potential of Guatemala. To
lift collections, it is necessary to improve tax and customs administration, reduce tax
expenditures, and align VAT rates with those prevailing in the region. The draft competitiveness
law should be revised to allay concerns that tax exemptions and other special treatments in the
current proposal could lead to significant revenue losses. Steps are also needed to reinforce
budgetary management and improve the efficiency and flexibility of public expenditure, not least
by reducing revenue earmarking and streamlining the approval of official external financing.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GUATEMALA

37.
Further deepening of monetary policy transmission should be pursued. This
strengthening will enhance the ability of the CB to respond in a timely and effective fashion to
changes in the outlook for inflation and macro conditions more generally. To this end, it would
be desirable to reinforce inflation as the primary objective of monetary policy, including through
a gradual enhancement of XR flexibility that may also help de-dollarize the economy.
Development of domestic securities markets would also be helpful, which requires finalizing the
draft capital markets law in compliance with IOSCO best practices and enacting it. Additionally,
this will facilitate further refinement of monetary operations.
38.
Efforts to bolster regulation and supervision of the financial system must progress
further, while monitoring carefully the strong credit growth. The 2014 FSAP update
identified the need to strengthen consolidated supervision and supervision of financial entities
that pose material risks to conglomerates, as well as to tighten definitions of related parties, in
order to mitigate risks of overestimating capital. Moreover, it would be advisable to step up the
ring-fencing of on-shore banks with respect to the operations of off-shore banks. Solid core
tier 1 capital in the banking system, its high profitability, and excess systemic and individual
liquidity levels indicate that the time is ripe for a gradual introduction of Basel III standards. This
would establish capital and liquidity buffers that raise resilience to adverse shocks. Regional
financial integration highlights the necessity to implement regulatory and supervisory
arrangements that minimize regulatory gaps, arbitrage, and cross-border contagion. Private
credit continues to expand quickly, though its pace has moderated recently, with the slant of new
loans toward foreign currency and consumer financing. A close watch must be kept for signs of
worsening in credit quality. Especially if these materialize, macro-prudential measures, notably
higher capital requirements for FX loans to non-exporters, ought to be considered.
39.
Enhanced social spending, structural reforms, and greater regional integration
would pave the way toward high inclusive long-term growth. Notwithstanding the progress
made toward meeting the Millennium Development Goals targets, poverty remains widespread
and security concerns are very serious. Higher social spending would not only help reduce
poverty, but also build a skilled and productive labor force, thereby fostering competitiveness
and sustaining growth. There is also scope to enhance productivity through structural reforms to
improve the business climate, reduce anti-competitive practices, limit the influence of vested
interests, and combat crime. Greater regional integration through the completion of the customs
union, harmonization of trade rules, and further integration of services and factor markets would
also boost Guatemala’s growth potential.
40.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

1/ Public sector is defined as central government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ EMBI.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock at the end of previous year.

5/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 4 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
8/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar
terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency
(e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of
GDP) remain at their levels of the last projection year.

Safeguards Assessment. Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Bank of Guatemala
was subject to an assessment with respect to the Stand-By Arrangement approved on April 22, 2009
(IMF Country Report No: 09/143). The assessment, which was completed in September 2009, found
that the Bank of Guatemala has strengthened safeguards in the areas of financial reporting
transparency and the management of foreign exchange reserves. Recommendations were made to
further strengthen the bank’s governance and independence.
Exchange Rate Arrangement. Since March 1994, Guatemala has had an arrangement based on an
interbank foreign exchange market in which authorized financial institutions buy and sell foreign
exchange at market-determined rates. Financial institutions authorized to operate in the foreign
exchange market include commercial banks, finance companies, and exchange houses. While
Guatemala has a de jure floating exchange rate arrangement, the de facto arrangement has
classified as “floating”. Guatemala has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4,
and its exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
transactions. As of July 24, 2014 the reference exchange rate was Q7.80 per U.S. dollar.
FSAP Participation. An FSAP was conducted on July 3–7, 2000 and on September 11–23, 2000, and
the Financial System Stability Assessment was discussed by the Executive Board on May 14, 2001 at
the time of the 2001 Article IV consultation. An FSAP Update was undertaken during October 27–
November 10, 2005. An FSAP Update is underway for 2014 and an IMF and a World Bank team
visited Guatemala during March 18-April 1, 2014.
Article IV Consultation. The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on
July 25, 2013.
Resident Representative. Mr. Mario Garza is the Regional Resident Representative for Costa Rica,
Guatemala, and El Salvador, and is based in Guatemala.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK AND BANK-FUND
COLLABORATION UNDER THE JOINT MANAGEMENT ACTION
PLAN (JMAP)
1.

The IMF’s Guatemala team led by Mr. Lorenzo Figliuoli (Mission Chief) has met on
various occasions with the World Bank’s Guatemala team led by Mr. Oscar Calvo-Gonzalez
(Program Leader) to discuss macroeconomic challenges, identify macro-critical structural reforms,
and coordinate the two teams’ work for the period August 2014–July 2015.
2.
The teams agreed that Guatemala’s main macroeconomic challenges are to safeguard
fiscal sustainability, increase the effectiveness of monetary policy, and maintain financial
sector stability.
3.
The teams concurred that Guatemala’s near-term outlook is generally positive, though
there are risks stemming from global uncertainty and the limited scope to adopt
countercyclical policies in case downside risks materialize.
4.
Based on the shared assessment of macroeconomic challenges, the teams have
identified the following structural reform areas as macro-critical:


Fiscal consolidation and revenue strengthening. Guatemala’s fiscal position had deteriorated
in 2009-10 due to a decline in public revenues in the aftermath of the global crisis and an
increase in current expenditures. Significant fiscal adjustment occurred in 2011-12, though
still insufficient to stop the rise in the ratio of public debt to GDP. The 2012 tax reform has
yielded less additional revenue than anticipated due to implementation problems and legal
challenges. Stabilizing public sector debt at current levels will require a fiscal adjustment of
about ¾-1 percent of GDP over the medium term. However, beyond this goal, adopting
additional revenue-enhancing measures and improving the efficiency and composition of
public expenditure will be critical to achieving increases in spending in critical areas (e.g.,
social programs, infrastructure, and security).



Monetary policy framework. Strengthening further the monetary framework, including by
allowing greater exchange rate flexibility, is key to improve the effectiveness of monetary
policy,



Financial sector stability. Guatemala is well placed to apply key Basel III components and is in
compliance with most of the Basel I framework. However, important work remains, including
the full implementation of risk-based supervision and consolidated supervision. Approval of
the law for micro-finance institution, currently under consideration by Congress, and the
securities market law would also add to the system’s resilience.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GUATEMALA

5.

The teams agreed the following division of labor:



Fiscal consolidation and revenue strengthening. The Fund will continue to provide policy
recommendations on macro-fiscal issues, including the overall strategy of fiscal
consolidation. The Fund will continue to provide technical assistance on budgetary
management, which is expected to help strengthen expenditure controls and prevent the
accumulation of new domestic payment arrears. The Bank completed a Public Expenditure
Review in 2013 along with a database on expenditures at the municipal level. In 2014 the
Bank’s Board approved a Development Policy Loan for $340 million which aims at:
(i) strengthening tax administration and tax policy; (ii) enhancing the quality of public
expenditure and; (iii) improving the coordination and management of social policy. This
Development Policy Loan is currently being reviewed by the Guatemalan Congress and is
expected to be approved in 2014.



Monetary policy framework. The Fund will continue to provide policy recommendations and
technical assistance to improve the monetary framework, including regarding exchange rate
flexibility.



Financial sector stability. The Bank and the Fund will cooperate as necessary in assisting
Guatemala to strengthen its financial system. A new FSAP is scheduled for the spring of 2014
and will be undertaken in collaboration by the Fund and the Bank.

6.

The teams have the following requests for information from their counterparts:



The Fund team requests to be kept informed of progress in the above macro-critical
structural reform areas. Timing: when milestones are reached (and at least semi-annually).



The Bank team requests to be kept informed of the Fund’s assessments of macroeconomic
policies and prospects, including updates of the Fund’s macroeconomic framework, and
progress in the above macro-critical structural reform areas.

The attached table lists the teams’ separate and joint work programs during August 2014–July
2015.

RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT
BANK
(As of July, 2014)

D. Recent Projects and Objectives
1.
On December 2012, the IADB approved its country strategy for Guatemala for
2012–2016. It focuses on improving living conditions for the Guatemalan population, particularly
those living in rural areas. The strategy’s priority target areas are structured along two axes, the first
institutional, covering the areas of (i) fiscal and municipal management, (ii) social protection, and
(ii) peaceful coexistence and citizen security; and the second addressing rural development,
including the areas of (iv) productive development, (v) health, and (vi) transportation. Work will also
be done in the crosscutting areas of climate change adaptation and mitigation, natural disaster
impact mitigation, indigenous peoples and gender; and regional integration will be promoted,
particularly in the transportation and energy sectors.
2.
As of July 2014, the IADB portfolio of approved sovereign-guaranteed loans under
execution amounted to US$530.1 million, with an undisbursed balance of US$323.8 million.
3.
The existing sovereign guaranteed portfolio focuses on: (i) education; (ii) water and
sanitation; (iii) health; (iv) competitiveness; (v) modernization of the state; (vi) environment and
natural disasters; (vii) energy and (viii) trade. In the private sector, the IADB has an approved loan of
US$20 million to support SMEs development and competitiveness.
4.
The pipeline for 2014 includes two projects in the public sector for US$310 million: one
related to energy (electrification in rural areas) for US$60 million and a US$250 million Policy-Based
Loan related to improving expenditure efficiency in the health and education sectors. On the private
sector side, the IADB approved in the second semester of 2013 a US$150 million loan to increase the
SME financing in Guatemala, which has already been disbursed.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of April July 31, 2014)
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
National accounts: In 2010, the Bank of Guatemala began publishing quarterly national accounts
statistics consistent with the SNA 1993, with 2001 as the base year.
Consumer prices and unemployment: In 2011, the consumer price index was re-based to
December, 2010, and the index weights were updated to reflect changes in the consumption
basket since the base 2000 index. Unemployment is estimated only on an annual basis.
Government finance statistics: Revenue, expenditure, and financing statistics for social security
agencies, local governments, and nonfinancial public enterprises are not reported, hindering the
calculation of a consolidated operations statement and balance sheet for the nonfinancial public
sector. The coverage and periodicity of data on central government financing and debt is
adequate.
Monetary and financial statistics: The quality, coverage, and periodicity of data for the Bank of
Guatemala and commercial banks are sufficient. Data for the offshore sector and savings
cooperatives is only available quarterly, and with a lag of five weeks.
External sector statistics: The Bank of Guatemala publishes quarterly balance of payments data
according to the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. In 2012, the Bank of Guatemala
increased the periodicity of publication of international investment position data from annual to
quarterly. Detail on private sector external debt by creditor and by maturity structure is not
available.
Data Standards and Quality
Guatemala became a participant in the General
Data Dissemination System in 2004. Several
data categories are yet to meet the periodicity
or timeliness requirements necessary for
subscription to the Special Data Dissemination
Standard.

A data ROSC was completed on October 28,
2004.

PAST FUND STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS AND
IMPLEMENTATION
2013 Article IV Staff Recommendation

Implementation

Fiscal Policy



Fully implement the 2012 fiscal reform. The
package passed in 2012 broadened the base of
the corporate and personal income taxes,
eliminated several VAT exemptions, increased
vehicle taxes, and streamlined customs duties. The
measures aimed to raise revenues by 11½ percent of GDP over the course of 2013 and
2014



Rebuild fiscal space and enhance fiscal
sustainability.

 The results of the 2012 tax reform have been

disappointing. The package has faced many
obstacles, including numerous claims before the
Constitutional Court. The tax administration has
been plagued with implementation and
governance problems, most markedly in the
customs agency. As a result, staff estimates that,
thus far, the reform has yielded around ¼ percent
of GDP in extra collections, well below initial
expectations.

 The fiscal deficit shrank in 2013, though as a result

of delays in IFI disbursements. Achieving fiscal
sustainability without cutting priority spending will
require higher fiscal revenue into the medium
term.

Monetary Policy and Financial Sector



The authorities should remain vigilant of lingering
inflationary pressures. Staff supported the increase
in the policy rate in 2013.



Staff cautioned on the high rate of credit growth,
particularly in dollars, and advised the authorities
to stand ready to take measures if the high growth
persisted.



The authorities should continue to modernize
financial regulations, with a special emphasis on
risk-based and consolidated supervision.



Inflation has remained within the target range
and inflation expectations have also fallen. The
authorities have recently made small reductions
to the policy rate.



The rate of credit growth tapered off at end-2013
and remained at lower levels.



While no new financial regulations were enacted,
the authorities continued technical work on riskbased supervision.

Exchange Rate Policy



Staff advised the authorities to enhance exchange
rate flexibility, in order to encourage dedollarization and reinforce the role of inflation as
the primary objective of monetary policy.



The authorities increased the fluctuation margin
for interventions in the foreign exchange market
from 0.65 to 0.7 percent of the five-day moving
average of the exchange rate. The level of
interventions has been minimal.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
September 12, 2014
1.
This statement provides additional information that has become available since the
staff report was issued. It does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Headline economic indicators remain in line with the baseline projection in the staff
report. August inflation was 3.7 percent y-o-y, still within the lower half of the central bank
target range, while the exchange rate has held at 7.7 Quetzales/USD. Fiscal revenues continue to
lag targets and the authorities have revised their forecasts for 2014 tax revenue downward,
closer to staff report projections.
3.
The Ministry of Finance has submitted the draft 2015 budget to Congress. The
proposal envisages somewhat higher revenue and expenditure than the baseline projection in the
staff report. The projected deficit, however, is in line with staff report forecasts after taking into
account expected spending execution constraints. Financing is somewhat tilted more toward
external sources than in the staff’s baseline.
4.
Drought conditions have worsened, but the macroeconomic impact is expected to be
negligible. The drought has mostly affected low-income farmers that produce for selfconsumption. About ¼ million rural families have been hit, and the government is providing
emergency assistance (some 0.1 percent of GDP) to alleviate the adverse social consequences.
The authorities are confident that the situation has been managed adequately, but are seeking
international food support, in case the drought lingers and its effects worsen. The authorities
have not changed their growth and inflation projections for this year, though some limited
upward pressures on food prices are possible.

Press Release No. 14/432
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 18, 2014

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Guatemala
On September 12, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Guatemala.1
Key developments since the 2013 Article IV Consultation have been positive. Growth has
returned to potential at around 3.5 percent and the output gap is closed. Inflation picked up
in 2013, but stayed within the target range and has declined in early 2014. The current
account deficit was virtually unchanged in 2013 at a relatively low level. Remittances have
remained robust, and the deficit is comfortably financed by stable Foreign Direct Investment
(FDI) and public sector borrowing. Net international reserves are at comfortable levels, and
external competiveness is broadly adequate.
The results of the 2012 tax reform, which aimed to raise revenues by 1-1.5 percent of GDP,
have been disappointing, yielding only 0.25 percent of GDP in extra collections. These, in
turn, were outweighed by shortfalls not related to the reform. Notwithstanding the overall
revenue shortfall, the fiscal deficit declined in 2013, amid delays in congressional approval
of International Financial Institutions loans.
Monetary policy has been slightly relaxed. Since November 2013, the policy rate has been
cut 75 basis points to 4.5 percent in the wake of falling inflation. The exchange rate has
remained stable, with minimal central bank intervention under its rules-based framework.
Credit has risen rapidly, slanted toward foreign currency loans, though it has recently slowed
and Financial Sector Indicators are solid. Banks have turned to greater reliance on wholesale
external funding but appear profitable, liquid, and well-capitalized.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

Guatemala has made strides toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals, but
poverty and crime are widespread. Extreme poverty has declined somewhat, primary
enrollment has risen, and maternal mortality has fallen. However, malnutrition of children
younger than 5 years is pervasive at about 50 percent. At the same time, the informal
economy is very large, while security concerns are very serious.
The macroeconomic outlook remains benign. Growth is expected to hold to its trend rate of
3.5 percent into the medium term and inflation to converge toward the center of the central
bank’s target range. The external current account deficit will stay stable and largely financed
by FDI. The baseline scenario envisages a broadly neutral budget stance in 2014 and modest
fiscal expansion through the 2015 election cycle, with measured consolidation thereafter.
However, downside risks are prevalent. In the near term, risks related to the normalization of
monetary policy in the U.S. are balanced, with the prospect of higher interest rates likely
more than offset by better export prospects as the U.S. economy expands. However, extreme
bouts of volatility in financial markets could inflict serious damage. Deeper-than-expected
slowdowns in emerging markets, less favorable-than anticipated-developments in Europe,
and disruptions in commodity markets due to geopolitical tensions could also hamper
Guatemalan growth. The continued lags in implementing the 2012 tax reform and the
political impasse on the 2015 budget may endanger much needed government programs. On
the other hand, if lower revenues are not met with spending cuts, fiscal consolidation could
be derailed. For the longer term, insufficient government revenue mobilization could persist,
deterring investment in physical and human capital. In turn, this could significantly weigh on
the country’s long-run growth and social prospects.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended Guatemala’s sound macroeconomic policies and welcomed
the broadly positive outlook. Directors noted, however, that poverty and social inequality
remain high and that risks are tilted to the downside. They encouraged the authorities to
accelerate efforts to improve social outcomes and foster higher, inclusive growth, while
continuing to strengthen macroeconomic management and resilience. Increasing fiscal
revenue will be particularly important.
With the output gap essentially closed, Directors viewed the current broadly neutral budget
stance as appropriate. They stressed the need to safeguard critical social and investment
spending in the event of financing shortfalls. In this context, implementation setbacks to
the 2012 tax reform should be addressed through strengthened tax and customs compliance.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. An explanation of any
qualifiers used in summing ups can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3

Directors also called for congressional passage of a 2015 budget and the timely approval of
multilateral loans. Improved budget execution and controls would help to stem the
accumulation of domestic arrears.
Directors recommended that fiscal sustainability be progressively strengthened over the
medium term in order to improve resilience and create space for increased priority spending.
Achieving a modest permanent improvement in the primary balance would require both
enhanced revenue mobilization and improvements to public expenditure management.
Directors stressed the need for a significant effort to raise revenues from their currently low
level in order to step up spending on health, education, security and infrastructure.
Directors viewed the monetary policy stance as broadly appropriate given low headline and
core inflation. They welcomed the authorities’ intention to remain vigilant and tighten
monetary policy should inflationary pressures re-emerge. Directors advised strengthening the
monetary transmission mechanism and policy framework by reinforcing the inflation target
as the primary objective of monetary policy, including through a gradual enhancement of
exchange rate flexibility. This could also weaken the incentive for dollarization and help
safeguard foreign reserves. Directors encouraged efforts to develop domestic debt and
securities markets.
Directors welcomed the significant regulatory and legislative reforms undertaken to
strengthen banking supervision and promote overall financial stability in response to the
previous FSAP. They encouraged the authorities to follow through on the recommendations
of the 2014 FSAP update, highlighting the importance of a gradual introduction of Basel III
standards, a further strengthening of consolidated supervision, improved regulation of
off-shore banks, and a further enhancement of the Anti Money Laundering/Combating the
Financing of Terrorism framework. Directors advised the authorities to consider the
adoption of macroprudential measures to control risks associated with dollarization.
Directors called for deep structural reforms and greater regional and global integration to lift
Guatemala’s growth potential and enhance social inclusion. Measures should aim to
strengthen competitiveness and improve the business climate, including security; strengthen
governance; and enhance the quality of education, so as to help reduce poverty and develop a
skilled and productive labor force.

Statement by Mr. Jose Alejandro Rojas, Executive Director for Guatemala
and Mr. Carlos Acevedo Flores, Alternate Executive Director
September 12, 2014
On behalf of my Guatemalan authorities, I would like to thank the staff for the balanced
report and constructive dialogue with the Fund during the 2014 Article IV consultation.
While my authorities broadly agree with the thrust of the Report, we would like to emphasize
the following issues:
1. Economic growth:
As the staff report rightly points out, Guatemala’s economy has performed solidly after
emerging from the global financial crisis, and the macro outlook is broadly positive. Real
GDP expanded 3.7 percent in 2013, up from 3.0 percent in 2012. And according to my
authorities it will continue to be strong in 2014, similar to that of the previous year, supported
by the dynamism in agricultural, manufacturing, construction, mining and financial services;
these estimates are confirmed by the current trend of the monthly index of economic activity
(IMAE), which increased 5.6 percent in July, taking the 12-month trailing average around
4.0 percent. This growth dynamic is in line with the Fund estimates for Guatemala’s growth
potential.
Inflation remains under control in 2014. By August 2014, y-o-y inflation was reduced to
3.7 percent while core inflation remains close to 2.0 percent. While prices accelerated in the
first half of 2013, mostly owing to fast rising food prices, inflationary pressures receded in
the second semester and closed at 4.4 percent that year, and it has remained below the center
part of the target range in 2014 (4 +/- 1 percentage point).
2. Fiscal stance
For many years, Guatemala has remained committed to a strong fiscal discipline, as
evidenced in its consistently low fiscal deficits and public debt-to-GDP ratios, which are
among the lowest in the region. In spite of the moderate results of the tax reform in 2012, the
fiscal deficit in 2013 narrowed to 2.1 percent of GDP, from 2.4 percent in 2012, mainly due
to a significant expenditure control. The fiscal deficit relative to GDP has averaged 2.1
percent in the last 20 years and it only exceeded the 3 percent mark during the worst years of

2

the past global recession, albeit during that period Guatemala bested several natural disasters.
Based on current trends, the authorities expect that the 2014 fiscal deficit will close at 2.1
percent of GDP. Consistent with those small fiscal deficits, public debt has been relatively
stable as a share of GDP, at around 25 percent.
As already mentioned, in 2012 the government pursued an ambitious tax reform, which
aimed at broadening the base of the corporate and personal income taxes, eliminating several
VAT exemptions, increasing vehicle taxes, and streamlining customs duties. The outcome of
the reform, although broadened the base of the corporate and personal income tax, was rather
modest, yielding well below of what was originally planned; reflecting some claims before
the Constitutional Court and hindrances associated to administrative shortcomings at the
customs agency. The authorities have reiterated their commitment to enhance tax collections
to continue strengthening fiscal sustainability over the medium term. To that end, the
Superintendency of Tax Administration has been developing a strategy to ensure the full
implementation of the reform coupled with administrative measures.
3.

Monetary and exchange rate policies

Since the adoption of the inflation targeting regime by Banco de Guatemala in 2005, the
monetary policy framework has served well the purposes of anchoring inflation expectations,
providing the opportunity for the monetary authorities to establish in 2013 a medium-term
inflation target of 4 percent (+/- 1 percentage point). Since 2012, inflation has remained
within that target. My authorities do not share the value judgment of the staff regarding the
decision to reduce the policy rate in November 2013, since there was not any concern
regarding economic growth, but a significant decrease in inflationary pressures. Even though
the staff considers that the monetary policy stance for 2014 is slightly expansionary, the
authorities have stressed that the behavior on the monetary base is in line with the
projections, economic agents expectations remain subdued, core inflation is below 2 percent
on annual basis, and credit growth has significantly decelerated (9 percent as of August);
however, the authorities have expressed their intention to remain vigilant to tighten monetary
policy if inflationary pressures emerge.
The exchange rate is flexible and the central bank only intervenes to moderate volatility but
not to change the trend. There is an explicit rule for intervention and it has become more
flexible year after year. Central bank interventions have been minimal and the foreign
exchange rate stability reflects mainly the prudent management of macroeconomic policies.

3

Overall, this policy framework has proven appropriate and has allowed Guatemala to
comfortably handle the risks related to the normalization of monetary policy in the U.S.
Therefore, my authorities do not share the staff´s view that this regime has not been seriously
tested so far (paragraph 25) since the country faced by end 2006 and early 2007 a banking
resolution process of one large bank and one small bank, coupled with foreign exchange
pressures associated with the cutting of credit lines of international banks to the Guatemalan
banking system in the face of the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 (that are not expected
to occur again, at least in the short-run). Those facts were clear examples of the regime’s
effectiveness. The HAPA approved by the IMF´s Executive Board to Guatemala in 2009 was
crucial to maintain stable market expectations, meaning that the rule is not the only
mechanism to face foreign exchange pressures; therefore, a more comprehensive discussion
of Guatemala´s exchange market with the staff would be desirable.
Moreover, the monetary authorities have broadly endorsed IMF advice to continue raising
gradually exchange rate flexibility, to credibly convey to the public that the inflation target is
their primary objective.
4. External sector
The current account deficit amounted to 2¾ percent of GDP in 2013. This deficit remained
mostly financed by steady FDI and other private capital flows. Net international reserves
(NIR) reached US$7.3 billion at end-2013, covering roughly 4.5 months of imports, and well
within the IMF’s composite reserve adequacy metrics. Thus far, there has not been any
significant impact from U.S. monetary policy normalization. On the other hand,
competitiveness seems broadly adequate, the external current account balance has improved
and Guatemala’s REER is generally in line with medium-term fundamentals according to the
IMF’s multilaterally consistent estimates.
5. Financial policies
The 2014 FSAP update found that Guatemala’s banking system appears to be generally
sound. More specifically, banks are profitable, liquid, well-capitalized, and generally resilient
to financial spillovers from advanced countries. Credit to the private sector has moderated to
only 9 percent at end August, from about 16 percent in 2012 and 12 percent by end-2013.
Foreign exchange credit, which represents less than one third of total credit to the private

4

sector, has continued growing; however, it has decelerated to 12.6 percent by end August
from almost 30 percent in 2011. Moreover, as a share of GDP, total credit has only recovered
to levels marginally above those before the global financial crisis, suggesting that its rise may
be mostly a catch-up phenomenon.
My authorities would like to highlight that significant reforms have been undertaken to
improve financial supervision and the regulatory framework since the previous FSAP in
2006. These reforms include actions to upgrade the regulatory framework and supervisory
practices, towards a more risk based approach and risk management issues. Also, measures
have been taken to strengthen the macroprudential monitoring and analysis, including the
strengthening of capacity building, inter-agency coordination and improved financial stability
analysis models. Furthermore, amendments to the Law of Banks and Financial Groups and
the Central Bank Organic Law entered into force in April 2013, covering offshore operations,
connected lending, supervisory enforcement powers and bank resolution procedures.
Regarding the Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism, it is
worth to mention that Guatemala has also joined GAFISUD, the Latin American regional
arm of FATF.
The authorities would also like to underscore that Guatemala’s banking system has proven to
be resilient to domestic and external shocks; the failure of two banks in 2006-2007 and the
global financial crisis did not spread to the rest of the system and the current stress test
prepared by the FSAP mission confirm that resiliency even to high levels of stress.
Management of those crises has also proven to be effective, given the strong coordination
within the Central Bank and the Superintendency of Banks, which allowed a timely adoption
of measures to mitigate potential impacts.
Overall, the authorities want to express their appreciation to the Fund for the thorough and
detailed work that underlies the report prepared by the FSAP mission team, and for the very
constructive dialogue that has taken place around the consultations for the Article IV. In
addition, they want to express their willingness to give due consideration to the
recommendations, where appropriate, that have risen from this dialogue and could further
contribute to enhance the financial system, the macroeconomic stability and inclusive growth
for Guatemala.
