STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 12, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context. The economy rebounded from the 2009 slowdown underpinned by buoyant
exports, domestic demand, and supportive macroeconomic policies. These started to be
tightened in 2011. A new government took office in January 2012, and has given priority
to strengthening the fiscal framework. While congress has remained fragmented,
coalition building has facilitated the passage of revenue-enhancing reforms.
Near-term outlook and risks. Growth and inflation are expected to moderate in 2012 in
line with the global slowdown and relatively stable world commodity prices. A
deterioration in global conditions could lead to a sharp fall in external trade and
remittance flows, with knock-on effects on real activity. Capital flows also would be
affected, but vulnerabilities seem limited.
Near-term policy mix. The gradual fiscal consolidation envisaged for 2012 is
appropriate. Rapid improvements in public expenditure management are necessary. A
neutral stance for monetary policy is appropriate as it is backed by a flexible exchange
rate. If global conditions deteriorate, the policy response should comprise greater
exchange rate flexibility, a moderate monetary easing, and automatic fiscal stabilizers.
Medium-term challenges. To address longstanding obstacles to economic performance
it will be important to push forward with reforms conducive to boosting output growth,
including adopting additional revenue measures to allow higher levels of spending in
critical areas (e.g. social programs, infrastructure, and security). It is also important to
continue strengthening the macroeconomic policy framework, and further upgrade
financial sector regulation and supervision.

The fiscal deficit has narrowed. The deficit

of the central government in 2011 was 2.8 percent
of GDP, down from over 3 percent in 2009 and
2010, and public debt has remained broadly stable
at 24 percent of GDP. Excluding reconstruction
expenditures (associated with the natural disasters
of 2010), the fiscal deficit in 2011 fell to 2.2 percent
of GDP, implying a negative fiscal impulse. Tax
revenues increased (partly owing to a tax amnesty),
while recorded expenditures were kept in check.
However, despite some improvements in budgetary
control, little progress was made in adopting a
strategy to avoid the recurrence of domestic arrears

The rule allows the central bank to intervene in the foreign
exchange market (by up to US$32 million per day) if the
exchange rate deviates by more than 0.6 percent in either
direction from its five-day moving average (the threshold
that triggers central bank intervention was 0.5 percent from
September 2009 until January 2011).

The results of a recent international audit suggest that the
stock of arrears incurred by a sample of line ministries could
have been on the order of 1.5 percent of GDP as of April
2011. However, the work of the audit firm was constrained
by limited collaboration from line ministries.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The near-term priorities are maintaining prudent macroeconomic policies, improving public
expenditure management, and being ready to respond in a timely manner to an adverse external
shock. Over the medium term, the main challenges are adopting growth-enhancing reforms,
strengthening the fiscal and monetary policy frameworks, and continuing financial sector reform.
There has been some progress in these areas since the 2009 Article IV consultation, but more needs
to be done (Box 1).
Box 1. Past Policy Recommendations
The previous Article IV consultation (IMF Country Report 10/36) highlighted the need to
implement moderate countercyclical policies to mitigate the impact of the 2008-09 crisis and a
comprehensive strategy to raise growth and reduce poverty. Directors recommended:


Implementing a prudent fiscal policy to strike a balance between supporting domestic
demand and keeping public debt in check. The authorities implemented a broadly neutral
fiscal stance in 2010-2011. The debt-to-GDP ratio rose modestly to 24.1 percent in 2011
(up from 22.9 percent in 2009).



Anchoring low inflation, through improvements in the monetary framework. Directors
stressed the importance of a vigilant monetary policy, a flexible exchange rate, and a strong
framework for monetary operations. In 2011, monetary policy was tightened, the band for the
exchange rate that triggers central bank intervention was widened, and the transition to a
coherent framework for short-term liquidity management was completed.



Increasing productivity and investment levels. Directors viewed as critical the
implementation of structural reforms aimed at enhancing the business environment and a
revenue-enhancing reform to help raise public investment and social spending. A revenue
reform and an anti-tax evasion law were approved in early 2012.



Advancing the banking reform agenda. Directors recommended implementation of the
amendments to the banking law and the regulations to improve liquidity and foreigncurrency credit management. Regulations on liquidity management, foreign-currency risks,
information technology, risk management, and the insurance sector have been implemented.

Box 2. Improving Public Expenditure Management
Some progress has been made in strengthening budgetary controls since 2010. The 2011
budget required that all contracts and purchase orders be accompanied by a “certificate of
budget availability.” In addition, the phasing out of contracts signed under the old procurement
law and the smaller role of trust funds also are likely to reduce the risk of new domestic arrears.
Nevertheless, weaknesses remain. A recent Fund technical assistance mission found that budget
rigidities hinder the allocation of resources to high-priority areas, limit the flexibility to respond to
shocks, and could interrupt payments for multi-year projects. It also found that internal systems
do not provide a reliable estimate of the outstanding stock of arrears and fail to ensure that
expenditure is recorded when the obligation is incurred.
The planned amendments to the organic budget law provide a unique opportunity to
improve public expenditure management. The technical assistance mission recommended
including in these amendments provisions to prevent new domestic arrears. In particular:


Limiting the earmarking of projects by the legislature and developing a medium-term
expenditure framework.



Facilitating investment projects by simplifying bidding procedures and assigning certificates of
budget availability for multi-year projects.



Establishing a contingency fund and a special contracting regime for emergencies.



Enhancing control of trust funds, establishing sanctions for non-compliance with budget norms,
and strengthening the treasury single account system.

Reducing the earmarking of revenue sources and improving cash planning would also be
important. Streamlining the earmarking of revenue could require legal or constitutional changes.
To ensure better recording of expenditure, it would be important to improve cash planning so
that monthly ceilings on expenditure are set in accord with the pace of budget execution. It would
also be key that internal auditors cross-check data entered into the system with information from
suppliers.

17.

The mission commended the

authorities for the revenue-enhancing
reforms approved in early 2012. With the
implementation of the planned enhancements
to tax administration, staff estimates that the
revenue reforms could yield close to 1 percent
of GDP in additional revenues in 2013 and up to
1.5 percent of GDP in 2015 (Box 3). This would
imply that tax revenues would rise to about
12.2 percent of GDP, similar to the level
observed in 2007.
18.

The authorities’ plans to improve the

transparency and efficiency of government
spending also are welcome. The newly-created
Ministry of Social Development will be in charge
of coordinating social programs and making
them more transparent (including by reducing
the reliance on trust funds). The authorities also
have submitted to congress initiatives to allow
the tax superintendency to have access to
banking information; reform the governance of
trust funds; permit a more active debt
management strategy; and a civil service reform.
While most of these reforms will likely help
increase fiscal transparency, the mission

19.

The mission supported the

authorities’ target of reducing the fiscal
deficit to 1.8 percent of GDP by 2015 but
urged them to deepen their revenue
mobilization strategy. Staff supported the
authorities’ plan to save part of the revenues
from the recent reforms to help reduce the fiscal
deficit to 1.8 percent of GDP by 2015, as it
would help stabilize the public debt-to-GDP
ratio. However, it encouraged them to step up
efforts to streamline the earmarking of revenues,
which reduces the flexibility of fiscal policy. The
mission urged the authorities to aim at
increasing the tax revenue ratio to at least
13.2 percent of GDP. It noted that such a level of
revenue would help achieve the goals of the
1996 Peace Accords and allow increased
spending in critical areas (e.g. social programs,
infrastructure and security). To achieve this gain,
the mission proposed reducing tax expenditures
and raising VAT rates to bring them into line
with regional peers (Figure 4). Despite initiatives
to broaden tax exemptions, the authorities
agreed that there may be scope to reduce some
of these exemptions, but considered that raising
VAT rates was not an option in the short term. In
addition, the effective implementation of the
existing anti-money laundering legal framework
should assist the authorities in enhancing tax
compliance and increase revenues.

The recently-approved revenue reform and anti-tax evasion law are expected to increase

The revenue package comprises:

A reform to the corporate income tax (expected yield of about 0.6 percent of GDP). It
envisages: (i) an increase in the tax rate on gross income over Q30,000 from 5 to 7 percent
(starting in 2013); (ii) a reduction in the tax rate on

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US
dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency
(e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent
of GDP) remain at their levels of the last projection year.

4/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 3/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
5/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 3/ as  (1+r).
6/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
7/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
8/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
9/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.

Safeguards Assessment. Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Bank of
Guatemala was subject to an assessment with respect to the Stand-By Arrangement approved on
April 22, 2009 (IMF Country Report No: 09/143). The assessment, which was completed in
September 2009, found that the Bank of Guatemala has strengthened safeguards in the areas of
financial reporting transparency and the management of foreign exchange reserves.
Recommendations were made to further strengthen the bank’s governance and independence.

Exchange Rate Arrangement. Since March 1994, Guatemala has had an arrangement
based on an interbank foreign exchange market in which authorized financial institutions buy and
sell foreign exchange at market-determined rates. Financial institutions authorized to operate in the
foreign exchange market include commercial banks, finance companies, and exchange houses.
While Guatemala has a de jure floating exchange rate arrangement, the de facto arrangement has
recently been reclassified as “stabilized”. As of April 4, 2012 the reference exchange rate was
Q7.69 per U.S. dollar.
IX.
FSAP participation. An FSAP was conducted on July 3–7, 2000 and on September 11–
23, 2000, and the Financial System Stability Assessment was discussed by the Executive Board on
May 14, 2001 at the time of the 2001 Article IV consultation. An FSAP update was undertaken during
October 27–November 10, 2005.

ANNEX 4. STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of April 4, 2012)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: In 2010, the Bank of Guatemala began publishing quarterly national accounts
statistics consistent with the SNA 1993, with 2001 as the base year.
Consumer prices: In 2011, the consumer price index was re-based to December, 2010, and the
index weights were updated to reflect changes in the consumption basket since the base 2000
index.
Government finance statistics: Revenue, expenditure, and financing statistics for social security
agencies, local governments, and nonfinancial public enterprises are not reported, hindering the
calculation of a consolidated operations statement and balance sheet for the nonfinancial public
sector. The coverage and periodicity of data on central government financing and debt is
adequate, but the detail of this data could be expanded.
Monetary and financial statistics: The quality, coverage, and periodicity of data for the Bank of
Guatemala and commercial banks is sufficient. Data for the offshore sector and savings
cooperatives is only available quarterly, and with a lag of five weeks.
External sector statistics: The Bank of Guatemala publishes quarterly balance of payments data
according to the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. In 2012, the Bank of Guatemala
increased the periodicity of publication of international investment position data from annual to
quarterly. Detail on private sector external debt by creditor and by maturity structure is not
available.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Guatemala became a participant in the General
Data Dissemination System in 2004. Several
data categories are yet to meet the periodicity
or timeliness requirements necessary for
subscription to the Special Data Dissemination
Standard.

A data ROSC was completed on October 28,
2004.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 8, 2012

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Guatemala
On April 30, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Guatemala.1
Background
Macroeconomic developments in Guatemala since 2010 have been broadly positive. Real
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 2.8 percent in 2010 and 3.8 percent in 2011,
underpinned by buoyant exports and domestic demand. High world oil and food prices
pushed up inflation to 7.6 percent in mid-2011 (from 5.4 percent at end-2010), but by early
2012 it had fallen within the central bank’s target range of 3.5–5.5 percent. While the
external current account deficit widened in 2011, the surplus in the capital account was
larger, partly due to banks’ increased access to foreign credit lines. As a result, the overall
balance of payments in 2011 recorded a surplus and net international reserves remained at
comfortable levels.
Policies were tightened in 2011. The deficit of the central government declined to
2.8 percent of GDP, down from 3.3 percent in 2010, helping maintain public debt broadly
stable at 24.2 percent of GDP. To limit second-round effects from higher commodity prices,
the monetary policy rate was increased by 100 basis points to 5.5 percent. The currency
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
appreciated moderately in nominal terms from early 2010 to April 2011 and has been
broadly stable since then, amid limited central bank intervention under the rules-based
framework.
The financial sector has remained stable, with adequate levels of liquidity and capitalization.
Private sector credit growth picked up and deposits in the banking system grew steadily.
The relative size of the offshore sector continued to decline and financial dollarization has
remained broadly stable. Full provisioning of non-performing loans was achieved in mid2011.
The economic outlook is generally positive. Real GDP growth is expected to moderate to
3.1 percent in 2012 driven by the global slowdown, and increase to 3.5 percent in the
medium term. Inflation is projected to decline to 5 percent in 2012 and fall gradually
thereafter to 4 percent. International reserves are expected to remain at comfortable levels.
However, the outlook is subject to downside risks related to the uncertain global
environment, particularly regarding slower-than-expected growth in the United States and
higher oil prices. Against this backdrop, the authorities are reducing the central government
deficit in 2012 to 2.4 percent of GDP, maintaining a neutral bias for monetary policy, and
preserving exchange rate flexibility.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Guatemala’s economic recovery and the favorable outlook,
considering that the policy stance for 2012 is broadly appropriate. Given the downside risks
posed by the uncertain global environment, it will be important to maintain prudent
macroeconomic policies and increase the readiness for timely policy responses.
Directors encouraged the authorities to improve public expenditure management. They
stressed the urgency of producing a reliable estimate of the stock of domestic payments
arrears and developing a plan to eliminate them. Directors indicated that the planned
amendments to the organic budget law provide a key opportunity to strengthen the fiscal
framework, and welcomed the submission to congress of draft laws aimed at improving the
transparency of expenditures.
Directors welcomed the recent passage of revenue-enhancing reforms. They underscored
the importance of further deepening revenue mobilization, including reducing tax
exemptions, to help ensure medium-term fiscal sustainability and allow higher levels of
government spending on social programs, infrastructure, and security. Directors called for
efforts to streamline revenue earmarks to enhance fiscal flexibility and reorient expenditures
to priority areas.
Directors encouraged the authorities to raise the effectiveness of monetary policy to anchor
low inflation, including by taking further steps to increase exchange rate flexibility. In this
context, they underscored the importance of greater operational autonomy for the central
bank.

3
Directors noted that strengthening the financial sector remains a priority. Securing
congressional approval of the amendments to the banking law, submitted in 2009, would
help lower risks from offshore operations and connected lending, improve resolution
procedures, and strengthen the instruments and size of the banking sector safety net.
Directors emphasized the need for further structural reforms to boost growth potential and
reduce poverty. In addition to fiscal reforms to mobilize revenues and improve public
expenditure management, Directors encouraged the authorities to implement the
competitiveness agenda, including improving the business environment.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Mr. Pérez-Verdía, Executive Director for Guatemala
and Mr. Cosenza Jiménez, Advisor to Executive Director
April 30, 2012
We would like to thank staff for their illustrative and balanced report and for their
constructive dialogue with our authorities. The authorities broadly concur with the staff’s
appraisal and we would like to emphasize the following points:
1.
Economic Growth. As staff has rightly pointed out, growth outlook is relatively
positive. Real GDP is expected to grow 2.9 - 3.3 percent in 2012 in line with global
economic perspectives and pick up to 3.3 - 3.7 percent in 2013, reflecting the envisaged
increase in both, internal and external demand. Business confidence has been increasing
consistently since October 2011, situation that, if effectively translated into investment, could
lead to a higher growth in 2012. In addition, the authorities are embarking on a
Competitiveness Agenda 2012-2021 which will prioritize human capital, investment in
infrastructure, improvements in governance and strengthening of institutions.
2.
Fiscal Policy. Guatemala has been characterized by low levels of fiscal deficit (1.7
percent of GDP in average, before the global economic and financial crisis of 2008-2009).
Given the impact on tax collection during the global crisis, the country adopted a
countercyclical policy that led to an increase of the fiscal deficit to 3.1 percent in 2009 and
3.3 percent in 2010. The authorities were fully aware of the importance to return to fiscal
discipline and initiated a process of fiscal consolidation by implementing policies aimed at
reducing the central Government’s deficit to 2.8 percent in 2011 and to further reduce it to
2.4 percent, 2.1 percent and 1.9 percent in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively, in order to
maintain public debt at sustainable levels in the medium term. Public debt remained at 24
percent of GDP during 2010-2011 and my authorities expect it should remain stable in the
following years. Tax revenues increased 15.8 percent in 2011 (y-o-y) and the tax burden
increased from 10.5 percent of GDP in 2010 to 11.0 percent of GDP in 2011, while public
expenditures increased 10.6 percent (y-o-y).
Furthermore, our authorities’ commitment to fiscal discipline is evinced by the steps taken by
the new administration that took office on January 14, 2012 immediately submitting to
Congress a tax reform that was approved together with an anti-evasion law, both measures
are expected to increase revenues by 1 percent of GDP in 2012 and by a total of 1.5 percent
of GDP in 2013 and onwards. To strengthen the quality of expenditure, make it more
transparent and to improve financial management, the authorities also submitted to Congress
two separate initiatives. The first initiative includes reforms to four laws: a) the Organic
Budget law; b) the Comptroller Office law; c) the Superintendency of Tax Administration
law, and; d) the Statistics and Geographical System law. The second initiative includes
reforms to four laws: a) the Procurement law; b) the Probity of Public Employees law; c) the
Organic Executive Branch law, and; d) the Civil Service law, plus the enactment of three
new laws: a) Illicit Enrichment law; b) Trust Funds law; and c) Planning and Evaluation of

2
Public Management law. The authorities will advocate for the prompt enactment of these
initiatives to ensure the adequate use of public funds.
3.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies. While inflation forecasts for 2012 indicate
inflation will lie within the target range of 4.5 percent (+/- 1 percentage point) and medium
term forecasts are consistent with the medium term target range of 4.0 percent (+/- 1
percentage points), recent increases in oil and food international prices are sources of
inflationary pressure. Although the monetary policy stance has been neutral since October
2011 (considering the uncertain prospects of world economic growth), the Central Bank
stands ready to adopt measures aimed at moderating inflation pressures, if needed. As
already mentioned by the staff the exchange rate is determined by the market and although
my authorities concur with the need to provide more flexibility, they have stressed the
importance of moving gradually to that goal, as long as the external environment remains
uncertain.
4.
External Sector. The Current account deficit is expected to reach 3.5 percent of
GDP and will be fully financed by FDI and other private capital flows. Our authorities
concur with staff that risks to the balance of payments are manageable.
5.
Financial Sector. Bank capitalization and liquidity are sound and non-performing
loans have decreased to 1.7 percent.
Finally, I would like to highlight Box 1, page 8 of the Staff Report, that reflect the fact that
the recommendations stemming from the previous Article IV Consultation Report have
largely been implemented.
We close by reiterating our appreciation for the thorough and detailed work that underlies the
report prepared by the IMF mission team. Our authorities appreciate the high quality
dialogue that resulted from their visit to Guatemala and will give due consideration to their
recommendations and observations.
